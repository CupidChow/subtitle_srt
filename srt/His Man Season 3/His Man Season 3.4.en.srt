(I'll peel it for you)

155
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,420
How?
(Seongmin: Can you peel (the orange) for me?)
(I'll peel it for you)

156
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,470
(Hwi: I just washed my hands.)

157
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:33,590
(Seongmin: But there can be juices. Wait.)

158
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,760
(Seongmin: Gosh I'm so out of energy.)

159
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,540
(Seongmin: Eat half of it.)

160
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,170
(Hwi: We've got to eat desserts.)

161
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,960
(Seongmin: There's a seven year age gap between us? For real?)

162
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,310
(Hwi: When Seongmin heard my age,)

163
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,760
(Hwi: I thought he might like me a little more.)

164
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,090
Because it’s the lucky number seven.
(Hwi: I thought he might like me a little more.)

165
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:56,370
Because it’s the lucky number seven.

166
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,290
(Shy)
(Because it’s the lucky number seven)
Because it’s the lucky number seven.

167
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,840
(Shy)
(Because it’s the lucky number seven)

168
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,880
(Hwi: But I think it's perfect.
Seongmin: Ah... An age gap of seven years?)

169
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,860
(Hwi: I like people older than me.
Seongmin: Did you only date people older than you previously?)

170
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,690
(Hwi: No, I just somehow like people older than me.)

171
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:25,080
(Seongmin: I'm a person who dreams of pure love.)

172
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,760
(Seongmin: Though I don't think I can get it.)

173
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,270
Well... It's somehow...

174
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,420
(Seongmin: Because I think too much.

175
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:34,700
Like someone in the service line of business?
(Seongmin: Because I think too much.

176
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,190
(Hwi: Like someone in the service line (?) of business?
Seongmin: Oh...)

Oh... But I'm also in the...

Seongmin: Oh...)

179
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:39,890
Thank you.
(Hwi: Like someone in the service line (?) of business?
Seongmin: Oh...)

180
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:40,540
Thank you.

181
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:40,600
But I'm also in the... Thank you.

182
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,390
(Suddenly)
But I'm also in the... Thank you.

(Hwi who's helping Seongmin throw away the peels)
(Thank you...)
But I'm also in the... Thank you.

(Hwi who's helping Seongmin throw away the peels)
(Thank you...)

185
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,500
(Hey, why are you so considerate...)

186
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,070
(Oh! Sweet man!)

187
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:52,810
Gosh what to do.

188
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,870
(Heart fluttering)
(What should I do)
Gosh what to do.

189
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,490
(Somehow embarrassed)

190
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,650
(Hwi: Gosh...)

191
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,390
(Seongmin: I can't open my eyes wide.
Hwi: Why?)

192
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:07,560
(Seongmin: I don't know either. My eyes look small, right?
Hwi: No? It's big.)

193
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,900
(Seongmin: Right now?
Hwi: Yeah.)

194
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,950
(Seongmin: Not from your perspective. But normally...)

195
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,600
(Hwi: But you look very cute when you're eating the oranges now.)

196
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,220
(Hwi: Let me take a photo for you.)

197
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:23,790
(Seongmin: Ah, photos. I'm ugly. I'm ugly.)

198
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:23,870
(Seongmin: I'm going to put some strength in my neck.
Hwi: Okay!)

199
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,870
I'm going to put some strength in my neck.
(Seongmin: I'm going to put some strength in my neck.
Hwi: Okay!)

200
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,870
Okay, I'll take it for you. One, two, three.

Okay, I'll take it for you. One, two, three.

203
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,770
(Hwi takes a photo for Seongmin)

204
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,000
It's good.
(Hwi takes a photo for Seongmin)

205
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,860
(Really!)

206
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,630
Look.
(Really!)

207
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:34,620
Not bad.

208
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,540
(Photo by Hwi)
Not bad.

209
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,659
(Photo by Hwi)

210
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:37,790
(Oh! It came out nice)

211
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,050
(Seongmin: My hair looks good.)

212
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,880
(Seongmin: It's the first time I've seen my hair objectively.
Hwi: But I really like this hairstyle.)

213
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,150
(Hwi: Oh, this is cute.
Seongmin: Why?)

214
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,620
(Why do you keep saying it's cute!)

215
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,980
(I'm seven years older than you! Don't you know?)
(Hwi: Ah, yes.)

216
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,320
(Hwi: But you're cute. Take an orange.)

217
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:08,120
(Youngjoon goes back to the room first)

218
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:17,320
(In order to finish the conversation he has with Myeongkyun, he has been waiting for him...)

219
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,520
(Nervous) (Anxious)

220
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,880
(Nervous)

221
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,890
(Youngjoon: I kept standing on the second floor, looking to see when he's going to come up.)

222
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,179
(Youngjoon: I waited for very long and he didn't come up.)

223
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,860
("You will be in a difficult situation...")

224
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,530
(It's like reading a script)

225
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,780
(Jaeseung: It feels like reading a script.)

226
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:48,720
You will be in a difficult situation...

227
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,890
(Acting like he's in a difficulty)
You will be in a difficult situation...

228
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,000
-What was it? -My back felt a little...
(Acting like he's in a difficulty)

229
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,890
-What was it? -My back felt a little...

230
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,710
(Looking around)
(Youngjoon asking Myeongkyun to come out)

231
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,830
(Looking around)

232
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:05,510
(Found him)

233
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,090
-At the back. -My nose is leaking.
(Found him)

234
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,090
(My nose is leaking)
-At the back. -My nose is leaking.

235
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,280
(My nose is leaking)

236
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:10,640
I want to go to the toilet.

237
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,650
(Glances over)
I want to go to the toilet.

238
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,700
(Myeongkyun leaves with going to the toilet as a reason)

239
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,370
(Youngjoon: What took you so long?
Myeongkyun: I wanted to eat the snacks.)

240
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,060
(Youngjoon: Huh?
Myeongkyun: I wanted to eat the snacks.)

241
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,080
(Youngjoon: I've been waiting for you for a long time.
Myeongkyun: Really?)

242
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,170
(Youngjoon: I waited for a long time and didn't see you coming so I thought of going over to get you.
Myeongkyun: Ah.)

243
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:25,870
(The two men walk into the room to talk)

244
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,990
-Which is my bed again? I don't remember.
-Here.
(The two men walk into the room to talk)

245
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,050
-Here and here.
-You have to sit here.
(The two men walk into the room to talk)

246
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:30,730
(The two men walk into the room to talk)

247
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,580
So I just wanted to ask you.

248
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,460
(Youngjoon: So I just wanted to ask you.)
So I just wanted to ask you.

249
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,620
(Youngjoon: So I just wanted to ask you.)

250
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:43,860
(Youngjoon: Should we tell others that we knew each other?)

251
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,490
(Youngjoon: Is it better if we just tell them today?)

252
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,120
(Youngjoon: Or that if they find out that we knew each other...)

253
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,320
(Youngjoon: it's kinda like... Since everyone is still at the stage of getting to know each other,)

254
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,220
(Youngjoon: and if they want to get to know you better, they have to take me into account too.)

255
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,020
(Youngjoon: Or that if someone's interested in me,)

256
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,300
(Youngjoon: they'd be wary of you. I'm afraid of situations like this.)

257
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:04,460
(Crunch)
(Youngjoon: That if it would be better)

258
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,060
That if it would be better
(Crunch)
(Youngjoon: That if it would be better)

259
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:07,720
if we tell everyone about this after the mid to later point.
(Crunch)
(Youngjoon: That if it would be better)

260
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,000
(Crunch)
(Youngjoon: if we tell everyone about this after the mid to later point.)
if we tell everyone about this after the mid to later point.

261
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,870
(Crunch)
(Youngjoon: if we tell everyone about this after the mid to later point.)

262
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:17,150
(Youngjoon: I wanted to discuss this with you before deciding.)

263
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,290
(Myeongkyun: If we wait a day before telling everyone.)

264
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,320
("Wouldn't it be more tense?")

265
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,860
(Youngjoon: No, that's not what I meant.)

266
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,920
(Gosh, I'm so frustrated!)

267
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,100
(Why?)

268
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,600
(Youngjoon: Be serious.
Myeongkyun: I'm left the group without an excuse...)

269
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:29,930
-So...
-That's not what's important.

270
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,230
(Youngjoon: That's not what's important.)
-So...
-That's not what's important.

271
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:31,760
(Youngjoon: That's not what's important.)

272
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,770
(Youngjoon: About this... We need a plan.)

273
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,280
(Youngjoon: Stop talking nonsense.
Myeongkyun: We can say it tomorrow. We can say it tomorrow.)

274
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,180
(Youngjoon: If it's for the "tense" atmosphere you're talking about, I don't agree to it.
Myeongkyun: Is that so?)

275
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,090
(Myeongkyun: Let's just talk about it. Comfortably.)

276
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:50,200
(Youngjoon: I talked a lot yesterday with the others yesterday.)

277
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,340
(Youngjoon: Compared to Myeongkyun,)

278
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,900
(Youngjoon: I think I'm more familiar with everyone.)

279
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,860
(Youngjoon: Because Myeongkyun just came,)

280
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,800
(Youngjoon: there's a process for him to get to know everyone,)

281
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,130
(Youngjoon: so I think I should follow what he thinks.)

282
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,970
(Youngjoon: So I asked him.)

283
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,940
(Youngjoon: But his answer sounds too much like he's joking.)

284
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,040
(Myeongkyun: Honestly I think...)

285
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,140
(Myeongkyun: discussing this is meaningless.)

286
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,290
(Myeongkyun There's no need to hide it.)

287
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,070
(Myeongkyun: But there's no need to tell everyone either.)

288
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,910
(Myeongkyun: That's what I think.)

289
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,440
(Myeongkyun: But he's been struggling. Whether we should tell everyone about our relationship.)

290
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,130
(Myeongkyun: I feel frustrated. I just feel frustrated.)

291
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:27,590
(Myeongkyun: Like... what? Why does that matter?)

292
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:35,350
(Youngjoon: Just like "we already knew each other from before," and be more comfortable.)

293
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,460
(Youngjoon: You don't have to worry about that. Just be comfortable.)

294
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,000
(Youngjoon: If this makes it more comfortable for you and for everyone,)

295
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,230
I think it's better to tell everyone today right away.
(Youngjoon: If this makes it more comfortable for you and for everyone,)

296
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,960
(Youngjoon: I think it's better to tell everyone today right away.)
I think it's better to tell everyone today right away.

297
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,000
(Youngjoon: I think it's better to tell everyone today right away.)

298
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,450
(Thinking carefully)

299
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:45,570
If I did what I wanted, and acted as if I know everything,
(Thinking carefully)

300
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,820
(Thinking carefully)
(Youngjoon: If I did what I wanted, and acted as if I know everything,)
If I did what I wanted, and acted as if I know everything,

301
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,440
(Youngjoon: I thought it could become complicated, so I wanted to first...)

302
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,390
(Youngjoon: talk to you about it.)

303
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,520
(Myeongkyun: Can't we say it tomorrow? When we are eating? After we eat.)

304
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,800
(Myeongkyun: If they insist on asking, just tell them.)

305
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,410
(Myeongkyun: If not, I think we can tekk them after dinner.)

306
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,200
(Youngjoon: That we don't have to hide it?
Myeongkyun: Yes.)

307
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,330
-You're right.
-If I go down now and tell everyone about it one by one...
(Youngjoon: That we don't have to hide it?
Myeongkyun: Yes.)

308
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:06,760
-You're right.
-If I go down now and tell everyone about it one by one...

309
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,350
(Myeongkyun: If I go down now and tell everyone about it one by one... It's a little that, isn't it?)
-You're right.
-If I go down now and tell everyone about it one by one...

310
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,470
It's a little that, isn't it? That I have to go there and...
(Myeongkyun: If I go down now and tell everyone about it one by one... It's a little that, isn't it?)
-You're right.
-If I go down now and tell everyone about it one by one...

311
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,990
(Myeongkyun: That I have to go there and...)
It's a little that, isn't it? That I have to go there and...

312
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,540
(Youngjoon: It's not to tell everyone one by one. But to tell them when everyone happen to be together.)

313
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,720
(I'm so frustrated I'm going to die)

314
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,170
(Myeongkyun: Let's say it tomorrow. Tomorrow.)

315
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,900
(Youngjoon: Why do you want to tell them tomorrow?)

316
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:26,220
(Youngjoon: Because you think what I said makes sense?)

317
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,160
(I can't be bothered to say it today)

318
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,700
(Nothing to say)
(Myeongkyun: Why? Why? Why think of it so complicated?)

319
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,590
Why? Why? Why think of it so complicated?
(Nothing to say)
(Myeongkyun: Why? Why? Why think of it so complicated?)

320
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,940
-I'm stressed.
-Why are you thinking of it so complicated?

321
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,010
(Stress!)
-I'm stressed.
-Why are you thinking of it so complicated?

322
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:33,820
(Stress!)

323
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,830
(Youngjoon: This is the most stressed I've been since I entered Men's House.
Myeongkyun: Why?)

324
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,430
(Youngjoon: He looked like he was fine with anything.)

325
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:43,170
(Youngjoon: And that this wasn't a big deal.)

326
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,400
(Youngjoon: So I think I got a little angry.)

327
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,740
(Myeongkyun: Because we were friends for a while.)

328
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,350
(Myeongkyun: I don't think this will affect)

329
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,080
(Myeongkyun: us looking for partners?)

330
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,920
(Myeongkyun: Even if I still like Youngjoon.)

331
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,510
(Myeongkyun: Though on his end, he personally thinks)

332
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,940
(Myeongkyun: he wants to draw a clear line on it.)

333
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,840
(Myeongkyun: That's why my response to him had some emotions mixed into it too.)

334
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:13,630
(Myeongkyun: I didn't mean to upset him.)

335
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,340
(Youngjoon: Don't just say "just like that," "I can't be bothered to say it," "what?"
Myeongkyun: Mm.)

336
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,020
(Youngjoon: Tell me what you think properly.)

337
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,270
(Youngjoon: Are you really can't be bothered to tell everyone about this?)

338
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:23,970
(Myeongkyun: Not that exactly.)

339
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,190
(Youngjoon: If you can't be bothered to say it,

340
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,520
(Youngjoon: I can say it for you.)

341
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,010
(Youngjoon: So can't you just tell me what you think properly?
Myeongkyun: Seriously?)

342
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,540
(Youngjoon: We can't continue to stay alone like this.)

343
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,440
(Youngjoon: Everyone is going around.
Myeongkyun: Yes.)

344
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,440
(Myeongkyun: Anyway...)

345
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:37,640
-I just came here today.
-Just like what I said.
(Myeongkyun: Anyway...)

346
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,090
(Myeongkyun: I just came here today)
-I just came here today.
-Just like what I said.

347
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,900
(Myeongkyun: I thought, "Wouldn't it be better if I look around at everyone first?")

348
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,900
-That's what I think so.
-Everyone.
(Myeongkyun: I thought, "Wouldn't it be better if I look around at everyone first?")

349
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,120
(Myeongkyun: Rather than telling everyone immediately today...)

350
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,960
(Youngjoon: About tomorrow night?
Myeongkyun: Around there? If they don't ask.)

351
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,980
(Youngjoon: They won't ask.)

352
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,840
("Hey")

353
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,540
(What?)
("Hey")

354
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,100
(What?)
(Nothing)

355
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:02,540
-Hello. -Hello.

356
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,140
(Hanmin suddenly came in at this time)
-Hello. -Hello.

357
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,160
(Hanmin suddenly came in at this time)

358
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,010
(Youngjoon: At that time, Hanmin suddenly opened the door.)

359
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,450
(Youngjoon: "Why does he keep following me?" That's what I thought.)

360
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,710
(Youngjoon: On the other hand, I was thinking, "Is he looking for me?")

361
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:22,470
(Hanmin: Yes, I'm following Youngjoon.)

362
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,170
(Hanmin: On the love fortune,)

363
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,360
(Hanmin: it said, "If there's someone you like,)

364
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,170
(Hanmin: it's better to take the initiative.")

365
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,950
(Hanmin: That's what was written on it.)

366
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:32,950
-Welcome. -Welcome.

367
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,870
(Welcome)
-Welcome. -Welcome.

368
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,060
(So stressed)

369
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,200
I'm so stressed I'm going to die.
(So stressed)

370
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,010
(So stressed)

371
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,150
(Mom)
(Why are you calling for your Mom?)

372
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,860
(Hanmin: What's wrong?)

373
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:43,380
I asked him something. He just said "I don't know."

374
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,550
(Because Hanmin suddenly appeared,
Youngjoon starts to talk nonsense)
I asked him something. He just said "I don't know."

375
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,360
(Because Hanmin suddenly appeared,
Youngjoon starts to talk nonsense)

376
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,010
-Youngjoon.
-Are you a T?

377
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:49,530
(Youngjoon: Are you a T?
Myeongkyun: Is it something I should be thinking about?)
-Youngjoon.
-Are you a T?

378
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,420
Is it something I should be thinking about?
(Youngjoon: Are you a T?
Myeongkyun: Is it something I should be thinking about?)

379
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,520
-T? T?
-Am I supposed to deliberate over it?
(Youngjoon: Are you a T?
Myeongkyun: Is it something I should be thinking about?)

380
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,320
(Youngjoon: (Your MBTI) ends with TP, right?
Myeongkyun: What was it again?)

381
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,000
(Myeongkyun: ENFJ!
Youngjoon: You are ENFJ?)

382
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,930
(Youngjoon: How could it be? I don't think so.
Myeongkyun: Why not?)

383
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:02,560
No. What are you?
(Youngjoon: How could it be? I don't think so.
Myeongkyun: Why not?)

384
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,770
(Myeongkyun: What are you?)
No. What are you?

385
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,640
(Myeongkyun: What's your MBTI?)

386
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,600
(Hanmin: Me? What do you think I look like?)

387
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,260
(Hmm...)

388
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,310
(Hanmin: He didn't get it right yet.)

389
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,470
(Myeongkyun: Firstly, you work so hard taking body profile photos...
Youngjoon: IN...)

390
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,080
(No, it's E)

391
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,590
(It's E)
(Youngjoon: You think he's an extrovert?)

392
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,000
(Youngjoon: You think he's an extrovert? Got it.)

393
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,700
(I) (E)

394
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,890
(IN) (ES)

395
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,880
(Youngjoon: INFJ.
Hanmin: Both of you are wrong.)

396
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,450
-He's the closest. -Really?
(Youngjoon: INFJ.
Hanmin: Both of you are wrong.)

397
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,650
(Hanmin: Youngjoon is the closest.)
-He's the closest. -Really?

398
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,130
-He's the closest. -Really?

399
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:29,220
-INFP. -This.

400
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,490
(Hanmin: INFP.)
-INFP. -This.

401
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,950
INFP.
(Hanmin: INFP.)

402
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,750
(Hanmin: INFP.)

403
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:38,900
(Youngjoon: INFP. You're a delicate person who gets hurt easily!
Myeongkyun: I don't know much about this.)

404
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:44,710
(Youngjoon: INFP will get hurt by me. Cause I will bully him.)

405
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,200
(Hanmin: I won't get hurt because of that.)

406
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,770
(Youngjoon: Because you're older?
Hanmin: No.)

407
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:51,850
-Hey. -Why are you doing this?
(Youngjoon: Because you're older?
Hanmin: No.)

408
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,580
-Hey. -Why are you doing this?

409
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,060
(Hanmin and Youngjoon are joking with each other
while Myeongkyun is just watching)
-Hey. -Why are you doing this?

410
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,800
(Make up!)

411
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,880
What is it again?
(Make up!)

412
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,160
You go first. I won't move. If you agree, just fist bump me.
(Make up!)

413
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,410
(OK)
(If you agree, just fist bump me)
You go first. I won't move. If you agree, just fist bump me.

414
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,890
-Okay. -Okay.
(OK)
(If you agree, just fist bump me)

415
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:07,830
(Youngjoon: Hanmin happened to enter both times

416
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:11,390
(Youngjoon: I was talking to Myeongkyun individually.)

417
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:16,200
(Youngjoon: It might be a big penalty.)

418
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,230
(Youngjoon: He might misunderstand my feelings.)

419
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,630
(Youngjoon: But because Hanmin came to me first,)

420
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,690
(Youngjoon: I don't want to miss out on this chance.)

421
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,450
(Jaeseung and Minseon meet)

422
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:35,180
Why do you look so down all of a sudden?

423
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,590
(Why do you look so down all of a sudden?)
Why do you look so down all of a sudden?

424
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,710
(Jaeseung: I don't know.
Minseon. What's wrong?)

425
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,060
(Jaeseung: I feel weird.
Minseon: What's wrong?)

426
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,830
(Jaeseung: Since you asked me, I should tell you. That'd only make sense.)

427
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,280
(Minseon: During dinner, it was a little...
Jaeseung: Hmm?)

428
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:53,770
(Minseon: Is it because of the conversation at dinner?
Jaeseung: Ah, well...)

429
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,990
(Jaeseung: Actually I already knew that I would be the oldest.)

430
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:01,940
(Jaeseung: But somehow...)

431
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:07,800
(Jaeseung: The people here are a lot younger than I thought they would be.)
(Ah...)

432
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:13,339
(Jaeseung: What should I talk about from now on?
Minseon: No one thinks that way. Don't worry.)

433
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:19,339
(Jaeseung: Seriously... I'm still getting goose bumps.
Minseon: Collect your emotions.)

434
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,589
(Minseon: It's so funny you're getting goosebumps hearing my age.)

435
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,970
Really.
(Minseon: It's so funny you're getting goosebumps hearing my age.)

436
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:24,869
(Minseon: It's so funny you're getting goosebumps hearing my age.)

437
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,310
(Jaeseung: But there's no excuse for that.)

438
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,650
(Jaeseung: I killed the conversation.)

439
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:37,700
Jaeseung. It doesn't make sense to say something to wrap it up.)

440
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,150
(Jaeseung: But (Minseon) does make me feel comfortable.)

441
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,720
And we have been getting along well.
(Jaeseung: But (Minseon) does make me feel comfortable.)

442
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,320
(Jaeseung: But (Minseon) does make me feel comfortable.)

443
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,450
(Jaeseung: Actually, I called you yesterday.)

444
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,450
Jaeseung: I wanted to get closer to you.)

445
00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:03,260
(Jaeseung: Of course, thank you for calling me.)

446
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,880
(Jaeseung: I thought wanting to get closer to you also means I quite like you.)

447
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,270
(Jaeseung: That's why I called.)

448
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,980
(Jaeseung: That it's the kind of like between friends)

449
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,690
(Jaeseung: rather than a couple. That's what I wanted to tell him.)

450
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,490
(Jaeseung: That way, Minseon won't misunderstand.)

451
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,910
(Minseon: After knowing everyone's age,)

452
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,250
(Minseon: I have been thinking a lot.)

453
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,920
(Minseon: I can feel that he's a little burdened.)

454
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,150
(Minseon: So I was worried too.)

455
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,520
(Text message ring tone sounding in Men's house)

456
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,260

Hwi: You didn't see the text?)

466
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:00,840
I didn't see it.
(Seongmin: Where did everyone go?

(Seongmin: Do I have to (call)?)

474
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,040
(Hwi: I'm running away.)

475
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:20,120
(It's the second call time at Men's House)

476
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,270
(What are the men thinking now?)

477
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:31,060
(Men who are organizing their thoughts either alone or together)

478
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,370
(Jaeseung: I kinda gave up today.)

479
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:45,960
(Jaeseung: I don't think anyone will call me.)

480
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,150
(Youngjoon: I think Myeongkyun might)

481
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,750
(Youngjoon: call me.)

482
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,610
(Youngjoon: Afterwards, I think I have been focusing on Hanmin.)

483
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,880
(Myeongkyun: Should I not be here (living room)?)

484
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,270

485
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:15,980
(Myeongkyun who is not used to the call time yet)

486
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,190
(Whoosh)

487
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,200
You startled me.
(Whoosh)

488
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,270
(Seongmin: Come on in.
Myeongkyun: I heard a sound here.)

489
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:22,870
(Seongmin: Let's stay together.)

490
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:23,300
What?
(Seongmin: Let's stay together.)

491
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,140
Let's stay together.
(Seongmin: Let's stay together.)

492
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,050
(Myeongkyun: I was sitting in the middle of the living room...)

493
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,820
(Myeongkyun: I thought I was being too brazen.)

494
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,200
(Seongmin: You were alone?
Myeongkyun: Yes.)

495
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,180
(Seongmin: It must be difficult for you since we just met.
Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

496
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,340
(Hwi: Have you decided who to call?)

497
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:37,540
-Me? -Yes.
(Hwi: Have you decided who to call?)

498
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,430
(Myeongkyun: Me?)
-Me? -Yes.

499
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:38,950
-Me? -Yes.

500
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,410
(Myeongkyun: I'm still thinking about it.)

501
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:46,500
(Seongmin, Hwi, and Myeongkyun who went on a date during the day)

502
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,250
It's here.

503
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:49,840
(Myeongkyun, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)
It's here.

504
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,850
(Myeongkyun, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)

505
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,230
(Oh my)

506
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:06,010
(Myeongkyun who walks to the phone booth in a nervous mood)

507
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:17,620
(Myeongkyun: Actually I think... I haven't collected my thoughts yet.)

508
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:22,150
(Myeongkyun: How would these people think of me?)

509
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:30,050
(The man who has entered Myeongkyun's heart
on his first day here is?)

510
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:52,630
(Thinking)

511
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,420
(Myeongkyun: Ah... What should I do?)

512
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,510
(Myeongkyun: Ah... Please.)

513
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:12,680
(Myeongkyun: Calls after hesitating for a long time.)

514
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,090
(Myeongkyun: Hello?)

515
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,350
That could happen.

516
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,500
To make the atmosphere a little better.

517
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,520
If I hear a compliment or–

518
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:32,470
(Myeongkyun's choice is)

519
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,280
Hello?
(Myeongkyun's choice is)

520
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,870
(Myeongkyun's choice is)

521
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:34,890
(Myeongkyun chose Hanmin)

522
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:35,890
Hello?
(Myeongkyun chose Hanmin)

523
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,030
(Myeongkyun chose Hanmin)

524
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,920
(Myeongkyun: Hello?
Hanmin: Hello.)

525
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,510
(Youngjoon's expression that stiffens
because of the call for Hanmin)

526
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,970
(Myeongkyun: I thought about it for a long time.)

527
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:50,330
(Myeongkyun: So I just tried to call you.)

528
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,420
(Hanmin: Thank you)

529
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:06,590
(Myeongkyun: I'm not good at saying cheesy words...)

530
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,700
(Myeongkyun: Is the time up already? So quickly?)

531
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,200
(Myeongkyun: Hello?)

532
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,630
(Gosh, this is bad)

533
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,760
(Youngjoon: It hangs up automatically in 30 seconds.)
(Ah...)

534
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:21,820
Do you know who it is?
(Youngjoon: It hangs up automatically in 30 seconds.)
(Ah...)

535
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,860
(Ah...)
(Youngjoon: Do you know who he is?)
Do you know who it is?

536
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,560
(Ah...)
(Youngjoon: Do you know who he is?)

537
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:23,970
I can't be sure.

538
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,760
(Hanmin: I can't be sure.
Youngjoon: You're not familiar with the voices yet, right?)
I can't be sure.

539
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,130
-You're not familiar with the voices yet, right?
-Yeah.
(Hanmin: I can't be sure.
Youngjoon: You're not familiar with the voices yet, right?)

540
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,200
(Youngjoon: They didn't tell you who they are, right?
Hanmin: Yeah.)

541
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,500
(Gosh!
This is so hard!)

542
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,170
(Myeongkyun: I thought about it a lot.)

543
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:40,150
(Myeongkyun: And decided to call Hanmin in the end.)

544
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:44,330
(Myeongkyun: I wanted to ask him)

545
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,240
(Myeongkyun: if he's interested in Youngjoon.)

546
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,230
(Hanmin: I thought about who it could be who called me.)

547
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:56,340
(Hanmin: It was also in a situation where I was with Youngjoon.)

548
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,600
(Hanmin: I felt flustered.)

549
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,750
(Hanmin: To be honest, I was in a good mood.)

550
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,700
I couldn't hear the voice. I couldn't hear it.

551
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,900
Because...

552
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:10,210
It's your turn.

553
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,220
(Hanmin, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)
It's your turn.

554
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,770
(Hanmin, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)

555
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,200
(Bye)

556
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,260
(Hanmin: Bye.)

557
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,250
(Hanmin: I will be back)

558
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,360
(Youngjoon: We were together, and after he left, it was just me.)

559
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,920
(Youngjoon: I felt anxious.)

560
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,050
(Youngjoon: I thought I shouldn't be too sad even if I don't receive the call.)

561
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,110
(Hanmin: If I have to pick a first and second place,)

562
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:43,020
(Hanmin: Youngjoon ranks first in my first impressions, and Seongmin second.)

563
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:48,650
(Another new man
Hanmin's first call will be for?)

564
00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:01,310
(After taking a deep breath,
Hanmin picks up the phone excitedly)

565
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:21,710
(Hello?
Hanmin: Hello?)

566
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,950
("Hello, friend?")

567
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:33,790
(Hanmin calls Youngjoon for his first call)

568
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:38,610
(Youngjoon: Hello?
Hanmin: Hello?)

569
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,980
(Hanmin: Hello, friend?)

570
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:47,220
(Hanmin: I had fun today. Let's go on a date tomorrow too.)

571
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,900
(Sure)

572
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,390
(Hanmin: See you later. Bye.)

573
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,880
(Youngjoon: He's hanging up so quickly?)

574
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:09,240
(Youngjoon: I was so happy. I couldn't stop smiling.)

575
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,980
(Youngjoon: I felt like I was possessed by a teenager.)

576
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,440
(Youngjoon: I was tossing and turning around.)

577
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:30,100
(Hanmin: When he sat next to me, and was smiling

578
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,010
(Hanmin: and talking to me happily,)

579
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:36,330
(Hanmin: I took an interest to him.)

580
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,880
(Youngjoon and Hanmin meet again
after the call)

581
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:49,040
(Youngjoon: That's what happens if you're in the same room.)

582
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,040
(Youngjoon: Why did you hang up after 20 seconds?)

583
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,540
What?
(Youngjoon: Why did you hang up after 20 seconds?)

584
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,540
Why did you hang up after 20 seconds?

585
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,360
(Hanmin: I was shy.)

586
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,520
(Youngjoon: Am I blushing? No, right?
Hanmin: A little bit?)

587
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:03,820
-Where were we?
-I don't remember.

588
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,050
(Hanmin: Where were we?)
-Where were we?
-I don't remember.

589
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,030
(Hanmin: Where were we?)

590
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,020
(Youngjoon: What did we talk about? I can't even remember the topic.)

591
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,500
-I think so too.
-What's wrong?

592
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,970
(Hwi: I came to get some medicine.)

593
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,380
(Youngjoon: Just come in. It's not our room.
Hwi: Oh right, this is my room.)

594
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,780
Oh right, this is my room.

-I'm so sorry.
-We have to read the room.
(Youngjoon: Just come in. It's not our room.
Hwi: Oh right, this is my room.)

597
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,030
-I'm so sorry.
-We have to read the room.

598
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,280
Have a safe trip.

599
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:21,480
(Hwi, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)
Have a safe trip.

600
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,770
(Hwi, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)

601
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,150
Take it out. Take it out.
(Hwi, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)

602
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,080
What should I do?
(Hwi, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)

603
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,790
(Hwi, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)

604
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,070
(Hwi: Jaeseung called me yesterday.)

605
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:38,400
(Hwi: I thought about it. Should I call Jaeseung?)

606
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:44,610
(Hwi: But I like people who like me a lot too,)

607
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,620
(Hwi: so I'm more attracted to him.)

608
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:59,860
(Hwi calls without any hesitation)

609
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,450
(Hwi: Hello?)

610
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:17,270
(Hello. Who are you?)

611
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,420
(Ah...)

612
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,630
(After yesterday, Hwi called Seongmin again today)

613
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,550
(Seongmin: Hello. Who are you?)

614
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:32,300
(Hwi: I want to tell you I had a great date today.)

615
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:40,080
(Hwi: I had fun all day.)

616
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,180
(Seongmin: I also had a good time at the date.)

617
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:52,390
(Hwi who expresses his feelings
in a straightforward manner)

618
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:02,460
(Hwi: Other than Seongmin, I talked a lot with other people.)

619
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:08,090
(Hwi: But the person who makes me happy was Seongmin.)

620
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:08,130
(Hwi: So I think my feelings (for Seongmin) won't change...)

621
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,310
So I think my feelings won't change...
(Hwi: So I think my feelings (for Seongmin) won't change...)

622
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:13,290
(Hwi: So I think my feelings (for Seongmin) won't change...)

623
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:18,230
(On one hand
Seongmin looks a little conflicted)

624
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,380
I've been watching.

625
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:19,650
(Hearing Seongmin's voice from the living room)
I've been watching.

626
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,560
(Hearing Seongmin's voice from the living room)

627
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,020
What's going on? It works.
(Hearing Seongmin's voice from the living room)

628
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,090
(Hearing Seongmin's voice from the living room)

629
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,960
(Found Seongmin)

630
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,050
Deoksoon...
(Found Seongmin)

631
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:27,960
(Found Seongmin)

632
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:28,500
Deoksoon...

633
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,850
(Found Hwi)
Deoksoon...

634
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,430
(Found Hwi)

635
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,140
(Youngjoon: You're roommates.
Hanmin: Oh right, roommates.)

636
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:43,140
(That must be nice,
sharing a room with your roommate!)

637
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,250
Is it your turn?

638
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:47,920
(Seungjin, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)
Is it your turn?

639
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,780
(Seungjin, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)

640
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:51,720
Today's a speed run.

641
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,050
(Today's a speed run (?))
Today's a speed run.

642
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,160
(Today's a speed run (?))

643
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:03,700
(Seungjin: The reason I called the person yesterday was very straightforward:)

644
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,090
(Seungjin: I'm just grateful to him.)

645
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:10,810
(Seungjin: But on a day like this, can I express my feelings now?)

646
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:17,150
(On a day like this,
who is Seungjin going to express his feelings to?)

647
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:38,340
(Seungjin: Hello?)

648
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,530
(Jaeseung: Hello?
Seungjin: Hello?)

649
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:50,790
(Jaeseung: Hello.)

650
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:56,100
(Seungjin: I had a good time at the date today.)

651
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,990
(Seungjin: Thank you for picking out my fish bones.)

652
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,690
(Jaeseung: Really... Thank you so much for calling me.)

653
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:06,520
(Seungjin: And I put out the polaroid in the entertainment room.)

654
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,340
(Jaeseung: I got it.)

655
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,230
(Seungjin: Have a good night.)

656
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,890
(Jaeseung: Have a good night. Thank you for calling.)

657
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:13,760
(Seungjin: Okay.)

658
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,020
(Jaeseung: Mm.)

659
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,930
(Jaeseung: You're so kind...)

660
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,870
(Jaeseung: I did think that)

661
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:36,240
(Jaeseung: Seungjin might call me.)

662
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,820
(Jaeseung: Seungjin made me feel very comfortable today)

663
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:45,780
(Jaeseung: and he said he felt a lot more relaxed today.)

664
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,990
(Jaeseung: Of course I'm grateful to him.)

665
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:59,660
(Seungjin: I rarely meet someone who takes care of me well like this.)

666
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:05,070
(Seungjin: Seeing his behavior... I really started to like him.)

667
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:10,760
(Seungjin: I was thinking I wish I had a brother like him.)

668
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,750
(Stumping)

669
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,630
(Seongmin: I heard it.)

670
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,540
(Seungjin: You heard it?
Seongmin: Your call.)

671
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,920
(Seongmin: Sitting here, you get to hear everything.)

672
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,350
(Seungjin: Are they all there?)

673
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,340
No– It's here.
(Seungjin: Are they all there?)

674
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,090
(Seongmin, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)

675
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:33,170
-I'll be back.
-Bye.
(Seongmin, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)

676
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:35,000
(Seongmin: I'll be back.)
-I'll be back.
-Bye.

677
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:46,890
(Seongmin: To be honest, I didn't really want to call for the second call)

678
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,310
(Seongmin: today.)

679
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:04,540
(Seongmin: I felt conflicted.)

680
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:10,490
(Seongmin: Gosh... Seriously...)

681
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:16,920
(Seongmin who looks conflicted
even from the back)

682
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,940
(Seongmin: Can I... call myself?)

683
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,970
(Seongmin: I really want to call myself)

684
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:27,300
(Seongmin: What should I do?)

685
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,250
Gosh really...
(Seongmin: What should I do?)

686
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,200
(Seongmin: I thought, I can't do this.)

687
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,890
(Seongmin: And at that moment I made the decision and pushed the button.)

688
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,110
(Seongmin: It's me, Seongmin.)

689
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,390
It's me, Seongmin.

690
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,170
(Jaeseung: What's going on?)

691
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,100
(Seongmin: Let's talk.)

692
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,239
(Jaeseung: You want to talk?)

693
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:13,530
(Seongmin: Yes, if we have a chance in the future.)

694
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,080
(Seongmin: I'm hanging up.)

695
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:20,190
(Jaeseung: Thank you for calling.
Seongmin: Okay.)

696
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:24,880
(Jaeseung: I was surprised.)

697
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:29,179
(Jaeseung: I thought he had fun with Hwi today.)

698
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:34,800
(Jaeseung: I thought there would be no room for me to step in)

699
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,070
(Jaeseung: between the two of them.)

700
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:43,080
(Jaeseung: I'm in a good mood. But I'm a bit flustered.)

701
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:48,949
(Jaeseung: What's going on?)

702
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:52,540
(Jaeseung: What's going on...)

703
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:56,889
(After a long thought, Seongmin called Jaeseung)

704
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:15,040
(Pause)

705
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,070
(Seongmin: I can't go in now...)

706
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:27,450
(Entering with his shoes on)

707
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,990
(Seongmin: Gosh... I can't go back to the room.)

708
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,240
(Quietly)

709
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:47,080
(Seongmin still looks conflicted)

710
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,400
College student.

711
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:53,890
(Hwi: Is my phone dead?)

712
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:54,590
(The two men's hearts that diverted
during the second phone call)

713
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,690
Gosh.
(The two men's hearts that diverted
during the second phone call)

714
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:59,920
(The two men's hearts that diverted
during the second phone call)

715
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,660
(Bugles on my hand)

716
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,200
(Minseon: I rarely eat snacks.)

717
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,170
(Minseon: I eat snacks when I drink. Other than that, not really.)

718
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:16,610
(Myeongkyun: I rarely drink alcohol. Alcohol...)

719
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:21,000
(Minseon: After I went to college, when preparing for performances,)

720
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,090
(Minseon: at the start, people would come together and drink at what they call starting parties.)

721
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:32,400
(Myeongkyun: Ah yes. I was in a theatre club too.)

722
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,940
(Myeongkyun: When I was in college, there were many activities like that.)

723
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,830
At the end...

724
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,030
(Minseon, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)
At the end...

725
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,230
Something like that.
(Minseon, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)

726
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:37,400
(Minseon, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)

727
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,270
No way.
(Minseon, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)

728
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,100
(Minseon: I'll be back.
Myeongkyun: Buy Melona on your way back.)

729
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,620
(Minseon: I'll buy Melona on my way back.)

730
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,110
(Minseon leaves his position...
Leaving Myeongkyun alone)

731
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,850
(Somehow waiting for a call)

732
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,200
(Myeongkyun: There's no phone call...)

733
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:11,410
(Is Minseon's heart different from yesterday?)

734
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:16,020
(Minseon: It's totally different from yesterday.)

735
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:20,960
(Minseon: Before this call time, I thought about it for a long time.)

736
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:27,390
(After careful consideration, which man did Minseon call?)

737
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:36,940
(Hello?
Minseon: Instead of Melona, you get a phone call.)

738
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,310
Hello?

739
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,080
(Minseon calls Myeongkyun)
Hello?

740
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,280
Instead of Melona, you get a phone call.
(Minseon calls Myeongkyun)

741
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:40,920
(Minseon calls Myeongkyun)

742
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,280
(Myeongkyun: Well... Okay.
Minseon. Eh? What?)

743
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,370
What?
(Myeongkyun: Well... Okay.
Minseon. Eh? What?)

744
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:48,730
(Minseon: I said, instead of Melona, you get a phone call.)

745
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,740
(Myeongkyun: Hello.)

746
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:53,000
(Minseon: Hello.)

747
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,030
Then...

748
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,380
(Myeongkyun: Thank you.)

749
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,460
(Minseon: The call time is short so I can't talk much.)

750
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:07,270
(Minseon: Let's wrap today up nicely.)

751
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:11,570
(Myeongkyun: You worked hard.)

752
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,500
(Myeongkyun: I was actually very happy.)

753
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,980
(Myeongkyun: I'm sure he knew I have already gone out.)

754
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:27,660
(Myeongkyun: What would he think about me having not called him?)

755
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,610
(Well)

756
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,260
(I'll be in here)

757
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:34,320
I'll stay in here, seriously.
(I'll be in here)

758
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,520
I'll stay in here, seriously.

759
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:39,750
(Shy)

760
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:44,470
(Myeongkyun: Although I think this may be selfish.)

761
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:48,840
(Myeongkyun: as I felt relieved, I was also really happy.)

762
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:59,830
(Arranging Minseon's bed)

763
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:06,680
(Minseon: Myeongkyun has been showing a playful side of him.)

764
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:11,230
(Minseon: I think we had a good chat.)

765
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:14,110
(Minseon: So among these people, I want to know him more.)

766
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,700
(Minseon: I also got the feeling that)

767
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:20,590
(Minseon: he's someone I'll like.)

768
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:27,640
(Laughing)

769
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,650
Gosh.
(Laughing)

770
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:29,640
(Laughing)

771
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,140
What are you doing?

772
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:33,840
(Minseon: What? Who? Who? Me?)

773
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,990
So funny.
(Minseon: What? Who? Who? Me?)

774
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,570
(Minseon: What? Who? Who? Me?)

775
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:36,740
-Hello. -Hello.
(Minseon: What? Who? Who? Me?)

776
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,160
-Hello. -Hello.

777
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,730
(Embarrassed)
-Hello. -Hello.

778
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:38,600
(Embarrassed)

779
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,260
What?
(Embarrassed)

780
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,360
No.

781
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:44,330
(Minseon: What shoes are you wearing?)

782
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,390
(Are you wearing shoes? -Oh, am I crazy?)

783
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,100
I'm sorry.
(Are you wearing shoes? -Oh, am I crazy?)

784
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,860
Am I crazy?

785
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,250
(Seongmin: I'm sorry.)

786
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,070
(Seongmin: It's because I'm too nervous.)

787
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,090
(Seongmin: I really thought I was wearing indoor slippers.)

788
00:39:58,690 --> 00:39:58,930
I was surprised when I saw the shoes.

789
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,990
(Minseon: I was surprised when I saw the shoes.)
I was surprised when I saw the shoes.

790
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,110
(Minseon: I was surprised when I saw the shoes.)

791
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:05,960
(Seungjin: It's funny. -Seongmin: I'm sorry. I'm sorry~)

792
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,960
(Seongmin: I really thought I was wearing indoor slippers.)

793
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,830
(Myeongkyun: I don't mind. -Minseon: I don't mind, too.)

794
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:14,240
(Myeongkyun: If you look at the last scene of The Shawshank Redemption,)

795
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:19,580
(Myeongkyun: the male lead walks out really confidently.)

796
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,070
(Myeongkyun: But the shoes he's wearing aren't leather shoes)

797
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:26,280
(Myeongkyun: but prison shoes instead.)

798
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:30,490
(So?)

799
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,980
No, really, so?
(So?)

800
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:37,670
(Myeongkyun: When people)

801
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,810
(Myeongkyun: meet someone new for the first time, they only care about their clothes.)

802
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:43,090
(Myeongkyun: I think only one out of 100 people will also notice the shoes.)

803
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:43,300
-Really? -Yes.
(Myeongkyun: I think only one out of 100 people will also notice the shoes.)

804
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,570
(Minseon: Ah, really? I suddenly became someone great.)
-Really? -Yes.

805
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,000
I suddenly became someone great.
(Minseon: Ah, really? I suddenly became someone great.)

806
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,450
But we already all know each other.
(Minseon: Ah, really? I suddenly became someone great.)

807
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:51,590
(Myeongkyun: He's a good judge of character.)

808
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:55,360
(Myeongkyun: I kind of wanted to compliment him for having good observation)

809
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,800
(Myeongkyun: even though he was joking around.)

810
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,840
(Myeongkyun: But that's what I thought of at that time.)

811
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,390
(Jaeseung: "Who should I call?")

812
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:14,510
(Jaeseung: was what I was mainly thinking about.)

813
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:23,210
(Jaeseung, please come to the phone booth and call someone you like within 30 seconds.)

814
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:31,990
(Jaeseung is in a very complicated mood today.)

815
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:42,070
(After careful consideration, which man did Jaeseung call?)

816
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:04,600
(Jaeseung: Hello.)

817
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,290
(Jaeseung: I'm Cha Jaeseung.)

818
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,570
(He's so popular.)

819
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,730
(Seongmin: Hello? -Jaeseung: Hi.)

820
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:20,060
(Seongmin: Who are you?)

821
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:24,900
(Jaeseung chooses Seongmin today.)

822
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:31,050
(Let's talk.)

823
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,270
(A date is nice, talking is nice, too.)

824
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:44,290
(Seongmin: Wait, I'm too nervous right now. I'm speechless.)

825
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:47,780
(Shall we have a drink today?)

826
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:57,660
(It's been 30 seconds. He hung up.)

827
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:04,460
(Unlike yesterday, Jaeseung called Seongmin)

828
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,360
(Seongmin: Ah, he hung up.)

829
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:15,490
(Seongmin: Honestly, Jaeseung calling me)

830
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,240
(Seongmin: was something I never expected.)

831
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:21,250
(Seongmin: Also, Seungjin was next to me telling me how he called Jaeseung.)

832
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,380
(Seongmin: We were talking about this)

833
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,190
but then he suddenly called me so I was a little flustered.
(Seongmin: We were talking about this)

834
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:26,470
(Seongmin: but then he suddenly called me so I was a little flustered.)
but then he suddenly called me so I was a little flustered.

835
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:31,190
(Seongmin: But I was really happy when I picked up.)

836
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:35,120
(Seongmin: As soon as I picked up, I was happy. I was in a good mood.)

837
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:41,870
(Jaeseung: An important reason to why I called Seongmin was because)

838
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:45,320
(Jaeseung: I actually got a call from Seongmin first.)

839
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:51,110
(Jaeseung: The minute when he confessed to me)

840
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:54,000
(Jaeseung: I realized that there was nothing to hesitate about.)

841
00:43:54,470 --> 00:44:00,280
(Jaeseung: With Hwi, because he didn't call me,)

842
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,670
(Jaeseung: he might not like me that much.)

843
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:13,430
(Seongmin: It's been a long time since I've been this anxious.)

844
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:19,080
(Seungjin: Oh? Who left just now?)

845
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,030
(Seungjin: I'm kind of glad I came down to the first floor.)

846
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:26,660
(Seungjin: All my questions are solved.)

847
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:30,410
(Seungjin: All my questions are solved.)

848
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,980
(Seungjin: Didn't Jaeseung go out just now?)

849
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:40,390
(Awkward Seungjin: Wow, so you got a call from Jaeseung?)

850
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:40,520
Okay, it's a secret.
(Awkward Seungjin: Wow, so you got a call from Jaeseung?)

851
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,730
(Awkward Seungjin: Okay, it's a secret.)
Okay, it's a secret.

852
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:46,220
(Awkward Seungjin: Okay, it's a secret.)

853
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,270
(Seungjin: I really confirmed it then.)

854
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:52,910
(Seungjin: "Ah, I'm just a cute younger brother to him")

855
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:53,970
was what I thought.
(Seungjin: "Ah, I'm just a cute younger brother to him")

856
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:55,560
(Seungjin: "Ah, I'm just a cute younger brother to him")

857
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,660
(Hwi: Then, can I ask?)

858
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:57,820
-Is it the same person as yesterday? -No.
(Hwi: Then, can I ask?)

859
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,380
(Hwi: Is it the same person as yesterday? -Youngjoon: No.)
-Is it the same person as yesterday? -No.

860
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,210
(Hwi: Is it the same person as yesterday? -Youngjoon: No.)

861
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:03,130
(Hwi: Who did you call yesterday?)

862
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:05,990
(Youngjoon: Yesterday's call didn't have much meaning so I'll tell you guys.)

863
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:09,930
(Youngjoon: Yesterday I chose someone I haven't talked to much)

864
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,770
(Youngjoon: and I just told him that I hope we can be friends.)

865
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:11,830
-I was choosing between Seongmin... -Ah, right, right.
(Youngjoon: and I just told him that I hope we can be friends.)

866
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:14,400
(Youngjoon: I was choosing between Seongmin and Jaeseung)
-I was choosing between Seongmin... -Ah, right, right.

867
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,290
-and Jaeseung. -Right, right.
(Youngjoon: I was choosing between Seongmin and Jaeseung)

868
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:18,510
I was hesitating for a bit
(Youngjoon: I was choosing between Seongmin and Jaeseung)

869
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:19,020
-then I called Seongmin. -Yeah...
(Youngjoon: I was choosing between Seongmin and Jaeseung)

870
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,740
(Youngjoon: then I called Seongmin. -Hwi: Yeah...)
-then I called Seongmin. -Yeah...

871
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:21,860
(Youngjoon: then I called Seongmin. -Hwi: Yeah...)

872
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:24,370
(Nodding - Hwi: I got a call from Jaeseung yesterday... -Youngjoon: He called you?)
-I got a call from Jaeseung yesterday... -He called you?

873
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:25,380
Yeah.
(Nodding - Hwi: I got a call from Jaeseung yesterday... -Youngjoon: He called you?)

874
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,200
(Nodding - Hwi: I got a call from Jaeseung yesterday... -Youngjoon: He called you?)

875
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,960
(Youngjoon: Oh~ you got a call from the popular guy.)

876
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:30,720
I think it's gotten complicated.

877
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,810
(Youngjoon: I think it's gotten complicated.)
I think it's gotten complicated.

878
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:33,140
I guess you weren't expecting that.
(Youngjoon: I think it's gotten complicated.)

879
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:33,290
Oh? So you got a call from Jaeseung?

880
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:34,370
(A little strange.)
(Youngjoon: You got a call from Jaeseung?)
Oh? So you got a call from Jaeseung?

881
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:35,040
(A little strange.)
(Youngjoon: You got a call from Jaeseung?)

882
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,180
This is a bit...
(A little strange.)
(Youngjoon: You got a call from Jaeseung?)

883
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,750
(Youngjoon: You got a call from Jaeseung?)

884
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:42,390
(Youngjoon: Oh? From what I heard, that's not true.)

885
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:44,890
(Hwi: Really?)

886
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:46,740
(Youngjoon: Did Jaeseung say his name? -Hwi: Yeah.)

887
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,420
(Hwi: I kept asking him.)

888
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,100
(Youngjoon: Then he told you?)

889
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:55,050
(Hwi: Did other people get a call, too?)

890
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:56,880
(Hwi: Did you get it?)

891
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:58,860
(Youngjoon: It wasn't me and it's not my story)

892
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,510
(Youngjoon: so I don't think I can talk about it.)

893
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,380
(Hwi: What's going on?)

894
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:06,020
(Youngjoon: Then that means someone misunderstood.)

895
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:11,250
(Youngjoon: Minseon said that he talked to Jaeseung on the phone)

896
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,960
(Youngjoon: so I thought, "I see".)

897
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:17,160
(But I guess someone just misunderstood.)

898
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:19,860
(Youngjoon, please come to the phone booth and call someone you like within 30 seconds.)

899
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,470
Anyways...
(Youngjoon, please come to the phone booth and call someone you like within 30 seconds.)

900
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:22,880
(Youngjoon, please come to the phone booth and call someone you like within 30 seconds.)

901
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,330
(Youngjoon: I'll be right back.)

902
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:31,490
(Youngjoon leaves to make a call with a nervous expression.)

903
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:34,470
Can I ask who you called?

904
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:35,960
(Hwi: Can I ask who you called? -Hanmin: Me?)
Can I ask who you called?

905
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,260
-Me? -Yeah
(Hwi: Can I ask who you called? -Hanmin: Me?)

906
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:40,390
(Hanmin: Who do you think I called?)

907
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,590
(Hwi: I'm guessing... Jaeseung?)

908
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:46,750
(Hmm)

909
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,450
(Hwi: Right? -Hanmin: Wrong.)

910
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:49,760
(Hwi: It's not him? -Hanmin: Yeah.)

911
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,330
(Hwi: Ah, then who is it?)

912
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,470
(Youngjoon?)

913
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,400
(Hwi: Right? -Hanmin: Yeah.)

914
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,580
(Excited for him)

915
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:05,540
(Ahhh~ -Hanmin: That's why I like it more.)

916
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:11,070
(Wow, I'm so excited.)

917
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:12,760
(Hwi: I hope you get Youngjoon's call.)

918
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,580
(Hanmin: His call? Sigh...)

919
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,750
(Hanmin: In my opinion...)

920
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:22,560
(Hwi: Judging from the atmosphere, I think you'll get the call.)

921
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:27,780
(The phone is ringing.)

922
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,150
(Hanmin: Hello?)

923
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,340
(Youngjoon: Hello? -Hanmin: Hello?)

924
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:39,390
(Screaming)

925
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:47,990
(Youngjoon: I don't know what to say. My mind went blank.)

926
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:51,110
(Hanmin: If you don't know what to say then come back and see me.)

927
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:52,420
(Hanmin: Hurry and come back.)

928
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:59,850
(Youngjoon: I was really happy when I got your call earlier.)

929
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:02,480
(Hanmin: Really? That's a relief.)

930
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,710
(Hanmin: I'm in a good mood right now, too.)

931
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:10,400
(Watching someone else's love story in a first row seat.)

932
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:14,720
(Youngjoon: Um... when I first met you...)

933
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,710
(Youngjoon: Ah, it ended.)

934
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:20,140
(Thirty seconds passed.)

935
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:23,680
(Shy)

936
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,930
(Did he hang up?)

937
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:27,540
(One call makes their hearts flutter.)

938
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,790
I knew he'd call you.
(One call makes their hearts flutter.)

939
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:30,200
(One call makes their hearts flutter.)

940
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:31,150
It stopped halfway.

941
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,420
(Hanmin: It stopped halfway.)
It stopped halfway.

942
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:35,130
(Hanmin: It stopped halfway.)

943
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:48,160
(A suspicious ring coming from the phone booth.)

944
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:50,990
(Startled Youngjoon: Hello..?)

945
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:52,050
Hello..?
(Startled Youngjoon: Hello..?)

946
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:52,810
(Startled Youngjoon: Hello..?)

947
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,700
Hello, Youngjoon.

948
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,610
(This is an introduction to a secret mission.)

949
00:48:56,610 --> 00:49:03,860
(Among the six men who moved in first, we are only giving Youngjoon, who got a call from a new man, a chance to give another call.)

950
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:07,760
But you can't call the man you've called before.

951
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:11,430
(You can't let anyone know about this mission.)

952
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:15,100
(Youngjoon: Gosh...)

953
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,850
(Youngjoon gets another chance to call.)

954
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:19,090
Gosh...
(Youngjoon gets another chance to call.)

955
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,120
(Youngjoon looks flustered.)

956
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:27,140
(Youngjoon: It was really pointless)

957
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,550
(Youngjoon: to give me another chance to call.)

958
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:33,940
(Youngjoon: I thought a lot about how to turn something useless)

959
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:39,040
(Youngjoon: into something useful.)

960
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:43,880
(Gaining another chance, Youngjoon thinks about it carefully.)

961
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:52,410
(Who will be the second man Youngjoon expresses his feelings to?)

962
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:59,620
(Picks up the phone difficultly.)

963
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:07,700
(Does he call Seongmin like he did yesterday?)

964
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:11,770
(Does he call Seongmin like he did yesterday? Is it Myeongkyun, his fate in the past?)

965
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,090
(Jaeseung: Hello?)

966
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:26,120
("Brother")

967
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,580
(Jaeseung: Who is this?)

968
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,710
(Youngjoon: I'm someone who calls you "brother" the most.)

969
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:33,850
(Jaeseung: Ah, what is this...)

970
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:39,400
(Youngjoon: I feel like I've become a character who likes to tease people. -Jaeseung: Ah, what is this...)

971
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,640
(Youngjoon: I hope you don't misunderstand.)

972
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,890
(Youngjoon: You know right? That I'm showing kindness because I want to be friends with you.)

973
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,110
(Jaeseung: Ah, really? Is that why you called?)

974
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:53,880
(Youngjoon: I was afraid you might be in a bad mood because of me.)

975
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:04,010
(Youngjoon hangs up the phone and comes out peacefully.)

976
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:07,870
(Youngjoon: With Myeongkyun, because I didn't get a call from him today)

977
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:11,300
(Youngjoon: so I think I can exclude him)

978
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,560
(Youngjoon: from the possibility of being someone who likes me.)

979
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,600
(Youngjoon: But since this morning)

980
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,720
(Youngjoon: I worked out together with)

981
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:24,450
(Youngjoon: Jaeseung who made me feel comfortable around him so I called him.)

982
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:27,250
(Rather than interest, Youngjoon's call expressed kindness.)

983
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:31,560
(Jaeseung: About Youngjoon... I think he's kind to everyone.)

984
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,560
(Jaeseung: That's how he makes me feel.)

985
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:40,410
(Jaeseung: Someone who is kind to everyone is far from my ideal type.)

986
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:44,040
(Youngjoon: I can't believe it.)

987
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,790
(Youngjoon: I thought about how someone else must've gotten this secret mission as well.)

988
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,950
(Youngjoon: So even though we can't tell and let each other know,)

989
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:54,960
(Youngjoon: I'm pretty sure someone else was in the same situation as me.)

990
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:56,930
("This is fun.")

991
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:58,330
That's what I thought.
("This is fun.")

992
00:51:58,330 --> 00:51:59,800
("This is fun.")

993
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:00,180
I feel like a real brother.

994
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,060
(The three people who finished the call are gathered together.)
I feel like a real brother.

995
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:02,840
(The three people who finished the call are gathered together.)

996
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,570
Who? Who are you talking about?
(The three people who finished the call are gathered together.)

997
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:04,720
(The three people who finished the call are gathered together.)

998
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,380
Jaeseung, I'm talking about Jaeseung.
(The three people who finished the call are gathered together.)

999
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:06,390
Jaeseung, I'm talking about Jaeseung.

1000
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:07,640
Anyway...

1001
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:12,170
(Seungjin: How many calls did you get yesterday? -Seongmin: Me? Two.)

1002
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:15,470
(Seungjin: How many calls did you get yesterday? -Hwi: Two.)

1003
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:16,700
(Seungjin: I didn't receive a single call yesterday.)

1004
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,840
(Seungjin: But I don't think I'll get any today either.)

1005
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,050
-But I... -No.

1006
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,090
(Phone call session has ended)

1007
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:24,360
-I think it's over. -That scared me.
(Phone call session has ended)

1008
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,850
(Phone call session has ended)

1009
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:33,370
Look, look.

1010
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:39,400
(Seongmin is flustered.)

1011
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:44,170
(Seongmin is flustered and Hwi's expression turns dark.)

1012
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:44,450
I thought I'd get a call.

1013
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:47,780
(Hwi: I thought I'd get a call from Seoming)
I thought I'd get a call.

1014
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:51,350
(Hwi: So I've been waiting... But the calling session ended...)

1015
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:56,450
(Hwi: So my thoughts were very complicated.)

1016
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:07,350
(Seongmin: At the time... I felt...)

1017
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:11,840
(Seongmin: It's like I betrayed him.)

1018
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,930
(Seongmin: I didn't know what to do at that time.)

1019
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,770
(Seungjin: This is fun.)

1020
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:22,980
(Seongmin: Today, I called someone I want to get close to.)

1021
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:25,020
(Are Seongmin's words true or are they just excuses for Hwi to hear?)

1022
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,450
-He's not looking at him. -Who else besides Hwi?
(Are Seongmin's words true or are they just excuses for Hwi to hear?)

1023
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:27,440
What about Seungjin?
(Are Seongmin's words true or are they just excuses for Hwi to hear?)

1024
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,590
-Do you want to go for a smoke? -Oh, sure.

1025
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:29,380
(Seungjin: Oh, sure.)
-Do you want to go for a smoke? -Oh, sure.

1026
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:29,970
(Seungjin: Oh, sure.)

1027
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:32,080
(Hwi: I'll be right back.)

1028
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,870
(Hwi and Seungjin get up and leave.)

1029
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:37,920
Wait for us.
(Hwi and Seungjin get up and leave.)

1030
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,320
Okay, come back soon.
(Hwi and Seungjin get up and leave.)

1031
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,430
(Hwi and Seungjin get up and leave.)

1032
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:46,890
(Seongmin looks troubled.)

1033
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,430
(Seongmin: After the phone session ended, I've been avoiding Hwi.)

1034
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:53,540
(Seongmin: I don't even look at him.)

1035
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:00,540
(Eight men's unpredictable hearts.)

1036
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,260
(The second phone session is over.)

1037
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,370
(Someone is feeling complicated.)

1038
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:08,170
-I have a lot on my mind now. -Why?
(Someone is feeling complicated.)

1039
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:10,670
(Someone is feeling complicated.)

1040
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:14,490
(Hwi: I don't know.)

1041
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:16,620
(Seungjin: Did you get a call today? -Hwi: No, I didn't.)

1042
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,850
(Seungjin: Really? I haven't gotten a call in two days in a row.)

1043
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:24,160
(It would be a tragedy if I break the record of three days.)

1044
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:29,540
(Hwi: Even when we were all sitting together in the entertainment room)

1045
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,050
(Hwi: I couldn't control my facial expression...)

1046
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,980
(Seungjin: Really? -Hwi: Yeah.)

1047
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:36,010
(Hwi: It was really hard.)

1048
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:42,290
(Seongmin's heart is heavy due to Hwi's apology.)

1049
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:43,300
Gosh.

1050
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:44,260
Oh.

1051
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:44,930
(Come on...)
Oh.

1052
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:46,820
(Come on...)

1053
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:49,430
(Seongmin: Where is Hwi?)

1054
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:52,800
(Seungjin: I don't know. Maybe he went to the bathroom? Where did he go?)

1055
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:52,820
(Worried Seongmin: Hwi must be really disappointed.)

1056
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:54,680
Hwi must be really disappointed.
(Worried Seongmin: Hwi must be really disappointed.)

1057
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,320
(Worried Seongmin: Hwi must be really disappointed.)

1058
00:54:57,850 --> 00:54:59,040
(Seongmin: I'm nothing...)

1059
00:54:59,040 --> 00:54:59,490
I'm nothing...
(Seongmin: I'm nothing...)

1060
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:00,600
(Hey~)
I'm nothing...

1061
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,350
(No, no, no, no, no.)

1062
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:06,530
(Seungjin: Once you start thinking like this, there's no end to it.)

1063
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,080
(Seongmin's still upset after Seungjin's comfort.)

1064
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:12,450
(Hwi, heading to the third floor alone)

1065
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:15,250
Once I knew the call session was over,
(Hwi, heading to the third floor alone)

1066
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:16,760
(Hwi, heading to the third floor alone)

1067
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,310
(Hwi: I didn’t show it,)

1068
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:21,290
(Hwi: but I couldn’t control my facial expressions)

1069
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:24,950
(Hwi: so I came to the third floor alone for a bit.)

1070
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:28,490
(Hwi: If I show my emotions on my face, I'd feel sorry)

1071
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:32,060
(Hwi: so I went to calm myself down for a while.)

1072
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,730
(Jaeseung and Myeongkyun arrive in the kitchen)

1073
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:36,820
(Myeongkyun: When should we wake up tomorrow morning)

1074
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:38,650
(Myeongkyun: if we're making croffles?)

1075
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,190
(Myeongkyun: What do you need me to help with?)

1076
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:45,060
(Jaeseung: Just help me make a salad tomorrow. -Myeongkyun: A salad?)

1077
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,010
(Jaeseung and Myeongkyun preparing for tomorrow's breakfast in advance.)

1078
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:47,960
Is it this one?
(Jaeseung and Myeongkyun preparing for tomorrow's breakfast in advance.)

1079
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:52,070
(Jaeseung and Myeongkyun preparing for tomorrow's breakfast in advance.)

1080
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,800
(Croissant dough)

1081
00:55:54,800 --> 00:56:00,720
(Myeongkyun: Should I do a headcount? The number of people?)

1082
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:07,650
(Jaeseung: Try it as a sandwich and if it's good)

1083
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:08,990
(Jaeseung: I'll make you a normal croffle if you want.)

1084
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:10,990
(Minseon: Really? That's great.)

1085
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:13,600
-It can be a late-night snack. -Looks like we've gotten close.
(Minseon: Really? That's great.)

1086
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,210
-It can be a late-night snack. -Looks like we've gotten close.

1087
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:18,410
(Minseon: What goes inside a croffle sandwich?)

1088
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,550
(After a storm-like day...)

1089
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:23,870
(Hanmin, Youngjoon, Myeongkyun are ready to sleep, and Minseon is in the shower.)

1090
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:27,140
(Hanmin: What time should we wake up at? -Youngjoon: I need to get up at 7:30 AM.)

1091
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,880
(Youngjoon: But I have a lot of time to wake up.)

1092
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,640
(Myeongkyun: I need to help with breakfast tomorrow)

1093
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,890
(Myeongkyun: so I'm getting up at 8:00 AM tomorrow)

1094
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:39,380
(Hanmin: Then I'll wake up around 8:00 AM.)

1095
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:42,830
(Youngjoon: Who's going to wash up first between the two of you?)

1096
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:44,800
(Youngjoon: How long does it take to get ready?)

1097
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:44,900
I get ready really fast.
(Youngjoon: How long does it take to get ready?)

1098
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:48,200
(Myeongkyun: I get ready really fast.)
I get ready really fast.

1099
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,400
(Myeongkyun: I get ready really fast.)

1100
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,690
(Youngjoon: Let's go to sleep.)

1101
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:55,470
(Good night~)

1102
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:59,540
(The four men go to sleep after deciding when to wake up.)

1103
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:04,580
(Hwi stays up and waits for Seongmin.)

1104
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:14,570
(Take a look)

1105
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:19,810
(Seongmin: What time did you set your alarm? -Hwi: Oh, alarm?)

1106
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:19,860
(Hwi: 8:00 AM...)

1107
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,370
8:00 AM...
(Hwi: 8:00 AM...)

1108
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:22,010
(Hwi: 8:00 AM...)

1109
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:24,800
(Hwi: Should I wake up first at 8:00 AM and then wake you up?)

1110
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,220
(Seongmin: Oh, okay.)

1111
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:28,980
(Seongmin: Then can you wake me up at 8:30 AM?)

1112
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,450
(Hwi: Sure, 8:30 AM.)

1113
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:37,720
(After turning off the lights the two become silent.)

1114
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:39,920
Did you guys talk a lot?

1115
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,180
(Seongmin: Did you guys talk a lot?)
Did you guys talk a lot?

1116
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:42,560
(Seongmin: Did you guys talk a lot?)

1117
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:47,930
(Hwi: I got choked up while taking. -Seongmin: Why?)

1118
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:51,500
(Hwi: Because I didn't get your call...)

1119
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,830
(Seongmin: Hey...)

1120
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:58,830
(Seongmin: No, I simply called who I wanted to get close to today.)

1121
00:57:58,830 --> 00:58:04,830
(Hwi: I was just... really worried...)

1122
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:08,860
(Seongmin: I decided from the start that on the first and second day)

1123
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,420
(Seongmin: I'm going to call different people.)

1124
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:13,920
(Hwi: Ah...)

1125
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,970
(Seongmin: Even before I came here)

1126
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:21,760
(Seongmin: I decided that I wanted to get to know a lot of people.)

1127
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,660
(Seongmin: I actually thought you'd call someone else.)

1128
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:24,430
As soon as I entered...
(Seongmin: I actually thought you'd call someone else.)

1129
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:27,760
(Hwi: As soon as I entered the phone booth)
As soon as I entered...

1130
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,170
(Hwi: As soon as I entered the phone booth)

1131
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:28,550
I pressed the button right after I found your name.
(Hwi: As soon as I entered the phone booth)

1132
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:30,700
(Hwi: I pressed the button right after I found your name.)
I pressed the button right after I found your name.

1133
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,260
(Hwi: I pressed the button right after I found your name.)

1134
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,730
(Seongmin: Hey... I'm really sorry...)

1135
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:34,790
(Hwi: No! No!)

1136
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:37,960
(Hwi: There’s nothing to be sorry about.)

1137
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,220
(Hwi: I chose you because)

1138
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:40,730
(I thought about you all day today)

1139
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:47,590
I couldn't think about anyone else.
(I thought about you all day today)

1140
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:49,900
(I thought about you all day today)

1141
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:53,020
(Hwi: But I'm glad. It's not like that.)

1142
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:55,630
(Seongmin: What? -Hwi: Like...)

1143
00:58:55,630 --> 00:59:00,170
(because the interest level... is the same...)

1144
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:01,880
(Seongmin: Don't worry.)

1145
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,250
(Hwi: Ah, I'm not going to worry anymore!)

1146
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,040
(Seongmin: But I'm really grateful.)

1147
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:09,150
(Seongmin: Thank you for thinking so nicely of me.)

1148
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:11,530
(Seongmin: How can you say that even after seeing my bare face...)

1149
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:14,560
(Hwi: Why? -Seongmin: How can you say that?)

1150
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,760
("You're really handsome.")

1151
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,940
(Hwi: Seriously.)

1152
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,500
(Seongmin: What are you talking about~~)

1153
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:24,680
(Hwi: It's true.)

1154
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:29,330
(Seongmin: From the start to the end,)

1155
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:31,330
(Seongmin: honestly out of all eight people,)

1156
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:34,860
("you have my ideal type of personality.")

1157
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:36,760
-Really? -Yeah.
("you have my ideal type of personality.")

1158
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:45,420
("I think my ideal type just got confirmed.")

1159
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:45,440
Hey~
("I think my ideal type just got confirmed.")

1160
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,610
Hey~

1161
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:52,320
(This person is probably shy, too.)

1162
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:56,850
(Seongmin: But we really should go to sleep now. Let's go to sleep. -Hwi: Yeah, we really should sleep.)

1163
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:02,600
("Good night.")

1164
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:05,550
While we were on the phone, you answered a phone call.

1165
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:06,540
(Youngjoon: You answered a phone call.)
While we were on the phone, you answered a phone call.

1166
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:07,630
Yeah.
(Youngjoon: You answered a phone call.)

1167
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:08,230
You said you could guess who it was, right?

1168
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:09,200
(He seems to care about Hanmin's phone call from the other day.)
You said you could guess who it was, right?

1169
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,110
Yeah.

1170
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:10,790
(He seems to care about Hanmin's phone call from the other day.)

1171
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:13,660
("I think it's Myeongkyun.")

1172
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:16,210
(Oh... Myeongkyun again?)

1173
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:19,880
(Currently, whenever I hear the word Myeongkyun)

1174
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:20,510
I feel really uncomfortable.
(Currently, whenever I hear the word Myeongkyun)

1175
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:22,070
(That man's name makes me uncomfortable.)
I feel really uncomfortable.

1176
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:24,590
(That man's name makes me uncomfortable.)

1177
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:28,710
(At the time I thought, "oh? It's not like I cheated.")

1178
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:28,840
I felt a little bit of pressure.
(At the time I thought, "oh? It's not like I cheated.")

1179
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:29,090
I felt a little bit of pressure.

1180
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:31,530
(Men's hearts, unsure of where they are headed.)
I felt a little bit of pressure.

1181
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:32,800
(Men's hearts, unsure of where they are headed.)

1182
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,750
(Jaeseung: Oh, I'm falling into the water.)

1183
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:37,000
(Hwi: I’m a little surprised, but really happy.)

1184
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,010
I felt a bit excited.
(Hwi: I’m a little surprised, but really happy.)

1185
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:38,530
(The beginning of another love line?)
I felt a bit excited.

1186
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:40,600
I just thought he was cute.
(The beginning of another love line?)

1187
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:43,860
(At that moment I didn't know if I actually liked Hwi.)

1188
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:45,850
(Jaeseung: I just thought he was cute.)

1189
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:48,290
(Hwi: I'm curious about something. -Jaeseung: What?)

1190
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:51,410
(Hwi: I want to know if your interest level towards me has changed.)

1191
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:54,380
("I liked it when you smiled.")

1192
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,390
I did feel a bit excited.
("I liked it when you smiled.")

1193
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:55,590
I did feel a bit excited.

1194
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:56,970
(Their sincere feelings are exposed to each other.)
I did feel a bit excited.

1195
01:00:56,970 --> 01:00:58,450
(Their sincere feelings are exposed to each other.)

1196
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:00,310
(Hwi: I should...)

1197
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:02,700
("Make it more clear.")
