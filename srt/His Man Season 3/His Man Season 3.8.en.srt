00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,780
(Minseon: they wanted answers to their doubts immediately.)

268
00:14:41,780 --> 00:15:01,980
(Why are you like this: If you're hiding from him, why do you keep getting closer with him?
Jo Myeongkyun: Because I know that's not what he's like.
Jo Myeongkyun: Why is he acting like that?
Why are you like this: Do you think he's hiding the real him from other people?)

269
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:06,500
(Myeongkyun: He's not how I know him.)

270
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:12,900
(Myeongkyun: Rather than him being not cheerful, he's just not someone like this normally.)

271
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:21,730
(Why are you like this: Do you think he's hiding his true self from others?
Jo Myeongkyun: He'll deny it.
Jo Myungkyun: He must be mad heh.)

272
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,040
Crazy jerk.
(Why are you like this: Do you think he's hiding his true self from others?
Jo Myeongkyun: He'll deny it.
Jo Myungkyun: He must be mad heh.)

273
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,580

Jo Myeongkyun: He will deny it.
Jo Myungkyun: He must be mad heh.
Mingcheon: Mm... I came in to chat but it feels like I'm looking at other people chat.)
(Freeze)

276
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,820
(Minseon: I was a bit disappointed.)

277
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:42,890
(Minseon: Because I came to Myeongkyun's chat group because I wanted to talk.)

278
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:47,340
Because I came to Myeongkyun's chat group because I wanted to talk.
(Minseon: Because I came to Myeongkyun's chat group because I wanted to talk.)

279
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:47,370
(Minseon: In the end, I could only look at them talking.)
Because I came to Myeongkyun's chat group because I wanted to talk.
(Minseon: Because I came to Myeongkyun's chat group because I wanted to talk.)

280
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,860
(Minseon: In the end, I could only look at them talking.)

281
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,420
(Minseon: I started to think too much.)

282
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,750
(Mingcheon: Mm... I came in to chat but it feels like I'm looking at other people chat.)
(Youngjoon: I felt a little conscious of it, and felt sorry.)

(Myeongkyun: Cause he's talking to me without the filter.)

294

(Jo Myeongkyun: Cause we had a comfortable relationship.
Why are you like this: I don't think so.
Why are you like this: I heard you didn't really contact each other.
Jo Myeongkyun: We just contacted each other time to time. It just felt like he didn't really need me.
Why are you like this: Could it be you're the only one who felt like your relationship was comfortable?)

(Myeongkyun: But he keeps thinking it wasn't dating,)

303

(Youngjoon: Rather than answers that I got for the questions I asked,)

307
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:50,740
(Youngjoon: I got more ridiculous answers that sound more ambiguous to others.)

Seungjin: I did.)

Seungmin: 12 years.)

(Jaeseung: With the love triangle Seongmin, Hwi, and I have,)

411
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:44,740

427
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,620
(Hanmin: He cried once in the morning too.)

Wait.

432
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,900
(Seongmin: Though it's conflicting, honestly, I wish Hwi can go mingle with other people,)

433

(Jaeseung: I saw Seongmin cry today)

(-Seungjin: Are you done? -Hwi: I sent a lot of emojis.)

792
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:08,140
(-Seungjin: Are you only in one chatroom right now? The one with Seungmin? -Hwi: Yeah.)

00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:08,190
(Seungjin: Is the chat)

794

(Hwi: I only ever talked to Seongmin)

(Hwi: we never texted each other before)

804
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:26,420

(Jaeseung: I organized my feelings for Seongmin at the time.)

807

I organized my feelings.

810
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:48,940
(Seongmin: I've changed a lot inside after the anonymous chat.)

811
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:53,420
(Seongmin: I think the afterwaves were quite strong.)

812

(Hanmin: During the anonymous chat, I could see if the person I like)

813
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,140
(Hanmin: had feelings for others)

814
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:10,180
(Hanmin: so it felt like I was peeping.)

815
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:16,620
(How did the anonymous chat change the men?)

816
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:27,340
(Jaeseung is in deep thoughts alone)

817
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:32,100
(Sighing)

818
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,580
(Knock knock)

819

(Hanmin: Are you still alive?)

820
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:54,580
(Hanmin: Why are you so dead?)

821
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,020
What’s wrong?

822
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:55,830
(Thank you. *Hanmin gives Jaeseung ice cream*)
What’s wrong?

823
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:56,590
(Thank you. *Hanmin gives Jaeseung ice cream*)

824
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:57,750
Thank you.

(Thank you. *Hanmin gives Jaeseung ice cream*)

826
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:07,940
(Hanmin: You look confused.)

827
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:13,260
(Hanmin: Since Seongmin and I are roommates I was right next to him.)

828
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,780
(Hanmin: So I think Jaeseung's thoughts must be complicated.)

829
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:16,070
(Hanmin: Both Seongmin and Jaeseung.)

830
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:18,260
Both Seongmin and Jaeseung.
(Hanmin: Both Seongmin and Jaeseung.)

831

(Hanmin: Both Seongmin and Jaeseung.)

832
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:25,220
(Hanmin: I'm always with Younjoon.)

833
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:31,020
(Hanmin: Hwi and Seunjin are also always together because they're young.)

834
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:35,860
(Hanmin: Myeongkyun and Minseon are together.)

835
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:39,860
(Hanmin: So I feel like Jaeeung and Seongmin)

836
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:43,020
(Hanmin: doesn't have someone they can talk to.)

837
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:48,180
(Hanmin: I thought Jaeseung must be worrying by himself)

838
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:50,860
(Hanmin: so I wanted to listen to him.)

839
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:59,220
(Jaeseung: But like earlier in the chatroom...)

840
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:05,620
(Jaeseung: I really don't have the confidence to experience the same thing again.)

841
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:11,700
(Jaeseung: I really... feel...)

842
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:18,940
(it really feels like my heart is being ripped apart.)

843
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:19,500
(-Jaeseung: Do you know the content of Seongmin's anonymous chat group? -Hanmin: No, I don't.)

-No, I don't. -You don't know, right?
(-Jaeseung: Do you know the content of Seongmin's anonymous chat group? -Hanmin: No, I don't.)

But...
(-Jaeseung: Do you know the content of Seongmin's anonymous chat group? -Hanmin: No, I don't.)

847
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:24,300
But seeing that...

848
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,730
(Jaeseung: But seeing that in Seongmin's anonymous chat, I left after 2 minutes.)

(Jaeseung: I know that Seongmin is interested in Hwi.)

857
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,460
(Jaeseung: He might have feelings for me, too.)

858
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:49,940
(Jaeseung: Seongmin seems to like two people.)

859

(Jaeseung: If I say I only have feelings for one person,)

860

(-Jaeseung: I'm worried that Seongmin would feel burdened. -Hanmin: I see...)

861

(-Jaeseung: I also feel sorry that Seongmin would have to worry about that. -Hanmin: Yeah.)

(Jaeseung: That's why I don't really like Hwi right now.)
Yeah.

(Jaeseung: I'm in a very tormented state)

869
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:35,300
(Jaeseung: but Hanmin came over and gave me a lot of advice.)

(Youngjoon: I really don't know what you're talking about.)

887
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:13,900
(Youngjoon: I don't know what you think I'm hiding.)

888
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,500
(Myeongkyun: Oh... But if I tell you, it won't do me any good.)

889
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,660
(Myeongkyun: It won't do me any good so I don't want to say it.)

890
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:19,900
(-Youngjoon: Why won't it? -Myeongkyun: I don't want to tell you.)

891
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,230
I don't want to tell you.
(-Youngjoon: Why won't it? -Myeongkyun: I don't want to tell you.)

892
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:25,660
(-Youngjoon: It'd be bad for you if you told me? -Myeongkyun: Yeah, just do what you want.)

893
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:28,220
(-Youngjoon: But it's my secret. -Myeongkyun: Yeah, just do what you want.)

894
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:34,420
(Myeongkyun: Just keep doing what you're doing.)

895
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:38,020
(Youngjoon: No, I don't have a secret.)

896
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:40,900
(Myeongkyun: This is interesting.)

897
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,660
(Myeongkyun: He suddenly came over and got mad at me.)

898
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,500
(Myeongkyun: I was really upset.)

899
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:50,900
(-Youngjoon: If you do this, my image will be ruined. -Myeongkyun: Okay.)

900
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,180
(-Youngjoon: Is that what you're trying to do? You want to make me the bad person? -Myeongkyu: No.)

901
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:57,300
(-Youngjoon: Then why? -Myeongkyun: Just do what you want~ Why?)

902
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,220
(Youngjoon: No, I told you I have no secrets.)

903
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:01,620
(Youngjoon: But if you're like this, it's like as if there is something.)

904
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:05,780
(Youngjoon: People will also misunderstand if you keep saying, 'just do what you want'.)

905
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:08,500
(Youngjoon: I'm asking because I really don't know.)

906
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,780
(Youngjoon: So you want them to decide on their own?)

907
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,700
(Youngjoon: Let them think that you're talking nonsense)

908
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:19,140
(-Youngjoon: or make them think that I'm hiding something? You want everyone to just think what they want? -Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

909
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:25,660
(-Youngjoon: You keep telling me to do what I want, then why didn't you leave me alone earlier? -Myeongkyun: I didn't do anything.)

910
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,500
(Youngjoon: You're saying you didn't do anything? -Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

911
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:35,340
(Youngjoon: That weird, anonymous message. Anyone can tell that you're the one who wrote it. What was that? -Myeongkyun: What did I write?)

912
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:47,300
(Youngjoon: What do you want from me?)

913
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:50,860
(Myeongkyun: Did I pick a fight with him or something?)

914
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:52,020
(Youngjoon: What do you want from me?)

915
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:56,260
(Youngjoon: Or how do you feel about me?)

916
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:03,140
(-Youngjoon: I don't know. I don't know how I should treat you anymore. -Myeongkyun: You don't have to do anything for me.)

917
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,980
(Myeongkyun: If you're curious, you don't have to do anything.)

918
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:10,260
(Youngjoon: No, you keep stressing me out.)

919
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,420
(Youngjoon: I don't know what you're trying to do.)

920
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:16,900
(Youngjoon: Are you trying to tell me you like me?)

921
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:20,020
(Youngjoon: Or are you trying to tell me you don't like me? I don't know.)

922
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:22,140
(Youngjoon: If you tell me, then I can)

923
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:25,340
(Youngjoon: properly give you a response and tell you what I think.)

924
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:27,900
(Myeongkyun: I don't need to know. Just do what you feel like.)

925
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,380
(Youngjoon: No, I'm saying I want to do this not that I don't need to know.)

926
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:33,780
(Myeongkyun: You were never like this. Why are you trying to...)

927
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:37,900
(Myeongkyun: Like what about the situation? Have you always thought so deeply?)

928
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,460
(Youngjoon: Then just leave me alone!)

929
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:44,460
(-Myeongkyun: I did. -Youngjoon: No, you never did.)

930
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:48,220
(Myeongkyun: When did I not leave you alone?)

931
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:51,140
(Youngjoon: Ah, I really can't talk with you.)

932
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,660
(Laughing)

933
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:54,940
(Youngjoon: What I feel is that)

934
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:58,060
(Youngjoon: you're like a crazy person who's trying to destroy my image.)

935
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:02,300
(Myeongkyun: Really? Why?)

936
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:07,940
(Youngjoon: No matter what I do, you always follow along and talk nonsense.)

937
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:12,340
(Youngjoon: But if that isn't because you like me,)

938
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,940
(Youngjoon: then it means you just want to see me suffer, right?)

939
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:16,660
(Youngjoon: Isn't it this or that?)

940
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:21,540
(Youngjoon: But you never properly expressed anything to me before.)

941
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:25,020
(Youngjoon: You just told me to think on my own. I'm so confused.)

942
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:28,540
(Youngjoon: I'm stressed out because I don't understand.)

943
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:33,420
(-Youngjoon: But if you tell me, I can come to a conclusion as to what we are. -Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

944
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:37,020
(Young-joon) So what do you want?

945
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:39,180
(Myeongkyun: I don't want to tell you.)

946
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,180
(Ha)

947
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,780
(Myeongkyun: Why? Why are you asking this?)

948
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:48,340
(Youngjoon: Because everything you're doing right now is pissing me off!)

949
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:52,260
(Myeongkyun: You won't understand even if I told you. Even if I express it, you don't understand.)

950
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:55,620
(-Youngjoon: It doesn't matter if I can understand or not, just tell me! -Myeongkyun: No.)

951
01:00:56,500 --> 01:01:02,140
(-Myeongkyun: I don't want to tell you. -Youngjoon: I don't know because you won't tell me properly!)

952
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,880
(Youngjoon is frustrated by the situation and Myeongkyun is alarmed by Youngjoon's attitude)

953
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,800
Really?
(Youngjoon is frustrated by the situation and Myeongkyun is alarmed by Youngjoon's attitude)

954
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,780
(Youngjoon is frustrated by the situation and Myeongkyun is alarmed by Youngjoon's attitude)

955
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:12,460
(-Youngjoon: Just tell me! -Myeongkyun: No, I told you I don't want to. Why do you keep...)

956
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,500
(-Youngjoon: Why? Because it won't do you any good? -Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

957
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:19,500
(-Youngjoon: Why won't it do you any good? Is it your weakness? -Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

958
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,260
(-Youngjoon: Is that not my weakness? -Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

959
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:24,220
(Youngjoon: Why is that your weakness?)

960
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,180
(-Myeongkyun: Why are you asking? -Youngjoon: So it's a weakness towards your image?)

961
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:32,220
(-Youngjoon: Or is it a weakness towards our relationship? -Myeongkyun: Both. It applies to everything that's why I don't want to tell you.)

962
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:35,660
(Myeongkyun: We'll meet up and talk on the phone...)

963
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:38,100
(Myeongkyun: Then one day he will suddenly lose contact.)

964
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:48,260
(Myeongkyun: "Why won't you contact me?", "Are you busy?", "Do you not like me?", "What are you doing?")

965
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,740
(Myeongkyun: He'll read it but won't reply.)

966
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:54,340
(Myeongkyun: So I feel used.)

967
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:57,860
(Myeongkyun: Because I thought my feelings with Youngjoon were mutual.)

968
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:59,900
(Myeongkyun: I thought, 'at least we are both interested in each other'.)

969
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:02,780
(Youngjoon: Then can I go and say whatever I want?)

970
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:04,340
(Youngjoon: Including my relationship with you?)

971
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:05,180
(Myeongkyun: Do what you want~)

972
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:06,340
(-Youngjoon: You don't mind, right? -Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

973
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:08,420
(Youngjoon: You said "OK" right?)

974
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:13,300
(Youngjoon: Then I'm going to tell everyone everything based on facts, okay?)

975
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:20,260
(On the other side, Seongmin overhears the conversation between Myeongkyun and Youngjoon)

976
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:22,100
If you don't know anything, go talk to him. What is he doing?
(On the other side, Seongmin overhears the conversation between Myeongkyun and Youngjoon)

977

978
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:25,060
(Seongmin: What's going on outside?)

979
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:26,540
(-Seongmin: They're talking... -Seungjin: What?)

980
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:28,810
(Seongmin: They're talking... right?)

981
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:29,340
What's wrong?
(Seongmin: They're talking... right?)

982
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:30,020
What's wrong?

983
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:30,290
(The men want to see what's going on)
What's wrong?

984
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:34,340
(The men want to see what's going on)

985
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:43,300
Then I'll tell everyone my relationship with you.

986
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:46,700
(Hwi: Youngjoon told Myeonkyun)

987
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:50,620
(Hwi: "Then I'll tell everyone that we did this, this, and that.")

988
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:51,660
(Hwi: Since he's talking like this)

989
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:56,540
(Hwi: I thought, 'so something is going on' 'this will be fun'.)

990
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:59,260
(Seongmin: What is going on...

991
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:03,420
(Seongmin: Since they're here at Men's House, they should have a good time. What are they doing?)

992
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:05,740
(Seongmin: 'What should I do?' was what I thought.)

993
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:06,300
Something must have happened between the two of them.

994
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:11,980
(Minseon: Something must have happened between Youngjoon and Myeongkyun.)
Something must have happened between the two of them.

995
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:15,260
(Minseon: I feel like it's meaningless to hear it)

996
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:18,820
(Minseon: so I thought I should avoid that place.)

997
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:21,140
(Minseon: That's what I thought.)

998
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:23,780
(-Myeongkyun: Does this stress you out this much? -Youngjoon: Yes.)

999
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:27,060
(-Myeongkyun: Why? -Youngjoon: Because I don't know what you're trying to do.)

1000
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:30,300
(Youngjoon: But I can't even have a proper conversation with you.)

1001
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:34,540
(Myeongkyun: Where was I again? Wait.)

1002
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:39,860
(Youngjoon: I don't want to be so sensitive either.)

1003
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:41,700
(Youngjoon: Why did he say that?)

1004
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:43,740
(Youngjoon: That's all I wanted to know.)

1005
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:48,100
(-Youngjoon: I'm just trying to have a conversation to make things easier. -Myeongkyun: Okay.)

1006
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:51,780
(Youngjoon: Or else let's not care about each other.)

1007
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:55,220
(Youngjoon: I just want to restart and...)

1008
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:56,980
(Youngjoon: Tomorrow, it's not like this can end right now, right?)

1009
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,780
(Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

1010
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:04,740
(Youngjoon: But you keep saying "I just don't want to", "I don't want to", "I don't want to tell you")

1011
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:07,100
(Youngjoon: If that's the case, what do you want me to do?)

1012
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:09,540
(Youngjoon: How are we supposed to spend the rest of our time together?)

1013
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:11,300
(-Youngjoon: We're even in the same room together! -Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

1014

When we are together, it's not just us,

(Hmm~)
When we are together, it's not just us,

1017
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:15,980
but I don't want to affect the other people who are with us.
(Hmm~)

1021
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,620
(Myeongkyun: I'll think about it.)

1022
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:27,460
(Youngjoon: Tell me now.)

1023
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:30,660
(-Myeongkyun: I need some time. -Youngjoon: Why? How long do you need? Till when you go home?)

1024
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:32,060
(Myeongkyun: No, just...)

1025
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:34,980
(Youngjoon: Can you let me know by today? Can I give you about 10 minutes?)

1026

(-Youngjoon: I'll leave during the time being. -Myeongkyun: Wait, don't leave. Let's sort this out.)

(Myeongkyun: It's better if someone is next to me...)

1028
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:47,700
(-Youngjoon: Then I'll come back after getting some water. -Myeongkyun: Go ahead.)

1029
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:53,980
(Myeongkyun: He didn't answer my questions for months,)

1030
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:57,860
(Myeongkyun: yet he wants me to answer his questions within a few seconds.)

1031
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:01,500

(Myeongkyun: When I asked him questions in the past,)

1033
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:11,620
(Myeongkyun: he just kept avoiding it...)

1034
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:15,220
(Myeongkyun: But now...)

1035
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:18,820
(Myeongkyun: It's a bit complicated.)

1036
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:31,300
(Youngjoon comes back after a while.)

1037
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:37,660
(Myeongkyun: If I'm not ENFJ what would I be?)

1038
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:41,740
(E...N)

1039
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,620
(Is it TJ?)

1040
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,940
(Laughing)

1041
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,220
(Youngjoon: What did you say?)

1042
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:51,300
(Myeongkyun: If I'm not ENFJ what would I be?)

1043
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:53,380
(Myeongkyun: I've tested my MBTI many times.)

1044
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:56,740
(Youngjoon: Why? What's wrong with that?)

1045
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:56,920
(Myeongkyun: Because we're (like Youngjoon) both ENFJs.)

1046
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,410
Because we're both ENFJs.
(Myeongkyun: Because we're (like Youngjoon) both ENFJs.)

1047
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:00,940
(Myeongkyun: Because we're (like Youngjoon) both ENFJs.)

1048
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:02,860
(Youngjoon: What does that have to do with now?)

1049
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:07,860
(-Myeongkyun: I just suddenly remembered it while sorting out my thoughts. -Youngjoon: You should sort out your thoughts first.)

1050
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,260
(Myeongkyun: Where should I start?)

1051
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:17,700
(-Youngjoon: Up to you. Just say whatever you want. -Myeongkyun: Up to me?)

1052
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:21,460
(Myeongkyun: Honestly, it's not like we're...)

1053
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:27,180
(Myeongkyun: I don't think we were that intimate.)

1054
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:34,940
(Myeongkyun: I don't think we were in a relationship either, maybe just flirting..?)

1055
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:39,580
(-Myeongkyun: Maybe we were just acquaintances? -Youngjoon: Yeah.)

1056
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,140
(Myeongkyun: Yeah...)

1057
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:48,100
(Myeongkyun: That's it... that's about it.)

1058
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:54,660
(Myeongkyun: At least that was until we completely stopped contacting each other.)

1059
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:58,580
(-Myeongkyun: I still think we are close. -Youngjoon: Okay.)

1060
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:02,620
(Youngjoon: What does being close mean to you?)

1061
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:06,100
(Youngjoon: What did you see us as?)

1062
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:11,060
(Myeongkyun: Up till then... I saw us as people who are close.)

1063
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:13,260
(-Youngjoon: You saw me as someone close? -Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

1064
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:19,060
(-Youngjoon: Is someone close the same as flirting? -Myeongkyun: It's not the same but it felt like you didn't want to talk about it.)

1065
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:22,980
(-Myeongkyun: Usually... -Youngjoon: No, regarding the past, there's nothing I can or can't talk about.)

1066
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:24,580
(Youngjoon: It's just the truth and it's in the past.)

1067
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:31,340
(-Myeongkyun: So usually... if it got to that point... -Youngjoon: Yeah.)

1068
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:34,580
(Myeongkyun: I won't contact anyone else.)

1069
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:38,580
(Myeongkyun: I'll focus completely on who I'm contacting with.)

1070
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:42,020
(-Youngjoon: Were you really focused on me? -Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

1071
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:45,300
(Youngjoon: Since you talked like you don't care, I don't know if you're acting or not.)

1072
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:47,820
(Youngjoon: Also, your actions at the time or)

1073
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:51,260
(Youngjoon: what I felt when we met)

1074
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:54,420
(Youngjoon: you didn't seem like you wanted a relationship.)

1075
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,900
(Youngjoon: My feelings for you also didn't get much stronger.)

1076
01:07:56,900 --> 01:08:01,740
(Youngjoon: It was actually beginning to cool off. That's why it ended like that.)

1077
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:05,620
(Youngjoon: After that, I stopped contacting you as much, right?)

1078
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:09,940
(-Youngjoon: I haven't seen you since then. That was a already few years ago, right? -Myeongkyun: I think it's been over a year.)

1079
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:13,300
(Youngjoon: From what I felt back then, I don't think you were interested in dating.)

1080
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:17,460
(Youngjoon: I think you just saw me as someone you were close with.)

1081
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:22,819
(Youngjoon: But that's not what I wanted, that's why I distanced myself from you.)

1082
01:08:22,819 --> 01:08:24,859
(Youngjoon: It's not that I don't like you)

1083
01:08:24,859 --> 01:08:26,340
(Youngjoon: and it's not like we've gotten into a fight)

1084
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:32,700
(Youngjoon: so I never wanted to block you or cut you off completely.)

1085
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:35,700
(Youngjoon: I just saw you as someone I know.)

1086
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:38,660
(Youngjoon: There's actually no reason to block you)

1087
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:40,660
(Youngjoon: because you're simply just not interested in me anymore.)

1088
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:44,859
(Youngjoon: So that's why I stopped contacting you and things ended like that.)

1089
01:08:44,859 --> 01:08:49,819
(Youngjoon: I wanted to just keep things the way it was.)

1090
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:54,300
(Youngjoon: But then you started contacting me afterwards. Asking me what I'm doing.)

1091
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:58,260
(Youngjoon: You would contact me a few times a month, or once a few months, right?)

1092
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:01,100
(-Youngjoon: But I still responded, right? -Myeongkyun: You don't really respond.)

1093
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,899
(-Youngjoon: I hardly responded, right? -Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

1094
01:09:03,899 --> 01:09:06,500
(Youngjoon: Then why do you think I didn't respond?)

1095
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:07,979
(Myeongkyun: I wanted to confirm it, that's why I messaged you.)

1096
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:08,340
(Confrim what? Whether I blocked you or not?)

1097
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:10,310
(Youngjoon: Confrim what? Whether I blocked you or not?)
(Confrim what? Whether I blocked you or not?)

1098
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:11,060
(Youngjoon: Confrim what? Whether I blocked you or not?)

1099
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:15,540
(-Youngjoon: What did you want to confirm? -Myeongkyun: What I said, I wanted to know how you were doing.)

1100
01:09:15,979 --> 01:09:17,580
(Youngjoon: You wanted to know how I was doing, but if I don't reply)

1101
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:19,140
(Youngjoon: then it means)

1102
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:20,899
(Youngjoon: that I don't want you to know how I'm doing.)

1103
01:09:20,899 --> 01:09:22,779
(Myeongkyun: I thought maybe you were too busy and didn't see.)

1104
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:26,540
(Youngjoon: It doesn't matter if I'm busy or not, it means)

1105
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:29,460
(Youngjoon: that I didn't think it was necessary to reply you.)

1106
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:32,060
(Youngjoon: Then what does that mean? That means I no longer have feelings for you.)

1107
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:36,979
(-Myeongkyun: No, but... -Youngjoon: Then you should know what and stop contacting me.)

1108
01:09:36,979 --> 01:09:39,300
(Youngjoon: But you still continued to contact me.)

1109
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,740
(Youngjoon: So lately, I don't know if you know,)

1110
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:45,100
(-Youngjoon: but a few months ago I unfollowed you on Instagram. -Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

1111
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:48,300
(Youngjoon: But you still look at my Instagram, right?)

1112
01:09:48,939 --> 01:09:52,779
(Youngjoon: During this time I came to Men's House)

1113
01:09:52,779 --> 01:09:55,020
(Youngjoon: and the next day I noticed that you came, too.)

1114
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:58,780
(Youngjoon: So, if you're trying to tell me that you are still interested in me,)

1115
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:01,260
(Youngjoon: then if you show me or tell me)

1116
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:03,380
(Youngjoon: I might think about it.)

1117
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:06,180
(Youngjoon: But if that's not the case.)

1118
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:08,780
(Youngjoon: To be honest, if you just don't like me,)

1119
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:11,140
(Youngjoon: and you think it bothers you to be together with me,)

1120
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,740
(Youngjoon: then I won't care about you at all and you don't have to care about me.)

1121
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:17,180
(-Youngjoon: You can just care about other people. -Myeongkyun: Okay...)

1122
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:21,420
(Youngjoon: But why are you telling others as if I am hiding something?)

1123
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:25,100
(Youngjoon: Like I'm hiding something and pretending to be normal.)

1124
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:28,900
(Youngjoon: Writing weird anonymous notes like that.)

1125
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:30,020
(Youngjoon: Earlier in the anonymous chatroom, too.)

1126
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:34,500
(Youngjoon: Saying things that no one understands.)

1127
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:37,340
(-Youngjoon: What is that? -Myeongkyun: I knew that it was you.)

1128
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:40,020
(-Youngjoon: I'm letting you know. -Myeongkyun: Okay.)

1129
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:44,860
(-Youngjoon: Who doesn't know? You also saw it in Hanmin's chatroom. -Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

1130
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:48,980
(-Youngjoon: Of course I know. Who else will say that besides me? -Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

1131
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:53,180
(Youngjoon: That's why I wanted to talk to you. What are you trying to do?)

1132
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:56,820
(Youngjoon: How should we get along and what should we do with the remaining time?)

1133
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:59,460
(Youngjoon: I want to reach a conclusion with you.)

1134
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:01,900
(Youngjoon: But you won't tell me at all.)

1135
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:04,340
(Yawning) (Youngjoon: When I saw you on the first day,)
-When I saw you on the first day, -Yeah.

1136
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:05,820
(Yawning) (Youngjoon: When I saw you on the first day,)

1137
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:09,460
(Youngjoon: regarding how we know each other and have a past together,)

1138
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:12,660
(Youngjoon: I want to talk about how we'll let the others know and when to tell them.)

1139
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:14,500
(Youngjoon: But you keep avoiding this.)

1140
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,620
(Youngjoon: If I just say things however I want,)

1141
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:20,780
(Youngjoon: what if you accuse me later on for saying the wrong things?)

1142
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:22,540
(Myeongkyun: Actually...)

1143
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:24,580
(Youngjoon: I have nothing to hide! I can say everything!)

1144
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:26,340
(Myeongkyun: Then go ahead.)

1145
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:27,820
(Youngjoon: But I can't just say whatever I want.)

1146
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:30,100
(Youngjoon: I should talk to you first, have a conclusion, and then say it, right?)

1147
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:34,020
(Youngjoon: If you tell me to say it now, I can say it.)

1148
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:38,660
(Myeongkyun: But I... When I first saw you)

1149
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:39,900
(Myeongkyun: I didn't really have a... specific type of feeling.)

1150
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:46,540
(Myeongkyun: My first thought was, 'ah, we're on this together'.)

1151
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:52,740
(-Myeongkyun: 'Should I say hi? It's been a while'. That's all I thought. -Youngjoon: Okay.)

1152
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:57,780
(Myeongkyun: From my perspective, I thought, 'why must he pretend like he doesn't know me?')

1153
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:01,260
(-Youngjoon: Then you could've come and said hi first. Didn't I approach you first? -Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

1154
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:03,020
(Youngjoon: Didn't I say hi?)

1155
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:09,780
(Myeongkyun: But... that's not what I mean.)

1156
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:14,180
(Myeongkyun: Like how when you stopped contacting me,)

1157
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:19,620
(-Myeongkyun: you didn't explain to me clearly. -Youngjoon: Okay.)

1158
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:23,860
(-Myeongkyun: One day you were like, "because of something I don't like..." -Youngjoon: Because we weren't dating.)

1159
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:27,220
(-Myeongkyun: Or like because we are close... -Youngjoon: We honestly weren't even flirting.)

1160
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:36,820
(Myeongkyun: I thought that no matter when, even if you needed time,)

1161
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:41,620
(Myeongkyun: you would explain to me properly and we might get back together.)

1162
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:44,900
(Youngjoon: Ah, or even just tell you to stop contacting me?)

1163
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:45,000
(Youngjoon: Or how we should get back together.)

1164
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,540
-Or how we should get back together. -Yeah, it's been a while...
(Youngjoon: Or how we should get back together.)

1165
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:47,610
(-Youngjoon: Was that what you were anticipating? Is that why you kept contacting me? Because you thought there might be a chance? -Myeongkyun: Yeah, that's why.)
-Or how we should get back together. -Yeah, it's been a while...
(Youngjoon: Or how we should get back together.)

1166
01:12:47,610 --> 01:12:51,980
(-Youngjoon: Was that what you were anticipating? Is that why you kept contacting me? Because you thought there might be a chance? -Myeongkyun: Yeah, that's why.)

1167
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:56,460
(Myeongkyun: I'm the type that... will wait for someone.)

1168
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:58,820
(Myeongkyun: I thought maybe there's a reason.)

1169
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:01,340
(-Youngjoon: You said you waited? -Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

1170
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:05,300
(-Myeongkyun: But then later... -Youngjoon: Waited for what?)

1171
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:07,140
(Youngjoon: Did I promise you anything?)

1172
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:08,220
(Myeongkyun: No, that's not what happened but)

1173
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:12,700
(Myeongkyun: I think it'd be nice if we contacted each other at times.)

1174
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:16,500
(Myeongkyun: Just simply, simply just...)

1175
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:22,180
(Myeongkyun: hanging out together and seeing each other...)

1176
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:26,700
(Youngjoon: Yes, I didn't fully cut off contact)

1177
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:31,260
(Youngjoon: and I never said I didn't want to see you again so I made you misunderstand.)

1178
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:34,500
(Myeongkyun: It's not like that...)

1179
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:39,540
(Myeongkyun: Even so... I'm happy to see you again.)

1180
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,900
(Myeongkyun: It's been a while.)

1181
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:46,380
(Youngjoon: Sure, I'm okay with that.)

1182
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:49,460
(Youngjoon: It's true that I was surprised to see you at Men's House)

1183
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:54,380
(Youngjoon: but I didn't feel uncomfortable because of you.)

1184
01:13:54,860 --> 01:14:00,300
(Myeongkyun: But... according to my gut feeling,)

1185
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:02,160
(Myeongkyun: it feels like you're trying to... control me.)

1186
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:05,720
It feels like you're trying to... control me.
(Myeongkyun: it feels like you're trying to... control me.)

1187
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:06,860
(-Youngjoon: Me? -Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

1188
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:11,060
(Myeongkyun: I don't care. If you like him then just date him.)

1189
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:14,380
(Myeongkyun: Or if I like him, I'll seduce him.)

1190
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:18,780
(Myeongkyun: But... I don't really understand right now.)

1191
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:23,720
(Myeongkyun: Because when I said I didn't care,

1192
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:23,740
see, you can tell the others, I really don't care.
(Myeongkyun: Because when I said I didn't care,

1193
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:27,540
(Myeongkyun: see, you can tell the others, I really don't care.)
see, you can tell the others, I really don't care.

1194
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:29,980
(Myeongkyun: Whether we know each other or if it's our first time meeting.)

1195
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:32,060
(Youngjoon: Since I'm wasting my time talking to you right now,)

1196
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:34,780
(Youngjoon: I can't even go talk with the others.)

1197
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:37,380
(Youngjoon: Can't you just hurry up and tell me?)

1198
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:39,580
(Youngjoon: I don't want to waste my time on you.)

1199
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:42,900
(Youngjoon: I want to go talk to Hanmin.)

1200
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:48,460
(Youngjoon: If I ask about A, you answer Z.)

1201
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:49,700
(Myeongkyun: That's why I said it's okay.)

1202
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:51,980
(Myeongkyun: I didn't do anything.)

1203
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:55,540
(Youngjoon: You didn't do anything? Then what's with the anonymous question?)

1204
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:58,100
(Myeongkyun: What? Did I say something?)

1205
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:01,860
(Youngjoon: 'He doesn't seem sincere.' Didn't you say that I'm hiding something?)

1206
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:05,060
(Youngjoon: What are you curious about? Why did you ask that?)

1207
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:09,220
(Youngjoon: What am I hiding? How am I not honest?)

1208
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:11,980
(Myeongkyun: You just seem different from usual.)

1209
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:14,460
(Youngjoon: Just because I seem different, does that mean I'm hiding something?)

1210
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:16,660
(Myeongkyun: No, I mean...)

1211
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:19,580
(-Myeongkyun: Did I say that you're hiding something? -Youngjoon: Yeah.)

1212
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:22,980
(Myeongkyun: No, I...)

1213
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,940
(Youngjoon: Didn't you say that I have a secret? One that I can't tell?)

1214
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:27,900
(Youngjoon: Didn't you say that I have a secret? One that I will deny?)

1215
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:33,460
(-Youngjoon: Didn't you say that I'll deny it when asked? -Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

1216
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:36,940
(-Youngjoon: Tell me. Make me deny it. -Myeongkyun: No.)

1217
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:39,340
(Youngjoon: Forget it.)

1218
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:43,070
(In the end, Youngjoon leaves first)

1219
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:44,050
Gosh.
(In the end, Youngjoon leaves first)

1220
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:53,820
(Youngjoon: You're the one who said I can tell everyone.)

1221
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:57,740
(Youngjoon: When all eight people are here, I'm going to tell them.)

1222
01:15:57,740 --> 01:16:02,020
(-Myeongkyun: What do you want to hear me say? Didn't you hear everything already? -Youngjoon: I'm not hiding anything.)

1223
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:03,980
(Youngjoon: But you said I'm hiding something.)

1224
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:05,900
(Youngjoon: So to not hide anything, I'm going to tell everything I know)

1225
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:08,340
(Youngjoon: to everyone.)

1226
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:14,660
(-Youngjoon: You said okay so don't regret this later on. -Myeongkyun: What did I say?)

1227
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:21,780
(The conversation ends without settlement and only the conflict has deepened)

1228
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:25,580
(Youngjoon: There was no progress in the conversation.)

1229
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:28,340
(Youngjoon: No matter how long I waited, I couldn't get the answer I wanted.)

1230
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:30,540
(Youngjoon: So the conversation ended one-sidedly.)

1231
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:32,260
Their conversation.

1232
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,180
Come in.

1233
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:38,300
(After the conversation, Youngjoon walks into Hanmin's room)

1234
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,250
Why do you look so tired
(After the conversation, Youngjoon walks into Hanmin's room)

1235
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:42,100
(Hanmin: Come here.)

1236
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:43,340
(Patting)

1237
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:47,700
(-Minseon: Do you two want to talk alone? -Youngjoon: It's okay.)

1238
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:52,100
(Minseon: Your lips are dry.)

1239
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:52,260
(Hanmin: Do you want some water?)

1240
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:54,220
-Do you want some water? -I'm okay.
(Hanmin: Do you want some water?)

1241
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:55,540
-Water. -I drank it.

1242
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:55,750
(Minseon: You should drink some water.)
-Water. -I drank it.

1243
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:57,660
(Minseon: You should drink some water.)

1244
01:16:57,660 --> 01:17:00,580
(Minseon: Give your skin some water.)

1245
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:05,180
But then... did you get the link?

1246
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:08,150
(Youngjoon tries talking about something else to change the topic)
But then... did you get the link?

1247
01:17:08,150 --> 01:17:09,420
-Why didn't I get that text? -Me too.
(Youngjoon tries talking about something else to change the topic)

1248
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:09,460
-Why didn't I get that text? -Me too.

1249
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:10,660
(Knock knock)
-Why didn't I get that text? -Me too.

1250
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:10,780
-Come in -Are you all here?
(Knock knock)
-Why didn't I get that text? -Me too.

1251
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:11,020
-Come in -Are you all here?

1252
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:11,910
(Myeongkyun: Are you all here?)
-Come in -Are you all here?

1253
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:13,980
They were here already.
(Myeongkyun: Are you all here?)

1254
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:14,640
They were here already.

1255
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:15,680
They were here already.

1256
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:16,660
-Really? -And me.

1257
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:16,740
(Youngjoon: Leave.)
-Really? -And me.

1258
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:17,660
(Youngjoon: Leave.)

1259
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:18,860
(-Myeongkyun: But... -Youngjoon: I said leave.)

1260
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:20,460
(-Myeongkyun: Why? Why? -Youngjoon: I said leave.)

1261
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:23,700
(-Myeongkyun: But there're only the four of us here. -Youngjoon: So?)

1262
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:24,780
(Youngjoon: I don't want to see you so leave.)

1263
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,500
(Myeongkyun: Why are you so angry?)

1264
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,740
(Youngjoon: Because I hate you.)

1265
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:28,740
(Myeongkyun: Really?)

1266
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:31,380
(The atmosphere is stiff again.)

1267
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:34,860
(Minseon: I don't want to see them fight again.)

1268
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:38,020
(Minseon: And I want to hear from Myeongkyun as to what happened.

1269
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:39,900
(Minseon: So I went out with Myeongkyun.)

1270
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:42,100
(Minseon: We went to my room and I talked with him.)

1271
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:45,900
(In the end, Minseon leaves with Myeongkyun.)

1272
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:46,620
What's wrong?

1273
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:47,140
(Although we talked for a long time, I can't calm myself down.)
What's wrong?

1274
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:51,780
(Although we talked for a long time, I can't calm myself down.)

1275
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:58,700
(Myeongkyun and Minseon entered the room.)

1276
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:03,660
(Myeongkyun: We talked for almost an hour)

1277
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:09,180
(-Myeongkyun: People never change. -Minseon: Really?)

1278
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:16,500
(-Minseon: I guess there was no conclusion. -Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

1279
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:21,460
(Minseon: But... I don't know either.)

1280
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:28,000
(-Minseon: What happened here? -Myeongkyun: I bumped it.)

1281
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:28,860
-What? -I bumped it.
(-Minseon: What happened here? -Myeongkyun: I bumped it.)

1282
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:29,120
(-Minseon: Where? -Myeongkyun: I don't know...)
-What? -I bumped it.
(-Minseon: What happened here? -Myeongkyun: I bumped it.)

1283
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:34,420
(-Minseon: Where? -Myeongkyun: I don't know...)

1284
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:38,740
(Myeongkyun's eyes are getting red.)

1285
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:44,020
(Myeongkyun: I haven't seen Youngjoon for a long time. I'm happy to see him.)

1286
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:47,700
(Myeongkyun: But...)

1287
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:55,860
(Myeongkyun: From the beginning, he wanted me to)

1288
01:18:55,860 --> 01:19:00,860
(Myeongkyun: do as he says.)

1289
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:05,660
(Myeongkyun: But from the beginning)

1290
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:11,060
(Myeongkyun: when he suddenly greeted me formally, it felt so weird.)

1291
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:15,540
(Myeongkyun: when he suddenly greeted me formally it felt so weird.)

1292
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:18,740
(Myeongkyun: If we had a talk...)

1293
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:19,580
(Myeongkyun: I would have told him everything.)

1294
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:23,500
(Myeongkyun: But he seemed uncomfortable so I couldn't say hello to him properly.)

1295
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:28,180
(Myeongkyun: I don't think I broke up nicely with Youngjoon either.)

1296
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:30,660
(Myeongkyun: Because we used to meet and keep in touch)

1297
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:31,190
(Myeongkyun: then we suddenly lost contact.)

1298
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:34,530
Then we suddenly lost contact.
(Myeongkyun: then we suddenly lost contact.)

1299
01:19:34,530 --> 01:19:35,580
(Myeongkyun: then we suddenly lost contact.)

1300
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:42,020
(Myeongkyun: Does this make sense? For relationships?)

1301
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:47,460
(Myeongkyun: According to him, he thought if we cut ties like this)

1302
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:49,900
(Myeongkyun: I would automatically... well...)

1303
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:52,380
(Myeongkyun: think that we broke up and won't contact him anymore.)

1304
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:56,660
(Myeongkyun: Does this even make sense in relationships?)

1305
01:19:56,660 --> 01:20:00,580
(Myeongkyun: Can you say that to someone else? To another person...)

1306
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:04,180
(Myeongkyun: Wow, really...)

1307
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:06,500
(-Myeongkyun: I'm sorry. -Minseon: Don't be sorry.)

1308
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:10,020
(-Myeongkyun: We're not even close yet. -Minseon: It's okay.)

1309
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:11,940
(Minseon: I didn't feel annoyed)

1310
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:14,260
(Minseon: and I wasn't sad with him.)

1311
01:20:14,890 --> 01:20:15,460
I just wanted to be there for him.

1312
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:20,300
(“I just wanted to be there for him.”)
I just wanted to be there for him.

1313
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:22,620
(Hanmin wants to hear Youngjoon's thoughts.)

1314
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:25,490
So I asked him what I was hiding.
(Hanmin wants to hear Youngjoon's thoughts.)

1315
01:20:25,490 --> 01:20:27,180
He asked me that, especially...
(Hanmin wants to hear Youngjoon's thoughts.)

1316
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:28,030
(Youngjoon: I don't keep the anonymous chat so I couldn't even check.)
He asked me that, especially...

1317
01:20:28,030 --> 01:20:29,780
(Youngjoon: I don't keep the anonymous chat so I couldn't even check.)

1318
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:34,700
(-Youngjoon: I asked him what I was hiding and he said it's a secret. -Hanmin: Another secret?)

1319
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:38,740
(Youngjoon: He keeps talking about other things. Things that don't matter.)

1320
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:43,300
(Youngjoon: We couldn't talk properly at all.)

1321
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,060
(Youngjoon: So I gave him 10 minutes.)

1322
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:47,860
(Youngjoon: "I'll be back in 10 minutes. Once you organize your thoughts, let me know.")

1323
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:51,930
(Youngjoon: But he told me to stay next to him because it'll be easier for him to think.)

1324
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:52,020
So I stayed for 1~2 minutes.
(Youngjoon: But he told me to stay next to him because it'll be easier for him to think.)

1325
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:53,780
(Youngjoon: So I stayed for 1~2 minutes.)
So I stayed for 1~2 minutes.

1326
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:56,260
(Youngjoon: He said the way I'm treating him)

1327
01:20:56,260 --> 01:21:01,220
(Youngjoon: isn't like what he remembered.)

1328
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:07,660
(Youngjoon: But does that mean I'm hiding something Now?)

1329
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:12,620
(Youngjoon: Does that mean I'm not honest and I'm hiding something?)

1330
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:19,500
(Youngjoon: I really wish the rest of the people saw me talking to Myeongkyun.)

1331
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:23,740
(Hanmin: To be honest, if you got mad)

1332
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:27,980
(-Hanmin: the others would think, 'why is he mad?' -Youngjoon: That's because they don't know what happened.)

1333
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:31,660
(Hanmin: They'll be surprised and the atmosphere will get stiff.)

1334
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:34,100
(Youngjoon: Yes, people will be aware of me.)

1335
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:37,660
(Youngjoon: 'Did something happen to Youngjoon?' 'Are you in a bad mood?')

1336
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:39,820
(Youngjoon: They'll think they can't get me mad and can't talk to me.)

1337
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:43,620
(Youngjoon: I really don't want to be someone who creates this type of atmosphere.)

1338
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:46,420
(-Youngjoon: People will think I don't belong in a group. -Hanmin: Just ignore him.)

1339
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:52,220
(Hanmin: People will think, 'they might have had a fight, so it's awkward.')

1340
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:52,500
-That's right. -Maybe they are not on good terms.
(Hanmin: People will think, 'they might have had a fight, so it's awkward.')

1341
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,680
(Hanmin: Maybe they are not on good terms and then they'll forget it.)
-That's right. -Maybe they are not on good terms.

1342
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:57,230
-Maybe. -Yes.
(Hanmin: Maybe they are not on good terms and then they'll forget it.)

1343
01:21:57,230 --> 01:21:59,070
I just brought it.
(Hanmin: Maybe they are not on good terms and then they'll forget it.)

1344
01:21:59,070 --> 01:22:00,580
(Hanmin: Maybe they are not on good terms and then they'll forget it.)

1345
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:03,820
(Hanmin: This is a difficult question.)

1346
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:07,460
(Hanmin: Because of this situation, I can't do anything.)

1347
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:10,420
(Hanmin: I feel sorry for Myeongkyun.)

1348
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:15,700
(But I can only be on Youngjoon's side.)

1349
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:18,500
(On the other side.) Seongmin and Hwi are talking in a room of four.

1350
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:22,580
(Ha...)

1351
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:28,820
(Hwi: Lie down Lie down)

1352
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:31,500
Hwi: Take a break.

1353
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:41,020
(Seongmin: You and Jaeseung)

1354
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:51,940
(-Seongmin: You two... seem to like each other. -Hwi: Yeah...)

1355
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:57,100
(-Hwi: Are you comfortable with me? -Seongmin: Yeah.)

1356
01:22:57,100 --> 01:23:00,460
(Hwi: I can't decide yet. What should I do?)

1357
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:03,540
(-Seongmin: I'll check with Jaeseung one last time then come back. -Hwi: Huh?)

1358
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:07,460
(Seongmin: I'll check with Jaeseung one last time then come back.)

1359
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:10,180
-They came in. -Why are you here?

1360
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:11,860
(Minseon: Why are you here?)
-They came in. -Why are you here?

1361
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:14,700
(Seongmin: Is it rice cake? I want to eat it.)

1362
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:16,980
(Minseon: Hello? You need to rearrange the rooms.)

1363
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:17,620
(Seongmin: Why? Why? Why?)

1364
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:20,460
(Seungjin: No, I have to sleep in this room tonight.)

1365
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:22,460
(Rearrange the rooms please.)

1366
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:24,060
(Can't we do it again?)

1367
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:27,340
(I don't want to hear it~)

1368
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:31,300
(Seungjin: I'd better practice dancing.)

1369
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:34,940
(Seungjin: There's another mirror. Good.)

1370
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:36,820
(Come~)

1371
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:37,140
(Help turn off the light)

1372
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:38,690
Turn off the light
(Help turn off the light)

1373
01:23:38,690 --> 01:23:39,180
(Help turn off the light)

1374
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:41,580
(What is it?)

1375
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:45,740
(Oh! Oh!)

1376
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:47,990
Why? Why?

1377
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:51,220
(He really dances well!)

1378
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:53,780
(Seungjin left for a long time and there's laughter in the room)

1379
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:55,420
This part is so funny.
(Seungjin left for a long time and there's laughter in the room)

1380
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:56,700
(Seungjin left for a long time and there's laughter in the room)

1381
01:23:57,740 --> 01:23:58,660
This?

1382
01:23:58,660 --> 01:23:59,000
(At this moment Seongmin quietly walked out of the room)
This?

1383
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,420
(At this moment Seongmin quietly walked out of the room)

1384
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:04,340
(Seongmin: I'll go down first.)

1385
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:08,140
(-Hwi: Where are you going? -Seongmin: What?)

1386
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:10,260
(Seongmin: I'm leaving first.)

1387
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:20,200
(Seongmin leaves the room and goes to find Jaeseung)

1388
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,490
What are you doing?
(Seongmin leaves the room and goes to find Jaeseung)

1389
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:26,980
(Two men are chatting on the balcony)

1390
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:35,220
(Jaeseung: I used to think my honesty was my weapon.)

1391
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:45,620
(Jaeseung: But now that I think about it, I don't think it is.)

1392
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:56,460
(Jaeseung: I know you're hesitating between me and Hwi.)

1393
01:24:56,980 --> 01:25:04,660
(Seongmin: But I wanted to tell you that I want to go on a date with you.)

1394
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:10,700
(Seongmin: But I wanted to tell you that I want to go on a date with you.)

1395
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:16,300
(Seongmin: I never went out during the day before.)

1396
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:25,750
(Seongmin: I want to go on a date with you tomorrow.)

1397
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:25,780
What's wrong? What's wrong?
(Seongmin: I want to go on a date with you tomorrow.)

1398
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:26,260
What's wrong? What's wrong?

1399
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:28,200
(Jaeseung laughs after listening to Seongmin)
What's wrong? What's wrong?

1400
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,900
(Jaeseung laughs after listening to Seongmin)

1401
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:30,380
(Seongmin: I heard you helped Seungjin pick out the fish bones.)

1402
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:35,400
(-Seongmin: I heard you helped Seungjin pick out the fish bones. -No.)
(Seongmin: I heard you helped Seungjin pick out the fish bones.)

1403
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:36,060
(Seongmin: I heard you helped Seungjin pick out the fish bones.)

1404
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:38,740
(Seongmin: You should be nice to me, too.)

1405
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:42,140
(Seongmin: Then I'll be nice to you, too.)

1406
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:43,580
(Seongmin: We should go on a date together.)

1407
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:46,100
(Seongmin: I thought you never went on a date. Other than that night.)

1408
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:56,180
("Go on a date with me. From morning to night.)

1409
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:00,540
(Seongmin: I don't want to hear his hidden thoughts.)

1410
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:05,340
(Seongmin: I want Jaeseung to know how I feel.)

1411
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:07,580
(Jaeseung: After the anonymous chat,)

1412
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:12,140
(Jaeseung: after talking to Seongmin,)

1413
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:15,340
(Jaeseung: I cleared my misunderstandings towards Seongmin.)

1414
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:18,940
(Jaeseung: so I want to get to know Seongmin more.)

1415
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:22,620
(Jaeseung: Let's talk more.)

1416
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:25,140
(Seongmin: Ah, I'm going crazy.)

1417
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:27,500
(-Hwi: Did you talk with Jaeseung? -Seongmin: Yeah.)

1418
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:31,180
(Hwi: What did you... talk about?)

1419
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:34,420
(Seongmin: I told him I want to go on a date with him.)

1420
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:36,820
(-Seongmin: I told him I want to go on a date with him. -Hwi: To go on a date with him?)

1421
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:41,060
(-Seongmin: Yeah. I said let's go on a date. -Hwi: But I want to go on a date, too.)

1422
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:43,500
(Hwi: But I want to go on a date, too.)

1423
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:47,260
(Hwi: We only had one date.)

1424
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:59,370
(Hwi: Our first date was during the beginning.)

1425
01:26:59,370 --> 01:26:59,660
You know? It's a bit awkward.
(Hwi: Our first date was during the beginning.)

1426
01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:02,220
(-Hwi: I went on a date the next day. It's a bit awkward. -Seomgin: Yeah.)

1427
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:02,900
(-Hwi: I went on a date the next day. It's a bit awkward. -Seomgin: Yeah.)

1428
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:07,260
(Hwi: In this situation, I want to go on another date.)

1429
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:20,820
(Hwi: I'm really tired here.)

1430
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:22,140
(Hwi: No, you are the most tired.)

1431
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:25,590
Let me do it.

1432
01:27:26,930 --> 01:27:27,910
Okay.

1433
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:29,660
(Hwi: Sit down here.)

1434
01:27:30,430 --> 01:27:31,140
-There aren't many bowls. We should wash it. -I'll wash it.

1435

(Seongmin can't hide his guilt and Hwi pretends like nothing is wrong)

(Seongmin: Hwi,)

1438
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:47,380
(Seongmin: I'm interested in both you and Jaeseung.)

1439
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:55,020
(Seongmin: Today, Jaeseung...)

1440
01:27:55,020 --> 01:28:01,380
(Seongmin: I was attracted to Jaeseung today so I asked him to go out on a date.)

1441
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:13,580
(Hwi hasn't responded to Seongmin)

1442
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:15,740
(-Seongmin: I'm sorry. -Hwi: What?)

1443
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:18,460
(-Seongmin: I'm sorry. -Hwi: Why are you sorry?)

1444
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:22,260
(Hwi: Don't be sorry.)

1445
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:25,060
(Seongmin: I think I'm asking for too much)

1446
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:28,980
(Seongmin: because, to be honest, Jaeseung was my ideal type at the start.)

1447
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:33,000
(Seongmin: But personality wise, Hwi you are.)

1448
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:33,300
But I want the both of you. Really.
(Seongmin: But personality wise, Hwi you are.)

1450
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:35,900
("I want the both of you.")
But I want the both of you. Really.

1451
01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:42,180
(Pretending to be okay, but tonight is extra difficult for Hwi...)

1452
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:45,420
(Wants to cry)

1453
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:53,980
(The new chaotic mission is coming)

1454

(Youngjoon: Don't choose?)

1455
01:28:57,780 --> 01:29:00,060
(Youngjoon: Should we not choose either?)

1456
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:01,700
(Hanmin: With a face being stabbed in the back,)

1457
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:03,980
(Hanmin: what should I do?)

1458
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:07,500
(Hwi: Oh! I won!)

1459
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,420
(Hwi: I finally got a chance to choose.)

1460
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:11,260
Hwi: I just feel very excited.

1461
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:15,100
("Forget it, I won't choose.")

1462
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:18,220
(Jaeseung: I put down the card right away.)

1463
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:19,820
(Jaeseung: It's a meaningless card.)

1464
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:23,860
(Myeongkyun looks troubled and hesitant.

1465
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:26,540

(Myeongkyun and Youngjoon don't look too happy)

1468

He doesn't seem to like it.

1469
01:29:31,780 --> 01:29:34,460
(Youngjoon: It seems like you have something to say.)

1470
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:38,500
(Myeongkyun: I don't think the atmosphere is nice.)

1471
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:44,000
(Can the two of them successfully ease their discomfort?)
