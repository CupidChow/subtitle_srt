(Myeonggyun driving his car to get to the date location)

12
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,940
(Minseon: I'm really curious about the date location)

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,660
(Myeongkyun: You'll know when you get there)

14
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,540
(Minseon: Do you know what we do there?)

15
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,700
(Myeongkyun: Of course)
(Minseon: Really? Wow, I'm looking forward to what we'll do)

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,300
(Myeongkyun: I was thinking where to go)

17
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:13,860
(Myeongkyun: Look forward to...)
(Minseon: Is it worth looking forward to? Or don't look forward to it?)

18
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,980
(Myeongkyun: Isn't it better to look forward to it?)
(Minseon: Really?)

19
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,940
(Myeongkyun: If you don't look forward to it at all...)
(Minseon: Of course. I'm (looking forward) to it to begin with)

20
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,780
Yeah.
(Myeongkyun: If you don't look forward to it at all...)
(Minseon: Of course. I'm (looking forward) to it to begin with)

21
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,620
(Myeongkyun: If you don't look forward to it at all...)
(Minseon: Of course. I'm (looking forward) to it to begin with)

22
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,780
(Myeongkyun: I think)

23
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,980
(Myeongkyun: you'll like it very much)

24
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,020
(Myeongkyun: Even if you don't like it very much, you wouldn't dislike it)
(Minseon: Something I like?)

25
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,620
(Minseon: It feels like something active)

26
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:41,620
(Minseon: Or crafts? Maybe that...)

27
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,520
(Minseon: I'm just guessing)

28
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:42,660
It's a bit of both.
(Minseon: I'm just guessing)

29
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:42,900
It's a bit of both.

30
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,900
(How accurate is the perceptive Minseon's prediction?)
It's a bit of both.

31
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,570
-A bit of both? -Yes.
(How accurate is the perceptive Minseon's prediction?)

32
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,580
(How accurate is the perceptive Minseon's prediction?)

33
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,060
(Minseon: You didn't sleep much last night. Are you okay?)

34
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,740
(Minseon: You stayed up last night. You barely slept for a few hours)

35
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,340
(Myeongkyun: Actually...)

36
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,140
(Myeongkyun: my condition's not great)

37
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,780
(Myeongkyun: But I'm excited)

38
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,980
(Minseon: Oh, really? That's a relief that you're excited)

39
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,860
(Minseon: When you shot me the "arrow" right away, I was really touched)

40
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,460
(Myeongkyun: I happened to get an arrow card)

41
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,580
(Minseon: Luckily you chose it)

42
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,300
(I wanted to go on a date with you)

43
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,100
(Myeongkyun: You took the initiative to call me yesterday)

44
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,740
(Minseon: I didn't receive a single call yesterday)

45
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,660
(Hesitant) (Myeongkyun: It was... a bit...)

46
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:34,860
(Minseon: I'm not upset about it)

47
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,140
(Minseon: Just that that was the situation)

48
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,060
(Minseon: I felt like I said something wrong)

49
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,060
(Minseon: Just because he didn't call me,)

50
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,700
(Minseon: I didn't want him to feel sorry)

51
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,420
(Minseon: I kept wishing I could take what I said back)

52
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:04,700
(Myeongkyun: But we can talk while on a drive. It's nice)
(Minseon: Yeah. I feel relaxed too)

53
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,660
(Minseon: Since yesterday, I thought you were so funny every time I talked to you)

54
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,550
Really?
(Minseon: Since yesterday, I thought you were so funny every time I talked to you)

55
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,260
(Minseon: I think we have a similar sense of humor)

56
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,860
(Myeongkyun: Is it a good thing?)
(Minseon: Of course)

57
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,220
(Myeongkyun: Cracking jokes requires only one thing)
(Minseon: What is it?)

58
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,140
(Myeongkyun: Courage)
(Hahaha. That's right)

59
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,140
(Myeongkyun: As long as you have courage, there's nothing you can't say)
(Hahaha, that's right)

60
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:28,540
(The two men on a date where they laugh even about trivial things)

61
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,930
(Location of Myeongkyun & Minseon's date: Diffuser and solid air freshener workshop)

62
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,350
I'm so excited.
(Location of Myeongkyun & Minseon's date: Diffuser and solid air freshener workshop)

63
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,850
(Location of Myeongkyun & Minseon's date: Diffuser and solid air freshener workshop)

64
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,270
I love diffusers.
(Location of Myeongkyun & Minseon's date: Diffuser and solid air freshener workshop)

65
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,880
(Location of Myeongkyun & Minseon's date: Diffuser and solid air freshener workshop)

66
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,230
I must have it at home.
(Location of Myeongkyun & Minseon's date: Diffuser and solid air freshener workshop)

67
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,060
(Myeongkyun: The first date I prepared was the diffuser workshop)

68
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,620
(Myeongkyun: I like things related to fragrances)

69
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,980
(Myeongkyun: Minseon also said he made soap yesterday)

70
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,020
(Myeongkyun: So I thought about having a date at the workshop)

71
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,460
(Myeongkyun: I decided on the diffuser workshop)

72
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,980
(Minseon: If I take home what I make,)

73
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,100
(Minseon: I think I'll be very happy)

74
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,580
(Minseon: I was very happy as soon as I went in)

75
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,540
(Minseon: What kind of flower do I remind you of?)
(Myeongkyun: Hmm...)

76
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,220
(Myeongkyun: Because I like roses)

77
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:10,580
-Roses? -Yes.

78
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,910
(Roses?)
-Roses? -Yes.

79
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,540
(Roses?)

80
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:19,339
(Myeongkyun: Among roses, if there are pink roses like this, it'd suit you)
(Minseon: Really?)

81
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:22,420
(Myeongkyun: A shade between beige and pink)

82
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,180
(Minseon: When I see you... I don't know many kinds of flowers)

83
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:35,060
(Minseon: Anyway, my favorite flower is the sunflower)
(Myeongkyun: Sunflowers?)

84
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,780
(Minseon: When you look at flowers, you have to bend down or go close)

85
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,980
(Minseon: But even if you look from far away, you can see it's a sunflower)

86
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,020
(Myeongkyun: I understand what you mean)
(Minseon: Right?)

87
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,980
(Myeongkyun: Eye-catching at a glance)
(Minseon: Yes. Eye-catching at a glance)

88
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,740
(Minseon: No matter who looks at it, it's obviously a sunflower)

89
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,220
(Nodding)

90
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,580
This is good.

91
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,860
(Minseon: Oh! It's pretty)

92
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,340
(Myeongkyun: How about finishing up after this?)

93
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,210
Just do that?
(Myeongkyun: How about finishing up after this?)

94
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,780
(Myeongkyun: It's been a while since I felt the agony of creation)

95
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,740
(Minseon: Oh, but it's colorful. It's pretty)

96
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,460
(Myeongkyun: I'm in big trouble)
(Minseon: What's wrong?)

97
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,380
(Myeongkyun: I want to start designing the flowers again)

98
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,300
(Minseon: Why?)
(Myeongkyun: I feel... like...)

99
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:29,460
(Minseon: We still have a lot of time. Take your time)
(Myeongkyun: Oh, that's a good idea)

100
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,580
(Myeongkyun: I really wanted to make a perfect one)

101
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,540
(Myeongkyun: to make him 100% satisfied)

102
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,460
(Myeongkyun: Although it's my first time, I really want to make it well)

103
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:45,060
(Minseon: When you had to invite someone on a date, why did you pick me?)

104
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,460
(Minseon: I was curious)

105
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,300
(Myeongkyun: When I invited you on a date?)

106
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,580
(Hmm...)

107
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,260
(Myeongkyun: First, I've been interested in you since yesterday)

108
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:09,260
(Myeongkyun: I was curious what you were like. I wanted to have a deeper conversation with you)

109
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,420
(Myeongkyun: The moment I saw you holding the heart card, I thought...)

110
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,180
(Myeongkyun: I should just (invite you) right away. That's what I thought)

111
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,580
(Minseon: That's a relief. Did you want to go on a date with me from the beginning?)
(Myeongkyun: Yes)

112
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,380
(Minseon: Oh, really? I'm so happy. Thank you)

113
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,620
(Minseon: When I called you yesterday,)

114
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,140
(Minseon: I was really nervous. When I called you yesterday)

115
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,380
(Myeongkyun: Thank you)

116
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,100
(Minseon: It's positive nervousness)

117
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,140
(Minseon: I'm suddenly curious)

118
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,980
(Minseon: What was your first impression of me?)

119
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,940
(Myeongkyun: First impression? You looked very cheerful)

120
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,340
(Minseon: Do I look cheerful?)

121
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,940
(Minseon: We said the same thing)

122
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,100
(Minseon: I said you looked bright)

123
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,060
(Minseon: My first impression of you was that you looked bright)

124
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,740
(Myeongkyun: Because of my big eyes?)

125
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,620
(Minseon: No, it's not because of big eyes)

126
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,620
(Minseon: What I meant was your vibe? The atmosphere?)

127
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,940
(Minseon: It felt like the atmosphere changed with your entrance)

128
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,020
(Minseon: Something like that)

129
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:22,260
(Myeongkyun: (People usually tell me) their first impression of me is that I have bright eyes)
(Minseon: Really?)

130
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,820
(Minseon: That you look kind?)

131
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,940
(Myeongkyun: To put it childishly, it's like they're shiny)

132
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,610
(Minseon: It's not childish but a cute description)

133
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,910
-Really? -Yes.
(Minseon: It's not childish but a cute description)

134
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:31,420
(Minseon: It's not childish but a cute description)

135
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,220
(Myeongkyun: Because I graduated from Waffle University)
(T/N: "Waffle University" is the name of a Korean waffle shop)

136
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:43,020
(Myeongkyun: I have a limited vocab which extends up to "shiny")
(Minseon: Gosh, I shouldn't laugh)

137
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,460
(Minseon: I crack up easily)

138
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,460
(Minseon: at goofy stuff and jokes)

139
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,340
(Minseon: I laugh really easily)

140
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,700
(Minseon: But he always makes me laugh)

141
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,700
(Minseon: So I think we're really compatible (in terms of humor))

142
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,020
(Myeongkyun: Some people might not think it's funny)

143
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,180
(Myeongkyun: and not understand why we're laughing)

144
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:08,740
(Myeongkyun: As they say, it's a niche sense of relating to each other)

145
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,900
(Myeongkyun: Only those who know it, know it)

146
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,620
(Ah, it smells so good)

147
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:20,220
(Minseon: I can't smell this one, but I love this one. It's so pretty)

148
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,020
(Myeongkyun: It smells like the flower shop I used to go to often when I was young)

149
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,580
(Minseon: Ah, really?)

150
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,300
(Minseon: You can't smell it. Because the bottle cap is closed)

151
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,940
(Minseon: Oh, it smells good. I can't help but smell it)

152
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,940
(Minseon: Where should I put this? Somewhere precious)
(Myeongkyun: By your bed)

153
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,539
(Minseon: By my bed? Okay)

154
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:41,059
(Minseon: This time when I received (the diffuser and solid air freshener) from Myeongkyun,)

155
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,780
(Minseon: to a certain degree, it felt precious to me)

156
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:51,980
(A fragrant date that pulled them closer together)

157
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,900
(Location of Myeongkyun & Minseon's second date)

158
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,580
(Outdoor cafe by the blue river)

159
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,900
(Minseon: I love stuff like that. Blue sofa)

160
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,020
(Myeongkyun: It has a nice vibe)

161
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,180
(Myeongkyun: There)
(Minseon: Oh! Pink chairs!)

162
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,780
(Minseon: We can go up. Shall we take photos here?)
(Myeongkyun: Okay)

163
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,820
(A chair sculpture that attracts their attention)

164
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,220
(Minseon: This way or this way? Look this way from this way?)

165
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,420
(Focused)

166
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,900
(Minseon: I should include the chair and the background scenery)

167
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,580
(Minseon: During my date with Myeongkyun,)

168
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,740
(Minseon: I had so much fun)

169
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,660
(Minseon: I really wanted to commemorate it)

170
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,340
(Minseon: with many photos)

171
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:46,420
(Giving each other the photos they took)

172
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,290
This came out on the black side.
(Giving each other the photos they took)

173
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,340
(Giving each other the photos they took)

174
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,620
(Minseon: Shall we sit over there?)
(Myeongkyun: Okay)

175
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,020
(Myeongkyun: The whole scenery is nice, but my pose is so-so)

176
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,910
(Minseon: I think photos will turn out well on this sofa. Because there's a river behind)

177
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,960
Yes.
(Minseon: I think photos will turn out well on this sofa. Because there's a river behind)

178
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,380
(Myeongkyun: Shall we take a selfie here?)
(Minseon: I'd like that)

179
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,700
(Taking selfies full of excitement)

180
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,980
(Myeongkyun: A train just passed by)
(Minseon: A train?)

181
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,740
(Myeongkyun: A train, whoosh, passed by)
(Minseon: Did you get it in the photo?)

182
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,620
(Myeongkyun: I should've taken it)

183
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,780
(Minseon: Your face is so handsome)

184
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,820
(Minseon: The photo turned out nice)

185
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,740
(Minseon: Because the model looks good)

186
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,380
(Myeongkyun: But this...)

187
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,860
(We look good together)

188
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,740
Really?
(We look good together)

189
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,020
(We look good together)

190
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:38,620
(Chemistry is evident in their hearts and eyes)

191
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,100
I didn't expect that.
(Chemistry is evident in their hearts and eyes)

192
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,040
I didn't expect that.

193
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,020
-Thank you. -Thank you.

194
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,430
(Here's the food)
-Thank you. -Thank you.

195
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:42,810
(Here's the food)

196
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,500
-Looks yummy. -Looks yummy.
(Here's the food)

197
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,410
-Looks yummy. -Looks yummy.

198
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,100
(Myeongkyun: There's more meat in the middle)

199
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,700
(Minseon: It's rare to hear someone talk about meat for pizza)
(Myeongkyun: Pizza is also meat)

200
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,540
(Myeongkyun: Cheese is key. Do you agree?)
(Minseon: Agreed)

201
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,780
(Minseon: Cheese is the most important in pizza)

202
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,500
(Myeongkyun: Thank you for the food)
(Minseon: Thank you for the food)

203
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,220
(Minseon: I'll be the king's food taster)

204
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,790
(King's food taster)

205
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,750
I'm sorry.
(King's food taster)

206
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,670
It's okay.

207
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,460
(Mmm!) (Is it delicious?)

208
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:14,660
Then I'll try it with the mind of a king.

209
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,080
(Hahaha) (Myeongkyun: Then I'll try it with the mind of a king)
Then I'll try it with the mind of a king.

210
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,140
(Hahaha) (Myeongkyun: Then I'll try it with the mind of a king)

211
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,140
(Minseon: I'll be your food taster, Your Majesty)

212
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,660
(Myeongkyun: It's the satisfying taste of a king's meal)

213
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,660
(Myeongkyun: It's been a long time since I ate outside)
(Minseon: Me too)

214
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,180
(Minseon: Because it's hot in summer,)

215
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,180
(Minseon: I don't think about eating outdoors)

216
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,620
(Myeongkyun: I was curious about something. Can I ask?)

217
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,700
(Minseon: Of course you can ask)

218
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,500
(Myeongkyun: It's about ideal types)
(Minseon: About ideal types?)

219
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,780
(Myeongkyun: Looks-wise and personality-wise, what's your type?)

220
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,060
(Minseon: Looks-wise...)

221
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,020
(Minseon: I like those who look active)

222
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:09,340
(Minseon: Personality-wise, someone who seems cold but is considerate)

223
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,820
(Minseon: When I say that, people will ask if I mean a "tsundere")

224
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,260
(Minseon: I think it's right too)

225
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,340
(Minseon: But anyway, no matter what, he needs to be considerate)

226
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,540
(Minseon: I think being considerate is the best)

227
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,580
(Myeongkyun: I think I get what your type is)

228
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,940
(Minseon: What about you?)

229
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:33,820
(Myeongkyun: I don't think I have a fixed type)
(Minseon: Oh. Looks-wise?)

230
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:40,820
(Myeongkyun: Someone who fits me well when they're with me)

231
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,260
(Myeongkyun: I like that type)

232
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,460
(Myeongkyun: Personality-wise...)

233
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,420
(Myeongkyun: I'd say random nonsense from time to time)

234
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,300
(Myeongkyun: It'd be great if they're receptive of it)

235
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,700
(Minseon: I never thought you were talking nonsense)

236
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,140
(Minseon: So do you think I'm close to your ideal type?)

237
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,180
(Myeongkyun: It's very... very close)

238
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,980
(Minseon: Nice. That made me very happy)

239
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,260
(Minseon: I think you're close to my ideal type too)

240
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,820
(Myeongkyun: Actually, when I invited you on a date,)

241
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:22,420
(Myeongkyun: rather than saying it through words, I was glad I could do it through a card)

242
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,780
(Myeongkyun: I'm not good at saying cheesy stuff)

243
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:31,980
(Myeongkyun: So I invited you on a date with my card)

244
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,530
(Myeongkyun: I was wondering how you felt when you received it)

245
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:35,580
I also thought...
(Myeongkyun: I was wondering how you felt when you received it)

246
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,500
I also thought...

247
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,460
(Minseon: I wished I could get your date request)
I also thought...

248
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,020
(Minseon: I wished I could get your date request)

249
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,780
(Minseon: If you gave me your card,)

250
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,260
(Minseon: how should I react?)

251
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,540
(Minseon: That was what I was thinking)

252
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:54,800
(Minseon: When I really received your date request, I was surprised and stunned)

253
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,560
Okay.
(Minseon: When I really received your date request, I was surprised and stunned)

254
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,050
(Minseon: Then... This question just occurred to me)

255
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,330
-What is it? -Well...
(Minseon: Then... This question just occurred to me)

256
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:00,900
(Minseon: Then... This question just occurred to me)

257
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,140
(Minseon: What do you value the most in a relationship?)

258
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,940
(Myeongkyun: I hope we don't become too overly dependent on each other)

259
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:15,140
(Myeongkyun: Take care of yourself first and maintain your condition)

260
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,660
(Myeongkyun: Rather than compromising without question)

261
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,220
(Myeongkyun: An appropriate amount of selfishness?)

262
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,220
(Minseon: An appropriate amount of selfishness? With your own opinions?)

263
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,320
(Myeongkyun: I think it's good to express your opinions)

264
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,210
Yeah.
(Myeongkyun: I think it's good to express your opinions)

265
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,740
(Minseon: For me... As long as you don't lie)

266
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,780
(Myeongkyun: Lies?)
(Minseon: I don't like lies)

267
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:36,340
(Minseon: If you don't get caught, I won't know either. So it doesn't matter)

268
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,180
(Minseon: But if I find out, it'll upset me)

269
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,300
(Myeongkyun: Lies? Lies...)

270
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,660
(Myeongkyun: It's not easy for me to lie)

271
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,980
(Minseon: I think so too)

272
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:52,020
(Myeongkyun: It's really easy to know my real thoughts)

273
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,420
(Myeongkyun: I wear my heart on my sleeves)

274
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,660
(Did the two get to know each other's true feelings?)

275
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,300
(Myeongkyun: In general, what did you think of the date?)
(Minseon: In general?)

276
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,740
(Minseon: I had so much fun)

277
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,780
(Minseon: Time flew by)

278
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:12,180
(Minseon: Not a moment did I feel tired)

279
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:17,020
(Minseon: I'd love to go on another date with you)

280
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,500
(Myeongkyun: Similarly, I was...)

281
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:26,620
(Myeongkyun: I tried to have a relaxing date, and I had a lot of fun)
(Minseon: Oh, really?)

282
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,620
(Minseon: That's a relief)

283
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,540
(Myeongkyun: I feel like the more I talk to you,)

284
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,640
(Myeongkyun: the more we seem compatible)

285
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,720
Really?
(Myeongkyun: the more we seem compatible)

286
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,380
(Myeongkyun: the more we seem compatible)

287
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,100
(Myeongkyun: Very interesting!)

288
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,140
(Minseon: Thank you for the positive feedback)

289
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,140
(Myeongkyun: To be honest,)

290
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,740
(Myeongkyun: I thought it'd be nice to go on a date)

291
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,140
(Myeongkyun: with others too)

292
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:54,420
(Minseon: Before we went on a date, I was really curious about him)

293
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,420
(Minseon: After the date, I felt we got along well)

294
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,780
(Minseon: I became a lot more interested in (Myeongkyun))

295
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,620
(Minseon: What could the others be doing?)

296
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,580
(Myeongkyun: Right. I'm curious about Jaeseung, who's at home)
(Minseon: Ah, yes)

297
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,820
(Myeongkyun: He's at home, right?)

298
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,100
(Minseon: I... I had so much fun)

299
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,380
(Minseon: I thought everyone else is on a date too)

300
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,380
(Minseon: Right, Jaeseung and...)

301
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,940
(Myeongkyun: I'm most curious about (Jaeseung & Hwi))

302
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,340
(Minseon: Jaeseung and... who was it? Hwi!)

303
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,580
(Minseon: I'm really curious how Hwi's doing)

304
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:28,900
(At the same time, in Men's House...)

305
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,100
(Hwi's taking a nap)

306
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,380
(Jaeseung goes back to his bedroom to rest)

307
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,060
(Checking his face)

308
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,460
(Patting)

309
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,060

(What is it?)

312
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:07,660
(Jaeseung: What is this? Is there another mission?)

313

(We had a super (?) serious conversation)

326

(Jaeseung: We're making Tanghulu)

331
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,300
(Jaeseung: But till now, the white sugar is still not turning into syrup)

332
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,220
(Seungjin: Why not? Did you add water?)

333
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,420
(Seongmin: Can you make Tanghulu?)

334
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,980

(Sugar Expert Seungjin)
(Seungjin: (The syrup) can’t be brown. You have to dip it when it's white)

339
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,300
(Seungjin: Also, it doesn't need to be sticky)

340
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,500
(Seungjin: It becomes stiff after cooling down)

341
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,940
(Jaeseung: You know it well. Should you've made it instead?)

342
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,900
(Seungjin: Have you ever stirred (the syrup)?)

343
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,460
(Jaeseung: No. Isn't it about to turn brown now?)

344
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,100

(Analyzing why the Tanghulu failed)
(Seungjin: I think you should throw this away)

347
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,310
(Out!)

348
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,620
-No wonder it didn't work. -It's pretty, the Tanghulus.
(Out!)

(Tanghulu: failed!)

352
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,420
(Seungjin: But we can eat... the delicious fruit skewers)

353
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,300
(Seungjin: But it'd be really yummy if they were made into Tanghulus)

354
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:08,060
(Jaeseung: Hwi said he couldn't give up on the Tanghulu and to keep boiling it)

355

(Jaeseung: Me? I made Hwi do weight training)

368
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,740
(Myeongkyun: That's not a date)

369
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,220
(Minseon: We made diffusers)
(Seongmin: Wow, good for you)

370

(Minseon: There's one more)

372
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,860
(Minseon: The lid needs to be opened to smell the fragrance)

373

(Minseon: This one. Smell this)

374
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,140
(Seungjin: Did you make soap?)

375
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,820
(Minseon: It's not soap. It's a kind of air freshener)

376
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,340
A solid diffuser.
(Minseon: It's not soap. It's a kind of air freshener)

377
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,310
-It smells good. -Right?

378
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,240
It smells so good.

379
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,840
I happen to need this at home.

380
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:06,260

(Wow)
This is my favorite smell.

382
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,730

It's shining. Look.

420
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,960
It shines under the light.

421
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,180
It's almost SK-II. Look.

432
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,660
(Myeongkyun: I don't think it was a romantic expression of love)

433
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,350
You'll get the wrong idea.

434

(Jaeseung: Then... let's go)
(Seongmin: Where to?)

(Let's go on a date, Seongmin)

446
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,140
(Jaeseung: I didn't have time to call Seongmin out alone)

447

(The men are confused by the unexpected situation)
I think Seongmin chose it.

456
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,410
Not Seongmin. I meant Jaeseung.
(The men are confused by the unexpected situation)

457

-Jaeseung? -Yes.

458
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,770
(Seungjin: Something must've happened)

459

466
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:45,100
(Jaeseung: Get ready. Let's meet at 7 p.m.)
(Seongmin: Okay)

467
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,740
(Jaeseung: What did I just do?)

468
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:01,340
(Jaeseung reads the mission card again)

469
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:06,900
(Here's a secret date chance for Jaeseung, who received the most calls yesterday)
Invite the man you like on a date)

470
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,020
(Seongmin: I've wanted to go on a date with Jaeseung)

471
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,340
(Seongmin: What kind of date will it be?)

472
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,660
(Seongmin: I'm nervous and excited)

473
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:22,260
(Half-nervous and half-excited, preparing for the date)

474
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,370
(Seungjin: Something must've happened)

475
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:25,860
I really don't know.
(Seungjin: Something must've happened)

476
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,090
(Seungjin: I suddenly have an idea)
I really don't know.
(Seungjin: Something must've happened)

477
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,300
(Seungjin: I suddenly have an idea)

478
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,740
(Seungjin: Yesterday, only (Jaeseung and Seongmin) called each other)

479
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,300
(Devastated)

480
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,500
(Hwi: Ah, hang on, ah...)

481
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,580
(Hwi: This is agonizing)

482
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:50,420
(Hwi: Sigh... Ah... I was so annoyed)

483
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,940
(Hwi: Everything's annoying)

484
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:57,700
(Jaeseung & Seongmin finish preparing for their date)

485
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,300
(Hwi: Where are you going?)
(Jaeseung: I don't know either)

486
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,620
(Hwi: Where are you going?)
(Seongmin: I really don't know what's going on)

487
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:03,820
I don't know either.

488
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,250
(Jaeseung & Seongmin leave in a hurry)
I don't know either.

489
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:04,550
(Jaeseung & Seongmin leave in a hurry)

490
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,150
Why did you smoke without me?
(Jaeseung & Seongmin leave in a hurry)

491
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:06,980
(Jaeseung & Seongmin leave in a hurry)

492
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,050
Why did you smoke without me?

493
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,660
(Hugging him tight)

494
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,220
(Hwi: After (Jaeseung and Seongmin) left, I felt wronged)

495
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,580
(Hwi: Youngjoon consoled me with a hug)

496
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:23,340
(Hwi: I really almost cried)

497
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:30,020
(Seungjin: Did Jaeseung know about this since the morning, so he didn't pick a mission card?)

498
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,420
(Seungjin: He knew this since the morning)

499
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,900
(Seungjin: That's why he didn't pick a card even when Youngjoon kept asking him to pick one)

500
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:41,670
(Minseon: It's possible!)
(Youngjoon: Was he acting the whole time?)

501
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:42,340
I feel like a genius.
(Minseon: It's possible!)
(Youngjoon: Was he acting the whole time?)

502
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,430
(Hwi: Right. He was the first to go down in the morning)
I feel like a genius.

503
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,340
(Hwi: Right. He was the first to go down in the morning)

504
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:45,780
(Youngjoon: It was so close to him)

505
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,130
-Right. -Right.
(Youngjoon: It was so close to him)

506
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,580
(Gosh, I'm really...)

507
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:53,020
(Youngjoon: We were all tricked)
(Seungjin: Crazy)

508
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,540
(Youngjoon: This might be a far-fetched assumption)

509
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:01,020
(Youngjoon: If that's really the case, (Jaeseung) is too scary)

510
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,980
(Youngjoon: It'd be too scary)

511
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,620
(Hanmin: Or maybe when (Jaeseung and Hwi) were at home,)

512
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:11,260
(Hanmin: when you were separated, another (mission card) was left on the table?)
(Minseon: It's possible too)

513
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,900
(Youngjoon: Maybe when Hwi was asleep, there was something on the table)

514
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,780
In my opinion, this is the most possible option.
(Youngjoon: Maybe when Hwi was asleep, there was something on the table)

515
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,440
(Minseon: This is the most possible option)
In my opinion, this is the most possible option.

516

(Minseon: This is the most possible option)

517
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,740
It must be this.

518
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,700
(Youngjoon: But it was a chance for one of you two)

519
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,870
(Youngjoon: But you fell asleep like a fool)

520
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,060
That's the most possible option.
(Youngjoon: But you fell asleep like a fool)

521
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:22,120
(Sleeping ruined your life!)
That's the most possible option.
(Youngjoon: But you fell asleep like a fool)

522
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,780
(Sleeping ruined your life!)

523
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,420
(Minseon: This makes the most sense)

524
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,140
Yes, that's the most possible.
(Minseon: This makes the most sense)

525
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,180
Yes, that's the most possible.

526
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,210
(Youngjoon: Then he hid the (mission card))
(Minseon: It must be this)
Yes, that's the most possible.

527
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,580
(Youngjoon: Then he hid the (mission card))
(Minseon: It must be this)

528
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,620
(Men's House in chaos after Jaeseung's sudden date request)

529
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,030
It must be this. Accurate.
(Men's House in chaos after Jaeseung's sudden date request)

530
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,750
-I think... -I heard that sound.
(Men's House in chaos after Jaeseung's sudden date request)

531
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,700
-What? -I think...

532
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,300
It's almost 90% right.

533
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,340
I heard a duck sound, like a beep.

534
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,500
(Youngjoon: We need to check the table in the living room every hour)

535
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,660
(Hwi: Wait! I want to check it first)

536
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,140
(Nothing)
(Checking the table for additional(?) mission cards)

537
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,500
(Minseon: For us, today's surprise is over)

538
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:48,940
-Yes. -We have no more surprises.

539
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,870
(What other changes will happen in Men's House today?)
-Yes. -We have no more surprises.

(Men are here to check their love fortunes)

542
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,080
I want to get one.
(Men are here to check their love fortunes)

543
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,350
I'm most curious about Hwi's.
(Men are here to check their love fortunes)

544
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:56,940
-Yes, Hwi. -It feels meaningless.
(Men are here to check their love fortunes)

545
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,590
(Cheering for Hwi wholeheartedly)
-Yes, Hwi. -It feels meaningless.

546
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,050
What is it? What is it?
(Cheering for Hwi wholeheartedly)

547
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,140
(Please get a good one)

548
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,110
(Hanmin: At least get a good fortune)

549
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,300
Which one do you want to get?
(Hanmin: At least get a good fortune)

550
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,780
(Youngjoon: Go get the one you want. Got it?)

551
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,300
(Youngjoon: Not what you can catch but what you want)

552
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,390
(Got it, little baby?)

553
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,780
-Got it? -Got it.
(Got it, little baby?)

(Hanmin: Heart thumping)
(Seungjin: Will you read it thrice?)

556
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,340
Read it yourself first.
(Hanmin: Heart thumping)
(Seungjin: Will you read it thrice?)

557
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,780
(Ah, so accurate)

558
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,260
(Why) (Why) (Why) (Why)

559
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:25,880
Be quiet.
(Why) (Why) (Why) (Why)

560
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,460
(You'll be plunged into confusion)

561
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,800
-Is that all? -Yes.
(You'll be plunged into confusion)

(You'll be plunged into confusion)

563

(Hwi: Why is it so accurate?)
-How's it... -How can it be so accurate?

(Hwi: Why is it so accurate?)

(Youngjoon: There's a reason you wanted the purple one)

567
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,660
(Hwi: If I'd known this would happen, I wouldn't have drawn (my love fortune). It's just like my current situation)

568
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,180
(Hwi: I was upset, so I threw it slightly)

569
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,540
(Hwi: I threw it slightly, without much force)

570
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,260
(After the storm-like time...)

571
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:50,460
♫I didn't mean it; I'm really sorry♫

572
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:56,380
(Hwi & Seungjin laying on the third floor to calm down)
♫I didn't mean it; I'm really sorry♫

573
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:01,180
(That wasn't intentional
I'm really sorry)

574
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,000
(Hwi: Is this the song you sang in the morning?)

575
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,060
Yes, so sad.
(Hwi: Is this the song you sang in the morning?)

576

(Who knows)
(Hwi: It's really the OST of today.)

577
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,030
(Hwi: To be honest, I feel a deep sense of betrayal.)

But I'm not worried that they will progress further.
(Hwi: To be honest, I feel a deep sense of betrayal.)

579

(Hwi: But I'm not worried that they (Jaeseung & Seongmin) will progress further.)
But I'm not worried that they will progress further.

580
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:20,100
(Seungjin: Good. Good. That’s the spirit.)

581
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,540
(Seungjin: But where are they going this late at night?)

582
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,460
(Hwi: Right? Where are they going now?
Seungjin: Are they going to spend the night outside?)

(Seungjin: I was just so shocked that they said they were going on a date.)

587
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:41,500
-I hope they go somewhere boring.
-That's right.

588

(Why care about that!)

612
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,820
(Exactly, why do I care about that?)

613
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,420
(Seungjin: Love needs to be fought for.
Hwi: That's right)

614
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,940
(Seungjin: But I wasn't able to fight for it...
Hwi: Yeah, me neither.)

615
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,020
(Seungjin: But I wasn't able to fight for it...)

616
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,180
(I'm a loser, loner)

617
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,260
(Seungjin: It makes me see the truth again, something like that?)

618
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:58,300
(Seungjin: That Jaeseung has a perfect liking for Seongmin now.)

619
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,580
(Hwi: The polaroids taken today...
Seungjin: Are you going to tear all of them?)

620
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:06,540
(I'm going to put them in the waffle machine!)
(Laugh)

621
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,980
(Hwi: Did I go too far? I suddenly feel sorry.)

622
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,120
(Hwi: I take that back. I take that back.)

623
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,340
It's really funny.
(Hwi: I take that back. I take that back.)

624
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,220
(Hwi: I take that back. I take that back.)

625
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,820
(Seungjin: Yes, you think the same.)

626
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,580
(Seungjin: Like how you want to get along well with Seongmin,)

627
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,580
(Seungjin: Jaeseung shares the same thought.)

628
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:26,700
(Seungjin: Seongmin may not have any thoughts about it.)

629
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:33,300
(Hwi: No, Seongmin and I are more compatible.)
(Yeah)

630
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,940
(That's right!)

631
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,540
(Hwi: Why did you turn your head? Why did you turn your head?
Seungjin: This is fate.)

632
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:46,020
(Seungjin: But what do you like about Seongmin?)

633
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,580
(Hwi: I don't know either. Just...)

634
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:53,280
(Hwi: I don't have a fixed ideal type to start with. A wide range.)

635
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,300
But feels like it's slowly becoming Seongmin.
(Hwi: I don't have a fixed ideal type to start with. A wide range.)

636
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,980
(Hwi: I feel like my ideal type is slowly becoming Seongmin.)
((Ha...))
But feels like it's slowly becoming Seongmin.

637
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,460
(Hwi: I feel like my ideal type is slowly becoming Seongmin.)
((Ha...))

638
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:06,860
(On the other hand,
what are the other men in Men's House doing?)

639
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,220
(The men who are sharing about today's date)

640
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,640
Did you make two things at the same place?
(The men who are sharing about today's date)

641
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,260
No, no.
(The men who are sharing about today's date)

642
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,460
-Wax and... -Yes one place.
(The men who are sharing about today's date)

643
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,280
We did it at the same place.
(The men who are sharing about today's date)

644
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,140
-After that we went to a cafe.
-Yeah, we went to a cafe.
(The men who are sharing about today's date)

645
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,060
-After that we went to a cafe.
-Yeah, we went to a cafe.

646
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,500
(Youngjoon: You always do a lot of things.
Minseon: Yes.)

647
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:16,780
It's good.
(Youngjoon: You always do a lot of things.
Minseon: Yes.)

648
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,110
(Youngjoon: Making a ring which was something I've never done even when I was dating.
Minseon: I've never worn a ring before either)
It's good.
(Youngjoon: You always do a lot of things.
Minseon: Yes.)

649
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:21,620
(Youngjoon: Making a ring which was something I've never done even when I was dating.
Minseon: I've never worn a ring before either)

650
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,380
(Myeongkyun: Me neither!)

651
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:22,460
I've never worn a couple ring.
(Myeongkyun: Me neither!)

652
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,480
(Minseon: I've never worn a couple ring. I'm so jealous.)
I've never worn a couple ring.

653
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,080
-It's my first time making it.
-I'm so jealous.
(Minseon: I've never worn a couple ring. I'm so jealous.)

654
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,020
(Youngjoon: We're wearing a couple ring so stop eyeing us.)

655
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,940
(Myeongkyun: I don't like it. It looks like a thorn.)

656
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,820
(Myeongkyun: Hanmin is not the type that Youngjoon would like.)

657
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,740
(Myeongkyun: Given Youngjoon's type, I should attract him more.

658
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,940
I have nothing to say.

659
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:43,600
(Leaving only Youngjoon and Myeongkyun
after Hanmin and Minseon left)

660
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,580
The last person to leave should turn off the lights.
(Leaving only Youngjoon and Myeongkyun
after Hanmin and Minseon left)

661
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,460
The last person to leave should turn off the lights.

662
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,460
(Youngjoon: But we are not eating dinner, so when are we going to say it?
Myeongkyun: Say what?)

663
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,380
(Youngjoon: That we know each other.
Myeongkyun: Right.)

664
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,660
(Myeongkyun: We don't have to say it.)

665
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,860
(But there's no need to hide it.)
(Minseon enters the room at this time)

666
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,700
(Myeongkyun: There's no one who's curious about it.)

667
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,780
(Youngjoon: But I feel like... Rather than hiding it...)

668
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,020
-Go ahead. -I just want to casually mention it.

669
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,640
(Minseon is watching their conversation)
-Go ahead. -I just want to casually mention it.

670
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,520
-I don't care.
-That we knew each other before.
(Minseon is watching their conversation)

671
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,180
(Minseon is watching their conversation)

672
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,220
I don't care. Just say.
(Minseon is watching their conversation)

673
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:16,700
I don't feel comfortable cause it's so vague.

674
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,130
(Youngjoon and Myeongkyun's conversation which seems like a secret to Minseon)
I don't feel comfortable cause it's so vague.

675
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,060
-I got it.
-What's wrong?
(Youngjoon and Myeongkyun's conversation which seems like a secret to Minseon)

676
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,710
(Minseon: What's wrong?)
-I got it.
-What's wrong?

677
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,420
(Minseon: What's wrong?)

678
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,700
(Youngjoon: Actually, we knew each other.
Minseon: Really?)

679
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,460
(Youngjoon: So I was going to gather everyone tomorrow and talk about it.)

680
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,860
(Youngjoon: We're talking about when we should talk about it.)

681
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,220
-I don't care.
-But everyone's out.
(Youngjoon: We're talking about when we should talk about it.)

682
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:30,420
-I don't care.
-But everyone's out.

683
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:30,720
(Youngjoon finally revealing that
he knows Myeongkyun)
-I don't care.
-But everyone's out.

684
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,850
He kept trying to discuss the timing with me.
(Youngjoon finally revealing that
he knows Myeongkyun)

685
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,220
-They're all out.
-Right?
(Youngjoon finally revealing that
he knows Myeongkyun)

686
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:33,240
(Youngjoon: It feels like lying if we act like we don't know each other.)
-They're all out.
-Right?
(Youngjoon finally revealing that
he knows Myeongkyun)

687
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,900
(Youngjoon: It feels like lying if we act like we don't know each other.)

688
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,180
(Minseon: How did you meet?
Youngjoon: Oh?)

689
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:41,900
(Myeongkyun: A long time ago.
Youngjoon: A long time ago... Well...)

690
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,100
(We used to contact each other and know each other's Instagram...)
(Ah...)

691
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,180
(Youngjoon: It's been three years, right? Two to three years.)

692
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:52,100
(Youngjoon: As I expected, the question I was worried about, "How do you know each other?"

693
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,180
(Youngjoon: Was asked by Minseon.)

694
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,260
(Youngjoon: I wanted to discuss how to answer this at first,)

695
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,290
(Youngjoon: so I took the initiative to talk (to Myeongkyun).)

696
00:31:59,290 --> 00:31:59,380
So I took the initiative to talk.
(Youngjoon: so I took the initiative to talk (to Myeongkyun).)

697
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,210
(Youngjoon: But we got asked even before we discussed it.)
So I took the initiative to talk.

698
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,620
(Youngjoon: But we got asked even before we discussed it.)

699
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,780
(Youngjoon: So I feel like I wasn't able to answer properly.)

700
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,100
(Minseon: I couldn't tell.)

701
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,580
(Minseon: I did think "they look pretty close,")

702
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,020
(Minseon: but I was more curious about how they met each other

703
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:17,260
(Minseon: and why they know each other.)

704
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,700
(Youngjoon: That's why I told him from the beginning.)

705
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,220
(Youngjoon: The fact that I was unforgiving to him was because we knew each other.)

706
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,300
(Minseon: Oh, really? That makes sense then.)

707
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:24,940
I'm not someone who does that to someone I just met.

708
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,980
(Youngjoon: I'm not someone who does that to someone I just met.)
(You are)
I'm not someone who does that to someone I just met.

709
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,340
-That's right.
-You're someone like this.
(Youngjoon: I'm not someone who does that to someone I just met.)
(You are)

710
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,860
(You are, you are)
(No)

711
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,940
(Minseon: Who should I believe?
Youngjoon: Believe what you see.)

712
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,230
(Minseon: Just trust myself?
Youngjoon: Trust yourself.)

713
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,180
-Got it.
-Nah, it's all fake.
(Minseon: Just trust myself?
Youngjoon: Trust yourself.)

714
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,220
-Got it.
-Nah, it's all fake.

715
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:36,810
(No, it's all fake)
-Got it.
-Nah, it's all fake.

716
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,180
Trust yourself.
(No, it's all fake)

717
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,470
(Youngjoon: You're the only person you can trust in the world.)

718
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,400
Yes.
(Youngjoon: You're the only person you can trust in the world.)

719
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:45,170
(Myeongkyun: It feels more like if I were to go "eh?" when he first saw me, I'd go "yeah!")

720
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:45,860
-Right. -But I can't do that on my own accord.
(Myeongkyun: It feels more like if I were to go "eh?" when he first saw me, I'd go "yeah!")

721
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,950
-Right. -But I can't do that on my own accord.

722
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,760
You might not want that.

723
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,900
Yes.

724
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,740
(Youngjoon: So, as I just talked to you about,)

725
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,200
(Youngjoon: every time I talk to Myeongkyu, Hanmin would follow.)

726
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,020
So... So the two of us...
(Youngjoon: every time I talk to Myeongkyu, Hanmin would follow.)

727
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,310
So... So the two of us...

728
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,500
(Youngjoon: From Hanmin's points of view, he's someone who came to Men's house later, and is someone we met for the first time.)

729
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,380
-That's right.
-But we kept talking...
(Youngjoon: From Hanmin's points of view, he's someone who came to Men's house later, and is someone we met for the first time.)

730
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,030
(Youngjoon: But we kept talking among just the two of us somewhere. So I thought about what he would think.)
-That's right.
-But we kept talking...

731
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,710
Among just the two of us somewhere.
(Youngjoon: But we kept talking among just the two of us somewhere. So I thought about what he would think.)

732
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,530
-So I thought about what he would think.
-Yeah.
(Youngjoon: But we kept talking among just the two of us somewhere. So I thought about what he would think.)

733
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,260
(Youngjoon: But we kept talking among just the two of us somewhere. So I thought about what he would think.)

734
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:17,860
(Youngjoon: When I was talking about that, I don't know if I was shying away a little,)

735
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:21,700
(Youngjoon: I wasn't able to properly look at Hanmin's face.)

736
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,340
(Hanmin: I didn't notice it at all.)

737
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:28,500
(Hanmin: They said they were just friends.)

738
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,420
(Jaeseung and Seongmin who are on their way to the secret date venue)

739
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,590
I've always wanted to go on a date with you.
(Jaeseung and Seongmin who are on their way to the secret date venue)

740
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,580
-That's great. That this happened.
-Yeah.
(Jaeseung and Seongmin who are on their way to the secret date venue)

741
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,620
-That's great. That this happened.
-Yeah.

742
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:35,640
(Jaeseung: You're curious why we're on a date like this, right?
Seongmin: Yeah.)
-That's great. That this happened.
-Yeah.

743

-That this happened.
-You're curious why we're on
(Jaeseung: You're curious why we're on a date like this, right?
Seongmin: Yeah.)

744
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,590
-a date like this, right?
-Yeah.
(Jaeseung: You're curious why we're on a date like this, right?
Seongmin: Yeah.)

745
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,880
Today?
(Jaeseung: You're curious why we're on a date like this, right?
Seongmin: Yeah.)

746
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,740
(Seongmin: Today? Thinking about it,)

747
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:46,140
(Seongmin: I did say I wanted to go on a date with you yesterday.)

748
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:55,100
(Seongmin: He looked handsome from the side too, so my heart was fluttering.)

749
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:04,860
(Jaeseung: There's a privilege that's only given to me.
Seongmin: Is that so? Did you use it on me?)

750
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:10,420
(Jaeseung: I used my privilege on you.)

751
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,580
(Jaeseung: First, let me explain.)

752
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:13,940
The person with the most votes,

753
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,310
(Surprised)
(Jaeseong tells Seongmin about the secret mission)
The person with the most votes,

754
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,949
can get this privilege.
(Surprised)
(Jaeseong tells Seongmin about the secret mission)

755
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:19,100
-Really?
-Yes.

756
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,159
(Seongmin: Really? Yesterday?)
-Really?
-Yes.

757
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,870
-Yesterday? -Yesterday.
(Seongmin: Really? Yesterday?)

758
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:31,500
(Jaeseung: It's a privilege that the person who got the most votes during the call time can get.)

759
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,340
(Seongmin: It's an honor.)

760
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,100
(Jaeseung: If I were on the receiving end, I might get flustered.)

761
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,100
(Jaeseung: To relieve this kind of confusion,)

762
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,780
(Jaeseung: I think everything should be in order.)

763
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:51,620
(Jaeseung: I thought I should start with explaining (the secret mission).)

764
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:57,580
(Seongmin: Were you going to ask for a date with me?)

765
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,510
-Today? -Yes.
(Seongmin: Were you going to ask for a date with me?)

766
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:02,980
(Jaeseung: If I got the arrow card today, I would've asked to,)

767
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:08,980
(Jaeseung: But actually... Between arrow card and heart card,)

768
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:13,340
(Jaeseung: I would prefer to get a heart card more.)

769
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,380
(Seongmin: But I thought you were always interested in Hwi.)

770
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:21,220
(Jaeseung: But it's not wrong to say that I'm interested in Hwi.
Seongmin: Ah...)

771
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:26,420
(Jaeseung: I was interested in Hwi.
Seongmin: I see.)

772
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:30,060
(Jaeseung: So on the first day, and on the second day before a moment,)

773
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,020
(Jaeseung: I've always had more interest in Hwi.)

774
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,740
Really?

775
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:42,020
(Jaeseung: But anyway, I think one's interest can change.)

776
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,580
(Seongmin: Right. It's only been three days.)

777
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:47,260
(Jaeseung: It's only the third day.)

778
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:47,980
So now I'm just talking about my current situation.
(Jaeseung: It's only the third day.)

779
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,880
(Jaeseung: So now I'm just talking about my current situation.)
So now I'm just talking about my current situation.

780
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,380
-I don't want to hide these parts.
-Mm.
(Jaeseung: So now I'm just talking about my current situation.)

781
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,580
(Jaeseung: I don't want to hide these parts.)
-I don't want to hide these parts.
-Mm.

782
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:59,500
(As they were having the honest talk in the car, the sky starts getting dark)

783
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:03,820
(Jaeseung: We're here.)

784
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,180
(The two people's secret date venue,
a cafe with a beautiful view)

785
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,290
The weather is nice too.
(The two people's secret date venue,
a cafe with a beautiful view)

786
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:09,460
It's really nice.
(The two people's secret date venue,
a cafe with a beautiful view)

787
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,400
The view here is beautiful too.
(The two people's secret date venue,
a cafe with a beautiful view)

788
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,380
The backdrop is really beautiful.

789
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,940
(At dusk, the scenic date venue)

790
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,180
You can see it from there.
(At dusk, the scenic date venue)

791
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:16,760
(A beautiful day
at a beautiful place)
You can see it from there.

792
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,620
(A beautiful day
at a beautiful place)

793
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,270
Wait.

794
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:23,940
-The view is really beautiful.
-Yeah.

795
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,420
(Seongmin: The view is really beautiful.)
-The view is really beautiful.
-Yeah.

796
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,860
(Jaeseung: Isn't it nice?
Seongmin: Yes, totally.)

797
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,100
(Jaeseung: Did you have fun today?)

798
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:40,500
(Seongmin: I just shared an honest conversation with Seungjin.
Seongmin: An honest conversation?)

799
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,740
(Seongmin: I spoke sincerely with Seungjin.)

800
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,340
(Seongmin: We talked about life.)

801
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,250
(Seongmin: What did you do?)

802
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,140
I taught Hwi workouts.
(Seongmin: What did you do?)

803
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,920
(Jaeseung: I taught Hwi workouts.)
I taught Hwi workouts.

804
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,180
(Jaeseung: I taught Hwi workouts.)

805
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,830
(Jaeseung: We went to the pool and played with the water a for a little.)

806
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:53,900
You were a personal trainer for a day?
(Jaeseung: We went to the pool and played with the water a for a little.)

807
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,070
(Nodding)
(Seongmin: You were a personal trainer for a day?)
You were a personal trainer for a day?

808
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,260
(Nodding)
(Seongmin: You were a personal trainer for a day?)

809
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,020
(Thank you)

810
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,940
(Jaeseung: It looks delicious.
Seongmin: Amazing.)

811
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,660
(Seongmin: What did you order?
Jaeseung: Mine's orange juice.)

812
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,260
Can I put this like this?
(Seongmin: What did you order?
Jaeseung: Mine's orange juice.)

813
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:05,300
Can I put this like this?

814
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:05,770
(Busy)
Can I put this like this?

815
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:06,850
Let's change.
(Busy)

816
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:07,890
(Busy)

817
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,220
What should I do?
(Busy)

818
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:09,740
What should I do?

819
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,010
(Jaeseung: Are you nervous? Seongmin: I am nervous.)

820
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:14,930
Here.
(Jaeseung: Are you nervous? Seongmin: I am nervous.)

821
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:16,020
(Jaeseung: Are you nervous? Seongmin: I am nervous.)

822
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,270
(Jaeseung: It's really awkward.)

823
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,140
-Me. -Yeah you go first.
(Jaeseung: It's really awkward.)

824
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:21,320
(Seongmin: I thought you were handsome the first time I saw you.)
-Me. -Yeah you go first.
(Jaeseung: It's really awkward.)

825
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:26,340
(Seongmin: I thought you were handsome the first time I saw you.)

826
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,860
(Seongmin: I thought you were handsome. So I was happy.)

827
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:35,940
(Seongmin: I was quite out of it then. But thinking about it now...)

828
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:43,220
(Jaeseung: It feels like we haven't had the time to know each other well.)

829
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,080
(Seongmin: It was a situation where we couldn't talk much.)

830
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,700
-It's like I was at a loss for words.
-Right.
(Seongmin: It was a situation where we couldn't talk much.)

831
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:50,140
(Jaeseung: It's like I was at a loss for words.)
-It's like I was at a loss for words.
-Right.

832
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,380
(Jaeseung: It should've been a day where I just spoke anything.)

833
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:55,980
-I haven't sorted out what to say.
-Yes.
(Jaeseung: It should've been a day where I just spoke anything.)

834
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,380
(Jaeseung: I haven't sorted out what to say.)
-I haven't sorted out what to say.
-Yes.

835
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,780
(Jaeseung: We've never met each other before.)

836
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:09,580
(Jaeseung: But now we're quite familiar with each other, right? As compared to then.)

837
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:14,380
(Jaeseung: So I think we can share some deeper conversations)

838
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,740
(Jaeseung: now.)

839
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:21,980
(Seongmin: What kind of person do you like?
Jaeseung: What kind of person?)

840
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,780
(Jaeseung: Someone pure.
Seongmin: Someone pure?)

841
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:34,400
(Jaeseung: From a certain point, I feel like I started putting more emphasis on this.)

842
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:34,500
-That I'm like this and the other party too.
-Yes. At a certain age.
(Jaeseung: From a certain point, I feel like I started putting more emphasis on this.)

843
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,540
(Jaeseung: That I'm like this and the other party too.)
-That I'm like this and the other party too.
-Yes. At a certain age.

844
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,950
-That I'm like this and the other party too.
-Yes. At a certain age.

845
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:45,220
(Jaeseung: When I was young, I would do something with a pure heart)

846
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,060
(Jaeseung: that would then turn into passion and excitement.)

847
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:56,620
(Jaeseung: But now when my heart flutters and things become passionate, I feel like I trip over something and calm down.)

848
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:01,780
(Jaeseung: That, because of this obstacle, I keep thinking "this won't work, neither would that.")

849
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:06,260
(Jaeseung: There are moments like this where I can't help myself.)

850
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,980
(Jaeseung: And I can see these from the other party.)

851
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,900
(Jaeseung: Should I say it feels like a reality check?)

852
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,380
(Seongmin: But I feel the same.)

853
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:17,340
(Jaeseung: So I think, I really don't want to date.)

854
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:21,940
(Jaeseung: There was a moment where I thought "I don't want to date for now" because of this.)

855
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,080
(Seongmin: I'm almost 30 too, so I understand what you mean.)

856
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,740
But I think that's because...
(Seongmin: I'm almost 30 too, so I understand what you mean.)

857
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,270
(Seongmin: But I think that's because... I want to find someone I can date for a longer time.)
But I think that's because...

858
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:31,930
-I want to find someone I can date for a longer time.
-That's right.
(Seongmin: But I think that's because... I want to find someone I can date for a longer time.)

859
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:32,380
(Seongmin: But I think that's because... I want to find someone I can date for a longer time.)

860
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:38,100
(Seongmin: Actually, I joined Men's House cause I want to find a partner.)

861
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,500
(Seongmin: To be honest, I'm almost 30.)

862
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:47,740
(Seongmin: I don't want to enter a relationship that's going to end quickly easily.)

863
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,460
(Seongmin: I want to find someone who can accompany me

864
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,940
(Seongmin: like a partner for a longer time.)

865
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:58,140
(Seongmin: I think this is a very special experience.)

866
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,220
(Jaeseung: I think you're right.)

867
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:05,300
(Jaeseung: I think I've been looking for a partner too.)

868
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:14,660
(Jaeseung: I'm looking for something long-term, where it won't be easily abandoned.)

869
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,770
(Seongmin: Between humans,)

870
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:17,020
-Being abandoned is a very negative thing.
-That's right.
(Seongmin: Between humans,)

871
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:20,650
(Seongmin: Being abandoned is a very negative thing. It's sad.)
-Being abandoned is a very negative thing.
-That's right.

872
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,730
It's sad.
(Seongmin: Being abandoned is a very negative thing. It's sad.)

873
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,580
(Seongmin: Being abandoned is a very negative thing. It's sad.)

874
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,220
(Jaeseung: Someone that isn't like that.)

875
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,820
(Seongmin: The time? That you date for?)

876
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:33,260
(Jaeseung: Rather than someone that won't abandon,)

877
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,460
(Seongmin: it's more like I hope to find someone who doesn't even think of abandoning.)

878
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,620
(Seongmin: Someone who doesn't break up?)

879
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:46,500
(Jaeseung: Someone who doesn't break up easily.)

880
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,340
(Seongmin: Ah, I get what you mean.)

881
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,020
(Jaeseung: Someone who doesn't do things too easily.)

882
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,380
(Seongmin: But it's difficult to find someone like that.)

883
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:01,580
(Jaeseung: In Men's House, Seongmin showed a more playful side of himself.)

884
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:06,820
(Jaeseung: On this date, I saw more sides of him being more serious.)

885
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:15,500
(Jaeseung: His lifestyle? How he treats other people, his attitude, and his values.)

886
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:20,700
(Jaeseung: I think we are quite similar in these things.)

887
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:32,260
(Seongmin: Have you been interested in anyone other than Hui in Men's House? Other than Hui and I.)

888
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:36,900
(Jaeseung: Rather than the feeling of "I want to date this person once cause I am interested in them,"

889
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,260
(Jaeseung: there are people I want to try going on dates with.)

890
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,860
(Seongmin: Who is it? Can I ask?)

891
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:48,820
(Jaeseung: Hmm... Youngjoon.)

892
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,550
(Seongmin: Youngjoon? Ah, Youngjoon is younger than me. Youngjoon?
Jaeseung: Youngjoon.)

893
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,600
Youngjoon.
(Seongmin: Youngjoon? Ah, Youngjoon is younger than me. Youngjoon?
Jaeseung: Youngjoon.)

894
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,860
(Seongmin: Youngjoon? Ah, Youngjoon is younger than me. Youngjoon?
Jaeseung: Youngjoon.)

895
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,740
(Seongmin: Ah, I see.)

896
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,020
(Seongmin: I had no idea.)

897
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,980
(Seongmin: I didn't know you were interested in him.)

898
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,820
(Jaeseung: Rather than saying interested... I'm not that interested.)

899
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:07,180
(Jaeseung: Just quite literally, I want to try going on a date with him.)

900
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:11,620
(Jaeseung: The reason is simple.)

901
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:18,620
(Jaeseung: Youngjoon is very different from me. Personality-wise.
Seongmin: Oh, feels like it.)

902
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:22,500
(Jaeseung: From a certain angle, I feel that we have a similar personality.
Seongmin: I think so.)

903
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,100
(Jaeseung: At a certain level.
Seongmin: I get you.)

904
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:30,380
(Jaeseung: So it's more like curiosity.)

905
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,300
(Jaeseung: I don't know if it's an interest.)

906
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:38,510
(Seongmin: In Men's House, honestly,)

907
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:38,660
I'm only, literally curious, about Hwi and you.
(Seongmin: In Men's House, honestly,)

908
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,990
(Seongmin: I'm only, literally curious, about Hwi and you.
Jaeseung: Literally just curious.)
I'm only, literally curious, about Hwi and you.

909
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:45,110
-Literally just curious. -So...
(Seongmin: I'm only, literally curious, about Hwi and you.
Jaeseung: Literally just curious.)

910
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:45,900
(Seongmin: I'm only, literally curious, about Hwi and you.
Jaeseung: Literally just curious.)

911
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:50,500
(Seongmin: But I'm lucky to have a date with Hwi today and also you.)

912
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:54,980
(Seongmin: But as I have gone on a date with both of you, I realize...)

913
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,740
(Seongmin: Hwi and you are really different.)

914
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,620
(Jaeseung: I'm different from Hwi?
Seongmin: Completely different.)

915
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:04,920
(Jaeseung: I went on a date with Hwi today too.
Seongmin: Right?)

916
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,820
-So I...
-It looks like we can all go on a date...
(Jaeseung: I went on a date with Hwi today too.
Seongmin: Right?)

917
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,500
(Jaeseung: It looks like we can all go on a date with everyone once.)
-So I...
-It looks like we can all go on a date...

918
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,260
-I think it's too...
-With everyone once.
(Jaeseung: It looks like we can all go on a date with everyone once.)

919
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,540
(Seongmin: No, wouldn't that make it really complicated to look at?)

920
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,380
(Ha...)

921
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,860
(Jaeseung: Why are you sighing?)

922
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:22,780
(Seongmin: I suddenly thought of Hwi.)

923
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,020
(Seongmin: I just thought of Hwi.)

924
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:32,340
(Seongmin: That if he were here, at this cafe with a beautiful view, what would we talk about?)

925
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:35,100
(Seongmin: When I said the view is great,)

926
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:39,980
(Seongmin: I thought, would we talk about more things?)

927
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:46,780
(Seongmin: Don't you want to take that? The yacht-like thing.
Jaeseung: The yacht?)

928
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,300
(Jaeseung: Will there be water activities on the dates?)

929
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,900
(Seongmin: I can't do that. Do you like extreme sports?)

930
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:56,260
(Jaeseung: I think I can do it if I'm told to.
Seongmin: Really?)

931
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:59,380
(Seongmin: I've been so happy until now.)

932
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,940
(Seongmin: But suddenly talking about "you have to fall into the water" makes it difficult.)

933
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,940
(Jaeseung: Speaking of that, it's a little like...)

934
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,660
(Jaeseung: The date you and I want to have are completely, different.)

935
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:14,100
(Seongmin: Really? What do you want?)

936
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:18,260
(Jaeseung: When you first mentioned going to the museum on the first day...
Seongmin: Mm.)

937
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:24,980
(Jaeseung: I actually went to a museum before. But I dozed off.
Seongmin: Really?)

938
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,420
(Seongmin: Why? You don't like museums?)

939
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,460
(Jaeseung: It's not that I don't like it.)

940
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:35,580
(Jaeseung: It's more like I was thinking what I should think about when I'm looking at these and I dozed off.)

941
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:39,060
(Seongmin: That's a difference in our perspectives.
Jaeseung: Something like that.)

942
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,940
(Seongmin: Being different can also be attractive.)

943
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:45,420
(Seongmin: So that's what you think.)

944
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:52,340
(Seongmin: I thought, if I go on a date with Jaeseung somewhere else, would it be fun?)

945
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:59,300
(Seongmin: The more we talked, the more we realized our hobbies are different.)

946
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,860
(Seongmin: And I didn't really know if I resonate with what he told me.)

947
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:12,780
(Seongmin: "Is the conversation going well? The flow seems to have been broken," I had thoughts like this.)

948
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,230
(The night has come)

949
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:16,240
The weather is really nice.
(The night has come)

950
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,290
I'll never forget this night.
(The night has come)

951
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:30,100
(The secret mission date is over,
please return to Men's House.)

952
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:36,220
(Jaeseung: It says that our secret date is over.
Seongmin: What a pity.)

953
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,620
(Jaeseung, we should go. Seongmin: Where to?)

954
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:42,420
(Seongmin: Somewhere else?(

955
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,300
(Seongmin: We're going somewhere else, right?)

956
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:49,260
(Jaeseung: I started to like Seongmin more after the date.)

957
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:58,180
(Jaeseung: He's innocent and likes smiling. I'm attracted to his puppy-like appearance.)

958
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,820
(Jaeseung: It says we have to return to Men's House.
Seongmin: All right...)

959
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,820
(Seongmin: Let's go.)

960
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,800
Let's go.

961
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:11,260
(A moment that feels regretful even though they are together)

962
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,260
-But it's really nice here, right?
-Yeah.

963
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,020
I will come again.

964
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:16,300
("The two men's sudden and secret date")
I will come again.

965
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,870
-I'll come again if I can.
-Come again.
("The two men's sudden and secret date")

966
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:19,640
I'll really make the trip down.
("The two men's sudden and secret date")

967
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,930
Come again next time.
("The two men's sudden and secret date")

968
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:22,340
("The two men's sudden and secret date")

969
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:26,420
(Men's House at this hour)

970
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:32,460
(Seungjin is lying alone by the pool)

971
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,980
(Seungjin: I thought a lot today.)

972
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:40,100
(Seungjin: I may not look like it, but I have a low self-esteem.)

973
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:43,700
(Seungjin: I realized that I've been eating away at my self-esteem.)

974
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,900
(Seungjin: I'm angry at this situation.)

975
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,460
(Seungjin: "If this is what I'm going to do, why did I bother coming on this?" I can't stop thinking about that.)

976
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:54,560
(Seungjin: "I've been too relaxed." I keep having thoughts like this.)

977
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:54,740
-Cheers. -Cheers.
(Seungjin: "I've been too relaxed." I keep having thoughts like this.)

978
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:54,940
-Cheers. -Cheers.

979
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:55,770
(Minseon, Myeongkyun, and Hanmin who are having snacks
at the kitchen)
-Cheers. -Cheers.

980
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:56,450
Cheers.
(Minseon, Myeongkyun, and Hanmin who are having snacks
at the kitchen)

981
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:57,540
Cheers to the three of us.
(Minseon, Myeongkyun, and Hanmin who are having snacks
at the kitchen)

982
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,140
Three people, three colors.
(Minseon, Myeongkyun, and Hanmin who are having snacks
at the kitchen)

983
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,820
(Minseon: Night dates must be fun.)

984
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:04,230
(Myeongkyun: But I still don't understand.)

985
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:05,350
What?
(Myeongkyun: But I still don't understand.)

986
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:05,820
(Myeongkyun: But I still don't understand.)

987
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:09,040
(Myeongkyun: Seongmin and Jaeseung.)

988
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:09,800
Still...
(Myeongkyun: Seongmin and Jaeseung.)

989
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,780
(Minseon: They both called each other yesterday.)

990
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:20,210
(Minseon: I think it's true that Jaeseung picked the date himself.
Hanmin: I think so too.)

991
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:21,090
I think so too.
(Minseon: I think it's true that Jaeseung picked the date himself.
Hanmin: I think so too.)

992
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:23,100
(Minseon: I think it's true that Jaeseung picked the date himself.
Hanmin: I think so too.)

993
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,380
(Minseon: Why did you choose Youngjoon?)

994
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,340
(Hanmin: Yours was an arrow card, right?)

995
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,480
Yes.
(Hanmin: Yours was an arrow card, right?)

996
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:31,220
(Hanmin: First of all, we are the same age.)

997
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:35,180
(Hanmin: I want to go on a date with him.)

998
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,500
(Hanmin: We can't date if our cards overlapped.)

999
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,020
Yes.
(Hanmin: We can't date if our cards overlapped.)

1000
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,100
So I carefully selected the card. Fortunately, I chose it.
(Hanmin: We can't date if our cards overlapped.)

1001
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:46,330
(Hanmin: So I carefully selected the card. Fortunately, I chose (a different card).)
So I carefully selected the card. Fortunately, I chose it.

1002
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:46,980
(Hanmin: So I carefully selected the card. Fortunately, I chose (a different card).)

1003
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:47,460
Although they say that,

1004
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,620
(Myeongkyun: Although they (Hanmin & Youngjoon) say that,)
Although they say that,

1005
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:50,900
(Myeongkyun: do they really like each other?)

1006
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,900
(Myeongkyun: No, 100%.)

1007
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:57,100
(Minggyun: I think they just think it's fun and they are friends, that's why they're enjoying it.)

1008
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,900
(Myeongkyun: I think that's all.)

1009
00:47:59,070 --> 00:47:59,100
You're here.

1010
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,000
(Seungjin who's done with his self-reflection (?)
joins in)
You're here.

1011
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,660
-I feel like I'm getting sick of it.
-Feels nice.
(Seungjin who's done with his self-reflection (?)
joins in)

1012
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:03,060
(Seungjin who's done with his self-reflection (?)
joins in)

1013
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,460
-What's going on?
-Beer?
(Seungjin who's done with his self-reflection (?)
joins in)

1014
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:05,070
(Joking)
(I didn't say hello to Seungjin's eyebrows today)

1015
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:07,800
I didn't say hello to Seungjin's eyebrows today.
(Joking)
(I didn't say hello to Seungjin's eyebrows today)

1016
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,380
(Joking)
(I didn't say hello to Seungjin's eyebrows today)

1017
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,300
(Eyebrows that are under his hat)

1018
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:15,500
(Seungjin's snack, banana)

1019
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,300
(Minseon: Bananas again?)

1020
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,470
(Minseon: I think you ate all the bananas.)

1021
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:23,730
What? You startled me.
(Minseon: I think you ate all the bananas.)

1022
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:26,540
(Minseon: Want some fruit? Myeongkyun: Fruits?)

1023
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:29,860
(Minseon: Shall we cut some fruits and have it?
Myeongkyun: Should I cut it for you?)

1024
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:29,890
(Minseon: I want to eat apples. Are there still apples?)

1025
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:32,110
-I want to eat apples. -Apples?
(Minseon: I want to eat apples. Are there still apples?)

1026
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:37,460
(Myeongkyun cuts apples for Minseon himself)

1027
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:39,180
(Myeongkyun: Do you eat it with the skin on?
Minseon: I'm fine with anything.)

1028
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,660
(Myeongkyun: Is that so? That's good.)

1029
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,780
(Somehow anxious)

1030
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,160
(Ah!)

1031
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:48,620
Are you okay?
(Ah!)

1032
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,210
Are you okay?

1033
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:49,970
Are you okay?

1034
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,860
(Minseon: Did you cut your hand?
Myeongkyun: I'm fine.

1035
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:52,940
(Minseon: I think you're bleeding though?)

1036
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:54,940
-I think you're bleeding though?
-He's bleeding.
(Minseon: I think you're bleeding though?)

1037
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,800
I'm fine. I just have to wipe it.
(Minseon: I think you're bleeding though?)

1038
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,060
Let me see.

1039
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:57,680
(The wound seems to be cut deep)
Let me see.

1040
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,600
(The wound seems to be cut deep)

1041
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,840
Hold on. Thank you. Thank you.
(The wound seems to be cut deep)

1042
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,200
Is the wound deep?
(The wound seems to be cut deep)

1043
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,740
(Minseon rushes up to the second floor)

1044
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:11,860
(Looking around)

1045
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,030
(Minseon gives Myeongkyun antiseptic cream and band-aid)

1046
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:19,160
Oh, so considerate.
(Minseon gives Myeongkyun antiseptic cream and band-aid)

1047
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,060
(Minseon: Come over.)

1048
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:22,260
It's not good, right?

1049
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,090
(Careful)
It's not good, right?

1050
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:23,830
(Careful)

1051
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:25,730
-Perhaps.
-Really?
(Careful)

1052
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:26,570
(Careful)

1053
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:28,630
I'm bleeding more than I thought I'd.
(Careful)

1054
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:33,100
(Minseon: Are you bleeding a lot?
Myeongkyun: Not anymore.)

1055
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:37,860
(Minseon: Try to see if your thumbs feel uncomfortable when bent.
Myeongkyun: It's fine.)

1056
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,740
(Myeongkyun: Because I'm left-handed.)

1057
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:46,990
(Myeongkyun: Don't worry.
Minseon: Then don't make me worry, sir.)

1058
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:47,940
Nah.
(Myeongkyun: Don't worry.
Minseon: Then don't make me worry, sir.)

1059
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:52,620
(Touched)

1060
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:56,940
(Double room
Hwi,
Seongmin)

1061
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:02,220
(Hwi is alone in a double room without Seongmin)

1062
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:11,300
(Time seems to pass slowly when he's alone)

1063
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:18,380
(Hwi pauses at the photo of Jaeseung he took today)

1064
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,980
(Hwi: I thought I had a good day today.)

1065
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:23,500
(Hwi: I felt betrayed.)

1066
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,460
(Hwi: Ah... How could you do that?)

1067
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,980
(Hwi: I'm a little frustrated now.)

1068
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:27,130
(Hwi: I want to delete the (Jaeseung's) photo.)

1069
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:28,590
I want to delete the photo.
(Hwi: I want to delete the (Jaeseung's) photo.)

1070
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:30,820
(Hwi: I want to delete the (Jaeseung's) photo.)

1071
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,830
(Knock knock)

1072
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:39,900
What?
(Knock knock)

1073
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:40,660
What?

1074
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:41,100
-Why?
-What are you doing?

1075
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:41,820
(Seungjin: What are you doing?)
-Why?
-What are you doing?

1076
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:44,500
(Hwi: Are they looking for me?
Seungjin: No. I just didn't see you.)

1077
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,820
Hwi, come in.

1078
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:52,140
(Seungjin: Are you asleep?
Hwi: Just lying in bed.)

1079
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:57,900
(Seungjin: Are you okay?
Hwi: Yes. I'm fine.)

1080
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:58,860
Really?
(Seungjin: Are you okay?
Hwi: Yes. I'm fine.)

1081
00:50:58,860 --> 00:50:59,980
(Seungjin: Are you okay?
Hwi: Yes. I'm fine.)

1082
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,180
(Hwi: You're speaking like a robot.
Seungjin: Yeah.)

1083
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:07,060
(Hwi: Lie down and talk. Seungjin: It's nice.)

1084
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,260
(Seungjin: Who are you going to call today?)

1085
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,260
(Seungjin: To Seongmin, right?)

1086
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:15,500
(Hwi: Up till yesterday, I could press the phone number without hesitation.)

1087
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,700
(Hwi: Ah, but thinking about today, it's too...)

1088
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,260
(Hwi: That if I’m persistent... Would it)

1089
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,740
(Hwi: be burdensome to him?)

1090
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,940
(Seungjin: Why are you conflicted about this?)

1091
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:33,140
(Seungjin: I said to be more perseverant! Huh?)

1092
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:38,380
(Seungjin: Who should I call today?)

1093
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,820
(Seungjin: Jaeseung?)

1094
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:42,280
(Jaeseung and Seongmin who are back at Men's House
after the secret date)

1095
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,020
Are you okay?
(Jaeseung and Seongmin who are back at Men's House
after the secret date)

1096
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:43,420
(Jaeseung and Seongmin who are back at Men's House
after the secret date)

1097
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:44,160
Are you okay?
(Jaeseung and Seongmin who are back at Men's House
after the secret date)

1098
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,030
Right?
(Jaeseung and Seongmin who are back at Men's House
after the secret date)

1099
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:46,110
I'm fine.
(Jaeseung and Seongmin who are back at Men's House
after the secret date)

1100
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:47,700
It's a secret.

1101
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,420
(Seongmin: Keep our date a secret?)
It's a secret.

1102
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,040
(Seongmin: Keep our date a secret?)

1103
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,300
Keep our date a secret?
(Seongmin: Keep our date a secret?)

1104
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:50,610
(What kind of influence will their secret date bring?)

1105
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:51,740
Don't say anything.
(What kind of influence will their secret date bring?)

1106
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:52,370
(What kind of influence will their secret date bring?)

1107
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:54,420
-Be careful.
-I had fun today.
(What kind of influence will their secret date bring?)

1108
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,340
(What kind of influence will their secret date bring?)

1109
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,370
(Seongmin is finally here)

1110
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:58,460
-You're back.
-Where did you go?
(Seongmin is finally here)

1111
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:58,770
(Seungjin: Hello.)
-You're back.
-Where did you go?
(Seongmin is finally here)

1112
00:51:58,770 --> 00:51:59,320
(Seungjin: Hello.)

1113
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,390
Where did you go?
(Seungjin: Hello.)

1114
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:01,050
(Seungjin: Hello.)

1115
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:01,180
-Where did you go?
-What did you do?
(Seungjin: Hello.)

1116
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:03,540
(Hwi: Where did you go?)
-Where did you go?
-What did you do?

1117
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,740
(Seongmin: I will tell you in a week.)

1118
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:07,260
(Hwi: In a week?)

1119
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,020
(Seungjin: What...)

1120
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,370
(Seongmin: We really just went out.)

1121
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:11,500
In a week...
(Seongmin: We really just went out.)

1122
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,620
(Hwi: I asked him where he went.)

1123
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:14,460
(Hwi: But he didn't tell me.)

1124
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:19,340
(Hwi: So I felt more conflicted.)

1125
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:20,660
(Hwi: Why a week later?)

1126
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:20,900
-Why one week later?
-Yeah.
(Hwi: Why a week later?)

1127
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:21,020
(Seungmin: Yeah. Why so many days later? Why one week later?)
-Why one week later?
-Yeah.
(Hwi: Why a week later?)

1128
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:23,700
Why so many days later? Why one week later?
(Seungmin: Yeah. Why so many days later? Why one week later?)

1129
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,180
(Seongmin: Because it'll be over in a week.)

1130
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,370
I guess.

1131
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:35,420
(Hwi who's really upset about
Seongmin keeping the secret)

1132
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:39,640
Until then, I thought we're quite a good match–

1133
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,100
Is it call time?

1134
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:42,410
(Call time starts now.
Please call the person you're interested in and convey your feelings within 30 seconds.)

1135
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:43,570
Oh right.
(Call time starts now.
Please call the person you're interested in and convey your feelings within 30 seconds.)

1136
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:44,650
-I told you. -What?
(Call time starts now.
Please call the person you're interested in and convey your feelings within 30 seconds.)

00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:45,990
It's call time.
(Call time starts now.
Please call the person you're interested in and convey your feelings within 30 seconds.)

1138
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:46,860
Really?
(Call time starts now.
Please call the person you're interested in and convey your feelings within 30 seconds.)

1139
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:47,620
(Call time starts now.
Please call the person you're interested in and convey your feelings within 30 seconds.)

1140
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:51,420
(Seungjin: I'm staying here today.
Hwi: Stay here.)

1141
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,670
Who should I call?

1142
00:52:56,180 --> 00:53:03,060
(The call time that has come back
to the confused men)

1143
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:08,580
(Where are the men's hearts facing tonight?)

1144
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:13,980
(Jaeseung is waiting for the call time alone)

1145
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:16,300
(Jaeseung: I'm not prepared to share)

1146
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,940
(Jaeseung: who I'm going to call)

1147
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:25,700
(Jaeseung: and who I got a call from yet.)

1148
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:27,820
After the date, I felt complicated.

1149
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:30,820
(Seongmin: After the date (with Jaeseung), I felt complicated.)
After the date, I felt complicated.

1150
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,740
(Seongmin: I need time to collect my thoughts.)

1151
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:37,390
(Seongmin: But it was call time immediately. I was really confused.)

1152
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:37,700
Lie down.
(Seongmin: But it was call time immediately. I was really confused.)

1153
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,540
Lie down.

1154
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:39,690
I'm so tired.

1155
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:41,100
Can I use your blanket?

1156
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,660
(Seungjin who decides to be in the room with Hwi and Seungjin during the call time)
Can I use your blanket?

1157
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:43,230
(Seungjin who decides to be in the room with Hwi and Seungjin during the call time)

1158
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:44,120
Yes, its' fine.
(Seungjin who decides to be in the room with Hwi and Seungjin during the call time)

1159
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:44,580
(Seungjin who decides to be in the room with Hwi and Seungjin during the call time)

1160
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,420
(Seongmin: You know it's call time, right?
Seungjin: Yeah.)

1161
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:51,660
(Seongmin: I wanted to be alone today though.)

1162
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,180
(Seongmin: Seungjin was lying down on my bed,)

1163
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,620
(Seongmin: and Hwi was on the other side, which all made me really uncomfortable.)

1164
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:56,740
Because of the invisible vibes between the two of them...
(Seongmin: and Hwi was on the other side, which all made me really uncomfortable.)

1165
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:57,140

00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:59,420
(Seungjin: Because of the invisible vibes between Hwi and Seongmin...)
Because of the invisible vibes between the two of them...

1167
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:03,220
(Seungjin: I'm just looking at them happily.)

1168
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:06,940
(Seungjin: It's like a couple who had a fight.)

1169
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:10,500
(Seungjin: How do you feel about having two dates today?
Hwi: Oh right.)

1170
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,660
(Seongmin: No. I said it wasn't a date.)

1171
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,740
(Seongmin: It was not a date.)

1172
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,980
(Seungjin: Were you kidnapped, then?)

1173
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,820
(Seongmin: We just went out for a spin.)

1174
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:20,620
(What do you mean? That is a date!)

1175
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:26,260
(Seongmin: We went to a venue. And that venue was outdoors. Shocked, right?
Seungjin: Ah, outdoors?)

1176
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,060
No, in any way, you went on an outdoor date.

1177
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,660
(Seungjin: No, in any way, you went on an outdoor date.)
No, in any way, you went on an outdoor date.

1178
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:29,940
(Panic)
(Seungjin's sharp (?) questions keep coming)

1179
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:33,270
It's just outside.
(Panic)
(Seungjin's sharp (?) questions keep coming)

1180
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,940
(Panic)
(Seungjin's sharp (?) questions keep coming)

1181
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:37,340
(Seungjin: Did you go outside? Was it out of Earth?)

1182
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,310
That's funny.
(Seungjin: Did you go outside? Was it out of Earth?)

1183
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:40,220
(Seungjin: Did you go outside? Was it out of Earth?)

1184
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:40,440
(On the other side,
Youngjoon and Hanmin are alone in a room)

1185
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,380
Where could Seongmin be?
(On the other side,

1334
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:09,180
(Who should I call..?)

1335
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:12,300
(Seungjin: I've never been this stuck before.)

1336
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:23,300
(Who is the person Seungjin is calling?)

1337
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:30,020
(Hwi: Have you decided? Who you're going to call?)

1338
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:32,820
(Hwi: I think I'm 80 percent sure.)

1339
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:36,940
(Seongmin: Who are you going to call?)

1340
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:38,220
(Hwi: Who do you think I'll call?)

1341
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:41,260
(Seongmin: Someone you like.)

1342
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:43,460
(Hwi: Someone I like... yeah...)

1343
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,090
(Seongmin: Oh, wait. -Hwi: What?)

1344
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:47,140
Hello?
(Seongmin: Oh, wait. -Hwi: What?)

1345
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:47,180
Hello?

1346
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,330
(Seungjin calls his date today, Seongmin)
Hello?

1347
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:51,240
(Seungjin calls his date today, Seongmin)

1348
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:51,860
Wait.
(Seungjin calls his date today, Seongmin)

1349
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:52,470
Wait.

1350
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:55,900
(Seongmin: I did not expect it at all)

1351
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:56,820
I became even more confused at the time.

1352
01:02:56,820 --> 01:03:00,070
(Hwi: I became even more confused at the time.)
I became even more confused at the time.

1353
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:00,620
(Hwi: I became even more confused at the time.)

1354
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:04,500
(Hwi: People's thoughts are hard to guess.)

1355
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:10,240
(Seungjin: I seem to have gotten closer to you since yesterday)

1356
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,970
I feel comfortable around you.
(Seungjin: I seem to have gotten closer to you since yesterday)

1357
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:17,260
(Seungjin: Thank you for today and have a good night.)

1358
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:22,060
(Okay~)

1359
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:29,860
(Seungjin chose Seongmin tonight.)

1360
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:43,380
(Seungjin: First of all, I'm just really satisfied with today's date.)

1361
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:46,540
(Seungjin: The biggest reason why I called was)

1362
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:50,460
(Seungjin: the people I'm slightly interested in)

1363
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:54,740
(Seungjin: all found their other half already)

1364
01:03:55,340 --> 01:04:00,780
(Seungjin: so I didn't want to interfere and disturb them.)

1365
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:05,820
(Because of the unexpected call from Seungjin, Hwi and Seongmin are confused)

1366
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:06,760
Was it Seungjin?
(Because of the unexpected call from Seungjin, Hwi and Seongmin are confused)

1367
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,020
(Because of the unexpected call from Seungjin, Hwi and Seongmin are confused)

1368
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:11,700
(Seongmin: I really didn't expect this.)

1369
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:16,460
(Seongmin: Wait...)

1370
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,820
(Seongmin: I'm a little flustered.)

1371
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:22,020
(Seongmin: I'm thankful for Seungjin,)

1372
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:25,420
(Seongmin: but I'm not interested in Seungjin romantically.)

1373
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:29,140
(Seongmin: 'Do I need to hurt him unintentionally?')

1374
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:32,260
(Seongmin: 'Am I doing something wrong?' was what I thought.)

1375
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:36,100
(Seongmin: I feel complicated.)

1376
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:40,860
(Seongmin: Wait... I actually feel really flustered right now.)

1377
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:46,740
(Seongmin: What should I do? Ah... wait...)

1378
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:51,380
(Hwi: Did I say something wrong to Seungjin?)

1379
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:59,740
(Hwi: I think I told him everything too casually, like about what was bothering me.)

1380
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:02,900
Why? Did something happen?

1381
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,620
(Why? Did something happen? *Pretending to not know*)
Why? Did something happen?

1382
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:05,460
(Why? Did something happen? *Pretending to not know*)

1383
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:07,140
(Why? Did something happen?)

1384
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:08,460
(Seongmin: You...)

1385
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:09,100
(Seungjin: Why? What?)

1386
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:10,660
(Seongmin: Nothing, nothing.)

1387
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:11,830
(-Seungjin: Why? Why? Why? -Seongmin: Nothing, nothing.)

1388
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:12,020
Why? Why? Why?
(-Seungjin: Why? Why? Why? -Seongmin: Nothing, nothing.)

1389
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:12,320
(Seongmin: You're asking what happened?)
Why? Why? Why?
(-Seungjin: Why? Why? Why? -Seongmin: Nothing, nothing.)

1390
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,540
(Seongmin: You're asking what happened?)

1391
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:15,220
(Seongmin: Has your mind been reset?)

1392
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:17,020
(Seungjin: What? What? What?)

1393
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:17,740
(Why? Why? Why?)

1394
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:19,420
(Why? Why? Why?)

1395
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:19,970
(What? What? What?)

1396
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:21,140
-What? What? What? -Nothing. What?
(What? What? What?)

1397
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:21,620
-What? What? What? -Nothing. What?

1398
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:23,230
(Their heads are full of question marks)

1399
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:24,230
What? What? What?
(Their heads are full of question marks)

1400
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:25,900
(Their heads are full of question marks)

1401
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:29,300
(Ha...)

1402
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:36,400
(Hwi: Do we have to stay in our rooms during call time?)

1403
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:36,500
-What’s wrong? -Nothing, nothing.
(Hwi: Do we have to stay in our rooms during call time?)

1404
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,380
(Seungjin: What's wrong?)
-What’s wrong? -Nothing, nothing.

1405
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:43,100
(-Seungjin: Do you want me to leave? -Hwi. No, no, no.)

1406
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,900
(-Hwi: I'm just kidding, just kidding. -Seungjin: Do you want me to leave?)

1407
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,740
(Hwi: I'm just kidding~ just kidding~)

1408
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:46,780
-I should leave. -No, no, don't go.
(Hwi: I'm just kidding~ just kidding~)

1409
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:47,300
(Seungjin: I should leave.)
-I should leave. -No, no, don't go.

1410
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:47,580
-I should leave. -No, no, don't go.

1411
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:48,870
(Getting up at once, Hwi: No, no, don't go. -Seongmin: Where are you going?)
-I should leave. -No, no, don't go.

1412
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:49,340
-Where are you going? -Don't go.
(Getting up at once, Hwi: No, no, don't go. -Seongmin: Where are you going?)

1413
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:49,610
(Seungjin: I'm going to lie next to him.)
-Where are you going? -Don't go.
(Getting up at once, Hwi: No, no, don't go. -Seongmin: Where are you going?)

1414
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:51,940
-I'm going to lie next to him. -Okay, okay.
(Seungjin: I'm going to lie next to him.)

1415
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:54,580
(Hwi: Oh, wait, this...)

1416
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:55,700
(Seungjin: Let's get closer together.)

1417
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:58,820
(-Hwi: Okay, let's get closer. -Seungjin: Today, we...)

1418
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:01,820
(Seungjin: We talked a lot today.)

1419
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:04,220
(Hwi: Yeah we talked really seriously. -Seungjin: Yeah~)

1420
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:06,660
(Seongmin: Did you two have a serious chat? -Hwi: Yeah.)

1421
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:10,700
(Seungjin: I think I'll end up leaving after watching other people date.)

1422
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:14,220
(Haha)

1423
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:16,000
Seriously.

1424
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:22,860
(Seungjin: It's almost like a fantasy novel.)

1425
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:26,860
(Sad Seungjin: It's basically Harry Potter now...)

1426
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:34,500
(The next caller is Hanmin)

1427
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:45,500
(Youngjoon: I don't have much expectations or anxiety.)

1428
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:49,900
(Youngjoon: I think I'll naturally and calmly)

1429
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:54,460
(Youngjoon: end up talking to Hanmin.)

1430
01:06:55,820 --> 01:07:01,060
(Hanmin: Actually, the time I spent with him today is longer than anyone else.)

1431
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:07,620
(Hanmin: So I didn’t leave any space for others to enter my heart.)

1432
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:16,780
(Who is the man in Hanmin’s heart?)

1433
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:25,300
("Hello.")

1434
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:25,640
(Youngjoon and Hanmin called each other today as well.)

1435
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,570
They called the same person again.
(Youngjoon and Hanmin called each other today as well.)

1436
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:28,740
(Youngjoon and Hanmin called each other today as well.)

1437
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:32,340
(Youngjoon: Hurry and come back.)

1438
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:38,900
(Hanmin: First of all, I don't know if the ring we made today will turn out to be a couple ring or a friendship ring)

1439
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:44,140
(Youngjoon: Oh... Why are you saying that?)

1440
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:49,980
(Hanmin: Even if you go on a date with someone else, remember to take a look at this ring.)

1441
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:55,220
(Hanmin: I'm leaving, bye.)

1442
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:03,300
(Hanmin: But to be honest, I thought about a lot of things at the time.)

1443
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:08,020
(Hanmin: There was something I felt like I needed to tell him)

1444
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:11,500
(Hanmin: so I told him that.)

1445
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:17,020
(Youngjoon: 'Did he have to say that?')

1446
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:20,979
(Youngjoon: It also sounded like he's giving himself some space.)

1447
01:08:20,979 --> 01:08:23,220
(Youngjoon: I wasn't very happy after hearing that,)

1448
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:25,899
(Youngjoon: but I understand.)

1449
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:29,740
(Hanmin came back after the call.)

1450
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:33,899
(Youngjoon: Why did you say something so scary? -Hanmin: What?)

1451
01:08:33,899 --> 01:08:36,460
(Hanmin: Anyways, for the both of us...)

1452
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:40,580
(Hanmin: it's our first formal date with someone)

1453
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:43,740
(Hanmin: and there is still a lot of time left)

1454
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:48,140
(Hanmin: so I thought, 'maybe it's too early to settle.')

1455
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:52,060
(Hanmin: That’s what I thought when I told him.)

1456
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:59,060
(After Hanmin's call, the two became slightly awkward.)

1457
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:04,580
(Youngjoon: I don't wear friendship rings.)

1458
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,939
(-Myeongkyun: I have a level one certificate in psychology. -Minseon: What?)

1459
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:09,500
(-Myeongkyun: I have a level one certificate in psychology. -Minseon: Really?)

1460
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:15,979
(Minseon: You look smart now after saying you have a level one certificate in psychology.)

1461
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:21,899
(Myeongkyun: It's simply just identifying something through another person's perspective.)

1462
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:22,540
You should go call first.

1463
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:22,970
(Myeongkyun, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)
You should go call first.

1464
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:27,060
(Myeongkyun, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)

1465
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:31,010
(-Minseon: I was thinking about what to say and then we started talking about this. -Myeongkyun: Exactly.)

1466
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:32,060
Have a safe trip.
(-Minseon: I was thinking about what to say and then we started talking about this. -Myeongkyun: Exactly.)

1467
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:33,060
(-Minseon: I was thinking about what to say and then we started talking about this. -Myeongkyun: Exactly.)

1468
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:40,100
(Myeongkyun: What should I say?)

1469
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:46,220
(-Minseon: We've already come so far, you're not going to call someone else, right? -Myeongkyun: What?)

1470
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:49,180
(Myeongkyun: What I thought at the time was)

1471
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:53,540
(Myeongkyun: my feelings for Minseon are not 100% yet)

1472
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:59,300
(Myeongkyun: but does Minseon think I'm 100% sure of him now?)

1473
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:01,460
(Myeongkyun: Will he think that?)

1474
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:05,300
(Myeongkyun: I'm a little worried that he'll think that way.)

1475
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:06,820
(Minseon: He'll probably call me.)

1476
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:08,820
(Minseon: Actually, as long as Myeongkyun calls me)

1477
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:13,500
(Minseon: I don't care if other people call me or not)

1478
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,140
(Minseon: is how I feel.)

1479
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:23,180
(Myeongkyun spent a long time with Minseon today)

1480
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:32,740
(Does Myeongkyun feel the same way as Minseon?)

1481
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:39,370
(Thinking)

1482
01:10:39,370 --> 01:10:40,230
This is so hard.
(Thinking)

1483
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:42,380
(Thinking)

1484
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:03,180
(Myeongkyun: Hello?)

1485
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:05,500
(Myeongkyun: Did it take a while?)

1486
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:11,300
Hello? Yes.

1487
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,520
(Myeongkyun calls Minseon)
Hello? Yes.

1488
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:18,100
(Myeongkyun calls Minseon)

1489
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:24,660
(Myeongkyun: I actually already said what I wanted to say)

1490
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:26,740
("I had fun today.")

1491
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:30,220
(-Minseon: Okay, I'll see you upstairs. -Myeongkyun: Thank you.)

1492
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:38,700
(Minseon: First, I felt relieved.)

1493
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:44,700
(Minseon: I was relieved and happy that he called me.)

1494
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,420
(Minseon: That's what I thought.)

1495
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:51,220
We had a great time today.

1496
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:52,570
(Myeongkyun: We had a great time today)
We had a great time today.

1497
01:11:52,570 --> 01:11:53,420
(Myeongkyun: We had a great time today)

1498
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:59,060
(Myeongkyun: so when he had this 'Will he call someone else?' anxious look)

1499
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:02,180
(Myeongkyun: it made me worried.)

1500
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:04,620
(Myeongkyun: I also wanted to express my feelings towards him)

1501
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:07,940
(Myeongkyun: because I'm interested in him, too.)

1502
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,180
(Hwi: Wow, seriously, this place is like a mosquito nest.)

1503
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:16,110
(Seongmin receives a call)

1504
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:17,300
Wait, who is this?
(Seongmin receives a call)

1505
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:20,660
(Seongmin: Hello?)

1506
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:23,900
(Seongmin: Ah... hi.)

1507
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:28,940
(Jaeseung: Hi, it's Jaeseung.)

1508
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:33,900
(Jaeseung: I felt like I should call you today.)

1509
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:38,980
(Seongmin: Ah... thank you.)

1510
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:44,140
(-Jaeseung: I had fun when you came out on a date with me today. -Seongmin: Yeah.)

1511
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:46,820
("Good night.")

1512
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:50,460
(Seongmin: Good... good night.)

1513
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:55,260
(Jaeseung: Okay, I'll hang up now.)

1514
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,500
(Jaeseung: Honestly, I'm not sure)

1515
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:07,100
(Jaeseung: how Seongmin thinks.)

1516
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:09,140
(Jaeseung: Was his reaction positive?)

1517
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:13,980
(Jaeseung: What does his reaction mean? I'm not sure.)

1518
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:23,570
(Seongmin: I was hesitant as to whether or not I should call Jaeseung.)

1519
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:23,740
I was very confused.
(Seongmin: I was hesitant as to whether or not I should call Jaeseung.)

1520
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:25,180
(Confused Seongmin: I was very confused.)
I was very confused.

1521
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:26,420
(Confused Seongmin: I was very confused.)

1522
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:29,340
(Hwi: Who was it?)

1523
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:32,900
(Hwi: Who? Who?)

1524
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:36,940
(Hwi: Who was it...)

1525
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:40,020
(Hwi: To be honest, I wasn't happy.)

1526
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:43,180
(Seungjin: I was listening next to him, so I knew)

1527
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:46,420
(Seungjin: that Jaeseung called Seongmin.)

1528
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:51,180
(Seungjin: I feel like Jaeseung is really sure of his feelings towards Seongmin.)

1529
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:54,740
(Confused)

1530
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:02,310
(Hwi, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)

1531
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:02,340
It's me.
(Hwi, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)

1532
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:03,300
(Hwi: I'm doomed.)
It's me.

1533
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:05,860
(Seongmin: Wait, I'm going to... I don't want to stay here.)

1534
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:07,980
(-Seungjin: Why? -Seongmin: Wait, I just want to be alone.)

1535
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:10,540
(Seongmin: No, wait.)

1536
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:19,980
(In this complicated situation, Hwi walks towards the phone booth.)

1537
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:34,900
(Hwi: This is the first time in my life)

1538
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,860
(Hwi: that I'm feeling nervous because of someone)

1539
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:42,740
(Hwi: so that's why I think I feel even more sad.)

1540
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:51,340
(Hwi calls with a sad mood.)

1541
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:54,770
(On the other side, Seongmin found a place to be alone: the amusement room)

1542
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:56,050
It's not easy.
(On the other side, Seongmin found a place to be alone: the amusement room)

1543
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:05,220
(Seongmin: What should I do? What should I do...)

1544
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:09,420
(Seongmin: I wanted to avoid Seungjin and Hwi.)

1545
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:11,820
(Seongmin: I wanted to be alone.)

1546
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:15,500
(What should I do?)

1547
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:15,980
(Hwi's heart remains the same and is still on Seongmin)

1548
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:19,070
Seriously... what should I do...
(Hwi's heart remains the same and is still on Seongmin)

1549
01:15:19,070 --> 01:15:20,350
(Hwi's heart remains the same and is still on Seongmin)

1550
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:21,240
Hello?
(Hwi's heart remains the same and is still on Seongmin)

1551
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:22,380
(Hwi's heart remains the same and is still on Seongmin)

1552
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:29,020
(Hwi: Um... I felt like if I called you today as well)

1553
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:33,580
(Hwi: it would be too obvious so I wasn't going to call you)

1554
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:39,380
(Hwi: but I wanted to express my feelings honestly through the call... so I called.)

1555
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:40,410
so I called.
(Hwi: but I wanted to express my feelings honestly through the call... so I called.)

1556
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:43,980
(Seongmin: Thank you.)

1557
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:46,020
(Hwi: Good night.)

1558
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:47,740
(Seongmin: We're not sleeping yet.)

1559
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:50,100
(Hwi: See you later.)

1560
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:50,940
(Seongmin: See you in the room.)

1561
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:53,180
(Hwi: See you in the room.)

1562
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:07,550
(Because of Hwi's call, Seongmin is even more confused)

1563
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:10,420
Wait, I'm going crazy.
(Because of Hwi's call, Seongmin is even more confused)

1564
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:10,900
Wait, I'm going crazy.

1565
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,020
(I'm going crazy.)
Wait, I'm going crazy.

1566
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:14,300
(I'm going crazy.)

1567
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:17,540
(Seongmin: I'm really grateful for how consistent he is)

1568
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:22,940
(Seongmin: but I also feel really sorry. I'm so confused.)

1569
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,900
(Seongmin: 'Am I going to betray him again?')

1570
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:32,980
(Seongmin: and 'am I doing something wrong?')

1571
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:45,670
(Hwi: I was very sure yesterday)

1572
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:46,060
but then today I saw the two of them going out...
(Hwi: I was very sure yesterday)

1573
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:49,070
(Hwi: (Jaeseung&Seongmin) today I saw the two of them going out...)
but then today I saw the two of them going out...

1574
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:50,660
(Hwi: (Jaeseung&Seongmin) today I saw the two of them going out...)

1575
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:59,210
(Seongmin: Seriously...)

1576
01:16:59,210 --> 01:17:00,350
Seriously...
(Seongmin: Seriously...)

1577
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:06,980
(Seongmin: I'm constantly filled with thoughts.)

1578
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,540
(Seongmin: I feel like my head's going to explode.)

1579
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:16,620
(Seongmin, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like within 30 seconds)

1580
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:20,700
(Sighing)

1581
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:27,700
(Seongmin: Ah, really...)

1582
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:30,300
(Seongmin: Ah, really... What should I do?)

1583
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:36,380
(Even when in front of the phone, Seongmin is still confused.)

1584
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:40,460
(Seongmin: But, focusing on my feelings at the moment,)

1585
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:40,660
I'm going to call the person I like more.
(Seongmin: But, focusing on my feelings at the moment,)

1586
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:45,860
(Seongmin: I'm going to call the person I like more.)
I'm going to call the person I like more.

1587
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:50,300
(Seongmin: I think I became more confident after going inside the phone booth.)

1588
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:53,460
Seriously.

1589
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:54,330
(Who is Seongmin more interested in right now?)
Seriously.

1590
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:59,980
(Who is Seongmin more interested in right now?)

1591
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:04,980
(Jaeseung: I think Seongmin will call me today.)

1592
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:09,180
(Hwi: I actually didn't have any expectations)

1593
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:13,180
(Hwi: but I thought it would be nice if I got the call.)

1594
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:19,020
(Two men waiting for Seongmin's call)

1595
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:30,620
(Seongmin: What are you doing?)

1596
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:41,340
(-Hwi: Hello? -Seongmin: What are you doing?)

1597
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:50,700
(-Seongmin: What are you doing? Why were you confused? -Hwi: Oh? It's just...)

1598
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,260
(Seongmin: I'll see you back in the room.)

1599
01:18:54,260 --> 01:19:00,060
(-Hwi: Thank you. -Seongmin: Okay. What are you thanking me for?)

1600
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:03,660
(Hwi: Bye. -Seongmin: See you later.)

1601
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:07,460
(Seongmin: Did he hang up?)

1602
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:17,020
(Seongmin: The moment I decided to call Hwi)

1603
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:19,180
(Seongmin: was after my date with Jaeseung)

1604
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:24,140
(Seongmin: when I realized that 'I got along better with Hwi')

1605
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:31,380
(Seongmin: and that 'Hwi made me feel safe')

1606
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:35,580
(Seongming: so I made the decision.)

1607
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:40,860
(Happy twists in silence)

1608
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:44,740
(Hwi: 'Is this a prank?' was what I thought.)

1609
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:48,700
(Hwi: I'm so happy.)

1610
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:53,340
(Hwi: I couldn't stop smiling for several minutes after getting the call.)

1611
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:58,660
(Hwi: I was very happy.)

1612
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:08,860
(Seongmin comes back after the call.)

1613
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:16,540
(Seongmin can't comfortably go back to the room)

1614
01:20:18,810 --> 01:20:19,930
Seriously...

1615
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:23,180
(No, I'm a little... I'm a little...)

1616
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:24,380
Wait.

1617
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:26,290
(They can't look at each other after the call)
Wait.

1618
01:20:26,290 --> 01:20:27,490
(They can't look at each other after the call)

1619
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:28,140
Gosh.
(They can't look at each other after the call)

1620
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:28,200
(-Hwi: Should we sleep for a bit? -Seongmin: Ah~)
Gosh.
(They can't look at each other after the call)

1621
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,220
(-Hwi: Should we sleep for a bit? -Seongmin: Ah~)

1622
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:36,500
(-Hwi: Where have you been? -Seongming: Me? I went to make a call.)

1623
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:41,020
(-Seongmin: Oh are you asking about today? Today? -Hwi: No.)

1624
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:42,860
(After calling each other, the two are flustered.)

1625
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:44,690
Wait, I'm...
(After calling each other, the two are flustered.)

1626
01:20:44,690 --> 01:20:45,900
(After calling each other, the two are flustered.)

1627
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:47,700
(Hwi: It’s too hot.)

1628
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:48,460
What?
(Hwi: It’s too hot.)

1629
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:48,510
(Hwi: It's too hot.)
What?
(Hwi: It’s too hot.)

1630
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:51,220
(Hwi: It's too hot.)

1631
01:20:56,060 --> 01:21:01,060
(Day 3, the call time is over.)

1632
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:08,660
(Call time has ended)

1633
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:16,500
("It's a sad thing to not receive a call you were expecting.")

1634
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:20,820
(Jaeseung: I feel like I want to start from zero.)

1635
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:25,780
(Jaeseung: If I need to make a call tomorrow, I might not.)

1636
01:21:26,430 --> 01:21:27,280
Don't look.

1637
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:28,610
I'm not looking either.

1638
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:29,060
(The call time is over.)

1639
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:30,050
It's over.
(The call time is over.)

1640
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:30,910
(The call time is over.)

1641
01:21:30,910 --> 01:21:32,970
Why am I always the last to receive it?
(The call time is over.)

1642
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:33,660
(The call time is over.)

1643
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:37,620
(Seungjin: I didn't get a single call today again.)

1644
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:40,860
(Seungjin: I'm not that happy.)

1645
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:44,060
(Seungjin: The person I called wasn't someone I actually wanted to call.)

1646
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:49,230
(Seungjin: I'm also disappointed at myself for not being able to call the person I'm interested in.)

1647
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:49,500
So it was a bad call.
(Seungjin: I'm also disappointed at myself for not being able to call the person I'm interested in.)

1648
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:49,540
So it was a bad call.

1649
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:52,630
("So it was a bad call.")
So it was a bad call.

1650
01:21:52,630 --> 01:21:54,940
("So it was a bad call.")

1651
01:21:57,540 --> 01:22:02,410
(Seongmin: Did you have fun today?)

1652
01:22:02,410 --> 01:22:02,980
No.
(Seongmin: Did you have fun today?)

1653
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:07,300
(-Seongmin: Was it boring? -Hwi: It was fun)

1654
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:10,610
(Hwi: I just missed...)

1655
01:22:10,610 --> 01:22:10,900
I just missed...
(Hwi: I just missed...)

1656
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:11,750
(-Shy, Hwi: I just missed... -Seongmin: Me?)
I just missed...

1657
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:13,000
-Me? -Yeah.
(-Shy, Hwi: I just missed... -Seongmin: Me?)

1658
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,300
(-Shy, Hwi: I just missed... -Seongmin: Me?)

1659
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:19,260
(Shy, Hwi: So I put two photos here.)

1660
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:20,940
(Hwi put Seongmin's photo next to his bed)

1661
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:23,730
I didn't put it here.
(Hwi put Seongmin's photo next to his bed)

1662
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:26,820
(Hwi put Seongmin's photo next to his bed)

1663
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:30,740
(-Seongmin: We look like kids here. -Hwi: Yeah.)

1664
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:32,980
(Hwi: I'm going to take it with me after the show ends.)

1665
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:35,460
(Seongmin: But this is me. I'm the only one in the photo.)

1666
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:39,380
(-Hwi: I'll take both. -Seongmin: I'm taking this one.)

1667
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:44,100
(What should I do?)

1668
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:47,860
(Seongmin's "what should I do?" time is back)

1669
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:53,220
(Hwi is shy, too.)

1670
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:55,360
It's over.

1671
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:58,300
(Youngjoon: Hanmin got a call today, too.)

1672
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:02,740
(Youngjoon: I don't think anyone approached him...)

1673
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:04,140
(Youngjoon: so I felt reassured?)

1674
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:06,580
(Myeongkyun: I want to go on a date with Hanmin.)

1675
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:12,020
(Myeongkyun: I don't think I feel romantically towards Youngjoon.)

1676
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:16,940
(Myeongkyun: But even so,)

1677
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:18,980
(Myeongkyun: I want to make sure.)

1678
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:21,860
(Seongmin: 'I want to go on a date with Hanmin' was what I thought.)

1679
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:22,100
I want to try it out with the three people I like.

1680
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:26,340
(Seongmin: I want to try it out with the three people I like.)
I want to try it out with the three people I like.

1681
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:29,580
(Seongmin: Because that way I won't have any regrets.)

1682
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:31,980
(Seongmin: This is a jungle afterall.)

1683
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:35,140
(Hanmin: Honestly, I don't know if it's because)

1684
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:37,940
(Hanmin: I haven't gone on a date with anyone yet,)

1685
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:44,060
(Hanmin: but I want to go on a date with Jaeseung.)

1686
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:49,660
(The hearts of men that don't know where to go)

1687
01:23:50,330 --> 01:23:51,600
Also...

1688
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:54,860
(-Seungjin: I feel so stressed. -Hwi: Why? Why?)

1689
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:57,700
(Seungjin walks towards the phone booth)

1690
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:00,940
(Seungjin: I really don't know who to call.)

1691
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:04,060
(-Hwi: Were you worried until that moment? -Seungjin: Yeah.)

1692
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:07,740
(Seungjin: Ever since yesterday, with Seongmin,)

1693
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:09,740
(Seungjin: I became closer to him)

1694
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:13,740
(Seungjin: so I don't want to call anyone else.)

1695
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:16,940
(Hwi: To be honest, I thought you'd call Jaeseung.)

1696
01:24:17,070 --> 01:24:17,740
I really couldn't bring myself to.

1697
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:18,830
(Seungjin: I really couldn't bring myself to call Jaeseung.)
I really couldn't bring myself to.

1698
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:19,460
(Seungjin: I really couldn't bring myself to call Jaeseung.)

1699
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:24,420
(Seungjin: So in the end I called Seongmin because I had fun on the date today.)

1700
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:30,580
(Hwi: I felt a little relieved then.)

1701
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:32,860
(Hanmin: Why are there so many secrets?)

1702
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,160
Yeah, somehow...

1703
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:37,150
(Jaeseung: Somehow I became a man with lots of secrets.)

1704
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:38,180
Whatever.
(Jaeseung: Somehow I became a man with lots of secrets.)

1705
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:39,100
Are you teasing me?

1706
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:40,050
(Are you teasing me?)
Are you teasing me?

1707
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:40,380
Whatever, I'm not curious.
(Are you teasing me?)
Are you teasing me?

1708
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:40,580
Whatever, I'm not curious.

1709
01:24:40,580 --> 01:24:41,340
(I'm not curious~)
Whatever, I'm not curious.

1710
01:24:41,630 --> 01:24:42,510
Whatever~

1711
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:43,500
I'm not curious. Cheers.

1712
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:44,140
(Cheers)
I'm not curious. Cheers.

1713
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:44,980
(Cheers)

1714
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:49,980
(Minseon: Oh? My slippers are gone again.)

1715
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:53,580
(Minseon: At this point, I feel like someone is taking them.)

1716
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:55,870
(-Minseon: Every time I wear them... -Myeongkyun: I feel more comfortable barefooted.)

1717
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:56,520
Really?
(-Minseon: Every time I wear them... -Myeongkyun: I feel more comfortable barefooted.)

1718
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:56,540
Oh yeah!

1719
01:24:56,540 --> 01:24:57,370
(Myeongkyun takes off his slippers for Minseon)
Oh yeah!

1720
01:24:57,370 --> 01:24:58,570
(Myeongkyun takes off his slippers for Minseon)

1721
01:24:58,570 --> 01:24:59,390
Try it.
(Myeongkyun takes off his slippers for Minseon)

1722
01:24:59,390 --> 01:25:00,810
Whatever.

1723
01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:06,860
Earlier I said I had cold soba noodles...

1724
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:09,430
(-Hanmin: Earlier I said I had cold soba noodles... -Minseon: He said McMorning. -Youngjoon: McDonald's breakfast?)
Earlier I said I had cold soba noodles...

1725
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:10,550
He said McMorning.
(-Hanmin: Earlier I said I had cold soba noodles... -Minseon: He said McMorning. -Youngjoon: McDonald's breakfast?)

1726
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:11,600
McDonald's breakfast.
(-Hanmin: Earlier I said I had cold soba noodles... -Minseon: He said McMorning. -Youngjoon: McDonald's breakfast?)

1727
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:11,700
No, because the pronunciation...

1728
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:13,700
(Myeongkyun xplaining for Minseon: No, because the pronunciation...)
No, because the pronunciation...

1729
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:15,700
(Youngjoon: Are you two going to be like this? (Myeongkyun&Minseon))

1730
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:16,690
(-Youngjoon: Are they playing a couple? -Hanmin: I think so.)

1731
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:18,010
-I think so. -No.
(-Youngjoon: Are they playing a couple? -Hanmin: I think so.)

1732
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:18,810
-I think I'm jealous. -No.

1733
01:25:18,810 --> 01:25:19,180
I'm always like this.

1734
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:19,600
(I think I'm jealous)
I'm always like this.

1735
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:20,380
(I think I'm jealous)

1736
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:21,620
I think I'm jealous.

1737
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:23,420
(Hehe)

1738
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:27,830
(Seongmin has been in his room ever since the call)

1739
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:28,550
Gosh...
(Seongmin has been in his room ever since the call)

1740
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:29,980
(Seongmin has been in his room ever since the call)

1741
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:33,580
(Hesitating)

1742
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:40,260
(Awkward Seongming, and Jaeseung who is avoiding Seongmin)

1743
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:43,820
(-Youngjoon: You don't have bangs anymore. -Seongmin: Yeah.)

1744
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:46,430
I got rid of my bangs.

1745
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:47,960
But the cold soba noodles...

1746
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:48,140
What did you do? What were you doing?

1747
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:49,610
(-Youngjoon: What did you do? What were you doing? -Minseon: I didn't do anything.)
What did you do? What were you doing?

1748
01:25:49,610 --> 01:25:50,530
(-Youngjoon: What did you do? What were you doing? -Minseon: I didn't do anything.)

1749
01:25:50,530 --> 01:25:51,300
I didn't do anything.
(-Youngjoon: What did you do? What were you doing? -Minseon: I didn't do anything.)

1750
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:53,170
(-Hanmin: Did you eat something good? -Seongmin: Yeah.)

1751
01:25:53,170 --> 01:25:53,500
Did you have dinner before coming back?
(-Hanmin: Did you eat something good? -Seongmin: Yeah.)

1752
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:53,820
Did you have dinner before coming back?

1753
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:54,270
(The men are curious about Jaeseung and Seongmin's date)
Did you have dinner before coming back?

1754
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:55,940
Cold soba noodles?
(The men are curious about Jaeseung and Seongmin's date)

1755
01:25:55,940 --> 01:25:56,120
(The men are curious about Jaeseung and Seongmin's date)

1756
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:57,050
What did you eat?
(The men are curious about Jaeseung and Seongmin's date)

1757
01:25:57,350 --> 01:25:58,460
We didn't have dinner.

1758
01:25:58,460 --> 01:25:58,520
(Seongmin: We didn't do anything.)
We didn't have dinner.

1759
01:25:58,520 --> 01:25:59,660
(Seongmin: We didn't do anything.)

1760
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:02,300
(Youngjoon: You didn't do anything? Why?)

1761
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:04,620
(Youngjoon: Did you two promise each other that you won't do anything?)

1762
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:06,540
(Sad)

1763
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:08,460
(Hanmin: He's smiling.)

1764
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:11,180
(Jaesung: We just chatted and chatted. Happy?)

1765
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:14,300
(Seongmin: I'm going to... I'm going to head back to my room.)

1766
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:18,980
(Seongmin leaves in the end)

1767
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:22,740
(Jaeseung's expression looks even darker after Seongmin leaves)

1768
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:31,780
(-Seungjin: I'm not feeling good today. -Minseon: Since the morning?)

1769
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:32,900
(Seungjin: Not from the morning.)

1770
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:35,900
(Seungjin: I've been like this ever since coming home.)

1771
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:39,220
(Seungjin: I keep spacing out.)

1772
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:42,140
(Minseon: Do you have someone you like?)

1773
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:45,740
(Seungjin: I'm actually the most interested in Jaeseung right now.)

1774
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:48,980
(Seungjin: But it's not like I like him a lot.)

1775
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:54,500
(Seungjin: No matter what, everyone now knows how Jaeseung feels towards Minseon)

1776
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:57,780
(Seungjin: so I don't want to bother him.)

1777
01:26:57,980 --> 01:27:02,420
(Seungjin: I don't want to get hurt so I also don't want to hurt others.)

1778
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:06,340
(Seungjin: I'm not that kind of person.)

1779
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:11,670
(Seungjin: I've been thinking about this phrase for a while,)

1780
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:11,820
-"You have to love yourself first to love others." -That's right.
(Seungjin: I've been thinking about this phrase for a while,)

1781
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:15,980
(Seungjin: "You have to love yourself first to love others.")
-"You have to love yourself first to love others." -That's right.

1782
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:19,100
(Seungjin: This phrase keeps lingering in my mind.)

1783
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:20,820
(Seungjin: I may look like this on the outside,)

1784
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:23,460
(Seungjin: but my pride is actually pretty low.)

1785
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:26,900
(Minseon: I think you know it, too.)

1786
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:30,220
(Minseon: How you should love yourself.)

1787
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:34,340
(Minseon: I think you love yourself enough)

1788
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:38,220
(Minseon: but you always lack confidence.)

1789
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:45,300
(-Seungjin: I feel better now after talking to you about it. -Minseon: Yeah, I can tell.)

1790
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:54,260
(Seungjin: I thought, 'if I don't say it, I'm really going to suffer inside.')

1791
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:59,900
(Seungjin: I really wanted to cry today... so...)

1792
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:03,500
(Seungjin: What do you like about Myeongkyun? -Minseon: What I like about him?)

1793
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:06,700
(Minseon: At first, I was attracted to his nonsense.)

1794
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:08,380
(Minseon: four-dimensional! -Seungjin: Oh.)

1795
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:11,540
(Minseon: I think it's funny. I couldn't stop laughing.)

1796
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:14,500
(Minseon: I just wanted to get to know him more.)

1797
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:18,580
(-Seungjin: Did Myeongkyun tell you who he called yesterday? -Minseon: No, I didn't ask.)

1798
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:20,580
(Seungjin: Oh, you didn't you ask? Well done.)

1799
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:22,260
(Seungjin: Well done, well done.)

1800
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:24,740
(Minseon: I don't want to ask.)

1801
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:28,100
(-Seungjin: It's better to not know sometimes. -Minseon: Yeah, I don't want to know.)

1802
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:30,500
(Seungjin: It's better to not know sometimes.)

1803
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:34,460
(And...)

1804
01:28:38,740 --> 01:28:42,940
(Seongmin's phone suddenly gets a notification)

1805
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:50,820
(Seongmin, who received the most calls today, has the chance to choose his room and roommates.)

1806
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:56,540
(But he can't pick his current roommates and this mission cannot be revealed to anyone.)

1807
01:28:56,740 --> 01:29:05,020
(Seongmin is flustered after receiving a secret mission)

1808
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:10,100
(Why should I go through this?)

1809
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:12,500
(Seongmin: I think this is too much.)

1810
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:15,220
(What should I do?)

1811
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:21,420
(Seongmin: I want to be roommates with Hwi.)

1812
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:22,900
(Seongmin: We've gotten closer)

1813
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:27,260
(Seongmin: so I kept writing and deleting.)

1814
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:32,740
(Seongmin can't decide to assign the rooms.)

1815
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:40,180
(Hwi: Are you asleep?)

1816
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:46,740
(Seongmin: Ah, wait...)

1817
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:50,260
(Seongmin: Let's sleep.)

1818
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:58,380
(After thinking about it, Seongming sends a text message behind Hwi.)

1819
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:04,420
(Confused)

1820
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:08,780
(Seongmin: I need to make a wise choice.)

1821
01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:11,620
(Seongmin: I'm so lost.)

1822
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:13,370
(You scared me. The rooms are sorted.)

1823
01:30:13,370 --> 01:30:14,650
You scared me.
(You scared me. The rooms are sorted.)

1824
01:30:14,650 --> 01:30:16,470
(You scared me. The rooms are sorted.)

1825
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:16,540
What did you receive?
(You scared me. The rooms are sorted.)

1826
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:17,620
(Hwi: What text did you receive?)
What did you receive?

1827
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:18,740
(Hwi: What text did you receive?)

1828
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:22,940
(-Hwi: I feel uneasy. What text did you receive? -Seongmin: Nothing.)

1829
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:26,980
(Why did you send it... Why did you send it? Why did you send it?!)

1830
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:30,100
(Ah...)

1831
01:30:33,780 --> 01:30:36,100
(-Seongmin: What am I doing? -Hwi: What's wrong?)

1832
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:39,020
(Seongmin: Ah, I'm going crazy.)

1833
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:40,870
(Hwi: Who? Who sent it to you? Who is it?)

1834
01:30:40,870 --> 01:30:43,200
-Hurry up and say it. -I don't know either.
(Hwi: Who? Who sent it to you? Who is it?)

1835
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:48,380
(Seongmin is in pain and Hwi is confused)

1836
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:52,660
(Ahhhhhh T T)

1837
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:55,780
(Seongmin: Are you out of your mind? You must be out of your mind.)

1838
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:57,380
What's wrong? What's wrong?
(Seongmin: Are you out of your mind? You must be out of your mind.)

1839
01:30:57,380 --> 01:30:58,780
(Seongmin: Are you out of your mind? You must be out of your mind.)

1840
01:30:58,780 --> 01:31:00,020
(Hwi: Hurry, tell me what is it?)

1841
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:01,520
What is it?
(Hwi: Hurry, tell me what is it?)

1842
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:02,300
(Hwi: Hurry, tell me what is it?)

1843
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:05,100
(Seongmin: I should do it based on my instincts.)

1844
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:09,500
(Seongmin: My choice is...)

1845
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:13,380
(The next morning)

1846
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:22,700
(Seongmin: The three men I like are: Hwi, Jaeseung and Hanmin.)

1847
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:24,940
(Today is the day to change rooms. The room and roommates have already been decided by someone. Third-floor single room: Hwi. Second-floor four people room: Minseon, Seungjin, Myeongkyun, Youngjoon. Second-floor single room: Jaeseung. First-floor double room: Seongmin, Hanmin.)

1848
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:27,700
(A sudden change of roommates. The men are confused.)

1849
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:31,340
(Oh? Who made the decision?)

1850
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:34,980
(I want to avoid it)

1851
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:38,060
(Hwi: How's the four people room?)

1852
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:40,700
("This is driving me crazy.")

1853
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:45,580
(A new mission keeps coming.)

1854
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:50,060
(Please ask a question to the man you're interested in. Questions will be anonymous.)

1855
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:52,080
(To. Youngjoon: I can't feel your sincerity. Can't you be more straightforward?)

1856
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,540
I can't feel your sincerity.
(To. Youngjoon: I can't feel your sincerity. Can't you be more straightforward?)

1857
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:56,720
Can't you be more straightforward?
(To. Youngjoon: I can't feel your sincerity. Can't you be more straightforward?)

1858
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:59,060
(I swear I never hid my true feelings.)

1859
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:01,340
(I never did anything fake.)

1860
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:03,580
(The only person who would say that to me)

1861
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:06,380
("is probably Myeongkyun.")

1862
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:07,060
(To. Jaeseung: Q. Are you sure about your feelings for Seongmin?)

1863
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:09,720
Are you sure about your feelings for Seongmin?)
(To. Jaeseung: Q. Are you sure about your feelings for Seongmin?)

1864
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:11,100
(To. Jaeseung: Q. Are you sure about your feelings for Seongmin?)

1865
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:12,700
(A question that makes the men flustered)

1866
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:13,770
So fierce
(A question that makes the men flustered)

1867
01:32:13,770 --> 01:32:17,620
(A question that makes the men flustered)

1868
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:22,500
("I'm not sure.")

1869
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:27,740
(Seongmin: I'm disappointed that he said he's not sure.)

1870
01:32:28,980 --> 01:32:31,420
(I can see the signs of internal split.)

1871
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:34,540
(We're kind of like...)

1872
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:37,000
(Survival Battle)
