161
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,190
-Oh no. -It's ruined.

162
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:16,530
(The vase suddenly collapses)
-Oh no. -It's ruined.

163
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,470
Oh no.
(The vase suddenly collapses)

164
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,650
(The vase suddenly collapses)

165
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,200
(Panicking)

166
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,130
Oh no.
(Panicking)

167
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,730
(Startled) (It's ruined)

168
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,090
-Oh no. -It's ruined.
(Startled) (It's ruined)

169
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,210
-Oh no. -It's okay.

170
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:26,460
(Seongmin: What's wrong with me?)
-Oh no. -It's okay.

171
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,050
-What's wrong with me? -It's really okay.
(Seongmin: What's wrong with me?)

172
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,790
-What's wrong with me? -It's really okay.

173
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,860
(When the two are panicking, a car heads towards them)

174
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:33,260
(Clueless about what's about to happen as they clean up busily)

175
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,450
-I'm hopeless. -But...
(Clueless about what's about to happen as they clean up busily)

176
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,059
(Clueless about what's about to happen as they clean up busily)

177
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:36,330
(It's the first gift, sigh)

178
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,190
At least it didn't wet the camera.
(It's the first gift, sigh)

179
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:38,600
(It's the first gift, sigh)

180
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,570
-It's a little... -Now...
(It's the first gift, sigh)

181
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:39,820
(Seongmin: I'm so sorry)
-It's a little... -Now...
(It's the first gift, sigh)

182
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,740
(Seongmin: I'm so sorry)

183
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:47,490
(And here comes the last man)

184
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,850
(Myeongkyun: Actually I've a lot of worriese too)

185
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,270
(Myeongkyun: What if the person I like is...)

186
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,070
(Myeongkyun: already in good terms with someone else?)

187
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:01,080
I really love it. Since coming to Men's House, right now's...
(Myeongkyun: already in good terms with someone else?)

188

189
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,190
(Myeongkyun: Hello)
(Hwi: Hello)

190
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,730
Right now's my favorite...

191
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,920
-Hello. -Hello.

192
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,470

-What a surprise. -Gosh.

195
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,070
(With Myeongkyun's arrival, the vase falls again)
-What a surprise. -Gosh.

196
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,830
(With Myeongkyun's arrival, the vase falls again)

197
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,620
(Seongmin: Hello. What's going on?)

198
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,480
Hold on.

199
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,970
(Seongmin: What a surprise)

200
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:26,990
What a surprise.
(Seongmin: What a surprise)

201
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,590
-Hello. -You surprised me.

202
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,530
(Seongmin: I was really surprised. Really surprised)

203
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:38,250
(Hwi: Sigh, it was nice with just the two of us. Why did he come here?)

204
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,840
(Hwi: It really left me feeling deflated)

205
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:48,990
(Myeongkyun: I'm Jo Myeongkyun. I'll be moving in with you from today on)

206
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:49,330
-Jo Myeongkyun? -Yes.

209
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,760
(Seongmin: Myeongkyun?)
-Myeongkyun? -Yes.

210
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,770
(Seongmin: Myeongkyun?)

211
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,740
(Hwi: I'm Kim Hwi. Single-character name)

212
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,260
(Seongmin: I'm Bae Seongmin)

213

215
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,350
(Seongmin: You're joining us today)

216
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,400
(Hwi: I was really surprised)

217
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,830
(Seongmin: Wow. So suddenly?)

218
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,790
(Hwi: It suddenly became awkward)

219
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:24,600
(Hwi: He looks like the kind where everyone would call him handsome)

220
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,100
(Hwi: He’s tall. He looks kind of like a model)

221
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:35,440
(Awkward atmosphere surrounding the three of them)

222
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,780
(Myeongkyun: When Hwi first saw me, he looked confused)

223
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,110
(Looking carefully)

224
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,530
(Myeongkyun: First, Seongmin looked gentle)

225
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:53,850
(Myeongkyun: He seemed shy)

226
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,960
(How will Myeongkyun's arrival change the dynamics among the men?)

227
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,300
(Seongmin: How did you come here?)

228
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,430
(Myeongkyun: Based on a one-phrase self-introduction,)

229
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,730
(Myeongkyun: I'd to pick someone I like. I chose this card)

(Seongmin: Wow... Who could it be?)

233
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,140
(Seongmin: Who do you think it is?)

234
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,210
-I can't tell yet. -You can't?
(Seongmin: Who do you think it is?)

235
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,390
-I can't tell yet. -You can't?

236
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,670
Yes, both your eyes and hands are...

237
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:25,700
(Embarrassed for no reason)
Yes, both your eyes and hands are...

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,700
(Embarrassed for no reason)

240
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,280
(Seongmin: Based on these introductions...)

241
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:32,310
(Seongmin: The introduction is a really beautiful phrase. "Self-esteem Guardian with beautiful eyes and hands.")

242
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,770
-The introduction... -Yes.
(Seongmin: The introduction is a really beautiful phrase. "Self-esteem Guardian with beautiful eyes and hands.")

243
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,520
Is a really beautiful phrase.
(Seongmin: The introduction is a really beautiful phrase. "Self-esteem Guardian with beautiful eyes and hands.")

250
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,270
(Myeongkyun: I heard he was here. So I came here)

251
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:52,760
(Seongmin: Because I know it's my introduction, I feel embarrassed)

252
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,450
(Hwi: It made me nervous)

253
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:00,290
(Hwi: Because he likes the self-introduction of the person I like,)

254
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,660
(Hwi: I feel a little uneasy)

255
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,880
(Seongmin: Who do you think the card belongs to?)

256
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,900
(Seongmin: I'm curious)

257
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,950
(I'm. So. Curious)

258
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:11,210

(Hands) (Curious)
-Hands? -Hands.

263
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,560
(Hands) (Curious)

264
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,200
(My hands aren't pretty)

265
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,750
(My hands aren't either...)

266
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,530
(I should hide my hands)

267
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,640
(Myeongkyun: I think the self-introduction belongs to...)

268
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,220
(Myeongkyun: Judging from your reactions... Seongmin?)

269
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,310
(Seongmin: Me?)
(Myeongkyun: Is it not?)

270
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,760
(Seongmin: Maybe? Maybe not?)

271
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,420
(Trying to stay calm)

272
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,730
(Seongmin: I thought Hwi's eyes are pretty when I first saw him)

273
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,670
Really?
(Seongmin: I thought Hwi's eyes are pretty when I first saw him)

274
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,410
(Seongmin: I thought Hwi's eyes are pretty when I first saw him)

275
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,930
(Ha. Ha. Ha. Who. Could. It. Be?)

276
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:58,340
(Seongmin: But besides this one, what's written on the other cards? I'm curious)

277
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,120
(Myeongkyun: Other cards...)

278
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:06,410
(Myeongkyun: What I remember was...)

279
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,150
(Myeongkyun: "A large dog who doesn't match his size")

280
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,910
(Hwi: I think I know who it is)
(Seongmin: Who is it?)

281
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,530
(Hwi: Isn't it Minseon? He has a larger frame)

282
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,770
(Myeongkyun: And "A fun old cat if we get close")

283
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,020
(Seongmin: But I think the old cat...)

284
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,800
(Seongmin: What's the rest of the phrase?)

285
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,610
(Seongmin: For the old cat)

286
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:28,920
(Hwi: "A fun old cat if we get close")
(Myeongkyun: "A fun old cat if we get close")
(Seongmin: "If we get close")

287
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,020
-That was what it said. -Who do you think it is?

288
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,220
(Hwi: Seungjin)

289
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,210
(Hwi: He has a cat-like face)

290
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:42,400
(Myeongkyun: Another one was... "Dexterous person")

291
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,660
For that...
(Myeongkyun: Another one was... "Dexterous person")

292
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,430
(Seongmin: Wait, Hwi, aren't you included too?)

293
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,190
(Who knows? Haha)

294
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:48,310
Don't tell me you're the old cat?
(Who knows? Haha)

295
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,070
(Seongmin: Don't tell me you're the "old cat" (keyword)?)
Don't tell me you're the old cat?

296
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,770
(Maybe)

297
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:54,640
-You must be the dexterous one. -Am I?

298
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,360
(Seongmin: You must be the dexterous one)
-You must be the dexterous one. -Am I?

299
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,850
(Seongmin: You must be the dexterous one)

300
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:03,490
(Myeongkyun: I chose this card for a reason)
(Seongmin: Why?)

301
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,970
-I... -This card.

302
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,020
(Nervous)

303
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,990
(Myeongkyun: I like guys with beautiful eyes)

304
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,180
-Beautiful eyes. -Yes.

305
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,470
(Annoyed)
-Beautiful eyes. -Yes.

306
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,890
(Annoyed)

307
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:14,700
-We... -Because I like beautiful eyes.
(Annoyed)

308
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,090
-We... -Because I like beautiful eyes.

309
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,470
(Seongmin: We both have beautiful eyes)

310
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,530
(Myeongkyun: So I was conflicted)

311
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,720
(Myeongkyun: I don't really care about hands)

312
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,960
(Myeongkyun: And especially about him being a "Self-esteem Guardian")

313
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,850
(Myeongkyun: I thought he'll have a good personality,)

314
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,450
(Myeongkyun: speak nicely,)

315
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,810
(Myeongkyun: and be gentle too)

(Minseon: No way)
(Youngjoon: Really?)

631
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,230
(Seungjin: There are blankets on your sacred beds)

632
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,630
-Haha. -On your sacred beds.
(Seungjin: There are blankets on your sacred beds)

633
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:18,680
(Minseon & Youngjoon's double room turns into a quadruple room)
-Haha. -On your sacred beds.
(Seungjin: There are blankets on your sacred beds)

634
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,240
(Minseon & Youngjoon's double room turns into a quadruple room)

635
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,660
Ah!
(Minseon & Youngjoon's double room turns into a quadruple room)

636
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,810
(Minseon: No way!)

637
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:27,510
(Minseon: Another set of mint ones)
(Youngjoon: You're right)

638
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:31,980
(Youngjoon: Choosing places is nerve-racking and...)
(Minseon: What should we do?)

639
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,540
(Youngjoon: Let's just ask them to pick)
(Minseon: Whatever)

640
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,390
(Youngjoon: They came later, so they pick what they like)
(Minseon: Let them decide)

641
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,690
If we have to choose...

642
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,850
(Jaeseung: Since yesterday, I feel like you two are getting more and more in sync)

643
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,370
We became besties.
(Jaeseung: Since yesterday, I feel like you two are getting more and more in sync)

644
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,830
(Minseon: We even dated)

645
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:46,920
We're done.
(Minseon: We even dated)

646
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,720
(Minseon: It's natural that we're in sync)
We're done.

647
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,180
You have great chemistry.
(Minseon: It's natural that we're in sync)

648
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:53,810
(Jaeseung: Ours was like a "Please Get Closer" date)

649
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,400
(Youngjoon: Since you two aren't even roommates)

650
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:56,410
I stole his seat.
(Youngjoon: Since you two aren't even roommates)

651
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,290
I stole his seat.

652
00:26:59,030 --> 00:26:59,620
(Hanmin sits next to Youngjoon)

653
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,500
Have a seat.
(Hanmin sits next to Youngjoon)

654
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,700
Sit inside.
(Hanmin sits next to Youngjoon)

655
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,010
(Jaeseung: Sit in the middle)

656
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,270
(Hanmin: Thank you)

657
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,100
(Jaeseung: I think (the second-floor quadruple room) will be our base)

658
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,690
That's right.
(Jaeseung: I think (the second-floor quadruple room) will be our base)

659
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:10,750
(Youngjoon: It's already our base)

660
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,270
(Hwi, Seongmin, and Myeongkyun are last to come home)

661
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,150
You must be nervous.
(Hwi, Seongmin, and Myeongkyun are last to come home)

662
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,030
-Really. -The first meeting.
(Hwi, Seongmin, and Myeongkyun are last to come home)

663
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,820
-We were really nervous when we first met. -Right.

664
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:17,870
(Noises)

665
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,730
That order is the most important.
(Noises)

666
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:20,350
(Noises)

667
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,350
(They're here!)

668
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,280
-Originally... -I want to hide.
(They're here!)

669
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:23,480
(Men getting nervous upon hearing the door squeaking)

670
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,810
I want to hide this time.
(Men getting nervous upon hearing the door squeaking)

671
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,470
(Men getting nervous upon hearing the door squeaking)

672
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,500
-They have flowers. -They have flowers.

673
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,800
(They applaud first to welcome them back)

674
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,230
(Youngjoon: What's going on?)
(Minseon: Where's the newbie?)

675
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,610
Hello.
(Youngjoon: What's going on?)
(Minseon: Where's the newbie?)

676
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,130
(Youngjoon: What's going on?)
(Minseon: Where's the newbie?)

677
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:34,740
Hello.

678
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,430
(Finally, the last man Myeongkyun meets everyone)
Hello.

679
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,600
(Finally, the last man Myeongkyun meets everyone)

680
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,530
What's going on?
(Finally, the last man Myeongkyun meets everyone)

681
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,630
(Wow)

682
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,790
(Clapping)

683
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:49,740
(Minseon: He's handsome and lit up the room)

684
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,020
(Minseon: He changed the atmosphere)

685
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:58,490
(Jaeseung: He's tall and has prominent facial features)

686
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,780
(Jaeseung: He's cool)

687
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,980
(Youngjoon: My heart dropped)

688
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:11,740
(Youngjoon's face obviously hardens with Myeongkyun's arrival)

689
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,400
(Youngjoon: I was really shocked)

690
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:29,130
(Myeongkyun: He still has a great style and dresses up well)

691
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:32,340
(Myeongkyun: He hasn't changed at all. He looks great)

692
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:32,760
Did I sit here too naturally?

693
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,280
(Myeongkyun looks flustered as well)
Did I sit here too naturally?

694
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,350
Please sit down.
(Myeongkyun looks flustered as well)

695
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,240
Can I sit here?

696
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,250
-You brought flowers. -We prepared flowers.

697
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,850
(Myeongkyun sits next to Youngjoon)
-You brought flowers. -We prepared flowers.

698
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,510
(Myeongkyun sits next to Youngjoon)

699
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,810
(Youngjoon: I avoided looking his way)

700
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,690
(Youngjoon: I didn't know how to act)

701
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,660
(Youngjoon: I suddenly got really nervous)

702
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,310
(Youngjoon and Myeongkyun look a bit confused)

703
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,380
-We... -No, no.

704
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,670
(Youngjoon doesn't look towards Myeongkyun)
-We... -No, no.

705
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,860
(Youngjoon doesn't look towards Myeongkyun)

706
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:04,420
(Myeongkyun: He acted like we don't know each other, so I panicked)

707
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,950
(Minseon: Let's introduce ourselves)

708
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,700
(Minseon: Because there are two newbies?)

709
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,190
(Minseon: Introduce ourselves)

710
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:28,590
(Myeongkyun: I'm Jo Myeongkyun, who will move in from today)

711
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,650
(Hanmin: He looks fancy)

712
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:38,630
(Hanmin: He looks like a model)

713
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,660
(Hanmin: I'll introduce myself next)

714
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:46,550
(Hanmin: I'm Kim Hanmin, who'll also move in from today on)

715
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,970
(Staring)

716
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:53,730
(Seongmin: Looks-wise, Hanmin is close to my ideal type)

717
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:58,250
(Myeongkyun: He's handsome. I think he works out too)

718
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,740
Nice to meet you. I think everyone's here.

719
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,550
Everyone is here.

720
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,490
We're all here.

721
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:05,830
(Youngjoon: Our room's now a quadruple room)

722
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:08,440
(Youngjoon: The double room turned into a quadruple room)

723
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,920
(Minseon: There are two more chairs in the kitchen too)

724
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,430
(Seungjin: Have you eaten?)
(Hwi: No)

725
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,620
(Seungjin: Let's prepare dinner now)

726
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,280
(Jaeseung: We'll prepare dinner)

727
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,810
(Jaeseung: The newbies can unpack their stuff)

728
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:27,740
(Youngjoon: We'll go help and come back down)

729
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:34,530
(The first meeting of eight men filled with surprises and shock)

730
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:36,400
It'd look nice here.

731
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,510
(Hwi & Seongmin are looking for a place to put the vases they made together)
It'd look nice here.

732
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,840
-Just put it there. -We'll donate it here.
(Hwi & Seongmin are looking for a place to put the vases they made together)

733
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,360
(Hwi & Seongmin are looking for a place to put the vases they made together)

734
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,930
(Seungjin: Are these real flowers?)
(Seongmin: Yes)

735
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:43,860
I want to smell it too.
(Seungjin: Are these real flowers?)
(Seongmin: Yes)

736
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,340
(Smelling)
(Seongmin: I got this as a gift)

737
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,870
(Jaeseung: Who gave it to you?)
(Seongmin: Hwi gave it to me)

738
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,330
(Hwi: Isn't it pretty?)

739
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,170
I want to smell it.
(Hwi: Isn't it pretty?)

740
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,460
It's so pretty.

741
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,270
(Jaeseung: Put some water in it)

742
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,400
-Cold water? -Cold water.

743
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,510
(Troubled)
-Cold water? -Cold water.

744
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,780
(Troubled)

745
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:07,420
(Jaeseung: I realized I'm jealous)

746
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,680
(Seongmin: Does the ribbon (go in the vase) too?)

747
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,870
(Hwi: I'll put this by my bed)

748
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,810
(Seongmin: Why? You gave this to me)

749
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:18,230
(Hwi: Should I put this here?)
(Seongmin: This is too white, so let's leave it here)

750
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,050
(Seongmin: Take this to our room)
(Hwi: Okay)

751
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,710
(Hwi puts the flowers Seongmin gave him on the dining table)

752
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,030
(Youngjoon: How should we decide (on the sleeping arrangement)?)

753
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,470
(Youngjoon: Do you want to choose? Do you want to know which bed is ours?)

754
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:33,830
I use this one. -I use this one.

755
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,310
(Youngjoon's bed) (Minseon's bed)
I use this one. -I use this one.

756

(Youngjoon: So you two can decide after discussing)

(Youngjoon: You get to choose)
(Myeongkyun: Okay)

759
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,970
(Youngjoon: I already know one of them)

760
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,200
(Youngjoon: So I didn't want to choose)

761
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,340
(Youngjoon: and left it up to the newbies)

762
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,930
(Minseon: I kind of want to share a bed with Myeongkyun)

763
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,220
(Hanmin: Which side do you prefer?)

764
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,270
(Minseon: Should we leave? You two can decide)

765
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,870
We'll find out later anyway.
(Minseon: Should we leave? You two can decide)

766
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,330
(Minseon: Should we leave? You two can decide)

767
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:02,990
(Youngjoon: Let's leave)

768
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:03,340
Let's erase this...
(Youngjoon: Let's leave)

769
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,310
Let's erase this...

770
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:08,910
((fickle) Youngjoon: I don't want to leave. Let's go there)

771
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:11,100
Anyway...

772
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,140
(In the meantime, Youngjoon and Minseon fixes the door sign)
Anyway...

773
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,100
(In the meantime, Youngjoon and Minseon fixes the door sign)

774
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,330
Let's just erase it.
(In the meantime, Youngjoon and Minseon fixes the door sign)

775
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,630
(Youngjoon: Should we write "Who & Who"?)
(Minseon: Sounds good. With the symbol '&'?)

776
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:24,160
(Youngjoon: We need more space, so I'll wipe this off too)
(Minseon: Just wipe everything off)

777
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,980
(Youngjoon: Let's keep the style)

778
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,230
(Youngjoon: It's drawn at the top)

779
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,810
(Minseon: The sun and moon?)

780
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,840
(Hanmin: I'm not a light sleeper)

781
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,330
(Hanmin: So I can sleep anywhere)

782
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,840
(Myeongkyun: I'm not really a light sleeper too)

783
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,440
(Myeongkyun: But I wake up early)

784
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,570
(Hanmin: Do you get up early?)
(Myeongkyun: Yes)

785

-So I... -Then...
(Hanmin: Do you get up early?)
(Myeongkyun: Yes)

786
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:46,480
(Hanmin: Let's ask them)
-So I... -Then...
(Hanmin: Do you get up early?)
(Myeongkyun: Yes)

787
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,180
(Hanmin: Let's ask them)

788
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,250
(Hanmin: who wakes up earlier)

789
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,310
(Youngjoon: Ask what?)

790
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,600
(Hanmin: Who gets up earlier?)

791
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,990
(Youngjoon: We woke up together)
(Minseon: We did wake up together)

792
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:57,820
-But Youngjoon got on his feet sooner. -Right.
(Youngjoon: We woke up together)
(Minseon: We did wake up together)

793
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,130
-But Youngjoon got on his feet sooner. -Right.

794
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,240
(Youngjoon: He stretches on his bed first)

795
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,150
(Minseon: I need time to fully wake up)

796
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,650
Meditation...
(Minseon: I need time to fully wake up)

797
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,340
(Minseon: To put it nicely, I need some time to meditate)
Meditation...

798
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,770
(Minseon: To put it nicely, I need some time to meditate)

799
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,960
I'll keep dozing off.
(Minseon: To put it nicely, I need some time to meditate)

800
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,490
-Carry on with your discussion. -Carry on.

801
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,120
(Myeongkyun: I'm the type to get up right away)

802
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,570
(Hanmin: Oh, then...)

803
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:24,250
(Hanmin: You'll sleep here. I'll sleep inside)
(Myeongkyun: Okay)

804
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:28,010
(Myeongkyun: I ended up sleeping in the same bed with Youngjoon)

805
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:30,490
(Myeongkyun: It's okay)

806
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:35,090
(Myeongkyun: I don't know his sleeping habits, but it should be fine)

807
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,480
-Have you decided? -Have you?

808
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,940
-Yes. -How did you choose?

809
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:42,330
(Youngjoon: How should I write our names (on the sign)?)
(Hanmin: I'll sleep (with Minseon), and Myeongkyun will (sleep with Youngjoon))

810
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,210
Okay.
(Youngjoon: How should I write our names (on the sign)?)

811
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,150
(Youngjoon: How should I write our names (on the sign)?)

812
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:41,400
(Youngjoon: How should I write our names (on the sign)?)

813
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,890
(Oh, right)

814
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,530
(Youngjoon: We weren't informed)

815
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,040
(Youngjoon: that we'll be sharing the beds)

816
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,530
(Youngjoon: That too...)

817
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,260
(Myeongkyun: What should we do?)

818
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,310
(Hanmin: It's a sudden choice)

819
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:16,310
(Youngjoon: We just used the bed like it was our own)

820
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:19,199
(Youngjoon: So if you'd prefer to share a bed...)

821
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,989
(Myeongkyun: I'm fine however)

822
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:27,800
(Youngjoon: When we first chose the beds,)

823
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,790
(Youngjoon: there were yellow blankets there and mint ones here)

824
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,620
(Youngjoon: I said the mint ones are pretty,)

825
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,900
(Youngjoon: so Minseon let me use the mint one)
(Hanmin: Oh)

826
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:42,170
(Youngjoon: Do we have to flip palms to decide?)

827
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:48,290
(Youngjoon: Actually, I really don't want to share (a bed) with Myeongkyun)

828
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,239
(Youngjoon: I tried my best)

829
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:56,120
(Youngjoon: I tried my best to come up with a way to change the arrangmement)

830
00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:00,650
(Hanmin: Let’s stick with it first)
(Youngjoon: Stick with it?)

831
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:04,420
(Hanmin: If it doesn't work, we can change it later)

832
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:08,270
(Youngjoon: If you're bothered by someone's sleeping habits, let's tell each other)
(Hanmin: Okay)

833
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,010
(Youngjoon: All four of us)

834
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,990
(Youngjoon: Since it was decided,)

835
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,420
(Youngjoon: I thought to try to make it work)

836
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,750
(Youngjoon: and went with it)

837
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,060
(What will happen in the quadruple room?)

838
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:22,940
(Hwi & Jaeseung spend time together while waiting for dinner)

839
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,860
-We end up not taking many photos. -Yes.
(Hwi & Jaeseung spend time together while waiting for dinner)

840
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,840
(Jaeseung: Want to take a photo together before revealing our ages?)

841
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,440
(Hwi: Yeah, I'd love that. In selfie mode?)

842
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,400
(Click)

843
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,130
Wait.

844
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,770
(Hwi: Oh, it's nice. Print it?)

845
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,350
(Jaeseung: I don't like it)
(Hwi: One more?)

846
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,930
(Jaeseung: Help me fix my hair)
(Hwi: Your hair?)

847
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,900
(Jaeseung: I took a photo with Hwi)

848
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:51,490
(Jaeseung: He touched me slightly a few times, which made my heart flutter)

849
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,990
(Hwi: I don't know what to do)

850
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:57,810
(Hwi: Will I make it worse?)

851
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:01,190
(They try again after his hair's fixed)

852
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,640
One, two, three.
(They try again after his hair's fixed)

853
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,530
(Hwi: Oops, I closed my eyes)

854
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,550
(Jaeseung: I think it looks good)

855
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,100
(Jaeseung: Again?)
(Hwi: Print it)

856
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:10,780
(Hwi: It looks good)

857
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:15,650
(Jaeseung: Print it?)
(Hwi: Okay)

858
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,890
(Taking a glance)
(Jaeseung: It looks like an old photo)

859
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:22,670
(Hwi: I should take photos of Seungjin cooking for him)

860
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,680
(Jaeseung: Hwi, I think you're kind)
(Hwi: Why?)
-Hwi, I think you're kind. -Why?

861
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,420
(Jaeseung: Hwi, I think you're kind)
(Hwi: Why?)

862
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,270
(Jaeseung: The way you speak...)

863
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:32,650
(Jaeseung: I noticed you help others take photos a lot,)
(Hwi: Yes)

864
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:36,120
(Jaeseung: even when they didn't ask you to)

865
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,540
(Jaeseung: It's not common)

866
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:45,120
(Hwi: Doesn't it look like a Japanese restaurant with an open-kitchen?)

867
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,160
(Jaeseung: There's the vibe)

868
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,150
(Jaeseung: My face looks so fat. Gosh)

869
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:57,700
(My face is fatter) (Puffed up!)

870
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,130
(Hwi: I look so fat)

871
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,500
(Jaeseung: I ate more than yesterday)

872
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,430
(Jaeseung: Actually I ate a lot yesterday too)

873
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,790
(Hwi: Let’s compare them)

874
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:12,440
(Hwi: But your hairstyle today's really nice)

875
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,600
(Jaeseung: Yes, it's only been a day...)

876
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,230
(Jaeseung: My hair's nice, but my cheeks are too full)

877
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,250
(Jaeseung: I didn't work out enough)

878
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,500
(Jaeseung: How much harder do I have to work out?)

879
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:26,980
(Another glance)

880
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,940
(Hwi: Looks like they're setting up the table)

881
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,610
(Jaeseung: Let's go)

882
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:32,860
Should I put it like that?

883
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,280
(The first dinner of the eight men)
Should I put it like that?

884
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,100
I think this looks better.

(Youngjoon: not even its wings)

945
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:17,660
(Embarrassed) (Hanmin: Since it's a mayfly)
(Youngjoon: not even its wings)

946
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,560
(Embarrassed) (Hanmin: Since it's a mayfly)

947
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,570
(Youngjoon: I was amazed and scared,)

948
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:27,550
(Youngjoon: but I thought he could protect me)

949
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:31,420
(Hwi: Oh, I was really impressed by that)

950
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,780
(Sincere) (Hwi: The tail was really... I've never seen one with such a long tail)

951
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,640
(Hanmin: Why are they all surprised?)

952
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,350
(Hanmin: Because I was born in Gangwon Province,)

953
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:45,380
(Hanmin: if there are bugs, you've to catch it before it gets in (the food))

954
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,000
(Jaeseung: I'm really curious about this)

955
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,330
(Jaeseung: How did (Hanmin & Myeongkyun) choose their dates?)

956
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,090
(Youngjoon: Oh, they don't know)

957
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:58,980
(Minseon: Right, (Jaeseung & Seungjin) don't know)
(Youngjoon: They were busy getting close)

958
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,220
(Jaeseung: We were the "Please Get Closer" team)
(Minseon: Please Get Closer)

959
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,600
(Youngjoon: By our keywords)

960
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,670
(Jaeseung: Keywords?)
(Youngjoon: Yes)

961
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:09,230
(Youngjoon: A phrase that represents each of us)

962
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:10,770
(Jaeseung: What did you choose?)

963
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,410
Here, you can start.
(Jaeseung: What did you choose?)

964
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,400
(Jaeseung: What did you choose?)

965
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,990
(Myeongkyun: I was considering between two)

966
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,140
(Myeongkyun: and chose "Self-esteem Guardian...)

967
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:24,250
(Myeongkyun: with beautiful eyes and hands")

968
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,780
(Minseon: What's the other one?)

969
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,020
(Myeongkyun: I don't remember)

970
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,030
I skipped...
(Myeongkyun: I don't remember)

971
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,220
(Myeongkyun: I skipped two animals...)

972
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,190
(Youngjoon: Skipped two animals?)

973
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:37,300
(Youngjoon: Skipped the cat and dog)
(Myeongkyun: I skipped the old cat and the dog)

974
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,880
(Myeongkyun: "Playful Tofu")

975
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,990
(Myeongkyun: "Playful Tofu")
(Youngjoon: Are you "Playful Tofu"?)

976
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,280
-"Playful Tofu"? -I think it's you.
(Myeongkyun: "Playful Tofu")
(Youngjoon: Are you "Playful Tofu"?)

977
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,480
(Hwi acting confused)
(Seongmin: I think you're "Playful Tofu")
-"Playful Tofu"? -I think it's you.

978
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,990
You're in the same group anyway.
(Hwi acting confused)
(Seongmin: I think you're "Playful Tofu")

979
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,150
(Minseon: Wow, us too)

980
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,040
(Youngjoon: (Hanmin) was choosing between (me and Minseon) too)

981
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,960
Really?
(Youngjoon: (Hanmin) was choosing between (me and Minseon) too)

982
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,600
(Youngjoon: (Hanmin) was choosing between (me and Minseon) too)

983
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,230
(Youngjoon: Myeongkyun's choices were (Seongmin and Hwi) too)

984
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,530
They'd have ended up in the same places.
(Youngjoon: Myeongkyun's choices were (Seongmin and Hwi) too)

985
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,280
(Youngjoon: Myeongkyun's choices were (Seongmin and Hwi) too)

986
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:57,570
(Hwi: Why didn't he choose me instead (of Seongmin)?)

987
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:00,250
(Youngjoon: If they chose the same person, four people might have met)

988
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,110
(Oh)

989
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:02,940
Right.
(Oh)

990
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,150
(Minseon: We met as a foursome for the first time too)

991
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,550
(Jaeseung: How did you choose (the card)?)

992
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:14,700
(Hanmin: I chose "All-rounder with beautiful eyes" and...)

993
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,210
(Youngjoon: Smiling eyes)
(Hanmin: Right. Smiling eyes)

994
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:21,260
(Hanmin: The other one is "A large dog who doesn't match his size")

995
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,140
(Hanmin: Among these two...)

996
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:26,740
(Hwi: Oh, I know who it is. It’s you, right?)

997
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:31,490
("Large dog")
(Hanmin: After a long time, I chose the "large dog")

998
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:34,010
(Myeongkyun: Based on first impressions,)

999
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:41,190
(Myeongkyun: personality-wise, I was most interested in Minseon)

1000
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:45,240
(Minseon: Let's decide who's making breakfast tomorrow)
(Myeongkyun: Tomorrow?)

1001
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,830
(Minseon: Who wants to do it?)

1002
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:50,580
(Jaeseung: If no one wants to, can I do it?)

1003
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,310
(Sure)

1004
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:52,660
Like sandwiches. sandwiches.
(Sure)

1005
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,340
(Jaeseung: Sandwiches)
(Myeongkyun: Sandwiches? I'll be the sub...)
Like sandwiches. sandwiches.

1006
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,330
-I'll be the sub... -Subway?
(Jaeseung: Sandwiches)
(Myeongkyun: Sandwiches? I'll be the sub...)

1007
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:55,410
-I'll be the sub... -Subway?

1008
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,220
(Just kidding)
-I'll be the sub... -Subway?

1009
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,170
No.
(Just kidding)

-Sub. -Sub.
(Just kidding)

1011

(Jaeseung: Oh, to help me)
(Myeongkyun: I'll be the sub-chef)

1013
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,460
(Jaeseung: Help)
(Myeongkyun: Yes)

1014
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,710
(Youngjoon: Jaeseung, I think (you, Myeongkyun, and I) get up the earliest)

1015
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:06,090
(Youngjoon: (Myeongkyun) said he gets up early)
(Jaeseung: Yeah?)

1016
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,470
(Youngjoon: Call me too if I'm awake. Or not, if you don't want to)

1017
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,150
What could it be?

1018
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,030
(Men's phones ringing at the same time)

1019
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,230
What is it? I haven't read it.
(Men's phones ringing at the same time)

1020

(Jaeseung: Here we go)
What is it? I haven't read it.

Wow.
(Wow!)

1024
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,640
Next, you can reveal
(Wow!)

1025
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,620
your name, age, occupation and so on.

1026
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:27,640
You can also ask questions freely.

1027
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:31,060
(Nervous)

1028
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,660
(Minseon: Let's choose who we're most curious about)

1029
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:41,770

(Youngjoon: Based on occupation or age?)

1030
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:46,650
(Minseon: (Occupation or age), whichever. Who you're most curious about)

1031

Why is it always 3:3?

1042
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:04,700
Three votes each?

1043

(They're most curious about Jaeseung & Youngjoon's personal info)
Three votes each?

1044

1047
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:13,510
(Youngjoon: I'll also check if you're really older than me)

1048
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:18,130
(Seungjin: I'm most curious about Jaeseung, who I went on a date with)

1049

(Minseon: We made our phone calls to each other)

1050

00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:31,330
(Jaeseung: After knowing his personal info,)

1247
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:34,010
(Jaeseung: I'm not as interested in Hwi anymore)

1248
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:37,540
(Seongmin: I didn't expect him to be 7 years younger than me)

1249
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,770
(Seongmin: I was quite shocked)

1250
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:43,710
(Minseon: So how should we address each other?)
(Youngjoon: Let's not be formal)

1251
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:45,230
(Seongmin: Drop the honorifics?)

1252
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:48,930
(Minseon: Drop the honorifics?)
(Youngjoon: Let's just speak informally?)

1253
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:50,420
(Hwi: Informally?)
(Youngjoon: Then we can get closer sooner)

1254
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,670
(Seongmin: Let's say our (ages) once again)

1255
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,800
(Seungjin: 21) (Hwi: 22) (Minseon: 24) (Myeongkyun: 25)
(Hanmin: 27) (Youngjoon: 28) (Seongmin: 29) (Jaeseung: 33)

1256
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,880
Why do you have to say it again?
(Seungjin: 21) (Hwi: 22) (Minseon: 24) (Myeongkyun: 25)
(Hanmin: 27) (Youngjoon: 28) (Seongmin: 29) (Jaeseung: 33)

1257
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:01,720
(Let's clean up)

1258
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:02,130
(After self-introductions, how have their affections changed?)

1259
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:03,010
Thank you for the food.
(After self-introductions, how have their affections changed?)

1260
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:03,930
Thank you for the food.
(After self-introductions, how have their affections changed?)

1261
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:05,990
-Thank you for the food. -The chef...
(After self-introductions, how have their affections changed?)

1262
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:06,880
(After self-introductions, how have their affections changed?)

1263
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,850
(Hwi: I’ll do the dishes)

1264
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:12,200
(Myeongkyun: Here's where the dishes are done)

1265
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,850
(Hwi: I had such a great (meal). I should do the dishes)

1266
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:17,470
(Seongmin: I'll do it too)
(Hwi: Really?)

1267
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:18,920
(Seongmin: I should help out too)

1268
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,070
(Hwi: Then let's do it face to face)

1269
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:27,300
(Men cleaning up together)

1270
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:35,540
(Hanmin: Are you washing on both sides?)
(Seongmin: Yes, doing the dishes)

1271
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,240
(Hwi: Do you have that over there? Dishwashing liquid)
(Seongmin: Yes, here)

1272
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,570
(Seongmin: Put it there. Let's share)

1273
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:53,560
(Hwi: I wanted to do the dishes face to face with Seongmin)

1274
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,770
(Hwi: So I asked him to do them with me)

1275
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:00,680
(Jaeseung: Can I go inside and rest?)
(Youngjoon: Get some rest)

1276
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:06,300
(Jaeseung: I'm going to rest)

1277
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:11,300
(Jaeseung: I want to be alone)

1278
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,560
(So annoying...)

1279
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:24,810
(Ugh, so annoying...)

1280
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:29,250
(Jaeseung: The person I was interested in...)

1281
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32,120
(Jaeseung: is much younger than I thought)

1282
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:39,020
(Jaeseung troubled after the self-introductions)

1283
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:44,400
((Whispering) Youngjoon: When you're done cleaning up, go there...)

1284
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,840
(Myeongkyun: Oh, when I'm done...)
(Youngjoon: For a while, at the entertainment room)

1285
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,690
(Myeongkyun: Oh, okay)

1286
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:55,090
(Oh, a cat!)

1287
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:58,460
(Meow) (Youngjoon: A cat? A cat came in?)

1288
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:59,740
Hold on.
(Meow) (Youngjoon: A cat? A cat came in?)

1289
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:00,300
(Meow) (Youngjoon: A cat? A cat came in?)

1290
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:06,470
(Cute)

1291
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,640
(The two face each other for the first time)

1292
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,570
(Myeongkyun: Gosh)

1293
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:16,480
(Youngjoon: You didn't know too, right?)
(Myeongkyun: Yeah)

1294
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:17,940
What's going on?

1295
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:25,290
(Youngjoon: I was so shocked I froze in an instant)
(Myeongkyun: I... Me too)

1296
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:32,010
(Youngjoon: Well... How should I put it? I didn't expect you to show up)

1297
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:37,710
(Myeongkyun: I expected one familiar face)

1298
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:41,180
(Youngjoon: But not me)
(Myeongkyun: I never thought it'd be you)

1299
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:45,100
(Myeongkyun: It's a problem)
(Youngjoon: It's not)

1300
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:46,230
We didn't date anyway.

1301
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:47,810
("We didn't date anyway")
We didn't date anyway.

1302
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:49,850
("We didn't date anyway")

1303
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:53,370
(Youngjoon: We were in the flirting phase)

1304
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:55,580
(Youngjoon: But he seemed uninterested in a relationship)

1305
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:57,110
(Youngjoon: Since he wasn't serious,)

1306
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:59,150
(Youngjoon: I was fine with letting him go)

1307
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:01,820
(Youngjoon: and I stopped liking him,)

1308
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,130
(Youngjoon: so I gave up on him)

1309
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:05,270
(So why did he join a dating show?)

1310
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:06,870
I'm confused about that too.
(So why did he join a dating show?)

1311
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:08,330
(So why did he join a dating show?)

1312
00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:13,830
(Myeongkyun: As a romantic partner...)

1313
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:17,370
(Myeongkyun: I'd say it's not impossible)

1314
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:22,560
(Myeongkyun: Actually, I think it's the opposite. I don't think (Youngjoon))

1315
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,620
(Myeongkyun: felt romantically attracted to me)

1316
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:30,540
(Myeongkyun: First of all, because I'm younger...)

1317
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,760
(Myeongkyun: I think he wasn't interested in me)

1318
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,840
(Myeongkyun: romantically)

1319
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:41,200
-(What happened between the two?)
-How should I put it?

1320
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,910
(I stood on the second floor, looking down to see when he'd come)

1321
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:51,510
(But he didn't come even after a long time)

1322
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:54,190
(Beckoning sign)

1323
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,860
(He seems to think about it too lightly)

1324
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:01,650
(That's why I'm angry)

1325
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,720
(I feel like he's one-sidedly)

1326
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,020
(drawing the line between us)

1327
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,970
(Men's conflicts begin)

1328
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,520
(To be honest, I really didn't want to make)

1329
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,560
(the second phone call)

1330
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,140
(I tried my best to avoid him after the call)

1331
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:21,130
(I didn't even look at him)

1332
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:24,720
(I've been waiting...)

1333
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,650
(I became confused and troubled)

1334
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:33,770
(It feels like I betrayed him)

1335
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:40,060
(One of us must've been severely mistaken about it)

1336
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,130
(Men's House in chaos)

1337
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:42,860
He must've been disappointed.
(Men's House in chaos)

1338
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:42,920
(Men's House in chaos)

1339
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:43,990
Who do I think I am?
(Men's House in chaos)

1340
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:44,780
(Men's House in chaos)
