00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,740
(Episode 10: The man I'm thinking of right now)

10
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:44,260
(Hwi & Seungjin's date location is within a green forest)

11
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,780
(Seungjin: What could it be?)

12
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,020
(Hwi: This building is really nice)

13
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,700
(Seungjin: Is this a cafe?)

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,980
(Hwi: Cafe? Isn't it a place to make things?)

15
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,380
(Seungjin: Firstly, I can strongly feel the phytoncides)

16
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,460
(Seungjin: It smells so good now)

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:06,140
(Hwi: Because Seungjin and I often talk about our feelings,)

18
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:14,539
(Hwi: I just want to have a casual chat and have a good time together)

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,150
What is it?

20
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,620
(Hwi: It's pottery!)

21
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,910
It must be pottery.

22
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,500
(Seungjin: I said I wanted to go to a pottery workshop on the first day)

23
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,860
(Seungjin: I wanted to go to a pottery workshop)
(Hwi: Me too)

24
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,780
(Seungjin: I'm comfortable with Hwi)

25
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,539
(Seungjin: I think it'll be fun)

26
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:44,140
(Pottery workshop date that is to their liking)

27
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,460
(Teacher: Practice making a small cup first)

28
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,900
(Teacher: From the second one, I'll help you make what you want to make)

29
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,830
Okay.
(Teacher: From the second one, I'll help you make what you want to make)

30
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:54,700
Wrap it with your hands like this.

31
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,710
(The first one is to make a cup)
Wrap it with your hands like this.

(The first one is to make a cup)

33
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,690
Then try hugging it like this.
(The first one is to make a cup)

34
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,640
How does it feel?

35
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,260
(Wow)

36
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,720
How is it?

37
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:09,990
(Hwi: Very soft)

38
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,400
-Right? -Yes.
(Hwi: Very soft)

39
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,660
(Softness that calms the heart)

40
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:18,260
(Seungjin: Wow, this is really...)

41
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,340
(Seungjin: To calm my body and mind...)

42
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,900
(Seungjin: Firstly, I've...)

43
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,860
(Seungjin: repeatedly said)

44
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,460
(Seungjin: I wanted to go to a pottery workshop)

45
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,500
(Seungjin: I was so excited. It was so fun)

46
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,460
(Hwi: It's soothing)

47
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,020
(Hwi: It’s my first time (making pottery). I really liked it)

48
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,140
(Hwi: It feels good too)

49
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,800
(It's hard to make a round pillar)

50
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:49,900
Yes.
(It's hard to make a round pillar)

51
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,220
(Teacher: Those who are good at that are good at controlling the pottery wheel)
Yes.
(It's hard to make a round pillar)

52
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,260
(Teacher: Those who are good at that are good at controlling the pottery wheel)

53
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,460
(Hwi: I've made pottery before. But this is my first time using a pottery wheel)

54
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,780
(Focused) (Hwi: It’s really hard)

55
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,910
I know.
(Focused) (Hwi: It’s really hard)

56
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,740
(Focused) (Hwi: It’s really hard)

57
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,900
(Hwi: It's taking shape)

58
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,180
(Hwi: More and more like a cup...)

59
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,620
(Hwi: Seungjin and I were both so focused)

60
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,220
(Hwi: on making ours look good)

61
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,579
(Hwi: We forgot to talk)

62
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:26,220
(Hwi: It might seem like we're not close)

63
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,620
(Seungjin: Mine is done)

64
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,820
Good.
(Seungjin: Mine is done)

65
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,300
(Seungjin: Mine is done)

66
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,290
Pull it out harder.

67
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,780
(I'm done too)

68
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,820
(Seungjin: I'm most worried about this)
(Oh no)

69
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,020
(Hwi: It'll be funny if you drop it now)

70
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,820
(Dangerous)

71
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,420
(Phew)

72
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,280
Yours is voluptuous.

73
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,630
(Staggering)

74
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,690
See.
(Staggering)

75
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,540
(Seungjin: You get me now?)

76
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,570
Put it here, right?

77
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,210
Good.

78
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,980
This is the first item made with a pottery wheel.

79
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,860
(Hwi: It’s like a mud festival)

80
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,500
(Seungjin: I'm so happy)

81
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,110
(Seungjin: I know why people come to make pottery)

82
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,240
-Doesn't it feel nice to mold clay? -Yes.
(Seungjin: I know why people come to make pottery)

83
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,790
Next, make what you want.

84
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,690
Tell me what you want to make.

85
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,340
(Seungjin: I suddenly want to make a jar)

86
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,100
(Teacher: Like a vase?)
(Seungjin: Yes)

87
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,380
(Hwi: I... want to make a pasta plate)

88
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,220
-Didn't you have the step of forming the hole? -Yes.

89
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,200
(Starting the second artwork: Seungjin's vase & Hwi's pasta plate)
-Didn't you have the step of forming the hole? -Yes.

90
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,320
(Starting the second artwork: Seungjin's vase & Hwi's pasta plate)

91
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,720
This time, put it in deeper. All the way.
(Starting the second artwork: Seungjin's vase & Hwi's pasta plate)

92
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,380
(Hwi: It’s so fun)
(Seungjin: It's really fun)

93
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,659
(Hwi: It's so therapeutic)

94
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,220
(Hwi: It’s so therapeutic)

95
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,820
(It feels so great?)

96
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,100
(Seungjin: I knew it)

97
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,140
(Seungjin: I knew we'd be so focused)

98
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:13,980
(Hwi: Really. This is the most concentrated I've been)

99
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,330
(Hwi's paste plate is taking shape)

100
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,550
It's taking shape.
(Hwi's paste plate is taking shape)

101
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,330
(Hwi's paste plate is taking shape)

102
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,600
It looks like a plate.
(Hwi's paste plate is taking shape)

103
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,060
-Isn't it amazing? -Yes.

104
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,420
(Teacher: You made it yourself)

105
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,820
(Hwi: I have to eat (pasta) with this)

106
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,000
(Seungjin's vase is taking shape too)

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,830
Awesome.
(Seungjin's vase is taking shape too)

108
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:29,980
(Seungjin's vase is taking shape too)

109
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,110
What are you making?
(Seungjin's vase is taking shape too)

110
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,390
(Seungjin's vase is taking shape too)

111
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,170
-A vase. -A vase?
(Seungjin's vase is taking shape too)

112
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,260
(Hwi: I’ll share the flowers on the third floor with you)
(Seungjin: Great)

113
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,780
(Seungjin: Maybe because I feel comfortable with Hwi,)

114
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,300
(Seungjin: I could focus in making the pottery)

115
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,060
(Seungjin: It's really nice)

116
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,580
(Seungjin: Also, when making pottery, I didn't think about other things)

117
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,180
Stop here.

118
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,640
(Hwi's pasta plate is finished first)
Stop here.

119
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,060
(Hwi's pasta plate is finished first)

120
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,500
(Hwi: It already looks pretty)

121
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,380
(Hwi: How is it?)
(Seungjin: Oh~)

122
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,060
((Sad) Hwi: When I picked it up, I made a dent)

123
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:06,260
Don't worry about that.

124
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,410
(Finger print)
Don't worry about that.

125
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,300
(Finger print)

126
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:09,660
-Are you happy with it? -Yes.

127
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,350
(Next, Seungjin's vase is done)
-Are you happy with it? -Yes.

(Next, Seungjin's vase is done)

129
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,930
Then stop.
(Next, Seungjin's vase is done)

130
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,180
(Hwi: This is the most nerve-racking moment)

131
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,940
(Carefully)

132
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,130
(Thump)

133
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:23,980
You're afraid to ruin it.
(Thump)

134
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,220
You're afraid to ruin it.

135
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,600
I'm nervous.

136
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,420
(Putting down the precious vase carefully)

137
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,409
(Seungjin: But I think it’s nice to have a fingerprint too)

138
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:42,640
-Do you like it? -Yes.
(Seungjin: But I think it’s nice to have a fingerprint too)

139
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,060
(Even satisfied with the mistakes in their precious works)

140

(Hwi & Seungjin's therapeutic pottery workshop date)

141
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:01,980
(The two go to the cafe after making pottery)

142
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,660
(Hwi: Wow, the view is awesome)

143
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,560
(Seungjin: Sit here?)

144
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,860
Sit here.
(Seungjin: Sit here?)

145
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,700
(Seungjin: Sit here?)

146
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:15,390
(With the window as a photo frame, the view's like a painting)

147
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,920
This place is great.
(With the window as a photo frame, the view's like a painting)

(Hwi: The view here is really great)
(Seungjin: I know)

150
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,900
(Seungjin: It's great)

151
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,060
(Isn't it better for us to hang out?)

152
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,420
(I'm really happy)

153
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,140
(Seungjin: I feel comfortable)

154
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,460
(Hwi: Like besties)

155
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,950
Very comfortable.
(Hwi: Like besties)

156
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,540
(Hwi: Like besties)

157
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,390
(Seungjin: Really. I like that I did what I wanted to)

158
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:39,659
Right.
(Seungjin: Really. I like that I did what I wanted to)

159
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:39,990
(Seungjin: And I did it with someone I'm at ease with)
(Hwi: Yes)
Right.
(Seungjin: Really. I like that I did what I wanted to)

160

(Today is a relaxing and carefree day)

162
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,940
(Hwi: Are you going to give (the pottery you made) to anyone?)
(Seungjin: Me?)

163
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,300
(Seungjin: I can't bear to give it away)

164
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,540
(Will you keep it for yourself?)

165
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,460
(Seungjin: Anyway, for the past 4 days,)

166
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,860
(Seungjin: no one's called me)

167
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,060
(Seungjin: If someone calls me,)

168
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,260
(Seungjin: I might give it to him)

169
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,060
(Seungjin: Are you going to give it to Seongmin?)

170
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,820
(Give what? Haha)

171
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,580
(Hwi: I wanted to give (Seongmin)...)

172
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,740
(Hwi: At the first date, I gave Seongmin flowers)

173
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,660
(Seungjin: So you wanted to give him a vase?)

174
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,700
(Hwi: So I thought it'd be nice to give him a vase)

175
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,860
(Hwi: So I'll give him a vase)

176
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,900
(Seungjin: So persistent)
(Hwi: That's how it is)

177
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:42,059
(Seungjin: Hwi is in love with Seongmin)

178
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,820
(Seungjin: He's so infatuated)

179
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,220
(Seungjin: Looking at him...)

180
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,860
(Seungjin: He's cute and very innocent)

181
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,020
(Seungjin: Didn't you talk to Seongmin alone yesterday?)

182
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,180
(Hwi: Yes)
(Seungjin: What did you talk about?)

183
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,780
(All kinds of... what I feel deep down)

184
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,100
(Seungjin: So now... do you think (you & Seongmin) will work out?)

185
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,300
(Hwi: I really don’t know. I don't know)

186
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,780
(Hwi: That's why I've been talking to him)

187
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,420
(Seungjin: Your feelings are clear)

188
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,820
(Seungjin: But Seongmin's feelings are still uncertain?)
(Hwi: Yes)

189
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,500
(Gosh...)

190
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,060
(Hwi: But I’ve tried my best)

191
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,300
(Hwi: There's nothing more to say)

192
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,100
(Hwi: There's nothing more to do too)

193
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,260
(Seungjin: Yes... You gave your all)

194
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,780
(I have no pride in front of him)

195
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,570
(Here are the drinks and desserts)

196
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,180
Here's your order.
(Here are the drinks and desserts)

197
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:44,640
(Here are the drinks and desserts)

198
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,170
-Thank you. -Is this yours?
(Here are the drinks and desserts)

199
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:46,190
(Here are the drinks and desserts)

200
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,370
-Berry berry? -Yes.
(Here are the drinks and desserts)

201
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,780
-It looks good. -Thank you.

202
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,660
(Seungjin: Let's see who takes better photos)

203
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,840
(Seungjin: Oh, you're even standing up to take photos?)

204
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:58,980
When taking food photos...
(Seungjin: Oh, you're even standing up to take photos?)

205
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,820
When taking food photos...

206
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,900
(The two are sincere about the photos)
When taking food photos...

207
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,130
(The two are sincere about the photos)

208
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,380
Yes.
(The two are sincere about the photos)

209
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,060
(The two are sincere about the photos)

210
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,180
(No blank space)

211
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,740
(Click)

212
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,540
(Oh)

213
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,340
(I'm satisfied!)

214
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,500
(Mine look like Europe)

215
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,980
(It's amazing)

216
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,020
They can use them as promotional photos.
(It's amazing)

217
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,940
They can use them as promotional photos.

218
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,000
(Immersed)
They can use them as promotional photos.

219
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,740
(Immersed)

220
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,960
Let me see.

221
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,150
Awesome.

222
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,460
(They feel like they're on a trip)

223
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,500
It's like London.

224
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,900
(Seungjin: It's different indeed)

225
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,170
Let's try this.

226
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,580
(Seungjin: Thank you for the food)

227
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,420
(Wow!)

228
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,980
(Seungjin: Did I act like an old man?)

229
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,720
(Oh!!)

230
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,260
The smell!
(Oh!!)

231
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,140
The smell!

232
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,560
(Hwi: This is amazing)

233
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,610
Awesome.
(Hwi: This is amazing)

234
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,640
(Yum)

235
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,410
-Is this basil? -Yes.
(Yum)

236
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,380
(Yum)

237
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,500
(Second therapeutic session after the pottery session)

238
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,660
(Hwi: Is it delicious? Amazing? Moving?)

239
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,860
(Hwi: It's really delicious)

240
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,900
(Seungjin: But you chose me to be your date today)

241
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,460
(Seungjin: What's the exact reason?)

242
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,880
-Today? -Yes.
(Seungjin: What's the exact reason?)

243
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,740
(Hwi: When I got the card, it said)

244
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,580
(Hwi: to date someone you've never dated)

245
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,700
(Hwi: I thought of you right away)

246
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,220
(Hwi: because when I'm with you... You're good at comforting me, and we're close friends)

247
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:35,220
(Hwi: I feel comfortable with you. So I asked you out right away)

248
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,060
(Seungjin: Thanks to you, I had so much fun)

249
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,300
(Seungjin: Pottery workshop)
(Hwi: It was so awesome)

250
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,260
(Seungjin: So exciting)

251
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:49,620
(Seungjin: From the third day, I started overthinking things)

252
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,060
(Hwi: Why?)

253
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,700
(Seungjin: First, I like being alone)

254
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,020
(Seungjin: So 8 people living together at all times)

255
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,380
(Seungjin: is a lot to me)

256
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,060
(That's right)

257
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
(Seungjin: And on the third day,)

258
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,760
(Seungjin: a few major things happened)

259
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,750
Yes.
(Seungjin: a few major things happened)

260
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:18,700
(Seungjin: After all those things, I felt a little...)

261
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,180
(Seungjin: I felt confused)

262
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,980
(Seungjin: I don't have anyone I like a lot either)

263
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,500
(Seungjin: There's no one who's expressed interest in me too)

264
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,860
(Seungjin: So, I felt...)

265
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,580
(Hwi: But before, who was it... Jaeseung?)

266
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,980
(Hwi: Didn't you say you were interested in him?)

267
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:50,060
(Seungjin: On the third day, when I saw)

268
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,140
(Seungjin: Jaeseung take Seongmin out,)

269
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:58,660
(Seungjin: I felt like he's very sure)

270
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,460
(Seungjin: about Seongmin right now. So,)

271
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,980
(Seungjin: I don't want to intrude)

272
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:13,300
(Hwi: Does Jaeseung know you have feelings for him?)

273
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,020
(Seungjin: I doubt (Jaeseung) knows what I feel)

274
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,100
(Seungjin: about him)

275
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,030
(Seungjin: Since I've never told him)

276
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,260
(Hwi: For me, to Seongmin and Jaeseung,)
(Seungjin: Since I've never told him)

277
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:24,420
(Hwi: For me, to Seongmin and Jaeseung,)

278
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,180
(Hwi: I was honest with both of them)

279
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,340
(Hwi: I told them my feelings honestly)

280
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,700
(Hwi: After that, I think I became more sure)

281
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,220
(Hwi: about my feelings)

282
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:41,020
(Hwi: So I think it’s good to tell him)

283
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,540
(Hwi: Tell him first and then come to a conclusion)

284
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:51,580
(Seungjin's conflicted after Hwi's advice)

285
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:56,220
(Seungjin: With my personality... I can't do that)

286
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,210
(Seungjin: So I had a headache until yesterday)

287
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,750
The third day.
(Seungjin: So I had a headache until yesterday)

288
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,140
(Hwi: I kept breaking down on the third day)

289
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,580
(Hwi: I'm someone who likes people)

290
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,020
(Hwi: I get along well with people around me)

291
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,350
(But it’s the first time I kind of disliked people)

292
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,410
It's the first time feeling this way.
(But it’s the first time I kind of disliked people)

293
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:27,100
(Hwi: So I'm not used to myself being like this)

294
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,860
(Seungjin: After coming to Men's House,)

295
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,460
(Seungjin: wow, I didn't know I could be like this)

296
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:37,140
(Hwi: Yes)

297
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,340
(Seungjin: What came to my mind until yesterday was)

298
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:44,220
(Seungjin: that I'm more timid than I thought)
(Hwi: You?)

299
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,900
(Hwi: I think you're more lively than I thought)

300
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,580
(Hwi: Compared to my first impression of you)

301
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:55,020
(Seungjin: To be honest, that (lively) self)

302
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:59,700
(Seungjin: isn't my true self)

303
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,620
(Seungjin: To make sure everyone has fun...)

304
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:06,900
(Seungjin: I don't like to show my feelings. That's why)

305
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,260
(Seungjin: But how I am when I'm with you...)

306
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,940
(Seungjin: When I'm really energetic with you, it's genuine)

307
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,020
(Hwi: It looked so genuine)

308
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:25,700
(Hwi: While I've been (in Men's House), I think I've found a new side of myself)
(Seungjin: I think so too)

309
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,940
(Hwi: I didn't know I was such a crybaby)

310
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,740
(Hwi: I've never cried in front of anyone before)

311
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:38,060
(Seungjin: All our conversations were real)

312
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,900
(Seungjin: You could say I've expressed my innermost feelings)

313
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:49,220
(Seungjin: That conversation impressed me the most)

314
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,980
(Hwi: I was honest with him)

315
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,580
(Hwi: That means I feel more comfortable (with Seungjin))

316
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,580
(Hwi: I think we became closer as friends. So I’m grateful)

317
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,660
(Q. How was your date today?)

318
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,260
(Very, very satisfied. Perfect)

319
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:21,180
(Hwi & Seungjin's relaxing, enjoyable, and therapeutic date)

320
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:27,580
(It's already dinner time)

321
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,780
(After Youngjoon & Myeongkyun left, Jaeseung & Minseon are left alone)

322
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,780
More and more spectacles every day.
(After Youngjoon & Myeongkyun left, Jaeseung & Minseon are left alone)

323
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,060
(After Youngjoon & Myeongkyun left, Jaeseung & Minseon are left alone)

324
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,220
It's really shocking.
(After Youngjoon & Myeongkyun left, Jaeseung & Minseon are left alone)

325
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,180
(Minseon: I think today's been the most peaceful)

326
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,660
(Jaeseung: It's been peaceful so far)

327
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,380
I don't know what will happen at night. -Yeah.
(Jaeseung: It's been peaceful so far)

328
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,380
I don't know what will happen at night. -Yeah.

(Jaeseung: I can't ignore it)

331
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,460
(Jaeseung: Anyway, everyone knows everything now)

332
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,100
(Jaeseung: Who likes whom and the developments)

333
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:56,820
(Jaeseung: I'm in a love triangle with Hwi and Seongmin)

334
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,980
(Jaeseung: I'm a bit isolated)

335
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,140
(Jaeseung: At least Seungjin's beside Hwi)

336
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,339
(Jaeseung: (Hwi) has someone who)

337
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,900
(Jaeseung: he can talk to)

338
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,780
(Jaeseung: And I felt that strongly during the anonymous chat)

339
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:19,700
(Jaeseung: Seungjin was with Hwi the whole time)

340
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,940
(Jaeseung: And the sound of them talking even reached my room)

341
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,700
(Jaeseung: I felt...)

342
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,220
(Jaeseung: It's not their fault)

343
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,580
(Jaeseung: But as a listener, it upset me)

344
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,580
(To be honest, I hate him)

345
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,980
(Jaeseung: I hate (Hwi), but I understand him too)

346
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,900
(Jaeseung: But I still feel bitter, you know?)

347
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:50,580
(Jaeseung: I can understand (Hwi), but I feel bitter)

348
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,300
(Jaeseung: I didn't hear their conversation clearly)

349
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,460
(Jaeseung: It's muffled, but I could hear my name and whatnot)

350
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,220
(Jaeseung: Since it's easier to catch familiar words)

351
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,700
(Jaeseung: They seemed to have mentioned me and Seongmin)

352
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,020
(Jaeseung: Just hearing it upset me)

353
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,250
-I'm hungry. -Are they all home?

354
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,340
They should be here.

355
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:15,430
(Seongmin & Hanmin coming back from their date)
They should be here.

(Minseon: What did you do on your date?)

366
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,420
(Seongmin: We went to a exhibition hall)
(Minseon: Really?)

367
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,740
(Minseon: They went to an amusement park)

368
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,940
(Really?)

369
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,540
(Hanmin: I said I wanted to go to an amusement park!)

370
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,260
(Ah!)

371
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,740
(Seongmin: But I had fun)

Yeah?
(Seongmin: But I had fun)

373
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,660
(Minseon: What exhibition?)

374
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:47,260
(Seongmin: We went to Lee Jae Hyo Gallery that's filled with wooden sculptures)
(Minseon: Oh, really? I've heard of the name)

375
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,220
(It was really nice)

376
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,500
(Hanmin: I said I wanted to go to an amusement park!)

377
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,710
We're in sync.

378
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,020
(Minseon: Both must've been fun. Exhibition and amusement park)

379
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,580
(Hanmin: If I went to the amusement park with Youngjoon,)

380
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,220
(Hanmin: I'd have had a great (date))

381
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,940
(Hanmin: Of course, since (Youngjoon and Jaeseung) had fun,)

382
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,780
(Hanmin: it's a relief)

383
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,100
(Hanmin: But to be honest, I'm jealous)

384
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,700
(Hanmin: Actually I think exhibitions are nice,)

385
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,620
(Hanmin: but I prefer active stuff)

386
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,060
(Jaeseung: The amusement park date was really dynamic)
(I'm so jealous)

387

(Jaeseung: The swing carousel rotated very fast)

388
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,200

389
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,580
There are many who prefer active stuff.

394
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,980
(Hanmin: Based on what I've heard, (Seongmin) likes non-active dates)

395
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,980
(Hanmin: Hwi and Seungjin also like non-active ones)

396

397
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,220

(Minseon: Really? Let me see)

398

(Jaeseung: as a date)

400
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,860

401
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,940
(Jaeseung: I don't know either)

402
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,180

(Minseon: Did you check your room?)

405
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,020
(Room?) (Your bed!)

406
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,560
(Why?) (Your bed!)

407
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,460

(Seongmin: What is it?)

411
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,770
(Minseon: Go check again)

412
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,000
What is it?
(Minseon: Go check again)

413
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:26,420

(Minseon: You can eat the leaves too)

Cooking together is fun.

Okay.

692
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,540
(Hwi: At that moment, he came over to face the fan at me)

693
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,540
(Hwi: He was worried I might get hot)

694
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,900
(My heart fluttered)

695
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,260
(Seongmin: But is everyone back?)

696
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,140
(Seongmin: Right. You're the last to come back)

697

(After chatting, Jaeseung & Hanmin return to the first floor)

699
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,650
You're sweating. Just wipe it here.

700
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:15,670
Okay.

Are you done?

00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:31,580
(Seongmin: If Jaeseung saw me holding the fan...)

709
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,500
(Seongmin: Will he be upset?)

710
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,220
(Seongmin: Would he misunderstand?)

711

-We shouldn't have scooped out their rice. -Right.

00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,940
(Seungjin: Anyway, among eight of us, whenever there's a problem,)

784
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,100
(Seungjin: it doesn't just apply to them)

785
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,340
(Seungjin: The subtle hostility they share)

786
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,380
(Seungjin: spread throughout the group)

787

00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:16,380
(Myeongkyun: I feel more conflicted)

801
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,500
(Myeongkyun: I don't think the atmosphere was good)

802
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:26,540
(Myeongkyun: If I don't talk this time, I don't think I'll ever have a chance to fix this)

803
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,940
(Myeongkyun: I want to talk to him honestly while we can still)

804
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:34,180
(Myeongkyun: meet face to face)

805
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,060
(Youngjoon: Do you have anything else to say?)

806
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,780
(Myeongkyun: I think I've sorted it out in my head now)

807
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:52,980
(Myeongkyun: Actually, I...)

808
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,740
(Myeongkyun: I thought we were dating)

809
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,980
(Youngjoon: Back then?)
(Myeongkyun: Yes, yes)

810
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:04,060
(Myeongkyun: So I thought... we were...)

811
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:09,460
(Myeongkyun: in a stable relationship)

812
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:14,820
(Myeongkyun: Then I suddenly lost contact (with you))

813
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:23,140
(Myeongkyun: So I got very anxious alone)

814
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:27,780
(Youngjoon: Because I didn't reply you?)
(Myeongkyun: Yes)

815
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,340
(Myeongkyun: I told you this a few days ago,)

816
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,700
(Myeongkyun: but once I start to contact someone,)

817
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,540
(Myeongkyun: I will focus only on one person)

818
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,660
(Youngjoon: Then why do you think)

819
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:45,220
(Youngjoon: I cut off contact with you)

820
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,820
(Youngjoon: Back then?)

821
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:51,420
(Myeongkyun: I thought about it a lot)

822
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,580
(Youngjoon: It's like this)

823
00:38:52,580 --> 00:39:00,500
(Youngjoon: I don't hate you enough to block you)

824
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,620
(Youngjoon: It's not like I wanted to erase your existence in my life)

825
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,300
(Youngjoon: I didn't reply to you properly)

826
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,900
(Youngjoon: for over a year)

827
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:14,060
(Youngjoon: So I thought that was enough to express that)

828
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,180
(Youngjoon: I'm no longer interested in you)

829
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,900
(Myeongkyun: (When a relationship's over), people usually)

830
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:28,460
(Myeongkyun: block each other on social media and whatnot)

831
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:35,860
(Myeongkyun: So I kept hanging on to some glimpse of faith)

832
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:41,340
(Youngjoon: It might sound a bit exaggerated,)

833
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:45,860
(Youngjoon: but I'm looking for someone I can spend my life with)

834
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,700
(Youngjoon: If he couldn't be it, I didn't want to...)

835
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:53,340
(Youngjoon: So I wanted to end the relationship naturally)

836
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,660
(Youngjoon: I was sad too)

837
00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:01,260
(Youngjoon: Because you never expressed it, I didn't feel your affections for me)

838
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,460
(Youngjoon: I didn't see that,)

839
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:09,380
(Youngjoon: so I gave up on this relationship first back then)

840
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:18,980
(Myeongkyun: That's a little...)

841
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,780
(I was still hoping for a reconciliation)

842
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:30,260
(Myeongkyun: Since it wasn't ended clearly, (I was still hoping for a reconciliation))

843
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:37,020
(Myeongkyun: I'm not good at saying cheesy stuff)

844
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,660
(Myeongkyun: that lovers do)

845
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,140
(Myeongkyun: I also think I wasn't a good enough lover)

846
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:47,020
(Youngjoon: Yes. It's not that I wanted to hear those stuff)

847
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,460
(Youngjoon: I just felt like our interactions)

848
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:55,020
(Youngjoon: didn't make me feel like we were lovers)

849
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:59,580
(Myeongkyun: But when I was dating you,)

850
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:05,340
(Myeongkyun: I gradually felt that our relationship was progressing)

851
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,780
(Myeongkyun: So I started the relationship like this)

852
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:16,100
(Myeongkyun: and I wanted to maintain it. It takes some time for me)

853
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:21,340
(Myeongkyun: Because it was my first relationship...)

854
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,620
(Myeongkyun: I should've been more expressive)

855
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,860
(Myeongkyun: We didn't really discuss)

856
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,140
(Myeongkyun: about each other's dating style)

857
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:32,260
(Myeongkyun: That was the root of the problem)

858
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:37,420
(Myeongkyun: It was just me that thought things were going well)

859
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,100
(Youngjoon: I'm not sure)

860
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,620
(Youngjoon: what you thought of me then,)

861
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:48,780
(Youngjoon: so I was confused)

862
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,860
(Youngjoon: While meeting you,)

863
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,820
(Youngjoon: I felt there were aspects where we're compatible)

864
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:57,820
(Youngjoon: but also aspects that we weren't)

865
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:03,420
(Youngjoon: Also, with our living routines and habits)

866
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,060
(Youngjoon: You were very busy then)

867
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,260
(Youngjoon: These minor issues accumulated)

868
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:17,820
(Youngjoon: But I didn't think I had to talk everything out)
(Myeongkyun: Right)

869
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:24,660
(Youngjoon: I thought (our relationship) ended naturally)

870
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:30,140
(Youngjoon: But from your point of view, you thought there was still room for reconciliation)

871
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:35,500
(Youngjoon: You might've thought I was still open to reconciliation)

872
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,380
(Youngjoon: From what you just said)

873
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:49,710
(I always... thought of you)

874
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:52,100
-That's why I kept contacting you. -Yeah.
(I always... thought of you)

875
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:52,820
-That's why I kept contacting you. -Yeah.

876
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:58,380
(Myeongkyun: As I've told you, when I saw you again (at Men's House),)

877
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,420
(Myeongkyun: I was surprised but also really glad to see you)

878
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:08,100
(Myeongkyun: I was the one who kept one-sidedly contacting you)

879
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:16,180
(Myeongkyun: If it goes well, we might be able to talk)

880
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,840
(Myeongkyun: We might be able to talk earnestly again)

881
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,020
To ask why you
(Myeongkyun: We might be able to talk earnestly again)

882
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,200
To ask why you

883
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:26,350
gave up on us without saying a thing.

884
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:37,620
(Myeongkyun: But after that, I was a little...)

885
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:40,740
(Myeongkyun: I hoped we could talk about the past first)

886
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:46,740
(Myeongkyun: To tell me why you you cut off contact with me,)

887
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,140
(Myeongkyun: whether you hate me,)

888
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,620
(Myeongkyun: or feel sorry about what happened)

889
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,020
(Myeongkyun: I wanted to talk about that first)

890
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:57,940
(Myeongkyun: We know each other, but we can try to get to know each other again)

891
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:02,900
(Myeongkyun: I hoped you'd say that first)

892
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,540
(Myeongkyun: As soon as you called me over,)

893
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,780
(Myeongkyun: you asked if we should tell everyone that we know each other)

894
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:15,060
(Myeongkyun: That didn't matter to me)

895
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:19,420
(Myeongkyun: I thought it's possible for me to)

896
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,100
(Myeongkyun: fall for you again)

897
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:24,780
(Myeongkyun: But after listening to what you said,)

898
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:30,020
(Myeongkyun: it felt like you wanted to draw the line with me)

899
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:36,100
(Myeongkyun: So from the get-go, I felt very...)

900
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,500
(Youngjoon: Sad and unappreciated?)
(Myeongkyun: Yes)

901
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:45,380
(Myeongkyun: Why didn't you think I could still like you?)

902
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:51,980
(Myeongkyun: I was very hurt but also felt unappreciated)

903
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:57,820
(Myeongkyun: I thought you were cool and lived your life to the fullest)

904
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,140
(Myeongkyun: when I was dating you)

905
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:04,460
(Myeongkyun: I could learn a lot from you)

906
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:08,220
(Myeongkyun: You also have a good personality)

907
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,460
(Myeongkyun: So I kept wanting)

908
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:15,340
(Myeongkyun: to maintain and develop our relationship)

909
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:20,100
(Myeongkyun: But from the get-go, you...)

910
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,380
(Myeongkyun: didn't even consider this possibility)

911
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,560
So you were shocked.

912
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,590
Yes.

913
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:32,900
(Youngjoon: First of all, I'm most surprised that he hopes I can apologize)

914
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:38,220
(Youngjoon: for the way I ended things)

915
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,700
(Youngjoon: That never crossed my mind)

916
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:44,020
(Youngjoon: From Myeongkyun's point of view, he must feel sad and unappreciated)

917
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:47,620
(Youngjoon: I made him feel this way)

918
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:54,340
(Youngjoon: From the moment you came in,)

919
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:58,940
(Youngjoon: I thought you came on the show to make a name for yourself as an actor,)

920
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:01,620
(Youngjoon: rather than to look for love)

921
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,380
(Youngjoon: I thought of it very negatively)

922
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,460
(Youngjoon: Because I thought of you)

923
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:10,260
(Youngjoon: as someone who doesn't want a proper relationship)

924
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:15,420
(Youngjoon: For the memories of us that you remember...)

925
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,820
(I've actually forgotten a lot of it)

926
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:23,380
(Youngjoon: It didn't cross my mind that)

927
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:27,620
(Youngjoon: you'd even think this way)

928
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,340
(Youngjoon: On the first call session,)

929
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:37,820
(Youngjoon: if you still have feelings for me,)

930
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:41,660
(Youngjoon: since you haven't gotten to know the others,)

931
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:45,140
(Youngjoon: I thought you might call me)

932
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:49,660
(Youngjoon: But you didn't call me, so...)

933
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,660
(Youngjoon: I thought it wasn't possible)

934
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:56,220
(Youngjoon: and that I shouldn't overthink things)

935
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,700
(Youngjoon: That's what I thought)

936
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:02,940
(Youngjoon: Now I also feel like maybe things might be different)

937
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,380
(Youngjoon: if you brought things up with me first)

938
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:11,020
(Youngjoon: I didn't say what you wanted to hear,)

939
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:14,060
(Youngjoon: so you were also upset)

940
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:18,460
(Youngjoon: I don't hate that you liked me)

941
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,100
(Youngjoon: But you've never expressed your affections to me)

942
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,430
That means you don't like me.

943
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:31,320
So I was confused as to why you kept

944
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:32,900
provoking me.

945
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:39,420
(Myeongkyun: I really thought for a long time before making the call)

946
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:47,340
(Myeongkyun: But you just called me over and drew the line with me)

947
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:51,220
(Myeongkyun: So I thought if I tried to...)

948
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:58,700
(Myeongkyun: If I give up my pride and make the call to you,)

949
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,380
(Myeongkyun: it'd really be...)

950
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:05,620
(Myeongkyun: Yeah. I wasn't brave enough. I was very scared)

951
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,860
(Myeongkyun: I got hurt a lot)

952
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:15,180
(Myeongkyun: So rather than clinging onto you, I just made a new attempt)

953
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:22,620
(Youngjoon: I sort of caught on to it when he said it's his weakness yesterday)

954
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:26,620
(Youngjoon: That he wass more sincere about our relationship)

955
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:32,780
(Youngjoon: than he thought)

956
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:40,540
(Youngjoon: Yesterday, I swore and yell at you in the heat of the moment)

957
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:45,220
(Youngjoon: I made everyone walk on eggshells around me)

958
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:48,220
(Youngjoon: I'm really sorry to you and the others too)

959
00:48:54,260 --> 00:49:00,460
(Youngjoon: Actually, I was having a tough time yesterday)

960
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:07,180
(Youngjoon: The fact that others have to be wary about)

961
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:10,580
(Youngjoon: what happened between us in the past)

962
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:14,380
(Youngjoon: is stressful for me)

963
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:15,660
(Youngjoon: I couldn't deal with it alone)

964
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:20,620
(Youngjoon: But no matter how I talked to you, no progress was made)

965
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:24,220
(Youngjoon: I was at a loss)

966
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:32,020
(Youngjoon: Then I got the anonymous question from you)

967
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:35,380
(Youngjoon: What exactly does that mean?)

968
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,380
(Youngjoon: It sounded so cryptic,)

969
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:41,780
(Youngjoon: like there's something behind it)

970
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,220
(Youngjoon: So I felt wronged)

971
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,740
(Youngjoon: Even until now, I want to ask you)

972
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:51,180
(Youngjoon: whatmade you feel that way)

973
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,100
(Youngjoon: I still have no clue)

974
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:58,940
(Youngjoon: Were you overreacting because you were angry with me?)

975
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:04,220
(Youngjoon: Or is it some metaphor?)

976
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:06,740
(Youngjoon: I really don't understand it)

977
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:11,620
(Myeongkyun: The you that I know...)
(Youngjoon: Isn't how I'm acting now?)

978
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:16,140
(Myeongkyun: That...)
(Youngjoon: That feels like the real me?)

979
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:21,700
(Myeongkyun: From what I've seen,)

980
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,420
(Myeongkyun: you are...)
(Youngjoon: Very aggressive?)

981
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:31,020
(Myeongkyun: you aren't acting out of your interest towards someone,)

982
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:35,980
(Myeongkyun: but considering a lot of other factors)

983
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:41,620
(Myeongkyun: (Youngjoon's) actually very calm)

984
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:48,940
(Myeongkyun: He's not the type to act so loud and try to hype things up)

985
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:54,740
(Myeongkyun: It felt strongly like he was putting up an act)

986
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:58,740
(Myeongkyun: so that he'll be perceived in a certain way)

987
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:01,020
(Youngjoon: When spending time with others)

988
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:03,780
(Youngjoon: as friends,)

989
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:08,060
(Youngjoon: the me who's talkative, directing the cooking,)

990
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,900
(Youngjoon: and hyping things up is also my true self)

991
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,900
(Youngjoon: I've never shown that side to you)

992
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,740
(Youngjoon: Back then, it's also because)

993
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,340
(Youngjoon: I wanted to impress you)

994
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,260
(Youngjoon: as a romantic)

995
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,540
(Youngjoon: partner)

996
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,700
(Myeongkyun: But I think you're more natural now)

997
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:28,020
(Myeongkyun: When we were dating, it felt like this)

998
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:31,660
(Myeongkyun: It was a bit more relaxed than now though)

999
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:35,260
(Youngjoon: Myeongkyun's expression now is unusual too)

1000
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,300
(Youngjoon: But from Myeongkyun's point of view,)

1001
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:40,740
(Youngjoon: I could've seemed too different)

1002
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:45,460
(Youngjoon: You can consider that maybe the me you saw back then)

1003
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:48,900
(Youngjoon: is not my true self)

1004
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,540
(Youngjoon: Because I wanted to please you back then)

1005
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,740
(Youngjoon: I wanted to show you a good side of me)

1006
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:58,260
(Youngjoon: So you need to understand that)

1007
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:01,740
(Myeongkyun: Okay)
(Youngjoon: Yes)

1008
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:08,820
(Myeongkyun calmly organizes his thoughts)

1009
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,620
(Myeongkyun: Okay. I'm sorry)
(Youngjoon: What?)

1010
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:19,500
(I'm sorry)

1011
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:23,300
(Youngjoon: Now that I think about it, I should be thankful)

1012
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,780
(Youngjoon: He was sincerely interested in me)

1013
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:31,340
(Youngjoon: and expressed it to me)

1014
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:37,380
(Youngjoon: Apart from feeling upset because of me, are you still)

1015
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:40,540
(Youngjoon: interested in me?)

1016
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:46,180
(Myeongkyun: Not anymore)
(Youngjoon: Not anymore?)

1017
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,700
(Youngjoon: I saw that his gaze was shaky)

1018
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,500
(Youngjoon: and nervous)

1019
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:01,380
(Youngjoon: His voice was also shaky)

1020
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,380
(Youngjoon: It felt like he said)

1021
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:07,500
(Youngjoon: he wasn't interested in me anymore because he knows how I feel for him now)

1022
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:11,660
(Youngjoon: and he will stop liking me)

1023
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,020
(Myeongkyun: I just feel a little empty)

1024
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:21,500
(Myeongkyun: It was just me that was troubled by it for a long time)

1025
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,940
(Myeongkyun: I felt empty)

1026
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,660
(Youngjoon: Then...)

1027
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,780
(Youngjoon: You don't like me anymore)

1028
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:38,940
(Youngjoon: I've made myself clear too, that I don't have any feelings for you)

1029
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:45,620
(Youngjoon: So let's focus our remaining time)

1030
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:50,780
(Youngjoon: on what we each want to do)

1031
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:55,500
(Youngjoon: Amicably...)

1032
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:00,500
(Youngjoon: You'll live your life, and I'll live mine)

1033
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:11,940
(Youngjoon: Be true to our feelings. Let's get along well until we leave this place)

1034
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:21,580
(Youngjoon: Let's get along amicably and say goodbye)
(Myeongkyun: Okay)

1035
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,620
(Youngjoon: I wanted to say to get along well in the future,)

1036
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:29,420
(Youngjoon: but it might cause a misunderstanding)

1037
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:31,940
(Youngjoon: So I rephrased it)

1038
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:35,700
(Myeongkyun: I think I can be good friends with him)

1039
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:38,060
(It depends on what Youngjoon thinks though)

1040
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:43,540
(Youngjoon: We were so different, with different ideas)

1041
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:46,580
(Youngjoon: We were so clueless...)

1042
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:50,780
(Youngjoon: Let's get along with ease like friends as before)

1043
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:54,300
(Youngjoon: Let's just say it's our mission)
(Myeongkyun: Okay)

1044
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,060
(Youngjoon: Our homework)

1045
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,660
(Myeongkyun: Oh, and...)

1046
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:04,660
(Myeongkyun: I really didn't shower first on purpose on the third day)

1047
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,660
(Youngjoon: I'll never forget it)
(Myeongkyun: I really didn't do it on purpose)

1048
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,260
(Youngjoon: I really won't forget that)

1049
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:11,500
(Myeongkyun: I was dazed and made the best choice I could)

1050
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,660
(Youngjoon: No, you did it on purpose)
(Myeongkyun: No, I didn't)

1051
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:17,260
(Youngjoon: It's already a problem that you set an alarm at 7:30 a.m.)
(Myeongkyun: I...)

1052
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,380
(Youngjoon: You told me 8 a.m.)

1053
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,940
(Youngjoon: But why did two alarms ring at 7:30?)

1054
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:27,020
(Myeongkyun: I set two at 7:30 and one at 8)
(Youngjoon: That's what I'm saying. Why did you set them like that?)

1055
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,500
-Just in case... -That was the root of the problem.

1056
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,230
(They seem more relaxed after letting out their suppressed feelings)
-Just in case... -That was the root of the problem.

1057
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:29,430
(They seem more relaxed after letting out their suppressed feelings)

1058
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:32,010
-I forgot I set them before. I just added an extra alarm.
(They seem more relaxed after letting out their suppressed feelings)

1059
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:33,950
-I added two new alarms. -Exactly.
(They seem more relaxed after letting out their suppressed feelings)

1060
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:34,110
(They seem more relaxed after letting out their suppressed feelings)

1061
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:36,030
-Seriously. -Sorry.
(They seem more relaxed after letting out their suppressed feelings)

1062
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,540
(Myeongkyun: I'm sorry. I didn't mean it)

1063
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,340
(Youngjoon: It's okay. Everyone said it was funny)

1064
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,720
(Youngjoon: That we're like Tom and Jerry)

1065
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,820
Okay.
(Youngjoon: That we're like Tom and Jerry)

1066
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:47,140
(Youngjoon: During all my past conversations with Myeongkyun,)

1067
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:52,780
(Youngjoon: he'd never responded to my questions properly)

1068
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:58,900
(Youngjoon: Today, he bravely expressed his true feelings first)

1069
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:02,940
(Youngjoon: It's more relieving and relaxing than I thought)

1070
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:06,020
(Myeongkyun: I'm glad that that we'd at least)

1071
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:10,340
(Myeongkyun: no longer be awkward with each other anymore)

1072
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:12,620
-I think they're back. -Hello.

1073
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:13,410
(Youngjoon and Myeongkyun return home after the conversation)
-I think they're back. -Hello.

1074
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:13,550
(Youngjoon and Myeongkyun return home after the conversation)

1075
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:14,440
You're home.
(Youngjoon and Myeongkyun return home after the conversation)

1076
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:14,470
(Youngjoon and Myeongkyun return home after the conversation)

1077
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:15,360
We cooked...
(Youngjoon and Myeongkyun return home after the conversation)

1078
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:16,060
We already had dinner.

1079
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:16,140
(The men welcome Youngjoon and Myeongkyun warmly)
We already had dinner.

1080
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:16,290
(The men welcome Youngjoon and Myeongkyun warmly)

1081
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:17,410
-We just ate. -Did you eat?
(The men welcome Youngjoon and Myeongkyun warmly)

1082
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:18,440
I was wondering if we should clean up.
(The men welcome Youngjoon and Myeongkyun warmly)

1083
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,570
What are the dishes?
(The men welcome Youngjoon and Myeongkyun warmly)

1084
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:23,580
(Minseon: It's quite different from what I saw this morning)

1085
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:28,780
(Minseon: As long as they get along like this, it won't be awkward)

1086
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:30,140
-Spicy pork and fishcakes. -Fishcakes.

1087
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:30,940
Both dishes are delicious.

1088
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:31,220
-Hello -You can eat now.

1089
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,810
(Welcome)
(Seongmin: You can eat now)
-Hello -You can eat now.

1090
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:34,300
(Welcome)
(Seongmin: You can eat now)

1091
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,550
(Youngjoon: Did you have fun?)

1092
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:36,820
I worked hard.
(Youngjoon: Did you have fun?)

1093
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:37,810
I worked hard.

1094
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:41,020
(Seongmin: Did I have fun? I had fun on the date)

1095
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,940
(Youngjoon: What did you do?)
(Seongmin: We went to an exhibition)

1096
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:46,060
(Hanmin: It was like work)
(Seongmin: Work?)

1097
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:52,300
(Hanmin: He was more cheerful. I think their talk went well)

1098
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,380
We’ve been photographers all day.

1099
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:56,140
(Hanmin shows Youngjoon photos of his date)
We’ve been photographers all day.

00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:00,180
(Youngjoon: It's an interesting exhibition)

1102
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,940
(Youngjoon: It's Go-Stop cards)
(Hanmin: Go-Stop cards)

1103
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,940
(Hanmin: It's actually very big)

1104
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:05,340
(Myeongkyun: Thank you for the food)

1105
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:08,160
(Myeongkyun: It looks delicious. Have you all eaten?)
(Minseon: Yes, you can get some rice from here)

1106
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:08,220
Do you mind eating this bowl? It was untouched.
(Myeongkyun: It looks delicious. Have you all eaten?)

Thank you.

(Minseon: Yeah. Thigh meat)

1112
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,060
(Myeongkyun: Thigh meat? Oh)

1113
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:21,740
(Minseon: I made most of the spicy pork)
(Myeongkyun: Really? Thank you)

1114
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:22,730
Hwi and I...
(Minseon: I made most of the spicy pork)
(Myeongkyun: Really? Thank you)

1115
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:25,100
(Youngjoon: There were no chilis, so you added peperoncino?)

1116
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,980
(Myeongkyun: Didn't you say you'll make pork cutlets tomorrow?)
(Minseon: Tomorrow)

1117
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,500
(Minseon: Today is Hwi's dish)

1118
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,380
(Minseon: I helped a lot. 80% to 90% was my work)

1119
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:37,980
(Youngjoon: We made up and decided to be besties)
(Minseon: That's a relief)

1120
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:39,100
(Myeongkyun: Try it!)

1121
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,900
(Myeongkyun: I made this)
(Youngjoon: I don't want to eat it)

1122
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,460
(Why?)
(Because you made it!)

1123
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:45,700
(Myeongkyun: It's delicious)

1124
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,020
(Youngjoon: I'll maintain this vibe) (Haha)

1125
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:50,220
(Minseon: That's good)

1126
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:55,500
(Youngjoon: The people most influenced by my relationship with Myeongkyun)

1127
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,900
(Youngjoon: are Hanmin and Minseon)

1128
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,340
(Youngjoon: That's why I said it's settled)

1129
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:04,580
(Youngjoon: and we'll get along well without issues)

1130
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:08,180
(Youngjoon: to relieve the tension)

1131
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:14,420
(Myeongkyun: After the honest talk, we're almost back to our old selves)

1132
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:18,420
(Minseon: In my opinion, it was settled because one side made concessions)

1133
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:21,220
(Minseon: I'm afraid the other hasn't let it go yet)

1134
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:23,420
(Minseon: He said it was settled,)

1135
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:26,900
(Minseon: but to be honest, I don't believe it)

1136
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:28,680
(Unlike the two who are relieved, Minseon still has a lingering fear)

1137
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,710
It's my first time eating spicy fishcakes.
(Unlike the two who are relieved, Minseon still has a lingering fear)

1138
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:31,750
-Really? -Not bad, right?
(Unlike the two who are relieved, Minseon still has a lingering fear)

1139
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:33,020
-Yeah -Delicious.
(Unlike the two who are relieved, Minseon still has a lingering fear)

1140
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:34,140
(Unlike the two who are relieved, Minseon still has a lingering fear)

1141
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:35,690
(Hwi: Let’s go to the third floor)

1142
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:37,120
-What -3rd floor.
(Hwi: Let’s go to the third floor)

1143
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:38,460
I was about to eat.

1144
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:38,870
(Passing Seongmin and Jaeseung in the living room, Hwi goes to the third floor immediately)
I was about to eat.

1145
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:41,620
(Passing Seongmin and Jaeseung in the living room, Hwi goes to the third floor immediately)

1146
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:47,540
(Falling down)

1147
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,540
(Oh...)

1148
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,430
(Didn't we agree to take a photo?)

1149
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:51,420
We agreed to take photos.
(Didn't we agree to take a photo?)

1150
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:51,460
(Ah, yes)

1151
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,520
That's right.
(Ah, yes)

1152
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:53,860
(Wow, so beautiful)

1153
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:54,540
(Click)

1154
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:54,710
(Click)

1155
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:55,420
So beautiful.

(Click)
So beautiful.

1158
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:56,980
So beautiful.

1159
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:57,750
(Good. It was natural)
So beautiful.

1160
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:59,900
(Good. It was natural)

1161
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:03,740
(Wow, you're so pretty and charming)

1162
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:04,580
(It hurts)

1163
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:05,500
(Seungjin: Are you going to stay here?)

1164
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,620
(Hwi: Shall we have some relaxation time?)
(Seungjin: Okay)

1165
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:09,170
(Hwi & Seungjin's relaxation time = Lying down)

1166
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,690
ASMR.
(Hwi & Seungjin's relaxation time = Lying down)

1167
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:14,620
(Hwi: After dinner,)

1168
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:17,140
(Hwi: a little bit later...)

1169
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:22,620
(I told Seongmin I wanted to talk to him)
(Seongmin?)

1170
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,020
(To talk to him)
(Why?)

1171
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,220
(No reason...)

1172
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,660
(And then?)

1173
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:29,700
(What are you going to say)

1174
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,070
(Hwi: I’ve already told him)

1175
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:32,210
What?
(Hwi: I’ve already told him)

1176
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,460
(Seungjin: He never backs down)

1177
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:38,580
(Hwi: What should I do?)
(Seungjin: What do you mean?)

1178
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,180
(Seungjin: Tell him you love him)

1179
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:45,060
(I think I'm in love with you)

1180
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:47,050
I'm so pissed off.

1181
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:49,140
(I'm so bloody pissed off)

1182
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:51,620
(I'm so bloody pissed off)

1183
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,980
(Hwi: I won’t eat croffles anymore)

1184
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:59,300
(Sigh..) (Hahahaha)

1185
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:01,860
(Hello X2)
(Yeah?)

1186
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,780
(Hello X2)
(Yeah X2)

1187
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:05,660
(Yeah X2)

1188
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:06,010
(Go ahead)

1189
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:07,100
-Go ahead. -Yeah.
(Go ahead)

1190

(Hehehehe)
(Go ahead X2)
-Go ahead. -Yeah.
(Go ahead)

1191
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:12,100
(Hehehehe)
(Go ahead X2)

1192
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:15,380
(Hwi: Should we brush our teeth?)
(Seungjin: Okay)

1193
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:19,540
(Hwi: Let's go brush our teeth)
(Seungjin: Okay)

1194
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,780
(A glance)

1195
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:22,960
(Jaeseung & Seongmin still chatting in the living room)
(Notices Hwi)

1196
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,440
-I'm just worried. -Worried?
(Jaeseung & Seongmin still chatting in the living room)
(Notices Hwi)

1197
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,820
(Jaeseung & Seongmin still chatting in the living room)
(Notices Hwi)

1198
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:28,660
(Jaeseung & Seongmin still chatting in the living room)
(Wary)

1199
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:30,740
(Sigh)

1200
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:34,180
(Stopping)

1201
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,860
(Hwi is eavesdropping on Jaeseung and Seongmin's conversation)

1202
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:43,380
(Jaeseung: Your birthday is coming)
(Seongmin: Right. July...)

1203
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:48,140
(Jaeseung: I hope I'll be the first)

1204
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:50,940
(Jaeseung: to wish you a happy birthday)

1205
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,420
(Shy)

1206
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:58,380
(Seongmin: I'll accept it with gratitude)

1207
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:02,380
(Gosh)

1208
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,820
(Wary)

1209
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:10,860
(Hwi doesn't move)

1210
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,940
(What's wrong?)
(Shhh)

1211
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,380
(What is it?)

1212
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:22,540
Isn't it funny?

1213
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:27,980
(Seongmin: I thought Hanmin was my rival)
(Jaeseung: Right)

1214
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:29,980
(Seongmin: When I went to your room after the anonymous chat,)

1215
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:33,100
(Seongmin: you were with Hanmin)

1216
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:34,460
(Seongmin: I wondered what was going in)

1217
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:36,900
(Seongmin: When I was in the room with Hanmin,)

1218
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:41,260
(Seongmin: I saw Hanmin enter your chat group, so I...)

1219
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:47,500
(Jaeseung: Hanmin was just observing)
(Seongmin: Observing?)

1220
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:52,620
(Seongmin: I feel comfortable with Hanmin. He's like a younger brother)

1221
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:53,240
(What is Hwi thinking?)

1222
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,300
Two years younger?
(What is Hwi thinking?)

1223
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:54,490
(What is Hwi thinking?)

1224
01:01:54,490 --> 01:01:56,490
Yes, he's two years younger than me.
(What is Hwi thinking?)

1225
01:01:56,490 --> 01:01:58,920
(What is Hwi thinking?)

1226
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,620
So he's like a comfortable younger brother.
(What is Hwi thinking?)

1227
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:01,830
So he's like a comfortable younger brother.

1228
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:02,580
-What are they talking about? -I'm so pissed off.

1229
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:03,940
(Second-level anger)
-What are they talking about? -I'm so pissed off.

1230
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:05,900
(Seungjin: What are they talking about?)

1231
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:09,280
Do you have that? The toothbrush...

1232
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:13,260
(Brushing teeth in anger)

1233
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:16,900
(Hwi: Jaeseung... I won't let you off)

1234
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,620
(Hwi: I'll teach you a lesson)

1235
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:22,180
(Hwi: What is he doing to me, who's 10 years younger than him?)

1236
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:25,500
(Hwi: Doesn't he feel guilty at all?)

1237
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:30,140
(Hwi: To be honest, Daejeon and the capital is too far apart)

1238
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:34,820
(Hwi: I don't think they'll work out)

1239
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:41,980
(A glance)

1240
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,620
(Jaeseung & Seongmin are no longer in the living room)

1241
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:54,020
(Hwi puts the toothbrush back and rushes down to check out the first floor)

1242
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:58,780
(You can see the balcony from this window)

1243
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:01,580
(Hwi: Seongmin & Jaeseung)

1244
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:03,980
(Hwi: were talking at the second-floor balcony)

1245
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:08,380
(Hwi: I was so angry that I wanted to lock the door)

1246
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:10,500
(Hwi: Make them unable to get out)

1247
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,540
(Hwi: Then they'll fight)

1248
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:19,210
(Seungjin: Were (Jaeseung & Seongmin) talking about Hanmin?)
(Hwi: Who? No)

1249
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:20,260
Who? No.
(Seungjin: Were (Jaeseung & Seongmin) talking about Hanmin?)
(Hwi: Who? No)

1250
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:20,390
(Hwi: They are...)
(Seungjin: Are they talking about something serious?)
Who? No.
(Seungjin: Were (Jaeseung & Seongmin) talking about Hanmin?)
(Hwi: Who? No)

1251
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:24,820
(Hwi: They are...)
(Seungjin: Are they talking about something serious?)

1252
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:28,940
(Hwi: (Jaeseung & Seongmin) went to the second-floor balcony)

1253
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,000
(Serious)

1254
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,100
Really?
(Serious)

1255
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,860
(Serious)

1256
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:43,500
(Seungjin: Are you suddenly troubled?)
(Hwi: What?)

1257
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,380
(Seungjin: Are you suddenly troubled?)

1258
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:48,420
(So XX annoying)

1259
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,590
What? So XX annoying?

1260
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:58,660
So XX annoying.

1261
01:03:58,660 --> 01:03:58,700
(What? So XX annoying?)
So XX annoying.

1262
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:00,860
(What? So XX annoying?)

1263
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:03,700
(Hwi: No, it's really annoying…)

1264
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:06,100
(Hwi: I really want it)

1265
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,500
(Hwi: So nothing's off limits)

1266
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:14,220
(Hwi: So I came up with a few strategies)

1267
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:16,300
(Hwi: to win Seongmin back)

1268
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:21,220
(Hwi: The first thing I thought of was the "seduction strategy")

1269
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:24,620
(Hwi: I'll do the opposite. I'll seduce Jaeseung)

1270
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:27,820
(Hwi: Get along well until the last day.)

1271
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:29,700
(Hwi: Then I'll choose Seongmin)

1272
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:33,540
(Hwi: I came up with this thrilling script)

1273
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:36,380
(Hwi: (My next strategy) is an extension of the seduction strategy)

1274
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:39,820
(Hwi: When Jaeseung's asleep, I'll place a plate of croffles by his bed)

1275
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:41,420
(Hwi: I'll make him some croffles)

1276
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:44,140
(Hwi: When he sees it, he'll be curious who made it)

1277
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:45,580
(Hwi: I'll admit that I did it)

1278
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:48,780
(Hwi: Then he might be interested in me and ask me to follow him)

1279
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:50,340
(Hwi: Seduce him in this way)

1280
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:54,420
(“I’m good at making croffles”)

1281
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:58,180
(It feels good just thinking about it)

1282
01:04:58,380 --> 01:04:59,930
(Myeongkyun: Where did you go? Museum?)
(Hanmin: An exhibition)

1283
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:00,730
-An exhibition. -An exhibition.
(Myeongkyun: Where did you go? Museum?)
(Hanmin: An exhibition)

1284
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:01,460
An exhibition.
(Myeongkyun: Where did you go? Museum?)
(Hanmin: An exhibition)

1285
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:03,940
(Minseon: They went to an exhibition, a pottery workshop, and an amusement park)

1286
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:06,300
(Youngjoon: Pottery workshop)

1287
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:10,500
(Minseon: Today's a peaceful day)
(Myeongkyun: That's right)

1288
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:14,540
(Youngjoon: You two must feel better since you napped)
(Myeongkyun: Yes? For about one and a half hours?)

1289
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,740
(Minseon: We slept for an hour and a half, but what's shocking is...)

1290
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:21,820
(Youngjoon: They slept the least)
(Hanmin: Right. We talked about it)

1291
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:23,940
(Minseon: What's that?)

1292
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:24,460
(Why are the men shocked?)

1293
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:26,060
-What's that? -What's that?
(Why are the men shocked?)

1294
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:27,270
(Why are the men shocked?)

1295
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:27,940
-What's that? -What's that?
(Why are the men shocked?)

1296
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:28,100
-What's that? -What's that?

1297
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:28,610
(Getting up)
-What's that? -What's that?

1298
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:29,700
(Getting up)

1299
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,860
(Youngjoon: Please express your feelings to the person you're thinking of through a letter)

1300
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:37,500
(Guys!)

1301
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:44,700
(Please express your feelings to the person you're thinking of through a letter)
(Tiem for the men to express their feelings through letters)

1302
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:46,020
(Guys!)

1303
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:49,140
(Myeongkyun: We were just talking here. Why didn't anyone notice?)
(Youngjoon: I know, right?)

1304
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:50,220
(Youngjoon: How did you find out?)

1305
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:55,380
(Minseon: While we were talking, I saw something that shouldn't be here)

1306
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:58,420
(Youngjoon: But it's not urgent)
(Minseon: It's letter writing)

1307
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:02,060
(Youngjoon: Guys, let's write letters)
(Minseon: Event)

1308
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:07,740
(Seungjin: Please express your feelings to the person you're thinking of through a letter)

1309
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:09,060
(Jaeseung: Is it another card again?)

1310
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:11,700
(Jaeseung & Seongmin come out after hearing noise)

1311
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:15,540
(Youngjoon: Letter writing)

1312
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:18,580
(Seungjin: I'm going upstairs to write~)

1313
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:22,420
(Minseon: I'm really bad at this)
(Hanmin: Me too)

1314
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:26,060
Write to the person you're thinking of now.

1315
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:28,260
We did it yesterday. Why all of a sudden?

1316
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:30,290
(Jaeseung & Seongmin are the last to check the mission card)

1317
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:33,400
Please express your feelings to the person you're thinking of through a letter.
(Jaeseung & Seongmin are the last to check the mission card)

1318
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,020
The person you're thinking of now.
(Jaeseung & Seongmin are the last to check the mission card)

1319
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:35,330
The person you're thinking of now.

1320
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:39,660
(Seongmin: Express your feelings through a letter)

1321
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:43,140
(Jaeseung: Where should I write it?)

1322
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:47,100
(Jaeseung: I have my own room anyway. Fighting)

1323
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:51,340
(Jaeseung: Wait. Isn't this only for one person?)
(Minseon: One for each person)

1324
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:52,670
Yes.

1325
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:55,950
(Minseon: After writing this letter, shall we gather to clean up the (dining table) together?)
(Youngjoon: Okay)

1326
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:56,630
Okay.
(Minseon: After writing this letter, shall we gather to clean up the (dining table) together?)
(Youngjoon: Okay)

1327
01:06:56,630 --> 01:06:56,740
(Minseon: After writing this letter, shall we gather to clean up the (dining table) together?)
(Youngjoon: Okay)

1328
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:57,600
Okay.
(Minseon: After writing this letter, shall we gather to clean up the (dining table) together?)
(Youngjoon: Okay)

1329
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,780
(Minseon: After writing this letter, shall we gather to clean up the (dining table) together?)
(Youngjoon: Okay)

1330
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:01,660
(Youngjoon: It's easier to write on the dining table)

1331
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:06,020
(Seungjin: Sigh... I'd rather make phone calls)

1332
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:10,620
(Hwi: Instead of who to write to,)

1333
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:13,860
(Hwi: I was thinking of what I should write)

1334
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:16,660
(Myeongkyun: I think I prefer writing letters)

1335
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:19,980
(Myeongkyun: Because I have time to think about it)

1336
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:22,740
(Minseon: When I saw the mission, I knew who I'd write to)

1337
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:28,260
(Seongmin: Should I wrote an apology letter or a love letter?)

1338
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:32,540
(What kind of letters will the men write?)

1339
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:37,220
(Hesitant)

1340
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:41,260
(Struggling from the first sentence)

1341
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:47,020
(Thinking)

1342
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:49,780
(Hanmin: What should I write?)

1343
01:07:55,700 --> 01:08:00,140
(Myeongkyun: I really can't say cheesy words)

1344
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:04,260
(Myeongkyun: but I wrote a lot of things I wanted to say)

1345
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:08,380
(Youngjoon: It's hard to start)

1346
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:11,580
(Youngjoon: But once I start writing, I can write non-stop,)

1347
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:13,420
(Youngjoon: filling two to three A4 papers)

1348
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:15,860
(Youngjoon: Because I have a lot to say)

1349
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:19,140
(Youngjoon: I think I can organize my feelings before expressing it)

1350
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:22,220
(Youngjoon: So I prefer letters)

1351
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:29,779
(Hanmin: I've never written a love letter before)

1352
01:08:29,779 --> 01:08:32,260
(Hanmin: I just wrote it...)

1353
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:34,180
(Hanmin: Did I do it correctly?)

1354
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:42,819
(Hanmin: I hope at least he'd like it when he sees it)

1355
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:48,340
(Men carefully selecting their words and conveying their true feelings)

1356
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:54,020
(Hwi and Seungjin write letters side by side on the third floor)

1357
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:05,859
(Seungjin: Well... has it been seven years?)

1358
01:09:05,859 --> 01:09:08,819
(Seungjin: I don't think I've written a letter except during my school days)

1359
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:15,540
(Serious)

1360
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:31,100
(Seungjin: Today's promise to only be happy became a lie)

1361
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:36,100
(Choked up) (No, no, no)

1362
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:37,180
(Choked up) (No, no, no)

1363
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:37,899
-No, no, no. -Okay, okay.

1364
01:09:37,899 --> 01:09:38,410
(Hwi is trying to suppress his tears)
-No, no, no. -Okay, okay.

1365
01:09:38,410 --> 01:09:38,540
(Hwi is trying to suppress his tears)

1366
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:39,310
No, no, no.
(Hwi is trying to suppress his tears)

1367
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:41,220
(Hwi is trying to suppress his tears)

1368
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:45,340
(♫I don't mean anything else; I'm really sorry♫)

1369
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:47,180
(Seungjin: Everyone must feel the same)

1370
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:50,140
(Seungjin: I'll sing for you)

1371
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:54,900
(Looking)

1372
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:58,020
(Seungjin: Wow, so many words...)

1373
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:05,140
(Hwi: I thought a lot)

1374
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:07,180
(Hwi: I wrote it for a long time)

1375
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:11,660
(Hwi: That's why I filled up the card)

1376
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:18,820
(Who is Seongmin thinking of? What's he writing about?)

1377
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:31,420
(Seongmin: I think what you write with sincerity is a letter)

1378
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:33,620
(Seongmin: So I think it's an opportunity for some people)

1379
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:40,060
(Seongmin: while a sad thing for others)

1380
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:46,100
(After writing their sincere letters)

1381
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,740
(Choked up)

1382
01:10:55,260 --> 01:11:00,220
(Patting and comforting)

1383
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,380
(Hwi: Crying every day)

1384
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:22,540
(Seungjin: So what if you cry every day? Just cry)

1385
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:33,060
(Hwi: Pretend to massage my back)
(Seungjin: Does it hurt here?)

1386
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:34,760
(Seungjin: Oh, you mean it hurts here?)

1387
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:35,440
Yes, there.
(Seungjin: Oh, you mean it hurts here?)

1388
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:41,180
(Seungjin: I think he's really being true to his feelings)

1389
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:45,060
(Seungjin: Why don't he try to be less obsessed with Seongmin?)

1390
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:52,940
(Minseon: Why are you giving him a shoulder massage?)
(Seungjin: He's aching)

1391
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:54,280
(Minseon: Should I get some medicated plasters?)
(Hwi: It's okay)

1392
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,220
-No. -No.
(Minseon: Should I get some medicated plasters?)
(Hwi: It's okay)

1393
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:55,780
(Minseon: Should I get some medicated plasters?)
(Hwi: It's okay)

1394
01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:57,250
A massage will do.

1395
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:05,020
(Hwi: Something went into my eyes)

1396
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:10,020
(Comfy? Comfy)

1397
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:14,460
(Comfy?)

1398
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:15,360
(It's okay) (Sad)

1399
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,740
-Can I chain-smoke? -Yes.
(It's okay) (Sad)

1400
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:18,090
(It's okay) (Sad)

1401
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:19,850
Smoke five if you need.
(It's okay) (Sad)

1402
01:12:19,850 --> 01:12:20,900
(It's okay) (Sad)

1403
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:28,060
(Hwi: It's absurd. Maybe I have too much water in my body. I'm sweating from my eyes)

1404
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:34,020
(Minseon and Seungjin stay by Hwi's side silently)

1405
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:40,390
(Hwi: Should I not have come here?)
(No) (No)

1406
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:41,490
Not at all.
(Hwi: Should I not have come here?)
(No) (No)

1407
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:45,420
(Hwi: I think I'm really clueless)
(Seungjin: Not true)

1408
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:47,060
(Seungjin: Why are you doing this?)
(Minseon: Please don't blame yourself)

1409
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:51,060
(Minseon: Why do you keep belittling yourself? Don't do this)

1410
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:58,340
(It's time to send their heartfelt letters)

1411
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:05,540
(What confessions do the men make through the letters?)

1412
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:20,220
(Jaeseung: There were two letter boxes)

1413
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:22,900
(Jaeseung: I think it must mean something)

1414
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:49,700
(Hanmin: Oh? Why? Is it divided into two (letter boxes) because there are many people?)

1415
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:06,460
(Minseon: There must be something hidden behind it)

1416
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:12,660
(Minseon: One of the letter boxes may not send out the letters)

1417
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:15,220
(Minseon: This was the first thing I thought of)

1418
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:17,700
(Minseon: That's really shocking)

1419
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:22,860
(Hwi: I'm conflicted again)

1420
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:26,620
(Hwi: Right or left? Which letter box should I put it in?)

1421
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:41,940
(Seungjin puts his letter in directly)

1422
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:58,620
(Myeongkyun carefully observes the letter boxes)

1423
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:06,620
(Ding-dong-daeng)

1424
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:08,300
(The rainbow is out)

1425
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:10,860
(Peter Pan)

1426
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:12,580
(Coca Cola)

1427
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:19,620
(Myeongkyun: What is it?)

1428
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:26,780
(Youngjoon: What is it? Do I get to choose?)

1429
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:37,180
(Youngjoon: Why are there two?)

1430
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:47,740
(Seongmin: Why are there two?)

1431
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:48,820
(Seongmin: What's going on?)

1432
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:57,020
(Seongmin: What is it? What's going on?)

1433
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:11,060
(Seongmin: I checked if there was a letter from someone else)

1434
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:14,740
(Seongmin: I looked to see if I can put it safely, but there was nothing)

1435
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:19,100
(Seongmin: So I just... thought to make a choice)

1436
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:33,580
(What's the meaning of the two letter boxes?)

1437
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:40,700
(Mail time is over)

1438
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:44,050
(Each man spent the fifth night in their own style)

1439
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:45,340
♫Lezzgo, lezzgo♫
(Each man spent the fifth night in their own style)

1440
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:45,740
(Each man spent the fifth night in their own style)

1441
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:47,370
♫Lezzgo, lezzgo♫
(Each man spent the fifth night in their own style)

1442
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:47,900
(Each man spent the fifth night in their own style)

1443
01:16:56,300 --> 01:17:00,020
(Seongmin: Are you tired?)
(Jaeseung: @%$^&^%)

1444
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:01,260
(Seongmin: What's wrong?)

1445
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:03,580
(Jaeseung: Seongmin)

1446
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:11,420
(Jaeseung: If there's a date tomorrow, do you want to go on a date with me?)
(Seongmin: Yeah)

1447
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:15,260
(Seongmin: Why?)
(Jaeseung: That's enough)

1448
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:17,780
(Seongmin: Of course. We missed the first three dates)

1449
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:20,020
(Hwi: Oh? Seongmin)

1450
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:23,700
(Hwi: Come outside...)

1451
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,900
(Seongmin: Hang on)

1452
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,860
(Hwi: Well, I...)

1453
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:34,620
(Hwi: Well, I have something to ask you)

1454
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:37,060
(Hwi: Can I ask?)
(Seongmin: Yes)

1455
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:39,780
(Seongmin: What is it?)
(Hwi: Well...)

1456
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,620
(Hwi: I don't know. I have a lot to say)

1457
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:44,300
(Hwi: Can I ask you just one question?)

1458
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:48,420
(Hwi: Before...)

1459
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:54,020
(Hwi: You said I was your first choice)

1460
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:59,580
(Hwi: Then we talked more...)

1461
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:04,140
(Hwi: I want to ask if you've a change of mind...)

1462
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:08,260
(Seongmin: Now?)

1463
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:17,940
(Seongmin: I think I've changed...)

1464
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:23,260
(Hwi: Oh... I have nothing to say...)

1465
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:26,540
(Seongmin: Sorry...)

1466
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,300
(Seongmin: Shouldn't we go in?)

1467
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:34,180
(Seongmin: Staying here's a bit...)
(Hwi: Got it)

1468
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:41,660
(The two men go back in)

1469
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:47,900
(Hwi: I just want to talk)

1470
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:51,340
(Hwi: I want to talk)

1471
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:54,660
(Hwi seems to have something to say)

1472
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:57,820
(Hwi: Goodness, I need to lie down for a while)

1473
01:18:57,820 --> 01:18:59,700
I need to lie down for a while.
(Hwi: Goodness, I need to lie down for a while)

1474
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:08,140
(Hwi: Tomorrow is the sixth day)

1475
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:11,100
(Hwi: Time flies)

1476
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:16,900
(Hwi: I’m curious now)

1477
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:23,260
(Hwi: Why... has your interest in me dropped?)

1478
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:26,620
(Seongmin: No. It's not your fault)

1479
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:31,260
(Hwi: I didn't say it's my fault)

1480
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:38,500
(Hwi: I'm just... curious why)

1481
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:50,780
(Seongmin hesitates to answer Hwi's question)

1482
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:57,300
(Seongmin: I'm slow to warm up to others)

1483
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:01,900
(Seongmin: I felt it after some time)

1484
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:06,460
(Seongmin: I realized I have stronger feelings for Jaeseung now)

1485
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:12,420
(Seongmin: I didn't want to hide it from you)

1486
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:15,820
(Hwi: Honestly, no matter how much I respect you,)

1487
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:16,700
(Hwi: I still...)

1488
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:19,020
(I still get jealous)

1489
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,100
Well...
(I still get jealous)

1490
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:21,230
Well...

1491
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:27,380
(Hwi: I don’t know. I get jealous when I see you (& Jaeseung) together)

1492
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:29,700
(Hwi: Although I respect you...)

1493
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:30,640
(Seongmin: What do you want me to do?)

1494
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:31,820
So...
(Seongmin: What do you want me to do?)

1495
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:33,900
(Seongmin: What do you want me to do?)

1496
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:34,490
(At that time, Jaeseung goes to the double room)

1497
01:20:34,490 --> 01:20:35,860
Sorry.
(At that time, Jaeseung goes to the double room)

1498
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:37,700
(At that time, Jaeseung goes to the double room)

1499
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:45,580
(Seeing them together, Jaeseung's lost in thought)

1500
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:53,820
(Hwi: Anyway, the situation has changed)

1501
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:58,980
(Hwi: But I don't think there's such thing as 0% or 100%)

1502
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:00,820
(Hwi: When we first went on a date,)

1503
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:04,820
(Hwi: we didn't know much about each other)

1504
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:10,380
(Hwi: After I expressed my feelings)

1505
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:15,020
(Hwi: and going through all kinds of things,)

1506
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:17,220
(Hwi: if we go on another date,)

1507
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:19,380
(Hwi: I'm sure I'll realize some things)

1508
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:23,380
(Hwi: and you will too)

1509
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:29,260
(Seongmin: To be honest, I don't know what to do now)

1510
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:31,980
(Seongmin: Are you not interested)

1511
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:33,820
(Seongmin: in anyone else?)

1512
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:39,460
(Hwi: Yes, I've been only been attracted to you)

1513
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:43,180
(Hwi: since the first day)

1514
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:44,960
(Seongmin is conflicted because of Hwi's honest response)

1515
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:48,360
I don't know what to do now.
(Seongmin is conflicted because of Hwi's honest response)

1516
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:50,260
(Seongmin is conflicted because of Hwi's honest response)

1517
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:54,540
(Seongmin: I think I should be true to my feelings)

1518
01:21:54,540 --> 01:22:00,580
(Seongmin: So I'm thinking about going on a date with Jaeseung)

1519
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:08,020
(Seongmin: I've always hoped you'd try dating)

1520
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:10,220
(Seongmin: someone else too)

1521
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:16,140
(Hwi: I don't think it's necessary now. Even if (I go on a date with others)...)

1522
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:25,500
(Other than you, it's all meaningless)

1523
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:32,540
(Hwi: I'm afraid you'll be troubled because of me,)

1524
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:38,380
(Hwi: so I thought about it a lot)

1525
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:42,420
(Hwi: But I can't help it)

1526
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:47,980
(Seongmin: Do you hate seeing me with Jaeseung?)

1527
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:50,300
(Hwi: No, it's not that I hate it)

1528
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:53,340
(I just feel sad)

1529
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:59,460
(Hwi: Today... yesterday and today,)

1530
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:05,620
(Hwi: you seem to be avoiding me)

1531
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:09,620
(Hwi: Maybe it's just me)

1532
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:13,660
(Hwi: But I feel so. That's why it's harder)

1533
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:19,020
(Seongmin: It's true that I can't face you because I feel guilty)

1534
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:22,980
(Seongmin: So I did avoid you a bit)

1535
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:24,110
(Seongmin: It's true)

1536
01:23:24,110 --> 01:23:25,220
Really
(Seongmin: It's true)

1537
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:28,460
(It'd be nice if you could smile at me)

1538
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:31,980
(Hwi: You're so cold...)

1539
01:23:37,230 --> 01:23:38,140
But I think...

1540
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:40,540
(Seongmin: Honestly, think about it)

1541
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:44,980
(Seongmin: I don't know how Jaeseung and I will turn out. Right?)

1542
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:46,780
(Seongmin: Putting aside the results,)

1543
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:48,180
(Seongmin: I want to follow my heart)

1544
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:52,260
(Seongmin: to make a choice)

1545
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:53,740
(Seongmin: I also don't want to lie to you)

1546
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:55,300
(Seongmin: That's why I'm telling you first)

1547
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:58,660
(Seongmin: Even if Jaeseung decides not to choose me in the end)

1548
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:00,860
(Seongmin: and he has a change of heart,)

1549
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:04,340
(Seongmin: I'd have no regrets)

1550
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:09,660
(Because of Seongmin's decisive words, Hwi looks visibly upset)

1551
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:16,140
(The awkward atmosphere in silence)

1552
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:21,060
(Hwi: Do you want me)

1553
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:26,020
(Hwi: to stop liking you?)

1554
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:32,460
(Seongmin: I wasn't lying)

1555
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:38,500
(Seongmin: when I said our personalities fit the best and whatnot)

1556
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:47,060
(Seongmin: Just think of it as me having a change of heart)

1557
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:53,020
(Seongmin: I think those were feelings in the past)

1558
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:57,180
(Seongmin: Just like I have different feelings now)

1559
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:03,900
(Hwi: That's a bit...)

1560
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:05,100
(Hwi: I don't know how to accept it)

1561
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:10,180
(Seongmin: I don't know what's the right thing to do)

1562
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:16,500
(Seongmin: So I'm going to follow my heart now)

1563
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:28,380
(Seongmin: I'm sorry)

1564
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:40,460
(Hwi: We talked too long, right?)

1565
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:44,740
(Hwi: Don’t avoid me because you feel sorry,)

1566
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:47,020
(Hwi: okay?)

1567
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:52,540
(Hwi: It hurts me more when you avoid me)

1568
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:57,100
(Hwi: Good night)

1569
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:06,380
(Seungjin: Where are you going?)
(Hwi: My room)

1570
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:08,780
(Seungjin: Do you want to be alone?)

1571
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:10,220
(Come here)

1572
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:16,620
(Hwi: I'm giving up)
(Seungjin: Why?)

1573
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:19,780
(Hwi: I'm giving up. He said no)
(Seungjin:, Mr. Whistle...)

1574
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:20,900
(Hwi: It won't work)

1575
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:23,620
(Seungjin: Why...?)

1576
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:26,980
(Hwi: I'm giving up)

1577
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:33,020
(Seungjin: What happened?)

1578
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:37,020
(Hwi: I'm giving up)

1579
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:43,260
(Seungjin: What happened?)
(Hwi: I don't know)

1580
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:45,460
(Hwi: I don’t know. I must be crazy)

1581
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:48,860
(Seungjin: Did something happen in that short period of time?)

1582
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:51,220
(Seungjin: Am I the only one out of the loop?)

1583
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:53,180
(Hwi: It’s not like that...)

1584
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:59,420
(Hwi: I went out to have a chat with him)

1585
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:05,180
(Seungjin: You know this?)

1586
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:09,380
(Seungjin: It feels like you'd die without him)

1587
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:16,100
(Seungjin: But if you look around, you realize it's not true)

1588
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:20,860
(Seungjin: It's not about)

1589
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:23,260
(Seungjin: if you should give up your feelings for Seongmin)

1590
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:26,900
(Seungjin: But that you should...)

1591
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:28,980
(Seungjin: You might feel better)

1592
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:33,340
(Seungjin: if you let go of a bit of your persistence on Seongmin)

1593
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:36,860
(Seungjin: I'm not asking you to stop liking him)

1594
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:43,740
(Seungjin: But you have to get rid of the feeling that he's the only one for you)

1595
01:27:43,740 --> 01:27:47,340
(Seungjin: Then you might feel better)

1596
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:55,100
(Seungjin: We agreed to only be happy today)

1597
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:59,460
(Seungjin: But it became the worst day in history)

1598
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:11,940
(Seungjin: You must be upset)
(Hwi: Yes)

1599
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:18,580
(Seungjin: It means you're growing up)

1600
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:26,900
(After Seungjin left, the third-floor single room feels extra empty)

1601
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:32,380
(Hwi's night that is particularly sad and lonely)

1602
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:40,740
(The next morning)

1603
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:46,020
(Those who left their letters in the same letter box will go on a date together)
(Right box: Hwi, Seungjin, Seongmin)
(Left box: Jaeseung, Hanmin, Minseon, Myeongkyun, Youngjoon)

1604
01:28:46,370 --> 01:28:48,510
I want to see what it is.

1605
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,860
(So this was what the letter boxes were about)

1606
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:55,380
(Oh!)

1607
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:58,660
(Jaeseung: Why is it so hard for me)

1608
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:00,180
(Jaeseung: when it's easy for others?)

1609
01:29:00,530 --> 01:29:02,060
One, two, three.

1610
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:09,300
(Jaeseung: I felt like how a typical single man would when stuck with couples)

1611
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:12,300
(I can't go on more rides)

1612
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:16,620
(He suddenly cancels on their date)

1613
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:22,260
(I miss Seongmin)

1614
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:23,500
(Meanwhile, the two who are getting closer)

1615
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:24,930
You did it on purpose.
(Meanwhile, the two who are getting closer)

1616
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:27,260
(Pretty)

1617
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:31,460
(Seungjin: I think I have a huge change of heart)

1618
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:35,540
(I'm interested in Hwi)

1619
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:41,100
(Seungjin: And I have something to ask Seongmin)

1620
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:47,100
(Seungjin: Right now, what's your relationship with Jaeseung?)

1621
01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:52,700
(Seungjin: Are (Seongmin & Hwi) really done with each other?)

1622
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:57,700
(Seongmin: Right now, I...)

1623
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:01,000
(A new man joins the battle; Is this the beginning of a love square?)
