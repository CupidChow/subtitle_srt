(Hanmin)

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,100
(Myeongkyun)

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,740
(Episode 14: After "Men's House")

10
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,540
(On a rainy day)

11
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:22,740
(Hanmin is waiting for someone nervously)

12
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,460
(Nervous)

13
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:41,460
(Another man walking towards Hanmin)

14
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,140
(Happy)

15
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,500
(Youngjoon: It took a long time)

16
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,860
(Youngjoon: Flowers for you)

17
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,540
(Hanmin: All of a sudden?)

18
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,580
(Youngjoon: I told you I'd get you flowers)

19
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,700
(Hanmin: I didn't expect it)

20
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,900
(The two men look at each other silently)

21
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,840
It's been a long time.
(The two men look at each other silently)

22
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,180
(Youngjoon: It's been two weeks... Over two weeks, right?)
(Hanmin: Yeah?)

23
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,260
(Youngjoon: Has it been over two weeks since we left? Less than two weeks?)

24
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,180
(Hanmin: Hasn't it been three weeks?)
(Youngjoon: So it's been three weeks now)

25
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,100
(Youngjoon: It's been over two weeks)

26
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,490
(Youngjoon: I might be getting an additional new job)
(Hanmin: Really?)

27
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:50,900
Like...
(Youngjoon: I might be getting an additional new job)
(Hanmin: Really?)

28
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,390
Like...

29
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,540
(Youngjoon: I got a job offer)
(Hanmin: Oh...)

30
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,900
(Youngjoon: I might have to be at the office a few days a week)

31
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,860
(Youngjoon: Nothing's set yet)

32
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,980
(Hanmin: It's good to be busy, but...)

33
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,220
(Youngjoon: But I'm not busy)

34
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,420
(Hanmin: Don't push yourself too much)
(Youngjoon: I'm not busy. I just have to sleep less)

35
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,060
(Youngjoon: I can make time)

36
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,660
(Hanmin: No one is taking care of us anymore)

37
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,340
(We both... Ah... Nothing...)

38
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,900
(With that, they get awkward quickly)

39
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,470
Thank you.

40
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,740
(Youngjoon: The knife's really pretty)
(Hanmin: Oh, right)

41
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,860
(Youngjoon: To think there'd come a day where I'd be drinking)

42
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,780
(Hanmin: Right. It's my first time drinking with you)
(Youngjoon: After drinking...)

43
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,660
(Please take care of me when I'm drunk)

44
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,580
(Shy)

45
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,060
(Youngjoon: Luckily it's not strong)
(Hanmin: Not strong? That's good)

46
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,820
(Hanmin: Your face is already...)
(Youngjoon: It should be because of the lighting)

47
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,220
(Awkward)

48
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,620
(Youngjoon: It's okay. After drinking it...)

49
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,740
(Youngjoon: I'd figure it out)

50
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,300
(Cheers)

51
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:37,100
(Their first cocktail date filled with nervousness and excitement)

52
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,260
(Youngjoon: Mmm... It's sweet and sour)

53
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,020
(Youngjoon: You're a good drinker)

54
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,980
(Hanmin: I like cocktails)
(Youngjoon: I like them too)

55
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,820
(I like it too)

56
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,660
(Hanmin: Actually...)
(Youngjoon: I have to take off my glasses)

57
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,980
(Hanmin: I might have to drink to say this)

58
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,380
(Nervous)

59
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,340
(Hanmin: I'm the type who needs time to decide on a romantic relationship)

60
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,940
(Hanmin: But the whole situation...)
(Youngjoon: It was short)

61
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:26,340
(Hanmin: In a short time, I'd to keep making choices)

62
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,860
(Hanmin: And in the show, I was too...)

63
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,220
(Hanmin: I think I didn't think too deeply)

64
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,420
(Hanmin: Because we're the same age, we can chat comfortably)

65
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:43,180
(Hanmin: We made rings like in a romance drama,)

66
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,060
(Hanmin: holding hands without care,)

67
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,780
(Hanmin: and went on dates)

68
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,420
(Youngjoon: First time hearing you say this)

69
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:00,300
(Hanmin: I thought a lot about it)

70
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,500
(Youngjoon: I felt it too)

71
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,660
(Youngjoon: When I first met you,)

72
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,820
(Youngjoon: you said you needed time)

73
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,060
(Youngjoon: While I decide quickly)

74
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,300
(Youngjoon: So...)

75
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,460
(I wanted to adjust to your speed)

76
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,500
(Youngjoon: It's not just in romantic relationships for me)

77
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,580
(Youngjoon: I try to get close with friends easily and quickly too)

78
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,820
(Youngjoon: I know I'm like this,)

79
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,020
(Youngjoon: so I'm always aware that the other party)

80
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,820
(Youngjoon: might feel burdened)

81
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,570
(Youngjoon: But sometimes my feelings take over too)

82
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,060
That's right.
(Youngjoon: But sometimes my feelings take over too)

83
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,659
That's right.

84
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,659
(Hanmin: But actually...)

85
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:46,580
(Hanmin: I know you've been considerate of me)

86
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,340
(Hanmin: But to be honest...)

87
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,540
(Hanmin: I can see that you're being considerate of me, but that itself makes me feel pressured)

88
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,780
(Hanmin: And the fact that I have other worries)

89
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,620
(Hanmin: really perplexed me)

90
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,860
(Hanmin: Anyway, this is what I think)

91
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,420
(Hanmin: I don't think two people who like each other)

92
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,860
(Hanmin: can like each other the same amount)

93
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,540
(Hanmin: I'd rather be the one)

94
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,300
(Hanmin: that likes the other more)

95
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,060
(Hanmin: Compared to those who like me more,)

96
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,780
(Hanmin: I prefer to be with someone I like more)

97
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,100
(Hanmin: Because only in this way)

98
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,580
(Hanmin: would I not be stressed out)

99
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,740
(Hanmin: about him getting hurt, even if it means I get hurt more)

100
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,180
(Youngjoon: Actually... I...)

101
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,420
(Youngjoon: If my words and actions pressured you,)

102
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:43,020
(Youngjoon: I think it'd be unfavorable for me)

103
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:51,060
(Hanmin: I don't think we're good as a couple)

104
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,360
And...

105
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,980
(Hanmin: No matter how you feel, I think I should...)

106
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,940
(Hanmin: Although it can't become a clean slate right away,)

107
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,220
(Hanmin: I think it’s right to draw the line clearly)

108
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:14,420
(It's a bit harsh but Hanmin makes it clear about wanting to break up)

109
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,860
(Choked up)

110
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,260
(Hanmin: I feel like you'd be left with a pathetic impression of me,)

111
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,780
(Hanmin: so I didn't want to cry in front of you)

112
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,740
(Youngjoon: But... I don't know)

113
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,780
(Youngjoon: Based on what I feel now and what I felt in the show,)

114
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,620
(Youngjoon: in a long time, or even for the first time,)

115
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,660
(Youngjoon: I saw a different side of me)

116
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,500
(Youngjoon: I know how I used to be)

117
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:03,700
(Youngjoon: I changed and acted differently)

118
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,260
(Youngjoon: and that felt novel to me)

119
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,740
(Youngjoon: That's why I...)

120
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:19,220
(I wanted to hold onto you and felt a strong bond)

121
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,220
(Hanmin: Every time I think about how I realized this only after the show ended,)

122
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,660
(Hanmin: to be honest, I regret it)

123
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,380
(Youngjoon: What kind of regrets are they?)

124
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,180
(Hanmin: Just like what I said,)

125
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,980
(Hanmin: being on the show)

126
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,940
(Hanmin: and making these rings)

127
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,940
(Hanmin: Why did we have to make rings?)

128
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:45,340
(Right... Why did we make rings...)

129
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,140
(Hanmin: Even if it's tough now, I still want to be friends with you)

130
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,060
(Hanmin: Or it might not work out)

131
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,460
(Hanmin: But I hope you can come to terms with this,)

132
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,460
(Hanmin: please)

133
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,180
(Hanmin: I have nothing else to say)

134
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,540
(Youngjoon: I understand what you mean)

135
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,700
(Youngjoon: I understand)

136
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,580
(But my heart really hurts after hearing it)

137
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:30,900
(Hanmin: And the ring...)

138
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,860
(Hanmin: I don't think I should wear it anymore)

139
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:43,740
(Couple rings that've lost its meaning)

140
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,420
(Youngjoon: You should go first)

141
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,180
(Youngjoon: Don't you want the flowers?)

142
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,220
(Youngjoon: It doesn't mean anything)

143
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,940
(Hanmin: But if I)

144
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,180
(Hanmin: take this...)

145
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,580
(Youngjoon: Throw it somewhere I can't see)

146
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:20,700
(The two chose to break up as they can't resolve their differences)

147
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:31,540
(The next afternoon)

148
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:41,590
(Minseon and Myeongkyun meet on Daehak-ro)

149
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,900
-Daehak-ro. -Yeah.
(Minseon and Myeongkyun meet on Daehak-ro)

150
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,940
I really...
(Minseon and Myeongkyun meet on Daehak-ro)

151
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,730
-A year? -A year?
(Minseon and Myeongkyun meet on Daehak-ro)

152
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,460
I haven't been here for over a year.
(Minseon and Myeongkyun meet on Daehak-ro)

153
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,700
(Myeongkyun: Art is something that makes life more interesting than art)

154
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,360
So that word is "interesting."

155
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,950
The theater here is nice.

156
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:01,140
(Walking leisurely on the streets together)

157
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,070
It's big.
(Walking leisurely on the streets together)

158
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:06,540
(Walking leisurely on the streets together)

159
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,220
(Where did they come to for a date?)

160
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,420
(Minseon: I love musicals so much)

161
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,670
I love them.
(Minseon: I love musicals so much)

162
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,300
(Minseon: I'm so curious about what it's about)
(Myeongkyun: "Zoo, Again")

163
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,340
(Minseon: To think you'd prepare such a surprise)

164
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,900
(Minseon: I'm so touched)

165
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,660
I know a thing or two about being thoughtful.

166
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,970
("Zoo, Again")
(Songs by the band Zoo and memories of Kim Kwang Seok)
(Myeongkyun prepared a thoughtful (?) musical date)
I know a thing or two about being thoughtful.

167
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,060
So...

194
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,700
(Not bad)
(Is it okay?)

195
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,980

It's too hasty.
(Only 10 seconds?)

207
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,430
It's too hasty.

208
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,300
(Posing well despite the rush)

209
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,300
What poses should we do?

210
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:01,430

(Touching)

252
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,540
(Minseon: How long has it been since we left Men's House?)

253
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,940
(Myeongkyun: About 3 to 4 weeks?)

254

255
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,180
(Myeongkyun: I think so)

256
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:02,100
(Minseon: It feels like it's been two months)

257
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,940
(Minseon: It's because we meet often)
(Myeongkyun: Yeah. It's because we meet often)

(Myeongkyun: For us,)

260

(Myeongkyun: in Men's House or outside,)

261
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:15,859
(Myeongkyun: we always have so much to talk about)

262
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:17,300
(Minseon: Having conversations feel the same)

263
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,420
(Minseon: But the situation has changed)

264
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,700
(Minseon: We slept together every day in Men's House,)

265
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,220
(Minseon: being together for almost 24 hours a day)

266
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,420
(Minseon: But now you've to work)

267
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,140
(Minseon: Although we have lesser time to meet,)

268
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,420
(Minseon: I think I feel and think the same)

269
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,500
(Minseon: as when I was in Men's House)

270
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,020
-In fact, I think it's been more... -Improving?

271

(Minseon: People)

276
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,540
(Minseon: all have flaws)

277
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,900
(Minseon: I think I have flaws too)

278
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,940
(Minseon: No one is perfect)

279
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,140
(Minseon: But you just need to meet someone who complements and accepts you)

280
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,140
(Minseon: with your flaws)

281
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,900
(Myeongkyun: I hope I can be that for you)

282
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,340
(Minseon: You are already that for me)
(Myeongkyun: Thank you)

283
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,260
(Minseon: Don't worry)

284
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,380
(Myeongkyun: Thank you for thinking that)

285
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,420
(Minseon: I hope you can be more fulfilled because of me too)

286
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:26,500
(Myeongkyun: Actually, among all the people I've dated so far,)

287
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,020
(Myeongkyun: how should I put it...)

288
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,530
I feel the happiest with you.

289
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,060
Really?

290
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,160
Emotionally.

291
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,460
(Minseon: You said you're not good at expressing yourself in Men's House)

292
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,610
(Minseon: But now that we're outside, you're good at expressing yourself)

293
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,100
I'm working very hard for it.
(Minseon: But now that we're outside, you're good at expressing yourself)

294
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,230
I'm working very hard for it.

295
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,230
-You are? -I am.

296
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,640
Every time I hear it, my heart flutters.

297
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,140
(Minseon: A person who is not good at expressing himself)

298
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,580
(Minseon: telling me such stuff really touches me)

299
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,140
(Myeongkyun: It's thanks to a place like Men's House)

300
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:55,140
(Myeongkyun: that I could express my feelings more)

301
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,340
(Minseon: I think so too)

302
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,020
(Minseon: Because there's a place like Men's House)

303
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,140
(Myeongkyun: So I think I made the right choice by going on the show)

304
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:03,340
(Minseon: It's a blessing to be on the show)

305
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,860
It's really a blessing. Right.
(Minseon: It's a blessing to be on the show)

306
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,780
(Minseon: It's a blessing to be on the show)

307
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,980
(Minseon: But I was worried about that)

308
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,180
(Myeongkyun: What?)
(Minseon: In Men's House,)

309
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,780
(Minseon: even if I have someone I like,)

310
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,780
(Minseon: he might not like me)

311
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:20,420
(Minseon: From before joining the show,)

312
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,020
(Minseon: I thought a lot about how it'd be if that happens)

313
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,260
(Minseon: But we chose each other after the show)

314
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,860
(Minseon: so I'm relieved)

315
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,660
Mmm...

316
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,590
(Myeongkyun seems to have something to say)
Mmm...

317
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:37,340
(Myeongkyun seems to have something to say)

318
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,220
(What's wrong?)

319
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,450
Well...

320
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,430
(How about we make today our first day?)

321
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,410
Huh?
(How about we make today our first day?)

322
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,870
Make today the first day as a couple?

323
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,520
Huh?

324
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,600
-Our first day? -Yes.

325
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,940
-Really? -Let's talk more on our way back.

326
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,300
(Touched)
-Really? -Let's talk more on our way back.

327

-Should we? -Really?
(Touched)

328
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,220
(Touched)

329
