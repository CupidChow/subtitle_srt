00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,780
(Youngjoon gets up from Minseon's spot?)

14
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,700
(On the contrary, Minseon's sleeping in Youngjoon's spot)

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,020
(Minseon: Youngjoon said)

16
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,100
(Minseon: With (Hanmin & I), who don't toss and turn, in a bed)

17
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,340
(Minseon: and (Youngjoon & Myeongkyun) in another,)

18
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,820
(Minseon: because they both toss and turn,)

19
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,140
(Minseon: one crashes on the floor and they bicker and whatnot)

20
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,940
(Minseon: So he said we should split up instead)

21
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,340
Should I take your spot today? Or...

22
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,490
(Discussing how to change their sleeping arrangement)
Should I take your spot today? Or...

23
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,090
leave Myeongkyun alone?
(Discussing how to change their sleeping arrangement)

24
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,030
(Minseon: Let's just switch)
(Youngjoon: Should we?)

25
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,030
-That's the most convenient. -Yes.
(Minseon: Let's just switch)
(Youngjoon: Should we?)

26
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,539
(Minseon: So we decided to change (our sleeping arrangement))

27
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,620

29
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:36,200
Hanmin was lying next to me.

30
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:40,020
(Youngjoon: When I opened my eyes, he was facing me)

31
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,860
(Youngjoon: My heart...)

32
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,780
(Heart fluttered)

33
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,979
(Are you going to sleep some more?)

34
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,300
(Are you going to sleep some more?)

35
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,380
(Sleep~)

36
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,259
(Hanmin: Once I opened my eyes, he asked if I slept well)

37
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:55,539
(Hanmin: We greeted each other)

38
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:57,100
(Hanmin: That was quite...)

39
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,580
(It made my heart flutter)

40
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,020
(Youngjoon: Let's start the day with the love fortune)

41
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,060
(More excited to hear his love fortune today)

42
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,579
(Having trouble opening it)

43
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,579
(Yap!)

44
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:30,380
(Show your interest to the other proactively to see results)

45
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,860
(Youngjoon: Show my interest proactively...)

46
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,660
(Hanmin wakes up and goes down to the first floor)

47
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,220
(Still working out)

48
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,460
(Youngjoon: You're up?)

49
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,100
(Hanmin: I just woke up and came down for coffee)

50
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,250
(Hanmin quietly moves to the spot beside Youngjoon)

51
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,400
Bicycle.
(Hanmin quietly moves to the spot beside Youngjoon)

52
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,610
(Hanmin quietly moves to the spot beside Youngjoon)

53
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,690
Bicycle?
(Hanmin quietly moves to the spot beside Youngjoon)

54
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:02,870
(Hanmin quietly moves to the spot beside Youngjoon)

55
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,070
I've been doing this.
(Hanmin quietly moves to the spot beside Youngjoon)

56
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:04,860
Like a pillow.

57
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,800
(Shaking their heads)
Like a pillow.

58
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,860
(Shaking their heads)

59
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,180
(Hanmin: Place this a little bit lower)

60
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:24,180
(Hanmin: Lean your back on it like this)

61
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:25,900
Lift your butt slightly.

62
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,640
(Hanmin's relaxed stretching)
Lift your butt slightly.

63
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,260
(Hanmin's relaxed stretching)

64
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:30,420
It can relax your back muscles.

65
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,750
(Youngjoon's awkward(?) stretching)
It can relax your back muscles.

66
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,290
(Youngjoon's awkward(?) stretching)

67
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,370
Like this?
(Youngjoon's awkward(?) stretching)

68
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,329
Huh?
(Youngjoon's awkward(?) stretching)

69
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,980
(Like this?)

70
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,980
Ah.

71
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,740
(Youngjoon: It feels awkward)

72
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:49,380
(Hanmin: But it might be awkward if you're not used to it)

73
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,300
(Hanmin: When will the others get up?)
(Youngjoon: No one wants to get up)

74
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,260
(Youngjoon: I got one as soon as I got up)
(Hanmin: Oh, the love fortune?)

75
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,980
(Hanmin also tests out his love fortune)

76
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,780
(Curious)

77
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,230
I think it's a long one.

78
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,740
(Don't judge a person just by their looks)

79
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,740
(An interesting(?) fortune)

80
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,660
(Youngjoon: Be careful!)

81
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,980
(Hanmin: I'll be careful)

82
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,860
(Hwi: Wow, I slept really well last night)

83
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,940
(Seongmin: Did you sleep well? That's good)

84
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,900
(Hwi: Did you sleep well?)
(Seongmin: Yes)

85
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,180
(Hwi: Because I got a call from Seongmin last night,)

86
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,140
(Hwi: I'm really happy)

87
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:43,180
(Hwi: When I woke up in the morning, I was happy too)

88
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,180
(Seongmin: When I woke up in the morning,)

89
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,020
(Seongmin: I realized I've been mentally exhausted since yesterday morning)

90
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,500
(Seongmin: I feel burdened too)

91
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,260
(Seongmin: I'm kind of at a loss)

92
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,659
(Single-room Jaeseung is up too)

93
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,060
(Jaeseung: I'm not in a good mood today)

94
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,020
(Jaeseung: After the call session yesterday,)

95
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,740
(Jaeseung: I'm... quite at a loss)

96
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,180
(Jaeseung: I feel like I'm...)

97
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,300
(Jaeseung: It feels like I'm being left out)

98
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,300
(They're sleeping so soundly)

99
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,340
(Minseon & Myeongkyun are still in dreamland)

100
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,100
(Fidgeting)
(Youngjoon: Get more sleep)

101
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,180
(Lies down again)

102
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,900
(Youngjoon: Now that we've come up,)

103
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,180
(Youngjoon: would they put the mission cards on the living room table now?)

104
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,260
(Youngjoon: Go check it out while I'm washing up)
(Hanmin: Okay)

105
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,060
(Youngjoon: We don't know what we'll do, so I don't know what to wear)

106
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,860
(Youngjoon: What are you going to wear?)

107
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,900
(Youngjoon: I'm undecided between)

108
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,780
(Youngjoon: this yellow shirt or...)

109
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,500
(Youngjoon: These are shorts. Like this)

110
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,540
(Recommends shorts)
(Hanmin: I think you'll look like an idol in these)

111
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,540
(Youngjoon: Should I wear this? Something different)

112
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,220
(Youngjoon: A new look)

113
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,860
(Waking up at the same time)

114
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:18,740
Both of you suddenly...

115
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,240
(Laughing)
Both of you suddenly...

116
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,740
(Laughing)

117
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,020
(How did we get up at the same time?)

118
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,300
(Hanmin: It's still before 10 a.m.)

119
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,460
(Minseon: I'm so, so happy (to have slept well)~)

120

(Hwi passes by without seeing the mission cards)

121
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,340
(Today's mission awaiting the men)

122
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,300
(Hwi notices the mission cards first)

123
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,700
(Startled)

124
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,300
(Hwi: My heart suddenly dropped)

125
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,980
(Hwi: So I wanted to ignore it)

126
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:15,380
(You'll be changing rooms today. Someone assigned everything.)
(3F single room: Hwi)
(2F quad room: Minseon, Seungjin, Myeongkyun, Youngjoon)
(2F single room: Jaeseung)
(1F double room: Seongmin, Hanmin)

127
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,940
(Hwi: Did you see the cards?)
(Seongmin: What did you see?)

128
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,980
(Seongmin: What is it?)

129
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,800
(Seongmin: Why? What is it?)

130
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,700
-It's crazy. -To think I was just dawdling around.
(Seongmin: Why? What is it?)

131
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,600
-It's crazy. -To think I was just dawdling around.

132
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:33,580
(The new rooming arrangements made by Seongmin written on the card)

133
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:36,780
Oh no.

134
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,460
(Uneasy)
Oh no.

135
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,100
(Uneasy)

136
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,860
(Ah~)

137
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,340
(Ah~~~~)

138
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,100
(Hwi: Have you seen it?)

139
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,700
(Seongmin: Yes, I did)
(Hwi: I'm so screwed)

140
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,700
(Hwi: Why am I in the third-floor single room?)

141
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,110
(Seongmin is flustered by Hwi's reaction)

142
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,290
This is crazy.
(Seongmin is flustered by Hwi's reaction)

143
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,580
(Seongmin: I can't share a room with Hwi from now on)

144
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,260
(Seongmin: I was upset)

145
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,180
(Seongmin: I wanted to share a room with Hwi until the end)

146
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,980
(Hwi: Your room hasn't changed, has it?)
(Seongmin: Yeah)

147
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,100
(Hwi: What do you think about your roommate?)

148
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,220
(Pretending not to know)
(Seongmin: I didn't see who my roommate is)

149
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,880
(Hwi: Isn't it him? Hanmin?)

150
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,340
Yes.
(Hwi: Isn't it him? Hanmin?)

151
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,010
Yes.

152
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:25,380
(Hwi: How can I move to the third floor? It's too much work)
(Seongmin: I'll help you when you move)

153
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,420
(I'll go to the third floor often)

154
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,670
(Hwi: Who changed it?)

155
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,800
Seriously.
(Hwi: Who changed it?)

156
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,260
(Wary)

157
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:39,580
(Seongmin: Has everyone seen the cards?)
(Hwi: No, I didn't check)

158
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:47,200
(Seongmin: Did we see them first?)
(Hwi: Oh, the others? Is that so?)

159
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,530
Is that so?
(Seongmin: Did we see them first?)
(Hwi: Oh, the others? Is that so?)

160
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,060
(Sigh...)

161
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,060
(Seongmin: What should I do?)

162
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,860
Did you see the cards?

163
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,320
(Next, Youngjoon & Jaeseung check the mission cards)
Did you see the cards?

164
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,230
Do you have a card?
(Next, Youngjoon & Jaeseung check the mission cards)

165
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,360
I checked it more than ten times today.
(Next, Youngjoon & Jaeseung check the mission cards)

166
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,740
(Listening intently)

(Opening the door to snoop(?) on them properly)

168
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,650
I checked it more than ten times today.

169
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,940
(Oh no~)

170

(Oh no~)

171
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,380
(Jaeseung: Is it what I thought?)

172
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,020
(Youngjoon: Yes, that)
(Jaeseung: About roommates?)

173
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,060
(Youngjoon: Someone assigned everything?)

174
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,340
(Youngjoon: Huh? Who decided it and how?)

175
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,180
(Jaeseung: Seongmin and Hwi's names stood out to me the most)

176
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,380
(I don't know who arranged it, but I'm satisfied)

177
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:41,540
(Jaeseung: Am I the only one who hasn't changed?)
(Youngjoon: I haven't either. And Minseon and Myeongkyun)

178
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,280
Am I going to the third floor?
(Jaeseung: Am I the only one who hasn't changed?)
(Youngjoon: I haven't either. And Minseon and Myeongkyun)

181
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,400
(Youngjoon suspects Jaeseung)

182
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,220
Do you think it was me?
(Youngjoon suspects Jaeseung)

183
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,040
-Only you... -I really...
(Youngjoon suspects Jaeseung)

184
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,620
I can say for sure it wasn't me.
(Youngjoon suspects Jaeseung)

189
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,300
(Hwi: Be honest and I’ll let you off)
(Jaeseung: It really wasn't me!)

I don't trust you.

(Feeling so wronged)
I don't trust you.

(Feeling so wronged)

194
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,260
(Jaeseung: Wait, it really wasn't me)

195
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:17,100
(Listening in) (Seongmin: This is driving me crazy)

196
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,740
Seungjin will go to the second floor.

197
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:18,950
(Youngjoon: But it's okay. I'm fine with it)
Seungjin will go to the second floor.

198

199
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,820
(Youngjoon: I'm in the same room, so it's okay)

200
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,220
(Youngjoon: I don't have to move my luggage)

201
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,490
(Hwi: I'm on the third floor)

202
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,340
-Move from the first floor to the third floor... -What's written on it?

(Youngjoon: The rooming arrangement has changed. It's fixed)

208
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,520
He looks upset.

(Everyone's in chaos because of the rooming changes)

210
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,850
I just did my hair.
(Everyone's in chaos because of the rooming changes)

211
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,090
No way.

212
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,580
(Youngjoon: But it's okay. You're using the same room)
(Minseon: I'm using the same room?)

213
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,340
(Minseon: Who am I sharing it with? The quad room?)

214
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,510
(Youngjoon: Yes, as before. Myeongkyun too)

215
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,710
He looks happy again.
(Youngjoon: Yes, as before. Myeongkyun too)

216
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,740
(Minseon: The room hasn't changed)

217
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,660
(Minseon: and I'm glad I'm still in the same room as (Myeongkyun))

218
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,380
(Minseon: To be honest, I felt relieved)

219
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:56,580
-No, Seungjin is going up. -I'm going up too.

220
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,370
-No, Seungjin is going up. -I'm going up too.

221
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,290
Hwi's going up too.

222
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,740
Seungjin is in our room.

223
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,830
(Hanmin: What’s going on?)

224
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,350
-Is Seungjin coming to our room? -Yes.
(Hanmin: What’s going on?)

225
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,020
-Still... -Wait...

226
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,590
(Hanmin: I have to go down?)
-Still... -Wait...

227
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,060
(Hanmin: I have to go down?)

228
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,700
(Hanmin: To be honest, I was a little frustrated)

229
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,020
(Hanmin: (Youngjoon) was always beside me, so we talked face to face)

230
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,740
(Hanmin: before bed quite often)

231
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,140
(Hanmin: I kept thinking)

232
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,460
(Hanmin: I'd feel a little empty)

233
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,620
(Youngjoon: Hwi's going up and Hanmin's going down)

234
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,840
Gosh, it wasn't me. It wasn't!

235
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,780
Only three people are moving?

236
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:29,800
(Hwi: Tell me the truth and I’ll let you off)

(The search is narrowing down to Jaeseung)

239
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,890
After leaving yesterday, did you...
(The search is narrowing down to Jaeseung)

240
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,480
-The two of them? -Did you write this outside?

The two of them.
(The search is narrowing down to Jaeseung)

243
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,260
That's too much.

244

(I'll just shut up)
That's too much.

245
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,380
(I'll just shut up)

246
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,570
-I'm so pitiful now. -I'll stop talking.
(I'll just shut up)

247
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,500

(Hwi: Is he trying to)

251
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,980
(Hwi: separate me from Seongmin?)

252
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,020
(Hanmin: (Jaeseung) seems to have a lot of secrets)

253
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,980
(Hanmin: and Seongmin and Hwi are separated. So it seems like (Jaeseung) separated them on purpose)

254
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,340
(Jaeseung: Everyone is suspicious of me)

255
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,820

(Minseon: Our rooming arrangement's changed)

258
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,860
Our rooming arrangement's changed.
(Minseon: Our rooming arrangement's changed)

(Minseon: No, it's the same for us. It's written over there)

262

266

(Myeongkyun: I wasn't sure about who it could be (that made the rooming changes))

267
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,660
(Myeongkyun: Now there are more people in our room that takes longer showers)

268
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,180
(Myeongkyun: So I need to use my prep time more efficiently)

269
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,780

(Seungjin's the last to check it)

(Seungjin: Huh?)

272
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,660
(Seungjin: I think it's too extreme)

273
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,660

274

286
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,020
(Hwi: After the assignment of the rooms, Hanmin walked into my room)

287
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,340
(Hwi: and he looked very happy)

288

(Hwi: Although he’s always smiling,)

289

290
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,760
(Hwi: it was really... To be honest, I’m sorry, but it was really annoying)

291

So...
(Hwi: it was really... To be honest, I’m sorry, but it was really annoying)

Oh, Seungjin is moving to the quad room.
(Hanmin: Seungjin also broke down just now)

298

(Seongmin: Oh no. What should I do?)

300
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,660
(Hwi: I think if I'm on the third floor,)

301
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,540
(Hwi: Seungjin will come visit me every day, because he can't stay in the quad room)

302
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,180
(Seongmin: Yes, of course. Seungjin can’t stay there)

00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,630
It's the fourth day.

320
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,260
I'm going crazy.

321
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:53,940
(Hwi: It's the toughest hurdle in my 22 years of living)
I'm going crazy.

322
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,740
(Hwi: It's the toughest hurdle in my 22 years of living)

323
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,870
Unbelievable.

324
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,870
(Worried about Seungjin)
(Seongmin: Has Seungjin gone outside?)

325
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,820
What?
(Worried about Seungjin)
(Seongmin: Has Seungjin gone outside?)

326
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,300
(Worried about Seungjin)
(Seongmin: Has Seungjin gone outside?)

327
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,020
(Going to Seungjin)

328
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,060
Did you check out the room?
(Going to Seungjin)

329
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:17,460
(Hwi: How do you feel about the quad room? You don't like it?)
(Sighs instead of answering)

330
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,380
(Seungjin: Well, okay. It's okay to live with many people)

331
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,220
(Seungjin: But sharing a bed is...)

332
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,240
(Seungjin: I think I'm going crazy)

333
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,300
I don't like it too.
(Seungjin: I think I'm going crazy)

334
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,460
(Seungjin: I think I'm going crazy)

335
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,300
(Seungjin: Who lives in the single room?)
(Hwi: Jaeseung didn't change his room)

336
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,380
(Hwi: I think Jaeseung arranged it)

337
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,070
(Seungjin: What's wrong with him?)
(Hwi: It must be Jaeseung. Really)

338
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,820
Is he playing the king?
(Seungjin: What's wrong with him?)
(Hwi: It must be Jaeseung. Really)

339
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,420
(More and more suspicious of Jaeseung)

340
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,820
Gosh. Since yesterday, he's been so crazy.
(More and more suspicious of Jaeseung)

341
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,300
(More and more suspicious of Jaeseung)

342
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:52,180
(After Hwi left, Seongmin is alone)

343
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,540
(Seongmin: Filling up Hwi's empty spot with his photo)

344
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,340
(Seongmin: I feel like I've become the villain)

345
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,180
(Seongmin: Honestly, I feel so sorry)

346
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,900
(Seongmin: I'm so conflicted)

347
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,700
Some of Hwi's stuff is still here.

348
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,550
(New roommate Hanmin comes with his luggage)
Some of Hwi's stuff is still here.

349
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,130
(New roommate Hanmin comes with his luggage)

350
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,290
Wait. Put this here for now.
(New roommate Hanmin comes with his luggage)

351
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,420
(New roommate Hanmin comes with his luggage)

352
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,970
(Seongmin: Hwi’s luggage is now...)
(Youngjoon: You can leave it here)

353
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,140
When Seungjin is done, Hwi can move his stuff up.
(Seongmin: Hwi’s luggage is now...)
(Youngjoon: You can leave it here)

354
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,460
When Seungjin is done, Hwi can move his stuff up.

355
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:31,770
(Because Seongmin feels sorry, he helps to pack Hwi's stuff)
When Seungjin is done, Hwi can move his stuff up.

356
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:34,030
Anyway, just move them little by little.
(Because Seongmin feels sorry, he helps to pack Hwi's stuff)

357
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,750
-It's difficult. -Let's go eat first.

358
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,150
-It's difficult. -Okay.

359
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,550
(Seongmin: Have you moved everything?)
(Hanmin: Yes. I brought all my stuff)

360
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,430
Okay.
(Seongmin: Have you moved everything?)
(Hanmin: Yes. I brought all my stuff)

361
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,210
(Youngjoon: Have you eaten?)
(Seongmin: I haven't eaten yet)

362
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:43,970
Let's eat.
(Youngjoon: Have you eaten?)
(Seongmin: I haven't eaten yet)

363
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,140
(Youngjoon: Have you eaten?)
(Seongmin: I haven't eaten yet)

364
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,130
(Hanmin: Ah, I'm so tired...)

365
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,490
There are cornflakes.
(Hanmin: Ah, I'm so tired...)

366
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,140
Are we three eating first?

367
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:49,550
(The three have a late breakfast)
Are we three eating first?

368
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,020
-Others... -Almost everyone else has eaten already.
(The three have a late breakfast)

369
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,370
-Right. -Okay.
(The three have a late breakfast)

370
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,180
(The three have a late breakfast)

371
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:54,540
-It's raining. -Gosh, really.

372
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,420
(It's raining)
-It's raining. -Gosh, really.

373
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:57,660
It's pouring.

374
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,570
(It's dark and even raining)
It's pouring.

375
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,700
(It's dark and even raining)

376
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,620
(Seongmin: I had a really good sleep)

377
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,619
(Seongmin: I slept the best since I came here)

378
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:08,660
(Youngjoon: Do you know your dark circles are different from yesterday?)
(Seongmin: Right? It was bad yesterday, right?)

379
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,660
(Seongmin: I was so stressed yesterday)

380
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,760
(Youngjoon: I thought your eyeshadow had smudged)
(Puhahaha)

381
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,790
Really.
(Youngjoon: I thought your eyeshadow had smudged)
(Puhahaha)

382
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,020
(Youngjoon: I thought your eyeshadow had smudged)
(Puhahaha)

383
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:21,619
(Seongmin: I was mentally exhausted, so my dark circles were strong yesterday)

384
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:25,540
(Youngjoon: Mentally exhausted? To decide on our rooming?)
(Seongmin: What are you talking about?)

385
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,820
(Youngjoon: To assign our rooms?)
(Seongmin: No, it wasn't me)

386
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,980
(He avoids eye contact with them)

387
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,110
-I said it wasn't me. -Those two who went out yesterday.

388
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,700
(Seongmin: I wasn't one of the two who went out yesterday)
(Youngjoon: You went out last night)

389
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,700
-You went out last night. -At night.
(Seongmin: I wasn't one of the two who went out yesterday)
(Youngjoon: You went out last night)

390
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,740
(Seongmin: I wasn't one of the two who went out yesterday)
(Youngjoon: You went out last night)

391
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,660
(Hanmin: We thought it must be one of you two)
(Seongmin: No)

392
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:48,260
(Youngjoon: No one knows how the person got this privilege)
(Seongmin: Yes)

393
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,420
(Youngjoon: Also, I think)

394
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,140
(Youngjoon: the person would've stayed put in their room)

395
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,740
(Seongmin: So since Jaeseung and I haven't changed rooms,)

396
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,340
(Seongmin: it must be us?)

397
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,620
(Seongmin: No. That's too far-fetched a guess)

398
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,980
Didn't you think about this?

399
00:17:59,980 --> 00:17:59,990
(Seongmin: Maybe he wants to share a room with someone... Maybe there)
Didn't you think about this?

400
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:03,060
(Seongmin: Maybe he wants to share a room with someone... Maybe there)

401
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,140
(Youngjoon: We don't think so.)

402
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,180
(Youngjoon: I personally think it's Seongmin (who changed our rooms))

403
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,940
(Youngjoon: Because of the conflict between Hwi and Jaeseung,)

404
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,460
(Youngjoon: he's mentally exhausted)

405
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,020
(Youngjoon: So, without moving himself,)

406
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:22,740
(Youngjoon: he chose a new roommate who he's not close to yet)

407
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,940
(Youngjoon: I think that's the biggest reason he arranged it like this)

408
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,540
(Seongmin: I can't keep a poker face)

409
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,660
(Seongmin: I tried my best to deny it and avoid looking them in the eyes)

410
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,220
(Seongmin: But I think they're suspicious of me)

411
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,260
(Laughing)

412
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,260
(Youngjoon: It's like the start of an internal strife)

413
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:45,480
(Seongmin: We're like in... a survival competition)

414
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:45,620
We're all dead.
(Seongmin: We're like in... a survival competition)

415
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,450
We're all dead.

416
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,400
(Seongmin: But since it's the fourth day... Yeah...)

417
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,450
Yeah, we're halfway in.
(Seongmin: But since it's the fourth day... Yeah...)

418
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,620
(Seongmin: But since it's the fourth day... Yeah...)

419
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,980
(Seongmin: Come to think of it, it's the second day (for Hanmin))
(Hanmin: Yes)

420
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,020
(Youngjoon: It's the third day today)
(Hanmin: It's the third day)

421
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,700
(Seongmin: To be honest, I haven't even looked at Hanmin's face properly)

422
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,740
(Seongmin: Well, because I...)

423
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,370
(Sorry X2)

424
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:04,780
-Because... -Sorry, it's my fault.
(Sorry X2)

425
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,460
(Sorry X3)
-Because... -Sorry, it's my fault.

426
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:05,720
(Sorry X4)

427
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,030
-Because... -Sorry.
(Sorry X4)

428
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:08,940
(Sorry X4)

429
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,540
(Seongmin: I don't come to the first-floor living room often and I get up late)

430
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,180
(Seongmin: So I haven't seen (Hanmin) often)

431
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:14,860
So...
(Seongmin: So I haven't seen (Hanmin) often)

432
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,250
(Youngjoon: And you weren't here tonight)
So...

433
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,580
I mean last night.
(Youngjoon: And you weren't here tonight)

434
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,100
(Youngjoon: And you weren't here tonight)

435
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,020
(Seongmin: Yes, yes)

436
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,740
(Seongmin: I didn't stay at home often too. That's why)

437
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:28,220
(Youngjoon: If Seongmin assigned Hanmin to a double room with him because he likes him,)

438
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,620
(Youngjoon: of course I'm concerned)

439
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,420
(Youngjoon: But Hanmin isn't mine yet)

440
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:40,220
(Youngjoon: I think Hanmin should get to know others too)

441
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:46,780
(Hwi is packing now)

442
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,300
(Bump)

443
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,580
(Can't bear to leave)

444
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,540
(Turning back)

445
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,380
(Bending down)

446
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,460
(Hwi: My photo is on the bedside table)

447
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,420
(Hwi: That made me a bit relieved)

448
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,820
(Hwi: In my stead, those photos)

449
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,460
(Hwi: will watch (Hanmin & Seongmin))

450
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,860
(Hwi: so they don't fool around)

451
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,340
(Seongmin stepped on something)
(Seongmin comes to the third floor to help Hwi unpack)

452
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,180
(Seongmin comes to the third floor to help Hwi unpack)

453
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,560
Hey, what is this?
(Seongmin comes to the third floor to help Hwi unpack)

454
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,410
Almonds.

455
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,500
(Bump)

456
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,850
(Already struggling in the third floor)

457
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,450
-Are you okay? -Who was it?
(Already struggling in the third floor)

458
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,100
(Already struggling in the third floor)

459
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,180
(Who was it!)

460
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:44,540
-I want to sleep with the door open. Really. -Oh no.
(Who was it!)

461
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,700
-I want to sleep with the door open. Really. -Oh no.

462
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:45,800
(Who was it?)
-I want to sleep with the door open. Really. -Oh no.

463

(Who was it?)

464
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,320
-This one... -It's fine now.

465
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,780
(Seongmin: Seungjin, are you okay?)

466
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,780
(Did you change our rooms?)
(No... It wasn't me...)

467
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,340
(How could it be me?)

468
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,220
(Minseon: If I was in charge of assigning the rooms, I'd have left Seungjin alone)

469
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:01,900
-He needs to live alone. -That's right.

470
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,570
(That's right~~~~~)
-He needs to live alone. -That's right.

471

(That's right~~~~~)

472
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,700
(Minseon: Seungjin is very angry)

473
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,240
(Troubled)
Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

474
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,260
(Troubled)

475
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,500
(Seungjin: Gosh, I've been staying out of all the drama)

476
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,370
(Seungjin: Why am I implicated in this mess?)

477
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:19,380
-From yesterday... Calm him down now.
(Seungjin: Why am I implicated in this mess?)

478
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,140
-From yesterday... Calm him down now.

479
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,380
From yesterday.

480
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,500
(Seungjin: I stayed around like a shadow)

481
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,060
(I'll just dump it all in. Whatever)

482
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,060
(Men quietly comfort Seungjin)
It's okay. You didn't sweat anyway.

483
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,710
(Men quietly comfort Seungjin)

484
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,600
No, it's not about sweat.
(Men quietly comfort Seungjin)

485
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,020
They're all worn clothes anyway.
(Men quietly comfort Seungjin)

486
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,980
(Minseon: But it's better than moving to the first floor)
(Seungjin: Yes)

487
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,860
(Minseon: Let's be optimistic)

488
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,300
(Seungjin: If it was that, he'd have really crossed the line)

489
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,940
(Seongmin: While moving, Seungjin looked... very upset)

490
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:53,540
(Seongmin: I felt sorry towards Seungjin for assigning the rooms without thinking of his stance)

491
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,860
(Seungjin: Everything that's going on here)

492
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,380
(Seungjin: is very stimulating for me)

493
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,980
(Seungjin: The time I get to spend alone is really precious to me)

494
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:09,420
(Seungjin: I feel like I'm being deprived of that time, so I'm at a loss)

495
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,250
(Jaeseung: It'd take the whole day to move)

496
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:12,460
-This won't do. -I'll...
(Jaeseung: It'd take the whole day to move)

497
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:12,860
-This won't do. -I'll...

498
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,730
(To help Seungmin move his stuff, the men gather on the third floor)
-This won't do. -I'll...

499
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,150
-Take this... -Like this.
(To help Seungmin move his stuff, the men gather on the third floor)

500
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,320
Like this.
(To help Seungmin move his stuff, the men gather on the third floor)

501
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,900
-Like this? Can it be done? -No.

502
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,080
(A lot)
-Like this? Can it be done? -No.

503
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,660
-This one... -Then I don't have to carry anything.
(A lot)

504
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,940
-This one... -Then I don't have to carry anything.

505
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,300
(Struggling awkwardly)
-This one... -Then I don't have to carry anything.

506
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,830
How did it become like this?
(Struggling awkwardly)

507
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,130
(Struggling awkwardly)

508
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,980
-Hold on. I'll carry it. -I can't go down.
(Struggling awkwardly)

509
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,180
-Hold on. I'll carry it. -I can't go down.

510
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,340
(After a long time to packing, they're finally being moved)
-Hold on. I'll carry it. -I can't go down.

511
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,600
-Be careful. -No, I...
(After a long time to packing, they're finally being moved)

512
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:28,810
(After a long time to packing, they're finally being moved)

513
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,780
-Is this mine? -Be careful.
(After a long time to packing, they're finally being moved)

514
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,140
No, for that, I'll...

515
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,280
(Careful)
No, for that, I'll...

516
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,380
(Careful)

517
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,180
(Jaeseung: It's like a whole community is moving villages)

518
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,420
(Jaeseung: I don't know if I'm carrying one person's luggage or four people's)

519
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,620
-Are you okay? -I think so.

520
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,100
(A bunch of people)
-Are you okay? -I think so.

521
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,630
You're holding the wheels.
(A bunch of people)

522
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,930
(A bunch of people)

523
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:45,840
Seriously.
(A bunch of people)

524
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,060
Wow.

525
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,700
(Seungjin's mover +2)
Wow.

526
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,720
(Seungjin's mover +3)

527
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,540
It's tough holding the wheels, right?
(Seungjin's mover +3)

528
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,260
(Seungjin's mover +4)
It's tough holding the wheels, right?

529
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:52,820
(Seungjin's mover +4)

530
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,840
Okay.
(Seungjin's mover +4)

531
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,340
(Seungjin's mover +4)

532
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,100
(Seungjin's mover +5)

533
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:55,300
-Here, here. -Where should I put it?

534
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,150
(Successfully moved to the quad room)
-Here, here. -Where should I put it?

535
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,020
(Successfully moved to the quad room)

536
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,340
Gosh.

537
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:00,620
(Clapping together)
Gosh.

538
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,550
(Clapping together)

539
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,340
-Everyone. -There's one bag left, right?
(Clapping together)

540
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,060
(Seungjin: Everyone, I'll treat you to a meal)
(Seongmin: It's fine...)

541
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,500
(Minseon: I won't refuse!)

542
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,660
(Seongmin: Jaeseung, which room do you live in?)
(Jaeseung: I'm still in the same room...)

543
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,460
(Jaeseung assigned the rooms)

544
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,260
-Seriously. -Almost said that.
(Jaeseung assigned the rooms)

545
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,420
(Jaeseung assigned the rooms)

546
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,860
(Hwi: You were too much)
(Jaeseung: It wasn't me!)

547
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,620
(Seungjin: Alright... Everyone...)

548
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,700
(Seungjin: There must be a reason for this)

549
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,260
(Seungjin: I believe in that)

550
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,620
(Seongmin: Yes. He must have his reasons)

551
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,460
(Seungjin: Youngjoon)
(Youngjoon: Oh!)

552
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,220
(Seungjin: Do you want to share a bed with me?)

553
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,860
(Youngjoon: I'd love to)

554
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,940
(Youngjoon: But I'd be annoyed to see (Minseon & Myeongkyun) sharing a bed)

555
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,740
(Seungjin: Oh, really? Then...)
(Youngjoon: What should we do?)

556
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,940
(Seungjin: That's a good idea)
(Youngjoon: Right?)

557
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,060
(Seungjin: That's a good idea. Then should I share a bed with Myeongkyun?)

558
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,660
(Seungjin: No, I'll share a bed with Minseon)

559
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,860
(Minseon: What's... What's wrong with everyone? Leave us alone)

560
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,060
(Seungjin: Should I share a bed with Minseon?)

561
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,300
(Minseon: Leave us alone!)

562
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,180
(Youngjoon: I'm fine with either of them. I just want to separate them)

563
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,620
(Seungjin: Then I'll share a bed with Minseon)

564
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,740
(Minseon: I don't want that. I've been...)

565
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,340
(Why are you doing this to me?)

566
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,900
(I didn't do anything!)

567
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,020
(Youngjoon: It's a shame, but I understand that I can't share a bed with Hanmin)

568
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,780
(Youngjoon: But why must I watch)

569
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,140
(Youngjoon: (Minseon & Myeongkyun) be lovey-dovey beside me?)

570
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,540
(Youngjoon: At the very least, I won't let them share a bed)

571
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:26,100
(Youngjoon: I can't stand to see them sleep together)

572
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,700
(Youngjoon: We're all wearing colorful clothes today)

573
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,890
How's my makeup today?

574
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,340
(Seongmin seems uncomfortable and leaves the room everyone was in)

575
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:46,300
(Seongmin goes back to his room) (He tries to calm down)

576
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:55,260
(Exhaling)

577
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:06,100
(He wants to cry)

578
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:24,180
(Feeling sorry and frustrated, he couldn't keep his tears in)

579
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:50,020
(Hectic and complicated morning)

580
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:55,700
(What kind of day will the men have?)

581
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,700
(Hanmin comes to see Seongmin alone)

582
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,660
(Hanmin: Are you doing your hair?)
(Seongmin: Yes I want to do my hair)

583
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,080
What's wrong?

584
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,650
(Realizes Seongmin is crying)

585
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,850
What's wrong?
(Realizes Seongmin is crying)

586
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:11,340
(Realizes Seongmin is crying)

587
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:16,260
(Seongmin: Ah... I'm so exhausted)
(Hanmin: Exhausted?)

588
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:21,780
(Seongmin: Very...very... How should I put it?)

589
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,060
(Seongmin: I don't know what to do)

590
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,580
(Seongmin: I seem to have become a bad person)

591
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,140
(Hanmin: Not at all!)

592
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:35,820
(Seongmin: No, I think it's just...)
(Hanmin: Not at all)

593
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:41,500
(Hanmin: No one thinks of you as a bad guy, except you)

594
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:49,100
(Hanmin: But I think you'd still be under pressure)

595
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:49,930
(Hanmin thinks Seongmin's troubled because of the love triangle)

596
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:53,340
You're grateful that people like you.
(Hanmin thinks Seongmin's troubled because of the love triangle)

597
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,940
-But it's also a lot of pressure, actually. -Yes.
(Hanmin thinks Seongmin's troubled because of the love triangle)

598
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,860
(Hanmin: Just like Seongmin,)

599
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:03,020
(Hanmin: some people are stressed out)

600
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,420
(Hanmin: So I thought about how I should help them)

601
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,860
(Hanmin: I gave them as much advice as possible)

602
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,900
(Seongmin: Thank you so much)

603
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,580
(Seongmin: It's my first time experiencing this)

604
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:21,580
(Seongmin: Early in the morning, after I got the text to re-assign the rooms, I became so conflicted)

605
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:25,180
(Seongmin: I think I only thought of myself)

606
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:30,260
(Seongmin: I didn't think about anyone else while deciding it)

607
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,860
(Seongmin: I was conflicted)

608
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,820
(Jaeseung: Goodness. What are you doing?)

609
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,980
(Jaeseung: What are you doing? Why?)

610
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:51,660
(Jaeseung finds Seongmin crying)

611
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,260
(Hanmin: Tissues... Wait a minute)

612
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:14,340
(Jaeseung leaves quietly)

613
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,780
(Jaeseung: I felt flustered, so I left)

614
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:23,260
(Jaeseung: Is it just because of the room arrangements)

615
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:29,060
(Jaeseung: or is there another reason? There's no way to know)

616
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:36,420
(Jaeseung: I don't know if it has anything to do with me)

617
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:43,220
(Jaeseung: My heart ached. My heart just ached for him)

618
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,340
(Hwi: Do you have lip balm?)

619
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:51,780
(Seongmin: The lip balm is over there. Beside that black thing over there)
(Seungjin: It's here)

620
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:57,460
(Hwi hasn't noticed Seongmin's state yet)

621
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,660
(Seungjin: Are you crying?)
(Seongmin: No...)

622
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,380
(Seungjin: What's wrong?)
(Seongmin: Ah...)

623
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,740
(Hwi: Why are you crying?)
(Seungjin: What's wrong? What's wrong?)

624
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,660
(Seongmin: I'm not crying)

625
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:14,260
(Hwi: What's wrong?)
(Seungjin: What's wrong? What's wrong? Lock the door)

626
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,420
(Seongmin: Don't ask)

(Jaeseung: But I don't have a first choice today)
(Hwi: Really?)

780
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:43,740
(Hwi: Who did you call yesterday?)
(Jaeseung: Will you tell me yours?)

781
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:48,820
(Hwi: I'll tell you...)

782
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:54,020
(Jaeseung: I called Seongmin yesterday)
(Hwi: I see...)

783
00:38:54,020 --> 00:39:04,940
(Jaeseung: Who did you call yesterday?)
(Hwi: I also called Seongmin)

784
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:12,060
(Unintentionally confirming the love triangle again)

785
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,780
(Ah...)

786
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:24,660
(Jaeseung: I kind of guessed it)

787
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:31,060
(Jaeseung: I knew you'd call him)
(Hwi: Why?)

788
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:39,340
(We're really a proper love triangle)

789
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:44,140
(Hwi: But I feel sorry towards you too)

790
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:47,620
(Jaeseung: Why do you feel sorry towards me?)
(Hwi: Just...)

791
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:52,060
(Jaeseung: I don't see why you should feel sorry for this)

792
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,940
(Jaeseung: I don't feel sorry towards you)

793
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:59,220
(Jaeseung: It's not about guilt)

794
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:04,340
(Jaeseung: It's emotional)

795
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:10,780
(Jaeseung: We're just being true to our feelings)
(Hwi: Right)

796
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,100
(Jaeseung: Just because someone likes him,)

797
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:19,940
(Jaeseung: it doesn't mean I can't like him anymore)

798
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:28,140
(Jaeseung: Because I like him)
(Hwi: Hmm...)

799
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,980
(Jaeseung: Just...)

800
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:39,700
(Jaeseung: Come to think of it, I made this happen)

801
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,460
(I put you two in the same room)

802
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,570
That's right.
(I put you two in the same room)

803
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,260
(I put you two in the same room)

804
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:56,780
(Jaeseung: That's how it turned out...)

805
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:00,700
(Jaeseung: I was sure Seongmin called Hwi)

806
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:04,420
(Jaeseung: If Seongmin's interested in Hwi and not me,)

807
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:10,060
(Jaeseung: there's no reason for me to stay here anymore, right?)

808
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:16,620
(How will the relationships among the three turn out?)

809
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:23,540
(It is the day of the house party)
(Youngjoon, please go to the supermarket with your roommates)

810
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,460
(Seungjin) (Yeah?)

811
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,340
(Let's go to the supermarket) (Okay)

812
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,060
(Men in charge of grocery shopping)

813
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,640
It's a roommate date today.
(Men in charge of grocery shopping)

814
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,460
(Men in charge of grocery shopping)

815
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,260
(Seungjin: Is it okay for you to drive for three days straight?)
(Youngjoon: It's not a big deal)

816
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,500
(Youngjoon: I'll try it)
(Minseon: I'll drive)

817
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,710
(Myeongkyun: Is this the car? I'll drive)

818
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,300
I'll drive.
(Myeongkyun: Is this the car? I'll drive)

819
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:41,370
(Youngjoon: I'm the host of the house party today, so I'll drive)
I'll drive.
(Myeongkyun: Is this the car? I'll drive)

820
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:43,890
(Youngjoon: I'm the host of the house party today, so I'll drive)

821
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,830
-Who's driving? -I'll drive.
(Youngjoon: I'm the host of the house party today, so I'll drive)

822
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:52,980
(Myeongkyun: Everyone was fighting(?) to be the driver)

823
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,740
(Myeongkyun: Since a good driver is cool,)

824
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:00,260
(Myeongkyun: I think we all wanted to show our charm)

825
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:07,380
Youngjoon: Let's go)
(Let's go)

826
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:07,820
-Drive safely. -The brake alert is so loud.

827
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,150
(A suspicious warning sound from the start?)
-Drive safely. -The brake alert is so loud.

828
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,380
(A suspicious warning sound from the start?)

829
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,060
(Embarrassed)
(Myeongkyun: Release the brake before driving)

830
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,980
(Myeongkyun: I'll drive. Get out of the driver's seat)

831
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,320
(Youngjoon: Be quiet! Stop talking)

832
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:17,860
Okay.
(Youngjoon: Be quiet! Stop talking)

833
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:17,920
(Minseon: I'll drive if you're tired)
Okay.
(Youngjoon: Be quiet! Stop talking)

834
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,140
(Minseon: I'll drive if you're tired)

835
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:20,520
(Endless driving disturbance(?))

836
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,350
Before I drive off the bridge.
(Endless driving disturbance(?))

837
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,590
Got it.
(Endless driving disturbance(?))

838
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,310
(Endless driving disturbance(?))

839
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:24,890
Got it?
(Endless driving disturbance(?))

840
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,100
(I feel uneasy)

841
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,900
(Shaky)
(Seungjin: It's this way...)
(Youngjoon: No...)

842
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,580
(Shaky)
(Seungjin: I think it's this way)

843
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,580
(Youngjoon: Yeah! It was like the Kartrider game just now)

844
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,180
(Myeongkyun: Not bad)

845
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,620
(Myeongkyun: His driving style is totally different from mine)

846
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:45,260
(Youngjoon: I don't have a style. I'm still a beginner)

847
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,460
(Myeongkyun: I'll drive)

848
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,820
(Myeongkyun: I'll drive when we go back)

849
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,260
(Youngjoon: Be quiet)

850
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,660
(Minseon: The road is so narrow)

851
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,100
(Youngjoon: I almost crashed into the earthern jars)

852
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,820
(Myeongkyun: Wait...)

853
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,250
(Seungjin: It's okay. I'll pay for them for you)

854
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,200
Really?
(Seungjin: It's okay. I'll pay for them for you)

855
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:04,500
(Seungjin: You should keep a calm attitude when driving to improve faster)

856
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,780
(Myeongkyun: Will you make new earthern jars?)
(Seungjin: Yes, I'll make them for him)

857
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,500
You sounded like you were gonna pay in money.
(Myeongkyun: Will you make new earthern jars?)
(Seungjin: Yes, I'll make them for him)

858
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,900
(Youngjoon: He kept talking at the backseat)

859
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,860
(Youngjoon: So I was distracted and couldn't focus on driving)

860
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:28,900
(Men's House, at the same time)

861
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,860
(Hwi: It's too lonely on the third floor)

862
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:35,220
(Hwi: And I hit my head (on the ceiling) four times today)
(Seongmin: Huh?)

863
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:39,780
(Hwi: I hit my head four times)
(Seongmin: Oh. Your head? Be careful)

864
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:48,380
(Hwi: I hit it really hard just now)
(Seongmin: Seungjin's used to it, but it's tough)

865
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,100
(Hwi: I thought I heard the ceiling collapse)

866
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:55,460
(Hwi: How is it? Your new roommate)

867
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:58,700
(Seongmin: Oh... Hanmin?)
(Hwi: Yeah)

868
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:05,660
(Seongmin: I don't think we exchanged more than 10 sentences today)
(Hwi: Really?)

869
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:11,460
(Seongmin: We didn't have a chance to talk. We didn't use to talk much)

870
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:15,220
(Seongmin: We'll probably talk later)

871
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,620
(Hwi is touching his stomach)

872
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,220
(Seongmin: Are you hungry? Didn't you say you were hungry?)

873
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,500
(Seongmin: Let's eat something)
(Hwi: I've eaten)

874
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,980
(Seongmin: Have you eaten? Why?)

875
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,510
-Let's eat. -It's nothing.
(Seongmin: Have you eaten? Why?)

876
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,260
(Seongmin: Didn't you say you were hungry?)

877
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,620
(Seongmin: Sigh... Hwi must feel so betrayed)

878
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:39,380
(Seongmin: I think Hwi already knows I assigned it)

879
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,780
(Seongmin: But I'm curious about something)

880
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:44,660
(Seongmin: Did Youngjoon and Myeongkyun fight?)

881
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:48,540
(Seongmin: Why do I feel like they're always bickering?)

882
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,180
(Hwi: Yes, I want to know too)

883
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,860
(Seongmin: Am I the only one who feels it?)
(Hwi: I feel it too)

884
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:56,620
(Seongmin: I was wondering why Youngjoon was so confrontational)

885
00:44:56,620 --> 00:45:00,380
(Hanmin: Well, in any case, Youngjoon)

886
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:04,540
(Hanmin: is burdened that they know each other)

887
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:07,420
(Seongmin: Know who? Myeongkyun? Do they know each other?)
(Hwi: He said they knew each other)

888
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:10,500
(Jaeseung: You're really slow to catch up)
(Seongmin: I didn't know. I...)

889
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,700
(Hanmin: Oh, he told us yesterday, but you must've forgotten because you were too tired)

890
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:20,060
(Jaeseung: When did you see them fighting?)

891
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:25,420
(Seongmin: After eating instant noodles this morning, we did the dishes together)

892
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:29,820
(Seongmin: They sounded like they were bickering)
(Hwi: That's right)

893
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,140
(Hanmin: Youngjoon's burdened)

894
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:37,700
(Hanmin: that they know each other to begin with)

895
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:42,460
(Hanmin: So he wants to talk it out and resolve it together,)

896
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:45,580
(Hanmin: to sort things out)

897
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,980
(Hanmin: But it didn't go well)

898
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,140
(Hanmin: His frustration kept piling up)

899
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,140
(Hanmin: Though they’ve made it clear now)

900
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:54,300
(Hanmin: But he's still frustrated)

901
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:59,140
(Hanmin: If they can have smooth conversations, it wouldn't matter)

902
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:02,140
(Hanmin: But he keeps getting slow and confusing responses)

903
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:05,900
(Hanmin: His frustration is stressing him out)

904
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,060
(Hanmin: So he unconsciously keeps having touchy responses)

905
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:11,700
(Hanmin: To be honest, he wouldn’t want to be acting that way too)

906
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,660
(Hanmin: Who'd want to seem)

907
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:18,020
(Hanmin: so touchy and aggressive in front of others?)

908
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:22,900
(Hanmin: So he gets more stress from that. It's a vicious cycle)

909
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:30,180
(Seongmin: Did they fight in the room too?)
(Hanmin: It was always like this)

910
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:38,140
(Hanmin: (Youngjoon) tries to avoid talking to him, but he keeps talking to Youngjoon)
(Seongmin: Myeongkyun?)

911
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:38,620
-So... -Oh no.
(Hanmin: (Youngjoon) tries to avoid talking to him, but he keeps talking to Youngjoon)
(Seongmin: Myeongkyun?)

912
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:39,710
-So... -Oh no.

913
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:43,580
(Hanmin: That stresses him out)

914
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:45,580
(Seongmin: But if it were me, I'd hate for people (who know me) to be here too)

915
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:48,140
(Seongmin: It'll be annoying if he knows me well)

916
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,700
(Seongmin: He might point out when I'm being fake)

917
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,200
(Hwi: That's right. "You weren't like this before")

918
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:52,980
"What's wrong with you?"
(Hwi: That's right. "You weren't like this before")

919
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:53,180
(Jaeseung: It's not about knowing each other)
"What's wrong with you?"
(Hwi: That's right. "You weren't like this before")

920
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:56,140
(Jaeseung: It's not about knowing each other)

921
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:59,780
(Jaeseung: The problem is not that they know each other)
(Seongmin: Because their personalities clash?)

922
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,180
(Jaeseung: They know each other,)

923
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:07,220
(Jaeseung: but about how they're going to tell everyone...)

924
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,500
(Seongmin: Oh, really? Didn't they tell everyone?)

925
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:14,060
(Hanmin: There was a problem about that once)
(Jaeseung: It began there)

926
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,660
(Seongmin: Oh, it began there?)

927
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,220
(Aha)

928
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:21,020
(Hwi: Gosh)
(Seongmin: Gosh. They should be able to handle it)

929
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,120
(Seongmin: I'm curious about those on the second floor)

1089
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:18,380
(Seongmin: As expected, Jaeseung is the older and wiser one)

1090
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,340
(Seongmin: He's understanding of me)

1091
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:25,540
(Seongmin: It must have really upset him,)

1092
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:31,300
(Seongmin: but he's being considerate. He's really thoughtful)

1093
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:36,060
(Seongmin: Yesterday, actually I was...)

1094
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:39,260
(Seongmin: I thought I couldn't say it the next day)
(Jaeseung: That you're sorry?)

1095
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:41,140
(Seongmin: Yeah. So I went to your room...)

1096
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,540
(Jaeseung: Don't be sorry)

1097
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:53,860
(Jaeseung: Also, it might be better that we talked about this the next day)
(Seongmin: Yeah. You're right)

1098
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:57,820
(Jaeseung: Rather than talking about it right away)

1099
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:00,700
(Jaeseung: Try not to think of it that way)

1100
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:05,100
(Jaeseung: I'll also try hard to do so)

1101
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:08,340
(Jaeseung: I want to get along with the other guys too)

1102
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:14,140
(Seongmin: There's still a lot of time)

1103
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:19,100
(Seongmin: Actually, I had a change of heart after hearing him say that)

1104
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,980
(Myeongkyun: What should we do now?)

1105
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,980
(Jaeseung: Can I help?)

1106
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,010
Wait.

1107
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:31,460
(Youngjoon: Can you take care of the vegetables behind?)

1108
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:32,630
Which vegetables?
(Youngjoon: Can you take care of the vegetables behind?)

1109
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:33,220
(Youngjoon: Can you take care of the vegetables behind?)

1110
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:37,260
(Seongmin's also looking for something to do)

1111
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,980
(Seongmin: Is it okay to cut it like this? Into halves? Should I cut it thinner?)

1112
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:45,460
(Seungjin: Should the button mushrooms be sliced thinly?)
(Youngjoon: Yes)

1113
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:46,380
(Seungjin: Slice them thinner)

1114
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:50,020
(Seongmin helps with preparing the ingredients)

1115
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,600
(Awkward)

1116
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,320
I have eight button mushrooms.
(Awkward)

1117
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,180
Eight.
(Awkward)

1118
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:54,970
(Seongmin suddenly becomes in charge of cutting the vegetables)

1119
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:56,230
Cut those too.
(Seongmin suddenly becomes in charge of cutting the vegetables)

1120
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:56,490
(Seongmin suddenly becomes in charge of cutting the vegetables)

1121
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:57,890
He said to cut those too.
(Seongmin suddenly becomes in charge of cutting the vegetables)

1122
00:55:57,890 --> 00:55:58,340
(Seongmin suddenly becomes in charge of cutting the vegetables)

1123
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:59,110
Okay.
(Seongmin suddenly becomes in charge of cutting the vegetables)

1124
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,060
(Watching him)

1125
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,300
(Youngjoon: It'd be better if you can slice them thinner)

1126
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:06,340
(Jaeseung: No, it's okay. I'll do it)

1127
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:08,660
(Youngjoon: If it's hard, cut it into half)

1128
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,520
I'll do it.
(Youngjoon: If it's hard, cut it into half)

1129
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:09,980
Cut it into half.
(Youngjoon: If it's hard, cut it into half)

1130
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:10,220
Cut it into half.

1131
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:10,600
(Jaeseung helps Seongmin, who's poor at cutting with a knife)
Cut it into half.

1132
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,300
(Jaeseung helps Seongmin, who's poor at cutting with a knife)

1133
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:12,430
Cut it into half.
(Jaeseung helps Seongmin, who's poor at cutting with a knife)

1134
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:13,770
I'm so embarrassed.
(Jaeseung helps Seongmin, who's poor at cutting with a knife)

1135
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:17,620
(Jaeseung helps Seongmin, who's poor at cutting with a knife)

1136
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:23,780
(Skillful)

1137
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,380
(Seongmin: It's honestly something that makes your heart flutter)

1138
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:31,620
(Seongmin: So I kept watching him)

1139
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:35,380
(Seongmin: He was so cool)

1140
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:40,380
(Shy)

1141
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:45,860
(Myeongkyun: It's cooking well)
(Minseon: Cooking well?)

1142
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:48,900
(Minseon: It's all squarish (?))
(Youngjoon: I'll add stuff in)

1143
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:49,860
Be careful.

1144
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:49,920
(Youngjoon: I'll add the meat when the vegetables shrink)
(Myeongkyun: Okay)
Be careful.

1145
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,020
(Youngjoon: I'll add the meat when the vegetables shrink)
(Myeongkyun: Okay)

1146
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:53,410
(T/N: "vegetables shrinking" and "hold our breaths" are the same in Korean)

1147
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,740
Let's hold our breaths.
(T/N: "vegetables shrinking" and "hold our breaths" are the same in Korean)

1148
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:57,340
(T/N: "vegetables shrinking" and "hold our breaths" are the same in Korean)

1149
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:02,500
(Hold our breaths, haha)
(Youngjoon: Can you unpack the asparagus for me?)

1150
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:02,680
(What?) (Minseon?)

1151
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,340
-I'm talking to you. -Really?
(What?) (Minseon?)

1152
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,420
(Minseon: The asparagus?)
(Youngjoon: Yes)

1153
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,300
(Youngjoon: Please help me with that)
(Minseon: Okay. Thank you)

1154
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,300
(Youngjoon: I'm sorry)
(Minseon: It's okay)

1155
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:14,300
(Finding it funny)

1156
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:20,100
(Under Youngjoon's lead, they all help prepare dinner)

1157
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:21,660
(Gulp)

1158
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,740
(Let's go to the entertainment room)

1159
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:30,320
(Tada)

1160
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:30,700
Tada.
(Tada)

1161
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:31,290
Tada.

1162
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:35,580
(Youngjoon: Put everything on the white table)
(Seongmin: Okay. Outside?)

1163
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:36,900
(Youngjoon: Place them nicely)
(Seongmin: Okay)

1164
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:40,900
(Hwi: Can everything fit?)
(Youngjoon: I'll arrange them. Just leave them on the table)

1165
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:43,220
(Youngjoon: Get the cutlery too)
(Seongmin: It's so pretty)

1166
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:46,300
(Youngjoon: Let's leave these on the tray here)
(Jaeseung: It looks delicious)

1167
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:47,980
It's amazing.

1168
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:48,350
(Sangria and dishes filled with the eight men's style)
It's amazing.

1169
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:48,770
(Sangria and dishes filled with the eight men's style)

1170
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:49,790
Amazing.
(Sangria and dishes filled with the eight men's style)

1171
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:50,870
Is it the last dinner?
(Sangria and dishes filled with the eight men's style)

1172
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:52,400
It feels like we're abroad.
(Sangria and dishes filled with the eight men's style)

1173
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,020
(Hanmin: As they say, a man who can cook is sexy)

1174
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:59,620
(Hanmin: Actually, I'm not good at cooking)

1175
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:02,340
(Hanmin: To be honest, (Youngjoon) was cool)

1176
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:05,060
(Hwi: It looks so well made)
(Jaeseung: It looks delicious)

1177
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:07,580
(Hwi: Great)
(Jaeseung: Let's take one each)

1178
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:08,940
(Youngjoon: Shall we have a toast with the Sangria?)

1179
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,250
(Youngjoon: Let's have a toast)

1180

1182
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:11,780
(Seongmin: Cheers?)

1183
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,040
Cheers.

1184
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:17,460
(Youngjoon: Let's have a good time at this house party. For the rest of the time, let's...)

1185
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,850
(Youngjoon: How should I put it?)

1186
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:19,380
-Get along. -Get along.

(Drinking the Sangria they made together)

1194
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:31,690

Mine is a bit light too.
(Frowning)

1200

(Hwi: But I want to give it secretly)

1215
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:19,020
(Hwi: I want to try that)

(Hwi: He'll really like it)

1218
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:33,780
(Hwi: I'll start preparing the ribbon now)

1219

(Hanmin: Right. Should we have taken photos of the dishes you cooked?)

1220
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:40,100
Right.
(Hanmin: Right. Should we have taken photos of the dishes you cooked?)

(Youngjoon: I don't have my phone now)

1225
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:47,740
(Youngjoon: Because it's all messed up)

1226
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:51,500
(Youngjoon: We should've taken photos)
(Seongmin: Oh, right)

1227
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,220
(Youngjoon: I brought the camera to take photos before it's all messed up)

01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:31,980
(Hanmin: I'll rank them straight then)
(Minseon: Yeah, for fun)

1396
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:33,860
(Hanmin: Based on my standard)

1397
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:37,980
(Myeongkyun: Me? Of course I'm first)

1398
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:42,820
(Hwi: The first place is Seongmin and I'll be next)

1399
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:46,860
(#1 Youngjoon) (#2 Jaeseung) (#3 Hanmin)

1400
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:49,860
(#1 Youngjoon) (#2 Jaeseung) (#3 Hanmin)
(#4 Hwi) (#5 Seongmin)

1401
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,660
(Thinking)

1402
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:55,460
(Based on Hanmin's standards, who's the 6th to 8th places in Men's House?)

1403
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:56,860
I'm doomed.

1404
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:57,740
Just finish it.

1405
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:57,870
(#6 Myeongkyun) (#7 Seungjin) (#8 Minseon)
Just finish it.

1406
01:07:57,870 --> 01:07:59,010
(#6 Myeongkyun) (#7 Seungjin) (#8 Minseon)

1407
01:07:59,010 --> 01:07:59,250
Okay.
(#6 Myeongkyun) (#7 Seungjin) (#8 Minseon)

1408
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:00,320
Okay, go on.
(#6 Myeongkyun) (#7 Seungjin) (#8 Minseon)

1409
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:03,580
(Seongmin: I was annoyed that I was in 5th place)

1410
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,540
(Seongmin: 5th place?)

1411
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:09,460
(Seongmin: No, I'm the first place)

1412
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:13,620
(Hanmin: I feel bad, but I had no choice)

1413
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,640
(Phew)

1414
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:17,939
Two consecutive questions.
(Phew)

1415
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:18,819
Two consecutive questions.

1416
01:08:18,819 --> 01:08:20,859
(Question for all)
(If you can see your lover's past, would you?)

1417
01:08:20,859 --> 01:08:25,060
(If you can see your lover's past, would you?)

1418
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:27,300
(Seungjin: What?)
(Hwi: Would you see your lover's past?)

1419
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,090
-What? The past? -Yeah.

1420
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:32,100
(Minseon: To be honest, I don't want to hear about their past)

1421
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:37,060
(Minseon: I think if I know their past, it might be harmful to me)

1422
01:08:37,939 --> 01:08:40,740
(Hanmin: I don't want to see it)

1423
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:44,300
(Hanmin: Anyway, seeing it will only make me more troubled)

1424
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:48,859
(Hanmin: What’s important is our relationship in the future)

1425
01:08:48,859 --> 01:08:51,500
(Hanmin: So I won't see (my lover's))

1426
01:08:51,819 --> 01:08:52,979
(Clapping, haha)

1427
01:08:52,979 --> 01:08:54,010
Draw another one.
(Clapping, haha)

1428
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:59,779
(Hanmin: Fortunately, it's for Seongmin)

1429
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,100
(To Seongmin)
(How many people are you concerned about?)

1430
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:05,300
-It's a similar question. -Someone you're concerned about?
(To Seongmin)
(How many people are you concerned about?)

1431
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,500
-It's a similar question. -Someone you're concerned about?

1432
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:10,979
(Jaeseung: What I really want to ask is)

1433
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:15,779
(Jaeseung: why he didn't call me yesterday)

1434
01:09:15,779 --> 01:09:23,660
(Jaeseung: Even if it's anonymous, it might become that I asked it)

1435
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:28,700
(Jaeseung: So I asked him how many people he's concerned about now)

1436
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:32,330
(Seongmin: I'm concerned about three people.

1437
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:33,310
-Three. -Three?
(Seongmin: I'm concerned about three people.

1438
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:35,060
-Three. -Three?

1439
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:35,899
(Oh...)
-Three. -Three?

1440
01:09:35,899 --> 01:09:37,660
(Oh...)

1441
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:43,939
(Hwi: First, there's Jaeseung. I don't know the other one)

1442
01:09:43,939 --> 01:09:45,899
(Hwi: I was flustered)

1443
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:46,260
I'll continue.

1444
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:47,040
(Next question~)
I'll continue.

1445
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:50,100
(Next question~)

1446
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:51,470
What's that?

1447
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:59,620
(To Hwi)
(How many people are you interested in?)

1448
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:07,900
(Hwi: Maybe Jaeseung is trying to figure out if I'm interested in anyone else)

1449
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:11,100
(Hwi: Now?)

1450
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,760
(Hwi: For me... one person)

1451
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:13,790
One person?
(Hwi: For me... one person)

1452
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:15,620
(Hwi: For me... one person)

1453
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:18,460
(Seongmin's anonymous question for Hwi)

1454
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:23,900
(Seongmin: I think he's talking about me. I was touched)

1455
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:26,980
(Youngjoon: Don't look. Just draw one)
(Minseon: Close your eyes and draw one)

1456
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:28,120
(Hwi: For Myeongkyun)

1457
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:29,280
Gosh. What is it?
(Hwi: For Myeongkyun)

1458
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:33,540
(To Myeongkyun)
(What do you want to hear from and say to the one you're interested in?)

1459
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:36,140
(I don't like cheesy words~)

1460
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:37,820
(Minseon: It may be a little cheesy,)

1461
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:41,060
(Minseon: but that's why I'm asking)

1462
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:46,100
(Minseon: What I'm most curious about is how they express themselves)

1463
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:50,860
(Myeongkyun: I think it's enough (to hear) something like "I like you")

1464
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:51,940
(Shy)

1465
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:54,340
(Myeongkyun: What I want to say is also something like "I like you")

1466
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:56,460
(Nodding)

1467
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,620
(Draw the next one)

1468
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:03,540
(Myeongkyun: Oh, here's a big one)

1469
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:10,500
(Question for all)
(Avoidant lover who doesn't explain why he's angry VS. Hot-tempered lover who complains about every detail)

1470
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,580
It's two extremes.
(Question for all)
(Avoidant lover who doesn't explain why he's angry VS. Hot-tempered lover who complains about every detail)

1471
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:12,100
(Question for all)
(Avoidant lover who doesn't explain why he's angry VS. Hot-tempered lover who complains about every detail)

1472
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:16,100
(Minseon: It's so hard to choose)
(Hanmin: It's crazy hard to choose)

1473
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:17,080
(Avoidant type VS. Hot tempered type)

1474
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,380
Really.
(Avoidant type VS. Hot tempered type)

1475
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:20,540
It's easy for me to choose.
(Avoidant type VS. Hot tempered type)

1476
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:22,090
But I...
(Avoidant type VS. Hot tempered type)

1477
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:27,660
(Myeongkyun: The avoidant type makes me angry because I'm frustrated)

1478
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:30,550
(Myeongkyun: I'd rather have a hot-tempered lover who gets angry a lot)

1479
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:31,380
You'd prefer the hot-tempered type?
(Myeongkyun: I'd rather have a hot-tempered lover who gets angry a lot)

1480
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:31,530
(Youngjoon: I prefer the hot-tempered type too)
You'd prefer the hot-tempered type?
(Myeongkyun: I'd rather have a hot-tempered lover who gets angry a lot)

1481
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:33,100
(Youngjoon: I prefer the hot-tempered type too)

1482
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:35,980
(Youngjoon: I've been hurt by the avoidant type many times)

1483
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:39,180
(Youngjoon: Even if we quarrel, I'd still find out the reason)

1484
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:44,900
(Youngjoon: Nothing can be done with the avoidant type)

1485
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:48,180
(Youngjoon: I think they're just inconsiderate)

1486
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:50,220
(Seongmin: I agree)

1487
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:53,500
(Myeongkyun: That left me speechless)

1488
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,420
(Myeongkyun: He said we ended things in peace)

1489
01:11:56,420 --> 01:12:00,860
(Myeongkyun: But one day, he just one-sidedly stopped contacting me)

1490
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:04,020
(Myeongkyun: And he didn't say that he didn't like me or wasn't interested in me anymore)

1491
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:05,980
(Myeongkyun: He just shirked the responsibility to me)

1492
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:11,260
(Seongmin: This is fun)

1493
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:15,140
(Myeongkyun: I hope you pick your own (question))

1494
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:17,000
(Youngjoon: Oh! It's really for me!)

1495
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,290
-It's for him. -Really?
(Youngjoon: Oh! It's really for me!)

1496
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:19,170
It's for me.
(Youngjoon: Oh! It's really for me!)

1497
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:20,060
(Youngjoon's face hardens after reading the question)

1498
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:21,150
My wish came true.
(Youngjoon's face hardens after reading the question)

1499
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:24,420
(Youngjoon's face hardens after reading the question)

1500
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:29,580
(To Youngjoon)
(I don't think you're being sincere. Can't you be more honest?)

1501
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:32,340
(Myeongkyun's question for Youngjoon that leaves him flustered)

1502
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:34,580
(Minseon: What does that mean?)

1503
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:37,420
(Seongmin: He asked so directly?)

1504
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,580
(Hanmin: Is this a question?)

1505
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:44,940
(Hanmin: Wow. So straightforwardly?)

1506
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:48,860
(Hanmin: Is this a question or an attack?)

1507
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:51,460
(Hanmin: To be honest, that was my first thought)

1508
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:58,860
(Youngjoon: I think only Myeongkyun would say something like that to me)

1509
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:01,460
(Youngjoon: I'll answer you)

1510
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:04,540
(Youngjoon: Since I came here, I've never)

1511
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:07,980
(Youngjoon: been fake or hid anything)

1512
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:09,380
(Youngjoon: Right, there's one thing)

1513
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:12,740
(Youngjoon: When I acted like I didn't know Myeongkyun when I first saw him)

1514
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:15,220
(Youngjoon: Other than that, I swear)

1515
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:17,740
(Youngjoon: I've never lied or been fake)

1516
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:20,660
(Youngjoon: After getting that question,)

1517
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:27,020
(Youngjoon: I felt strongly that (Myeongkyun) still likes me)

1518
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:28,540
(Youngjoon: What's wrong with him?)

1519
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:32,460
(Youngjoon: Is he wary that I'm getting close with Hanmin?)

1520
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:35,580
(Myeongkyun: He's just not like his usual self)

1521
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:37,160
(Atmosphere getting heavier...)

1522
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,140
Now...
(Atmosphere getting heavier...)

1523
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:39,080
Draw one.
(Atmosphere getting heavier...)

1524
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:42,060
(Atmosphere getting heavier...)

1525
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:45,950
(Flustered)

1526
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:46,460
Did you get a good one?
(Flustered)

1527
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:46,980
Did you get a good one?

1528
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:48,460
(Seongmin: Wait)

1529
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:49,880
(Seongmin: But this question is...)

1530
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:50,620
What's wrong?
(Seongmin: But this question is...)

1531
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:50,720
(An anonymous question for Jaeseung)
What's wrong?
(Seongmin: But this question is...)

1532
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:51,890
(An anonymous question for Jaeseung)

1533
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:53,100
Jaeseung. Oh.
(An anonymous question for Jaeseung)

1534
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:54,100
(An anonymous question for Jaeseung)

1535
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:54,340
-What's wrong? -What's wrong?

1536
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:56,160
(Curious)
-What's wrong? -What's wrong?

1537
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:56,360
Read it.
(Curious)

1538
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:57,460
-What is it? -You read it.
(Curious)

1539
01:13:57,460 --> 01:13:57,640
(Seongmin: I can't read this)
(Youngjoon: Okay)
-What is it? -You read it.
(Curious)

1540
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:00,620
(Seongmin: I can't read this)
(Youngjoon: Okay)

1541
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:02,560
(Youngjoon: I'll read it)

1542
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,850
To Jaeseung.
(Youngjoon: I'll read it)

1543
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:09,660
(To Jaeseung)
(Are you sure about your feelings for Seongmin?)

1544
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:11,540
(Wow)

1545
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:15,420
(Youngjoon: A fierce one)

1546
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:20,380
(Jaeseung: They were questions focused on Seongmin)

1547
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:26,460
(Jaeseung: All the questions made everyone flustered)

1548
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:29,940
(Jaeseung: But this is a bit cruel)

1549
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:30,350
(Youngjoon: It's fun)

1550
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:32,350
It's fun watching others' drama.
(Youngjoon: It's fun)

1551
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:33,100
(Youngjoon: It's fun)

1552
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:35,180
(Myeongkyun: The looks-ranking question just now was nothing)

1553
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:39,860
(Jaeseung: This is giving me a headache)

1554
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:44,380
(Jaeseung: Give me some time to think. Wait)

1555
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:50,060
(Because of an unexpected question, Jaeseung is flustered)

1556
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:54,740
(Jaeseung: I'm guessing Hwi wrote it)

1557
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:58,580
(Seungjin: On the note,)

1558
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:05,340
(Seungjin: I asked if he was sure about his feelings for Seongmin)

1559
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:13,860
(To Cha Jaeseung)
(Are you sure about your feelings for Seongmin?)
(From Kim Seungjin)

1560
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:16,740
(Jaeseung mistakes Seungjin's question as Hwi's)

1561
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:18,070
I'm not sure.
(Jaeseung mistakes Seungjin's question as Hwi's)

1562
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:19,020
(Jaeseung mistakes Seungjin's question as Hwi's)

1563
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:24,260
(Seongmin: I'm disappointed when he said he wasn't sure)

1564
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:30,820
(Hwi: He said he wasn't sure, so I felt relieved)

1565
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:35,900
(Seungjin: I thought he'd say yes without thinking)

1566
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:38,060
(Seungjin: But he said he wasn't sure)

1567
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:39,380
(Seungjin: So I thought, I see)

1568
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:43,580
(Seungjin: What is that? What is he thinking?)

1569
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:47,980
(To Seungjin)
(How have you expressed your feelings to someone you liked?)

1570
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:51,380
(Hmm...)

1571
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:55,180
(Youngjoon is the one asking about Seungjin this)

1572
01:15:56,420 --> 01:16:01,100
(Seungjin: I become more awkward around the one I like)

1573
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:05,980
(Seungjin: I don't want him to find out my feelings, so I think I tease him quite a bit)

1574
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:11,060
(Youngjoon: Here? To someone here?)
(Seungjin: Yes)

1575
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:15,660
(Hwi draws the next question)

1576
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:18,510
(Hwi: Do I answer the question for everyone?)

1577
01:16:18,510 --> 01:16:19,680
What is it?
(Hwi: Do I answer the question for everyone?)

1578
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:24,820
(Question for all)
(After coming to Men's House, when were you the most jealous?)

1579
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:30,100
(Curious) (Interested)

1580
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:33,980
(Seungjin: Let's be honest)

1581
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:43,020
(Hwi: Um... Last night, when Jaeseung took Seongmin out)

1582
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:49,660
(Hwi was most jealous when Jaeseung and Seongmin went on their secret date)

1583
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:52,400
(Embarrassed)

1584
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,330
Draw one.
(Embarrassed)

1585
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:53,900
-Hurry up and draw one. -Hurry up.

1586
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:56,210
(The men want to relieve this awkward situation with the next question)

(Hanmin: It must feel embarrassing...)

1589
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:04,040
(Hwi: Oh? Question for Hanmin)

1590
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,130
Okay.
(Hwi: Oh? Question for Hanmin)

1591
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:10,540
(To Hanmin)
(Besides the one you're openly interested in, is there anyone else you're interested in?)

1592
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:13,460
(Hanmin: Not yet)

1593
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:19,860
(Smiling)

1594
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:27,060
(Seongmin: What does that mean?)
(Hwi: Besides the one he's openly interested in, is there anyone else he's interested in?)

1595
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:30,900
(Seongmin: It felt like he was announcing that he's only interested in Youngjoon)

1596
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:32,740
(Seongmin: So I sort of gave up on Hanmin)

1597
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:35,460
(Seongmin: Since he's not open to other possibilities)

1598
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:39,060
(Seongmin: So I'm less interested in him)

1599
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:40,190
(Minseon is next to draw the questions)

1600
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:41,310
Very nice.

For Seongmin.
(Minseon is next to draw the questions)

1603
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:48,900
What is it?

1604
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:53,260
(To Seongmin)
(Hyung, when you're troubled, what kind of person do you want beside you?)
(T/N: "hyung" is how a younger person addresses an older male)

1605

(Seongmin: Me? When I'm troubled?)

1610
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:12,280
(Seongmin: Well... I think it's best if it's someone who stays by your side)

1611
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,410
That's what I think.

(Seongmin: I thought about Hwi at that time)

1614
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:21,580
(Hwi: I felt like my questions were obvious)

1615

1617
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:29,100
(Hwi: I screwed up. I wrote it wrong)

1618
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:31,300
(Hwi: I thought I made a mistake)

1619
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:32,380
(Minseon: Oh? There's one more)

1620
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:34,010
Another one?

1621
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:35,180
Gosh.

1622
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:35,300

(Jaeseung: Finally)

1632
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:58,580
(Jaeseung: Because no secret can be kept forever)

1633
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:03,100
(Seongmin: I was shocked. I hope they won't be revealed)

will get to make one more call.
