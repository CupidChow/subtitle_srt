(Jaeseung: Have you been on a blind date like this before?
Seongmin: A blind date?)

309
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,050
(Seongmin: This is my first time.)

310
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,120
(Jaeseung: It's my first blind date too.)

311
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,170
(Jaeseung: It's a complete mystery to me)

312
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,230
Yes.
(Jaeseung: It's a complete mystery to me)

313
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,830
(Jaeseung: As I opened it,)

314
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:43,850
-it felt like I was opening a gift box.

-That's right.

317
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,920
(It felt like I was opening a gift box.)

318
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:56,490
(Seongmin: But it's still nice to meet the person at first.
Jaeseung: I agree.)

319
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:02,670
(Jaeseung: I'll definitely remember your name.
Seongmin: I will definitely.)

320
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,010
(Jaeseung: What's your ideal type?)

321
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,850
(Seongmin: My ideal type... is someone taller than me.)

322
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,010
(Seongmin: Someone I can trust.
Jaeseung: Someone you can trust.)

323
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,540
(Seongmin: Someone I can communicate well with.)

324
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,190
(Jaeseung: So for appearance, just someone taller than you?)

325
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,280
(Seongmin: Yes. I hope he's taller than me.)

326
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,910
(Seongmin: What's your ideal type?)

327
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,550
For me...
(Seongmin: What's your ideal type?)

328
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,470
(Jaeseung: I haven't decided on my ideal type.)

329
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,030
(Jaeseung: But I like eyes without double eyelids.)

330
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,930
(Seongmin: You like people with single eyelids.
Jaeseung: Yes.)

331
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:35,450
And someone with a nice nose.

Seongmin: Someone with a nice nose.)

334
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,670
(Jaeseung: When I look at people with nice noses, I'm envious.)

335
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,120
(Jaeseung: So I like people with nice noses.)

336
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,380
(Seongmin: What's wrong with your nose? Your nose is pretty though?)

337
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,360
But I...
(Seongmin: What's wrong with your nose? Your nose is pretty though?)

338
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,240
(Shy)

339
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,820
Can we not talk about it?
(Shy)

340
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,620
Okay, okay. We don't have to talk about it.
(Shy)

341
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,150
Okay, okay. We don't have to talk about it.

342
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,230
(Seongmin: But, can I ask again, what's your name?)

343
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,380

349
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:10,150
(Seongmin: I was too nervous. When we first talked,)

350
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:15,210
(Seongmin: I don't even remember what I talked about. Things didn't connect.)

351
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,800
(Seungmin: Do you have any hobbies?
Jaeseung: I like lifting weights.)

Seongmin: Swimming is so cool.)

357
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,230
(Jaeseung: What's your hobby?)

358
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,660

361
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,120
(Seongmin: Isn't it cool that they have such a distinct style?
Jaeseung: That's true.)

362
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,000
(Jaeseung: Because there's a charm to it.
Seongmin: That's right.)

363
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,420
(Jaeseung: Do you have a distinct style?

(Jaeseung: This is fun.)

367
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,100
(Jaeseung: Unlike what we worried about, we are getting along well.)

368
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,030
Really?

369
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,590
(Jaeseung: Unlike what we worried about, we are getting along well.)

370
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,400
(Seongmin: Did you think we wouldn't communicate well?)

371
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,130
(Jaeseung: After all, for blind dates,)

372
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,790
(Jaeseung: it puts people in a difficult spot.)

373
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:15,320
(Jaeseung: But we are communicating better than I expected.
Seongmin: That's right.)

374
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,890
(Seongmin: I thought it would be awkward.)

375
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,230
(Seongmin: But it's much easier than I thought.)

376
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,240
(Seongmin: We can feel all sorts of complex feelings now, right?)

-All the emotions.
-Happiness is part of it too.

381
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,510
Because there is some anticipation.

382
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:38,200
(The first meeting with all sorts of emotions)

383
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:44,690

(Youngjoon: Do you have any hobbies?
Seungjin: Me?)

388
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:55,580
-I don't really like to move.
-Is that so?

00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,500
(Seungjin: I don't really like to move.)

391
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:03,920
(Seungjin: I went fishing a while ago. I found it pretty nice.)

392
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,610
(Seungjin: Cause I liked looking at the water.)

393
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,270
(Hwi: I find fishing boring...
Youngjoon: Have you tried it before?)

Youngjoon: I only did fishing once. When I was young.)

396
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,110
(Seungjin: I like doing boring things.)

397
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:24,650
(Youngjoon: I can see there are a lot of differences.)

398
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,430
(Youngjoon: It felt new.)

399
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,880
For example, I'll stay home alone and watch the ceiling.

400
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,970
(Seungjin: I'll stay home alone and watch the ceiling.)

405
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:46,330
(On the other hand,
another man who arrives at the date venue)

406
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,470
(I'm nervous and excited.)

407
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:55,130
(I'm worried too, and have mixed feelings.)

408
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,660
-The background music.
-Someone's here.

409
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,350

(The fourth man shows up unexpectedly)

419
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,040
(Minseon: To be honest, I didn't expect there would be three of them there.)

420
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,390
(Minseon: I just kept a poker face.)

421
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,720
(Minseon: If I look surprised, they'll be flustered too.)

422
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:22,880
(Minseon: Let's walk in as cheerfully as possible. That's what I thought back then.)

423
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,050
(Youngjoon: I never thought it would be a meeting of four)

424
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,790
(Youngjoon: for our first meeting.)

425
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,060
(Hwi: I've never been on a blind date.)

426
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,660
(Hwi: Four people meeting at the same time is beyond my imagination.)

427
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,320
(Seungjin: What kind of combination is this?)

428
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,010

465
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:10,490
(Minseon: So I thought I seem to fit this part very well.)

466
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:16,800
(Hwi: I don't really care about appearance.)

467
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,490
(Hwi: If I have to choose, like you said,)

468
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:26,680
(Hwi: either a punk vibe, or someone who's reliable.)

469
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,060
(Youngjoon: That's so different, punk? A gangster and someone who's reliable.)

470
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,630
There's no fixed requirement.

You can't copy me.
(Kidding)
(Youngjoon: You can't copy me.)

477
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,850
But that's my original type...

478
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,510
(Kidding)

00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,440
Why are you copying my answer.

480
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,880

(Youngjoon: Do I look mature?)

486
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:08,330
(Hwi: Among the four, Youngjoon is the closest to my ideal type.)

487
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,300
(Minseon: It's going in this way, right?)

488
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,560
Clockwise direction.

502
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,980
(Seungjin: That tires me out. Just other than that, it's fine.)

503
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:47,990

(Youngjoon: You can't lie even if it's for my sake.)

510
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,790
(Minseon: Like a white lie
Youngjoon: Yeah. That won't do either.

511
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:15,060
(Youngjoon: Because even so, it's a lie after all.)

512
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,370
(Youngjoon: No matter the intention, it's still deceiving me.)

513
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:21,370
(Hwi: I usually accept white lies.)

514
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:26,400

(Minseon: there's small talks here and there,)

521
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,630

Seongmin: It's like a takeout that costs 32,000 won for a bowl.

1197
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:02,430
I would order it.
Seongmin: It's like a takeout that costs 32,000 won for a bowl.

1198

(Everyone is satisfied with Youngjoon's cooking)

1202
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:10,600
Seongmin: You can confidently tell others that you can cook.

1203
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,030
Youngjoon: It's not that I'm confident, I just enjoy cooking.

1204
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:16,860
Youngjoon: I like cooking for my friends.

1205
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:20,340

1206
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:21,240
Yeah.
Seongmin: When you cook for your friends, it makes you happy when they enjoy the food, right?

1208
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,660

ENFJ.

You guessed all wrong earlier, but you got it right this time.

Youngjoon: Then out of the six of us, I'm the only J?

1215
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:40,620
Youngjoon: And only Seungjin is I?

1216
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,740
Seungjin: Am I the only I? -What are you?

Seungjin: This is bad...

1224
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:55,050
Seungjin: How is it that there are six of us,

1225
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:58,680
Seungjin: but I'm the only introvert?

1226
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,250
Jaeseung: Are you really all NF?

1227
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:05,320
(Minseon suddenly leaves his seat)

1228
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,090

Minseon: I feel like I care,

1244
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,640
Minseon: But I'm not sure if it's an attachment.

1245
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,850
It's E, right? Or is it I?

1246
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:35,800
E.

1247
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,730
There's only one I.

(Hwi and Jaeseung)

1252

'Isn't there something going on between them?' Was what I thought.

1253
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:48,430
Seongmin: Just a hunch?

1254
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,160
Jaeseung: Since we're done, let's clean up.

1255

-Jaeseung: I feel like it's important to get familiar with the faces first. -Seongmin: Right.

1271
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:27,890

1279
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:47,290
Hwi: and I saw Jaeseung and Seongmin cleaning together

1280
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:48,690
Hwi: and thought that the atmosphere was great

1281
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:53,550
Hwi: so I was a little sad.

1282
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,510
Youngjoon: Did someone write my name wrong?

1283
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:56,880
Youngjoon: Why did it become like this?

1284
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,280
-Right. -Who wrote it?

What? So they made their signs pretty,

1294
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,750
and just roughly made ours?

00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:44,560
I noticed that...
(Jaeseung chose Minseon as the oldest)

1510
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:48,290
(Jaeseung: Even if no one asked,)

1511
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:48,890
He's always the first to step up and help. -Right.
(Jaeseung: Even if no one asked,)

1514
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,110
(Applauding)
So I saw his kindness.

1515
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:56,600
So I think that's why I think he's older.
(Applauding)

1516
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,540
(Applauding)
So I think that's why I think he's older.

Minseon: I'm so curious about everyone's age.

I really want to know.
Minseon: I'm so curious about everyone's age.

1520
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,160
Youngjoon: Everyone looks young.

1521
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,390
Minseon: Yeah, everyone looks young.

1522
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:07,390
(Minseon: I've always heard other's say that about me,)

1523
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:10,920
(Minseon: so I'm not upset.)

1524
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:14,000
(Minseon: I kind of just thought "that's right".)

1525
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,480
(Minseon: I've already accepted it.)

1526
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:17,240
I want to ask something interesting.

1527
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,980

01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:28,590
(Youngjoon: If I'm in a double room,)

1533
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:30,610
aside from those who are my roommates,

1534
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:30,850
who would want to be my roommate?

1535

(Jaeseung and Minseon chose each other)
I got two votes, right?

1551
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:07,390

Jaeseung: I feel like we'll get along well.

1554
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:14,370
Should I change rooms with you?

1555
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:16,670
You can't change your roommate.
Should I change rooms with you?

1556
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:17,150
Should I change rooms with you?

1557

(Minseon: The person I want to be roommates with

1559
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:26,570
said we "get along" so I'm happy.)

1560
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:29,420
(Jaeseung: Instead of sharing a room with someone I like,

1561
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:36,500
I prefer living with someone I get along well with.)

1562
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:38,370
What about you?

1563
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:39,440
(Quietly)

Really?

(Youngjoon: That makes me happy. Really happy.)

1572
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,440
Youngjoon: I also chose Seongmin.

1573
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:59,300
Youngjoon: When we first met and were chatting on the sofa

1574
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:02,940
he made me feel relaxed.

1575
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:07,000
He's also a great listener so I'm really grateful.

1576
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:11,110
I felt like we can get along well.

1577
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:11,520
It's Seongmin's turn to ask.

1578
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,480
The last question.
It's Seongmin's turn to ask.

1579
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,480
-The last question? -Yes, last one.
The last question.

1580
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:21,120
Q. Who do you think will receive the most calls today?

1581
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:21,420
The one who will get the most calls?

One.

1589
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,730
One. One.

1590

I think he'll be popular.

1603
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:07,470

Go jump in the water and come back later.

1608
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,160
I wanted to say that, too.
Go jump in the water and come back later.

1609
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:24,540
Hwi: So the reason...

1610
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:26,580
Minseon: I think many people

1611
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:30,770
agree it's comfortable to be with Youngjoon.

1612
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:33,620
Don't call me because you feel comfortable. Don't make me misunderstand.

1613
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:39,780
Jaeseung: I chose Hwi

1614
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:42,150
because of his eye smile?

1615
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:44,300
I think that left a strong impression on me.

1616
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:47,450

because I'm interested in them so I've been observing.

1619

(The men heading to their own space)

1669
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:15,290
Hwi: Where... What are we supposed to do?

1670
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:15,620
What did you get?
Hwi: Where... What are we supposed to do?

1671
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,540
Hwi: What is the message?
What did you get?

1672
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:17,380
Hwi: What is the message?

1673
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,510
Seongmin: It's time to call.

1674
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:20,270
What should I do?
Seongmin: It's time to call.

1675
01:05:20,270 --> 01:05:20,940
What should I do?

1676
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:25,530
(The men's first call time)

1677
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:35,710
To whom are their affections going to? (The first night: Where are the men's hearts heading towards?)

1678
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:37,590
(Second-floor single room, Jaeseung's room)

1679
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:42,840
I feel anxious and excited.
(Second-floor single room, Jaeseung's room)

1680
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:47,650
Jaeseung: I also have expectations. It's a complicated feeling.

(Third-floor single room, Seungjin's room)

1682
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:54,800

(Second-floor double room, Youngjoon & Minseon's room)

1685
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:05,560
I haven't...

1686
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,040
Youngjoon: Have you decided?

1687
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,550
(Shaking his head)

1688
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:13,620
Minseon: What should I do?

1689
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:17,530
Minseon: I should have had a drink earlier.

1690
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:19,640
(Minseon: Maybe I could have chosen faster that way.)

1691
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,470
-Youngjoon: The power of alcohol. -Minseon: Yes, with the power of alcohol.

1692
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:22,560
Youngjoon: I don't even have that kind of power.

1693
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:31,430
-(Minseon: If I face everything sober...)
-(Youngjoon: Even if I drink, my head is clear and my body just feels sick.)

1694
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,510
(Youngjoon: Should I go somewhere else?)

1695
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:43,090
-Minseon: How? -Youngjoon: Privately.

1696
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:45,560
Minseon: Where are you going?

1697
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:50,000
-Youngjoon: Somewhere I can be alone. -Minseon: Really?

1698
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:53,820
(If Youngjoon stays with Minseon)
If we're together...

1699
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:56,050
(Youngjoon: I'm afraid that Minseon might call me,)

1700
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:58,480
(Youngjoon: but then I won't call him,)

1701
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,130
(Youngjoon: then it'll be really awkward,)

1702
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:03,940
Youngjoon: so I left the room.

1703
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:10,220
(In case something awkward happens, Youngjoon searches for a private space.)

1704
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:13,110
Seongmin: Do you want to take a picture? Even though you look really tired.

1705
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:13,240
Can I?
Seongmin: Do you want to take a picture? Even though you look really tired.

1706
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,030
Can I?

1707
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,670
-Are you okay? -Yes.

Let's show our tension.
(Seongmin: Let's take one more to show how worried we are)

(#Tension(?)_filled_two-shot_JPG)

1722
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:36,840
Hwi: Do you like diffusers?

1723
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,680
-Seongmin: This isn't mine. -Hwi: Oh, really?

1724
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,110
-Seongmin: It was originally here. -Hwi: Oh so it was here in the first place.

1725
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:43,850
-Hwi: I was going to say so earlier but I really like diffusers. -Seongmin: Really?

1726
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:46,920
-Seongmin: You like fragrance. -Hwi: Yes, I like it when it smells nice.

1727
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:49,380
Hwi: What kind of perfume do you like the most?

1728
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:50,600
Seongmin: Lately...

1729
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:54,950
(Seongmin: I used to like woody scents,)

1730
01:07:54,950 --> 01:08:00,420
Seongmin: but lately I like fresh and sweet scents.

1731
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:02,230
Seongmin: Like the smell of a temple.

1732
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:03,570
Seongmin: The fresh smell of a temple in summer.

1733
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:06,480
-Hwi: Temples smell really nice. -Seongmin: Yes, I like that.

1734

Seongmin: I like fresh summer scents.

1735
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,090
Seongmin: What songs do you like?

1736
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:17,870
Hwi: I'm not picky about the genre. I like them all.

1737
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:20,290
-Seongmin: Really? -Hwi: I like Jannabi.

1738

01:08:24,859 --> 01:08:27,590
Awesome!

01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:29,689
-Seongmin: I really like the distinct characteristics of Jannabi. -Hwi: Really?

1742
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:32,660
Seongmin: From beginning to end, Jannabi

1743
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:33,979
Seongmin: maintains the same emotions when releasing an album.

1744
01:08:33,979 --> 01:08:34,760
That's right.
Seongmin: maintains the same emotions when releasing an album.

1745
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:37,240
Seongmin: I really respect that. It's so cool,

1746
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,899
Seongmin: people who have strong emotions.

1747

-Hwi: Every song is great. -Seongmin: That's right.

Seongmin: When I'm talking to someone

1749
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:49,170
Seongmin: it's rare for me to feel comfortable.

1750
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:54,160
Seongmin: But with Hwi, I think we get along well.

1751

(The first person on the phone)

1752

(Minseon, the first man, leaving calmly)

1754
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:28,970
Minseon: What I thought about before heading out to call was to,

1755
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:30,520
“face it honestly.”

1756
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,380
That's the most important thing.
“face it honestly.”

“face it honestly.”

01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:16,140
Minseon: You're the only person

1778
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:20,660
Minseon: who chose me as a senior, right?

1779
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:23,290
-Jaeseung: Thank you for calling me. -Minseon: For what?

1780
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:27,700
(The call ends after 30 seconds)

1781

(Shy)

1783
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:42,760
(Laughs out of joy)

1784
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,810
Jaeseung: I wasn't expecting it.

1785
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:52,150
Jaeseung: I was in an anxious state when I got a call from Minseon

1786
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:56,330
Jaeseung: but the call made me feel better.

1787
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:02,470
Minseon: Did it end?

1788
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:04,630
(Pity)

1789
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:09,220
Minseon: Is 30 seconds this short...?

1790
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:14,230
Minseon: I didn't know 30 seconds was such a short time.

1791
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:19,150
Minseon: So I thought I should have organized what I wanted to say beforehand.

1792
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:24,710
Minseon: But the call itself was meaningful.

1793
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:30,580
Minseon: I called with the intention of "wanting to know about him more."

1794
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:40,330
(Youngjoon, please come to the phone booth and call someone you like within 30 seconds.)

1795
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:45,400
Youngjoon: I actually already decided before heading out

1796
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:48,220
Youngjoon: but on the way I was still choosing.

1797
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:51,640
Youngjoon: Choosing between two people.

1798
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:58,040
(Who are the two people Youngjoon's choosing?)

1799
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,140
Youngjoon: The two people that I'm choosing between are

1800
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:03,650
Youngjoon: Jaeseung, whom I haven't talked much to,

1801
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,610
I'm Bae Seongmin.

1802

Youngjoon: You can't tell? Seongmin: Ah,
Who is it?

1829
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,590
Youngjoon: You can't tell? Seongmin: Ah,

1830
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:11,790
I know.
Youngjoon: You can't tell? Seongmin: Ah,

1831
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:15,630
Youngjoon: Do you know now? -Seongmin: Yes.

1832
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:20,570
(Staring)

1833
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:24,580
Youngjoon: We didn't talk much today

1834
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:29,830
Youngjoon: so I called you hoping I can get closer with you.

1835
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:31,850
Seongmin: Ah, sure, thank you.

1836
01:14:31,850 --> 01:14:33,340
Okay.
Seongmin: Ah, sure, thank you.

1837
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:34,010
Seongmin: Ah, sure, thank you.

1838
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:41,900
(The call ends after 30 seconds.)

1839
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:43,240
He hung up.

1840
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:51,000
Youngjoon: "Let's get closer" was what I was thinking

1841
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:51,560
so I thought I needed to call one of them.
Youngjoon: "Let's get closer" was what I was thinking

1842
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,520
(Youngjoon needed to call either Jaeseung or Seongmin)
so I thought I needed to call one of them.

1843
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:59,300
Youngjoon: So I call Seongmin who made a great first impression.

1844
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:02,970
-Seongmin: Did he hang up? -Hwi: He hung up.

1845
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:07,300
Seongmin: He hung up? Ah...

1846
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:09,970
-Seongmin: I actually don't know who that was. -Hwi: Really?

1847
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:10,750
Seongmin: I couldn't tell.

1848
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:13,230
Seongmin: I really don't know who that was.

1849
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:16,740
-Hwi: He didn't tell you his name? -Seongmin: He didn't.

1850
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:19,020
Seongmin: But he said we didn't talk much.

1851
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:21,980
Seongmin: I don't know who it is.

1852
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:23,260
I don't know who it is.
Seongmin: I don't know who it is.

1853
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:24,220
Seongmin: I don't know who it is.

1854
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:32,290
Hwi: I was a bit sad and worried.

1855
01:15:32,290 --> 01:15:37,360
Hwi: I found out that there's someone other than me who's interested in him.

1856
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:39,590
(Hwi, please come to the phone booth and call someone you like within 30 seconds.)

1857
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:40,780
I got a text.
(Hwi, please come to the phone booth and call someone you like within 30 seconds.)

1858
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:41,660
Did you?
(Hwi, please come to the phone booth and call someone you like within 30 seconds.)

1859
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:43,050
(Hwi, please come to the phone booth and call someone you like within 30 seconds.)

1860
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:45,590
Seongmin: Even I'm nervous.

1861
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:47,430
Seongmin: Go ahead.

1862
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:10,920
(Nervous)

1863
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,420
Hwi: I was so nervous.

1864
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:16,950
Hwi: Even though I already decided who I want to call,

1865
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:18,950
Hwi: I didn't know what I was going to say.

1866
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:30,330
(What will Hwi say to express his feelings?)

1867
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:39,390
Hello?

1868
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:41,790
Hello.

1869
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:44,870
I'm your roommate.

1870
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:47,830
(Hwi's calls Seongmin)

1871
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:49,220
Hello.
(Hwi's calls Seongmin)

1872
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:50,630
I'm your roommate.
(Hwi's calls Seongmin)

01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:52,470
Yes.
(Hwi's calls Seongmin)

1874
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:53,460
Yes.

1875
01:16:54,430 --> 01:16:56,380
Seongmin: I think I just saw him earlier.

1876
01:16:57,490 --> 01:17:01,590
Hwi: I don't know what to say...

1877
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:10,410
From the first time we met till now, I always had a good feeling.

1878
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:14,220
Seongmin: Ah... Thank you...

1879
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:23,200
(Hwi mustered up his courage to express his feelings for the first time)

1880
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:29,780
Hwi: I called Seongmin today.

1881
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:31,590
Hwi: I wanted to express my feelings.

1882
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:35,630
Hwi: I also had a great first impression of him.

1883
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:40,310
Seongmin: Ah... How am I supposed to face him?

1884
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:44,020
How should I face him?

1885
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:49,190
Seongmin: What should I do... What should I do...

1886
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:53,150
Seongmin: I was really surprised.

1887
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:55,800
Seongmin: To be honest, I was really shy.

1888
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:00,350
Seongmin: But I was really happy.

1889
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:05,570
(Hwi comes back to the room after the call)

1890
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:09,220
-Hwi: Hello. -Seongmin: Hello.

1891
01:18:12,710 --> 01:18:14,380
(Hiding under the blanket)

1892
01:18:15,010 --> 01:18:18,120
(Shy)

1893
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:21,940
Hwi: Ah...

1894
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:25,420
Hwi: I'm so nervous.

1895
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:27,840
I'm just going to try to sleep.

1896
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:34,650
Seongmin: Thank you for calling me.

1897
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:40,250
Hwi: I was so nervous that I couldn't breathe.

1898
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:44,250
Seongmin: I was so shy I couldn't even look at him.

1899
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:48,460
Seongmin: I've never felt like that before in my life.

1900
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:52,470
Hwi: Ah, this is so embarrassing.

1901
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:53,760
Seongmin: I can't look directly at you.

1902
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,950
Seongmin: I'm looking at you through that mirror.

1903
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,350
(Seongmin's looking at Hwi through the mirror)

1904
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:03,800
Seongmin: When's it my turn?

1905
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:07,350
(Excitement and awkwardness coexists between the two men)

1906
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:08,310
It's hot.
(Excitement and awkwardness coexists between the two men)

1907
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:11,920
Seongmin: I'm so shy.

1908
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:18,810
(Who is the next man to express his feelings?)

1909
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:24,690
(Seungjin, please come to the phone booth and call someone you like within 30 seconds.)

1910
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:29,670
Seungjin: So the time has come.

1911
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:34,170
(Who does Seungjin have in mind?)

1912
01:19:37,450 --> 01:19:40,220
Seungjin: Even till the end, I was hesitating about who I should call.

1913
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:42,950
Seungjin: I thought about it for a long time.

1914
01:19:44,190 --> 01:19:47,580
Seungjin: About who I should call.

1915
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:52,270
Seungjin: I was still thinking even after going into the phone booth.

1916
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:55,490
Seungjin: Someone who made me feel comfortable.

1917
01:19:58,330 --> 01:19:59,390
It's comfortable.

1918
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:02,060
-It's spacious. -It's nice.

1919
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:02,240
(Seungjin: Of the people closest to my ideal man...)
-It's spacious. -It's nice.

1920
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:05,150
(Seungjin: Of the people closest to my ideal man...)

1921
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:08,200
(Seungjin: I was conflicted for a long time.)

1922
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:23,400
(Which of the two touched Seungjin's heart?)

1923
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:30,590
(Seungjin is calling)

1924
01:20:30,590 --> 01:20:35,550
(Seungjin is calling Youngjoon)

1925
01:20:36,610 --> 01:20:39,880
(Youngjoon: Hello?)
(Seungjin: Hello?)

1926
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:41,440
Hello?

1927
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:45,030
(Seungjin: Do you know who I am?)

1928
01:20:46,270 --> 01:20:52,240
(Youngjoon: Uh... Seungjin?)
(Seungjin: That's right.)

1929
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:57,340
(Seungjin: Today... was our first meeting. I'm shy with strangers,)

1930
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:03,150
(Seungjin: but I still want to thank you for making me feel comfortable. That's why I'm calling.)

1931
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:07,320
(Youngjoon: Thank you for feeling comfortable.)

1932
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:09,520
(Youngjoon: That's a relief.)

1933
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:12,440
(Seungjin: Hope you have a lovely night.)

1934
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:17,430
(The call ends after 30 seconds)

1935
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:21,730
(Seungjin: Anyway, it was the first call of the night.)

1936
01:21:21,730 --> 01:21:27,880
(Seungjin: I mostly felt relieved/good inside.)

1937
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:36,520
(Seungjin: I didn't want to show my feelings from the start.)

1938
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:39,230
(Seungjin: So I called Youngjoon,)

1939
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:41,970
(Seungjin: who made me the most comfortable.)

1940
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:48,090
(Seungjin took a step back and called the one he wanted to thank)

1941
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:54,680
(Youngjoon: He kept expressing his feelings to me,)

1942
01:21:54,680 --> 01:22:00,120
(Youngjoon: but did I just brush them off as gratitude?)

1943
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:03,330
(Youngjoon: After the call, it finally dawned on me)

1944
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:05,680
-I think—
-Got a call.

1945
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:06,610
What should I do?

1946
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:07,430
(Seongmin, please come to the phone booth and express your feelings for someone for 30 seconds)

1947
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:09,880
I have to go.
(Seongmin, please come to the phone booth and express your feelings for someone for 30 seconds)

1948
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:10,680
(Seongmin, please come to the phone booth and express your feelings for someone for 30 seconds)

1949
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:10,720
-Go ahead.
-I'll be right back.
(Seongmin, please come to the phone booth and express your feelings for someone for 30 seconds)

1950
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:12,310
(Hwi: Go ahead.)
-Go ahead.
-I'll be right back.

1951
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:13,060
(Hwi: Go ahead.)

1952
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:13,520
-Go ahead.

(Hwi: Go ahead.)

1953
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,240
-Go ahead.

1954
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:15,840
(Seongmin: I'll be right back.)
-Go ahead.
-I'll be right back.

1955
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:16,420
(Seongmin: I'll be right back.)

1956
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:22,720
(Seongmin, who leaves, and Hwi, who is nervous for some reason)

1957
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:28,240
(Seongmin: Why am I so nervous?)

1958
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:33,000
(Seongmin: What should I do?)

1959
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,380
(Seongmin: Really, what should I do?)

1960
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:42,970
(Nervous)

1961
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:44,150
Wait.

1962
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:48,130
(Seongmin: I was so nervous.)

1963
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:50,330
(Seongmin: I couldn't see anything.)

1964
01:22:50,330 --> 01:22:53,740
(Seongmin: I kept shaking. I picked up the phone and put it down.)

1965
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:54,770
I'm going crazy.
(Seongmin: I kept shaking. I picked up the phone and put it down.)

1966
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:59,150
(Why can't Seongmin call easily?)

1967
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:02,900
(Seongmin: I was very conflicted between two people. Jaeseung and...)

1968
01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:09,150
(Seongmin: And Hwi. I was conflicted.)

1969
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:23,240
(Among Jaeseung and Hwi, who will get Seongmin's call?)

1970
01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:30,780
(Seongmin: Hello?)

1971
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:35,660
(Seongmin called)

1972
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:39,060
(Seungjin called Hwi)

1973
01:23:40,670 --> 01:23:43,660
(Hwi: Hello?)
(Seongmin: Hello?)

1974
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:44,620
Hello?
(Hwi: Hello?)
(Seongmin: Hello?)

1975
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:45,230
(Hwi: Hello?)
(Seongmin: Hello?)

1976
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:50,070
(Seongmin; Do you know who I am?)
(Hwi: Yes, I do.)

1977
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:54,600
(Seongmin: No... Your voice sounds nice.)
(Hwi: Ah, thank you.)

1978
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:58,620
(Seongmin: I feel relaxed having you as a roommate.)

1979
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:02,950
(Shy)

1980
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:06,720
(Hwi: Me too.)
(Seongmin: Sorry, I'm hanging up.)

1981
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:07,980
-Okay.
-Okay.
(Hwi: Me too.)
(Seongmin: Sorry, I'm hanging up.)

1982
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:10,120
(Hwi: Me too.)
(Seongmin: Sorry, I'm hanging up.)

1983
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:18,690
(Hwi and Seongmin confirmed each other's feelings through the phone)

1984
01:24:19,770 --> 01:24:21,390
(Seongmin: I think this conversation was very important to me.)

1985
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:23,960

01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:26,250
(Seongmin: After deciding on Hwi,)

(Seongmin: But really...)

1997
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:08,870
(Seongmin: It's amazing. I was going to call you in the first place.)

1998
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:16,100
(Seongmin: When I was working, my MBTI showed I was equally extroverted and introverted.)

01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:29,460
Really.

(Hwi: When we... played the image game earlier,)

2004
01:25:35,070 --> 01:25:36,960
(Hwi: many people chose you.)

2005
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:40,970

2006
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:41,010
Well...
(Seongmin: Me? Really? I don't remember.)

Well...

2008
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:44,730

2016
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:09,780
(Hwi: Who are you?)

2017
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:14,820
(I said you got the most... votes today, right?)

2018
01:26:18,490 --> 01:26:19,830
Yes.

2019
01:26:19,990 --> 01:26:22,530

2028
01:26:57,970 --> 01:27:03,380
(Jaeseung: It disconnected.)

2029
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:09,630
(The phone suddenly rings)

2030
01:27:09,630 --> 01:27:18,260
