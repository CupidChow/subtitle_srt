(With Hwi as the final person,
Youngjoon's morning call is over)

I'll turn on the lights for you.
(With Hwi as the final person,
Youngjoon's morning call is over)

27
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,300
(Seongmin: I'm really.. really sleepy.)

28
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,620
(Seongmin: Seriously so sleepy.)

29
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,380
(Dazed)

30
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,460
(Hanmin: This is really the last day.)

31
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,980
(Hanmin: I was wondering if it was true. Is it a dream?)

32
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,980
(Hanmin: I was dazed.)

33
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,700
(Youngjoon: In this period of time, I gotta pack.)

34
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:29,700
(Youngjoon: There are more things I haven't worn in these clothes.)

35
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,420
(Youngjoon: But in the blink of an eye, it's time to leave.)

36
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,740
(Youngjoon: So this daily life has ended.)

37
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,820
(Youngjoon: It felt like a pity.)

38
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:42,820
Come and wash up.

39
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,550
(Minseon and Seungjin who are still working hard
sleeping in even till the very last)
Come and wash up.

40
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,190
You can't sleep anymore.
(Minseon and Seungjin who are still working hard
sleeping in even till the very last)

41
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,620

42
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,350
Hurry up.

sleeping in even till the very last)

43
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,020
(Minseon: I didn't want to get up.)

44
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,940
(Minseon: Maybe it was because I was sleepy. Or maybe it was because I thought it was a pity.)

45
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,020
(Minseon: I just didn't want to get up.)

(Seongmin: When...)

64
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,060
(Seongmin: As I was packing up,)

65
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,900
(Seongmin: I thought of the date then.)

66
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:11,220
(Almost done packing all that luggage)

67
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,980
((Style check)) ((Even at the very end))

68

71
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,780
(Seungjin: That was what I thought.)

72
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,460
(Seungjin: It was like a dream.)

73
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:40,940
(Leaving one by one, the four-people room is cleared out)

74
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:47,060
(Minseon: Looking at the empty clothes rack at the end made it feel real to me.)

75
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,140
(Minseon: The four-person room was really busy.)

76
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,300
(Minseon: We had a lot of luggage.)

77
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,020
(Minseon: That room looked particularly empty.)

78

(Minseon: It felt empty.)

79

(Jaeseung: I felt disappointed and a little pity, but also happy.)

80

(Jaeseung: Many emotions flashed by.)

81
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,950
(Seungjin: Can you do it?)

82
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,380
-You can do it.
-I can do it.
(Seungjin: Can you do it?)

83
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,900
(Hwi: I can do it. I can do it.)
-You can do it.
-I can do it.

84
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,780
It's better than two people moving and falling together.

85
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,020
(Huff)
It's better than two people moving and falling together.

86
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,560
It's better than two people moving and falling together.

87
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:31,260

(Youngjoon: It felt like a treasure I want to treasure.)

95
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,260
(Okay)

96
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,580
(Hanmin: Put it here. Youngjoon: Okay.)

97
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,980
(Seungjin looks at the area in his memories for a long time)

98
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,580
(Seungjin: Looking at the photos of me taken by others,)

99
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,140
(Seungjin: and the photos we took together,)

100
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,060
(Seungjin: it made me feel like the days spent in the Men's House)

101
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:44,700
(Seungjin: is something I'll remember for a long time.)

102
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,700
(Minseon: I love this one.)

103
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,460
(Minseon: Really. It's so emotional.
Myeongkyun: Take it away. Tear it off!)

104
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,659
(Myeongkyun: It's well decorated.)

105
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,980
(Myeongkyun: It felt like we really had a lot of fun.)

106
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:06,820
(Myeongkyun: Minseon always says let's take a polaroid first.)

107
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,980
(Myeongkyun: I thought thankfully we took these photos.)

108
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,180
(Myeongkyun: He really knows what's up.)

109
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,740
(Men gather after packing)

110
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,190
Is the whistle here?
(Men gather after packing)

111
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,640
(Youngjoon: Did you cry? During this time?)

112
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,100
Me?
(Youngjoon: Did you cry? During this time?)

113
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,240
(Youngjoon: Us yesterday.
Minseon: The day we cried, yesterday.)
Me?

114
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,740
(Youngjoon: Us yesterday.
Minseon: The day we cried, yesterday.)

115
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,860
(Hanmin: I think the day you cried was that day.)

116
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,220
(Hanmin: When we sat on the water facility yesterday...)

117
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,670
When you were taking that.
(Hanmin: When we sat on the water facility yesterday...)

118

(Hanmin: When we sat on the water facility yesterday...)

119
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,780
(Myeongkyun: Not here.)

120
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,380
(Myeongkyun: I really cried the most this year then.)

121
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,420
(Myeongkyun: Cried so hard I choked.)

122
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,409

(Myeongkyun: Cried so hard I choked.)

123
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:42,620
(Minseon: Today was different from normal.)

124
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,220
(Minseon: We were not thinking about what event is waiting for us?)

125
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,580
(Minseon: But how should we say goodbye?)

126
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,100
(Minseon: We thought about this more.)

127
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,540
(Hanmin: It almost felt like we were a family?)

128
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,700
(Hanmin: When I go out,)

129
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,740
(Hanmin: I keep saying I want to go back to our home.)

130

(Hanmin: I've started saying "our.")

131
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,180
(Hanmin: We've become that close.)

132
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,820
(Seongmin: Hwi! Can you take a photo for me?)

133
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,420
(Seongmin: I want to see how good you are at taking photos.)

134
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,300
(Hwi: Okay)

135
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,580
(Seongmin: Make me look like Seungjin.
Hwi: Like Seungjin? I have to shoot from above.)

136
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,940
(Seongmin: I'll sit down. I can't do expressions like Seongmin.)

137

(Hwi: Lean like this.)

138
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,540
Like this.
(Hwi: Lean like this.)

139
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,070
Like this.

140
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,460
Look a little more arrogant?

141
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,240
(Serious)
Look a little more arrogant?

142
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,540
What about my expression?
(Serious)

143
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,020
(Hwi: Oh. Okay.)

144
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,020
(Awkward)

145
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,299
(Seongmin: Should I open up my eyes bigger?
Hwi: Wait.)

Tilt your head a bit more towards here.
((Like this?))
(Hwi: Tilt your head a bit more towards here.)

149
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,020
Eyes this way.

150
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,179
No, don't move your head.

151

(Stiff) (Stiff)
No, don't move your head.

152
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,570
Just look this way.
(Stiff) (Stiff)

153
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,340
This way. This way.

154
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,650
(Ha...)
This way. This way.

155
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,460
Okay, okay.
(Ha...)

156
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,170
Okay, okay.

157
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,380
(Seongmin: Feels like a wooden doll?)

158
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,660
(Jaeseung: It's okay. The more uncomfortable the pose is, the better it looks on photos.)

159
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,860
(Hwi: But it looks good when you smile.)

160
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,240
(Seongmin: Ah, that's cute. It looks good though?)

161
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,440
-It's nice.
-It's cute.
(Seongmin: Ah, that's cute. It looks good though?)

162
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,100
Not bad.
(Seongmin: Ah, that's cute. It looks good though?)

163
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,620
(Jaeseung: Take one for me too.)

164
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,130
Take one for me too.
(Jaeseung: Take one for me too.)

165
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:11,500

(Seongmin: I'm sorry, I'm not good at taking photos.)

321
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,550
Let me check it.

322
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,980
(Hwi: He shot it vertically.)

This...

325
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,380
What is this? Combat mode?
(Photo by Seongmin)

326
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,980
(Seongmin: Other than Hwi, people here don't know how to take photos.)

327
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,940
(Seungjin: What is this? You said that?
Hwi: No, no.)

328
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,780
(Minseon: Hanmin! Take a photo for us.)

329
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,170
(After changing the photographer, asking for a photo)

330
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,230
You're changing a photographer now?
(After changing the photographer, asking for a photo)

331
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,170
(Hwi: It's pretty good. But, who knows?)
It's not that. It's pretty good. But, who knows?

332
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,460
Sure, sure.
(Hwi: It's pretty good. But, who knows?)

333
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:45,570
(Seungjin: It might be more beautiful.)
Sure, sure.
(Hwi: It's pretty good. But, who knows?)

334
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,140
(Seungjin: It might be more beautiful.)

335
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,780
One, two, three.
(Seungjin: It might be more beautiful.)

336
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,300
One, two, three.

337
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,120
(Check! Check!)
(Will the youngest members be satisfied with Hanmin's photography skills?)
One, two, three.

338
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,880
(Check! Check!)
(Will the youngest members be satisfied with Hanmin's photography skills?)

339
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,410
-Check! Check!
-I'm not good at taking photos.
(Check! Check!)
(Will the youngest members be satisfied with Hanmin's photography skills?)

340
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,700
Check it.

341
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,500
(Oh! Much better!)

342
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,700
(Finally something I can look at)

343
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,150
(Oh!)

344
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,820
Finally something you can look at?
(Oh!)

345
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,410
(Seongmin: Why? It was not good?
Hwi: It was good.)

346
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,980
-It was good. -It was good?
(Seongmin: Why? It was not good?
Hwi: It was good.)

347
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,660
Yes.
(Seongmin: Why? It was not good?
Hwi: It was good.)

348
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:02,900
(Hwi, what you said just now
could pierce through his heart like a dagger)
Yes.
(Seongmin: Why? It was not good?
Hwi: It was good.)

349
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,790
(Hwi, what you said just now

No, no.
(Hwi, what you said just now
could pierce through his heart like a dagger)

351
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:06,900
No, no.

352
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:06,980
(Sorry)
No, no.

353
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,380
(Sorry)

354
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,599
So pretty.
(Sorry)

355
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Finally perfect.

356
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:14,060
(Minseon: Are you leaving? Seungjin: Who is it?)

357
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,819
(Who is the second man to leave Men's House?)

358
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:16,390
(The final choice will be made now.
Myeongkyun, please make your way to the phone booth.)

359
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,630
It's me.
(The final choice will be made now.
Myeongkyun, please make your way to the phone booth.)

360
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,880
-Who is it?
-Myeongkyun.
(The final choice will be made now.
Myeongkyun, please make your way to the phone booth.)

361
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,319
It's me.

Myeongkyun, please make your way to the phone booth.)

362
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,060
(Myeongkyun: It felt more like a pity.)

363
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,540
(Myeongkyun: Now it's really the last...)

364
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,339
(Myeongkyun: The final final mission.)

365
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,140
(Myeonggyun: It was really a pity.)

366
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,140
(Myeongkyun: Just as I got close to everyone.)

367
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,780
(Myeongkyun: Seungjin doesn't think so.))

368
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,260
Just kidding.

369
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:35,290
(Seongmin: You worked hard. You really word hard.)
Just kidding.

370
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,090
-You worked hard.
-You worked hard, Seongmin.
(Seongmin: You worked hard. You really word hard.)

371
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,460
You worked so hard.
(Seongmin: You worked hard. You really word hard.)

372
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,680
(Myeongkyun: You finally accept my joke.)

373
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:42,900
-Jaeseung, you worked hard.
-You worked hard.
(Myeongkyun: You finally accept my joke.)

374
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,460
(Myeonggyun: Jaeseung, you worked hard.)

376
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,260
(Myeongkyun: See you again. Keep in touch.)

377
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,940
(Myeongkyun: Ah, my heart aches...)

378
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,140
(Hwi: Why is it so sad?)

379
00:17:59,140 --> 00:17:59,270
(Sad)
(Seongmin: It's really the last moment.)

380
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,270
It's really the last moment.
(Sad)
(Seongmin: It's really the last moment.)

381
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,700
(Sad)
(Seongmin: It's really the last moment.)

382
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,140
Shouldn't we go out and see him off?

383
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,290
(Seungmin: Who is it?)
Shouldn't we go out and see him off?

384
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,180
(Seungmin: Who is it?)

385
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:06,820
I think it's me.

386
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,620
(The final choice will be made now.
Hanmin, please make your way to the phone booth.)
I think it's me.

387

(The final choice will be made now.
Hanmin, please make your way to the phone booth.)

388

It’s interesting. It’s interesting.
(The final choice will be made now.
Hanmin, please make your way to the phone booth.)

389
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,620

390
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:12,760
(Hanmin: Bye.)
It’s interesting. It’s interesting.

391
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,810
(Hanmin: Bye.)

392
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,060
-No. What should I do?
-Take care.
(Hanmin: Bye.)

393

(Seungjin: Take care...)

398
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,210
Bye.

399
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,340
(Hanmin: To be honest, I knew the time for the final choice would come.)

400
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,780
(Hanmin: But I don't know why, I was still very nervous.)

401
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:30,760
(The men who are using hugs
to replace the many words to be said)

402
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,580
Let's hug for the last time.
(The men who are using hugs

(Hanmin: Don't cry.)

405
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:37,390
(He cries so easily!)

406
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,600
-He cries so easily!
-Really.
(He cries so easily!)

407
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:40,900

(Leaving Men's House one after another)

421
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,500
(Hwi: What is it?)

422
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,780
(Seongmin: Now?
Hwi: Is it you this time?)

423
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,780
Goodbye.
(Seongmin: Now?
Hwi: Is it you this time?)

424
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:10,940
This is really the last time we are seeing the people leaving.

You're the best.

(Seungjin: Be happy.)

434
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,810
(Seungjin: You smell so good.)

435
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:30,980
I got goosebumps.
(Seungjin: You smell so good.)

(Hwi: Do I have to go now?)
(Seungjin: Yes)

628
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:38,980
(So far, Hw has always called Seongmin)

629
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:48,740
(Has Hwi's feelings changed after his bowling date with Seongmin and Seungjin?)

630
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:09,980
(The person Hwi calls is...)

631
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,380
Go lie down over there.
(The person Hwi calls is...)

632
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,219
(Hwi calls Seungjin)
Go lie down over there.

633
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:14,500
(Hwi calls Seungjin)

634
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,620
(Seungjin: Hello?)
(Hwi: Hello)

635
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:24,420
(Seungjin: Yes?)
(Hwi: Hello)

636
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:30,659
(Seungjin: Why are you calling me?)
(Hwi: Today's date was so fun... Right?)

637
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:33,420
(Seungjin: I think so too)
(Hwi: It was really fun)

638
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,500
(Seungjin: Right)
(Hwi: Right)

639
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,179
(Hwi: I hope we can go on a date again)
(Seungjin: Okay)

640
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:44,300
(Hwi: Bye)
(Seungjin: Bye)

641
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,820
(Hwi: I'm really grateful to him)

642
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,260
(Hwi: Because you're most grateful to the person)

643
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:04,860
(Hwi: who stays by your side at your lowest)

644
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,100
(Hwi: That's Seungjin to me)

645
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:13,660
(Hwi: So I'm most grateful to him in this house)

646
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:24,740
(Seungjin: So far, I've only made calls and haven't received any)

647
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:30,780
(Seungjin: I guess I was looking forward to a call more than I thought)

648
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:38,100
(Seungjin: I was very thankful)

649
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:50,540
(Seungjin: I was a little shy. So I didn't dare to look at him)

650
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:58,420
(Hwi: It was a bit awkward)

651
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,340
(Youngjoon: You two, sit together)

652
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:02,840
(Youngjoon takes pictures of Hwi and Seungjin)

653
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,960
Make sure what you decorated can be seen.
(Youngjoon takes pictures of Hwi and Seungjin)

654
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,550
Put them on top of ours.
(Youngjoon takes pictures of Hwi and Seungjin)

655
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,740
(Seungjin, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like for 30 seconds)

656
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,550
I'll be right back.
(Seungjin, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like for 30 seconds)

657
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,700
-Go. -Go.
(Seungjin, please come to the phone booth and convey your feelings to the person you like for 30 seconds)

658
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,290
-Go. -Go.

659
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,580
(Hwi: I want to draw)

660
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,160
-Draw what you like. -Yeah.
(Hwi: I want to draw)

661
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:28,900
(Seungjin: Up until now, I'm feeling)

662
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,860
(Seungjin: the most butterflies in my stomach now)

663
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,980
(Seungjin: So today's call could be)

664
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:43,340
(Seungjin: the best one to express my feelings honestly)

665
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,060
(Seungjin: So I'm excited)

666
00:36:55,860 --> 00:37:01,060
(Who is the man who gives Seungjin butterflies?)

667
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,500
(Hwi is drawing a birthday present for Seongmin)

668
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,230
Go lie down over there.

669
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:16,820
(Hwi: Hello)
(Seungjin: Hello)

670
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:23,460
(Seungjin: Yesterday and today were really fun)
(Hwi: I agree)

671
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,500
(Shy)

672
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:32,540
(Seungjin: I'll be there to finish the album in a bit)
(Hwi: Okay)

673
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:35,380
(Seungjin: Okay)

674
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,660
(Shy)

675
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:53,540
(Seungjin: Despite what he feels for me,)

676
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:58,540
(Seungjin: I'm grateful that he called me)

677
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:02,180
(Seungjin: And hearing each other's voice through the phone call)

678
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:06,380
(Seungjin: felt a bit different)

679
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,220
(Last night's call that warmed Seungjin's heart)

680
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,960
Please leave a message after the beep.

681
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,680
Please press the hash button when you're done.

682
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,020
(Seungjin: Hmm...)

683
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:27,300
(Hyung,)

684
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:33,660
(to me, you were like a snowman in the desert)

685
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:42,700
(I hope it's not too cold or too hot)

686
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:51,420
(Seungjin: If we get a chance, let's see each other again)

687
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:20,100
(Finally, it's Hwi's turn)

688
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,100
(Hwi: During the time spent in Men's House,)

689
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:29,580
(Hwi: please leave the name of the man who made your heart flutter the most)

690
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,100
(Hwi: I'm actually relieved)

691
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:37,780
(Hwi: I'm just talking by myself in a voice message)

692
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:43,900
(Hwi: So I can be the most honest to my feelings)

693
00:39:51,340 --> 00:40:00,380
(Hwi: In my life, will I meet someone like that again?)

694
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:14,620
(Hwi: Thanks to you, I felt my heart flutter)

695
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:18,420
(Hwi: in a way I've never felt before.

696
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:24,740
(Hwi: No matter what choice you make in the future or who you get with...)

697
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:31,380
(Choked up)

698
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:45,380
(Hwi: I hope you can make a choice... that makes you happy)

699
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,060
(Hwi: I hope you live a happy life)

700
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:54,380
(Thank you for everything)

701
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:14,300
(With Hwi, all eight men have made their final choices)

702
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:21,300
(Time for the final results)

703
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:27,420
(Will the men become couples and meet again?)

704
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:33,620
(Youngjoon heading to the last location)

705
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:51,700
(Youngjoon arrives first at an empty cafe)

706
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:58,060
(Youngjoon: I left Hanmin a voice message today)

707
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:10,620
(Will Hanmin go to Youngjoon?)

708
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,940
(Meanwhile, at another location...)

709
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:30,660
(Minseon is waiting for someone)

710
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:41,940
(Minseon: I left Myeongkyun a voice message)

711
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,700
(Minseon: It rained a lot yesterday and the waters were rough)

712
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,980
(Minseon: The water is very calm,)

713
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,740
(Minseon: so I had so many thoughts running through my mind)

714
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,740
(Minseon: People's hearts are unpredictable)

715
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:59,740
(Will Myeongkyun choose Minseon?)

716
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:06,700
(Myeongkyun is heading to his final location)

717
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:22,660
(Nervous before the final results are revealed)

718
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:30,180
(Myeongkyun: I felt conflicted and unusual)

719
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:39,460
(Who's waiting for Myeongkyun at the place he arrived at?)

720
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:43,580
(Anxious)

721
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:55,620
(The seat in front of Youngjoon is still empty)

722
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:04,900
(Youngjoon: Every second felt like an eternity)

723
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:13,140
(Youngjoon: He should be here by now. Why isn't he here?)

724
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:18,380
(Youngjoon: What if the phone in my pocket rings first,)

725
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:25,220
(Youngjoon: telling me to leave because I didn't get a match?)

726
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:32,940
(Youngjoon: Maybe he liked being with me in Men's House but is unsure if it'd be the same outside?)

727
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:38,100
(At that moment, he hears footsteps)

728
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:51,740
(Hanmin: The man who makes my heart flutter the most is Youngjoon)

729
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:54,340
(Hanmin: Did you wait long?)

730
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:55,870
(Finally relieved)

731
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:56,840
What should I do?
(Finally relieved)

732
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,260
(Finally relieved)

733
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:04,660
(Holding hands)

734
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:10,180
(Youngjoon: Ah... Seriously...)

735
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,040
(Youngjoon: I kept... I kept...)

736
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,250
Really?
(Youngjoon: I kept... I kept...)

737
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,100
(Youngjoon: I kept... I kept...)

738
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:18,540
(Youngjoon: I was so relieved of my stress)

739
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:24,580
(Youngjoon: and burst out crying)

740
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:28,620
(Hanmin: You must've been nervous)

741
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:31,220
(Hanmin: You trusted me, right?)
(Youngjoon: Yes)

742
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:36,860
(Youngjoon: I trusted you. But you took so long)

743
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:41,860
(Youngjoon's at a loss for words as he's relieved and thrilled)

744
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:47,100
(I really want to be in a relationship with him)

745
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:51,860
(Hanmin: Why are you crying?)
(Youngjoon: Because I'm happy)

746
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:58,580
(At this moment, they confirmed each other's feelings)

747
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,920
(Youngjoon and Hanmin finally smile)

748
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,380
I've been waiting for you.
(Youngjoon and Hanmin finally smile)

749
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,620
(Youngjoon: You took so long to come)

750
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:17,100
(Youngjoon: The more time passed, the more anxious I got)

751
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:23,340
(Hanmin: I should've been the one waiting)

752
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,620
(Youngjoon: I'm happy)
(Hanmin: That's good)

753
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,140
(Hanmin: After seeing each other’s faces,)

754
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:40,780
(Hanmin: I suddenly felt like crying)

755
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:47,780
(Youngjoon: I was so worried that I'd get a message telling me that no one's coming,)

756
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:52,740
(Youngjoon: that my phone would ring)

757
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:57,140
(Hanmin: Hey. Don't cry)

758
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:01,380
(Hanmin: Aren't you the all-rounder with pretty smiling eyes?)

759
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,380
(Hanmin: So you should smile)

760
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:09,420
(Youngjoon: But... Do you agree with my key phrase now?)
(Hanmin: I agree)

761
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:15,020
(Youngjoon: I'll show it to you more in the future)

762
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,100
(Youngjoon: I've more to show you)
(Hanmin: Me too)

763
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:27,380
(Hanmin: There's a lot I haven't shown you in Men's House)

764
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:31,740
(Youngjoon: We can get to know each other slowly now)
(Hanmin: Yes)

765
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,700
There's more we don't know more about each other.

766
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,980
Yes.

767
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:41,300
(Youngjoon: Let's spend a lot of time together)
(Hanmin: We have a lot of time)

768
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,860
(Youngjoon: Shall we go?)
(Hanmin: Let's go)

769
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:50,660
(Youngjoon: I'm so relieved)

770
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:55,060
(Hold my hand tight!)

771
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,860
(Hanmin: He’s the one I liked the most from the beginning)

772
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,140
(Hanmin: We have similar preferences)

773
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,740
(Hanmin: Sometimes he's like a friend)

774
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:05,140
(Hanmin: and sometimes he's an attractive man)

775
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:11,380
(Hanmin: So I became more and more interested in him)

776
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:18,940
(If I had to choose, my heart fluttered the most during our first date)

777
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:23,300
(Youngjoon: We made rings, then we went to a cafe and chatted)

778
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,270
The first date with Hanmin, just the two of us.

779
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:33,540
(They expressed their feelings for each other from start to end)

780
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:39,470
Goodness.

781
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:51,460
(First couple of "His Man 3": Youngjoon <3 Hanmin)

782
00:48:54,180 --> 00:49:00,060
(Meanwhile, Myeongkyun came to meet Minseon)

783
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:06,380
(Myeongkyun: In Men's House, the man who makes my heart flutter the most is Minseon)

784
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,900
(Minseon: You're here)

785
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:13,860
(Myeongkyun: You looked back too soon)
(Minseon: Really?)

786
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:16,940
(Minseon: Everyone can tell it's you from the sound of your shoes)

787
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,580
(Myeongkyun: You knew it's me)
(Minseon: Yeah)

788
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:23,420
(Myeongkyun: He was waiting for me, as expected. I was touched)

789
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,020
(Myeongkyun: What if he found me too frustrating to date)

790
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,900
(Myeongkyun: and didn't choose me?)

791
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,940
(Myeongkyun: I was very worried)

792
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:37,460
(Myeongkyun: I didn't care for Minseon well)

793
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:40,740
(Myeongkyun: I missed the timing to care for him a lot of times)

794
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,500
(Myeongkyun: I thought a lot about that)

795
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,570
Time flies.

796
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:45,990
Yeah.

797
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:50,460
(Knocking)

798
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,620
(Myeongkyun: When we first went out, wasn't it really awkward?)

799
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:56,220
(Minseon: What?)
(Myeongkyun: When we first went out together)

800
00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:00,140
(Minseon: Our first date?)
(Yes)

801
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,060
(Minseon: Just thinking about that time...)

802
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,460
(Minseon: What did you say when you gave me the arrow card (to invite me on a date)?)

803
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:08,900
(Minseon: Was it "Thank you for helping me with my hair?")

804
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:16,540
(Myeongkyun: I'm not good at saying such stuff)
(Minseon: I know that too)

805
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:19,620
(Myeongkyun: I'm trying my best to express myself now)
(Minseon: Really?)

806
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:23,180
(Myeongkyun: I'll try to express myself better)
(Minseon: Good)

807
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:26,220
(Minseon: I'm so touched)
(Myeongkyun: Thank you for understanding me)

808
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,740
(Minseon: Myeongkyun said he isn't good at expressing himself,)

809
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:33,260
(Minseon: but I can clearly feel his affections)

810
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:37,940
(Minseon: It's the little things, so I can't remember it clearly,)

811
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:43,340
(Minseon: but I felt he expressed himself well enough)

812
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,820
(Myeongkyun: Thanks to you, I had a great time here)
(Minseon: That's a relief)

813
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:50,340
(Myeongkyun: Thank you)
(Minseon: No need to thank me)

814
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:55,780
(Myeongkyun: Rather than “thank you”...)
(Minseon: Do you want to find a better term?)

815
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:58,620
(Myeongkyun: I want to find a better term)

816
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:03,940
(Minseon: What terms are there?)

817
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:05,860
(Minseon: I have to think about it too)

818
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:08,420
(Minseon: A term better than "Thank you")

819
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:12,660
"I like you"? Is that not it?

820
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:12,940
((Shy) Myeongkyun: Ah, I don't know. I don't know)
"I like you"? Is that not it?

821
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,540
((Shy) Myeongkyun: Ah, I don't know. I don't know)

822
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,100
"I like you"? Is that not it?

823
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:18,540
(Surprised)
"I like you"? Is that not it?

824
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,020
"I like you"? Is that not it?

825
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,800
Ah, I don't know. I don't know.

826
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:26,940
(Minseon: What a surprise attack. So cute)

827
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:34,140
(Minseon: I decided on him when I received his letter)

828
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:40,140
(Minseon: Before that, I just was very interested in him)

829
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:43,660
(Minseon: After receiving his letter...)

830
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,730
I thought that he's the one.

831
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:48,820
That's what I thought.

832
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:48,860
(Myeongkyun: I think my ideal type has changed)
That's what I thought.

833
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,980
(Myeongkyun: I think my ideal type has changed)

834
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:54,980
(Myeongkyun: Someone who I'm comfortable with is who will bring me happiness)

835
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,300
(Myeongkyun: My values have changed)

836
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,750
(Minseon: I can't believe I'm riding this red car again)
(Myeongkyun: Our mato mato)

837
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:03,980
-Our Mato Mato. -Mato Mato.
(Minseon: I can't believe I'm riding this red car again)
(Myeongkyun: Our mato mato)

838
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:04,260
-Our Mato Mato. -Mato Mato.

839
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:04,950
(Good rapport as always)
-Our Mato Mato. -Mato Mato.

840
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:05,530
(Good rapport as always)

841
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:06,400
I'm riding Mato Mato again.
(Good rapport as always)

842
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,000
The car that'll take care of me for two more years, Mato Mato.
(Good rapport as always)

843
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,390
-Mato Mato. -I'll open the door for you today.

844
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:12,740
-Will you escort me? -Yes.

845
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:12,820
(Thank you)
-Will you escort me? -Yes.

846
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,260
(Thank you)

847
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:18,060
(Myeongkyun: I didn't do it for you on the first day, but of course I'll do it now)

848
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,700
(Minseon: Thank you)

849
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:22,940
-Thank you. -Thank you.

850
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:26,740
(Myeongkyun: I'll close the door for you)

851
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,940
Put on my seat belt.

852
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:33,780
-I need to practice that. -The view is beautiful.

853
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:36,300
(Myeongkyun: The view is really beautiful)
(Minseon: The view here is beautiful)

854
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,180
(Minseon: I need to practice that)
(Myeongkyun: What?)

855
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:39,860
(Minseon: Closing your car doors gently)

856
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:40,390
(Looking forward to the memories they'll make in the future)

857
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,660
Because the door is heavy.
(Looking forward to the memories they'll make in the future)

858
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,180
(Looking forward to the memories they'll make in the future)

859
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:48,180
(Let's go!)

860
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:54,500
(Minseon: Should I wear my glasses?)
(Myeongkyun: It's up to you)

861
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,500
(Minseon: Didn't you say I look good with or without them?)
(Myeongkyun: Yes)

862
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:04,980
("His Man 3" couple: Myeongkyun <3 Minseon)

863
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:25,260
(Hwi arriving at his first date location)

864
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:35,020
(Hwi: I'm going back to the same place I went to a week ago)

865
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:40,180
(Hwi: I realized I've changed a lot since then)

866
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:49,820
(Hwi looks calm)

867
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:55,100
(Hwi: I actually felt calm)

868
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,980
(Hwi: I liked the serenity)

869
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:07,380
(But he's still expecting someone)

870
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,340
(Sighing)

871
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,580
(Hwi: It's Seongmin)

872
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,540
(Seongmin: Hello)

873
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,980
(I'm your roommate)

874
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,480
I see.
(I'm your roommate)

875
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,380
(I'm your roommate)

876
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:40,780
(Hwi: From the first time I met you till now, I've always liked you.)

877
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:44,260
(Seongmin: Ah, thank you)

878
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:49,660
(Hwi: Because of Seongmin,)

879
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,020
(Hwi: for the first time in my life,)

880
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:55,900
(Hwi: I felt my heart flutter)

881
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,940
(Hwi: Like Seongmin...)

882
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,340
(Hwi: Someone who comforts you during tough times)

883
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,100
(Hwi: and someone I'm comfortable with)

884
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:10,500
(Hwi: I realized that's what I needed)

885
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:21,010
(From day one, Hwi only had eyes for Seongmin)

886
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:21,810
Isn't it good?
(From day one, Hwi only had eyes for Seongmin)

887
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:26,740
(Hwi and Seongmin's simple but special time spent together)

888
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:32,380
(Did Seongmin feel Hwi's sincerity?)

889
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:46,540
(Another man arrives at his first date location)

890
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:57,940
(Jaeseung looks nervous)

891
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:06,860
(Jaeseung: I left Seongmin a voice message today)

892
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:14,580
(Nervous)

893
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,660
(Jaeseung: Looking back, every moment)

894
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:20,820
(Jaeseung: was really precious)

895
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:23,540
(Jaeseung: The first time I met him,)

896
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:37,940
(Jaeseung: when we made calls to each other on the second day,)

897
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:43,860
(Jaeseung: and inviting Seongmin on a secret date on the third day)

898
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:47,900
(Jaeseung: and him following me...)

899
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,920
-Let's go. -Where?

900
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,770
On a date.

901
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:52,460
-With me? -Yes.

902
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:54,940

(Let's go on a date, Seongmin)
What's going on?

904
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,700
(Let's go on a date, Seongmin)

905
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:03,460
(Rather than remembering the memories, it'd be harder to forget them)

906
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:12,220
(A different kind of wait this time)

907
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:19,060
(Jaeseung: I was waiting to feel someone around me)

908
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:24,460
(Jaeseung: When I realized this side of me, I was a little surprised)

909

(Sighing)

910
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:41,740
(Will Jaeseung meet Seongmin here again?)

911
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,860
(Seongmin heading towards his final location)

912
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:52,020
(Seongmin chose...)

913
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:54,260
(Seongmin chose Jaeseung)

914

(All smiles)

915
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:05,540
(Seongmin: Ah... I was so nervous)

916
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:07,250
Wait.

917
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,980
(Seongmin: Ah... I was so nervous)

918
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,740
(Seongmin: When I saw Jaeseung waiting for me,)

919
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:20,060
(Seongmin: I became happy right away)

920
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:25,140
(Seongmin: This is where we first met)

(The two met for the first time here)

926

(Seongmin: Hello. I'm so nervous)

927
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,290
Me too.
(Seongmin: Hello. I'm so nervous)

928
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:37,100
(Seongmin: Hello. I'm so nervous)

929
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:39,330

934
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:44,860
Nice to meet you.

935
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:49,700
(First meeting and final choice)

936
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,490
I was really nervous.
(First meeting and final choice)

937
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:52,180
Me too.
(First meeting and final choice)

938
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:52,710
Me too.

939
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,180
(Seongmin: I'm nervous)

940
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:57,700
(Jaeseung: I waited so long, but you didn't come)

941
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:01,100
(Jaeseung: I'm so happy and want to cry)

942
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:05,860
(Jaeseung: It's really settled now)

943
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:13,780
(Jaeseung: Thinking of having a new start here, I'm so happy)

944
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:19,780
(Jaeseung: I realized I liked Seongmin when)

945
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:27,540
(Jaeseung: I called Seongmin on the third day)

946
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:31,940
(Jaeseung: but I found out he didn't call me)

947
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:38,020
(Jaeseung: I wouldn't be so sad if I didn't like him)

948
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:41,960
(So I really like Seongmin)

949
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,100
That's what I thought.
(So I really like Seongmin)

950
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:48,340
(Jaeseung becomes sure of his feelings because of an obstacle)

951
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:49,790
It's interesting.

952
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:51,630
When I arrived here...

953
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:54,620
(Seongmin: My first impression of him was that he was handsome)

954
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:57,780
(Seongmin: During the anonymous chat,)

955
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:02,940
(Seongmin: when asked about who he wanted to date,)

956
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,180
(Seongmin: Jaeseung answered "Seongmin")

957
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:10,420
(Seongmin: That answer made me so excited)

958
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,980
(Jaeseung's answer touched Seongmin's heart)

959
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:22,180
(Seongmin: Let's compare the size of our hands)

960
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:23,840
(Seongmin: Is your hand big?)

961
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:24,220
My hands are big.
(Seongmin: Is your hand big?)

962
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:24,540
My hands are big.

963
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:25,540
(They carefully touch each other's hand)
My hands are big.

964
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:25,930
(They carefully touch each other's hand)

965
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:27,740
It's a lot bigger.
(They carefully touch each other's hand)

966
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:28,900
(They carefully touch each other's hand)

967
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:30,460
(Seongmin: Why are your hands so big?)

968
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:34,580
(Jaeseung: My hands aren't big. It's just long)

969
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:42,100
(Seongmin: I want to be in a good relationship with him for a long time)

970
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,110
(Let's really go on a date now)

971
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:46,510
Let's really go on a date.
(Let's really go on a date now)

972
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:46,980
(Let's really go on a date now)

973
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:48,560
(Seongmin: Shall we go?)

974
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,740
Let's go.
(Seongmin: Shall we go?)

975
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,460
(Seongmin: Shall we go?)

976
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:54,920
Let's go.

977
01:00:57,340 --> 01:01:00,040
(Seongmin: That was so natural. I love it)

978
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,620
I love it.
(Seongmin: That was so natural. I love it)

979
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:08,260
(Jaeseung: I want to go to his favorite art exhibition with Seongmin)

980
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:17,740
(Jaeseung: I can't guarantee that I'd enjoy the exhibition)

981
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:23,740
(But if it's something Seongmin likes, I want to do it with him)

982
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:29,220
(Seongmin: For our first date, I think even a cafe date would be great)

983
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:30,900
(Seongmin: Since we haven't had a date before)

984
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:35,020
(Seongmin: A workshop, a movie, or a hotel staycation?)

985
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:37,620
(Seongmin: Is it too early for hotel staycation?)

986
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:40,860
(Shy)

987
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,810
(Seongmin: I think the weather is good too)

988
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:44,850
I know.
(Seongmin: I think the weather is good too)

989
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:47,140
(Seongmin: I think the weather is good too)

990
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:49,620
(Seongmin: The air is fresh too. It's nice)

991
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:54,540
("His Man 3" couple: Jaeseung <3 Seongmin)

992
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:05,980
(The time for the reveal of final choices has ended)

993
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:15,020
(Hwi: Ah... It's really over now)

994
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:24,740
(Hwi: I hope he can be happy. That's all I thought)

995
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:38,900
(Hwi: I want to tell Seungjin how I'm feeling)

996
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:44,260
(Hwi: and be comforted by him)

997
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:49,820
(Meanwhile, Seungjin driving to his last location)

998
01:02:54,900 --> 01:03:00,100
(Seungjin: Wow, it really feels like a dream)

999
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:09,220
(Seungjin: I felt empty)

1000
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:12,620
(It really felt like a dream)

1001
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:21,860
(Seungjin: In Men's House, the man who makes my heart flutter the most is Hwi)

1002
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:29,020
(Seungjin: I left a voice message to Hwi today)

1003
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:43,100
(Hwi does not reciprocate Seungjin's feelings)

1004
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:48,500
(Seungjin: I really started with a relaxed mindset)

1005
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:52,820
(Seungjin: So I didn't want to become too serious)

1006
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:55,340
(Seungjin: I didn't want to be too emotional)

1007
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:57,820
(Seungjin: I tried my best)

1008
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:00,900
(Seungjin: It was exhausting)

1009
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:09,020
(Seungjin had a confusing week with all sorts of new feelings)

1010
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:25,380
(Does Hwi know Seungjin is waiting for him?)

1011
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:30,460
(I hope Hwi would show up)

1012
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:48,580
(The time for the reveal of final choices has ended)

1013
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:57,300
(Seungjin is more conflicted after the text)

1014
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:10,540
(Seungjin: I really... have a lot of regrets)

1015
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:26,300
(Seungjin: It's both a relief and frustrating)

1016
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:31,460
(Seungjin: I felt mixed feelings)

1017
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:38,380
(Seungjin's time ends with regrets)

1018
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:46,060
(Seungjin: The ceramic workshop date with Hwi)

1019
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:49,540
(Seungjin: was like an oasis in a desert)

1020
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:54,660
(Seungjin: Hmm...)

1021
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:06,020
(Thinking back, I was happy)

1022
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:16,700
(Thinking back, Seungjin had a happy week)

1023
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:28,140
(The last voice messages left by the men)

1024
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:34,180
(What kind of confessions did the men make?)

1025
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:47,860
(Last time to convey their true feelings)

1026
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:54,700
(Minseon: Can I listen to (the voice message) now?)

1027
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:57,260
(Minseon: It's 31 seconds)

1028
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:04,020
(Myeongkyun: It was really awkward at first)

1029
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:08,540
(Myeongkyun: I didn't know what to say to keep the conversation going)

1030
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:10,260
(Myeongkyun: But as we spent more time together,)

1031
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:15,260
(Myeongkyun: I realized we were a good match a lot)

1032
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:20,700
(Myeongkyun: I didn't feel it much before,)

1033
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:25,700
(Myeongkyun: but I now feel your various charms)

1034
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:28,380
(Thank you)

1035
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:32,140
(Minseon: Wait, this person...)

1036
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:37,100
(Minseon: Why did he say the same things he did in the letter?)

1037
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:40,420
(Minseon: I expected this)

1038
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:42,780
(Minseon: But I'm still happy)

1039
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:46,580
(Myeongkyun: It's a long (voice message))

1040
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:54,140
(Minseon: I like that we have a similar sense of humor)

1041
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:58,620
(Minseon: Well... Thank you for always taking care of me)

1042
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:03,140
(Minseon: You always told me...)

1043
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:07,220
(Minseon: I take care of you but you've never reciprocated it)

1044
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:12,700
(Minseon: I feel like I've been taken care of by you too)

1045
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:22,260
(I want to meet you soon)

1046
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:32,380
(Myeongkyun cries beceause of Minseon's sincerity)

1047
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:39,020
(Myeongkyun: I'm really thankful to him)

1048
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:43,420
(To: Minseon)
(Myeongkyun: I'll work harder from now on)

1049
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:45,819
(To: Minseon)
(Myeongkyun: Let's get along well)

1050
01:08:48,689 --> 01:08:50,740
I'm so nervous.

1051
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:51,250
(Smiling once he hears Hanmin's voice)

1052
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:56,120
During the time we spent in Men's House,
(Smiling once he hears Hanmin's voice)

1053
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:58,170
I was really happy.
(Smiling once he hears Hanmin's voice)

1054
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:03,700
(Hanmin: Actually, through the letter...)

1055
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:08,380
(Hanmin: I don't think I expressed my feelings well)

1056
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:14,620
(Thank you so much. Let’s meet soon)

1057
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:18,260
(Hanmin: Bye)

1058
01:09:18,939 --> 01:09:23,779
(Happiness)

1059
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:32,060
(Youngjoon: It's very much like Hanmin's style)

1060
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:35,859
(Youngjoon: While he's shy,)

1061
01:09:35,859 --> 01:09:41,420
(Youngjoon: he tries to express his feelings bravely)

1062
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:46,020
(Youngjoon: I felt his sincerity, so I'm happy)

1063
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:52,180
(Hanmin: Do I listen to it now?)

1064
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:01,140
(Youngjoon: Hanmin, I'm very happy to meet you)

1065
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:05,860
(Youngjoon: I was very happy. When I was having a tough time...)

1066
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:13,700
(Youngjoon: When I had a tough time, you always comforted me)

1067
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:17,860
(Youngjoon: and protected me. Thank you so much)

1068
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:20,260

(Hanmin: Why...)

1073
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:39,580
(Choked up)

1074
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:42,700
(Hanmin: In the end...)

1075
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:46,260

1088
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:56,060
(Jaeseung: Unfortunately, I didn't get to have a date with you outside)

1089

(Jaeseung: When we leave, let's go somewhere together)

1090
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:08,380

(Hwi: A lot has happened in this week)

1098
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:45,620
(Hwi: I know your feelings have changed)

1099

(Hwi: I felt my heart flutter for the first time)

1102

(I hope you have a happy life)

1106
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:35,940
(Thank you for everything)

1107
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:41,780
(Seongmin feels sorry and grateful)

1108
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:45,180
(Seongmin: I feel so sorry)

1109
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:51,900
(Seongmin: But...)

1110
01:13:56,260 --> 01:14:05,100
(Seongmin: I didn't do anything for him, but he still likes me, so I'm grateful)

1111
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:09,780
(Seongmin: I'll always be friends with Hwi)

1112
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:19,820
(Finally, one voice message to Hwi)

1113
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:29,460
(Seungjin: Hwi... to me...)

1114
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:34,860
(You were like a snowman in the desert)

1115
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:40,860
(Seungjin: I don't want to be too cold or too hot)

1116
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:46,540
(Seungjin: If there's a chance in the future,)

1117
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:51,540
(Seungjin: let's meet again)

1118
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:12,860
(Seungjin conveys his true feelings to Hwi too late)

1119
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:15,580
(Hwi: Oh...)

1120
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:18,020
(Hwi: I didn’t expect a voice message)

1121
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:22,500
(Hwi: I'm happy to hear one)

1122
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,260
(Hwi: I was moved)

1123
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:30,300
(Hwi: I didn't know someone liked me that much)

1124
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:38,740
(To: Seungjin)
(Hwi: I'm just really grateful to him)

1125
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:40,620
(The one who didn't get a voice message...)

1126
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:44,300
I didn't achieve anything.
(The one who didn't get a voice message...)

1127
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:44,900
I didn't achieve anything.

1128
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:46,900
(Seungjin: So... I have some regrets)

1129
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:50,780
(Seungjin: But during the time I spent alone)

1130
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:53,500
(Seungjin: in Men's House,)

1131
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:57,100
(Seungjin: I did my best every day)

1132
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:04,900
(A passionate week for the men)

1133
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:24,140
(Men's House filled with their own stories)

1134
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:30,660
(Seungjin: I feel like I've more matured a bit)

1135
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:34,220
(Seungjin: For the future...)

1136
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:38,140
(Seungjin: Today, yesterday, and everything that happened here)

1137
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:42,420
(Seungjin: would help me greatly in my life)

1138
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:46,460
(Seungjin: I think I've become more resilient)

1139
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:51,220
(Youngjoon: We were given very little time to express ourselves)

1140
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:54,140
(Youngjoon: through letters and calls)

1141
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:57,180
(Youngjoon: Hence, I was able to be unreservedly honest about my feelings)

1142
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:02,020
(Youngjoon: This is probably the week where I was the most honest with myself)

1143
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:06,500
(Hanmin: I met a group of really good people)

1144
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:11,660
(Hanmin: Because I had a rare and special experience)

1145
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:15,660
(Hanmin: I really had a good time throughout)

1146
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:18,460
(Hanmin: So I don't regret anything)

1147
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,820
(It's like a dream)

1148
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:24,900
(Jaeseung: Like I've had a good dream)

1149
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:28,500
(Jaeseung: Actually, I don't want to wake up now)

1150
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:35,100
(I hope I can have this dream again when I fall asleep)

1151
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:37,500
(Seongmin: It was really a special birthday)

1152
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:41,340
(Seongmin: It really, really felt like a summer's dream)

1153
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:47,500
(Seongmin: It's a summer that I'll never forget)

1154
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:54,380
(Hwi: Oh, so I can love someone with all my might)

1155
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:58,900
(Hwi: I didn't know I could love so passionately)

1156
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:02,740
(Hwi: Thanks to every memory here,)

1157
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:07,340
(Hwi: I can have a more mature relationship in the future)

1158
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:10,380
(Myeongkyun: As time went by,)

1159
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:11,820
(Myeongkyun: I was always half-worried and half-excited)

1160
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:15,100
(Myeongkyun: This is probably the most complicated I've ever felt)

1161
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:18,420
(Myeongkyun: In the future,)

1162
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:21,940
(Myeongkyun: I will remember my growth here)

1163
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:23,820
(Myeongkyun: and that I met so many great people here)

1164
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:25,500
(Minseon: A person that makes you feel comfortable)

1165
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:29,260
(Minseon: A person that's nice)

1166
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:32,900
(Minseon: I hope that's how they'll see me)

1167
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:35,820
(Minseon: Thank you so much)

1168
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:41,140
(I had a therapeutic week here)

1169
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:44,980
(A week in Men's House that felt like a dream)

1170
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:51,420
(From the first meeting to the moment of parting)

1171
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:55,380
(Happy times spent with the eight men)

1172
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:58,260
(Thank you for supporting "His Man 3")

1173
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:01,860
(Splendid times they have spent in Men's House)

1174
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:15,360
Hello.

1175
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:36,000
Exactly the same.

1176
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:51,580
(Great ^^&)

1177
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:03,260
(Men's love will continue into the future)
