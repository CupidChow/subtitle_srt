(The three who got close quickly)

165
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:45,320
(Youngjoon: To be honest, I think I've talked the least)

166
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,230
(Youngjoon: with Seongmin and you, hyung)
(T/N: "hyung" is a Korean term for addressing an older male)

167
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,770
(Youngjoon: So I was torn between you two for the call)

168
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:50,860
Who should I call between you two?

171
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,850
(Youngjoon: So I didn't want to join the crowd)

172
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:08,330
(Youngjoon: So I decided on calling Seongmin)
(Oh, really?)

177
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,540
(Jaeseung: Why are you calling me hyung?)

(Youngjoon: Me? Instinctually...)

182
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,230
Oh... So now you just assume I'm older?
(Youngjoon: Me? Instinctually...)

186
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,630
It's possible.
(Youngjoon: Oh, right. It was subconscious)

187
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,580
(Youngjoon: Oh, right. It was subconscious)

188
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,180
Aren't you older?

189
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,210
(One who wants to call him hyung; the other who doesn't want to be called hyung)

00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,630
(Drawing a fortune)

201
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,400
Use my free time...
(Drawing a fortune)

202
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,920
(Drawing a fortune)

203
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,320
(Okay)

204
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,000
(Due to the morning exercise)

If you know what you want, go get it.

210
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,490
(Let's go get it)

211
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,330
(Is Youngjoon's fortune hinting at something?)

212
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,110
(Can I get it...)

213
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,520
(Seongmin: Did you sleep well?)
(Hwi: I slept like a log)

214

(Minseon's focused on preparing breakfast)

225

(Youngjoon saw the mission card first)

227
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:00,700

228
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,550
-What? -Did you see it?

(Minseon: Oh, I didn't see it)

232
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:09,680
(Youngjoon: It might be first come first served, so I check it from time to time)

233
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,800
(Youngjoon: It doesn't matter)

234
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,230
(Minseon: What's written on it?)

235
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,450
(Youngjoon: Roommates will go on a date today)

236
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:22,810

(Minseon: If I go on a date with Youngjoon,)

243
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:41,050

244
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,970
(Jaeseung: Smells good)
(Minseon: It's French toast)

245
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,340
(Jaeseung: It's not ready yet, right?)
(Minseon: Yes, it'll take some time)

246

(Jaeseung: Do you need help?)

247
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:57,160
(Minseon: Um... I'm fine right now)

248
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,650
(Minseon: Or you could cut (the bread) into quarters)

249
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,160
(Minseon: Did you see the (mission card)?)

250
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,460

(Jaeseung: Should I check it out too?)

256
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:15,940
Like that?

257
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,620
I soaked it for too long.

258
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,810
(Jaeseung: I think I'm flustered)

259
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:35,060
(Jaeseung: I had someone in mind to date)

260
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:39,910

(Jaeseung: Today is a date with your roommate)

262
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:48,370
(Minseon: Yeah. So are you going on a date with Seungjin?)
(Jaeseung. I know)

263
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,760
(Minseon: I wanted to stop making French toast, but a lot of the egg mixture's left)
(Jaeseung: Right. It's okay)

264
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,310
(Jaeseung: Why don't you make scrambled eggs with it?)
(Minseon: Oh, should I?)

265
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,900
(Minseon: But this is mixed with milk. Is it okay?)

266
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,370
(Jaeseung: Many people make scrambled eggs with milk)
(Minseon: Really?)

267
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,010
(Minseon: Then I'll use it to make scrambled eggs)

268
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,500
(Next, Seungjin checks the card too)

269
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,380
Wow.

270
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:18,830

273
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,340
(I'm so happy after seeing that card)

274
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,790
(Date with his ideal type)
(Hands getting busy)

275
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,050
(Choosing carefully)

276
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:46,420

(Jaeseung: So I decided your date partner for you)

282
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,530
(Minseon: I know)

283
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,340
(Minseon: Oh, right! Since you assigned the roommates)

284
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,270
Because I assigned the roommates.
(Minseon: Oh, right! Since you assigned the roommates)

285
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:16,610
(Jaeseung: Anyway, I was the one who gave (Hwi and Seongmin) a chance to date)

286
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,380
(Jaeseung: I don't feel too good about it)

287
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,370
Like this.

288
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,430
Very...

(Jaeseung: Did you read that?)
(Seungjin: What?)

298
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:40,970
Did you read that? The card.

302
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,500

303
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,220

304
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,180

305
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,300

(Youngjoon comes downstairs)

309

00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,420
(Jaeseung: I thought we wouldn't get along well)

1069
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,480
(Jaeseung: But I gradually got comfortable with his mischief)

1070
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,850
(Jaeseung: I started considering if this is)

1071
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:08,790
(Jaeseung: what a good rapport is)

1072
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,520
(Jaeseung: Don't you feel hungry?)

1073
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:16,680
(Seungjin: Me? Now that you mention it, I'm hungry)

1074
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,880
(Jaeseung: I got hungry watching them eat)

1075
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,100
(Seungjin: What do you want to eat? Didn't you say you want Korean food?)

1076
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,860
(Jaesung: I like Korean food)
(Seungjin: Korean food?)

1077
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:26,890
(Jaeseung: Totally)

1081
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,480
(Then let's go eat Western food)

1082
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:37,070
(Gosh, seriously! I knew it)

1083
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:38,230
After eating Western food...
(Gosh, seriously! I knew it)

1084

After eating Western food...

1085
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,580
(Jaeseung: I enjoyed the date because it wasn't clichéd)

1086
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:47,400
(Jaeseung: It was novel, the weather was hot, but I also had fun)

1087
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:53,170
(Seungjin: It was much easier to talk with him than expected,)

1088
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:56,100
(Seungjin: and I felt comfortable with him)

1089
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:56,340
So compared to yesterday, I'm even more interested in him.
(Seungjin: and I felt comfortable with him)

1092
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:08,000
(They became closer as they teased each other and joked around)

1093
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,500
(Seongmin: The weather's nice. It's not that hot)

1094
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:18,070
(Seongmin: I think it'll be really fun)
(Hwi: I agree)

1095
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:21,190
Café... rattan workshop?

1096
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,070
(Seongmin: It's a rattan workshop)

1097
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:33,540
(A cute rattan workshop date filled with good vibes)

1098
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:37,520
Today, we'll make a cup holder.

(Seongmin and Hwi's choice is to make a rattan cup holder)

1103
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,940
For it to be pretty, try to maintain the same distance.

1104
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:48,250
-Same distance? -Yes.

1105
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:49,260
Okay.

1106
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,160
It's better to make it as tight.

1107
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:53,810
Have you always liked rattan?

1108
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,060

(Seongmin: I really like the vibe (that rattan gives))

1124
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,300
(Seongmin: It's the vibe of our entertainment room)

1125

What? It doesn't matter.

(Seongmin: Try pulling these up)

1148
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:39,900
Pull these up. Like this.
(Seongmin: Try pulling these up)

I'm not sure either.
(Sweet Seongmin teaches him)

1151
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,000

No.
(Seongmin: Maybe your method was right)

(Hwi: While making it together,)
But...

1156

1186
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:47,220

1194
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,490
(Seongmin: Based on first impressions)
(Hwi: First impression?)

1195
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:15,640
(Hwi: The first person I met was Youngjoon)

1196

1197
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:30,590

1198
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:34,660
(Seongmin: Didn't Jaeseung call (you)?)
(Hwi: Yes)

1199
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:37,000
(Seongmin: Didn't you talk after that?)

1200
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:42,650
(Hwi: It kind of became awkward)

1201
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:45,600
(Seongmin: I think I saw you two talking, didn't you?)

1202
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,440
(Hwi: We didn't mention that)
(Seongmin: Oh)

1203
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:54,170
(Hwi: Were you a little jealous?)

1204
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:58,880
(Seongmin: Jealous? I was a little annoyed)

1205
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,930

Right.

1208
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:11,520
(Seongmin: I couldn't keep a poker face)
(Hwi: Really?)

1209

(Hwi: When he said it made him upset,)

1211
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:24,600
(Hwi: I'm quite relieved)

1212
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:28,940
(Hwi: I'm glad that)

1213
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:31,240
(Hwi: we called each other)

1214
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:31,760
(Seongmin: Me too)

1215
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:38,650
(Seongmin: I wanted to tell you you have a nice voice)

1216
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,700
(Seongmin: I'm getting shy)

1217
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:44,450
(Seongmin: Do you think we're a good fit?)

1218
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:48,120
(Hwi: I think we're the best fit)
(Seongmin: Really? Me too)

1219
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:48,700
I also think our personalities fit.

1220
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,270
(Seongmin: I also think our personalities fit)
(Hwi: Yes)
I also think our personalities fit.

1221
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:51,180
Yes.
(Seongmin: I also think our personalities fit)
(Hwi: Yes)

1222
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:51,760
(Seongmin: I also think our personalities fit)
(Hwi: Yes)

1223
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,360
(Seongmin: It's rare)

1224
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,990
(Hwi: We're both good at rattan craft too)
(Seongmin: I know)

1225
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:57,140
(Hwi: We can do business together)

1226
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,270
(Seongmin: Should we open a workshop together?)

1227
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:01,960
-Workshop... -Sounds good.

1228
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,230
(Workshop)
-Workshop... -Sounds good.

1229
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,860
(Workshop)

1230
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:13,540
(Hwi: After we finish making this, shall we go buy flowers?)

1231
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,760
(Seongmin: Can we buy flowers?)

1232
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,620
(Hwi: I thought it'd be nice to buy some flowers)
(Seongmin: Okay)

1233
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:22,530
(Hwi: (to commemorate) our first date)
(Seongmin: Sounds good. Flowers are great)

1234
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:27,350
(Seongmin: I've never received flowers before. I don't see them much)

1235
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,090
(Hwi: I should buy you flowers today then)

1236
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:32,180
(Shy) (Seongmin: Okay)

1237
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,210
Okay.
(Shy) (Seongmin: Okay)

1238
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:38,180
(Seongmin: Have you sprayed the water?)
(Hwi: Yes)

1239
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:41,400
(Seongmin: Are you planning to give this to anyone?)

1240
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:44,550
(Hwi: I...)

1241
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:46,750
(Hwi: I plan to give it to my roommate)

1242
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:49,140
(Seongmin: Me? For me?)
(Hwi: Yes)

1243
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,940
(Hwi: What about you?)
(Seongmin: I...)

1244
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,620
(Seongmin: It's a secret)

1245
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:58,000
(Seongmin: I haven't decided yet)
(Hwi: Really?)

1246
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:00,820
(Hwi: Okay)

1247
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:13,160
(What does the undecided Seongmin really feel?)

1248
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:19,210
(Are they reciprocating each other's affection?)

1249
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:24,830
(Gradually, they've finished making their rattan cup holders)

1250
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:29,060
(Hwi: I think mine's done)
(Seongmin: Your's really pretty)

1251
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:32,530
(Seongmin: You did a great job. Really)
(Hwi: Really?)

1252
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:34,020
I did a great job?
(Seongmin: You did a great job. Really)
(Hwi: Really?)

1253
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:37,070
(Seongmin: How about mine?)
(Hwi: It's good)

1254
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:41,490
(Seongmin: It's good?)
(Hwi: It looks natural)

1255
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:42,770
(Seongmin: It was intentional)

1256
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:46,880
(Hwi: He wasn't very good at it,)

1257
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:51,520
(Hwi: but in my eyes, he was cute)

1258
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:55,370
(Seongmin: It embodies artistic, naturalistic vibes)
Hwi: Oh. naturalistic... that's nice)

1259
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:58,900
(Seongmin: Doesn't it suit my hand?)
(Hwi: It suits you well)

1260
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:02,940
(Seongmin: What do you think?)
(Hwi: It suits you well)

1261
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:09,510
(Their rattan cup holders perfect for summer)

1262
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:16,820
(Hwi: I haven't been to a flower shop in a long time)
(Seongmin: I've never received flowers before. I've only given them)

1263
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:20,530
(Hwi: You'll receive them today then)

1264
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:23,050
(Seongmin: They're all so pretty)

1265
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:24,860
(Hwi: What kind of flower is this?)

1266
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,250
(Tulips)

1267
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:28,300
(Hwi: The tulips look nice)

1268
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:30,050
(Hwi: Can you wrap it with tulips?)

1269
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:32,250
-Shall I wrap it together for you? -Yes.
(Hwi: Can you wrap it with tulips?)

1270
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:37,500
(Hwi: Tulips symbolize "confessions of love")

1271
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:41,160
(Hwi: So I thought I picked well)

1272
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:42,980
So pretty.

1273
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:46,120
(Hwi: It'll look pretty if you make a bouquet)

1274
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:52,740
(Hwi: If you see a flower that suits me...)

1275
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:53,590
(Seongmin: Okay)

1276
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,990
(Seongmin: I'll buy it for you)

1277
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:56,190
Flowers...
(Seongmin: I'll buy it for you)

1278
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:56,690
Flowers...

1279
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:59,550
I'd like one more.

1280
01:00:59,880 --> 01:00:59,920
-To be put in a vase. -To be put in a vase?

1281
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,320
(Seongmin: To be put in a vase)
-To be put in a vase. -To be put in a vase?

1282
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,740
Yes, to be put in a vase.
(Seongmin: To be put in a vase)

1283
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:04,500
(Seongmin: To be put in a vase)

1284
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,100
(Seongmin: One that looks like you)

1285
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:06,120
(The owner recommends the Clematis)

1286
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,950
Clematis is pretty too.
(The owner recommends the Clematis)

1287
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:09,240
(The owner recommends the Clematis)

1288
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,350
(Seongmin: It's really pretty. This is good)

1289
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:14,210
(Hwi: It's really pretty)
(Seongmin: Yes, it's really pretty)

1290
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:15,190
(Hwi: What kind of flower is this?)

1291
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:15,310
-Calla. -Calla?
(Hwi: What kind of flower is this?)

1292
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:16,500
(Calla)
-Calla. -Calla?

1293
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:16,960
(Calla)

1294
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,420
(Calla's often used to make bridal bouquets)

1295
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:20,540
(Seongmin: It's really pretty)

1296
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:21,870
(It's elegant)

1297
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:24,410
(It's a combination often used in weddings)

1298
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:26,630
(Oh, weddings?)

1299
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:30,150
(Seongmin: Do we have to get married? Wedding?)

1300
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:33,020
(Hwi: At that moment, my heart fluttered)

1301
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:38,550
(Hwi: It was my first time getting flowers. It was really nice)

1302
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:40,460
Your flowers are wrapped.

1303
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:42,190
(The flowers they chose for each other are wrapped) (Thank you)
Your flowers are wrapped.

1304
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:42,940
(The flowers they chose for each other are wrapped) (Thank you)

1305
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,820
-Thank you. -Thank you.
(The flowers they chose for each other are wrapped) (Thank you)

1306
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:45,340
(The flowers they chose for each other are wrapped) (Thank you)

1307
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:51,600
(Seongmin: It was my first time receiving flowers)

1308
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:56,790
(Seongmin: So I was very touched)

1309
01:01:56,790 --> 01:02:00,700
(Hwi: I couldn't smell the flowers because of my rhinitis)

1310
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:05,840
(Hwi: But Seongmin's perfume smelled nice)

1311
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:12,000
(On the other hand, the eighth man's driving to his date)

1312
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:18,080
(Who is his date?)

1313
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:24,970
(Someone more handsome than me? It's rare)

1314
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:28,630
(In terms of appearance, I like pretty guys)

1315
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:32,010
(I like people with bright eyes like rabbits)

1316
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,290
(Frankly, I have high standards)

1317
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:40,100
(So many people call me "Michelin")

1318
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,270
(I prefer someone older than me)

1319
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:44,860
(Based on my experience,)

1320
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:49,840
(it's hard to maintain a serious relationship with a friend of the same age)

1321
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:53,310
(I have standards for every possible aspect of a person)

1322
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:56,540
(I'll be fully prepared before going in)

1323
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:59,280
(With the mentality of winning everything)

1324
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,150
To describe myself in one phrase...

1325
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,930
(To describe myself in one phrase:)
To describe myself in one phrase...

1326
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:03,630
(To describe myself in one phrase:)

1327
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:06,850
("An unexpectedly devoted partner despite my pretty face")

1328
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:11,240
(Myeongkyun)

1329
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:16,540
(Who's Myeongkyun driving to?)

1330
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:22,010
Oh no.

1331
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:23,160
(Atmosphere becoming strange)

1332
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:23,990
It's okay.
(Atmosphere becoming strange)

1333
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:26,370
-What's wrong with me? -It's okay.
(Atmosphere becoming strange)

1334
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:28,470
(Atmosphere becoming strange)

1335
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,530
(The last man, Myeongkyun, moves into Men's House)

1336
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:35,050
(My heart dropped)

1337
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:40,270
(It was shocking)

1338
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:44,820
(It's messy now) (It's not)

1339
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:48,230
(We weren't in a relationship after all)

1340
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:51,790
(As a romantic partner...)

1341
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:57,290
(I can say that there wasn't nothing)

1342
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:58,350
What could it be?

1343
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,070
Wow.

1344
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:03,880
You can reveal your name, age, and occupation now.

1345
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:07,180
(Finally revealing the men's names, ages, and occupations)
You can reveal your name, age, and occupation now.

1346
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:08,590
Let's vote for who we're most curious about.
(Finally revealing the men's names, ages, and occupations)

1347
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:10,050
My age is...

1348
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:13,430
Mine's quite unique...

1349
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:15,280
My age is...

1350
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,800
I have many jobs.

1351
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,350
I...

1352
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:21,800
(It was unexpected)

1353
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,750
(So this is destiny)

1354
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,170
(I became much less)

1355
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:29,890
(interested in him)

1356
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,420
(I'm so annoyed)

1357
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:37,700
(That's when I realized I was jealous)
