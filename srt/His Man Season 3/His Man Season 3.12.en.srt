00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,620
(Myeongkyun: Your cooking is indeed worth looking forward to)

162
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,900
(Minseon: But there's nothing to look forward to it)

163
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,940
(Minseon: As long as the meat is ready, I'll just fry it)

164
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,380
(Minseon: There's no special seasoning)

165
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,220
(Myeongkyun: But it's a lot of work just doing that)
(Minseon: True)

166
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,620
(Minseon: But I have you helping me)

167
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,140
(Minseon: So I can finish it quickly)

168
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,060
(Putting pork cutlets coated in flour + egg + bread in the oil)

169
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,540
(Wow! Look at this)

170
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,690
(Oh, it's frying well)

171
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,530
Right?
(Oh, it's frying well)

172
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,420
(With a pleasant sound, the pork cutlets are getting fried)

173
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,100
Wow, it's frying well.
(With a pleasant sound, the pork cutlets are getting fried)

174
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,530
-Good. -I feel good.
(With a pleasant sound, the pork cutlets are getting fried)

175
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,940
No one is home, right?

176
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,140
(At this time, Hwi, Seongmin and Seungjin come home)
No one is home, right?

177
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,980
(At this time, Hwi, Seongmin and Seungjin come home)

178
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,020
No, I smell food.
(At this time, Hwi, Seongmin and Seungjin come home)

179
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,440
(At this time, Hwi, Seongmin and Seungjin come home)

180
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,030
Is it not?
(At this time, Hwi, Seongmin and Seungjin come home)

181
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,780
(At this time, Hwi, Seongmin and Seungjin come home)

182
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,150
What is this?

183
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,820
(Seongmin: Are you preparing (dinner)?)
(Minseon: How is it? Looks good, right?)

184
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,620
(Seungjin: Wow. You're making pork cutlets?)
(Minseon: It's done. Just have to fry them)

185
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,580
(Seungjin: Where did you go?)
(Minseon: We... what was it... water sports)

186
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:49,950
(Envious)

187
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,600
-Darn it. -Where?
(Envious)

188
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,850
-Nearby. -Yangpyeong Resort.
(Envious)

189
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,360
-Yangpyeong Resort? -Oh.

190
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,290
Oh, Yangpyeong.

191
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,600
(Myeongkyun: We are all drained now)
(Minseon: It was awesome. We almost flew out)

192
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,100
Can you see this?
(Myeongkyun: We are all drained now)
(Minseon: It was awesome. We almost flew out)

193
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,980
Can you see this?

194
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,710
(Tan lines according to the ride structures)
(Minseon: It was so crazy. We almost flew out)
Can you see this?

195
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,400
(Tan lines according to the ride structures)
(Minseon: It was so crazy. We almost flew out)

196
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,460
It must be fun.
(Tan lines according to the ride structures)
(Minseon: It was so crazy. We almost flew out)

197
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,740
(Minseon: Where did you go?)

198
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,260
(Hwi: We went bowling)

199
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,100
(Minseon: Bowling? So you went for bowling)

200
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,460
(Hwi: It was relaxing, since it was indoors)

201
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:15,940
You went bowling?

202
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,340
-Yes, we did. -It must be fun.

203
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,020
But all three of us were not good at it.

204
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,820
(Seongmin: Why are there only two of you?)
(Minseon: Everyone else is sleeping. After coming back)

205
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,140
(Seongmin: Because they're tired?)
(Minseon: Yeah)

206
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,000
(Youngjoon and Hanmin wake up because of the sounds outside)

207
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,340
What time is it?
(Youngjoon and Hanmin wake up because of the sounds outside)

208
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:32,860
(Youngjoon: Wow, we slept a lot)
(Hanmin: It's past 7)

209
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,180
(Youngjoon: We slept for about two hours)

210
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,220
(Hanmin: Are the others back?)

211
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,060
(Hwi heads to the single room to check on Jaeseung)

212
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,500
(Hwi: Oops. Are you sleeping?)
(Jaeseung: Yes)

213
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,780
(Hwi: Sorry, sorry)
(Jaeseung: It's okay. Come in)

214
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,620
(Hwi: I'm so tired)

215
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,740
(Jaeseung: Did you have fun?)

216
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,460
(Hwi: We went bowling)

217
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,260
Really?
(Hwi: We went bowling)

218
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,320
(Hwi: I’m so embarrassed)
Really?
(Hwi: We went bowling)

219
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,300
(Hwi: I’m so embarrassed)

220
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,130
Why?
(Hwi: I’m so embarrassed)

221
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,100
(Hwi: I’m so embarrassed)

222
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,340
All three of us didn't know how to bowl.

223
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,900
(Hwi tells Jaeseung about the day)
All three of us didn't know how to bowl.

224
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,040
Really?
(Hwi tells Jaeseung about the day)

225
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,310
It was a mess.
(Hwi tells Jaeseung about the day)

226
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,160
Seungjin throws the ball like this.
(Hwi tells Jaeseung about the day)

227
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,140
Really? But I bowl that way too.
(Hwi tells Jaeseung about the day)

228
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:10,740
(Hwi tells Jaeseung about the day)

229
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:16,700
(Hwi: Because I was annoyed by Jaeseung,)

230
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,700
(Hwi: I was avoiding Jaeseung and whatnot)

231
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:25,060
(Hwi: I felt bad, so I wanted to talk and reconcile with him)

232
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:30,740
(Hwi: So I approached him first to show my friendliness)

233
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,040
(Hwi: I heard you went for water sports)

234
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,060
Yeah, but I'll take that.
(Hwi: I heard you went for water sports)

235

236
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,100
(Jaeseung: Yeah, but... after some rides,)

237
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,180
(Jaeseung: I didn't feel too well)
(Hwi: What's wrong? Did you catch a cold?)

238
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,940
(Jaeseung: Yeah, it feels like a cold)

239
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,740
(Hwi: Did you take some medicine?)
(Jaeseung: Yeah I've been sleeping since I took the medicine)

240
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,340
(Hwi: Sleep more. Sorry for waking you up)

241
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,220
(Jaeseung: It's fine. I feel better after waking up)

242
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,980
(Jaeseung: I'm really fine now)

243
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:53,770
(Then I'll stay here)

244
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,930
My hair...
(Then I'll stay here)

245
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,820
(Then I'll stay here)

246
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,620
Really.
(Then I'll stay here)

247
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,180
Really.

248
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,150
(Putting aside the tension they share and feeling more at ease with each other)

249
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,310
Wait.
(Putting aside the tension they share and feeling more at ease with each other)

250
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,700
(Putting aside the tension they share and feeling more at ease with each other)

251
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,180
I'm tired too.

254
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,700
(Jaeseung: I think a lot of my tension with Hwi)

255
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,220
(Jaeseung: was relieved today)

256
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,140
(Jaeseung: I thought a lot at that time)

257
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,460
(Jaeseung: I need to talk to him more)

258
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,580
(Youngjoon: We slept for two hours)

259
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,380
(Youngjoon: I feel reborn)

260
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,500
(Myeongkyun: I really want to sleep now)

261
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,260
(Youngjoon: You should've taken a rest first)

262
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,820
(Myeongkyun: After showering, it so happened to be time to prepare dinner)

263
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,820
(Myeongkyun: But it was fun)

264
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,300
(Youngjoon: I kept hearing the sound of a hammer knocking)

265
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,660
(Myeongkyun: I was pounding it with my wrist snap. Thump, thump, thump)

266
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,780
(Myeongkyun: But Minseon is amazing to think of making pork cutlets himself)

267
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,540
(Myeongkyun: Look, he made 16 cutlets)

268
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,400
Yes. It must've been so much work.
(Myeongkyun: Look, he made 16 cutlets)

269
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,060
(Myeongkyun: Look, he made 16 cutlets)

270
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,180
(Youngjoon: We came to help, but all's done)

271

(Jaeseung feels much better after a nap)

272
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,620
(Knock knock)

273
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,300

274
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:05,820
-It's fine. Come in.

278
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,580
(Jaeseung: I don't feel well)
(Seongmin: What's wrong?)

279
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,460
((Worried) Seongmin: Are you okay?)
(Jaeseung: I think I caught a cold)

280
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,460
(Jaeseung: So I was just in bed after taking the medicine)

281
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,900
(Joking)
(Seongmin: Did you have a tough time? Is it because we're getting older?)

282
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,020
(So mean)

283
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,740
(Seongmin: You're the strongest man in Men's House)
(Jaeseung: What man?)

284
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,180
(Seongmin: The strongest man)

285
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,580
(Jaeseung: The strongest?)

286
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,860
(Jaeseung: But I feel much, much better now)
(Seongmin: Why?)

287
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:45,460
(Jaeseung: Actually, I was... I had a fever too)
(Seongmin: Oh...)

288
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,580
(Seongmin: Jaeseung, did you take this medicine?)
(Jaeseung: Yes)

289
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,100
(Seongmin: Must be tough to be sick. You need to recover)

290
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,440
But...
(Seongmin: Must be tough to be sick. You need to recover)

291
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:54,900
(Seongmin: Must be tough to be sick. You need to recover)

292
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,380
(Jaeseung: Also... Yesterday...)

293
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:03,780
(Jaeseung: I think I felt sorry towards Hwi)

294
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:10,540
(Jaeseung: I know it's nothing to be sorry about)

295
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,670
(Jaeseung: But I think I just felt bad)

296
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,830
I see.
(Jaeseung: But I think I just felt bad)

297
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,060
(Jaeseung: But I think I just felt bad)

298
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:24,540

299
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,500
(Jaeseung: I felt...)

300
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,500
(Jaeseung: It's hard for me to not be bothered)

301
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:35,980
(Seongmin: People are...)
(Jaeseung: Fickle)

302
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:41,980
(Seongmin: People are fickle, but I...)

303
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,780
(Seongmin: Anyway I'm leaning towards one person)

304
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:52,060
(Jaeseung: Seongmin was worried about how I felt and he tried to reassure me)

305
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,220
(Jaeseung: The way he was considerate about my feelings was very cute)

306

(Minseon: It's too embarrassing to read it beside him)
(Hwi: Okay, okay. See you later)

472
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,020
(Minseon: Of course I know who wrote the letter)

473

(Minseon: Gosh. It's so cute)

475
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:01,580

(To: Minseon
I’m surprised by new aspects of you every day. I realized your strengths and charms that I didn’t know about before. I’m sorry that I’m not good at expressing myself, but I had a lot of fun spending time with you. Let’s enjoy the remaining days even more.
From: Jo Myeongkyun)

478
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:21,540
(Myeonggyun carefully opens the letter)

479
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,740

480
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,940

(To: Myeongkyun
Hi :) Wasn’t today a really peaceful and enjoyable day? Just like you I wanted to go out and have fun, but I think I had more fun spending time with just you at home today. Thank you for today >< Didn’t you go out to talk with Youngjoon just now? You two said you’ve worked things out, but I think there must be stuff that’s still not clarified. I’m lying if I say I’m unbothered by it, haha, but if it makes you feel better, I think it’s good too. What I mean is that if you’re troubled, you can talk to me anytime. I’ll always listen to you :) In return, you can make me happier. You’ve done well throughout these days. Let’s spend the rest of the days happily :D
From: Minseon)

486

I especially missed you today!!! It’s been a while(?) since we were apart for so long… Haha. Every now and then, I get worried that I’m putting pressure on you because I think I like you more than you do :( Thank you for always being by my side and being my support.
From: Youngjoon)

492
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,020

I want to go on a date with you, but you seem to be only interested in Youngjoon, so I’m a bit apprehensive… It’s not quite a crush yet, but I want to get closer to you, so I’m writing this letter to you! Have a good night :)

504
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,940

Hyung! Hello, hehe. Who do you think I am? Hehe. It’s been a while since I’ve written a letter. It’s been a rollercoaster since I came into Men’s House… I’ve just been stressed out until today, where I had a relaxing and delicious dinner at the house. At first, I thought we only had similar-looking eyes and were different in every other aspect… Now I think I like your eyes that look like mine, and every other different aspect of you <3 (Ah!) It must be tough being at the single room alone… But you’ve always been in my heart!! Bye~~~

Hello, hyung. It’s a bit awkward since it’s my first time writing a letter… It’s already the fifth day. Time flies, doesn’t it? Many things have happened so far, but I’m really glad to have gotten along well with you. I’ve been overwhelmed with joy and sadness, so I’m mentally exhausted, but I’m surprised I still feel the same way. At first, I was just curious and interested, but now I really like you. At first, thanks to your warm words and expressions, I was just happy without worries. But seeing what you say to me and how you act towards me now, I’m always anxious. I have my mind set on you, but you’re unsure about your feelings for me, which really breaks my heart. But thank you for always being kind and comforting me when I’m having a tough time. Now I’m wondering if it’s even possible to date someone else other than you. It’s the first time I’m feeling this anxiety and desperate, so it’s nice too. Now I’m really not sure. I don’t want to be more troubled, but I’m frustrated by how my heart flutters and feels full when I’m around you. It’ll be the sixth day tomorrow. I’ve done everything I could to express my feelings for you, putting aside all my pride. So I hope you can make things clear with me now too. Anyway, thank you for coming into my life :)

00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,530
I need to go.

589
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:59,260
(Seongmin goes to the bathroom to hide his tears)

590
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:08,380
(Seongmin: I think I got agitated then)

591
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,620
(Seongmin: I was exhausted by the non-stop apologetic feelings)

592
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:18,260
(Seongmin: That's why I spoke harshly last night)

593
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:24,300
(Seongmin: Hwi must be suffering because of me)

594
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:30,860
(Seongmin: If I received the letter before that,)

595
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,780
(Seongmin: I should've been able to control my emotions better)

596
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,460
(Seongmin: I regret that)

597
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:46,550
(Youngjoon's excited to read the letter)

598
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,780
How can I read it beside you?
(Youngjoon's excited to read the letter)

599
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,430
How can I read it beside you?

600
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,580
(Youngjoon: The most memorable thing is)

601
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,020
(Youngjoon: when we made rings together...)

602
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,050
(To: Yeongjoon
I’m sure you’ve had a stressful time. Let’s go somewhere nice together for a date and have a therapeutic time <3 Rather than a letter, I want to have a chat with you at a café while eating yummy stuff. We must go on a date tomorrow!!
From: Hanmin)

603
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,940
We carved a 'heart icon' in them.

604
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,760
(Youngjoon: It was so cute that he drew it in the letter)
We carved a 'heart icon' in them.

605
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,940
(Youngjoon: It was so cute that he drew it in the letter)

606
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,660
(Youngjoon: So cute...)

607
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,620
(Youngjoon: I'm so happy)

608
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,820
(Youngjoon: It's cheesy stuff that isn't easy to say usually)

609
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:23,900
(Youngjoon: It can be expressed through a letter)

610
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,980
(Youngjoon: So I'm happy)

611
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,820
(Youngjoon: Why did Hanmin receive two letters?)

612
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,940
(Minseon: Go ask him)

613
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,740
(Youngjoon: I think Seungjin wrote it to him)
(Minseon: Right)

614
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,740
(Youngjoon: Because... You were there too. But in Hanmin's anonymous chat,)

615
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,660
(Youngjoon: someone said he wanted to go on a date with Hanmin)

616
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,460
(Youngjoon: He said he wasn't his type, but)

617
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,020
(Youngjoon: he couldn't finish his thoughts since time was up)

618
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,540
But...

619
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:51,620
(Youngjoon: It could just be a show of interest)
But...

620
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,020
(Youngjoon: It could just be a show of interest)

621
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,220
(Youngjoon: And I'm not really wary of it)

622
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:02,580
(Myeongkyun: It's also because Seungjin doesn't have someone he's 100% interested in)

623
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:07,580
(Youngjoon: What's interesting is the two in that double room received two letters each)

624
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:11,900
(Youngjoon: In this situation, who could've written to Hanmin? Is it 'Butane'?)

625
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,820
(Youngjoon: After thinking about it,)

626
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,980
(Youngjoon: who else without a partner was left?)

627
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,460
(Youngjoon: Then I thought of Seungjin)

628
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,940
(Youngjoon: So Seungjin's (anonymous chat name) was 'Butane')

629
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:25,620
-Gosh. -This is driving me crazy.

630
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,560
(Hanmin enters the quad room)
-Gosh. -This is driving me crazy.

631
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,920
(Hanmin enters the quad room)

632
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,030
-But he looks happy today. -Yeah.
(Hanmin enters the quad room)

633
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,320
(Youngjoon: I heard you received two letters)

634
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,020
-What? -I heard you received two letters.
(Youngjoon: I heard you received two letters)

635
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,650
-What? -I heard you received two letters.

636
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,900
(Hanmin: Don't read my letter)
(Youngjoon: I've read it)

637
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,780
(Hanmin: My letter's not good enough to be a letter...)

638
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:48,900
(Hanmin: You must've been sighing while reading it)

639
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,820
(Hanmin: Because I've never written a letter before)

640
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:57,100
(Hanmin: I suddenly thought of the letter Youngjoon wrote to me)

641
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,980
(Hanmin: The quality of my letter)

642
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:04,420
(Hanmin: was so terrible. So I felt bad and said sorry and asked him not to read it)

643
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:09,940
(Seungjin looks particularly lonely today)

644
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,860
(Seungjin: All my feelings were sorted out)

645
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:17,300
(Seungjin: after I wrote the letter, before going to bed)

646
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,580
(Seungjin: Sigh...)

647
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,420
(Seungjin: If I knew this is how I'd feel,)

648
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,420
(Seungjin: I wouldn't have sent a letter to Hanmin)

649
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:27,540
(Seungjin: At that moment, I really wanted to hide)

650
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:31,540
(Seungjin: First of all, it has happened)

651
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,140
(Seungjin: I'm glad I could express my feelings)

652
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,060
(Seungjin: even a little)

653
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,260
(Minseon reads Myeongkyun's letter again)

654
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:46,100
(Myeongkyun: Reading it again?)
(Minseon: Yes)

655
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,700
(Minseon: I don't know how many times I'll read it while I'm here)

656
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:53,460
(Minseon: Will I read it ten times? 50 times? 100 times?)

657
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,780
(Minseon: I have to read it 200 times)

658
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:01,740
(Minseon: Well, it's very cute. I'm so happy)

659
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,380
(Minseon: I can't help reading it again and again)

660
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,780
(Minseon: I smiled a lot while reading it)

661
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,460
(Caressing his head)
(Minseon: You did well today)

662
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,060
(Myeongkyun: I have to make stir-fried sausages with vegetables later)

663
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,940
(Minseon: Oh, really? I'll help you)

664
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,500
(Hanmin: Where do you want to be at?)

665
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,120
(Hwi: Seungjin and I will lie by the pool)

666
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,240
Why?
(Hwi: Seungjin and I will lie by the pool)

667
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,860
What? Nothing.
(Hwi: Seungjin and I will lie by the pool)

668
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,310
(To avoid the rain, Hwi and Seungjin head to the entertainment room)

669
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,240
Let's stay here.
(To avoid the rain, Hwi and Seungjin head to the entertainment room)

670
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:33,490
(To avoid the rain, Hwi and Seungjin head to the entertainment room)

671
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,790
Let's stay here then.
(To avoid the rain, Hwi and Seungjin head to the entertainment room)

672
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,180
(Youngjoon: I don't feel wary of him)

673
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:47,820
(Youngjoon: But I'm slightly bothered when I see Seungjin)

674
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:52,150
(Youngjoon: At least 1% of discomfort)

675
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,150
That's all.
(Youngjoon: At least 1% of discomfort)

676
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:53,700
(Youngjoon: At least 1% of discomfort)

677
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,100
(Youngjoon: What do you think?)
(Hwi: So pretty)

678
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:01,700
(Youngjoon: I'm making them based on the dates or which day it was)

679
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:06,100
(Hwi: Nice. It must be cute)

680
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,020
Where did you take this?

681
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,320
(While decorating the album, they reminisce about their time here)
Where did you take this?

682
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,270
-At home? -Yeah, there.
(While decorating the album, they reminisce about their time here)

683
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:10,890
(While decorating the album, they reminisce about their time here)

684
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:15,100
The photos taken at home are divided into a separate group.
(While decorating the album, they reminisce about their time here)

685
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:15,770
The photos taken at home are divided into a separate group.

686
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,860
(Hwi: With the photos we took during this time,)

687
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:27,180
(Hwi: we decorated the album together. It was a good time to organize my memories)

688
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:32,020
(Hwi: I want to draw)

689
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:40,860
(Focused)

690
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:58,620
(Hwi fills the canvas in a blink of an eye)

691
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:05,860
(What's the meaning of Hwi's drawing?)

692
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:13,580
(Hwi goes somewhere with the finished drawing)

693
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:19,340
(Hwi: I drew something)
(Seongmin: Drawing?)

694
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,219
(Seongmin: Let me see)

695
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,020
(Seongmin: How did you draw this?)

696
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,100
(Hwi: I usually give drawings to my friends during birthdays)

697
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,500
(Hwi: Since it’s your birthday soon, I just drew one simply)

698
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,650
(Hwi: I drew it with crayons)
(Seongmin: It's so pretty)

699
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,270
Behind...
(Hwi: I drew it with crayons)
(Seongmin: It's so pretty)

700
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,460
(Hwi: I drew it with crayons)
(Seongmin: It's so pretty)

701
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:42,780
(Seongmin: I felt thankful and sorry)

702
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,860
(Seongmin: So I didn't ask him what his drawing meant)

703
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:53,980
(Seongmin: Gosh... I feel so bad...)

704
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:02,060
(Hwi: I extinguished the sparks myself,)

705
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,300
(Hwi: but even if the sparks are gone, the ashes remain)

706
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:11,060
(Hwi: I think I still have those good memories to keep)

707
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,900
(Seongmin: Now that it's the last day, I don't want to leave)

708
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,540
(Hwi: I really don't want to leave)

709
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,740
(Hwi: I've gotten close to everyone)

710
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,300
(Myeongkyun: In a blink of an eye)

711
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,220
(Seungjin: Tomorrow you all... wait, why did I speak so informally)

712
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:23,380
-I sometimes speak that way too. -Just drop the formalities.

713
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,870
(They can't fall asleep as they're sad it's over)
-I sometimes speak that way too. -Just drop the formalities.

714
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,530
I addressed people informally by accident too.
(They can't fall asleep as they're sad it's over)

715
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,380
(They can't fall asleep as they're sad it's over)

716
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:33,860
(The last night in Men's House)

717
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,860
(Jaeseung: Let's talk for a while)
(Hwi. What?)

718
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,460
(Jaeseung: Let's talk)
(Hwi: Okay)

719
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,700
-What? -Nothing.

720
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,260
(Hwi: I thought it was time)

721
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,700
(Hwi: Because I have to talk with Jaeseung once no matter what)

722
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,660
(Hwi: So I followed him immediately)

723
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:55,700
(Jaeseung: Gosh... Where should I start?)

724
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,300
(Jaeseung: I really have no idea)

725
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,580
(Jaeseung: I'll cut to the chase)

726
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,100
(Jaeseung: I hope we can have an honest conversation)

727
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,500
(Nodding)

728
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,780
(Jaeseung: You, me, and Seongmin were sort of)

729
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:18,820
(Jaeseung: in a love triangle)

730
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:27,500
(Jaeseung: I was jealous of you to some degree)

731
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:35,220
(Jaeseung: I made you and Seongmin become roommates)

732
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,820
(Jaeseung: You two were my first and second choices)

733
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:43,020
(Jaeseung: When I saw you guys go on a date,)

734
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:50,460
(Jaeseung: I guess I was jealous)

735
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,900
(Jaeseung: When I think of (Hwi), I have mixed feelings)

736
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:00,260
(Jaeseung: I was interested in (Hwi) initially)

737
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,220
(Jaeseung: But from a certain moment,)

738
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:09,500
(Jaeseung: we became rivals competing for Seongmin's affection)

739
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:16,860
(Jaeseung: Actually, I first want to know...)

740
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:22,180
(Jaeseung: if you wrote a question to me)
(Hwi: A question?)

741
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,180
(Jaeseung: The (truth game) anonymous question)

742
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:30,060
(Thinking)

743
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:38,580
(Jaeseung: I think you directed that question to me)
(Hwi: What question?)

744
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:43,940
(Jaeseung: The question, "Are you sure about how you feel towards Seongmin?")
(Hwi: I feel so wronged)

745
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,900
(Jaeseung: Didn't you ask it?)

746
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,860
(Hwi: After hearing that question, everyone looked at me)

747
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,900
(Hwi: But it really wasn't me)
(Jaeseung: It wasn't you?)

748
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,700
(Hwi: I said it just now, but it was written by someone else)

749
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,260
(Hwi: I can't tell you who it is)

750
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,340
(Hwi: But it really wasn't me)

751
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:04,020
(Jaeseung: When Hwi said it wasn't him,)

752
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:09,300
(Jaeseung: I felt so confused)

753
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,300
(Hwi: But it really wasn't me)

754
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,460
(Hwi: I felt so wronged)

755
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,020
(Jaeseung: So I can trust you now)
(Hwi: Seriously)

756
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:20,820
(Jaeseung: Since you said that, I can trust you)

757
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,380
(Jaeseung: Since then, I guess...)

758
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:31,500
(Jaeseung: Right. From then on, I felt hostile towards you)

759
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,940
(Jaeseung: It started then)

760
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,540
(Jaeseung: Now that I think about it,)

761
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:41,940
(Jaeseung: I felt like you were going too far by pushing me to a dead end)

762
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,220
(Hwi: If I were you, if I was asked that question,)

763
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,900
(Hwi: I'd think it was me too)

764
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:57,060
(Hwi: When I heard it, I thought you'd assume it was me)

765
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:06,260
(Jaeseung: I misunderstood you. I'm really sorry)

766
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:11,500
(Hwi: No. I'm just sad)

767
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,300
(Hwi: If, well...)

768
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:19,780
(Hwi: If it weren't for that question and you didn't misunderstand me,)

769
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:23,380
(Hwi: things might've been different between us)

770
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,100
(Hwi: That's a bit of a shame)

771
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:31,260
(Hwi: I didn't think...)

772
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,220
(Hwi: you'd misunderstand me like this)

773
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:37,420
(Hwi: I didn't expect you to think it was me)

774
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,700
(Hwi: I had feelings for you too)

775
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,300
(Hwi: There's no reason to push you to a dead end)

776
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:51,740
(Jaeseung: When we were playing the truth game, you said you were only interested in one person)
(Hwi: Yeah)

777
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:57,020
(Hwi: It’s not like that. It’s just someone I wanted to know more)
(Jaeseung: Yeah?)

778
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:01,300
(Hwi: At that time, Seongmin was my first choice too)

779
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,820
(Hwi: No matter what, you were my second choice)

780
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:09,900
(Jaeseung: Right. I thought that way too)

781
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:16,140
(Hwi: So when I saw you with Seongmin,)

782
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:20,100
(Hwi: my heart hurt...)

783
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,940
(Hwi: But no matter what,)

784
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:27,140
(Hwi: I still like Seongmin the most)

785
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:31,220
(Hwi: So I hoped Seongmin can be happy)

786
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,620
(Hwi: as much as possible. So...)

787
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:39,420
(Hwi: I respected his time with you)

788
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,900
(Hwi: Yes, I just wanted Seongmin to be happy)

789
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,950
Right.

790
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:52,580
(Hwi: It took me a lot to finally figure this out)

791
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,980
(Hwi: I had a tough time pondering about this)

792
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,780
(Hwi: Being here, it's my first time realizing I'm such a crybaby)

793
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:02,020
(Hwi: I really cried a lot here)

794
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:12,660
(Hwi: Anyway, you must be happy now too)

795
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,020
(Nodding)

796
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:21,020
(Jaeseung: But I don't feel good)

797
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:26,340
(Jaeseung: The happiness I have was obtained)

798
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:33,820
(Jaeseung: by taking someone else's happiness away)

799
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,220
(Jaeseung: It hurts me when I think about this)

800
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:43,700
(Jaeseung: Because I took away your happiness. That's why it hurts me more)

801
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:49,420
(Jaeseung: If we had more conversations,)

802
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:53,500
(Jaeseung: I wouldn't have misunderstood you)

803
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,900
(Hwi: It's a pity about that)

804
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:05,460
(Jaeseung: After leaving here, we must be good friends)

805
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:10,420
(Hwi: I'd be happy if we could. Really)

806
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,900
(Jaeseung: We've both had a tough time. Let's share a hug)

807
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:20,110
(I'm really sorry)

808
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:22,760
I'm really sorry. Really.
(I'm really sorry)

809
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,930
(They hug each other tightly)

810
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,160
I'm really sorry.
(They hug each other tightly)

811
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,980
(They hug each other tightly)

812
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,980
(Jaeseung: I'm really sorry, you know?)

813
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:39,500
(Jaeseung: After we leave here, I'll buy you drinks)

814
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:45,540
(Hwi: Buy me croffles. Make me croffles)
(Jaeseung: Okay. You have to visit me)

815
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:50,660
(They finally feel much better now)

816
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:57,300
(Hwi: The door signs where our names are written...)

817
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,500
(Single room: Jaeseung)
(Hwi: When we were writing that,)

818
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:05,300
(Hwi: I didn’t expect this would happen)
(Jaeseung: Me too)

819
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,140
(Hwi: I wrote them all)

820
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:14,420
(Hwi: Even if we leave here, I want to have fun like I did back then)

821
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,940
(Hwi: As close friends)

822
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:22,500
(Jaeseung: Really... We must keep in touch)

823
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,980
(Hwi: Let's stop crying)

824
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,020
(Hwi: I'm all cried out. I've cried too many times)

825
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:34,540
(Jaeseung: I won't cry anymore after this)

826
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:38,340
(Hwi: Thank you for talking to me first)

827
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:41,140
(Jaeseung: Thank you for being honest with me)

828
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:46,460
(Jaeseung: Thank you for being understanding too)

829
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,820
(Jaeseung: Let's go down)

830
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:53,460
(Hwi: Ah, seriously...)

831
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,420
(Hwi: Both of us are crying. What are we doing?)

832
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:04,020
(Jaeseung: I want to drink some water)
(Hwi: How about a toast together?)

833
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,700
(Jaeseung: Is it okay to drink now?)

834
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:10,220
(Hwi: I think I can talk to you comfortably now)
(Jaeseung: Seriously...)

835
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:13,380
(Hwi: You'd always been cold to me)

836
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:17,060
(Jaeseung: No...)
((Tearing up) Hwi: Seriously...)

837
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:23,980
(Feeling wrong, Hwi explodes in tears)

838
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:28,780
(Hwi: You were so hostile even when I tried to talked to you)

839
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:31,180
(Hwi: Seriously...)

840
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:37,020
(Jaeseung: I'm sorry)
(Hwi: Let's have some water)

841
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,100
(Hwi: Ah, whatever. I want water)

842
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,300
(There's no water)

843
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:48,180
(Hwi: What do you want to drink? An energy drink?)

844
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,310
(Hwi: Do you want an energy drink?)

845
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:51,890
Ah, gosh.
(Hwi: Do you want an energy drink?)

846
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:52,540
(Hwi: Do you want an energy drink?)

847
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,620
(Jaeseung: I'm really sorry)

848
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:58,300
(Jaeseung: I'm really sorry)

849
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,100
(Jaeseung: I'm really sorry)

850
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:06,020
(Jaeseung: Really...)

851
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:12,300
(Hwi: But it's a relief. Cheers)

852
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:22,740
(They let out all their suppressed feelings)

853
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:32,660
(Hwi: Seriously... Why am I crying again?)

854
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:47,300
(Jaeseung goes to the pool to hide his tears)

855
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,140
(Hwi: It’s raining outside)

856
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:52,220
(Hwi: Oh, my slippers are here)

857
00:45:54,020 --> 00:46:03,020
(Jaeseung can't stop crying because he feels sorry towards Hwi)

858
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:08,380
(Hwi: What’s wrong?)

859
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:11,540
(Jaeseung: When I saw you cry, I felt really bad)

860
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:17,060
(Hwi: Both of us are crybabies)

861
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,650
Gosh.

862
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:26,180
(Jaeseung: I didn't mean to be hostile)

863
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:37,980
(Minseon: Jaeseung cries more than I thought)

864
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:42,380
(Minseon: Ah... Will I cry that much when I get older?)

865
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:48,370
(Hwi: Seriously. Why are you crying in front of someone younger like a fool?)

866
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:49,570
I know.
(Hwi: Seriously. Why are you crying in front of someone younger like a fool?)

867
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:50,720
Really.
(Hwi: Seriously. Why are you crying in front of someone younger like a fool?)

868
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,220
(Hwi: Seriously. Why are you crying in front of someone younger like a fool?)

869
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:53,260
(Jaeseung: Are you ten plus years younger than me?)

870
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:56,140
(Hwi: I'm 11 years younger than you)

871
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:00,580
(Hwi: Why are you crying in front of someone 11 years younger thank you?)

872
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:11,220
(Jaeseung: Can we get used to it after returning to our daily lives?)

873
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,860
(Jaeseung: Come to Daejeon when you're free)

874
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:18,060
(Hwi: You should come to Seoul too. Don't you have a car?)

875
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:22,460
(Jaeseung: Even if I have a car, I take a train when I go to Seoul)
(Hwi: Why?)

876
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:27,540
(Hwi: I don't even have a driver's license)
(Jaeseung: It's tiring to drive to Seoul)

877
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,860
(Hwi: My heart fluttered when you gave me personal training)
(Jaeseung: What?

878
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:33,180
(Hwi: During the personal training session)
(Jaeseung: Oh!)

879
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,780
(Jaeseung: You were complaining about how tired you were)

880
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:38,380
(Hwi: When I was doing squats, you told me to look up, so I looked up)

881
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,780
(Hwi: But your eyes are right in front of me. How can I look at you?)

882
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,940
Pft.
(Hwi: But your eyes are right in front of me. How can I look at you?)

883
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,540
(Hwi: But your eyes are right in front of me. How can I look at you?)

884
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:48,940
(Jaeseung: I'm speechless)

885
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:57,500
(Also, can you smile at me when you look at me?)

886
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:57,970
(Choking up again)

887
00:47:57,970 --> 00:47:59,150
Seriously.
(Choking up again)

888
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:01,380
(What's wrong)

889
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:06,700
(Hwi: When you look at me, you never smile at me)

890
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:13,620
(Jaeseung: This is very hard to say)

891
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:20,460
(Jaeseung: Seriously... What's all this?)

892
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,860
(Hwi: I know, right?)

893
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:29,100
(Hwi: It's not wrong that Jaeseung likes Seongmin)

894
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,900
(Hwi: But I thought of Jaeseung too negatively then)

895
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:37,460
(Hwi: I think I can be close friends with me now)

896
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:41,300
(Jaeseung: I wanted to do have a friendly competition,)

897
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:46,340
(Jaeseung: but because of my misunderstanding, I was too hostile towards him)

898
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,180
(Jaeseung: I'm really sorry about that)

899
00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:02,300
(Minseon: It's all in the past, but I think I should talk about it)

900
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,500
(Minseon: I'm fine now)

901
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,620
(Minseon: But when we had the anonymous chats,)

902
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:09,940
(Minseon: to check the 'Why Are You Like This' nickname,)

903
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:12,430
(Minseon: I went into Hanmin's chat)

904
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:14,490
But in a way...
(Minseon: I went into Hanmin's chat)

905
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:19,620
(Minseon: I knew 'Why Are You Like This' was you)
(Youngjoon: That's right. We both knew)

906
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,980
(Minseon: I realized at that time)

907
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,260
(Minseon: But when I didn't know who it was,)

908
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,420
(Minseon: before I went into Hanmin's chat to confirm,)

909
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,340
(Minseon: when you two were talking in Myeongkyun's anonymous chat,)

910
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:33,100
(Minseon: I was a bit annoyed)

911
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:36,420
(Minseon: I went in to talk to him...)
(Youngjoon: Yes, you didn't have a chance to talk)

912
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,820
(Minseon: Yes. I couldn't say anything,)

913
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:40,940
(Minseon: but you and Myeongkyun kept talking,)

914
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:43,740
(Minseon: I was a bit annoyed. I thought I should tell you)

915
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:46,060
(Minseon: Anyone could tell I was annoyed)

916
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:49,100
(Minseon: But I still think it's better not to hide it)

917
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,020
(Minseon: That's why I wanted to talk to you)

918
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:55,020
(Youngjoon: I wanted to clarify things with Myeongkyun)

919
00:49:55,020 --> 00:50:00,580
(Youngjoon: as I couldn't understand his intentions for saying those stuff. I wanted him to clarify them)

920
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,860
(Youngjoon: I felt sorry towards you too,)

921
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:07,540
(Youngjoon: but that was the only chance I had)
(Minseon: Right, right)

922
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,660
(Youngjoon: So I had to take the chance)

923
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:13,100
(Minseon: So I was annoyed because it was something)

924
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,060
(Minseon: between you two,)

925
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,200
(Minseon: but you kept talking about it despite knowing I was there)

926
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,940
You know I'm in the chat room, but you still say it. What else?
(Minseon: but you kept talking about it despite knowing I was there)

927
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:18,100
(Minseon: I felt... like I was being belittled)
You know I'm in the chat room, but you still say it. What else?
(Minseon: but you kept talking about it despite knowing I was there)

928
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,500
(Minseon: I felt... like I was being belittled)

929
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,540
(Minseon: That's why I was annoyed)

930
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,940
(Youngjoon: But because you were in the anonymous chat, I thought)

931
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,980
(Youngjoon: you should know everything too)

932
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,900
(Youngjoon: That way, you can develop your relationship)

933
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,780
(Youngjoon: without having distrust)

934
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:40,180
(Youngjoon: Then can you know how you feel towards each other)
(Minseon: Yes, to know exactly...)

935
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,700
(Minseon: I should consider that seriously too)

936
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,100
(Youngjoon: Because after that, as I was frustrated,)

937
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,820
(Youngjoon: I kept fighting with Myeongkyun. But you'd still be in the loop)

938
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:47,940
(Youngjoon: I'm sure you'd be so clueless and curious)

939
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,940
(Youngjoon: If you didn't know what was going on)

940
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,100
(Youngjoon: So...

941
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,220
(Minseon: But I kept it in the whole time)

942
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:59,980
(Minseon: If you know I felt this way...)

943
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:03,940
(Youngjoon: Of course, no matter who it was)
(Minseon: I just wanted to tell you how I felt)

944
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,460
(Minseon: Since we're close now, so I wanted to talk about it)

945
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:10,140
(Youngjoon: I've also always been thinking about that)

946
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,940
(Youngjoon: Since we both know about it)
(Minseon: Yes)

947
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,060
(Minseon: Youngjoon and I are good now)

948
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,540
(Minseon: It'll be like this in the future too)

949
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:20,500
(Minseon: So rather than being frustrated alone,)

950
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:25,180
(Minseon: I wanted to tell Youngjoon about it)

951
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:28,900
(Youngjoon: I wasn't brave enough to talk to him about it first)

952
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,500
(Youngjoon: Am I not mature enough? Even though I'm older than him?)

953
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:36,260
(Youngjoon: It made me reflect on myself)

954
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:42,020
(Hwi: But after talking to Jaeseung,)

955
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,460
(Hwi: I feel much better)

956
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:48,180
(Hwi: I feel relaxed and happy now)

957
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:59,580
(Hwi: So I asked Jaeseung to come to Seoul to hang out)

958
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:03,700
(Seungjin: We can go to Seoul together)

959
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:13,300
(Hwi: We also talked about this, but when Jaeseung was 20, I was in fourth grade)

960
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:19,660
(Hwi: What am I doing with him now?)

961
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:24,740
(After talking to Jaeseung, Hwi feels much better)

962
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:30,620
(And... Seungjin is unusually quiet)

963
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,810
I feel dizzy.

964
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,660
(Seungjin: I have something to tell you...)
(Hwi:You can say it now)

965
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:42,060
(What does Seungjin want to say?)

966
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:48,860
(Seungjin: I really wanted to go home before)

967
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,620
(Seungjin: I only felt it today)

968
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:54,980
(Seungjin: that I'd be sad for it to end here)

969
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:58,700
(Seungjin: It's the first time I feel this way)

970
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:04,260
(Seungjin carefully speaks his mind)

971
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:10,980
(Seungjin: After our date yesterday,)

972
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:16,100
(Seungjin: I really wanted to go straight home)

973
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:21,060
(Seungjin: Yesterday was really perfect to me)
(Hwi: It was really great)

974
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,860
(Hwi: It was really great)

975
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:30,700
(Seungjin: Of how the moments I spent here,)

976
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:35,580
(Seungjin: this was the one that made my heart flutter)

977
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:42,980
(Seungjin: I think I made a true friend, so... I was really happy)

978
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:47,660
(Hwi: Yes, me too. Really...)

979
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:54,430
(Hwi: You’ve been comforting me all the time)

980
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:55,650
Yes.
(Hwi: You’ve been comforting me all the time)

981
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:01,340
(Seungjin: Only now did I realize that)

982
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:05,100
(Seungjin: I needed someone to comfort me)

983
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:09,420
(Seungjin: by telling me that I did well for the day too)

984
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,220
(Seungjin: In such a space,)

985
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,020
(Seungjin: of course it's not just me, but it's very unfamiliar)

986
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:20,020
(Seungjin: It was a lot for me to handle)

987
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:32,220
(Seungjin can't continue)

988
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:37,980
(Startled)

989
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:42,300
(Hwi: Why are you crying?)

990
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:47,020
(To the end, Seungjin couldn't speak his mind)

991
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:50,700
(Hwi: I've never seen Seungjin cry. I was flustered too)

992
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:55,700
(Hwi: I kept comforting him by his side)

993
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:03,140
(How does Seungjin feel now?)

994
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:04,520
Seriously.
(How does Seungjin feel now?)

995
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,980
(How does Seungjin feel now?)

996
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:11,460
(It's the last night, but the men are still confused)

997
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,240
What should I do?

998
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:13,340
What should I do? Isn't my suitcase too small and pathetic?

999
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:16,100
(Men are packing up in Men's House)
What should I do? Isn't my suitcase too small and pathetic?

1000
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:19,160
Isn't my suitcase too small and pathetic?
(Men are packing up in Men's House)

1001
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:21,900
(Myeongkyun: It's really small)
(Minseon: Right?)

1002
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:27,500
(Myeongkyun: You always say it's small. Turns out it's really small)
(Minseon: It's really small)

1003
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,900
(Minseon: I can't believe I'd open my suitcase again)

1004
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,140
(Myeongkyun: Yes, this day came too soon)

1005
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:35,780
(Seongmin: Let's pack up quickly)

1006
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:39,460
(Seongmin: When can we sleep? Goodness)

1007
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:43,540
(Sigh)
(Hanmin: Is this for real?)

1008
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,380
(Hanmin: Is it really the end?)

1009
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:57,420
(It's time to say goodbye)

1010
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:02,420
(Hwi: Gosh, what a sea of tears)

1011
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:03,620
(Crying)

1012
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:09,060
(Hwi's concerned as Seungjin can't stop crying)

1013
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:15,180
(Hwi: Seungjin crying)

1014
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,620
(Click)

1015
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:19,900
(Hwi: It even looks good)

1016
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,140
(Hwi: Look at this)

1017
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:22,540
So annoying!

1018
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:24,120
(Hwi teases Seungjin)
So annoying!

1019
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:27,900
(Hwi teases Seungjin)

1020
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,530
(Cries... So annoying...)

1021
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:32,600
So annoying.
(Cries... So annoying...)

1022
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:37,980
(Cries... So annoying...)

1023
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:50,780
(Does Hwi know why Seungjin's crying?)

1024
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,140
(Hwi: Let’s have some water)

1025
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:57,340
(Hwi: Let's toast each other)

1026
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,980
(Sigh...)

1027
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:05,380
(I'm so freaking angry)

1028
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:07,580
Hurry and have some water.

1029
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:14,260
(Hwi: Have some water and calm down)

1030
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:22,820
(Seungjin bursts into tears again)

1031
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:29,300
(Hwi stays silently by Seungjin's side)

1032
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:37,260
(Seungjin: No one knows how exhausted I am)
(Hwi: I know)

1033
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:40,140
(Seungjin: Don't say anything)

1034
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,060
(Haha)

1035
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:49,260
(Seungjin's complicated feelings are hard to describe)

1036
00:57:54,820 --> 00:58:00,420
(Crying)

1037
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:09,420
(Seungjin: I'll go back to my room and cry)
(Hwi: Are you going back to your room?)

1038
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,580
(Hwi: Should I not follow you?)
(Seungjin: Suit yourself)

1039
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:13,860
(Hwi: Should I go back to my room?)

1040
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:21,860
(Crying)

1041
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:29,340
(Hwi can't leave because he's worried about Seungjin)

1042
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,740
(He can't calm down because of his intense feelings)

1043
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:32,830
Gosh.
(He can't calm down because of his intense feelings)

1044
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:38,540
(He can't calm down because of his intense feelings)

1045
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:42,180
(So annoying)

1046
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:49,820
(Is it too late for Seungjin to confess his feelings?)

1047
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:53,140
(The last morning at Men's House)

1048
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:54,620
Please write down the name of the man you like the most.

1049
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:57,860
(The men will make their last confession)
Please write down the name of the man you like the most.

1050
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:01,700
(Youngjoon: The man I like the most is...)

1051
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,100
(Seungjin: You are...)

1052
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:08,380
(Like a snowman in the desert)

1053
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:10,940
(Thank you for everything)

1054
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,620
(I'll wait for you)

1055
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:22,500
(Seongmin: The situation where I feel like the bad guy)

1056
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:26,260
(Seongmin: keeps repeating. I'm tired)

1057
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:32,820
