00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,420
(In a hurry)

157
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,140
(Hwi: I came as soon as I heard the commotion.
Youngjoon: You should be happy with it.)

158
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,060
(Hwi: What is it?)

159
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,140
(Youngjoon: The date is decided based on the mailbox yesterday.)

160
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,620
(Oh!)

161
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:09,820
(Hwi: Really?
Youngjoon: What are you going to do? There's Jaeseung.)

162
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,650
Really?
(Hwi: Really?
Youngjoon: What are you going to do? There's Jaeseung.)

163
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,620
-What are you going to do? There's Jaeseung.
-Right.
(Hwi: Really?
Youngjoon: What are you going to do? There's Jaeseung.)

164
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:12,650
(Hwi: How did it turn out like this?)
-What are you going to do? There's Jaeseung.
-Right.
(Hwi: Really?
Youngjoon: What are you going to do? There's Jaeseung.)

165
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,820
(Hwi: How did it turn out like this?)

166
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:14,950
(Hwi: The three of us (Hwi & Seongmin & Seungjin) get along really well.)

167
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,060
Because the three of us get along really well.
(Hwi: The three of us (Hwi & Seongmin & Seungjin) get along really well.)

168
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,860
(Hwi: Put aside my own interest,)

169
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,260
(Hwi: I thought it was great.)

170
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,140
(Wow)

171
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,940
(Minseon: Seungjin, it's 9:30 a.m.)

172
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,540
(Why is it 9:30?)

173
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,340
(Minseon: Anyway...)

174
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,860
(Minseon: Myeongkyun!)

175
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,100
(Minseon: You can go (on a date) with me today.
Myeongkyun: Really? What's going on?)

176
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,299
My name is with yours.

177
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,020
(Gets up)
My name is with yours.

178
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,220
Who is mine?

179
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,840
(Seungjin: Who is my (date)?)
Who is mine?

180
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,380
The person who put the letter into the right mailbox. Seongmin, Hwi, and you.
(Seungjin: Who is my (date)?)

181
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,880
(It's time to get up, Seungjin)
(Minseon: The person who put the letter into the right mailbox. Seongmin, Hwi, and you.)
The person who put the letter into the right mailbox. Seongmin, Hwi, and you.

182
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,660
It's time to get up, Seongmin– Seungjin.
(It's time to get up, Seungjin)
(Minseon: The person who put the letter into the right mailbox. Seongmin, Hwi, and you.)

183
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,160
(It's time to get up, Seungjin) (Seungjin: Who am I going on a date with?)
It's time to get up, Seongmin– Seungjin.

184
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,260
-Who am I going on a date with?
-Not sure, you have to decide.
(It's time to get up, Seungjin) (Seungjin: Who am I going on a date with?)

185
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,340
(Youngjoon: Seungjin, Hwi, and Seongmin. The three of you.)

186
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,660
(Huh?)

187
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,650
If you put it in the opposite direction...

188
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,260
Ah it's possible.

189
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:02,960
(Ah it's not true!)
Ah it's possible.

190
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,430
(Ah it's not true!)

191
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,860
But it's raining heavily outside.
(Ah it's not true!)

192
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,420
But it's raining heavily outside.

193
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,060
(Seungjin: Gosh, I'm so sleepy.)

194
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,020
(Minseon: You'll feel better after washing up.)

195
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,940
(Seungjin: Seriously...)

196
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,180
(I almost swore)

197
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:26,500
(Jaeseung is late to the first floor)

198
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,340
(Staring)

199
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,500
(Jaeseung: Many people put the letter in the left mailbox.)

200
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,540
(After seeing the mission card, Jaeseung has more thoughts.)

201
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,420
(Jaeseung: It's interesting.)

202
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,420
(Jaeseung: Really interesting.)

203
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,300
(Jaeseung: It's so interesting I'm getting goosebumps.)

204
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,180
(Jaeseung: To be honest, I was a little annoyed.)

205
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,500
(Jaeseung: What others can get easily,)

206
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,980
(Jaeseung: why is it so hard when it comes to me?)

207
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,340
(Jaeseung: I felt like I'm really unlucky.)

208
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,060
(Seongmin just washed up)

209
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,300
(Hwi: Did you see it (the mission card)?
Seongmin: See what?)

210
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,020
I don't know. They told me you, me, and Seungjin...
(Hwi: Did you see it (the mission card)?
Seongmin: See what?)

211
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,770
(Hwi: They told me you, me, and Seungjin... and then the others will go on a date.)
I don't know. They told me you, me, and Seungjin...

212
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,770
and then the others will go on a date.
(Hwi: They told me you, me, and Seungjin... and then the others will go on a date.)

213
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,220
(Seongmin finally sees the mission card)

214
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,220
(Haa...)
(Seongmin: I was in a bad mood.)

215
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,940
(Seongmin: I just thought "I can't go on a date with Jaeseung" again.)

216
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:52,340
(Seongmin: And on top of that, it has to be with Hwi, whom I'm in an awkward situation with right now.)

217
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,620
(Seongmin: What should I do?)

218
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,740
(The men in the four bed room getting ready for the date)

219
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,180
(Minseon: Should I wear jeans too?)

220
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:01,250
(Youngjoon: Jeans sound good. It will go well with the rainbow top.)

221
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,520
Jeans sound good.
(Youngjoon: Jeans sound good. It will go well with the rainbow top.)

222
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,050
-It will go well with the rainbow top.
-Right?
(Youngjoon: Jeans sound good. It will go well with the rainbow top.)

223
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,780
(Myeongkyun: Light or dark jeans?)

224
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:12,070
(Youngjoon: What are you wearing on top? What you're wearing now?)

225
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,060
-Left...
-Let me see. Put them together.
(Youngjoon: What are you wearing on top? What you're wearing now?)

226
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,780
(Youngjoon: Let me see. Put them together.)
-Left...
-Let me see. Put them together.

227
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,100
(Youngjoon: Either they're the same tone, or if not,)

228
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,420
(Youngjoon: wear a different color.)

229
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:18,550
(Youngjoon: Both are different.
Myeongkyun. Is this one better?)

230
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,060
-Both are different.
-Is this one better?
(Youngjoon: Both are different.
Myeongkyun. Is this one better?)

231
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,700
(Youngjoon: Yeah.)

232
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,860
(Myeongkyun: What shoes should I wear?
Youngjoon: Sneakers.)

233
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:32,380
(Youngjoon: But if the pants are slim cut, black sneakers are good too.)

234
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:32,620
My attitude towards Myeongkyun...

235
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,020
(Youngjoon: My attitude towards Myeongkyun... Even if I deliberately pick a fight)
My attitude towards Myeongkyun...

236
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,340
Even if I deliberately pick a fight,
(Youngjoon: My attitude towards Myeongkyun... Even if I deliberately pick a fight)

237
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:36,510
(Youngjoon: it's just a quibble. Something very light.)
Even if I deliberately pick a fight,
(Youngjoon: My attitude towards Myeongkyun... Even if I deliberately pick a fight)

238
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,820
(Youngjoon: it's just a quibble. Something very light.)

239
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,300
(Youngjoon: I wouldn't be like super frustrated like I was previously. I felt that myself.)

240
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,060
(Youngjoon: At least I feel like it has gotten comfortable between us.)

241
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,100
(As expected, I expected it)

242
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,220
(Youngjoon: There's no way they put two mailboxes there for no reason.)

243
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,820
(Youngjoon: And the cards are not so thick that they can't be stuffed in one mailbox.)

244
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,180
(Minseon: I did think that more people would put it in the left mailbox.)

245
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:01,220
Do you know that?
(Minseon: I did think that more people would put it in the left mailbox.)

246
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,380
(Youngjoon: Do you know that?)
Do you know that?

247
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,670
(Youngjoon: When people stand at the fork, they tend to pick the left path.
Minseon: Really?)

248
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,700
-I really–
-It's about 70% to 80%.
(Youngjoon: When people stand at the fork, they tend to pick the left path.
Minseon: Really?)

249
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,660
(Youngjoon: It's about 70% to 80%.)
-I really–
-It's about 70% to 80%.

250
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,080
(Minseon: For me, it was really just because the left mailbox was closer.)

251
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,260
-For me, it was really just because the left mailbox was closer.
-Really?
(Minseon: For me, it was really just because the left mailbox was closer.)

252
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,140
-For me, it was really just because the left mailbox was closer.
-Really?

253
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,340
Oh.

254
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:17,750
(Those who put the letter into the left mailbox, Jaeseung, Hanmin, Minseon, Myeongkyun, and Youngjoon, prepare swim wear)
Oh.

255
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,070
(Those who put the letter into the left mailbox, Jaeseung, Hanmin, Minseon, Myeongkyun, and Youngjoon, prepare swim wear)

256
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,530
-They asked us to bring swim wear.
-We got a text.
(Those who put the letter into the left mailbox, Jaeseung, Hanmin, Minseon, Myeongkyun, and Youngjoon, prepare swim wear)

257
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,020
-They want us to bring swim wear?
-Yes.
(Those who put the letter into the left mailbox, Jaeseung, Hanmin, Minseon, Myeongkyun, and Youngjoon, prepare swim wear)

258
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,580
-They want us to bring swim wear?
-Yes.

259
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,000
(Myeongkyun: If it's not the swimming pool...
Youngjoon: By a stream?)
-They want us to bring swim wear?
-Yes.

260
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,060
(Myeongkyun: If it's not the swimming pool...
Youngjoon: By a stream?)

261
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,030
(Myeongkyun: Or... a yacht?)

262
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,170
I can't swim.
(Myeongkyun: Or... a yacht?)

263
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:30,220
I think it's related to water. I'm going to be a water sport.

264
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,180
(Minseon: I'm going to be a water sport.)
I think it's related to water. I'm going to be a water sport.

265
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,060
(Myeongkyun: Or a boat...)
(Swim wear?)

266
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,340
(Youngjoon: I like swimming pools.)

267
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,020
(Myeongkyun: I like yachts.)

268
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,940
(Youngjoon: Because you already went swimming.)

269
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,820
(Minseon: We had fun (in the pool) yesterday.
Myeongkyun: Yes.)

270
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,420
(Hanmin: What are you going to wear?
Youngjoon: What?

271
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:53,460
What bothers me...
(Hanmin: What are you going to wear?
Youngjoon: What?

272
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,740
(Hanmin: What bothers me is...)
What bothers me...

273
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,710
(Youngjoon and Hanmin plan to wear matching clothes)
Should I wear a different style?

274
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,460
The top is like this, but the pants are funny.
(Youngjoon and Hanmin plan to wear matching clothes)

275
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,760
(Youngjoon and Hanmin plan to wear matching clothes)

276
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,100
How about... Should I bring a vest?
(Youngjoon and Hanmin plan to wear matching clothes)

277
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,780
How about... Should I bring a vest?

(Hanmin: Should I bring a vest? And change my top into this?)
How about... Should I bring a vest?

279
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,670
-And change my top into this?
-Something like this?
(Hanmin: Should I bring a vest? And change my top into this?)

280
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,620
Something like this?
(Hanmin: Should I bring a vest? And change my top into this?)

281
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:10,660
(Hanmin: No fishnet. Just take out the vest by itself.)
Something like this?
(Hanmin: Should I bring a vest? And change my top into this?)

282
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,590
(Hanmin: No fishnet. Just take out the vest by itself.)

283
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,890
A black vest with black pants.
(Hanmin: No fishnet. Just take out the vest by itself.)

284
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,860
(Youngjoon: Sounds good. It sounds good.)

285
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,780
(Youngjoon: It's better than the clothes I chose.)

286
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:25,740
(Youngjoon: It's more sporty than mine.)

287
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,300
-Anyway, we have to wear clothes that can go into water.
-Yes.

288
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,260
(It's hard to choose clothes to go play in water)
-Anyway, we have to wear clothes that can go into water.
-Yes.

289
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,840
-We will bring another set, right?
-Yes.
(It's hard to choose clothes to go play in water)

290
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,120
Why don't you wear this and bring a swim wear?

291
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,100
(Black?)

292
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,660
(Okay)

293
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,490
(Minseon: Do you want to eat together?)

294
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:38,580
I tried one just now. It's really delicious.
(Minseon: Do you want to eat together?)

295
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,260
I tried one just now. It's really delicious.

(Hwi and Minseon who are ready to head out
come to eat)
I tried one just now. It's really delicious.

(Minseon: I think I ate too much.)

315
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,740
(Minseon: It can't be helped. Or don't make it so delicious.)

316

328
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,980
(Youngjoon: But it's pretty. It's not that exaggerated.

(Youngjoon: We'll wear another outfit when we're in the water anyway...)

336
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,240
Because of the pants.

337
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,340
(Hanmin: Oh, right. I need to wear a necklace.)

(So annoying)

449
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,220
(Jaeseung: They looked very happy.)

450
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:30,180
(Jaeseung: The clothes and accessories we wore together. They were discussing the same thing.)

451
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:36,380
(Jaeseung: The way they were discussing things made me envious.)

452

(Seungjin: Oh, really.)

485
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,140
(Seungjin: It's okay. No matter where we go, we can all fall into the water.)

486
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,500
(Hwi: I really hate getting into water.
Seungjin: Why?)

487
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,000
(Tempt)
(Hwi: I will just soak my feet.
Seungjin: Fall in.)

(Gosh) (Awkward)

491
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,860
(Just kidding)
((Goosebumps be gone))

492
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:05,380
So funny.

00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,300
(Hwi: Why is your hair like this?)

500
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,220
(Seungjin: Why are you saying that in my face?)

501
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,700
(Hwi: Did you do it on purpose?
Seungjin: Yes.)

502

(Seongmin: I just thought it was really funny.)

641
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:31,380
(Hwi: Seungjin's pitching pose is really cute.)

(Seongmin: But you don't know what the wish will be.)

653
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
(Seungjin: It doesn't matter what the wish is, we just have to follow it.)

-Okay. -Okay.

(Seongmin: I feel like it would get more complicated with the wishes.)

658
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,580
(Seongmin: Because it's tiring...)

659
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:09,180
(Seongmin: In my mind I thought, 'I hope Hwi wins.')

660

(The two become close)

744
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:29,380
(The two become close)

745
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,060
It hasn't changed much.
(The two become close)

746
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,060
It's okay, it's okay.
(The two become close)

747
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,250
(-So funny. -Seungjin: No, you can do it.)
It's okay, it's okay.
(The two become close)

748
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,260
(-So funny. -Seungjin: No, you can do it.)

749
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,900
(-Hwi: Ah, you can do it, you can do it. -Seungjin: Ah, of course, of course, of course.)

750
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,960
(With his last place confirmed, Seongmin tries one last time)

751
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,300
So...
(With his last place confirmed, Seongmin tries one last time)

752
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,200
So...

753
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:42,980
You have 46 points now.

754
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,420
(0 points for the last try)
You have 46 points now.

755
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,100
I don't want to play bowling anymore.
(0 points for the last try)

756
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,110
(Hwi 97 points, Seungjin 73 points, Seongmin 46 points)
-You have 46 points now. -I don't want to play bowling anymore.

757
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,600
He keeps getting 0 points.
(Hwi 97 points, Seungjin 73 points, Seongmin 46 points)

758
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,300
(Hwi 97 points, Seungjin 73 points, Seongmin 46 points)

759
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:55,500
(The chaotic bowling bet ends with laughter)

760
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:55,650
(Seungjin: Then does that mean Hwi has two wish coupons now?)

761
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:58,640
Then does that mean Hwi has two wish coupons now?
(Seungjin: Then does that mean Hwi has two wish coupons now?)

762
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,460
(Seungjin: Then does that mean Hwi has two wish coupons now?)

763
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,260
(Seungjin: When will you tell us your wish?)

764
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,300
(-Hwi: Before the last day? -Seungjin: Before the last day?)

765
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,740
(-Seongmin: Sure! -Hwi: Okay, Okay.)

766
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,220
(Hwi: I want to lie in the pool with Seungjin and just space out.)

767
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,700
(Hwi: I want to make this wish to him.)

768
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,740
(Hwi: To Seongmin...)

769
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,980
(Hwi: 'Let's get along as friends,')

770
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:26,060
(Hwi: is my current wish.)

771
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,980
(-Ah, I had fun game~ -It really was a fun game.)

772
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,220
(Hwi: Did you really have fun? With that score?)

773
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:30,320
(Seongmin: No but why is Hwi's score twice as much as mine?)

774
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,850
No but why is Hwi's score twice as much as mine?
(Seongmin: No but why is Hwi's score twice as much as mine?)

775
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,340
(Seongmin: No but why is Hwi's score twice as much as mine?)

776
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,660
(Hwi: Let's go, let's go, it was fun.)

777
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,640
(Let's go, let's go)

778
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,780
-We need to put the ball back. -Yeah we need to put it back.
(Let's go, let's go)

779
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,460
-We need to put the ball back. -Yeah we need to put it back.

780
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,700
(Seongmin: While bowling, I was really tired and missed Jaeseung.)

781
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,260
(Seongmin: So I wasn't really happy when I was playing.)

782
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,100
(Seongmin: But since all three of us sucked at it,)

783
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,780
(Seongmin: the situation was really funny.)

784
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,420
(Seongmin: So by the time we finished,)

785
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,340
(Seongmin: I felt less awkward with Hwi.)

786
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:58,020
(Seongmin: I'm glad that I got to laugh with Hwi the entire time.)

787
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,470
(A bowling date that focused on smiles and not scores)
Give it to me.

788
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,850
(A bowling date that focused on smiles and not scores)

789
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,100
It was fun.
(A bowling date that focused on smiles and not scores)

790
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,860
(A bowling date that focused on smiles and not scores)

791
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:15,500
(The three of them came to eat after their bowling date)

792
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,400
(Delicious foods prepared for the three)

793
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,000
-This looks so good! -This is crazy.
(Delicious foods prepared for the three)

794
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,320
(Delicious foods prepared for the three)

795
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,400
It might be better than yesterday's meat.
(Delicious foods prepared for the three)

796
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,390
Of course.
(Delicious foods prepared for the three)

797
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,760
This looks like beef tartare.
(Delicious foods prepared for the three)

798
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,500
Yeah, it looks kind of like beef tartare.
(Delicious foods prepared for the three)

799
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,060
Yeah, it looks kind of like beef tartare.

800
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,180
(Seongmin: I'm so happy, I'm seriously so happy what should I do?)

801
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,980
(Thank you for the meal.)

802
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,300
(How is it?)

803
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:34,420
Is it good?

804
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,330
(The best)
Is it good?

805
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:35,720

810
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,460
(Yes)

811
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,130
Is it good?

812
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,300
(Satisfied)

813
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,900
(Seungjin: It tastes good.)

814
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,900
(Seongmin: I'm so happy to be here.)

815
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,300
(Hwi: Wow, it's amazing.)

816
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,300
(Seungjin: But why is it the three of us again...)

817
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:57,470
(-Seungjin: Only the three of us put the letter in the right mailbox. -Seongmin: Yeah, I find it so interesting.)

(Seongmin: Why did only the three of us put it in the right mailbox?)

822
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,740
(Hwi: I somehow knew)

823
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,650
(Hwi: that more people were going to put it in the left mailbox.)

824
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,750
Really?
(Hwi: that more people were going to put it in the left mailbox.)

825
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,540
(Seongmin: I feel relaxed when I go out with you guys.)

826
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,260
(Seongmin: I feel at peace.)

827

(Seongmin: I'm not lying, I really feel at peace.)

828
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,980
(Hwi: I think it was fun today. It was healing.)

829
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,460
(Seongmin: I feel like I played with sleepy eyes.)

830
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:21,740
(Hwi: Your hands have no soul.)

831
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,500
-Your hands have no soul. -It's because I'm too relaxed.
(Hwi: Your hands have no soul.)

836
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,100
Why did you do that?
(Seongmin: It's because I'm too relaxed.)

837
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,260
(Seongmin: This is proof that you guys are precious and make me comfortable.)
Why did you do that?
(Seongmin: It's because I'm too relaxed.)

838
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:32,020
(Seongmin: This is proof that you guys are precious and make me comfortable.)

839
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,820
(Hwi: During these days here,)

840
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,980
(Hwi: do you guys have memorable moments?)

841
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,020
(Seungjin: For me, it was yesterday.)

842
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,230
(Seungjin went on a pottery date with Hwi the day before)

(Seongmin: Why yesterday?)
Why yesterday?

847
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,460
(Seongmin: Why yesterday?)

848
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:47,860
The reason is a secret.

849
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,350
(*Glances* Seungjin: The reason is a secret.)
The reason is a secret.

850
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,740
(*Glances* Seungjin: The reason is a secret.)

851
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:58,260
(Seungjin: My date at the pottery workshop with Hwi yesterday)

852
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,500
(Seungjin: was actually the most memorable to me.)

853
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,380
(Seungjin: But I was a bit shy to say it back then,)

854
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:07,860
(Seungjin: so I said it was a secret.)

855
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,220
(Seongmin: I...)

856
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:16,820
(-Seongmin: The most memorable moment? Can I only choose one? -Seungjin: Of course~)

857
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,330
(Seongmin: Why only one?)

858
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:18,500
Because the question is the most memorable one.
(Seongmin: Why only one?)

859
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,160
(Seungjin: Because the question is the most memorable one.)
Because the question is the most memorable one.

860
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,260
(Seungjin: Because the question is the most memorable one.)

861
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:23,660
The most memorable moment is...

862
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,230
(What is Seongmin's most memorable moment?)
The most memorable moment is...

863
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:28,650
If I don't think too much about it,
(What is Seongmin's most memorable moment?)

864
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,740
(Seongmin: I...)

865
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:42,140
(Hwi: I wanted him to say that his most memorable moment was his first date with me.)

866
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:49,020
(Seongmin: But if I'm being really honest, it's the exhibition.)

867
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,660
(Seongmin: Because it was a space that I really loved.)

868
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,300
(Seongmin: The space itself.)

869
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,140
(Hwi: You always said you wanted to go.)

870
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,380
(Seongmin: I've always wanted to go.)

871
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:02,100
(Seongmin: But to be honest, it was a bit of a pity that I went with Hanmin.)

872
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,500
(-Seungjin: Doesn't Hanmin not like places like that? -Hwi: Yeah, that's right.)

873
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,840
(Hwi: He kept wondering... why he has to go.)

874
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,580
Yeah.
(Hwi: He kept wondering... why he has to go.)

875
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:08,659
(Seongmin: This was a bit of a pity.)
Yeah.
(Hwi: He kept wondering... why he has to go.)

876
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:11,179
(Seongmin: This was a bit of a pity.)

877
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:13,980
(Seongmin: Hanmin wasn't the one I wanted to go to the exhibition with.)

878
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,980
(Seungjin: Then who did you want to go with?)

879
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,659
(Seungjin: I got it. Next~)

880
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:29,699
(Seungjin: I have a question for Seongmin.)

881
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:32,460
(Seongmin: What is it? I don't know what it is but do you have to ask?)

882
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,100
(Seongmin: Do you have to ask right now?)

883
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,699
(Seongmin: Okay then go ahead...)

884
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,380
(Seungjin: I'm really just curious but)

885
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:47,460
(Seungjin: how do you feel about Jaeseung right now...)

886
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,699
(Seungjin: I've actually been wanting to ask since yesterday.)

887
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:56,219
(Hwi: Because Seungjin likes Jaeseung)

888
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:00,540
(Hwi: so I think that's why he wanted to know about Seongmin and Jaeseung's relationship.)

889
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:06,060
(-Seongmin: How I feel towards Jaeseung? -Seungjin: Yeah.)

890
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:12,110
(Seongmin: I'm interested in Jaeseung.)

891
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:12,180
Do you like him the most at Men's House?
(Seongmin: I'm interested in Jaeseung.)

(Seungjin: Do you like him the most at Men's House?)

894
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,500
(Seongmin: Yeah Jaeseung)

895
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,980
(Seongmin: is who I'm most interested in right now at Men's House.)

896
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:26,100
(Seungjin: I think Seongmin is really determined.)

897
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,900
(Seungjin: So far I think)

898
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,780
(Seungjin: Seongmin is the most sincere right now.)

899
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:38,460
(Seungjin: Because other than the letters we sent yesterday,)

900
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,220
(Seungjin: we've also asked each other anonymously before.)

901
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,540
(Seungjin: Back then I asked Jaeseung,)

902
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,340
(Seungjin: 'if his feelings towards Seongmin were sincere.')

903
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:48,820
That's right.
(Seungjin: 'if his feelings towards Seongmin were sincere.')

904
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,110
(Seongmin: You're the one who wrote that? You really are a villain.)
That's right.
(Seungjin: 'if his feelings towards Seongmin were sincere.')

905
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,260
(Seongmin: You're the one who wrote that? You really are a villain.)

906
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,530
(Hwi: I was really surprised.)

907
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:53,980
I really...
(Hwi: I was really surprised.)

908
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,280
(Seongmin: I was even next to Jaeseung so I saw it.)
I really...
(Hwi: I was really surprised.)

909
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,900
I was even next to Jaeseung
(Seongmin: I was even next to Jaeseung so I saw it.)

910
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:55,920
(It wasn't me TT) (-Hwi: After reading that, everyone was looking at me. -Seongmin: I thought it was Hwi's anonymous question.)
I was even next to Jaeseung
(Seongmin: I was even next to Jaeseung so I saw it.)

911
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,470
so I saw it.
(It wasn't me TT) (-Hwi: After reading that, everyone was looking at me. -Seongmin: I thought it was Hwi's anonymous question.)

912
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,300
After reading that,
(It wasn't me TT) (-Hwi: After reading that, everyone was looking at me. -Seongmin: I thought it was Hwi's anonymous question.)

913
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:58,910
everyone was looking at me.
(It wasn't me TT) (-Hwi: After reading that, everyone was looking at me. -Seongmin: I thought it was Hwi's anonymous question.)

914
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,380
I thought it was Hwi.
(It wasn't me TT) (-Hwi: After reading that, everyone was looking at me. -Seongmin: I thought it was Hwi's anonymous question.)

915
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,230
It wasn't me.
(It wasn't me TT) (-Hwi: After reading that, everyone was looking at me. -Seongmin: I thought it was Hwi's anonymous question.)

916
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,900
(Seungjin: I was a bit hurt back then, do you guys know why?)

917
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,380
(Seungjin: Because Seongmin was the one that got it.)

918
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,100
(Seongmin: Right~ I picked that one.)

919
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,140
(Hwi: Yeah, I felt so wronged.)

920
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:16,020
(-Hwi: Youngjoon was staring at me. -Seungjin: Oh, that's what happened?)

921
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:20,220
(-Seongmin: Then Jaeseung must have misunderstood, too. -Seungjin: Yeah.)

922
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,560
(Seungjin: Tell him today, that Seungjin was the one who wrote it.)

923
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,690
Really...
(Seungjin: Tell him today, that Seungjin was the one who wrote it.)

924
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:24,500
(Seungjin: Tell him today, that Seungjin was the one who wrote it.)

925
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,780
(Seongmin: It was such a turn of events.)

926
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:26,870
(Seongmin: I thought Hwi wrote that anonymous question.)

927
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:29,400
I thought Hwi wrote that anonymous question.
(Seongmin: I thought Hwi wrote that anonymous question.)

928
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,220
(Seongmin: So I think Jaeseung was also unhappy about it.)

929
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:40,020
(Hwi: Then is there something you regret doing at Men's House?)

930
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,070
(-Seungjin: That happened yesterday, too. -Hwi: What happened yesterday?)

931
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,590
That happened yesterday, too.
(-Seungjin: That happened yesterday, too. -Hwi: What happened yesterday?)

932
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,340
-What happened yesterday? -Why? What happened yesterday?
(-Seungjin: That happened yesterday, too. -Hwi: What happened yesterday?)

933
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:43,500
(Seungjin: The happiest moment is a secret)
-What happened yesterday? -Why? What happened yesterday?
(-Seungjin: That happened yesterday, too. -Hwi: What happened yesterday?)

934
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,300
(Seungjin: The happiest moment is a secret)

935
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,940
(Seungjin: but the moment I regret most was the letter I wrote yesterday.)

936
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,980
(Seongmin: Why?)

937
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,780
(Seungjin: The thoughts I had while writing yesterday)

938
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,180
(Seungjin: are really different from right now)

939
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,290
(Seungjin: so I really want to burn the letter.)

940
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,380
I want to destroy it.
(Seungjin: so I really want to burn the letter.)

941
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:04,440
(Seungjin: I wish my letter didn't exist. I want it to disappear.)
I want to destroy it.
(Seungjin: so I really want to burn the letter.)

942
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,920
-Do you want to rewrite it? -I wish my letter didn't exist.
(Seungjin: I wish my letter didn't exist. I want it to disappear.)

943
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,790
I want it to disappear.
(Seungjin: I wish my letter didn't exist. I want it to disappear.)

944
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,220
(Seungjin: I wish my letter didn't exist. I want it to disappear.)

945
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,380
(Seongmin: What about Hwi?)

946
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,140
(Hwi: The moment I regret most?)

947
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:15,260
There is no such moment.
(Hwi: The moment I regret most?)

948
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,090
(Hwi: There is no such moment.)
There is no such moment.

949
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:17,860
(Hwi: There is no such moment.)

950
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:22,900
(Hwi: I just think my vision is too narrow.)

951
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,620
(Hwi: Up till now, whether it's love or flirting,)

952
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:31,060
(Hwi: the other party has always liked me first.)

953
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:37,020
(Hwi: This is the first time I like someone more than they like me)

954
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,900
(Hwi: so I feel like my vision has become narrow.)

955
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,620
(Hwi: I can't see anything else...)

956
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:47,780
(Hwi: So I regret my actions.)

957
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,220
It's understandable.

958
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,500
(Hwi: But because of that, I could understand myself better.)

959
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,970
Yeah.

960
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,940
(Seungjin: I'm a little... I can't seem to grasp it.)

961
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:02,020
(Seungjin: Because up till yesterday, it wasn't like this.)

962
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:07,500
(Seungjin: There was always a mix of jokes in between.)

963
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,180
I think I found the feeling again.

964
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,580
(Hwi is closer to Seungjin than usual.)
I think I found the feeling again.

965
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,580
(Hwi is closer to Seungjin than usual.)

966
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,950
Good luck to you.
(Hwi is closer to Seungjin than usual.)

967
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,580
(Hwi is closer to Seungjin than usual.)

968
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:13,940
46 points.

969
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,130
(Hwi's movements seem different from usual)
46 points.

970
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,990
You only have 46 points, how can you pitch like that?
(Hwi's movements seem different from usual)

971
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:23,060
(Seungjin: It could just be my own feelings.)

972
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:27,180
(Seungjin: 'It could just be my own feelings.')

973
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,100
(Seungjin. Since he said he's over Seongmin now,)

974
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,340
(Seungjin: 'who knows? He might have feelings for someone else.')

975
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,920
I think that person might be me.

976
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:40,260
Time flies.

977
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,570
(There's only one day left at Men's House)
Time flies.

978
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,180
(There's only one day left at Men's House)

979
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:49,980
(Seungjin: I feel like the past five days felt like one day.)

980
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,230
(Seungjin: It feels like the five days have been compacted into one.)

981
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,660
My memories are a bit fuzzy
(Seungjin: It feels like the five days have been compacted into one.)

982
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,210
(Seungjin: like I don't really know what happened.)
My memories are a bit fuzzy

983
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,670
(Seungjin: like I don't really know what happened.)

984
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,300
But then once you pay attention...
(Seungjin: like I don't really know what happened.)

985
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:57,530
(Seungjin: Once I pay attention it's already like this.)
But then once you pay attention...
(Seungjin: like I don't really know what happened.)

986
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,100
(Seungjin: Once I pay attention it's already like this.)

987
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,760
(Seungjin: But every day was tiring.)

988
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,060
That's right.
(Seungjin: But every day was tiring.)

989
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:02,620
That's right.

990
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:02,640
(Agreed)
That's right.

991
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,830
That's right.
(Agreed)

992
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:04,790
Even so,
(Agreed)

993
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,580
it went by so fast.
(Agreed)

994
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:05,740
it went by so fast.

995
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,620
(Time flies at Men's House)
it went by so fast.

996
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,660
Although every day is hard,
(Time flies at Men's House)

997
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,380
(Seongmin: it was really fun.)

998
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,480
Really.
(Seongmin: it was really fun.)

999
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,180
(Seungjin: But during those five days,)

1000
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:19,040
(Seungjin: I learned a lot about myself.)

1001
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,290
After I came here,
(Seungjin: I learned a lot about myself.)

1002
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,140
(Seungjin: I was surprised.)

1003
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:27,010
(Seongmin: I'm a bit scared of going back to reality after this.)

1004
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:27,930
Yeah.
(Seongmin: I'm a bit scared of going back to reality after this.)

1005
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,660
(Seongmin: I'm a bit scared of going back to reality after this.)

1006
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,780
(Seongmin: But my goal is to spend the rest of the days without regret.)

1007
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,180
(Seongmin: 'I want to spend the days sincerely.')

1008
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,860
(Seongmin: This is how I feel.)

1009
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:44,130
(Hwi: It's hard, but I got attached.)

1010
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,200
Me too.
(Hwi: It's hard, but I got attached.)

1011
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,950
(Hwi: So I feel sad.)

1012
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:47,100
Yeah.
(Hwi: So I feel sad.)

1013
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,630
(Hwi: The house and the people...)
Yeah.

1014
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,860
(Hwi: The house and the people...)

1015
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,820
Where else can I experience this?

1016
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:51,900
(-Hwi: I feel like I will remember this experience forever. -Me too. That's what I think, too.)
Where else can I experience this?

1017
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,220
(-Hwi: I feel like I will remember this experience forever. -Me too. That's what I think, too.)

1018
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,220
I think so too.
(-Hwi: I feel like I will remember this experience forever. -Me too. That's what I think, too.)

1019
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:57,330
(Seongmin: I'll never forget this)
I think so too.
(-Hwi: I feel like I will remember this experience forever. -Me too. That's what I think, too.)

1020

(Seongmin: I'll never forget this)

1021
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,510
-Never. -Really.
(Seongmin: I'll never forget this)

1022
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,900
Never.
(Seongmin: I'll never forget this)

1023
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,420
Never.
(Seongmin: I'll never forget this)

1024
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:01,940
Never.

1025
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,820
(Seongmin: Honestly, I think I get along well in terms of communication)

1026
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,820
(Seongmin: with (Seungjin & Hwi))

1027
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,740
(Seongmin: I'm happy to have gotten closer with them)

1028
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,940
(Seungjin: I'm happy that the three of us)

1029
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,780
(Seungjin: enjoyed a relaxing time together)

1030
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:26,820
(Seungjin: We had conversations that were honest and genuine)

1031
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:32,060
(Seungjin: I went on dates with Hwi for two days in a row)

1032
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:38,220
(Seungjin: I think he's really a good person)

1033
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,900
(Hwi: Seongmin, Seungjin, and I)

1034
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,900
(Hwi: get along very well. I had a good time)

1035
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:44,170
(After a meal with genuine conversations)

1036
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,230
-Let's go if we're done. -Okay.
(After a meal with genuine conversations)

1037
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,330
If we're done...
(After a meal with genuine conversations)

1038
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:46,860
(After a meal with genuine conversations)

1039
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,260
(Hwi: I had a really great meal)

1040
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:48,360
(Seungjin: Let's shake hands)

1041

(Hanmin: Because it bounced, he suddenly came towards me)

1206
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,340
(Hanmin: The position was a bit...)

1207
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,730
(Help!)

1208

It's like riding a yacht on the sea.
(Minseon: This is awesome)

1211
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,390
So funny.

1223
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,260
What are you two doing?
(Embracing) (Youngjoon's practically in Hanmin's arms)

1224
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:10,180
(Youngjoon: I tried leaning towards Hanmin)

1225
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:15,820
(Youngjoon: I tried to have natural physical contact)

1226

(Someone has to get off. It's not flying)

1263
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,960
(Youngjoon: It's too heavy to fly)

1264
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,480
It's supposed to fly.

1265
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,330
(Youngjoon: The heavy one, please get off)
(Minseon: The heavy one? Me?

1359
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:31,960
(Super satisfied menu choice)

1360
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,250
It's really good.
(Super satisfied menu choice)

1361
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,500
(Youngjoon: We finished it all up)

1362
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,460
(Youngjoon: I didn't quite care about talking)

1363
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:45,260
(Youngjoon: I wanted to finish it quickly and go on the next ride)

1364
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,620
(Minseon: Myeongkyun had food all over his lips)

1365
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:52,300
(Minseon: I was wondering how to help him)

1366
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:52,860
So I wiped it off for him.
(Minseon: I was wondering how to help him)

1367
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,510
So I wiped it off for him.

1368
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,460
(Youngjoon: do you like active stuff?)

1369
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,740
(Minseon: Yes, I love it)

1370
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:05,100
(Youngjoon: All the active ones are here)
(Hanmin: That's right)

1371
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:11,540
(Jaeseung: Do Hwi and Seungjin like non-active stuff too?)
(Minseon: Yeah)

1372
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:15,300
(Youngjoon: Hwi also likes to look at art exhibits)

1373
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,580
(Myeongkyun: How did this happen?)

1374
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,800
(Minseon: I think all the active ones are here)

1375
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,340
How did this happen?
(Minseon: I think all the active ones are here)

1376
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:19,640
(Myeongkyun: It's amazing)
How did this happen?
(Minseon: I think all the active ones are here)

1377
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,260
(Myeongkyun: It's amazing)

1378
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,300
(Youngjoon: But they might not be doing non-active stuff)

1379
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,220
(Youngjoon: We could all be doing active stuff today)

1380
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:31,380
(Myeongkyun: They could be on a hot air balloon or something)
(Minseon: Well? That's possible)

1381
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,260
(Youngjoon: But it's raining)
(Minseon: Yeah)

1382
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,300
(Myeongkyun: Does it matter for hot air balloons?)

1383
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,460
(Minseon: Let's ask them later)

1384
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:45,300
(Minseon: It's so nice eating while listening to the rain)

1385
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:48,740
(Jaeseung: I can't go on any more rides with the rain)

1386
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:51,580
(Jaeseung: I felt cold when I got drenched by the rain)

1387
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,700
It suddenly started pouring.

1388
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:55,050
(The pizza's all gone)

1389
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:57,880
Let's clean up. Are you done?
(The pizza's all gone)

1390
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,780
(Youngjoon: Let's clean up and go play now)

1391
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:06,420
(There's no sign of the rain stopping)

1392
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:15,860
(Jaeseung decides to go home first)

1393
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,180
(Jaeseung: Are you having fun?)

1394
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,660
(Jaeseung: I was having a lot of fun too)

1395
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,940
(Jaeseung: But I really don't feel well)

1396
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:28,500
(Jaeseung: I felt body chills after playing in the water)

1397
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,940
(Jaeseung: I feel like I have a slight fever too)

1398
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:35,060
(Youngjoon: Go home and get some rest. Get some sleep)

1399
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,820
(Minseon: We'll be go back soon too)
(Youngjoon: Take some medicine and get some sleep)

1400
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:41,180
(Jaeseung: I envy you)

1401
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:44,740
(Minseon: If we stop him, he might feel more uncomfortable)

1402
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,940
(Minseon: I really wanted to play with everyone)

1403
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:50,420
(Minseon: I think it'll be more fun if we play together)

1404
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:56,780
(Sad Jaeseung leaves first)

1405
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:16,100
(Jaeseung goes back to the empty Men's House alone)

1406
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:19,020
(Ah, it's cold)

1407
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:26,780
(Jaeseung: Gosh. I'm so cold)

1408
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:34,540
(A quiet and empty house)

1409
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:42,900
(He feels more sick since he's alone)

1410
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:54,300
(Cold medicine)

1411
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:10,620
(Jaeseung lies in bed after taking medicine)

1412
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:32,420
(I miss Seongmin)

1413
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:35,580
(Hwi: Jaeseung, you were always cold to me)

1414
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:39,780
(Jaeseung: No...)
(Hwi: Seriously...)

1415
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:50,140
(Also, when you look at me, can you smile at me?)

1416
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,930
So annoying.

1417
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:52,560
(Caressing)

1418
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,880
Why?
(Caressing)

1419
00:57:54,020 --> 00:58:00,020
(Hwi: When you look at me, you never smile at me)

1420
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:06,220
(Jaeseung: When I think of Hwi, I have complex feelings)

1421
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:10,900
(Seongmin: I can't watch them anymore)

1422
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:15,220
(How will this love triangle turn out?)

1423
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:15,380
What is this?

1424
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:18,340
(Letters on the beds)
What is this?

1425
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:22,860
(And... Hanmin receives two letters)

1426
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,860
(Hanmin: I'm a little flustered)

1427
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:27,660
(Youngjoon: Who would write to Hanmin at this point?)

1428
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:30,060
(Youngjoon: I'm a bit bothered...)

1429
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:33,340
(Youngjoon: At least 1% more uncomfortable...)

1430
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:38,140
(A new romance starting with a letter?)
