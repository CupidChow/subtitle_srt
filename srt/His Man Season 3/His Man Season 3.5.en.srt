00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,180
(Youngjoon: Why did I get a heart?)
Darn it.

169
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,580
(Youngjoon: Why did I get a heart?)

170
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:05,540
(An "arrow" can invite a "heart" on a date.
Only three couples can go on dates)

171
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,780
(Youngjoon: Did you see downstairs?)
(Hanmin: Hmm?)

172
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,400
(Youngjoon: Downstairs...)

173
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,660
-Downstairs... -Huh?
(Youngjoon: Downstairs...)

174
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
(Youngjoon: Did you see the mission downstairs?)
(Hanmin: No)

175
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,820
(Youngjoon: Go pick one)

176
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,160
(Youngjoon: Choose wisely)

177
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,240
Okay.
(Youngjoon: Choose wisely)

178
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,500
(Make sure you pick the right one. Please)

179
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,300
(Youngjoon: What if Hanmin chooses a heart too?)

180
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,900
(Youngjoon: Or if I can't go on a date with him,)

181
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,340
(Youngjoon: is it better if he stays home?)

182
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,940
(Hanmin: If the same card appears,)

183
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,380
(Hanmin: we won't be able to date today)

184
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,940
(Hanmin: (Youngjoon) and I agreed to go on a date)

185
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,420
(Hanmin carefully chooses a card)

186
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,500
(Nervous)

187
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,420
(Youngjoon: Did you choose one?)
(Hanmin: Yes)

188
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,700
(Hanmin: Let me see)
(Youngjoon: Mine?)

189
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,060
(Hanmin: Arrow) (Youngjoon: Heart)

190
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,460
(He smiles now that he's assured)

191
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,580
(Hanmin: If there is nothing special...)
(Youngjoon: What did you say?)

192
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,140
(Hanmin: If there's nothing special...)

193
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,240
(Let’s go have fun)

194
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,500
Then both of us can go after we're prepared.
(Let’s go have fun)

195
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,660
Then both of us can go after we're prepared.

196
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,120
(Hanmin's date invitation filled with shyness)
Then both of us can go after we're prepared.

197
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,500
(Hanmin's date invitation filled with shyness)

198
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,860
(Youngjoon: What a relief)

199
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,860
(Youngjoon: I wanted to get an arrow, but it turned out to be a heart)

200
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,660
(Youngjoon: That means there's nothing I can do about it)

201
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,540
(Youngjoon: But after thinking about it, even if I get an arrow,)

202
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,840
(Youngjoon: if you get an arrow, it wouldn't work too)

203
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,580
Right.
(Youngjoon: if you get an arrow, it wouldn't work too)

204
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:43,660
(Hanmin: I feel both)
Right.
(Youngjoon: if you get an arrow, it wouldn't work too)

205
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,060
(Hanmin: I feel both)

206
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:51,460
(Hanmin: relieved and really glad)

207
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,540
(Hanmin: to go on a proper date)

208
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,420
(Youngjoon: I'm so, so happy)

209
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,420
(Youngjoon: Everything's resolved now)

210
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,020
(Youngjoon: The game is over)

211
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:01,820
-Is that Minseon inside? -Yes.

212
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,140
(He suddenly feels happier)
-Is that Minseon inside? -Yes.

213
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,860
(He suddenly feels happier)

214
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,300
(Youngjoon: Minseon!)

215
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,660
(Youngjoon: There's no time)

216
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,140
(Okay, I'm almost done)

217
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:15,900
(Youngjoon: I'd advise you to go down right away instead of drying off)
(Minseon: Gosh, please, I really hate events like this)

218
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,380
Gosh.

219
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:17,680
(Rushes out without drying off)
Gosh.

220
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,340
(Rushes out without drying off)

221
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,940
(Let's go and watch)

222
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,140
(Seungjin going down to the living room too)

223
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,980
(Youngjoon: The early bird goes on a date)

224
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,850
(Seongmin: What is it?

225
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,220
I haven't dried my hair.
(Seongmin: What is it?

226
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,580
(Oh, I got a heart!)

227
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,360
(Seongmin: Do I have to pick later?)
(Youngjoon: There'll be nothing to pick from then)

228
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,370
Okay.
(Seongmin: Do I have to pick later?)
(Youngjoon: There'll be nothing to pick from then)

229
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,780
(Seongmin: Do I have to pick later?)
(Youngjoon: There'll be nothing to pick from then)

230
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:54,140
(Minseon, Seongmin, and Seungjin each pick a card)

231
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:56,720
(Seongmin finally reads the mission card now)

232
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,890
What does it say?
(Seongmin finally reads the mission card now)

233
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:58,780
(Seongmin finally reads the mission card now)

234
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,870
Who got hearts and who got arrows?

235
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,580
(Seongmin: I got a heart. What's yours?)

236
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,220
(Arrow card)

237
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,100
Yeah. It depends on who... Just take it.

238
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,900
(Seungjin: Rather than choosing someone,)

239
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,260
(Seungjin: I'd rather be chosen)

240
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,700
(Seungjin: Because I want to be more passive)

241
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,020
(Seungjin: So I wanted to get a heart card, but after picking it,)

242
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,140
(Seungjin: I got an arrow card)

243
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,980
(What would the "arrow" Seungjin do?)

244
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:44,180
(There's only one card left)

245
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:50,940
(Who will get the last card?)

246
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:56,580
(Youngjoon: Is this the time to focus on cooking?)
(Jaeseung: Did you just ask if I should focus on cooking now?)

247
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,660
(Youngjoon: Hurry up!)

248
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:57,860
-You'll regret it. -I'm screwed.

249
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,180
(Jaeseung's busy making breakfast)
-You'll regret it. -I'm screwed.

250
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,740
(Youngjoon: There's one left)
(Jaeseung: One minute left for this too)

251
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,570
(Myeongkyun comes down to the living room)

252
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,570
Where's the card?
(Myeongkyun comes down to the living room)

253
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,140
(Myeongkyun: Is there only one left?)

254
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:18,540
(Youngjoon: Go get it! It's the last one)
(Jaeseung: Anyway, there are... How many are there? Aren't there six?)

255
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,380
(Youngjoon: There are eight of us)

256
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:20,770
(Oh?)

257
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,980
There are eight of us, you fool.
(Oh?)

258
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,500
There are eight of us, you fool.

259
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,340
(Hurry up and take it)
(Myeongkyun: Do I just... just take this?)

260
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,340
(Rushing) (Youngjoon: It's not the time to take off your apron. Go now!)

261
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:35,740
Am I the last one?

262
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,650
(Myeongkyun gets the last card)
Am I the last one?

263
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,470
(Myeongkyun gets the last card)

264
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,600
Have you picked one?
(Myeongkyun gets the last card)

265
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,300
(Myeongkyun gets the last card)

266
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,300
(Jaeseung misses it by a hair)

267
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,430
Have you picked one?
(Jaeseung misses it by a hair)

268
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,300
(Jaeseung misses it by a hair)

269
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,950
(Flustered) (Embarrassed)

270
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,680
What? Did I choose the last one?
(Flustered) (Embarrassed)

271
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,540
(Flustered) (Embarrassed)

272
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,700
(Myeongkyun: First, I was worried about Jaeseung)

273
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,220
(Myeongkyun: I feel like I stole the last chance)

274
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,660
(Myeongkyun: I felt sorry to him)

275
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,700
(The last card Myeongkyun got is an arrow)

276
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,100
(Jaeseung: None(?) is going well for me today)

277
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,220
(Jaeseung: None(?) is going well for me today)

278
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,020
None... None...

279
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,020
(Youngjoon: Why are you so relaxed?)
None... None...

280
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,780
(Youngjoon: It was right in front of you. You could've just grabbed it)

281
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:14,180
(Jaeseung: It's a mission where the remaining two have no right to choose)

282
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,300
(Jaeseung: That's why I got more frustrated)

283
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,220
Did you pick one?

284
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,140
(Jaeseung: I'm not in my right mind)
Did you pick one?

285
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,700
What did you pick?
(Jaeseung: I'm not in my right mind)

286
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,030
(Jaeseung: I didn't get anything)
What did you pick?
(Jaeseung: I'm not in my right mind)

287
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,100
(Jaeseung: I didn't get anything)

288
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,140
(Seongmin: You didn't?)

289
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,500
(Seongmin: Jaeseung's in a bad mood)

290
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,780
(Seongmin: I can tell from his expression and tone right away)

291
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,700
(Jaeseung: What did you pick?)

292
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:36,820
(Seongmin: heart card)

293
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,070
It says, "Take whatever you want."
(Seongmin: heart card)

294
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,460
I wanted to go on a date with you.

295
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,780
(Jaeseung & Seongmin realize they can't date today)
I wanted to go on a date with you.

296
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,820
What a pity.
(Jaeseung & Seongmin realize they can't date today)

297
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
-But... -How many cards were there?
(Jaeseung & Seongmin realize they can't date today)

298
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,460
(Jaeseung & Seongmin realize they can't date today)

299
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:53,500
(Jaeseung: If I can't do what I want to do,)

300
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,460
(Jaeseung: I'll be uneasy. I realized it for the first time now)

301
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,660
(Myeongkyun: I didn't want to use my secret trick)

302
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,940
(Jaeseung: What secret trick?)

303
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,850
(Sigh...)

304
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,180
Sorry.
(Sigh...)

305
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,940
(Myeongkyun: I'll put this back... Okay)
(Jaeseung: Wait. Right now, I...)
Sorry.

306
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,980
(Myeongkyun: I'll put this back... Okay)
(Jaeseung: Wait. Right now, I...)

307
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,580
(Jaeseung: Now... I really hate myself now)

308
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:28,900
(Jaeseung: I really hate myself now)

309
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,560
(Jaeseung: I'm losing self esteem)

310
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,660
Say "I love myself" to yourself.
(Jaeseung: I'm losing self esteem)

311
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,340
(Jaeseung: I'm losing self esteem)

312
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,300
(Jaeseung: It's not Myeongkyun's fault that the tongs dropped)

313
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:41,500
(Jaeseung: I was just frustrated that nothing was going my way)

314
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,180
(Jaeseung: I was too sensitive)

315
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,650
(Hwi: What (card) did you pick? Is it a secret?)

316
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,740
What did you pick?
(Hwi: What (card) did you pick? Is it a secret?)

317
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,860
(Hwi: Is it a secret?)

318
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,870
(Seongmin: Aren't you an arrow?)

319
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,380
I saw it.
(Seongmin: Aren't you an arrow?)

320
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:51,470
(Hey!)
I saw it.
(Seongmin: Aren't you an arrow?)

321
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,820
(Hey!)

322
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,580
(Seongmin: Hwi doesn't have a card anyway. I have a heart card)

323
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,620
(Seongmin: Hwi didn't pick a card)

324
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,620
(Hwi: It was first come first served, right?)

325
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,690

00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,810
-Okay. -This ring is Size 15 mm, right?
(The rings are ready)

646
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,070
-Yes. -Yes.
(The rings are ready)

647
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,200
-Try it on to see if it fits. -We took each other's, right?

648
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,140
(Youngjoon: Should I put it on for you?)

649
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,900
(Hanmin: Okay)

650
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,140
(Youngjoon: Put it on for me)

651
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,180
I just...

652
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,020
(Finally put the rings on each other)
I just...

653
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,320
(Finally put the rings on each other)

654
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,500
Push it in.
(Finally put the rings on each other)

655
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,690
(Finally put the rings on each other)

656
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:57,700
Just right.
(Finally put the rings on each other)

657
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,870
(Finally put the rings on each other)

658
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,010
Here too.
(Finally put the rings on each other)

659
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:03,540
(Finally put the rings on each other)

660
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,800
(Rings fit perfectly on them)

661
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,110
-Nice. -Nice.
(Rings fit perfectly on them)

662
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,900
(Rings fit perfectly on them)

663
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,420
(Youngjoon: When we got the finished rings,)

664
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,700
(Youngjoon: I wanted to put it on quickly)

665
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:23,140
(Youngjoon: I thought I'd take the chance to put it on for him)

666
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,380
(Hanmin: We put the rings on each other's fingers)

667
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,900
(Hanmin: I felt a little...)

668
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,660
(Hanmin: How should I put it? Butterflies in my tummy?)

669
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,220
(Hanmin: I think so)

670
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:40,980
(One-of-a-kind rings and memories)

671
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:45,340
(Location of Youngjoon & Hanmin's second date)

672
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:50,260
(A cafe that looks like an art gallery)

673
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,620
(Youngjoon: It's a photo spot. There are artworks too)

674
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,620
It's all written.
(Youngjoon: It's a photo spot. There are artworks too)

675
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,410
It's all written.

676
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,780
(Hello)

677
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,030
(Hanmin: Thank you)

678
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:00,100
-Thank you. -Thank you.
(Hanmin: Thank you)

679
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,660
-Thank you. -Thank you.

680
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,260
-Mix the drinks well. -Okay.

681
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,780
(Youngjoon: Look at the color)

682
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,220
(Youngjoon: It's an interesting color)

683
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:08,740
Yes, you can use this.
(Youngjoon: It's an interesting color)

684
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:08,780
Yes, you can use this.

685
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,640
(Sweet)
Yes, you can use this.

686
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,980
(Sweet)

687
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:19,260
(Youngjoon: Yummy)
(Hanmin: Yeah?)

688
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:25,460
(Hanmin: (On the second day,) what were you thinking when I first appeared? When I first went there)

689
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:30,020
(Youngjoon: What came to my mind first was... Adding a member at this time?)

690
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,140
(Youngjoon: That was my first thought)

691
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:38,420
(Youngjoon: Later, I turned around and looked around)

692
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,940
(Youngjoon: When I turned around, it was so bright outside)

693
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,300
(Youngjoon: You were wearing denim all over so you looked dark)

694
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,100
(Youngjoon: I saw a shadow approaching us)

695
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,860
(Hanmin: Like a Grim Reaper?)
(Youngjoon: No)

696
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:57,700
(Youngjoon: Your silhouette was slim and you gave off a clean-cut vibe)

697
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,820
(Youngjoon: Looks-wise, my ideal type is)

698
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,180
(Youngjoon: someone slim with long eyes)

699
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:11,900
(Youngjoon: That's how you looked. So I had a good first impression of you)

700
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:16,460
(Youngjoon: That's why I quickly cleared up the seat next to me)

701
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,260
(Youngjoon: I was thinking really quickly)

702
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,340
(Hanmin: In that split second, he said he guided me to sit next to him)

703
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:28,020
(Hanmin: To be honest, it made me really happy)

704
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:33,660
(Youngjoon: In short, from the first impression, I was already...)

705
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,820
(Interested in you)

706
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,940
I see.

707
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:50,820
(Youngjoon: Yesterday... I'll tell you about this in detail in the evening)

708
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:57,820
(Youngjoon: After dinner and doing the dishes,)

709
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,620
(Youngjoon: Myeongkyun and I were chatting)

710
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,500
(Youngjoon: Then you came in)

711
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,260
(Youngjoon: So (Myeongkyun) and I stopped chatting)

712
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:09,540
(Youngjoon: Then when I went to my room, Myeongkyun came and we talked for a while)

713
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,489
(Youngjoon: Then you popped up again)

714
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:13,219
So...
(Youngjoon: Then you popped up again)

715
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,580
(Youngjoon: Is there a reason (why you came)?)

716
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:23,060
(Hanmin: Well, I just stayed naturally to chat)

717
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,940
(Hanmin: One by one, people (left) naturally)

718
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:33,699
(Hanmin: First of all, we met for the first time at the cafe as a threesome)

719
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:37,540
(Hanmin: There's still a lot we haven't talked about)

720
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:42,980
(Hanmin: I wanted to talk more with you)

721
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,060
(Hanmin: So I was trying to find the time to talk)

722
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,620
(Hanmin: So I followed you around)
(Youngjoon: Followed me?)

723
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:54,980
(Youngjoon: It felt very Hanmin-like to approach someone)

724
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:59,460
(Youngjoon: and express his feelings sincerely. It was cute)

725
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,660
(Youngjoon: I suddenly thought of something)
(Hanmin: What is it?)

726
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,940
(Youngjoon: (During yesterday's) call session, you received a call)
(Hanmin: Yes)

727
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,540
(Youngjoon: You received a call from someone else first)

728
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:16,740
(Youngjoon: I forgot about that)
(Hanmin: Me too)

729
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:22,180
(Youngjoon: You said you knew who it was, right?)
(Hanmin: Yes, I'm quite sure)

730
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,940
(Hanmin: In my opinion...)

731
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,500
(Hanmin: it should be Myeongkyun)

732
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:37,700
(Hanmin: Because (Myeongkyun) was a newbie just like me)
(Youngjoon: Because you arrived together?)

733
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:41,970
While I was answering him, even though I wasn't cheating...

734
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:47,740
(Hanmin: I stuttered as I answered him)

735
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,540
(Youngjoon: Oh? Myeongkyun again?)

736
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:53,500
(Youngjoon: When I hear the name Myeongkyun now,)

737
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:58,180
(Youngjoon: it bothers me)

738
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,860
(Hanmin: And I don't know if you heard our call)

739
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,340
(Hanmin: We barely said anything and the call was disconnected)

740
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:11,700
(Hanmin: I remember the call was disconnected when he was about to say something)

741
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,300
(Youngjoon: I think he fell asleep while on the call)

742
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,500
(Hanmin: He seemed very tired yesterday)

743
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,060
(Youngjoon: I got quite a lot of stress from Myeongkyun)

744
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,860
(Youngjoon: yesterday)

745
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:27,180
(Youngjoon: I wanted to express my frustration even like this)

746
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:34,020
(Youngjoon: I never thought I'd make a ring here)

747
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:41,980
(Youngjoon: I don't think it's something you do at the flirting phase)

748
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,690
Yes.
(Youngjoon: I don't think it's something you do at the flirting phase)

749
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,700
(Youngjoon: So, I'm happy,)

750
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,500
(Youngjoon: but I'm afraid this ring might become burdensome)

751
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,220
-You'll feel restrained. -Yes. That might happen.
(Youngjoon: but I'm afraid this ring might become burdensome)

752
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,980
(Youngjoon: So we'll wear it today)

753
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,340
(Youngjoon: But if...)

754
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,500
(Youngjoon: We won't always get to go on dates)

755
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,180
(Youngjoon: It's more likely that we'd go on dates with other people)

756
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:08,820
(Youngjoon: Then... It's up to you)

757
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,600
(Youngjoon: Whether you want to wear the ring)

758
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:09,620
-Oh the ring? -Yes.
(Youngjoon: Whether you want to wear the ring)

759
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,790
-Oh the ring? -Yes.

760
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,600
Okay.

761
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:17,260
(Youngjoon: Let's not be disappointed because of this)
(Hanmin: I agree)

762
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:21,300
(Youngjoon: I'll be wearing it today)

763
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:26,220
(Hanmin: We'll wear it today)
(Youngjoon: Wear it today)

764
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,740
(Youngjoon: I want to keep wearing it)

765
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:34,620
(Youngjoon: Rather than thinking about it myself, I thought to discuss it with him)

766
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,940
(Hanmin: I do feel a bit burdened)

767
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:42,220
(Hanmin: When you go on a date with this (couple ring),)

768
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,660
(Hanmin: how would it feel? Wouldn't it feel burdensome?)

769
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,060
(Hanmin: I felt a little burdened in this aspect)

770
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,980
(Hanmin: This is our first proper date)

771
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,620
(Hanmin: We have a long time ahead)

772
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,340
(Hanmin: Am I excluding (other contestants) too soon?)

773
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:04,090
(Hanmin: But we should follow our heart, express our thoughts and live in the moment)

774
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,470
That's what we concluded.
(Hanmin: But we should follow our heart, express our thoughts and live in the moment)

775
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,380
We've finished the drinks.
(Hanmin: But we should follow our heart, express our thoughts and live in the moment)

776
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:06,560
(Youngjoon: Should we head home?)
(Hanmin: Yeah?)
We've finished the drinks.
(Hanmin: But we should follow our heart, express our thoughts and live in the moment)

777
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,630
(Youngjoon: Should we head home?)
(Hanmin: Yeah?)

778
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,080
-Go home? Okay. -Okay.
(Youngjoon: Should we head home?)
(Hanmin: Yeah?)

779
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,820
(Youngjoon: Should we head home?)
(Hanmin: Yeah?)

780
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,820
(Youngjoon: I wonder what (Hwi & Jaeseung) are doing)

781
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:22,940
(Hanmin: Shouldn't we buy something back?)
(Youngjoon: Should we buy something?)

782
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:27,300
(Youngjoon: Let's show off our rings and tease them)
(Hanmin: Okay)

783
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,620
(Youngjoon: Let's go)
(Hanmin: Let's go)

784
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,540
(Youngjoon: To rate today's date...)

785
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,420
(200 points out of 100 points)

786
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:41,180
(What will happen to the two who have similar but also differing thoughts?)

787
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,740
(Men's House)

788
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,660
(Hwi: We're wearing white. Be careful not to have it splash at us)

789
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,940
(Jaeseung: We have to change anyway. To exercise)

790
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,860
(Hwi: Are we really doing it?)

791
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,340
(Jaeseung: For real)

792
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,580
(Hwi: I'm really bad at it)

793
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,260
(Jaeseung: Because of your joke)

794
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,180
(Cute)

795
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,300
(Hwi: What can we do there?)

796
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,900
(Jaeseung: Because there are yoga mats and foam rollers,)

797
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:08,580
(Jaeseung: we can do a massage and stretch)

798
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,100
(Jaeseung: Mm... Squats?)

799
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,020
(Hwi: No, squats are embarrassing(?))
(Jaeseung: Why?)

800
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,180
(Hwi: The squat pose is so embarrassing)

801
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,980
(Jaeseung: What do you mean by that?)

802
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:22,980
(Hwi: Not squats. Teach me how to use dumbbells)
(Jaeseung: Dumbbells?)

803
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:28,060
(Jaeseung: Dumbbells...)

804
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,980
(Hwi: Exercising...I’m screwed)

805
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,660
(Jaeseung: Or what about lunges?)

806
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,500
(Hwi: Lunges?)

807
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,020
(Jaeseung: Sitting down with one leg and then getting up)

808
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,500
(Jaeseung: That's more tiring than squats)

809
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,700
(Jaeseung: You might ask me to let you do squats instead)

810
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:42,940
(Hwi: I signed up for six months' worth of personal training at a gym)
(Jaeseung: And you didn't go?)

811
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:47,140
(Hwi: I didn’t go after three or four times)
(Jaeseung: Really?)

812
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,620
(Hwi: I really... remember that time...)

813
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,540
(Gentle) (Jaeseung: I won't let you sweat a lot)

814
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,900
(Gentle)

815
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,620
(Jaeseung: I'll try my best though)

816
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,180
(Hwi: Ah, I'm scared)

817
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,580
(Jaeseung: Fix (the foam roller) in place (with your feet))

818
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:13,540
(Jaeseung: Place (your foot) on top)

819
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:19,220
(Jaeseung: Roll forward and back in this state. Like this)

820
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:24,580
(Hwi: Oh, it's comfortable)
(Jaeseung: Isn't it?)

821
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,740
(Jaeseung: It feels like I've become a personal trainer again)

822
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,180
(Hwi: I feel like I'm taking personal training lessons again)

823
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,660
(Hwi: I feel like a mermaid)

824
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,870
(Jaeseung: In fact, in this way, it doesn't hurt that much)

825
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:37,780
So I'll press it down. Press it down.
(Jaeseung: In fact, in this way, it doesn't hurt that much)

826
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,350
So I'll press it down. Press it down.

827
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,360
-Press it down and rub it. -Wait.

828
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,480
-Press it down like this. -It really hurts.

829
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,940
(Jaeseung: It should hurt like this)

830
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,660
(Hwi: In the opposite direction too?)
(Jaeseung: Yes)

831
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,860
(Jaeseung: Did you want to have a date at home today?)

832
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,650
I was out for very long yesterday.

833
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:05,420
(Hwi: I didn't dislike the idea of a date at home)

834
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,660
(Jaeseung: Don't you want to have a delicious lunch?)

835
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,860
(Hwi: Delicious lunch?)

836
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,260
(Hwi: Because I didn’t have a proper lunch yesterday)

837
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:18,740
(Jaeseung: I may not want to go out for lunch for the time being)

838
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:21,060
(Jaeseung: Yesterday's food was really good)

839
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:25,220
(Hwi: Half-dried pollack?)
(Jaeseung: Yes. and spicy ribs)

840
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,900
(Hwi: Half-dried pollack...)

841
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,220
(Jaeseung: I love Korean food more than Western food)
(Hwi: really? Do you like Korean food the most?)

842
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,700
(Jaeseung: I love Korean food the most)

843
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:37,460
(Hwi: I love Japanese food the most)
(Jaeseung: Really? I like Japanese food too)

844
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,740
(Hwi: Japanese food, like sushi)

845
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,230
(They find out each other's preferences)

846
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:46,900
-Let's do your upper body this time. -Yes.
(They find out each other's preferences)

847
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:47,500
Put it under the armpit.

848
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,980
(Jaeseung teaches another pose)
Put it under the armpit.

849
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,460
(Jaeseung teaches another pose)

850
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,660
(Jaeseung: Look at me. This way)

851
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,420
(Jaeseung: Roll it like this)

852
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,260
(Shy)

853
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,380
(Hwi: So funny)

854
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,980
(Jaeseung: Are you laughing because you're shy or what?)

855
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,780
(Hwi: Shy)

856
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,740
(Hwi: This part is quite tense)

857
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:11,580
(Jaeseung: Do you have someone you like the most in this house?)

858
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,260
(Jaeseung: Is it a secret?)

859
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,380
(Hwi: My first choice is a secret)

860
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,380
(Jaeseung changes his pose)

861
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,240
Change poses?
(Jaeseung changes his pose)

862
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,120
How?
(Jaeseung changes his pose)

863
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,300
(Jaeseung: Like this now)

864
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,900
(Hwi: Like this?)

865
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:25,470
Roll it.

866
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,580
(Hwi: This is really comfortable)

867
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,620
(Hwi: So I was saying...)

868
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,460
(Hwi: My first choice is a secret)

869
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:38,780
(Hwi: I've always said that you're my second choice)
(Jaeseung: I see...)

870
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:43,820
(Jaeseung: I expected Hwi to have someone else in his heart)

871
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,420
(Jaeseung: If I'm the second-place person he's interested in, who's in the first place?)

872
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,580
(Jaeseung: I have no idea)

873
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:55,180
(Jaeseung: Then during yesterday's call session,)

874
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:59,220
(Jaeseung: did you call your first choice?)

875
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,420
(Hwi: Well... I did)

876
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,700
(Hwi: Who did you call yesterday?)

877
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:12,060
(Jaeseung: I called Seongmin yesterday)
(Hwi: Who?)

878
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,460
(Jaeseung: Seongmin)
(Hwi: Oh...)

879
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,020
(Hwi: To be honest, I was upset)

880
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:22,420
(Hwi: I didn't expect him to make that call)

881
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:29,580
(Hwi: Is Seongmin also interested in Jaeseung?)

882
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:40,260
(Jaeseung: I thought you'd call me yesterday)
(Hwi: I'm sorry...)

883
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:44,180
(Jaeseung: So when we were shooting spotlights yesterday,)

884
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,620
(Jaeseung: I was in a good mood)

885
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,860
(Spotlights?)

886
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:51,570
(Awkwardly laughing) (Jaeseung: Not spotlights, but polaroids)

887
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:52,920
Polaroids.
(Awkwardly laughing) (Jaeseung: Not spotlights, but polaroids)

888
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,980
(Awkwardly laughing) (Jaeseung: Not spotlights, but polaroids)

889
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,340
(You're nervous)

890
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,940
(Whatever. Whatever. Whatever. Whatever)

891
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,870
(They all sound the same to me)

892
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,090
Spotlights...
(They all sound the same to me)

893
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:09,700
But at that time, my heart was fluttering.

894
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:09,860
(Jaeseung: I wanted to tell you this)
But at that time, my heart was fluttering.

895
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:13,380
(Jaeseung: I wanted to tell you this)

896
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:20,580
(Hwi: I'm so shy)

897
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:24,020
(Jaeseung: Aren't you the "playful tofu"? Why are you so shy?)

898
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:25,390
(Forced ending) (Thank you for the session)

899
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:26,430
Thank you.
(Forced ending) (Thank you for the session)

900
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:27,090
Already?
(Forced ending) (Thank you for the session)

901
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,060
(Forced ending) (Thank you for the session)

902
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:31,700
(Jaeseung: It's time to start exercising. Get up)

903
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:36,300
(Start exercising now)

904
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,180
(Jaeseung: We'll do squats)

905
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:44,940
(Thoughtful) (Jaeseung: No, stay where you are. I'll put the chair here for you)

906
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,370
(Thoughtful) (Jaeseung: There's a chair behind you, right)
(Hwi: Oh)

907
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:48,660
Just sit down. That's right.
(Thoughtful) (Jaeseung: There's a chair behind you, right)
(Hwi: Oh)

908
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,350
Just sit down. That's right.

909
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,700
(Jaeseung: Stand up. Good)

910
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:59,660
(Jaeseung: This is how grandparents move)

911
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,620
(Goodness)

912
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:05,060
(Jaeseung: It feels like this when I teach)

913
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,580
(Jaeseung: Look ahead, lower your chin,)

914
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:12,460
(Jaeseung: and sit back in this state. Good)

915
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:15,420
(Sits right down)

916
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,980
-No, wait. -Wait.
(Sits right down)

917
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:16,790
-No, wait. -Wait.

918
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,980
(Don't sit down completely)

919
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,740
(Hwi: Just a warm up)

920
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,270
(Jaeseung: Don't sit down completely)

921
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:23,060
Okay, okay.
(Jaeseung: Don't sit down completely)

922
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:23,580
(Jaeseung: Don't sit down completely)

923
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:26,300
(Jaeseung: Here. Down. Sit down)

924
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,000
(Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down)

925
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:32,020
(Jaeseung: Wait, get up first. Starting from the soles of your feet...)

926
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,940
(Hwi: It's tight here)
(Jaeseung: It'd feel tight)

927
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,460
(Hwi: Is it normal?)
(Jaeseung: It's normal to feel tight)

928
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,060
(Jaeseung: Sit down. Let's try ten times)

929
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,780
(Jaeseung: Down. Chest out. Down. Sit down)

930
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:43,940
(Jaeseung: Okay)

931
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,740
(Hwi: I think I did a good job)

932
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,140
(Jaeseung: Much better than before)

933
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:47,970
(That's right. Two)

934
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:48,100
Lower your chin.
(That's right. Two)

935
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:48,300
Lower your chin.

936
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:48,930
(Jaeseung teaches the posture meticulously)
Lower your chin.

937
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:49,310
(Jaeseung teaches the posture meticulously)

938
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:50,320
One. One.
(Jaeseung teaches the posture meticulously)

939
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,320
One. One.
(Jaeseung teaches the posture meticulously)

940
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:51,890
The soles of your feet.

941
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:54,860
Up. Two, three.

942
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,140
One, two, three, four, five, go.

943
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,020
(Patting)
One, two, three, four, five, go.

944
00:45:59,020 --> 00:45:59,530
One, two, three, four, five, go.

945
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,200
Down.

946
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:02,780
Breathe in as you stand up.

947
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,180
(Shy)
Breathe in as you stand up.

948
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,390
Breathe in as you stand up.

949
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:08,380
(Hwi: I must look so funny now)

950
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,180
(Jaeseung: I don't know either)

951
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,500
(Hwi: He asked me to look ahead)

952
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:15,420
(Hwi: But his eyes are right across me)

953
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,780
(Looking around) (Hwi: So I kept avoiding his gaze)

954
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,490
Down.

955
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:22,740
(Hwi: How many times left? Two?)

956
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,080
(Jaeseung: You interrupted my count and I forgot)

957
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:24,500
Two more?
(Jaeseung: You interrupted my count and I forgot)

958
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:24,520
(Jaeseung: Let's reset, yeah? Down)
Two more?
(Jaeseung: You interrupted my count and I forgot)

959
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,740
(Jaeseung: Let's reset, yeah? Down)

960
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:28,860
(Hwi: Oh no)

961
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,580
(Jaeseung: Lower your chin. Down)

962
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:32,710
(Wait. Down)

963
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:33,820
-Just five times. -Okay.
(Wait. Down)

964
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:33,980
-Just five times. -Okay.

965
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:34,550
(They get closer through the excuse of exercise)
-Just five times. -Okay.

966
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:37,580
Up. Exhale. Two.
(They get closer through the excuse of exercise)

967
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,860
(Hwi: We were so close. My face was getting hot)

968
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,580
(Hwi: I wanted (the exercise) to end sooner)

969
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:48,420
(Shy Hwi: After all, I'm just human. So... yeah...)

970
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,450
Up. Exhale.

971
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:54,030
(Jaeseung: Okay, the last time)

972
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:54,060
Up. Exhale.
(Jaeseung: Okay, the last time)

973
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,410
Up. Exhale.

974
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,940
(Okay)

975
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,340
(Jaeseung: Well done)

976
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:05,100
(Hwi: (My forehead) is sweating)

977
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,540
(Jaeseung: This is bad. I'm not sweating at all)

978
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:13,700
(Jaeseung: He was cute. Because when I see that he doesn't know how to do it,)

979
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,620
(Jaeseung: I wanted to teach him)

980
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,620
(Jaeseung: and tease him too)

981
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:21,700
(Jaeseung: He was cute)

982
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,580
(Hwi: Any moves whiles lying down? To work the lower body)

983
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:27,100
(Jaeseung: Lower body exercise while lying down?)

984
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,300
(Hwi: Like an air bicycle)

985
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,140
(Jaeseung: An air bicycle doesn't work the lower body)
(Hwi: Really?)

986
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,140
(Jaeseung: It works the abs. Do you want to do ab exercises?)

987
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,580
(Jaeseung: You might hate it more)
(No)

988
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:40,980
(Hwi: Very simple and easy moves that everyone can do)

989
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,940
(Jaeseung: Why do I keep...)

990
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,060
(Jaeseung: It's weird. Am I a pervert?)

991
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:48,380
(Jaeseung: Why do I want you to make you do tiring and difficult moves?)

992
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,500
(Jaeseung: What's going on? I shouldn't be like this)

993
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,700
(Jaeseung: Then come here)

994
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:01,740
(Jaeseung: The 3 kg dumbbell isn't that heavy)

995
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:06,350
(Jaeseung: Lift the dumbbells slightly)

996
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:07,060
Lower your chin in this state.
(Jaeseung: Lift the dumbbells slightly)

997
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:07,260
Lower your chin in this state.

998
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,180
(Looking at each other for the next exercise again)
Lower your chin in this state.

999
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:11,740
Lift it up and exhale.

1000
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,180
(Hwi does well this time)
Lift it up and exhale.

1001
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:13,440
(Hwi does well this time)

1002
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,260
Down. Inhale.
(Hwi does well this time)

1003
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:15,340
(Hwi: This is quite easy)
Down. Inhale.
(Hwi does well this time)

1004
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:15,900
(Hwi: This is quite easy)

1005
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,220
(Up!)

1006
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,820
(Exhale~ Down)

1007
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:20,820
(Getting closer)

1008
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:21,850
Up.
(Getting closer)

1009
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:22,780
(Getting closer)

1010
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:27,620
(Jaeseung: Raise it with your arm alone)

1011
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,820
(Jaeseung: Up!)

1012
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:33,460
(Jaeseung: Good. Your muscle's showing)

1013
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,740
(Up!)

1014
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:36,660
(I think I'm pretty good)

1015
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,880
Very good.
(I think I'm pretty good)

1016
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:41,740
(Jaeseung: You're best at this arm exercise so far)

1017
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,520
(Hwi: Hasn't it been three times?)
(Jaeseung: This is the last time)

1018
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,870
-Okay. -Okay.
(Hwi: Hasn't it been three times?)
(Jaeseung: This is the last time)

1019
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,220
(Ha...) (Jaeseung: Try the other arm too)

1020
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,820
(Jaeseung: I don't think your shoulders are strong)

1021
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:50,980
(Jaeseung: But your arms seem good)

1022
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:54,140
(Hwi: How many times should I do this? Three times?)

1023
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,790
(Jaeseung: I don't want to be a liar. Just do it~)

1024
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:59,310
Okay. Up.
(Jaeseung: I don't want to be a liar. Just do it~)

1025
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:03,100
(Hwi: I thought (Jaeseung) would be silent and dull)

1026
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,820
(Hwi: I found that he's humorous too)

1027
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:08,740
(Jaeseung: Last time. Up!)

1028
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,740
(Jaeseung: Okay. Stop. Okay)

1029
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:11,940
(Jaeseung: Have you ever hurt your wrist?)

1030
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,780
(Hwi: I had surgery on my arm)

1031
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,900
(Jaeseung: That's why)

1032
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,870
Okay.
(Jaeseung: That's why)

1033
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:17,540
(Jaeseung: That's why)

1034
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:20,660
(Hwi: What a great exercise session)

1035
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:25,700
(Jaeseung: Unfortunately, this is the end of exercise)

1036
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,260
(Jaeseung: I didn't sweat at all)

1037
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,860
(Jaeseung: You clean up faster than anyone else)

1038
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,660
(Hwi: I have to hurry back in)

1039
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:36,140
(Hwi: I think today's weather is too humid)

1040
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,820
(Hwi: It’s not suitable for exercising)

1041
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:43,540
(Rushes away) (Jaeseung: Really? It doesn't feel humid to me at all)

1042
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,060
(After the simple and hot(?) exercise)

1043
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,300
(Therapeutic time for the two men)

1044
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,780
(Hwi: I want to lie on the float)

1045
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,500
(Jaeseung: What if you fall into the water while trying?)

1046
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,770
(Jaeseung: Lie down)

1047
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:57,770
No.
(Jaeseung: Lie down)

1048
00:49:57,770 --> 00:49:59,340
(Jaeseung: Lie down)

1049
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:04,420
(Jaeseung: Yes, it should be safe to lie down there)

1050
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:05,700
I'm scared.

1051
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:10,660
(Should I push it for you?)

1052
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,740
(Hwi: Oh. It's done)

1053
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,380
(Jaeseung: You look good)

1054
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:22,180
(Jaeseung: Where's the polaroid camera?)

1055
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:25,940
(Hwi: I'll take a nap)

1056
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:29,060
(One-day photographer Jaeseung completing the vibe with the bubbles)

1057
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,500
(Hwi: I have bubbles on my feet)

1058
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,700
(Hwi: How is it?)

1059
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:45,740
Can you take a picture of this for me?
(Hwi: How is it?)

1060
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:45,780
Can you take a picture of this for me?

1061
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,040
(Bubble)
Can you take a picture of this for me?

1062
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,620
(Bubble)

1063
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,460
(Hwi: Don’t you think it’s cute?)

1064
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,580
(Jaeseung: Let's (make more bubbles) one more time)

1065
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,820
(Working hard)

1066
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,540
I think this one is the best.

1067
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:03,810
(Hwi: This photo turned out really well)

1068
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,010
Isn't it good?
(Hwi: This photo turned out really well)

1069
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:05,620
(Hwi: This photo turned out really well)

1070
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,820
(Jaeseung: Oh, I almost fell in)

1071
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:10,060
(Hwi: I'll go up and take photos for you)

1072
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,660
(Hwi: I was a little surprised and enjoyed it)

1073
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,460
(Hwi: Enjoyed... A little...)

1074
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,140
(Hwi: I got a little excited)

1075
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,700
(Hwi: So this is how you flirt)

1076
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:27,580
(Take a deep breath) (Hwi: I really can’t do it that way)

1077
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:32,060
(Jaeseung: Will a rubber duck filled with water sink?)
(Hwi: Wouldn't it?)

1078
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,900
(Spraying)

1079
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:37,500
Wait.

1080
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,040
(Hey)
Wait.

1081
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:38,660
(Hey)

1082
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:43,510
(Hwi: Did it hit your face?)

1083
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:44,580
Your face...
(Hwi: Did it hit your face?)

1084
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:44,820
I didn't spray it to my face.

1085
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,260
(Jaeseung: I didn't aim (the water gun) at your face)
I didn't spray it to my face.

1086
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:49,220

(Serene)

1090
00:51:55,580 --> 00:52:03,220
(Hwi: How about the loser makes our snacks?)
(Jaeseung: You want croffles?)

1091
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,820
(Jaeseung: The one who pushes the most off)

1092
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:09,420
(Hwi: When it's pushed off...)
(Jaeseung: You win?)

1093
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,970
(A water gun game to decide who makes snacks)

1094
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:11,950
How about this?
(A water gun game to decide who makes snacks)

1095
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:13,380
(A water gun game to decide who makes snacks)

1096
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,020
(Jaeseung: Let's see who can shoot them off the quickest)

1097
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,380
(Hwi: Take turns? Okay)

1098
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,780
Let's see who can shoot them off the quickest.
(Hwi: Take turns? Okay)

1099
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,900
(Ready...)

1100
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,420
(Jaeseung: Wait. Don't go forward)

1101
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:29,540
(Hwi: Should I shoot from here? Okay)

1102
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,940
(Ready, go!)

1103
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,540
(Oh?)

1104
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,540
(Jaeseung: It didn't move)

1105
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:34,490
One.
(Jaeseung: It didn't move)

1106
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:34,940
(Jaeseung: It didn't move)

1107
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,220
(Hwi: The second one moved)

1108
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,980
(Jaeseung: I didn't see it)

1109
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:40,150
Three.

1110
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,410
-This... -That didn't move.

1111
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,570
Four.

1112
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:45,980
(Hwi: Didn't it move?)

1113
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:49,460
(Jaeseung: No, no, no. It didn't count)

1114
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:55,620
(Smile)

1115
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:57,700
Five.

1116

(Done)
Five.

1117
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,390
-Okay. -Okay.
(Done)

1118
00:52:59,390 --> 00:52:59,980
(Done)

1119
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:03,380
(Jaeseung: 25.8 seconds)
(Hwi: 25 seconds? That's decent)

1120
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,780
(Jaeseung: I think I'll lose. I have a bad feeling)

1121
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,680
25 seconds.
(Jaeseung: I think I'll lose. I have a bad feeling)

1122
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:06,820
Although it's pretty good.

1123

(Jaeseung refills the water gun and Hwi sorts the ducks)
Although it's pretty good.

1126

(Jaeseung: Ready...)
(Hwi: Wait, wait, wait)

1127
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,740
Ready.

1128
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,060
(Start!)

1129
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,110
(Trying hard) (Gosh, I'm seriously...)

1130
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:26,040
I'm really...
(Trying hard) (Gosh, I'm seriously...)

1131
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,420
(I won)

1132
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,700
(I think I screwed up)

1133
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,540
(Jaeseung: You'll just win like that?)

1134
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,940
(Jaeseung: I got ahead of myself)

1135
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,420
(Indignant) (Jaeseung: Wait. The ducks are arranged differently)

1136
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,500
(Jaeseung: Yours were close together)

1137
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,700
(Jaeseung: Mine are too far apart)

1138
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,420
(Feeling wronged)

1139
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:53,660
(Hwi: Jaeseung, you can make our snacks)

1140
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:57,220
(Hwi wins the water gun game)

1141
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:00,780
(Hwi: Ah, really... You're really bad at it)

1142
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:03,860
(Jaeseung: It was kind of cute)

1143
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,540
(Jaeseung: Maybe because I haven't played in the pool in a long time...)

1144
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:14,420
(Or if I really liked Hwi)

1145
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:20,420
(Jaeseung: Actually... I'm not sure)

1146
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,020
(Jaeseung: I really had fun (with Hwi))

1147
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:29,340
(The two spend a refreshing time like the summer sunrays)

1148
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:33,420
You've been driving for eight months... for two years?

1149
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,100
(Seungjin: Around my second year?)

1150
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,900
(Seungjin: I'll lead today)

1151
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,740
(Seongmin: So cool)

1152
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:46,780
(Seongmin: I had a really tough time yesterday)

1153
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:52,420
(Seongmin: I just wanted to sleep without thinking about anything)

1154
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:55,020
(Seongmin: I'm physically tired too)

1155
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:59,580
(Seongmin: I called the person I wanted to call, Jaeseung)

1156
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:02,820
(Seongmin: Then I got a call from Jaeseung, but it didn't make me happy)

1157
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:04,060
(Seungjin: Really?)

1158
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,780
(Seongmin: I wanted to tell him I want to get closer)

1159
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:08,100
(Seongmin: and hoped he wouldn't call me)

1160
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,460
(Seongmin: I feel like I've let Hwi down too)

1161
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:14,570
(Seongmin: Well, I can't say I wasn't happy at all)

1162
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:14,940
Yeah.
(Seongmin: Well, I can't say I wasn't happy at all)

1163
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:15,130
(Seongmin: I just feel a little uncomfortable... How should I put it?)
Yeah.
(Seongmin: Well, I can't say I wasn't happy at all)

1164
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:17,740
(Seongmin: I just feel a little uncomfortable... How should I put it?)

1165
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:19,700
(Seungjin: The situation was uncomfortable)

1166
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,180
(Seongmin: Yes. I felt really uncomfortable)

1167
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:24,220
(Seongmin: But we talked a lot before sleep yesterday)

1168
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:31,980
(Seongmin: There are a lot of people in Men's House you want to date, right?)

1169
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,260
(Seungjin: Until yesterday...)

1170
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:40,620
(Seungjin: I wanted to go on a date with Jaeseung)
(Seongmin: Jaeseung?)

1171
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:42,940
(Seungjin: I did have (a date with Jaeseung))

1172
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,980
(Seungjin: What I thought yesterday was...)

1173
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:49,020
(Seungjin: Since there's a difference in interest)

1174
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,940
(Seungjin: and starting points,)

1175
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:54,740
(Seungjin: regardless of romantic feelings,)

1176
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:59,780
(Seungjin: I was more interested in him as an older brother)

1177
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:04,220
(Seungjin: If I get to know (Jaeseung) better and get along well,)

1178
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:08,580
(Seungjin: we can build a good relationship. It would be a good thing)

1179
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,420
(Seungjin: That's what I thought)

1180
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:15,580
(Seungjin: But after hearing Jaeseung's age yesterday...)

1181
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,420
(Seungjin: But honestly, yesterday I...)

1182
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,580
(Seungjin: After hearing that Jaeseung's old,)
(Seongmin: You liked it)

1183
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:23,540
(Seungjin: I became more interested in him)

1184
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:26,900
(Seungjin: But after that...)

1185
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,900
(Seungjin: This thought suddenly flashed in my head)

1186
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:32,700
(Seungjin: He might be uncomfortable with me)

1187
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,420
(Seungjin: Because I'm too young, it might make him uncomfortable)

1188
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:38,820
(Seungjin: Or maybe I'm still just a kid in his eyes)

1189
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:40,220
(Seungjin: I also thought that way)

1190
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:45,100
(Seungjin: Other than that, I might not be his type too)

1191
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,100
(Seongmin: But you prefer older men, right?)
(Seungjin: Yes, I like older men)

1192
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,820
(Seungjin: But I always have this query)
(Seongmin: What is it?)

1193
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:54,620
(Seungjin: What am I to them? Why did they...)
(Seongmin: They broke up after a short time?)

1194
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,180
(Seungjin: That aside,)

1195
00:56:56,180 --> 00:57:02,420
(Seungjin: my thoughts and actions are childish...)
(Seongmin: No, 31 and 32 year olds are the same)

1196
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:07,390
(Seungjin: But I really felt it...)
(Seongmin: Mentally... Mentally, I'm still a kid)

1197
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:07,420
Based on my mental age, I'm still a kid.
(Seungjin: But I really felt it...)
(Seongmin: Mentally... Mentally, I'm still a kid)

1198
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:09,520
Based on my mental age, I'm still a kid.

1199
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,660
(Seongmin: I need people to take care of me)

1200
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:17,740
(Seungjin: That has nothing to do with age)

1201
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:21,460
(Seungjin: Some people are born like that. It can't be changed)

1202
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:21,740
(Through an honest conversation, Seongmin and Seungjin get closer)

1203
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:22,580
Yes.
(Through an honest conversation, Seongmin and Seungjin get closer)

1204
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:23,090
(Through an honest conversation, Seongmin and Seungjin get closer)

1205
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:25,910
I understand their troubles. They don't want to be like that either.
(Through an honest conversation, Seongmin and Seungjin get closer)

1206
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:26,920
Right.
(Through an honest conversation, Seongmin and Seungjin get closer)

1207
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,260
(Through an honest conversation, Seongmin and Seungjin get closer)

1208
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:31,340
(Seongmin: I'm hungry)

1209
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:32,260
(Seongmin: Aren't you hungry?)

1210
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:32,820
(Seungjin: I'm hungry)

1211
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:37,660
(Seongmin: Let's eat something delicious)
(Seungjin: I'd like that)

1212
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,860
(Seongmin & Seungjin's date is at a brunch cafe surrounded by greenery)

1213
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,580
(Seongmin: What do you want to eat? What kind of food do you like?)

1214
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,740
(Seungjin: Food like pasta?)
(Seongmin: Pasta?)

1215
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:50,660
(Seungjin: I really want to hear this song)
(Seongmin: What song?)

1216
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:54,260
(Seungjin: ♫These fingers are not a V but an S♫)

1217
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,180
(Seungjin: ♫The two 'S'es for Sorry♫)

1218
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,900
(Seungjin: Don't you know this song?)
(Seongmin: No. Is it a Reels song?)

1219
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:01,300
(Seungjin: ♫This is bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh♫)
(Seongmin: I don't like Gen Z songs)

1220
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,850
(Unyielding Gen-Z)

1221
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:05,590
♫Wiping my tears dry♫
(Unyielding Gen-Z)

1222
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:06,900
(Seongmin: Oh? Isn't it that song?)

1223
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,780
(Seungjin: ♫So sad♫)
(Seongmin: Is it from an animation?)

1224
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:13,820
(Seungjin: That's right. There's a tomato)
(Seongmin: I think I saw it)

1225
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,380
(Seongmin: There's greenery everywhere. It's soothing)
(Seungjin: I know)

1226
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:23,420
(Seongmin: If you had to, who do you want as a roommate?)

1227
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,980
(Seongmin: You aren't allowed to stay in a single room)

1228
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:30,060
(Seungjin: If there's no single room?)
(Seongmin: A minimum of a double room)

1229
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:32,700
(Seungjin: If it was yesterday,)

1230
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:36,020
(Seungjin: I'd pick Youngjoon)
(Seongmin: What about today?)

1231
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:38,540
(Seungjin: If I were to choose (roommates) today, I'd choose you)

1232
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,860
(Oh?)

1233
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:44,340
(Seungjin: Yesterday, we got closer rapidly)
(Seongmin: Me too, really)

1234
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:47,700
(Seongmin: If I've to choose a roommate out of the 8 other than Hwi)
(Seungjin: If you had to change...)

1235
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:51,540
(Seongmin: I didn't expect we'd get along so well)
(Seungjin: Me too)

1236
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:52,220
(Seongmin: Really)

1237
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:58,940
(Seongmin: We suddenly got really close while chatting yesterday)
(Seungjin: That's right)

1238
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,700
(Seongmin: And at the same time,)

1239
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:03,580
(Seongmin: we called the same person, (Jaeseung))

1240
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:07,180
(Seongmin and Seungjin both know they called Jaeseung yesterday)

1241
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:10,660
(Seungjin: It's nice)

1242
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,060
(Seongmin: Interesting)

1243
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:15,780
(Seungjin: So you called Hwi on the first day)
(Seongmin: Me?)

1244
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,300
(Seungjin: I thought you called Jaeseung)

1245
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,620
(Seungjin: On the first day)
(Seongmin: Why?)

1246
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:22,100
(Seungjin: Because (Jaeseung & Seongmin) first met together)

1247
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,580
(Seongmin: But I was considering it)

1248
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:25,420
(Seongmin: I was conflicted between Jaeseung and Hwi for a long time)

1249
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:28,220
(Seongmin: But after sharing a room with Hwi,)

1250
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:29,940
(Seongmin: Hwi...)

1251
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,860
(Seungjin: When I was going to sleep yesterday,)

1252
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,700
(Seungjin: I heard (you & Hwi) chatting for a long time in the room)

1253
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:38,100
(Dumbfounded) (Seongmin: Huh? You heard it?)

1254
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:41,340
(Seungjin: I couldn't hear what you said. Just your voices)

1255
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:43,140
(Seungjin: You guys didn't sleep)

1256
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:47,140
(Seongmin: Yes, we were chatting. The lights were off)

1257
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:49,780
(Seongmin: He said he had something to say, so we had a chat)
(Seungjin: What did you talk about?)

1258
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,620
(Seongmin: It's a secret)

1259
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:57,940
(Seongmin: It's a secret)
(Seungjin: Okay. I get it)

1260
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:02,420
(Seongmin: Oh... You heard us talking...)

1261
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,100
(The long-awaited brunch is served)

1262
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,220
Wow.
(The long-awaited brunch is served)

1263
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:06,860
(The long-awaited brunch is served)

1264
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,220
(Seongmin: Thank you)
(Seungjin: Thank you)

1265
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:12,540
-Thank you. -Enjoy.

1266
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:15,740
(Looks delicious)

1267
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,140
(Seungjin: Shall we take a picture?)
(Seongmin: Yeah?)

1268
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:24,950
(Seongmin: Should we move this?)
(Seungjin: No, just leave it there)

1269
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:26,590
Okay, like this.
(Seongmin: Should we move this?)
(Seungjin: No, just leave it there)

1270
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:27,810
(Seongmin: Should we move this?)
(Seungjin: No, just leave it there)

1271
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:28,730
Me too.
(Seongmin: Should we move this?)
(Seungjin: No, just leave it there)

1272
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:30,420
(Seungjin: Show off to them when we get back, that we had something delicious)

1273
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:33,380
(Seungjin: Let's have a battle)
(Seongmin: Okay)

1274
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,780
(Seungjin: Take a picture to make it look unappetizing)

1275
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:37,660
(Oh, I can do it) (Can you do it?)

1276
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:41,620
(Seongmin: Make it look unappetizing? I can do it)

1277
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:45,900
(Two men focused on getting the most unappetizing picture)

1278
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,250
(Seongmin: I'm done. Unappetizing picture)
(Seungjin: Show me)

1279
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:49,340
-Hey. -What?
(Seongmin: I'm done. Unappetizing picture)
(Seungjin: Show me)

1280
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:50,450
-Hey. -What?

1281
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:55,120
(Seungjin's sandwich picture) (Seungjin: This is how you do it)

1282
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,070
What did you do?
(Seungjin's sandwich picture) (Seungjin: This is how you do it)

1283
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,740
(Shaking his head)

1284
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:03,140
(The owner would hate that photo)

1285
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:07,500
(A delicious dish that can't be hidden)

1286
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:12,140
(Have some coffee) (Okay)

1287
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,220
(Let's have a drink)

1288
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:15,820
Eat gracefully.

1289
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:15,830
(A big bite)
Eat gracefully.

1290
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:19,180
(A big bite)

1291
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,540
(Seungjin: Yesterday's date was kind of exciting,)

1292
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:26,460
(Seungjin: but I also felt like it's the start)

1293
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:30,180
(Seungjin: I felt that strongly. Today is different)

1294
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,460
(Seungjin: I feel relaxed)

1295
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:38,020
(Seongmin: I was too nervous yesterday)

1296
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:41,140
(Seongmin: We didn't know each other well yesterday)

1297
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:43,580
(Seongmin: It felt like a battlefield)

1298
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:47,420
(Seongmin: That's why I needed a sense of stability)

1299
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:49,980
(Seongmin: It feels really good to get close to you today)
(Seungjin: Yeah)

1300
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:54,540
(Seungjin: I think so too)

1301
01:01:54,540 --> 01:02:00,540
(Seongmin: Honestly, I've become close with Hwi)

1302
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:03,540
(Seongmin: I've barely met with those in the second and third floors)

1303
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:06,260
(Seongmin: I met Jaeseung at the start)

1304
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:09,420
(Seongmin: I wanted to get close to you from the start)
(Seungjin: Why?)

1305
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:14,260
(Seongmin: From your eyes, I thought we'd be quite similar)
(Seungjin: Mmm)

1306
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:17,660
(Seongmin: So tomorrow,)

1307
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:22,500
(Seongmin: or today, if there's a phone call session, who will you call?)

1308
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:26,940
(Seungjin: First... According to the current situation,)

1309
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:30,100
(Seungjin: I'm very likely to call Jaeseung again)

1310
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,340
(Seongmin: As someone you're interested in?)

1311
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:34,780
(Seungjin: Because I don't feel like I've gained or lost)

1312
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:36,780
(Seungjin: interest in anyone)

1313
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:38,980
(Seongmin: It's only been three days)

1314
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:41,740
(Seungjin: Yes. So I think I'll call Jaeseung again)

1315
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:45,020
(Seongmin: You had a date with Jaeseung, right?)

1316
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:50,860
(Seungjin: He's a sweet man who removes fish bones for me)
(Seongmin: You fell for him?)

1317
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:52,180
(Seungjin: I was really surprised)

1318
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:54,180
(Seungjin: I've never seen anyone)

1319
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,700
(Seungjin: remove fish bones for another adult)
(Seongmin: So cool)

1320
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:01,340
(Seungjin: I was surprised)
(Seongmin: I'd fall for him too)

1321
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:03,940
(Seongmin: So Jaeseung's really sweet)

1322
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:08,420
(Seongmin: I wish he could remove fish bones for me too)

1323
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:15,340
(Seungjin: Who will you call?)

1324
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:19,820
(Seongmin: I don't think I'll call someone I like, but someone I want to know)

1325
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:21,900
(Seungjin: Someone you want to know?)

1326
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:28,220
(Seongmin: Like you, my interests in people haven't changed much)

1327
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:33,500
(Seongmin: Different people, people I want to know, and people I haven't dated)

1328
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,980
(Seongmin: I'm planning to stick to that)
(Seungjin: Oh, nice)

1329
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:39,700
(Seungjin: Do you have anyone in mind?)

1330
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:41,580
(Seongmin: I... Yes)

1331
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:43,940
(Seungjin: You do? You won't tell me, right?)

1332
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:50,940
(Seongmin: Someone I'm interested in?)

1333
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:52,500
(Gosh, I'm so frustrated)

1334
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,220
(Seongmin: You could change your mind too)

1335
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:55,620
(Seungjin: I'm just saying right now,)

1336
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:58,820
(Seungjin: I might call Jaeseung)

1337
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:02,900
(Seungjin: I felt that yesterday)
(Seongmin: Did you feel it yourself?)

1338
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:04,220
(Seungjin: Because I thought Jaeseung...)

1339
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:05,740
(Seungjin: Maybe we'll call)

1340
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:09,940
(Seungjin: each other? Oh, no)

1341
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:12,060
(Seungjin: It didn't happen)

1342
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,020
(Seongmin: After hearing Hwi's age, I felt a bit...)

1343
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:19,020
(Seongmin: I called Hwi on the first day)

1344
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:21,100
(Seongmin: When I heard Hwi's age, I felt a bit bitter inside)

1345
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:23,900
(Seungjin: Why?)
(Seongmin: Because he's 7 years younger than me)

1346
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:28,220
(Seungjin: This is why everyone says age is more important than imagined)

1347
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:31,940
(Seungjin: Honestly, age doesn't matter to me at all)

1348
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,860
(Seungjin: As long as it's older or younger... no...)

1349
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:35,340
(Seungjin: no. As long as he's not younger or the same age as me)

1350
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:39,100
(Seongmin: So you're open to everyone here)

1351
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:42,380
(Seongmin: I prefer someone younger)

1352
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:44,500
(Seongmin: I didn't think Hwi was younger)

1353
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:48,300
(Seongmin: I thought he was around 26)

1354
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:53,220
(Seongmin: But he's 22. So that was really unexpected)

1355
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,580
(Seongmin: So would you like it)

1356
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:57,020
(Seongmin: if someone you didn't like chose you?)

1357
01:04:57,020 --> 01:05:00,140
(Seungjin: Yes. Because he likes me as me...)

1358
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,180
(Seungjin: No matter the reason,)

1359
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:05,700
(Seungjin: if he likes me, I'm grateful)

1360
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:09,180
(Seungjin: But in my opinion,)

1361
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:13,100
(Seungjin: no one's said I'm their type)

1362
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:17,300
(Seungjin: and I'm also young)

1363
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:21,610
(Seungjin thinks no one sees him as a prospective romantic partner)

1364
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:23,710
That's what I think.
(Seungjin thinks no one sees him as a prospective romantic partner)

1365
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:28,340
(Seongmin: Who knows? It's only been three days)

1366
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:31,900
(Seungjin: But three days means half of it has passed)

1367
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:34,860
(Seongmin: Not half yet. There's still a lot of time left)

1368
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:39,580
(Seongmin: Think about it. You've only been on a date with two people)

1369
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:40,620
(Seongmin: Right?)
(Seungjin: That's true)

1370
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:42,020
(Seongmin: There are eight people in total)

1371
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:47,340
(Seongmin: Since we're here, we...)

1372
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:49,820
(Seongmin: should date different people)
(Seungjin: That's right)

1373
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:52,940
(Seongmin: and find someone who really suits us in the process)
(Seungjin: Tight)

1374
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:56,580
(Seongmin: Let's not give up any possibility)

1375
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:57,980
(Seongmin: You gave me that advice)

1376
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:03,900
(Seongmin: Decide after dating as many people as I can. It's not a bad thing)

1377
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:07,140
(Seongmin: Rather than feeling guilty, just (go on dates))
(Seungjin: Yes)

1378
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:11,660
(Seongmin: You too. There are eight men here)

1379
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:13,340
(Seongmin: As you said,)

1380
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:16,500
(Seongmin: we shouldn't give up on any possibility)

1381
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:22,140
(Seungjin: I thought about it for a long time after yesterday)

1382
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:30,980
(Seungjin: I didn't expect to meet someone here)

1383
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:32,660
(Seungjin: who I can have serious conversations with)

1384
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:35,900
(Seungjin: After entering (the cafe), I was impressed)

1385
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:38,580
(Seungjin: by the fact that I have someone)

1386
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:42,460
(Seungjin: to have earnest conversations at ease with)

1387
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:47,300
(Seongmin: Seungjin and my conversations flowed well)

1388
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:50,900
(Seongmin: I felt like we'd be similar since the day before)

1389
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:53,020
(Seongmin: I was right)

1390
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:57,140
(Seongmin: I realized we're quite similar through our conversations)

1391
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:00,500
(I'm so full)

1392
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:04,740
(Seongmin: What is... What is happening at home?)

1393
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:07,690
(Seongmin: Let's go home)

1394
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:08,580
Let's go.
(Seongmin: Let's go home)

1395
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:11,500
(Seungjin: Now...)

1396
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,700
(Seungjin: We're done eating. Let's go home)

1397
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:15,970
Let's go home.
(Seungjin: We're done eating. Let's go home)

1398
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:21,300
(Seongmin and Seungjin's date filled with honest conversations)

1399
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:25,900
(Hwi: I'm curious about something else)
(Jaeseung: What is it?)

1400
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:32,140
(Hwi: After our date today,)

1401
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:35,380
(Hwi: how has your interest in me changed?)

1402
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:39,140
(Jaeseung: How has it changed?)
(Hwi: Has it changed?)

1403
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:44,900
(Jaeseung: But really... Speaking of my feelings for you,)

1404
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:50,100
(Jaeseung: I have to trace back to the beginning)
(Hwi: Why?)

1405
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:53,740
(Jaeseung: I was really interested in you on the first day)

1406
01:07:54,660 --> 01:08:02,540
(Jaeseung: During the second day's dinner, after we revealed our ages,)

1407
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:07,300
(Jaeseung: maybe it started from then or not...)

1408
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,820
(Jaeseung: I felt you were distant)

1409
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:13,620
(Hwi: Really? It's not though...)

1410
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:14,860
(Jaeseung: There's that)

1411
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:19,899
(Jaeseung: Since yesterday, I also thought I shouldn't be interested in you anymore)

1412
01:08:19,899 --> 01:08:25,620
(Jaeseung: I should let it go now. That's what I thought)

1413
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:28,640
(Jaeseung: But I ended up on a date with you again)

1414
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:28,660
Yes.
(Jaeseung: But I ended up on a date with you again)

1415
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:29,550
Yes.

1416
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:34,140
(Jaeseung: In these aspects, I was a bit confused)

1417
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:37,340
(Jaeseung: But then again...)

1418
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:42,380
(I liked your smile)

1419
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:45,580
(Jaeseung: I see your smile from time to time,)

1420
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:48,620
(Jaeseung: so it made my heart flutter)

1421
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:54,660
(Jaeseung: Compared to yesterday, I might be a bit more interested in you now)

1422
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:58,620
(Jaeseung: But I'm not sure if it affects my ranking of who I'm most interested in)

1423
01:08:59,220 --> 01:08:59,430
(Hesitant)

1424
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:00,560
Yesterday...
(Hesitant)

1425
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,819
(Hesitant)

1426
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:04,460
(Hwi: Actually, after dinner yesterday...)

1427
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:07,140
(Hwi: I went out for a date yesterday)

1428
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:13,580
(Hwi: I was too tired, so I didn't talk much)

1429
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:19,420
(Hwi: That’s why I was that way. I didn't mean to avoid you)

1430
01:09:19,979 --> 01:09:22,939
(Jaeseung: I see...)

1431
01:09:22,939 --> 01:09:28,660
(Hwi: But I don't think you're the type to show (your affections) openly)

1432
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:32,620
(Hwi: Maybe I didn’t notice it)

1433
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:37,500
(Hwi: But... Should I say I didn't feel it?)

1434
01:09:38,939 --> 01:09:43,260
(Jaeseung: Maybe I didn't show it enough)

1435
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:51,580
(Jaeseung: It's hard, isn't it?)
(Hwi: I have a lot on my mind)

1436
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:54,860
(Jaeseung: A lot on my mind)
(Hwi: Yes)

1437
01:09:56,100 --> 01:10:00,260
(Jaeseung: What about you? Has your interest in me changed?)

1438
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:07,180
(Hwi: To be honest, compared to yesterday, I'm more interested in you)

1439
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,620
(Jaeseung: Compared to yesterday?)
(Hwi: Yes)

1440
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:17,100
(The two are shy after a sudden love confession)

1441
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:18,450
So frustrating.
(The two are shy after a sudden love confession)

1442

(The two are shy after a sudden love confession)

1443
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:26,420
(Hwi: Ah... I'm bad with saying such things)

1444
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:31,260
(Jaeseung: I knew you're a bit shy)

1445
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:38,940
(Jaeseung: But I wasn't sure if it's because you're not interested in me)

1446
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:48,420
(Jaeseung: or because you aren't good at expressing yourself)

1447
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:51,700
(Jaeseung: I'm quite committed to the idea that)

1448
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:56,980
(Jaeseung: when I have feelings for him, but I don't feel it reciprocated,)

1449
01:10:56,980 --> 01:11:00,260
(Jaeseung: I'll just give up without regrets)

1450
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:05,180
(Hwi: It's really hard)

1451
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:10,060
(Hwi: Then... Why don't we go and check on our Tanghulu?)

1461
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:42,820
(Hwi: What fruits do you like?)
(Jaeseung: I like strawberries and watermelon. I like cherry tomatoes too)

1462
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:44,020
(Do you want one?)

1463
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:46,620
(Bite)

1464
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:51,580

01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:56,740
(Jaeseung: This is stevia cherry tomatoes)
(Hwi: It's my first time trying them. They're so sweet)

1470
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:22,060
(Jaeseung: So did the person you called yesterday... call you back?)

1471
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:28,780
(Hwi: What do you think?)
(Jaeseung: It's hard)

1472
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:33,900
(Jaeseung:I think he called you)
(Hwi: Hmm...)

1473
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:40,980
(Hwi: I’ll keep it a secret)
(Jaeseung: Ah, okay)

1474
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:46,860
(Hwi: I didn't get a single call yesterday. I was a bit embarrassed...)

(Jaeseung: When I asked him to exercise, he hated it so much)

1480
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:14,860
(Jaeseung: When making Tanghulu, he's very eager)

1481

(Jaeseung: Isn't it yummy?)

1482

(Hwi: Which date did you prefer?)
(Jaeseung: Me?)

1524
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:26,780
(Jaeseung: Actually, it's not hard to choose)

1525
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:30,820

1526
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:32,580
(Jaeseung: I prefer today's date)

1527
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:35,700
(Jaeseung: What about you?)

1528
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:40,700
(Jaeseung: Compared to the date with Seongmin yesterday?)

1529
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:48,580
(Hwi: I liked both dates. Because they were two different dates)

1530
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:53,980
(Hwi: Yesterday was a soothing date while resting)

1531
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:59,820
(Hwi: Today's like we’re on a vacation)

1532
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:00,860
(Hwi: So I liked both)

1533
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:04,420
(Jaeseung: Yes, this place feels like a hotel)
(Hwi: Yes)

1534
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:06,540
(Jaeseung: It feels like we aren't in Korea too)
(Hwi: Yes)

1535
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:10,660

1536
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:14,170
(Hwi: It’s a secret)

1537
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:14,220
Giving me nothing.
(Hwi: It’s a secret)

1538
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:14,500
Giving me nothing.

1539
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,090
(Frustrated)
Giving me nothing.

1540
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:17,900
(Frustrated)

1541
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:20,980
(Jaeseung: You don't answer anything)

1542
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:23,140
(Jaeseung: Was it because he's interested in me,)

1543
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:25,140
(Jaeseung: because he didn't want to say it,)

1544
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:29,180
(Jaeseung: or because he's protecting the other's privacy,)

1545
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:31,580
(Jaeseung: that he didn't tell me?)

1546
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:33,820
(Jaeseung: I'm confused)

1547
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:40,260
(Hwi: Then since everyone went on a date today,)

1548
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:42,460
(Hwi: are you bothered by any couples?)

1549
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:44,540
(Jaeseung: Really? I'll keep mine a secret too)

1550
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:48,100
(Hwi: I'll tell you mine too)

1551
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:49,340
(Jaeseung: What is this?)

1552
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,900
(Jaeseung: Then tell me)

1553
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:54,340
(Hwi: It's not that I'm bothered, but...)

1554
01:16:55,060 --> 01:17:01,140
(Hwi: If I had drawn a card earlier, at least I could make a choice)

1555
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:08,260
(Hwi: My roommate picked a card at once. It was a shame)

1556
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:16,420
(Huh?)

1557
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:20,260
(Hwi: So when Seongmin and Seungjin)

1558
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:25,820
(Hwi: went out together, I felt a bit sad)

1559
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:29,500
(Hwi: But when I heard that you were the remaining one,)

1560
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:32,980
(Hwi: I was quite relieved)

1561
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:35,580
(Hwi: I was really curious who'd be left behind)

1562
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:40,220
(Jaeseung: What's going on? I thought Hwi wasn't interested in Seongmin)

1563
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:52,060
(Jaeseung: So for you, it's Seongmin?)
(Hwi: A little?)

1564
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:59,700
(Hwi: What about you? Are you worried about anyone?)
(Jaeseung: It's Seongmin for me too)

1565
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:05,140
(Flustered)

1566
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:09,100
(Sudden silence between the two)

1567
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:20,860
(Hwi: It really felt like the atmosphere suddenly changed)

1568
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:26,940
(Hwi: The atmosphere got cold and tense, and it sort of felt like we're in competition)

1569
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,980
(Hwi: I felt so)

1570
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:40,940
(Jaeseung: To be honest, when you and Seongmin returned from your date yesterday,)

1571
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:44,140
(Jaeseung: I felt kind of jealous)

1572
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:45,100
(Jaeseung: But I'm the same as you)

1573
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:49,420
(Jaeseung: Just like you're second-most interested in me, you were also my second choice)

1574
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:52,340
(Jaeseung: My first choice is Seongmin)

1575
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:57,820
(Jaeseung: But I made you two roommates, and you two went on a date together)

1576
01:18:57,820 --> 01:19:02,660
(Jaeseung: When I saw you two being lovey-dovey,)

1577
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:10,220
(Jaeseung: I thought I might be jealous)

1578
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:12,940
(Jaeseung: That's what I felt)

1579
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:15,860
(Flustered)

1580
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:19,820
(Jaeseung: It overlapped)

1581
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:25,700
(Jaeseung: Will he choose an older man or a younger man?)

1582
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:34,580
(Jaeseung: Or maybe Seongmin has feelings for someone else. Who knows?)
(Hwi: Yeah)

1583
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:38,820
(Jaeseung: Hwi is my rival)

1584
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:46,220
(Jaeseung: but also my second choice. It's very complicated)

1585
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:50,300
(Jaeseung: I was your second choice until yesterday)

1586
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:53,260
(Jaeseung: Today, are you my friendly rival?)

1587
01:19:55,940 --> 01:19:59,380
(A friendly rival? I guess he's not going to give up)

1588
01:19:59,380 --> 01:20:03,380
(Hwi: I thought I have to make it more clear)

1589
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:09,620
(This is what a real love triangle is like)

1590
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:14,660
(Men's House)

1591
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:17,390
You'll be misunderstood.

1592
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:18,540
Then...

1593
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:23,420
(Jaeseung's shocking notice disrupts the men's peace)

1594
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:24,670
-Huh? -Huh?

1595
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:27,980
(Did I hear it wrong? What's going on?)

1596
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:29,860
(I was so shocked)

1597
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:33,340
(So suddenly? You're leaving so suddenly?)

1598
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:37,900
(I was so shocked)

1599
01:20:38,290 --> 01:20:39,960
This is crazy.

1600
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:46,500
(What did I just do?)

1601
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:49,740
(I felt deeply betrayed)

1602
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:53,020
(How could he do that?)

1603
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:53,060
-Is that right? -He must be envious.

1604
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:54,960
(Meanwhile, men in a different atmosphere)
-Is that right? -He must be envious.

1605
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,450
You must be envious.
(Meanwhile, men in a different atmosphere)

1606
01:20:57,540 --> 01:21:00,660
(We're wearing (couple rings), so don't come between us)

1607
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:04,740
(It was annoying. It felt fake)

1608
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:07,620
(Hanmin is not Youngjoon's type)

1609
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:10,700
(According to his ideal type, I'm more his type)

1610
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:15,000
(Can't tell what the men really feel)
