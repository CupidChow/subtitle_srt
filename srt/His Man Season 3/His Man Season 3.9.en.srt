(Hanmin: I prefer the quad room a lot better)

44
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,100

46
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,240

49
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:06,320

50
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,160

51
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,770

167
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,220
(Seungjin: Are there mission cards?)
(Minseon: No)

168
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,180
(Minseon: Are they taking us into consideration?)

169
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,060
It's not time to idle around. Wash up quickly.
(Minseon: Are they taking us into consideration?)

170
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,260
It's not time to idle around. Wash up quickly.

171

(Quad-room men who haven't checked the mission card)
It's not time to idle around. Wash up quickly.

(Quad-room men who haven't checked the mission card)

173
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,310
What am I doing?
(Quad-room men who haven't checked the mission card)

174

(Quad-room men who haven't checked the mission card)

175
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,400
(Minseon: I'm going to wash up)

176
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:35,510
(Seungjin prepares to go out after being assured by Minseon)

177
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,780
(Youngjoon: Let's go out. Have fun outside)

178
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,680
Hide it.

179
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,720
(Jaeseung: Did both of you take one?)

180
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,890
(Youngjoon: We could just not take it)

181
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,590
(Youngjoon: But even so,)

182
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,400
(Youngjoon: one of us could be chosen)

183
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,270
(Jaeseung: That's true)

184
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,730
(Youngjoon: Since you can't choose someone you've dated before)

185
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,270
(What?)

186
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,040
(Youngjoon: You can't choose someone you've dated before)

187
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,970
(Jaeseung: There's such a rule?)

188
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:02,810
You can only choose someone you've never dated.

189
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,880
(Panicking)
You can only choose someone you've never dated.

190
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,850
(Jaeseung: Wait. This is a problem then)

191
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,150
Wait.

192
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,730
(Jaeseung didn't read the mission card)
Wait.

193
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:09,860
(Jaeseung didn't read the mission card)

194
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,190
-Should we put it back? -This is a problem.
(Jaeseung didn't read the mission card)

195
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:12,650
(Jaeseung didn't read the mission card)

196
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,520
Wait. We need to think about it.

197
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,630
(Reading the mission card carefully)
Wait. We need to think about it.

198
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,920
(Reading the mission card carefully)

199
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,710
Date invitations can't be rejected.
(Reading the mission card carefully)

200
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,320
Wait.
(Reading the mission card carefully)

201
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,100
(Jaeseung: Even if I have a card,)

202
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,160
(Jaeseung: I realized I can't invite Seongmin on a date)

203
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:26,900
Wait.

204
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:26,990
(Youngjoon: Jaeseung, you can't choose any of them. You had dates with both of them)
Wait.

205
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,370
(Youngjoon: Jaeseung, you can't choose any of them. You had dates with both of them)

206
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,700
(Youngjoon: Want to hang out with me?)

207
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,510
(Jaeseung: Forget it. I don't want it then)

208
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,910
(Jaeseung: I put back the card immediately)

209
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,080
(Jaeseung: Because that card's meaningless to me)

210
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,020
(Hanmin: So funny)

211
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,950
(Youngjoon: Jaeseung, anyway,)

212
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,960
(Youngjoon: even if (Seongmin or Hwi) gets a card, they can't invite you)

213
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,860
(Youngjoon: In that case, why don't you pick someone to hang out with?)

214
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,260
(Youngjoon: Or why don't you go out with me?)

215
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,480
Let's battle today.

216
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,330
Gag battle today?

217
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,400
(Jaeseung becomes conflicted)
Gag battle today?

218
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,480
(Jaeseung becomes conflicted)

219
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,490
You get it now, right?
(Jaeseung becomes conflicted)

220
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,440
(Jaeseung becomes conflicted)

221
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,210
(Youngjoon: Think of who you've not had a date with)

222
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,410
(Youngjoon: Even if you don't choose someone, someone could choose you)

223
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,980
(Youngjoon: Or you can decide who to choose)

224
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:23,290
(Youngjoon: The best case scenario is to stay with the one you like)

225
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,720
(What is it?)

226
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,160
(Youngjoon: Not something good)

227
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,700
(Jaeseung: Whoever doesn't get chosen)

228
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,040
(Jaeseung: will have to stay at Men's House)

229
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,540
(Jaeseung: If I don't strategize,)

230
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,240
(Jaeseung: Hwi & Seongmin could naturally be left at home)

231
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,750
(Hwi takes the last card)

232
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,560
(Hwi: Ah! I was lucky!)

233
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,460
(Hwi: I finally have a chance to choose)

234
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,960
(Hwi: I was so excited)

235
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:07,900
(Jaeseung leaves because he's perplexed)

236
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,940
(Hwi: Wow, I got one today)

237
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,670
(Youngjoon: You got one, but you can't date (Seongmin))
(Hwi: Why?)

238
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,580
(Youngjoon: You can only choose someone you've never dated)

239
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,940
(Hwi: Then I'll date someone else)

240
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,910
(Hwi: Do you know who took cards?)

241
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,880
(Hwi: Who got heart cards?)

242
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,850
(Youngjoon: There are no heart cards. Only three arrow cards)

243
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,780
(Youngjoon: A one-sided invitation to the person you want)

244
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,280
(Hwi: Who took cards?)

245
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:25,670
(Hanmin, Youngjoon, and Hwi picked cards today)

246
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,360
The three of us.
(Hanmin, Youngjoon, and Hwi picked cards today)

247
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,590
(Hanmin, Youngjoon, and Hwi picked cards today)

248
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,690
(Youngjoon: (Jaeseung) put back his card, and you took it)

249
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,690
(Hwi: Jaeseung? Why?)
(Youngjoon: Because you can't date someone you've dated)

250
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,600
(Hwi: Jaeseung? But he's yet to date (Seongmin))

251
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,000
(Hwi: Oh, the night date?)

252
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,440
(Youngjoon: It's still a date, so that's that)

253
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,540
(Hwi: Have you two decided?)

254
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,240
(Youngjoon: No)
(Hanmin: No)

255
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:51,940
No, we were like this.

256
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,820
(Today's mission is a tough one for everyone)
No, we were like this.

257
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,910
(Today's mission is a tough one for everyone)

258
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,650
Should we put it back? But wait.
(Today's mission is a tough one for everyone)

259

(Youngjoon: Even if I (purposely) try to avoid choosing a date,)
Should we put it back? But wait.
(Today's mission is a tough one for everyone)

260
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,990
(Youngjoon: Even if I (purposely) try to avoid choosing a date,)

261
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,620
(Youngjoon: I can't reject whoever chooses me)

262
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,060
(Hwi: Ah, wait)

263
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:13,800
(Who will be the three couples to go on first dates?)

264
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,500
(Hwi: Did you see this? The cards?)
(Seongmin: No)

265
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,140
(Hwi: It's about first dates...)

266
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:27,280
(Hwi: You've to date someone you haven't dated before)
(Seongmin: Really?)

267
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,110
(Hwi: Whom should I go with?)

268
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,720
(Hwi: Gosh, I was happy to get this card)

269
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,690
(Seongmin: Did you get an arrow card?)
(Hwi: Yes)

270
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:38,120
(Seongmin: Go on a first date today)
(Hwi: Oh! Then...)

271
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,390
(Hwi: Whom should I go with?)
(Seongmin: With someone else)

272
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,240
(Seongmin: Wait. Should I get one too?)
(Hwi: There's none left)

273
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,750
None?
(Seongmin: Wait. Should I get one too?)
(Hwi: There's none left)

274
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,400
Oh. That's all.

275
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,640
(Who will be having first dates together?)

276
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,310
(Sigh)

277
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,880
(Seongmin: But I wanted to (date) Jaeseung today)

278
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,380
(Seongmin: I was upset)

279

(Seongmin: I wanted to (date) Jaeseung)

280
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,520
(Seongmin: I can't do that today)

281
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,290
(Seongmin: I was a bit disappointed)

282
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,670
(Hwi: I brought a gift)
(You scared me)

283
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,770
(Hwi: I brought a gift. I got a card)

284
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:29,370
(Hwi: But I have to go with someone I've never dated before)

285
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,990
(Seungjin: Shall we go out together?)

286
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:31,110
Sure.
(Seungjin: Shall we go out together?)

287
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,120
Sure.

288
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,980
(Seungjin: But I didn't get a card)

289
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,010
(Hwi: There are only three cards)

290
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,880
(Seungjin: Really?)
(Hwi: Only three cards)

291
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,750
(Hwi: When it said it has to be a first date,)

292
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,990
(Hwi: Seungjin was who I thought of)

293
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,790
(Hwi: I'm at ease around him)

294
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:50,130
(Hwi: He's someone who can give me energy)

295
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,830
(Hwi: I want to get closer to him. So I invited him on a date)

296
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,040
(Myeongkyun: When I woke up, everyone was talking to each other)

297
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,570
(Myeongkyun: about the mission)

298
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,240
(Myeongkyun: Someone must have given a card to Seungjin)

299
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,240
(Did I get everything wrong? Gosh)

300
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,810
(Jaeseung: Guys, I have a good idea)

301
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,750
(Jaeseung: Don't choose me)

302
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,320
(Youngjoon: Do you want to stay?)
(Jaeseung: Yes)

303
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,760
(Jaeseung: Hwi can't choose Seongmin anyway)

304
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,600
(Jaeseung: I don't think I'm cunning)

305
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,830
(Jaeseung: There's nothing off limits now)

306
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:32,600
(Jaeseung: If Seongmin's going to date someone again,)

307
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,340
(Jaeseung: it can't be Hwi)

308
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:41,250
(Jaeseung: It has to be me)

309
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,120
(Conflicted)
(Youngjoon: We have to decide quickly)

310
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,220
(Youngjoon: We might end up in weird pairs)

311
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:46,420
It depends on Hwi's choice.

312
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,230
(Three men who still don't know Hwi has invited Seungjin on the date)
It depends on Hwi's choice.

313
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:47,370
(Three men who still don't know Hwi has invited Seungjin on the date)

314
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,970
Right He took the last card.

(Three men who still don't know Hwi has invited Seungjin on the date)

316
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,420
Hwi might choose you.
(Three men who still don't know Hwi has invited Seungjin on the date)

317
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,290
(Jaeseung: No, I had a date (with Hwi))

318
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,990
(Jaeseung: A date at home is still a date, right?)

319
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,290
(Youngjoon: That's not a date)
(Jaeseung: Isn't it a home date?)

320
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,760
(Youngjoon: No. It said only six people went on dates then)

321
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,970
(Youngjoon: That's not a date)

322
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,530
(Jaeseung: Hwi would think that home date was a date too)

323
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:03,700
Hwi.

324
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,230
(Joking)
Hwi.

325
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,359
(Joking)

326
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,339
Hey, stop there.
(Joking)

327
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,530
No, but he's not...

328
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,790
(Jaeseung: To have a date now with me is too much...)

329
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,480
-for him too. -Yes.
(Jaeseung: To have a date now with me is too much...)

330
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:13,589
(Jaeseung: It'll be uncomfortable for him)
-for him too. -Yes.
(Jaeseung: To have a date now with me is too much...)

331
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,579
(Jaeseung: It'll be uncomfortable for him)

332
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,650
(Youngjoon: You never know. He could be mentally prepared)

333
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,819
(Jaeseung: Mentally prepared?)

334
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,420
(Minseon: Only three couples can (date)?)

335
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,319
(Minseon: I'll be at home today)

336
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:27,290
(Minseon: Should I swim at home? Instead of going out)

337
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,430
(Seungjin: Only three couples can date?)

338
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,500
(Minseon: Yes. Three couples who haven't dated before)

339
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,000
(Minseon: Should I stay home?)

340
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,040
(Minseon: If I can stay at home, I'll be happy)

341
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:37,400
One pair's always left out.

342
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,410
(Feeling sorry)
One pair's always left out.

343
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,240
(Minseon: Go have fun with Hwi)

344
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,680
(Seungjin: I feel bad)

345
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,710
(Minseon: I think Myeongkyun and I will be left)

346
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:52,180
(Seungjin: I can leave home only because Hwi chose me)

347
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,620
(Seungjin: If not, do you think I can leave the house today?)

348
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,120
(Minseon: What? Hwi chose you?)
(Seungjin: Yes)

349
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,490
(Oh, really?)

350
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,530
(Minseon: I was just guessing)

351
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,960
(Minseon: when I said you and Hwi should go on a date. So it's true)

352
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,800
(Minseon: Then Myeongkyun and I'd be alone at home)

353
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:10,570
(It might be a good thing)

354
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:10,820
(The three are still having a strategy meeting(?))

355
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,970
Choose me or Seongmin.
(The three are still having a strategy meeting(?))

356
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:13,120
(Youngjoon: Do you want to choose someone other than your roommate?)
Choose me or Seongmin.
(The three are still having a strategy meeting(?))

357
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,140
(Youngjoon: Do you want to choose someone other than your roommate?)

358
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,640
(Youngjoon: Or choose your roommate?)
(Hanmin: What should I do?)

359
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,010
(Youngjoon: I'm fine with both)

360
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,480
(Hanmin: Then I'll choose Seongmin)

361
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,250
(Hanmin: Like a roommate date)

362
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,950
(Hanmin: Because I want to talk to Seongmin more)

363
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,920
(Hanmin: I thought it'd be nice to go on a date together)

364
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,590
Let's hang out.

365
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,050
(After a long meet, Youngjoon & Jaeseung decides to go on a date)
Let's hang out.

366
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:34,910
-Okay. -Okay?
(After a long meet, Youngjoon & Jaeseung decides to go on a date)

367
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:35,040
(After a long meet, Youngjoon & Jaeseung decides to go on a date)

368
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,060
Sure.
(After a long meet, Youngjoon & Jaeseung decides to go on a date)

369
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,600
(Jaeseung: It's a pity that I can't date (Seongmin))

370
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,870
(Jaeseung: But I'm still satisfied)

371
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,410
(Hanmin: Let's go on a roommate date)

372
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,140
(Seongmin: What's this? All of a sudden)

373
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,540
(Hanmin: Let's go on a roommate date)

374
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,450
(Seongmin: Okay. Thank you)

375
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,250
(Seongmin: I thought I'd be alone today)

376
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,450
(Seongmin: It's a pity that I can't hang out with Jaeseung. But...)

377
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,420
Hanmin asked me out.

378
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:01,580
(Seongmin: I can go on a date)
Hanmin asked me out.

379
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,290
(Seongmin: I can go on a date)

380
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,890
(Seongmin: I'm relieved)

381
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,360
(Youngjoon: Good for you)
(Why?)

382
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,440
(Minseon: Did something good happen to me?)
(Youngjoon: Yes)

383
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,030
Why?
(Minseon: Did something good happen to me?)
(Youngjoon: Yes)

384
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,170
(Youngjoon: You don't have to go on a date)
(Minseon: Is that a good thing?)
Why?
(Minseon: Did something good happen to me?)
(Youngjoon: Yes)

385
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,870
(Youngjoon: You don't have to go on a date)
(Minseon: Is that a good thing?)

386
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:23,110
(Youngjoon: You two won't go on a date)
(Minseon: Me and Myeongkyun? I know that)

387
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,080
(Youngjoon: Did you hear about it?)

388
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,850
(Minseon: When I went to the first floor, there was nothing)

389
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,110
(Minseon: Everyone said they got a card. I was just done washing up)

390
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,450
(Youngjoon: Only you two got what you want)

391
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,750
(Jaeseung: I thought we could go on a date today)

392
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,520
(Jaeseung: It's really not easy)

393
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,360
(Seongmin: Are you going out with Youngjoon today?)

394
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:38,690
Yes.
(Seongmin: Are you going out with Youngjoon today?)

395
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:38,980
(Seongmin: Do you think it'll be fun to hang out with Youngjoon?)
Yes.
(Seongmin: Are you going out with Youngjoon today?)

396
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,660
(Seongmin: Do you think it'll be fun to hang out with Youngjoon?)

397
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,200
(Jaeseung: It should be fun)

398
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,570
(Jaeseung: We're similar in some aspects)

399
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,230
(Jaeseung: Though we're different too)

400
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,340
(Seongmin: But you don't get along with "NF" types (MBTI))

401
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,370
(Seongmin: Why are you similar with Youngjoon?)

402
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,880
(Jaeseung: With (Youngjoon), it's not about)

403
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,770
(Jaeseung: having similar personalities, but that we have a good rapport)

404
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,130
That's why.
(Jaeseung: having similar personalities, but that we have a good rapport)

405
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,820
(Seongmin: I was concerned about Jaeseung's date (with Youngjoon))

406
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,260
(Seongmin: I hope nothing happens)

407
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:10,460
We mixed what was left together.

408
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,020
(Men in the quad room are busy preparing for their dates)
We mixed what was left together.

409
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,350
(Men in the quad room are busy preparing for their dates)

410
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,810
It just smelled stronger.
(Men in the quad room are busy preparing for their dates)

411
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:14,820
(Men in the quad room are busy preparing for their dates)

412
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,260
It's mixed.
(Men in the quad room are busy preparing for their dates)

413
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,370
(Men in the quad room are busy preparing for their dates)

414
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,350
I wonder what it tastes like.
(Men in the quad room are busy preparing for their dates)

415
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,670
(Myeongkyun: What are you talking about?) (Taking a glance)

416
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,720
What was it?
(Myeongkyun: What are you talking about?) (Taking a glance)

417
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:22,630
The coffee beans downstairs...

418
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,630
(Youngjoon becomes quiet as soon as Myeongkyun shows up)
The coffee beans downstairs...

(Youngjoon becomes quiet as soon as Myeongkyun shows up)

420
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,440
The remaining coffee beans are decaffeinated.
(Youngjoon becomes quiet as soon as Myeongkyun shows up)

421
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,370
(Youngjoon: I decided to ignore (Myeongkyun))

422
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,080
(Youngjoon: To treat him like he's invisible)

423
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,910
(Youngjoon: so I'm not affected by him)

424
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,650
(The air between the two is still cold)

425
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:43,920
(Seungjin deep in thought alone in the kitchen)

426
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:50,030
(Seungjin: I'm happy to go on a date with Hwi)

427
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,070
(Seungjin: But I don't think Hwi wants to go on a date)

428
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,100
(Seungjin: with me)

429
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:03,940
(Seungjin: Because I can guess who he wants to go out with)

430
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,380
(Seungjin: It's a bit... frustrating)

431
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,650
(Hwi: Oh?)

432
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,420
(Hwi: Why are you eating alone?)

433
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,090
(Seungjin: Me?)

434
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,320
(Seungjin: Where have you been?)

435
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,020
Hwi: I want breakfast too)

436
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,590
(Hwi: What should I eat?)

437
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,730
(Seungjin: Cereal?)

438
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,760
(Hwi: Cereal? I'll eat this. Carbonated water)

439
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,100
((In disbelief) Seungjin: Is that breakfast?)

440
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,500
(Hwi: It'll be fun today)

441
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,140
(Seungjin: Is this really your breakfast?)
(Hwi: What's wrong?)

442
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,870
(Seungjin: You shouldn't have said it was breakfast)

443
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,510
(Carbonated water & ice cream)
(Hwi & Seungjin's simple breakfast)

444
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,210
(Seungjin: What should we do today?)

445
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,680
(Hwi: It must be fun)

446
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,380
(Hwi: Let’s go space out)

447
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,420
(Seungjin: Wow, I said this yesterday)

448
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,820
(Hwi: Oh, really?)

449
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,450
(Seungjin: I said I wanted to space out)

450
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,390
(Hwi: At a quiet place)
(Seungjin: Yeah, haha)

451
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,090
(Hwi: Go space out and take a few photos)

452
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:57,400
(Seungjin: It's the same as what I said)

453
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:01,600
(Seungjin: Go see some scenery or some place)

454
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,400
(Seungjin: Or like Han River)

455
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,800
(Hwi: Wow, Han River sounds nice)

456
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:11,210
(Seungjin: I just want to space out for a while there and come back)

457
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:14,710
(Hwi: I want to space out today too)

458
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,950
(What kind of therapeutic date will the two have?)

459
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,170
(Myeongkyun & Minseon, who will stay at Men's House, are preparing slowly)

460
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,430
For today...

463
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,730
(Minseon: You need to use hairspray, so I'll go up there)

464
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,490
(Minseon: I'll just make their beds for them)

465
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,700
(Myeongkyun: Looks like they were in a hurry)

466
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,960
(Myeongkyun: Everyone must have gone out)

467
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,630
(Minseon: No, not yet)

468
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,530
(Myeongkyun: But it's 11 a.m.?)

469

(Myeongkyun: It's nice not to have to hurry)

470
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:43,480
(The newbie should be doing such stuff)

471
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:50,120
(The former young one still helps make their beds)

(Myeongkyun: I hardly met (Youngjoon) in the morning)

476

(Men gathered on the first-floor double room)

478

00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:13,290
(Jaeseung: I was just curious and unsure...)
(Youngjoon: You're not sure if you like me)

790
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,290
(Jaeseung: I was unsure and just curious)

791
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:20,830
(Jaeseung: Back then, it wasn't that clear)

792
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:24,340
(Jaeseung: who we really like yet)

793
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,270
(Youngjoon: I was a little surprised but happy too)

794
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,670
(Youngjoon: Because he was also one of the men)

795
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,440
(Youngjoon: I wanted to make a phone call to)

796
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,120
(Youngjoon: (Jaeseung) was in my top 2)

797
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:43,420
(Youngjoon: During the first call session)

798
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:48,330
(Youngjoon: and the second day's date,)

799
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:52,460
(Youngjoon: I was choosing between you and Seongmin)

800
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,200
(Youngjoon: After consideration, I called Seongmin on the first day)

801
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,810
(Youngjoon: (On the second day), I met Hanmin)

802
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,010
(Youngjoon: When I was thinking about it,)

803
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,280
(Youngjoon: Myeongkyun also joined)

804
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,310
(Youngjoon: I had too busy)

805
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:09,210
(Youngjoon: I had a lot to think about)

806
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:13,750
(Youngjoon: I didn't have a chance to listen to you)

807
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:15,490
(Youngjoon: I couldn't figure out who liked whom)

808
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:20,790
(Youngjoon: But that night, I found out Hwi was having a tough time)

809
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:26,160
(Youngjoon: That's when I found out about the love triangle)

810
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:33,340
(He carefully brings up the love triangle of Jaeseung, Seongmin, and Hwi)

811
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:39,140
(Jaeseung: Actually, I left Seongmin's anonymous chat)

812
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,210
(Youngjoon: After entering it?)
(Jaeseung: Yes)

813
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:46,020
(Jaeseung: Unlike me, Hwi's very forward)

814
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,120
(Jaeseung: What he said...)

815
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,890
(Jaeseung: I was looking at the conversation. He didn't do anything wrong)

816
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,730
(Jaeseung: But I got angry)

817
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,830
(Jaeseung: Hwi does what I can't do with ease)

818
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:58,760
(Jaeseung: He does it well)
(Youngjoon: He does it with ease)

819
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,900
(Jaeseung: I thought about this too)

820
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,700
(Jaeseung: (Other men's) progress are moving fast)

821
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,370
(Jaeseung: But I feel like I can't catch up with them)

822
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:12,110
(Jaeseung: When I come to my senses,)

823
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:15,250
(Jaeseung: people were mutually interested)

824
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,980
(Jaeseung: and already developing romances)

825
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:24,260
(Jaeseung: Actually, I wasn't obsessively interested in Seongmin)

826
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:29,260
(Jaeseung: or whatnot from the beginning)

827
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,130
(Jaeseung: I just wanted to spend time with him)

828
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:32,670
(Jaeseung: I just wanted to know more about Seongmin)

829
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,830
He's the first person you met too.
(Jaeseung: I just wanted to know more about Seongmin)

830
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:35,830
(Jaeseung: I just wanted to know more about Seongmin)

831
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:40,640
(Jaeseung: That's what I thought. But from some point,)

832
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,240
(Jaeseung: Hwi and Seongmin have already become close)

833
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,140
(Youngjoon: And (Hwi & Seongmin) are roommates and always together)

834
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,780
(Youngjoon: I didn't think there was anything between them,)

835
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,820
(Youngjoon: but I always joked about if they were married,)

836
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,320
(Youngjoon: since they're always together)

837
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,690
(Jaeseung: Now it's really complicated)

838
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:01,660
(Jaeseung: I think Hwi and my dynamic will stay this way)

839
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,200
(Jaeseung carefully speaks his mind)

840
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:13,170
(Jaeseung: But...)

841
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:16,640
(Jaeseung: I've been uncomfortable with Hwi)

842
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,840
(Youngjoon: It can't be helped)

843
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:24,120
(Jaeseung: It can't be helped...)
(Youngjoon: Isn't it likely that it'll stay this way till the end?)

844
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:30,720
(Jaeseung: What will be waiting for us in the house? I'm worried)

845
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,920
(Youngjoon: Tonight?)

846
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,930
(Jaeseung: Everyone's in a good mood during the daytime dates)
(Youngjoon: And disasters at night)

847
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:38,400
(Jaeseung: Disasters at night)

848
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,730
(Youngjoon: Everyone's separated and crying)

849
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,500
(Jaeseung: I almost cried yesterday)

850
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,740
(Youngjoon: People were crying here and there)

851
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,340
(Jaeseung: This fight will only end when)

852
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,650
(Jaeseung: someone gives up)

853
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,050
(Jaeseung: But...)

854
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:58,920
(I doubt either of us would give up)

855
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,620
(Youngjoon: Actually, I overheard,)

856
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,290
(Youngjoon: while washing dishes yesterday night,)

857
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,630
(Youngjoon: Seongmin telling Hwi)

858
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,930
(Youngjoon: that if he could choose his date tomorrow,)

859
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:12,300
(Youngjoon: he'd choose Jaeseung)

860
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,730
(Youngjoon: That he's went on a proper date with Hwi,)

861
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,800
(Youngjoon: but he's never had a proper date with Jaeseung)

862
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,410
(Youngjoon: He wants to decide after that)

863
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:24,710
(Youngjoon: That's what he said)

864
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,540
(Youngjoon: I was)

865
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,080
(Youngjoon: surprised by how direct)

866
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:33,490
(Youngjoon: Seongmin was towards Hwi)

867
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:38,560
(Youngjoon: I understood it but also felt sorry for Hwi)

868
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,430
(Jaeseung: It was the first time I heard about it)

869
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:45,800
(Jaeseung: It made me really happy. I felt a little relieved)

870
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,840
(Jaeseung: Right now...)

871
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:54,110
(Jaeseung: it's a situation where no one can be just optimistic)

872
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:58,480
(Jaeseung: The third day and the fourth day)

873
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,380
(Jaeseung: had been like a roller coaster)

874
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,120
(Jaeseung: I plunge endlessly (into sadness)...)

875
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,020
(Youngjoon: Then feel better)

876
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,790
(Youngjoon: Polar opposite feelings)

877
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,990
(Youngjoon: It was a roller coaster for me too during the anonymous chat)

878
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:15,090
(Youngjoon: Then I talked to Myeongkyun)

879
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:17,700
(Youngjoon: Before that, I talked to Hanmin)

880
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,470
(Up & down)
(Youngjoon: It was nonstop...)

881
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:25,870
(Jaeseung: I know you don't have a good relationship with Myeongkyun)

882
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:31,140
(Jaeseung: Actually, most people... Now, everyone knows it)

883
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,910
(Jaeseung: I hope you remember)

884
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,250
(Jaeseung: who's by your side)

885
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:41,690
(Jaeseung: To your crush, how will your words and actions...)
(Youngjoon: How will they reflect upon me?)

886
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,820
(Jaeseung: You can't know what Hanmin thinks)

887
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,530
(Jaeseung: He might be disappointed)
(Youngjoon: Yes...)

888
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:50,030
(Jaeseung: I hope you be more discreet)

889
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,560
(Jaeseung: Be more discreet)

890
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,370
(Youngjoon: I'm getting angrier because of that too)

891
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:00,910
(Youngjoon: I keep getting affected by (Myeongkyun) and)

892
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,240
(Youngjoon: showing my bad side to Hanmin)

893
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,840
(Jaeseung: I know)
(Youngjoon: It mades me angrier)

894
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,380
(Youngjoon: Because of that, I show my bad side)

895
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,380
(Youngjoon: to Hanmin again)

896
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,480
(Youngjoon: It's a vicious cycle)

897
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,320
(Youngjoon: I couldn't handle it yesterday)

898
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,290
(Jaeseung: I don't know the details about)

899
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:19,690
(Jaeseung: what happened between you and Myeongkyun)

900
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:23,700
(Jaeseung: So I'll stay neutral)

901
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,260
(Jaeseung: I won't take sides)

902
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,870
(Jaeseung: Both you and Myeongkyun are responsible for)

903
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:32,270
(Jaeseung: making others walk on eggshells around you two)

904
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:35,740
(Jaeseung: because of your relationship)

905
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,130
That's what I think.

906
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:43,920
(Youngjoon: Even if I have to wait,)

907
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,650
(Youngjoon: I'm going to end this (with Myeongkyun) today)

908
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,220
(Jaeseung: Anyway, you've problems to solve)

909
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,760
(Jaeseung: I also have problems to solve)

910
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,360
(Sigh...)

911
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,600
(Youngjoon: We had a heart-to-heart conversation)

912
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,040
(Youngjoon: I understood Jaeseung better)

913
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,740
(Youngjoon: We exchanged our thoughts sincerely)

914
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:11,410
(Youngjoon: That's always nice)

915
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:14,550
(Jaeseung: Youngjoon's a thoughtful person)

916
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:19,480
(Jaeseung: That's why I saw a new side of him)

917
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,450
(Jaeseung: Thanks to Youngjoon, in the amusement park,)

918
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:26,690
(Jaeseung: I got rejuvenated. I had a good time)

919
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:35,470
(Jaeseung & Youngjoon's first date
where they shared their innermost feelings and troubles)

920
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,710
(Seongmin: What is this place?)
(Hanmin: Yeah, what is this place?)

921
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,380
(Seongmin: I’m so curious)

922
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,350
(Hanmin: The weather is great too)

923
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,220
(Seongmin: I'm looking forward to it. What could it be?)

924
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,290
(Seongmin: It's an exhibition hall)

925
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:00,830
(Seongmin: Wow. I really wanted to come)
(Hanmin: Me too)

926
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:03,450
(Full of sculptures and paintings)
(Emotional gallery filled with installation art)

927
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:04,380
Do you like them?
(Full of sculptures and paintings)
(Emotional gallery filled with installation art)

928
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,800
Yes, I often go to exhibitions.
(Full of sculptures and paintings)
(Emotional gallery filled with installation art)

929
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:06,960
(Full of sculptures and paintings)
(Emotional gallery filled with installation art)

930
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,320
Really? That's a relief.
(Full of sculptures and paintings)
(Emotional gallery filled with installation art)

931
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,120
It must be fun.
(Full of sculptures and paintings)
(Emotional gallery filled with installation art)

932
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:09,190
(Full of sculptures and paintings)
(Emotional gallery filled with installation art)

933
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,980
Yeah, totally.
(Full of sculptures and paintings)
(Emotional gallery filled with installation art)

934
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:11,470
(Full of sculptures and paintings)
(Emotional gallery filled with installation art)

935
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,590
(What kind of first date will Hanmin & Seongmin have here?)

936
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:16,510
-Wow. -Wow.
(What kind of first date will Hanmin & Seongmin have here?)

937
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,330
-Wow. -Wow.

938
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:21,580
(Seongmin: The building here is very stylish. The passage too)

939
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:24,320
(Hanmin: Doesn't it look like a maze?)

940
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,120
(Seongmin: So cool)

941
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,120
(Seongmin: How did they build this?)

942
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,790
(Seongmin: I'm so excited, right?)
(Hanmin: Super)

943
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:36,430
(Seongmin: What kind of painting is this? It's a photo)

944
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:39,400
(Hanmin: It looks like a ball... or a rock?)

945
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,370
(Seongmin: I wanted to go to exhibition halls and art museums)

946
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:45,240
(Seongmin: I was really happy to have went to one)

947
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,980
(Hanmin: Actually, I prefer sporty activities)

948
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:55,750
(Hanmin: It's an exhibition so Seongmin was very happy.)

949
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:03,690
(-Seongmin: But it's really detailed. -Hanmin: Yeah, with the trees and everything.)

950
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:09,190
(-Seongmin: But this house is actually made of wood. -Hanmin: Yeah, it looks like a studio.)

951
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:15,170
(-Seongmin: I've always liked this kind of countryside atmosphere with the nature. -Hanmin: Yeah...)

952
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,440
(Seongmin: Don't you want to know the meaning behind this?)

953
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:19,500
(Seongmin: Like what the photographer's purpose was?)

954
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,870
Like what the photographer's purpose was?
(Seongmin: Like what the photographer's purpose was?)

955
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:24,540
(Seongmin: What is he trying to deliver...)

956
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:25,620
(-Hanmin: I actually don't really like countrysides like this. -Seongmin: Oh, really?)

957
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:28,550
-I actually don't really like countrysides like this. -Oh, really?
(-Hanmin: I actually don't really like countrysides like this. -Seongmin: Oh, really?)

958
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:31,150
(Panicked Seongmin: You and I are different... quite different...)

959
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:33,320
(Hanmin: Because my hometown is in the country... countryside.)

960
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,190
(Seongmin: Oh? Where are you from?)

961
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:37,190
(-Hanmin: I'm from Gangwon Province. -Seongmin: Oh, right, right.)

962
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:40,130
(Seongmin: Then this could be work depicting your hometown, right?)

963
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:44,560
(Hanmin: No, my hometown doesn't freeze like that.)

964
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,070
(Hanmin: Am I too much like a T?)

965
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:51,300
(Seongmin: I think it's fun to figure out an artist's purpose.)

966
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,610
(Seongmin: But Hanmin said when it comes to figuring out a work's purpose,)

967
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:59,440
(Seongmin: he isn't interested. So this part we are very different...)

968
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:04,640
(Seongmin: Yeah... just... just a little bit...)

969
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:04,650
But being different is also a charm.
(Seongmin: Yeah... just... just a little bit...)

970
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:08,190
(Positive Seongmin: But being different is also a charm.)
But being different is also a charm.

971
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:08,590
Honestly, I've never stayed for more than an hour before.

972
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:12,420
(Hanmin: Honestly, I've never stayed for more than an hour before.)
Honestly, I've never stayed for more than an hour before.

973
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,360
(Hanmin: If there are pictures I want to take, I take it.)

974
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,230
(Hanmin: I look through the works quickly,)

975
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:20,430
(Hanmin: and then leave to go look at other interesting things.)

976
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:20,570
(Hanmin: An art gallery is just a place to stay for a bit.)

977
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:24,220
An art gallery is just a place to stay for a bit.
(Hanmin: An art gallery is just a place to stay for a bit.)

978
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:26,720
("It's too profound...")

979
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,570
It really is profound.
("It's too profound...")

980
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:29,140
("It's too profound...")

981
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:29,900
(The two head to the next exhibition hall)

982
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,020
Wow, great!
(The two head to the next exhibition hall)

983
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:31,030

Wow, it's seriously great!

(The two head to the next exhibition hall)

986
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,090
It’s really beautiful.
(The two head to the next exhibition hall)

987
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:40,660
(Hanmin: That road we saw just now is kind of like the one in the photo...)

988
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:40,750
Yeah, a little... I think it's connected.
(Hanmin: That road we saw just now is kind of like the one in the photo...)

989
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:43,200
(*Bumps* Seongmin: Yeah, a little... I think it's connected.)
Yeah, a little... I think it's connected.

991
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:44,760
-I'm sorry. -I'm sorry.
(*Bumps* Seongmin: Yeah, a little... I think it's connected.)

992
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:47,530
(Seongmin: This road is so beautiful.)

993
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:51,010
(Two people in a painting-like passage)

994
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:53,430
Is this the place? Let's go in.
(Two people in a painting-like passage)

995
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:54,430

998
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,600
(-Is this a love house? -It's a love house.)

999
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:00,540
-It's nice. -Yeah.

1000

1003
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,980
(-Hanmin: Be careful here. -Seongmin: Thank you.)

1004
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,920
(-Seongmin: This is great! Don't you think it smells like wood? -Hanmin: It does.)

1005
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:15,120
(-Seongmin: This is Korean, right? -Hanmin: Yeah.)

1006
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,160
(-Seongmin: How did they make this? -Hanmin: I know right?)

1007
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,520
(-Seongmin: Are these knives? -Hanmin: Nails!)

1008
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,960
(-Seongmin: Oh, they're nails. -Hanmin: Yeah.)

1009
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:24,630
(-Hanmin: I'll take a picture of you here. -Seongmin: Sure, take one for me.)

1010
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,170
(Seongmin: Are you good at taking photos?)

1011
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:29,630
(Shy)

1012
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:29,670
-How should I pose. I'm so awkard. -Don't come too close.
(Shy)

1013

(Seongmin: I'm holding my bag with two hands, is that okay?)

1018
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,350
(Hanmin: Suit yourself. Or just hold it with one hand.)

1019
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:40,580
(-Move a bit to the side. -Like this?)

(Hanmin takes a good photo of Seongming)

1026
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,200
It came out well!
(Hanmin takes a good photo of Seongming)

1027
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:55,130
(Seongmin: I'll take one for you, too.)

1028
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:59,060
(Seongmin: From the front I kind of look like a doctor?)

1029
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,670
(It's finally Hanmin's favorite photo time)

1030
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,840
(Seongmin: Wow... model's really are different.)

1031
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:11,180
So handsome.

(Click)
So handsome.

1033
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,680
(Seongmin: But your face is seriously so small.)

1034
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,850
(Seongmin: Hanmin was wearing a boyfriend look so he looked like a boyfriend.)

1035
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:23,390
(Seongmin: So it felt like a date?)

1036
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:27,460
(Hanmin: It was fun at the time and I got excited.)

1037
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,430
(Hanmin: I got excited)

1038
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:32,460
(Hanmin: and would be down again after seeing the photos)

1039
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,630

You know how this is the national rule, right?
(V V V)

00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,870
(*V V V* Hanmin: You know how this is the national rule, right?)
You know how this is the national rule, right?

1043
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:42,940
(Hanmin: Going on a field trip to places like this.)

1044
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:46,240
(It's cute)

1045
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:47,040
(-Seongmin: Iced americano. I want an iced americano. -Hanmin: Do you want to go to a cafe?)

- I want an iced americano. -Do you want to go to a cafe?
(-Seongmin: Iced americano. I want an iced americano. -Hanmin: Do you want to go to a cafe?)

1050
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:03,360
(Finally!)

1051
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:06,300
(Seongmin: How was today's exhibition?)

1052
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,100

1053
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:13,010
(-Hanmin: But it's been a while since I last saw an exhibition. -Seongmin: Yeah.)

1054
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:13,170
It... was nice.
(-Hanmin: But it's been a while since I last saw an exhibition. -Seongmin: Yeah.)

1055
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:17,840
(Hesitating Hanmin: It... was nice.)
It... was nice.

1056
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,480
(Hanmin: I felt sorry towards Seongmin.)

1057
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:27,350
(Hanmin: I wanted to look more excited but it felt too forced... yeah.)

1058
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:30,590
(Seongmin: You like extreme sports, right?)

1059
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:36,960
(Hanmin: Yeah, I usually like to workout.)

1060
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,470
(-Hanmin: So I usually like to do some light exercises with my other half. -Seongmin: Ah...)

1061
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:44,440
(Seongmin: You're talking about going to the gym, right?)

1062
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,840
(Hanmin: Yeah, whether it's going to the gym or going rock climbing,)

1063
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,080
(Hanmin: it's nice to be disciplined together.)

1064
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:55,580
(Hanmin: It can also improve the relationship.)

1065
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,780
(Seongmin: We should be disciplined, too.)

1066
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,750
(Hanmin: Yeah, being disciplined is a must.)

1067
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:04,760
(Seongmin: For Hanmin, I don't think he really enjoyed the exhibition date)

1068
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,560
(Seongmin: which I really loved.)

1069
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:13,130
(Seongmin: I really hate the outdoors and extreme sports, but he likes that kind of dates.)

1070
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:16,330
(Seongmin: You've always been friends with Jaeseung on SNS, right?)

1071
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,970
(Seongmin: Have you not met each other before?)

1072
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:20,970
(-Hanmin: Not at all. -Seongmin: No? Ah...)

1073
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:24,210
(Hanmin: We really only followed each other on Instagram)

1074
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:28,210
(Hanmin: and met each other for the first time here.)

1075
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:31,980
(Hanmin: He just looked familiar, that's all.)

1076
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,950
(-Seongmin: Ah... so you guys recognized each other. -Hanmin: Yeah.)

1077
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:34,000
(Hanmin: That's why I tried to avoid Jaeseung.)

1078
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,490
That's why I tried to avoid Jaeseung.
(Hanmin: That's why I tried to avoid Jaeseung.)

1079
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:36,550
(Seongmin: Ah... avoid him?)
That's why I tried to avoid Jaeseung.
(Hanmin: That's why I tried to avoid Jaeseung.)

1080
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:38,790
(Seongmin: Ah... avoid him?)

1081
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:38,940
(Hanmin: Because it's a bit awkward when I'm with Jaeseung.)

1082
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:41,330
Because it's a bit awkward when I'm with Jaeseung.
(Hanmin: Because it's a bit awkward when I'm with Jaeseung.)

1083
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:41,380
(Hanmin: Like, if we were strangers,)
Because it's a bit awkward when I'm with Jaeseung.
(Hanmin: Because it's a bit awkward when I'm with Jaeseung.)

1084
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:43,760
(Hanmin: Like, if we were strangers,)

1085
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,400
(Hanmin: I'd think "oh he's a stranger, it's my first time seeing him.")

1086
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,770
(Hanmin: "What should I ask?")

1087
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:52,570
(Hanmin: But we're not completely strangers.)

1088
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:55,410
(Hanmin: With Jaeseung,)

1089
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:59,380
(Hanmin: honestly if it wasn't because of Youngjoon, I think we can go on a date.)

1090
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:04,620
(Hanmin: I feel like it could also 'relieve the awkwardness.')

1091
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,650
(Hanmin: I want to go on a date with him.)

1092
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:12,760
(Hanmin: But then in the middle... at night)

1093
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,330
(Hanmin: Youngjoon left for a bit)

1094
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:19,400
(Hanmin: and that's when we talked comfortably for a bit.)

1095
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:26,510
(Hanmin: So last night we talked a lot, too.)

1096
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:31,240
(Hanmin: There's something I needed to tell Jaeseung too so...)

1097
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:31,330
(Seongmin: I'm really curious about what you guys talked about.)

1098
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:34,110
-I'm really curious about what you guys talked about. -We talked about a lot.
(Seongmin: I'm really curious about what you guys talked about.)

1099
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:36,110
(-Seongmin: Can't you tell me? -Hanmin: What?)

1100
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,680
(Seongmin: What you guys talked about.)

1101
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,020
(Hanmin: Well...)

1102
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:41,450
(-Seongmin: What's bothering you? -Hanmin: Me?)

1103
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:42,790
(Hanmin: For me...)

1104
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:47,330
(Hanmin: My relationship with Youngjoon is really...)

1105
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:49,230
(Hanmin: How should I put it...)

1106
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:55,300
(-Is it developing really quickly? -Hanmin: We promised we would go on dates "casually")

1107
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,470
(Hanmin: but then those who saw us)

1108
00:50:57,470 --> 00:50:59,340
(Hanmin: started saying that "they are a already a couple.")

1109
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:05,110
(Hanmin: Everyone is rushing things and this way of thinking in general is just...)

1110
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,850
it makes me think "is it okay to go on like this?"

1111
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:11,560
(“Is it okay to go on like this?”)
it makes me think "is it okay to go on like this?"

1112
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:11,670
(“Is it okay to go on like this?”)

1113
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:12,150
"Aren't we going too fast?" is what I'm worried about.
(“Is it okay to go on like this?”)

1114
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:17,020
(Hanmin: "Aren't we (Hanmin and Youngjoon) going too fast?" is what I'm worried about.)
"Aren't we going too fast?" is what I'm worried about.

1115
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:20,830
(Hanmin: 'Aren't we supposed to go on dates with other people)

1116
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:24,900
(Hanmin: and express our interest to other's, too?')

1117
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:25,030
was what we talked about.
(Hanmin: and express our interest to other's, too?')

1118
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:28,250
(Hanmin: This is what I talked about with Youngjoon.)
was what we talked about.

1119
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:28,730
(Hanmin: This is what I talked about with Youngjoon.)

1120
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:32,200
(Hanmin: But under the current circumstances, to be honest,)

1121
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:37,280
(Hanmin: there's not a lot of people that I'm)

1122
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,810
(Hanmin: interested in.)

1123
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:45,320
(Hanmin: so now)

1124
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:52,520
(-Hanmin: I'm just expressing it more directly to the person I'm interested in. -Seongmin: I see...)

1125
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,890
(Hanmin: Of course, in the process of getting to know each other,)

1126
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:58,060
(Hanmin: it’s best to leave a good impression.)

1127
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:04,400
(Hanmin: But if there's someone I'm interested in already, I don't see a point?)

1128
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,840
(Hanmin: It might cause me more trouble if I get to know someone else more.)

1129
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,020
(Seongmin: More trouble?)

1130
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,080
-More trouble? -Yeah.
(Seongmin: More trouble?)

1131
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:10,150
(Hanmin: The more choices there are, the more problems there will be.)
-More trouble? -Yeah.
(Seongmin: More trouble?)

1132
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:14,350
(Hanmin: The more choices there are, the more problems there will be.)

1133
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:19,050
(Hanmin: So I don't want to cause myself any trouble.)

1134
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:23,620
(Seongmin: If he doesn't want to settle with Youngjoon,)

1135
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,460
(Seongmin: and be with him,)

1136
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:28,490
(Seongmin: then he's definitely allowed to go on dates with other people.)

1137
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:31,630
(Seongmin: But then he's saying that he has no thoughts of going on dates.)

1138
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:36,330
(Seongmin: But he's also not sure if he's really into Youngjoon.)

1139
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:41,770
(Seongmin: To me, this is a bit...)

1140
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:48,350
(Seongmin: To be honest, I'm really thankful towards you.)

1141
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:54,120
(Seongmin: When I was trying to style my hair that day and suddenly started to cry,)

1142
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:54,580
(Seongmin: I was also really flustered.)

1143
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,720
I was also really flustered.
(Seongmin: I was also really flustered.)

1144
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:56,840
(Seongmin: So I used all my strength to try to stop my tears)
I was also really flustered.
(Seongmin: I was also really flustered.)

1145
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,360
(Seongmin: So I used all my strength to try to stop my tears)

1146
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,230
(Seongmin: but then you came in soon after)

1147
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:04,630
(Seongmin: and when you noticed,)

1148
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:11,640
(Seongmin: you comforted me a lot so I'm really thankful and)

1149
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:16,010
('I realized I've been misunderstanding you.')

1150
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,180
(Seongmin: At the time,)

1151
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:22,210
(Seongmin: I misunderstood and thought you were interested in Jaeseung.)

1152
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:28,420
(Seongmin: But then in the end I realized that you're good at comforting others.)

1153
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:33,660
(-Seongmin: I thought, 'you're really good at listening to others.' -Hanmin: Yeah...)

1154
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:36,830
(Hanmin: Through that short conversation with you, I also thought)

1155
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:41,230
(Hanmin: that you are calm and gentle.)

1156
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:46,570
(-Hanmin: That's why I could approach you and comfort you. -Seongmin: Really?)

1157
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:51,580
(Hanmin: If it was someone who likes to complain,)

1158
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,910
(Hanmin: if there's someone like that here,)

1159
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:58,250
(Hanmin: I don't think I would know how to take care of him.)

1160
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:01,350
(Hanmin: I think we give off a similar feeling.)

1161
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,260
(Hanmin: We are both calm.)

1162
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:08,360
(-Hanmin: I think we are similar in this way. -Seongmin: I see.)

1163
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,660
(Hanmin: Though there are eight people, I've never)

1164
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:15,730
(Hanmin: had a serious chat with anyone before.)

1165
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:21,970
(Hanmin: If it's with someone younger than me, our ways of thinking will be different)

1166
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:24,440
(Hanmin: so I tend to be very cautious.)

1167
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,910
(-Seongmin: I'm actually more comfortable around those who are younger than me. -Hanmin: Really?)

1168
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:30,120
(Seongmin: I usually date those who are younger.)

1169
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:35,450
(Seongmin: But... Hwi is seven years younger than me.)

1170
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,120
(Seongmin: But then with Jaeseung, I feel comfortable.)

1171
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,090
(Seongmin: I can talk casually with Jaeseung.)

1172
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:50,540
(-Hanmin: Jaeseung is good at taking care of others. -Seongmin: Yeah, though he doesn't look it.)

1173
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:52,940
(Seongmin: He doesn't look that way on the outside but...)

1174
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:54,170
(Hanmin: Once you really chat to Jaeseung you'll realize)

1175
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:58,040
(Hanmin: that things that I might have just ignored,)

1176
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:01,580
(Hanmin: he tends to pay attention to it.)

1177
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:07,350
(Seongmin: I feel like I'm still looking for a longterm relationship.)

1178
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:13,230
(Seongmin: So 'is 22 year old Hwi suitable for me?')

1179
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:18,300
(Seongmin: 'I think Jaeseung would be able to care for me more')

1180
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,430
(Seongmin: was what I thought.)

1181
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:26,270
(-Hanmin: It's so hard. -Seongmin: Yeah... this is hard.)

1182
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:29,910
(-Hanmin: I'll take a photo of you. -Seongmin: Okay.)

1183
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,780
(Seongmin: I won't say no.)

1184
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:37,980
(-Should I pretend to be playing on my phone? -Yeah, that's good.)

1185
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:39,060
(Seongmin: Hanmin was someone I wanted to get to know,)

1186
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,590
Hanmin was someone I wanted to get to know,
(Seongmin: Hanmin was someone I wanted to get to know,)

1187
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:45,460
(Seongmin: but while chatting I thought he was too extreme so I lost a bit of interest.)

1188
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:49,090
(Seongmin: But then I also noticed that Hanmin pays attention to details)

1189
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:51,570
(Seongmin: and I thought 'he must be a loyal friend.')

1190
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:52,550
Wait.
(Seongmin: and I thought 'he must be a loyal friend.')

1191
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:57,300
('Rather than a boyfriend, he's more suitable as a friend.')

1192
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:57,540
(Hanmin: Seongmin is very calm and emotional.)

1193
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,870
Seongmin is very calm and emotional.
(Hanmin: Seongmin is very calm and emotional.)

1194
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:03,240
(Hanmin: He's actually exactly the way I imagined him to be.)

1195
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:09,950
(Hanmin: Um... it was a fun date as roommates.)

1196
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:18,520
(On the other side, what kind of day with Myeongkyun and Minseon spend at home?)

1197
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:20,730
(Minseon: Is it because I don't like vegetables?)

1198
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:24,730
(-Minseon: Watch your hands~ Don't cut yourself again. -Myeongkyun: I won't, I won't cut myself.)

1199
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:30,000
(-Myeongkyun: But I tend to cut myself when I'm cutting apples. -Minseon: But you said you wanted to cut the apples.)

1200
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,810
(Myeongkyun: Because I want to be a troublemaker.)

1201
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:39,240
(Minseon: While I'm here, I really wanted to try having a date at home.)

1202
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,150
(Minseon: There's a lot of things I want to do)

1203
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:42,230
(Minseon: so I was really looking forward to it.)

1204
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,290
so I was really looking forward to it.
(Minseon: so I was really looking forward to it.)

1205
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:48,350
(Myeongkyun: It actually felt more refreshing.)

1206
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:51,220
(Myeongkyun: I felt more freedom, too.)

1207
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:54,590
(Myeongkyun: It felt like we created our own space.)

1208
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:56,190
(Myeongkyun: It felt like that.)

1209
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,000
(Looking around)

1210
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:00,520
(Myeongkyun: I should cover the egg soup with this lid.)

1211
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,780
I should cover the egg soup with this lid.
(Myeongkyun: I should cover the egg soup with this lid.)

1212
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:02,890
(Myeongkyun: The soup might get cold.)

1213
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:04,320
The soup might get cold.
(Myeongkyun: The soup might get cold.)

1214
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:04,740
Nice, I was actually looking for that, too.

1215
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:08,170
(Minseon: Nice, I was actually looking for that, too.)
Nice, I was actually looking for that, too.

1216
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:08,300
(Minseon: I was going to heat it up again.)

1217
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,950
I was going to heat it up again.
(Minseon: I was going to heat it up again.)

1218
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:14,750
(Minseon: Because it's fine to finish making the soup first.)

1219
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:18,070
(Myeongkyun is focused on something)

1220
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:20,460
I also finish really quickly.
(Myeongkyun is focused on something)

1221
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:25,060
(Minseon: It's so funny how you're looking at that while cooking.)

1222
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:32,500
(A room for 4 before dinner last night)

1223
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:34,090
I don't want to write to anyone else.

1224
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:35,320
Gosh.

1225
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,740
(Minseon: What is that?)

1226
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:40,010
(Myeongkyun: These are the recipes I wrote down before coming here.)

1227
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:42,910
(Myeongkyun: I wanted to see if I can make something easy.)

1228
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:43,680
I thought of...

1229
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,640
(Surprised)
I thought of...

1230
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:46,410
(Myeongkyun brought his recipe book filled with dishes he'll make at Men's House)

1231
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:48,480
I plan to make this dish.
(Myeongkyun brought his recipe book filled with dishes he'll make at Men's House)

1232
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,550
(Myeongkyun brought his recipe book filled with dishes he'll make at Men's House)

1233
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:49,780
These are side dishes.

1234
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,120
(Myeongkyun's handwritten recipe book)
These are side dishes.

1235
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,140
(Myeongkyun's handwritten recipe book)

1236
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,100
I wrote so much.
(Myeongkyun's handwritten recipe book)

1237
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,920
(Minseon: I just memorized mine.)

1238
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:58,360
After seeing it, I thought 'he came here with a lot of things he want to do.'

1239
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:04,500
(Minseon: After seeing it, I thought 'he came here with a lot of things he want to do.')
After seeing it, I thought 'he came here with a lot of things he want to do.'

1240
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,700
(Minseon: I think he's amazing.)

1241
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:08,630
(Minseon: He's also pretty cute.)

1242
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:13,810

Look.

1257
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:40,970

(-Myeongkyun: I put too much chili paste. -Minseon: It should taste good with a lot of chili paste.)

Me too.

01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:53,740
It's so cold.
(Even though they didn't go outside, the two made great memories inside Men's House)

1391
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:54,120
(Even though they didn't go outside, the two made great memories inside Men's House)

1392
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,580
I just spilled some water.
(Even though they didn't go outside, the two made great memories inside Men's House)

1393
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,020
(Ah sorry X2)

1394
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:02,590
(-Myeongkyun: I need to fill some water. -Minseon: Is there no more water?)

1395
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:05,130
(This is a chance!)

1396
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:07,500
(Minseon: You should get shot if there's no water.)

1397
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:08,900
(Fights back immediately!)

1398
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:10,760
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,260
-Hands up! Hands up! -Hold on!

1402
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:15,790
Okay, okay.

1403
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,580
(Minseon: But this is what resting is like.)
-But this is what resting is like. -I really...

1404
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:24,250
(Minseon: But this is what resting is like.)

1405
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:26,720
(Minseon: I'm not envious of the people that went outside.)

1406
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,090
(Myeongkyun: Yeah, this is what healing is like.)

1407
01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:33,260
(Myeongkyun: It's like a healing camp.)

1408
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:42,670
(The two are having fun in the water like kids)

1409
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:52,110
(A healing camp for the two of them)

1410
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:53,500
(-Minseon: Should we have some Americano? -Myeongkyun: Sure, sure.)

(Thank you!)

1422
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,070
(Minseon: I didn't bring the film for the polaroid camera.)

1423
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:13,080
(Minseon: I should bring the polaroid film.)

1424
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,930
I have to.
(Minseon: I should bring the polaroid film.)

1425
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:15,090
(Minseon: I'll be right back.)

1426
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:16,540

1429
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,610
(Myeongkyun: It's actually the first time.)

1430
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:31,780
(Myeongkyun: Usually the people I dated wanted to be taken care of,)

1431
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:35,950
(Myeongkyun: so I don't think anyone has done anything for me.)

1432
01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:36,220
(Myeongkyun: Minseon is different and I'm very grateful to him.)

1436
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:46,570
(Minseon: Actually, the coffee maker made it, not me.)

1437
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:49,130
(-Myeongkyun: But the thought comes from you. -Minseon: Of course.)

1438
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:53,670
(Minseon: It's filled with my feelings.)

1439

as well as being taken care of so...
(Minseon: as well as being taken care of so...)

1443
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:04,330

1446
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:19,400
(Minseon: Let's take down those decorations.)

1447
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:25,640
(The two cleaning up the traces of last night's party)

1448
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:29,810
(-Myeongkyun: Today really healed me. -Minseon: Yeah, same here, I'm so happy.)

(Myeongkyun: I'm more of someone who takes time)

1498
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:12,910

1531
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:30,250
(Myeongkyun: what he said to me yesterday.)

1532
01:09:40,859 --> 01:09:47,029
(Myeongkyun makes up his mind and heads towards Youngjoon)

1533
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:52,270
(Myeongkyun: Let's talk outside.)

1534
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:56,640
Let's talk outside

1535
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:57,500
(Glances)
Let's talk outside

1536
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:58,080
(Glances)

1537
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:58,090
(Minseon: I already knew about this since yesterday)

1538
01:09:58,090 --> 01:09:59,850
I already knew about this since yesterday
(Minseon: I already knew about this since yesterday)

1539
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:02,250
(Minseon: and it's their problem so they need to solve it themselves.)

1540
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:05,180
(Minseon: To be honest, it does bother me.)

1541
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:07,090
(Myeongkyun: Youngjoon doesn't look too happy.)

1542
01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:10,450
Youngjoon doesn't look too happy.
(Myeongkyun: Youngjoon doesn't look too happy.)

1543
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:16,830
(Myeongkyun: Though it's true that I upset him,)

1544
01:10:16,830 --> 01:10:20,070
(Myeongkyun: our conversation had no progress)

1545
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:22,330
(Myeongkyun: so I thought I should speak frankly today.)

1546
01:10:22,330 --> 01:10:26,140
(Myeongkyun: It's complicated.)

1547
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:26,260
(Youngjoon: Myeongkyun approached me first and told me seriously)

1548
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:30,450
Myeongkyun approached me first and told me seriously
(Youngjoon: Myeongkyun approached me first and told me seriously)

1549
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:33,080
(Youngjoon: that he wanted to talk to me)

1550
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:36,380
(Youngjoon: so I thought, 'he must have something to say')

1551
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:37,550
(Youngjoon: so I just followed him.)

1552
01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:40,790
(Youngjoon: I also want to get an answer.)

1553
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:47,690
(Can they end this awkward relationship?)

1554
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:49,060
(Jaeseung: Isn't it clear now?)

1555
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:51,160
(Jaeseung: What's happening here.)

1556
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:56,570
(Jaeseung: Hwi, Seongmin and I are in a love triangle.)

1557
01:10:56,570 --> 01:10:58,900
(Hwi: So annoying.)

1558
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:01,540
(Jaeseung: But Hwi seems to see me as competition.)

1559
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:01,830
(*Glance* "Let's try")

1560
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:04,200
Let's try.
(*Glance* "Let's try")

1561
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,240
Whatever.

1562
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:05,470
(Hwi saw Jaeseung and Seongmin downstairs)
Whatever.

1563
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:07,750
(Hwi saw Jaeseung and Seongmin downstairs)

1564
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:10,750
(Stops)

1565
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:13,790
(Two men's competition in order to get one person)

1566
01:11:13,790 --> 01:11:18,060
(They start their story again)

1567
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:20,590
(Youngjoon: That's why I want to ask you now,)

1568
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:23,100
(Youngjoon: do you still have feelings for me?)

1569
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:25,860
(Myeongkyun: I thought we were doing well.)

1570
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:28,870
(-Youngjoon: Us back then? -Myeongkyun: Yeah.)

1571
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:32,670
(Myeongkyun: Though we already know each other, let's try to get to know each other again.)

1572
01:11:33,070 --> 01:11:33,410
I always thought of you.

1573
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:38,510
("I always thought of you.")
I always thought of you.

1574
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:39,650
I think they're back.

1575
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:41,180
-Hello. -You guys are back.

1576
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:43,050
-Hello. -We can eat now.

1577
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:44,120
(Attention)
-Hello. -We can eat now.

1578
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:46,390
(Hanmin: To be honest, I'm nervous.)

1579
01:11:46,690 --> 01:11:48,000
(What does the future hold for the men?)
