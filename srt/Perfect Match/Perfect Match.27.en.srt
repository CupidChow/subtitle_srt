00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,920
EPISODE 27

2
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,680
- My lord.
- I've waited a long time.

3
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,320
I haven't told you yet.

4
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,800
I won't go to the office today.

5
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,840
I gave the medicine to Qingshi.

6
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,320
Just heat it up before you take it.

7
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,280
Yes, my lord. It arrived before dawn.

8
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,080
You left in a rush. I couldn't inform you.

9
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,080
Are you heading to the office?
I'll see you out.

10
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,800
Going out today?

11
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,680
When I returned yesterday,

12
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,800
Granny mentioned arranging a match
for your cousin Fang Yuchan.

13
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,960
You don't need to oversee it yourself.
The matchmaker can handle it, right?

14
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,400
She should make her own choice.

15
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But she's alone in the capital.

16
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,960
She has no elders to guide her.

17
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,920
Granny asked Aunt to assist,

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,880
but it's hard for young women

19
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,280
to speak freely.

20
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,320
Granny asked me

21
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,800
to help with advice.

22
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,920
Can't risk her future.

23
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,560
Two matches today, three tomorrow.

24
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,400
Granny said

25
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,960
we must find a perfect match for her.

26
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,520
Then, do your business.
No need to see me out.

27
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,680
Take care.

28
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,560
- Shall we go?
- Sure.

29
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,680
Enough.

30
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,280
Seven days of meetings nonstop.

31
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,640
Three or four suitors daily.

32
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,600
Talented and rich. You fancy no one.

33
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,480
What are you looking for exactly?

34
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,640
Just tell us

35
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,800
to save our time.

36
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,800
Aunt, these things can't be rushed.

37
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,080
Cousin…

38
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,240
your aunt even introduced past candidates

39
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,160
for Guiniang.

40
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,240
They're from noble,

41
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,600
educated families.

42
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,440
If you have other thoughts,
tell me privately.

43
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,640
Your choices are excellent.

44
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,120
But appearance matters too.

45
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,400
That aspect should be considered.

46
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,120
You heard her. She wants a handsome match.

47
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,080
Of course, we have.

48
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,440
There's one. The wealthy Lu family
from the west.

49
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,720
They own over 20 cargo ships,
a rich household.

50
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,880
Their ninth son, Lu Sheng,

51
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,800
is dashing and refined.

52
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,400
A true gem, cultured and charming,
a rare find.

53
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,600
He's been picky

54
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,360
and hard to match.
They take a lot of time and energy.

55
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,520
Isn't this fate?

56
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,640
But he's studying at the academy.
It's too soon to meet him.

57
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,680
His twin brother looks just like him.

58
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,480
You can barely tell them apart.

59
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,080
Why not meet the brother instead?

60
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,000
That might not be appropriate.

61
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,920
Let's wait until Lu Sheng returns.

62
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,080
I've heard good things

63
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,240
about the Lu brothers.

64
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,160
Meeting the twin is fine too.
They're both great.

65
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,880
Of course. I'll bring him over.
Please wait.

66
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,680
It's already late, but she's still out?

67
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,000
Yes.

68
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,160
When she returns,
have her come to the study immediately.

69
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,040
Yes.

70
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,680
Qingshi, what's wrong with the lord?

71
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,440
He looks so pale.

72
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,840
Xi'er,

73
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,360
no millstone turns without a pivot.

74
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,040
Tell your lady to think carefully.

75
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,400
The one with the yellow flower,
that's him.

76
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,920
There are so many with flowers.
Which one is him?

77
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,760
The one with the yellow flower,

78
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,440
tall and fair-skinned.

79
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,360
Take another look.

80
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,560
What does this mean?

81
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,720
Why is she leaving?

82
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,360
Aunt, I think she's decided.

83
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,040
Please inform the Lu family.

84
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,040
If he is unmarried, let's proceed.

85
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,200
I'll do my best, my lady.

86
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,560
SHEN'S MANSION

87
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,280
Greetings, my lord.

88
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,760
Did you have a good day, my lady?

89
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,560
Thank you for asking. Everything is fine.

90
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,680
What have you been busy with?

91
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,040
I was about to report to you.

92
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,840
Fang chose the Lu family's tenth son.

93
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,240
But his elder brother, the ninth son,
insists that he should marry first.

94
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,560
Good thing is, the ninth son, Lu Sheng,
is a student at Bailu Academy.

95
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,560
He's handsome, poetic,

96
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,760
and even artistic.

97
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,440
A rare gem, perfect for Fang.

98
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,280
Aunt wants to verify his character.

99
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,560
He's truly worthy

100
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,960
of his reputation.

101
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,280
So, this match was done.

102
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,560
Handsome? You saw him?

103
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,800
I only saw him briefly across the street.

104
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,360
But if Fang approves,

105
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,760
his brother should be similar.

106
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,800
So,

107
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,200
you've completed your task?

108
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,680
Making a match isn't that simple.

109
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,240
The dowry is another big task.

110
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,080
Once the engagement is confirmed,
gifts must be exchanged.

111
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,920
The formal ceremony

112
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,960
requires careful preparation.

113
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,760
Not a single mistake can be made.

114
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,840
The Old Lady assigned me to handle it.

115
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,400
I'm nervous about doing it right.

116
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,560
Do you think I can do it?

117
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,600
If you can handle crime cases,

118
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,040
you can, of course, plan a wedding.

119
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,840
If you say so,

120
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,640
I'd believe that.

121
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,920
Then, I'll do my best.

122
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,200
Helping with this wedding

123
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,640
can make up

124
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,360
for what I did to her.

125
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,360
I need to report this to the Old Lady.

126
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,800
If there's anything else,
I'll take my leave now.

127
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,320
Anything else, my lord?

128
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,480
You may go.

129
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,080
Family Fan's cloth shop
is the best in Bianjing.

130
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,720
Not just the silks
from Qingzhou and Qizhou…

131
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,560
My lord.

132
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,040
Where are you going?

133
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,760
I'm taking her to choose wedding fabrics.

134
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,840
I'm grateful for sister-in-law's help.

135
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,200
Thank you, cousin.

136
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,520
We are relatives. No need for thanks.

137
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,520
Go ahead.

138
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,200
The lady's been so busy
with wedding plans.

139
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,360
My lord, I've inquired about it.

140
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,080
The wedding is set for June 18th.
No matter how busy, it'll all end in June.

141
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,440
<i>Husband and wife grow close, then distant.</i>

142
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,080
<i>She keeps her word</i>
<i>to treat each other with respect.</i>

143
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,920
It's time!

144
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,080
Lift the sedan.

145
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:34,720
SHEN'S MANSION

146
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,560
It should be all joyful. You made it.

147
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,760
Yet you feel sad.

148
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,720
<i>She has the groom greeting her</i>
<i>in this life moment.</i>

149
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,480
<i>But I came with a smile on my face</i>
<i>and left with tears. Tragic for me.</i>

150
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,000
<i>I will, of course, feel sad.</i>

151
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,920
You're right.

152
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,720
Granny isn't well and stayed away.

153
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,840
She's likely upset. I'll go comfort her.

154
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,320
Would you like to join me?

155
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,240
It's fine. Just go.

156
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,040
Sure.

157
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,760
Qingshi, Qingshi.

158
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,800
- I'm here.
- Send invitations

159
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,680
to my elder brothers-in-law
to Pan Restaurant.

160
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,840
My lord, you meet Mr. Du daily at court.

161
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,640
What if he asks why?

162
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,800
Tell him I want some advice.

163
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,680
Yes.

164
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,440
<i>Everything feels dull.</i>

165
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,400
<i>I'd rather join Brother at his desk.</i>

166
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,200
<i>Sweet talks first</i>

167
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,320
<i>and then take control by punishments.</i>

168
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,240
<i>You need to punish him hard</i>
<i>for him to learn the lessons.</i>

169
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,520
<i>Until he regrets his missteps,</i>

170
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
<i>I must hold myself.</i>

171
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,080
<i>I have no choice but to endure.</i>

172
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,080
My lady.

173
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,000
Lord is waiting for you in the garden.

174
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,640
Let's go.

175
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,960
PEACEFUL VIBES

176
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,120
Orchids are the most popular this season.

177
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,360
Vendors sell them in the early mornings.

178
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,160
All sold out by dawn.

179
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,480
How did you know I love orchids?

180
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,960
I also know you like wearing flowers.

181
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,080
Always adorned with fragrant blooms.

182
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,120
The scent in this pavilion, what is it?

183
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,360
Didn't Sifu House
sell incense cakes and powders?

184
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,440
You can't tell?

185
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,400
With orchids and jasmine in this garden,

186
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,360
it's hard to pinpoint the fragrance.

187
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,760
Last year at the palace banquet,

188
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,200
His Majesty gifted ambergris incense
to us all.

189
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,800
It smelled too musky.
So, I kept mine in storage.

190
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,120
I heard you love incense,
so I had it retrieved.

191
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,080
Is that so?

192
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,720
I know you dislike the heat.

193
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,120
I stopped by a shop for cooling drinks.

194
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,320
Fresh treats

195
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,480
sent from the estate today.

196
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,760
Try some.

197
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,240
This plum blossom wine

198
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,280
is from Liang's shop.

199
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,800
The blossoms were picked in early winter.
Preserved in honey jars with salt.

200
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,840
Wait until June for it to brew.

201
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,280
We sell it too,

202
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,320
but it's less fragrant.

203
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,480
I used to sneak out

204
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,920
with Leshan to buy it.

205
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,400
That's not a stop-by.

206
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,800
You bought it just for me?

207
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,320
Haode, I just

208
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,880
wanted to make you happy.

209
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,760
Happy? I'm very happy.

210
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,440
You don't need to trouble yourself for me.

211
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,840
I lack nothing in this house.

212
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,480
Though it's hot,
too much cold drink isn't good

213
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,400
for the health.

214
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,680
My lord, bees! Bees!

215
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,840
Qingshi! Qingshi!

216
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,800
- Remove the flowers.
- My lord.

217
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,160
- Don't sting me.
- Hurry.

218
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,480
- Come here.
- Don't sting me.

219
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,320
- Hurry! Move them all!
- Hurry up!

220
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,520
- Quick!
- Huizhao.

221
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,720
- Move them all.
- Hurry up.

222
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,040
Come here.

223
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,840
Haode, it's okay.

224
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,440
Brother.

225
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,760
There are flowers everywhere,
yet you still burn incense.

226
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,480
Are you upset I've been distant lately?

227
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,960
Is this to tease me?

228
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,440
Of course not.

229
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,160
Your brothers-in-law suggested this…

230
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,840
My brothers-in-law?

231
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,840
I wasn't sure what you liked.

232
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,680
So, I asked them for advice.

233
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,560
They said you love flowers,
fragrance, and elegance.

234
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,160
That's why I tried to please you.

235
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,440
I'm sorry.

236
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,760
Does it hurt? Let me see.

237
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,120
Wife's favors,

238
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,800
you can know from daily life.
Why ask others?

239
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,280
I fear I've been too attentive before.

240
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,120
Now you've seen me change my way,

241
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,600
you feel bad

242
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,280
and make insincere flattery.

243
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,680
People value what's hard to obtain.

244
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,520
Once they have it, it feels less special.

245
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,520
If I give you my heart,

246
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,280
will you change and leave me behind again?

247
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,840
Couples can live without deep love,

248
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,120
as long as there's respect.

249
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,720
But if you constantly fool me

250
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,400
with disrespect,

251
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,640
our marriage will end soon.

252
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,640
Haode.

253
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,600
Haode.

254
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,920
OFFICIAL RANKING LIST

255
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,520
Aren't you still upset?

256
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,360
Why come here?

257
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,320
Just speaking my mind. Who said I'm upset?

258
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,200
I'm not that petty.

259
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,240
A few days out of the study,
and it's a mess.

260
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,400
Qingshi deserves punishment.

261
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,240
I told him not to clean up.

262
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,880
If it's neat, you'd never come back.

263
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,560
Haode.

264
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,200
You've done so much for me,
I want to do something for you too.

265
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,760
But for so many years,

266
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,200
I've never tried to impress a woman.

267
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,160
I don't know how to do it.

268
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,560
Could you forgive me for being rusty?

269
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,760
I'd never blame you.

270
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,320
I painted it for you.

271
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,000
But they said you prefer flowers
and incense.

272
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,360
If you like jeweled hairpins, I can…

273
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,640
Did I mess up again?

274
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,120
Forget it. The painting isn't good.

275
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,400
My sisters told me
to be reserved and strategic.

276
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,120
But I'm not them. I can't do that.

277
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,920
What I treasure

278
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,600
isn't flowers or jewels.

279
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,640
It's a person.

280
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,040
I love his honesty and integrity.

281
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,520
I admire his devotion to justice

282
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,760
and truth.

283
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,560
I love his straightforwardness

284
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,440
and his rusty behavior.

285
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,680
I don't need him to learn from others.

286
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,320
I don't need playful moments with him.

287
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,160
I just want

288
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,520
a promise from him.

289
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,560
Haode.

290
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,040
I'll never let you go,

291
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,120
never lie to you, never hide from you,
never hurt you again.

292
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,760
You're the mistress of the Shen family

293
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,720
and my only wife.

294
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,680
So, Brother,

295
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,040
did you find a solution to your worries?

296
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,200
I've figured out these days,

297
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,280
I don't want you mistreated by others.

298
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,120
I don't want you suffering
somewhere I can't see.

299
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,960
Nor do I want you here

300
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,000
but keeping distance.

301
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,320
This makes me feel uncertain
and out of reach.

302
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,800
Compared to the old traumas,

303
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,000
I am now afraid more

304
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,720
of losing you.

305
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,800
Promise me,

306
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,640
if you lie to me again,

307
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,240
- I'll--
- Never forgive me, never come back.

308
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,560
Never look back again.

309
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,760
I barely got a good look at it.

310
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,960
Haode, you're so unpredictable.

311
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,920
Among my sisters,
I'm the easiest to please.

312
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,320
I haven't even used

313
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,800
half my tricks yet.

314
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,480
Then I should

315
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,880
pity my brothers-in-law.

316
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,920
- What did you say?
- I said…

317
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,920
This painting looks like you
but doesn't get your spirit.

318
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,800
It can't compare to the real you at all.

319
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,440
I'll paint another for you someday.

320
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,200
It's nothing. I'll go check on it.

321
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,960
My lord.

322
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,320
I can't handle it.

323
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,280
Haode.

324
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,280
Didn't you say no one would disturb us?

325
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,000
Are you deceiving me again?

326
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,440
There's a murder at the Lu house.
Fang is accused.

327
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,440
What?

328
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,600
My lord, there was no fraudulent marriage.

329
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,240
It was my tenth son who went to meet her.

330
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,040
When the matchmaker proposed,

331
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,880
we didn't want to mess up
the family order.

332
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,640
So, we arranged for my ninth son.

333
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,680
After setting the marriage date,
we wrote to him

334
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,800
to return for the wedding.

335
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,960
But he took a shortcut to be on time.

336
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,000
Robbers attacked him,

337
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,600
leaving him scarred.

338
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,560
At the time of the betrothal,

339
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,160
he was handsome and talented.

340
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,320
This accident can't be called deception.

341
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Moreover, once a marriage is promised,

342
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,720
wealth, status, or beauty
shouldn't matter.

343
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,040
That vicious woman

344
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,880
despised his appearance.
She schemed to murder him.

345
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,840
If he was injured on the way,

346
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,600
why didn't you explain before the wedding?

347
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,960
And who exactly came for the bride?

348
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,640
My lord,
it wasn't intentional concealment.

349
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,160
The wedding date was fixed,

350
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,840
invitations sent.

351
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,880
A delay would've brought bad luck.

352
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,640
Who would do that?

353
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,200
We hoped the bride would join early
and dispel the misfortune.

354
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,680
My son couldn't show his injured face.

355
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,840
Luckily, they look alike, and people
can't tell the difference between them.

356
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,520
So, his brother acted as the groom.

357
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,680
That's not against the law, is it?

358
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,120
Still trying to cover it up?

359
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,040
Even if it wasn't fraud, it was deceit.

360
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,880
Before marriage, you should've explained,

361
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,760
waited for him to recover,

362
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,880
or annulled it. Both are okay.

363
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,360
Hiding the truth
forced the bride to comply.

364
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,120
My lord,
we admit the fault for concealing this.

365
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,880
Punish us however you see fit.

366
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,000
But Fang's attempted murder is heinous.

367
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,720
She deserves the death penalty.
Please judge fairly, my lord.

368
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,160
Haode, you're finally here!

369
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,360
- Don't cry yet.
- Haode.

370
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,200
Tell me. What happened exactly?

371
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,680
Sit here.

372
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,600
Haode.

373
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,120
On my wedding night,

374
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,840
the front hall feast went on forever.

375
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,360
The servants in the room were sent away.

376
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,160
I got tired waiting

377
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,760
and dozed off.

378
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,880
<i>In the middle of the night, I heard</i>

379
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,560
- <i>three drumbeats.</i>
- My lady.

380
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,600
- <i>Then I saw…</i>
- Wake up.

381
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,520
My lady, wake up.

382
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,560
- Hey.
- Who are you?

383
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,200
My lady, I'm Lu Sheng.

384
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,160
- I don't know you. Go away.
- What's wrong?

385
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,040
- My lady, I'm Lu Sheng.
- Don't touch me!

386
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,560
- Don't be scared.
- It's me.

387
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,280
- I'm Lu Sheng.
- I don't know you.

388
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,360
Don't touch me! Go away!

389
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,080
- Don't be scared.
- Don't touch me!

390
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,480
Why did you carry a weapon with you?

391
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,280
The trip to the capital was long.

392
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,000
I feared bandits,

393
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,320
so I had one made.
I wore it under my dress.

394
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,680
The skirt covered it. No one noticed.

395
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,160
I meant to remove it before the wedding.

396
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,520
But as an orphan with only one servant,

397
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,360
I feared gossip about my character.

398
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,680
Showing the dagger to my husband
would prove my purity.

399
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,640
Who'd think it would cause this disaster?

400
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,560
Haode.

401
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,360
Is Lu Sheng dead yet?

402
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,600
He's not dead,

403
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,640
but not alive either.

404
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,360
He's hanging by a thread.

405
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,360
If he dies,

406
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,040
won't I be buried with him?

407
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,560
Haode, I was terrified.

408
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,920
I didn't mean to kill him.

409
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,240
I didn't mean it!

410
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,040
Haode.

411
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,440
- Please help me!
- Yuchan.

412
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,640
- Haode.
- Yuchan, get up.

413
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,880
- Haode.
- This won't do.

414
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,960
- Please save my life, Haode.
- Get up.

415
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,200
Now, the Lu family claims in unison

416
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,160
that you planned to murder Lu Sheng.

417
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,400
According to Song law,

418
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,880
killing one's husband is a heinous crime.

419
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,120
It's one of the ten great evils.

420
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,840
I… I can't help you.

421
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,360
A heinous crime…

422
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,760
Yuchan! Yuchan!

423
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,160
Brother, the Lu family deceived her first.

424
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,240
This whole thing seems absurd.
I doubt it too.

425
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,560
After investigating, we found Lu Sheng
was indeed injured by bandits.

426
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,440
Merchant Wang Mu

427
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,600
and Dr. Liu Zaichang can both testify.

428
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,040
The fraud claim is baseless.

429
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,000
But they did hide the truth.

430
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,280
If Lu's family admitted it earlier,
what would you have done?

431
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,680
Cancel the wedding.

432
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,040
And if the Lu family refused?

433
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,800
They'd take it to court in Kaifeng.

434
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,480
Any betrothed woman who backs out

435
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,000
would be punished with 60 lashes.

436
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,240
Even if she's promised to another,
she must return to her original fiancé.

437
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,040
Haode.

438
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,200
The contract is no trivial matter.

439
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,840
Canceling a wedding over appearance

440
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,520
is no better

441
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,480
than the Deng family's greed.

442
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,840
Yuchan turned herself in,

443
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,760
so her penalty should be reduced.

444
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,280
But harming her husband
is excluded from leniency.

445
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,960
She was terrified that night.

446
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,880
It was understandable
to make such mistake.

447
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,160
If the Lu family had been honest,
this wouldn't have happened.

448
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,600
Lu Sheng is only injured.
Her crime doesn't warrant death.

449
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,720
It's pointless.

450
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,320
By law, her crime is punishable by death.

451
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,480
My lord.

452
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,400
Official Du and Commander Qiao are here.

453
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,360
- Let them in.
- Sure.

454
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,080
My lady, Leshan is looking for you.

455
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,000
Got it.

456
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,920
Haode.

457
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,880
<i>Is the court sentencing Yuchan to death?</i>

458
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,200
<i>Shen told you this himself?</i>

459
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,920
Murdering her husband.
Is it beheading or cutting from the waist?

460
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,400
Leshan, stop it.

461
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,320
Why are you here?

462
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,840
Haode, don't be mad.

463
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,520
Everyone in Bianjing

464
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,640
is watching this case. Even Mom is.

465
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,240
I prepared Yuchan's dowry myself.

466
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,920
Seeing her like this,

467
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,720
I can't bear it.

468
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,440
I keep thinking of a way to save her.

469
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,760
Murdering her husband
on the wedding night.

470
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,760
Even the gods can't save her now.

471
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,840
Haode, why not ask her

472
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,600
if she has any last wishes?

473
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,320
We can help her fulfill them
and ease her mind.

474
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,960
Isn't that Cui from Yuchan's side?

475
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,440
What's she sneaking around for?

476
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,080
If Master's spirit is watching,

477
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,920
please protect my young lady.

478
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,400
Don't let her die alone

479
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,400
as a wandering ghost.

480
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,040
Don't let her

481
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,560
end up without a burial place.

482
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,560
Please. Please protect her.

483
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,080
Cui.

484
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,720
You wretched maid.

485
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,520
Running off after seeing my sister.
What guilt are you hiding?

486
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,400
How could I dare, living under your roof?

487
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,520
I was just mourning for my young lady,

488
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,400
alone and helpless,

489
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,840
hoping for a place to stand in this world.

490
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,080
I thought she'd found a good match.

491
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,320
Who'd expect it to end like this?

492
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,800
I just hate the heavens' unfairness.
All I could do was cry for her.

493
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,640
She was rejected here and there.

494
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,280
But she chose the Lu family herself.

495
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,000
Your words are full of blame
for my sister.

496
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,640
She helped prepare her marriage greatly.
Now, it's all her fault?

497
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,880
What were you just burning?
Are you cursing my sister?

498
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,280
I wouldn't dare! I was only…

499
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,560
Praying for your lady's blessing?
Then, why hide it?

500
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,200
Who were you mourning before I came?

501
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,120
<i>Murdering a husband is a death sentence.</i>

502
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,280
<i>If you want Yuchan to live,</i>
<i>there's only one way.</i>

503
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,840
My lady, may I say?

504
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,480
I've visited the Lu family
to check on Lu Sheng.

505
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,880
He's still in a fevered coma.

506
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,080
The Lu family is furious.

507
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,880
They insist on sentencing her to death.

508
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,800
That's troubling.

509
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,720
If Lu Sheng survives,
Yuchan may have a chance.

510
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,360
If not, she faces execution.

511
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,920
- Qiao Du.
- My lord?

512
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,560
Send men to watch over the Lu family.
Report immediately if he wakes.

513
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,680
Understood.

514
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,680
This can't wait.

515
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,280
This case

516
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,400
has the whole city's attention.

517
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,600
The verdict should be out tomorrow,
so I came here for instructions.

518
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,400
Should we sentence her to dismemberment?

519
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,520
You're the presiding judge.

520
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,640
Do it by the law. It's your call.

521
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,080
No, no.

522
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,800
Absolutely not!

523
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,160
Haode, we're discussing the murder case.

524
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,440
Don't act rash.

525
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,240
Official Du,

526
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,680
what's the punishment for marrying
during mourning?

527
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,560
Children must observe mourning
for their parents.

528
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,040
Marrying in mourning is disrespectful.

529
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,920
It also violates state law.

530
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,400
During mourning, marriages are annulled

531
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,560
with a three-year sentence and a divorce.

532
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,960
So, they can't remain husband and wife?

533
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,560
She was engaged before her mourning ended?

534
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,640
Not just engaged.

535
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,720
Today is her last mourning day.

536
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,320
I saw Cui sneaking off earlier,
burning offerings.

537
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,040
I questioned her, and she admitted it.

538
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,640
Turns out, they feared

539
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,000
her stepmother's provocations.

540
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,920
They lied about the mourning ending,

541
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,520
rushed the marriage to escape.

542
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,480
So, Fang stabbing Lu Sheng

543
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,800
isn't a murder case. Also,
it can't be seen as a great evil.

544
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,280
Murderers get a three-year sentence,

545
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,360
but injurers face strangulation.

546
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,440
She still can't escape death.

547
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,440
Yuchan confessed

548
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,720
immediately after arrest.

549
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,640
The injury was to an outsider.

550
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,760
Turning herself in reduces her sentence.

551
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,000
Strangulation becomes exile.

552
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,080
Under the law,

553
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,920
exile spans 3,000 miles.
She can take 20 lashes instead.

554
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,160
Plus--

555
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,120
One year of labor.

556
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,680
Fine, marrying in mourning
unexpectedly saved her life.

557
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,000
What a twist of fate, life from death!

558
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,880
But marrying during mourning
defies morality.

559
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,680
Taking a life is even more heartless.

560
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,840
Why would you go to such lengths
for someone like her?

561
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,360
If she's good, I defend her.

562
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,160
If she's bad, I still defend her.

563
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,520
Because her crime doesn't warrant death.

564
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,480
Haode,

565
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,520
you've grown so impressive

566
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,920
since marrying Lord Shen.

567
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,360
Yuchan owes her life to you.
You saved her.

568
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,640
Credit should go
to my fair brother-in-law.

569
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,480
Qiao Du, send someone to Hangzhou

570
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,240
to investigate the Fang family.

571
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,280
- Write a full report.
- Yes.

572
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,240
Brother, you're being overly cautious.

573
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,600
Even if Yuchan was careless,

574
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,760
she wouldn't forget

575
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,960
her own father's mourning period.

576
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,160
This is too serious. Cui wouldn't lie.

577
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,960
Just a routine check. Go.

578
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,840
Right away, my lord.

579
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,320
- You?
- Since my brother-in-law is here,

580
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,360
and we've discussed the case,

581
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,920
let's move to the tea hall.

582
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,280
I've got some Jianzhou white tea.

583
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,840
It's the finest tea in the world.
I'd like to share it with you.

584
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,800
Haode, your charm is something else.

585
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,920
Lord Shen finishes court business,

586
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,120
and then entertains guests?

587
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,840
- Please.
- Please.

588
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,520
SIFU HOUSE

589
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,720
CLOSED FOR A DAY

590
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,480
She married before mourning ended.

591
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,280
So, it's not murder of her husband.

592
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,440
Mom, you should've seen Haode today.

593
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,120
She even outwitted Du.

594
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,360
I don't think so.

595
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,480
He's great at governance

596
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,800
and cases.

597
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,240
I think

598
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,360
he's showing mercy to Yunchan,
letting her off.

599
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,040
But you were the one who found the flaw.

600
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,280
Without that, Yuchan was done for.

601
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,120
Mom, don't you think I'm right?

602
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,160
- Mom?
- Mom?

603
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,000
Why are your eyes red?

604
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,680
My Haode's grown up.

605
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,440
You're so capable now.

606
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,240
I barely recognize you.

607
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,800
- Mom.
- I'm just happy for you.

608
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,360
If I'd set this up myself,

609
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,640
I could've made a fortune.

610
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,320
Mom, what are you even saying?

611
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,360
Come here. Give me a hug.

612
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,440
Come here.

613
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,720
Mom.

614
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,560
I wish you'd all never grow up.

615
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,920
Then you'd always stay by my side.

616
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,040
But that's not how life works.

617
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,480
One day, I'll grow too old

618
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,080
to protect you.

619
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,040
That's why

620
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,720
you need to stand strong.

621
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,560
Mother, once Yuchan's case ends,

622
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,640
I'll move back home. I miss you so much.

623
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,600
Alright, alright.

624
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,960
Find someone for you sisters.

625
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,760
They haven't found anyone suitable yet.

626
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,280
My husband won't be easy to find.

627
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,280
He must be smarter than Du.

628
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,120
And funnier than Fan.

629
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,320
Richer than Chai
and more respectful than Shen.

630
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,440
- Right?
- Why are you scoffing?

631
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,400
Nonsense.

632
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,920
Find someone devoted to you.

633
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,800
- Someone who'll cherish only you.
- Sure.

634
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,160
Haode,

635
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,200
you're here. It's chaos outside right now.

636
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,320
- What happened?
- The marketplace is buzzing.

637
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,640
Many are discussing the case.

638
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,160
Lord Shen is impeached.

639
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,760
Officers from the Censorate claim
he favors family in court.

640
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,920
What's going on?

641
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,400
All higher courts
insist she violated the law.

642
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,200
And they know she's in a mourning period,
yet they still charged her with murder.

643
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,040
They're insisting on a death sentence.
It's completely unjust.

644
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,360
That's absurd.

645
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,560
Dali Supreme Court argued,
even if this broke tradition,

646
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,040
she's an orphan, poor and helpless.

647
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,440
For survival,

648
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,160
marrying in mourning isn't rare.

649
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,240
Officials have often shown leniency.

650
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,960
Their families followed tradition.

651
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,080
But without legal resolution,

652
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,920
their marriage isn't officially annulled.

653
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,320
So, they're still a couple.

654
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,760
Breaking the law for sentiment?

655
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,120
If they cared about humanity,
why sentence her to death?

656
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,280
My lord, the palace has summoned you.

657
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,400
The officials
must've brought this case forward.

658
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,400
I handled the case,
but they're blaming you.

659
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,680
They're accusing you of favoritism.

660
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,600
They want to use this case
to stir trouble.

661
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,240
I'll go with you to explain.

662
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,720
I oversee Kaifeng Court.

663
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,200
Even if you judged this case,

664
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,280
you can't report it without my approval.

665
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,640
The palace summoned me. I'll go alone.

666
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,440
How will you argue alone against others?

667
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,560
Trust me.

668
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,160
My lady, you should advise him

669
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,040
to accept the death sentence and end this.

670
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,280
A life hangs in the balance.

671
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,200
How can we change the verdict out of fear?

672
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,640
He won't agree to it.

673
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,240
The lord has always been fair and just.

674
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,320
He's offended many powerful officials.

675
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,200
He'll become a target for this case.

676
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,960
Will they sentence her to death?

677
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,640
Some officials believe
she doesn't deserve it.

678
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,640
But public opinion drowns them out.

679
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,760
I fear Yuchan

680
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,120
may not escape.

681
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,960
My husband said
mobs are surrounding the court.

682
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,240
They demand the sentence
be changed to death. Ridiculous.

683
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,000
His Majesty has ordered a joint trial.

684
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,800
But most officials support
the death sentence.

685
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,720
Even the two lords

686
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,280
could be implicated.

687
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,720
I came today

688
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,040
to ask for your help.
Convince Lord Du to reconsider.

689
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,280
If we act now,
it'll be seen as justice served.

690
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,320
Any later, it might be too late.

691
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,000
I don't interfere with his work.

692
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,480
He's stubborn by nature.
Advice won't sway him.

693
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,480
I told you this trip was pointless.

694
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,080
Shouhua would never ask him to change.

695
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,160
Kangning, you're the one with ideas.
The priority now is saving her.

696
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,840
Shouhua,

697
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,880
your calmness is surprising.
It's about his officialdom.

698
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,880
You don't want him to be punished, right?

699
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,520
It's not that I won't. It's that I can't.

700
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,720
Unless someone can turn the tide,

701
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,120
there's nothing I can do.

702
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,000
Do you have a plan, Mr. Qiao?

703
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,560
Why not just say it?

704
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,200
This shouldn't be done recklessly.

705
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,000
But the lord's been like a brother to me.

706
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,320
I can't stand by
while he refuses to change it.

707
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,640
The storm is here, and there's no escape.

708
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,960
If we want to get rid of it…

709
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,240
- Unless…
- Unless what?

710
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,720
Unless we remove the root of this mess.
Forget it.

711
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,640
Pretend I never came.

712
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,720
Unless Fang Yuchan dies immediately,

713
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,000
the case ends for good. Is that right?

714
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,760
What are you saying?

715
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,200
LIU'S PHARMACY

716
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,720
Haode, this is risky.

717
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,960
If it goes wrong, we all go down.

718
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,040
Shouldn't we talk to Shen first?

719
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,800
Would he agree?

720
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,760
Enough. I've made my decision.

721
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,000
Don't talk me out of it.

722
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,200
Thank you, my lady.

723
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,400
This isn't the only trouble I'll handle.

724
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,160
Shouhua said
her husband takes on everything.

725
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,320
I think you're the same.

726
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,800
You promised not to hide things from me.

727
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,320
But when things happen, here we are again.

728
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,400
Haode.

729
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,920
I just didn't want to worry you.

730
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,760
You were ready to send me away before.

731
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,880
Now, it seems you can't be without me.

732
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,520
Brother,

733
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,200
I'll help you, even without being asked.

734
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,360
Thank you, my lady.

735
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,040
Write it down.

736
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,000
Tonight

737
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,520
will not be easy.

738
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,400
Dr. Liu, when will my son wake up?

739
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,840
His injuries are severe. He's very weak.

740
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,840
I've changed his prescription. Let's wait.

741
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,880
Lord Xue,

742
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,400
I could never commit such an evil act.

743
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,800
Please, spare my life.

744
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,760
People only know Dr. Liu's fame.

745
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:06,960
But they don't know
you sell faulty medicine.

746
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,200
How many lives has it taken?

747
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,880
Lord Xue!

748
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,640
I… I…

749
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,120
What's going on?

750
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,320
Help!

751
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,240
Someone help! The prisoner is ill.

752
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,160
Someone help!

753
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,800
Stop right there.

754
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,840
The Supreme Court's reviewed the case

755
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,680
under His Majesty's order.

756
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,800
I'm about to question the key suspect.

757
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:11,280
Where are you taking her?

758
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,080
Lord Xue, the prisoner fell suddenly ill.

759
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,400
She had chills, fever, and then delusions.

760
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,640
With this summer heat,
malaria spreads fast.

761
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,760
To prevent an outbreak,

762
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,040
we'll isolate her.
I've reported to Lord Shen.

763
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,120
She's ready to be sent to the infirmary

764
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,600
to control the spread of disease.

765
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,600
Malaria?

766
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,360
This is clearly an attempt
to free the prisoner.

767
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,800
- Arrest them all!
- Yes, my lord.

768
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,720
