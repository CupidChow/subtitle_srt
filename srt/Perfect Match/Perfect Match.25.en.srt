00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,480
EPISODE 25

2
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,720
We'll know exactly how Ms. Ji died
when we open the coffin.

3
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,240
You don't have to worry about it.

4
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,640
That's not why I'm worried.

5
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,920
Brother, Qiao Du is an official of Congyi.

6
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,160
It means that he's
a second-ranked martial Juren.

7
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,480
Pity that our country
values literature over martial arts.

8
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,080
A martial Juren's prospects can't rival
those of someone like Master Du,

9
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,000
a second-ranked scholar, at all.

10
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,160
He has no fixed residence in Bianjing
and lives in the office now.

11
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,800
If he gets married someday,
he'll have to rent a place.

12
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,160
How much is his monthly salary?

13
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,200
Is it enough to support a family?

14
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,800
I don't know.

15
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,640
However, the rich have their ways
and the poor have theirs.

16
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,720
Even if a couple lives in a humble place,

17
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,360
as long as the husband and wife
love and respect each other,

18
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,120
it's always better than the intrigue,
scheming, and indifference

19
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,280
in the homes of the rich and noble, right?

20
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,200
You…

21
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,320
Qingshi.
Stop at the Liang's roast duck shop ahead.

22
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,800
Old Lady likes their duck bones.

23
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,920
Yes.

24
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,520
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

25
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,120
Speaking of praying for a child,

26
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,080
Yanyue Hermitage in the western suburbs
of Bianjing is the most efficacious.

27
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,240
Many women who have been infertile
for years have gone there

28
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,720
before conceiving soon.

29
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,680
I'll take Guiniang to pray
and offer incense in two days.

30
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,560
Mother,
how about taking Huizhao's wife with us?

31
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,240
The vegetarian food there
is also famous in Bianjing.

32
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,520
Guiniang has only been married
for a few days.

33
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,240
Aren't you being a bit too hasty?

34
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,800
All right.

35
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,920
I appreciate your kind intentions.

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,800
Let's take Haode with us
when the time comes

37
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,760
to listen to the sounds of Buddha,
enjoy the beautiful scenery,

38
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,720
and savor the vegetarian cuisine.

39
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,440
It's a refined affair, isn't it?

40
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,560
Huizhao, what's wrong?

41
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,960
You don't look well.

42
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,280
I'm fine, Aunt. You need not worry.

43
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,200
Old Lady, I need to work in my study.
I'll take my leave.

44
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,200
Go ahead.

45
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,320
Did he find something upsetting
at the government office today?

46
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,840
What's with his displeased look?

47
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,800
Exactly.

48
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,800
One who doesn't know, might think
I have done something wrong again.

49
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,800
He's making a long face.
I wonder who offended him.

50
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,640
Didn't you say your headaches
have been getting worse recently?

51
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,600
I asked the physician
and got a new prescription

52
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,520
that includes Szechuan Lovage,
Notopterygium, and Asarum,

53
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,360
herbs that unblock meridians
and relieve pain.

54
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,840
I've finished it. You may go.

55
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,960
I've finished reviewing tonight's files.

56
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,120
There's nothing you need to help with.

57
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,240
You can go back.

58
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,400
Brother, do you know why I went
to speak with Mr. Qiao today?

59
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,280
You said that we have
a one-year agreement.

60
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,360
You must be making early plans
to find yourself an ideal new husband.

61
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,040
But it's a government office,
and he's an official.

62
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,600
Even if you have taken a fancy to him,
it won't come to fruition soon.

63
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,320
You'd better disturb him less,

64
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,160
lest it invite criticism.

65
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,440
As for what happens after a year…

66
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
it's no longer my concern.

67
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,160
Where did these strange ideas come from?
When did I say I had taken a fancy to him?

68
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,800
I do want to find an ideal gentleman,
but it's not for myself.

69
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,240
My sister Qiongnu is not married yet.

70
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,600
I have to help her
and pay close attention.

71
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,320
Is that so?

72
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,920
You have discerning eyes.
Please do not wrong me.

73
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,520
I already have you.
Why should I seek another gentleman?

74
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,680
Our relationship is an act after all.
It's not real.

75
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,200
Then, are you hiding this
for someone to give it to?

76
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,240
Who allowed you to touch my things?
This isn't for you.

77
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,080
We had an agreement between us.
In one year…

78
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,480
I cannot break the agreement. I cannot--

79
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,080
The agreement is broken,
and the oath is disobeyed.

80
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,680
Are you still cold-hearted
and refusing to yield to me?

81
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,640
After all, you learned Taoism
from a young age.

82
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,360
With an undisturbed heart,
the mundane desires cannot intrude on you.

83
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,080
Never mind. Maybe a forced union
won't be happy after all.

84
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,400
Forgive my transgression tonight.

85
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,840
Please do not take offense.

86
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,160
Now I am familiar with the works
in the government office,

87
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,000
I won't easily reveal any flaws.

88
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,960
You don't have to come with me.

89
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,000
When you have spare time,
visit Sifu House more often

90
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,000
and talk more
with your mother and sisters.

91
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,560
I need to accompany Grandmother
to Yanyue Hermitage today.

92
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,080
My sisters have agreed to go as well.

93
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,520
Take care.

94
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,040
Come out.

95
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,280
My lord, the sedan is ready.

96
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,520
If you dare eavesdrop again,
you'll receive ten beatings first.

97
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,720
My lord, the coffin has been dug out.

98
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,680
But the Deng's brought people
to cause a scene.

99
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,040
YANYUE HERMITAGE

100
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,920
Amitabha.

101
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,720
Esteemed patrons, you must be tired
from traveling.

102
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,400
Tea has been prepared inside the nunnery.

103
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,640
Please rest at the meditation room
for a while

104
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,480
before offering incense to Buddha.

105
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,680
Thank you, Master.

106
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,880
Where is your abbess, Master Zhiyuan?

107
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,640
And her two disciples,

108
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,200
Huide and Huixing?

109
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,320
Three days ago, I specially sent someone

110
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,520
to deliver her a message,

111
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,800
saying that we would be coming.

112
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,080
Why haven't they come out to greet us?

113
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,200
My master and two senior sisters have gone

114
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,600
to Zhenyang Nunnery in Luoyang
to attend a dharma assembly

115
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,800
and won't return until the fifth day
of the next month.

116
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,520
Ladies, please.

117
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,880
LOTUS SUTRA

118
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,360
You are pious.

119
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,840
As long as you offer
the Universal Gate chapter

120
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,440
of the Lotus Sutra you transcribed by hand
in front of the Bodhisattva

121
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,160
and pray sincerely every day,
once your merits are fulfilled,

122
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,120
the Bodhisattva will bless you

123
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,240
with a child
and everything going your way.

124
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,600
Amitabha.

125
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,240
I appreciate your auspicious words.

126
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,000
If our wishes are fulfilled,

127
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,560
I am willing to fund the construction

128
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,920
of a new lecture hall for Yanyue Hermitage

129
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,480
to facilitate the teaching of scriptures
and the propagating of Buddhism.

130
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,080
Old Lady, you're zealous
and find joy in charity.

131
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,520
It's all recorded in the book of merits.

132
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,240
The Bodhisattva knows of your devout heart

133
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,480
and will surely fulfill your wishes soon.

134
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,440
Amitabha.

135
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,800
You all must be tired and thirsty
after traveling half a day,

136
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,320
especially since Old Lady
is advanced in years.

137
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,280
I'm afraid you might lack the energy
to listen to Buddhist teachings now.

138
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,240
It might be better to have some tea
and refreshments first

139
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,120
before I take you all into the hall later.

140
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,840
Amitabha.

141
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,240
Serve the tea.

142
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,280
Watch out.

143
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,880
It's fine.

144
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,680
<i>What does this mean?</i>

145
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,200
With you, the esteemed guests, here,

146
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,680
it is indeed fortunate.

147
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,400
I fear that the humble tea and simple meal
might be insufficient hospitality.

148
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,840
Please take a short rest, everyone.

149
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,320
I will go down first to make arrangements.

150
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,040
You are too kind.

151
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,040
We feel flattered. We will wait here.

152
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,480
Please go ahead.

153
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,600
FEAR NO SENSATIONS

154
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,200
This nun is so strange.

155
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,040
She's neither nun-like nor secular.
Something seems off with her.

156
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,360
Haode.

157
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,080
Old Lady wishes to rest for a moment.

158
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,880
We don't need you here. You may leave now.

159
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,120
Our master has given orders.

160
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,280
Fearing you might have instructions,
we dare not leave without her permission.

161
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,400
Please excuse us.

162
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,200
Everyone, let's have some tea.

163
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
Don't drink it, Old Lady.

164
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,120
Yanyue Hermitage seems somewhat amiss.

165
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,680
Indeed.

166
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,920
We've come all this way
and have seen no other pilgrims.

167
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,280
And there are only a few young nuns
in the nunnery.

168
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,360
It is eerily quiet everywhere,
which is very strange.

169
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,160
What's so strange about that?

170
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,280
Perhaps they are all reciting scriptures
in the hall.

171
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,280
I came to Yanyue Hermitage
with my mother before.

172
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,320
These young nuns look very unfamiliar.

173
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,360
Never have I seen them before.

174
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,520
Ms. Liu.

175
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
Old Lady?

176
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,000
Take some people out to have a look.

177
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,600
Then go to the backyard
and call everyone here.

178
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,560
Yes.

179
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,280
We've brought many people here.

180
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,080
Rest assured.

181
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,760
Old Lady wishes to change clothes.

182
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,120
Please lead me to see
if the place is clean.

183
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,800
Follow us.

184
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,720
Who are you?

185
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,280
Boss, those people in the backyard
have all been taken down.

186
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,520
When do we act against the women
in the meditation rooms?

187
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,680
Although we are paid to do this job,

188
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,320
one careless move
could lead us into great trouble.

189
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,480
Keep the women and kill all the men.

190
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,960
Only then can we rest easy.

191
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,920
Yes.

192
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,080
You couldn't even

193
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,120
do a small thing well.

194
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,040
I should have killed you at first.

195
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,680
You are annoying.
Scram to the kitchen now.

196
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,200
Think about your masters.

197
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,200
If you dare to mess up my plans again,

198
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,000
I will make you into fertilizer.

199
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,280
Boss, just now, I saw from the back window

200
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,600
that young nun was about
to tip off those women.

201
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,720
That's exactly what I wanted.

202
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,760
It would save me a lot of trouble.

203
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,400
You all are being overcautious.

204
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,920
They've treated us
with warm tea and good food.

205
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,800
Why would they
have the evil intent to harm us?

206
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,160
Each of you is scared as mice.
People would laugh at us if word got out.

207
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,960
I'll go out and call Huijing in

208
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,920
to see what's odd about her.

209
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,000
Mother?

210
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,960
- Mother, are you alright?
- Aunt? Aunt?

211
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,160
Qiongnu?

212
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,520
Old Lady? Old Lady?

213
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,920
It's not the tea. It's the incense.

214
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,760
Qiongnu?

215
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,960
Qiongnu?

216
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,120
Haode…

217
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,360
- Leshan?
- I… I feel a bit dizzy.

218
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
Leshan.

219
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,400
Leshan, you mustn't sleep.

220
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,640
Shush.

221
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,760
Don't make a sound.

222
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,600
Haode. Haode.

223
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,880
This is bad. Someone escaped.
Chase her, quickly.

224
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,000
Haode? Haode? Wake up quickly.

225
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,480
Haode, are you alright?

226
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,720
- Go find help. Hurry up.
- But I…

227
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,280
- Go.
- Okay, wait for me here.

228
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,520
My lord, it's opened.

229
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,520
Help! Help!

230
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,000
Help!

231
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,480
The coffin is riddled with scratch marks,
presenting a shocking sight.

232
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,240
Clearly, someone woke up
inside the coffin,

233
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
desperately struggled, and called for help

234
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,960
before finally running out of strength
and being suffocated to death.

235
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,440
Deng Jingfu,
you entombed a living person in a coffin.

236
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,960
You deserve to die a thousand deaths!

237
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,280
How could this be?

238
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,520
My wife stopped breathing back then.

239
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,440
Mother, you saw it.
Everyone in the Deng family saw it.

240
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,000
How could she come back to life?

241
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,080
Impossible! It's impossible!

242
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,440
Arrest Mrs. Deng and Deng Jingfu.

243
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,840
Order the coroner to examine the body.
We'll set a new trial date.

244
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,000
My lord! We kept her body three days
before burial.

245
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,400
Those who paid condolences
can be our witnesses, my lord.

246
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,400
She was already dead back then, my lord.

247
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,680
- My lord, we are innocent!
- Take them away.

248
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,360
- My lord, we are innocent!
- My lord!

249
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,680
- We are innocent!
- My lord!

250
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,360
- We are innocent!
- My lord!

251
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,280
My daughter!

252
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,880
Your death is so unjust.

253
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,720
And you can't rest in peace even in death.

254
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,280
- My lord.
- My poor daughter.

255
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,800
I never expected that someone
would be entombed alive.

256
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,080
- The Deng family is so cruel.
- Ah Tao.

257
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,280
Did she faint during childbirth

258
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,920
and was mistakenly sealed in the coffin?

259
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,680
Or was it an intentional murder?

260
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,360
A conclusion cannot be drawn yet.

261
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,000
If it's the latter,
I will surely find out the truth

262
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,320
and not let the real culprit
go unpunished.

263
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,280
She ran from the back door. After her!

264
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
- Yes!
- Yes!

265
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,320
Move.

266
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,120
When putting on an act,
you must go all the way.

267
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,120
You know what to do now, right?

268
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

269
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,120
Go ahead.

270
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

271
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,320
Let's go.

272
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,960
It's not bad today.

273
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,520
What did you hunt?

274
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,040
This? A pheasant?

275
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,160
We can find more game over there.
In that area.

276
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,120
- Look at these.
- Your arrows are not bad.

277
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,240
Help! Help! Please help!

278
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,520
Please help!

279
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,000
Young master, please help!

280
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,440
Who are you?

281
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,680
Why are you wandering alone
in the wilderness?

282
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,240
I'm the fifth daughter of the Li family
on Pan Restaurant Street.

283
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,600
I came to Yanyue Hermitage
with my sisters to offer incense.

284
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,160
But the nunnery has been taken over
by a group of bandits.

285
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,840
I must report this to Kaifeng Court.
Young master, please help me.

286
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,720
So, you're someone from the Li family
that runs Sifu House.

287
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,600
Li Leshan, do you still recognize me?

288
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,720
Back then, out of kindness, I offered
to take Li Kangning as my concubine,

289
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,080
but your family filed a complaint
against me to His Majesty.

290
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,960
I was rebuked by His Majesty
and grounded for half a year.

291
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,600
Now look at us,
old enemies on a narrow path.

292
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,600
What day is today?

293
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,680
Yang Xian, you scoundrel!

294
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,880
You'd better pray
that you don't fall into my hands.

295
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,440
Or when that day comes, I'll skin you,

296
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,960
boil you alive,
and crush your bones to dust.

297
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,760
No wonder people say the six Li tigresses
do not adhere to women's virtues.

298
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,720
Indeed, you are fierce. It's a reflection
of your family teachings, I guess.

299
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,960
You…

300
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,360
She fell.

301
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,280
Considering you are a woman,
I won't make things difficult for you.

302
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,800
As long as you kneel and beg for mercy,
swearing to be my maid for three years,

303
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,160
to take off my boots, grind my ink,
and attend to my bed,

304
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,800
I will save your sister.

305
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,960
How about it?

306
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,480
<i>You can be smug now.</i>
<i>Sooner or later, I'll fry you in oil</i>

307
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,440
<i>to a pulp!</i>

308
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:51,240
Young Master Yang,
I beg you to save my sister.

309
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,360
I'm willing to be a slave, a maid,
or anything.

310
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,360
My fourth brother-in-law
is the chief officer of Kaifeng Court.

311
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,840
If you save them, the Shen family
will repay you handsomely in the future.

312
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,160
She agreed to do that?

313
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,760
The Shen family? Which Shen family?

314
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,760
Young lady, how about I save your sister,
and you serve me for three years too?

315
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,840
How is that?

316
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,160
Right, I will also go to save your sister.

317
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,600
You might as well consider me too.

318
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,440
- Exactly.
- It would be better to serve me instead.

319
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,400
- That's right.
- Count me in.

320
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,840
- She's angry.
- Look at her.

321
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,720
- Serve me first.
- Exactly.

322
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,480
- Give it a rest.
- Enough.

323
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,760
- You're making her angry.
- Haha.

324
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,720
You can obediently follow me…

325
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,280
Which Shen family did you mention?

326
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,560
There's only one chief officer in Kaifeng.
Which other Shen family could it be?

327
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,440
Old Lady and other ladies
have all been trapped in the bandits' den.

328
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,760
Get up.

329
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,200
Hold on tight. If you fall,
I won't turn back to save you.

330
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,560
You two go to Kaifeng Court to report.
The rest, follow me.

331
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,520
Yes.

332
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,360
You're leaving, Young Master Yang?

333
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,560
What should we do?

334
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,960
Are you just leaving like that?

335
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,160
Young Master Yang?

336
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,680
Young lady, didn't you come
to pray for a child?

337
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,880
I am here to present a child to you.

338
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,480
Who are you?

339
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,880
With my skill
of disguising a man as a woman,

340
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,240
I disguised myself in the form of a woman.

341
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,800
I have traveled through various places
and tainted many women.

342
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,240
Few have seen through me.

343
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,120
The abbess of Yanyue Hermitage
kindly took me in,

344
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,880
a lonely and helpless woman.

345
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,040
But I let the bandits in at midnight
and occupied her nunnery.

346
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,760
Stop hopping.

347
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,360
Are you hoping that your husband
will come to your rescue?

348
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,680
I'm actually afraid that he won't come.

349
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,200
Yanyue Hermitage is a trap?

350
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,480
Who exactly are you people?

351
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,720
Why do you want to harm my husband?

352
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,360
This question is not for you to ask.

353
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,800
In the dead of night,
we will burn this place down.

354
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,560
If you don't wish to have your body
exposed in the wilderness,

355
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,480
you'll have no choice
but to comply with me.

356
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,240
You rape and kill women.

357
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,760
If I comply with you,
I'm sure I will only face death.

358
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,880
I might as well die

359
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,360
rather than be defiled by you.

360
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,920
Young lady, if you comply with me,

361
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,200
how could I bear to kill you?

362
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,920
Even if my life is spared,

363
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,160
the pain will be unbearable.

364
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,440
That's right, young lady.

365
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,520
Come on.

366
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,360
Young lady, I will be very gentle.

367
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,560
You wretch! How dare you hurt me?

368
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,000
Wretch! You wretch!

369
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,520
Haode. Haode.

370
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,680
It's okay now. It's okay.

371
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,520
Yanyue Hermitage is a trap.
There are ambushes on the road.

372
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,600
They want to kill my husband.
They want to kill him.

373
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,000
Li Leshan, don't forget the oath you made.

374
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,200
I will ask you to fulfill it.

375
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,600
- Haode.
- It's okay.

376
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,800
I'm fine.

377
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,400
I am the lady of the Shen family.
I must not panic.

378
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,400
Right, we must first rescue Old Lady.

379
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,600
Haode.

380
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,360
Guiniang? Guiniang? Wake up quickly.

381
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,000
Guiniang? Guiniang? Guiniang?

382
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,080
No. Someone has broken in!

383
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,720
Mother, you're awake. Are you alright?

384
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,320
Kill everyone inside.

385
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,960
Avenge our brothers.

386
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,120
Don't come over.

387
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,720
Don't come over. Don't!

388
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,640
Haode?

389
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,960
Old Lady. Old Lady.

390
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
It's alright now.

391
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,160
It's alright now.

392
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,240
Qiongnu, wake up quickly. Qiongnu?

393
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,840
Qiongnu.

394
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,960
Leshan?

395
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,000
Yes, I'm here.

396
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,920
Lord Shen, something happened
to your family at Yanyue Hermitage.

397
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,520
Protect the lord.

398
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,920
My lord!

399
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,680
My lord? My lord, are you alright?

400
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,560
My lord?

401
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,160
We were attacked in the outskirts.

402
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,720
Those attackers
were all well-trained assassins.

403
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,760
Each of them struck with lethal force.

404
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,120
They targeted Lord Shen's life.

405
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,920
Fortunately, Young Master Yang
led people to intervene.

406
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,720
Seeing their failure,
the assassins hastily retreated.

407
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,520
Sorry. I failed to prevent the lord
from being injured.

408
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,760
They set a trap at Yanyue Hermitage

409
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,240
to lure Huizhao
out of the city to rescue his family.

410
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,040
They came prepared.
It was hard to guard against them.

411
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,960
Young Master Yang,
thank you for your help.

412
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,200
I'll personally visit
to express my gratitude another day.

413
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,000
You are welcome, sir.

414
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,520
When my grandmother was alive,
she got along well with Old Lady.

415
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,480
With Old Lady in danger,
I'd definitely not stand by.

416
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,240
Luckily, I brought many guards to hunt,
allowing us to save Old Lady.

417
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,560
But, sadly, even doubling back
to warn Lord Shen

418
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,800
was already a step too late.

419
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,160
I'm overwhelmed with shame
and dare not accept your thanks.

420
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,880
This is not the place to talk.
Let's speak in the parlor.

421
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,760
Mr. Qiao, your injury is severe.
You'd better have it treated now.

422
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,440
Yes.

423
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,800
Please.

424
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,560
Old Lady just took

425
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,400
some sedative decoction and fell asleep.

426
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,800
Haode, you haven't eaten or drunk
since we came back.

427
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,920
Have some porridge, okay?

428
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,920
<i>Brother, do you know?</i>

429
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,720
<i>I killed a living person.</i>

430
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,760
<i>My hands have been shaking.</i>

431
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,000
<i>Yet, I feel so proud.</i>

432
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,560
<i>Because the person I protected</i>

433
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,760
<i>matters a lot to you.</i>

434
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,680
<i>Wake up quickly.</i>

435
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,120
<i>And praise me, will you?</i>

436
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,200
<i>Just praise me.</i>

437
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,520
<i>Actually, I am very scared.</i>

438
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,040
<i>I'm so scared.</i>

439
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,280
My lord, sorry. I failed the task.

440
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,440
I know all about it.

441
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,360
You are a chivalrous hero
of high integrity.

442
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,560
Having you go undercover at Kaifeng Court
must've been hard for you.

443
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,600
My lord, I was naive
to the ways of the world then.

444
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,840
Full of righteous indignation,
I always stood up for others.

445
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,200
I was envied by my commander.

446
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,400
Even losing my official post
and resigning wouldn't save my life.

447
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,000
I managed to survive
entirely thanks to your lordship's help.

448
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,720
Later on, when I was broke
and unable to afford my mother's funeral,

449
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,240
it was you who helped me
return to my hometown to bury her.

450
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,600
I can hardly repay your kindness
with a thousand deaths.

451
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,040
Yet should you command it,
I wouldn't dare shirk it.

452
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,600
I meant nothing by saying that.
Don't take it to heart.

453
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,160
Get up now.

454
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,400
After this battle,

455
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,480
you have become the most trusted person
by Shen Huizhao's side.

456
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,240
Don't worry. You will find another chance.

457
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,240
My lord, you are magnanimous.

458
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,960
I have asked to be discharged from service
to return to farming.

459
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,680
His Majesty praised me
for putting righteousness before family

460
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,200
and made every effort to retain me.

461
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,120
I still have many days ahead

462
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,240
and can wait for the right opportunity.

463
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,600
One day,

464
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,720
I'll make him utterly discredited
and isolated. When he looks back by then,

465
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,560
I'm afraid he will be filled with regret
for not dying yesterday.

466
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,400
<i>Huizhao, save Yingying.</i>

467
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,200
<i>Brother, help!</i>

468
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,120
<i>You heartless thing!</i>

469
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,280
<i>You don't deserve</i>
<i>to have parents, a wife, or children.</i>

470
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,240
<i>I won't take you as my son anymore.</i>

471
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,480
<i>Although your bridal sedan came to</i>
<i>our family, we're not a real couple.</i>

472
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,920
<i>If one day I am capable enough</i>
<i>to change your mind,</i>

473
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,080
<i>we'll make a great couple.</i>
<i>Let's make a deal for three years.</i>

474
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,600
<i>One year.</i>

475
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,080
<i>By then, I will prepare a dowry for you</i>
<i>and find you an ideal new husband.</i>

476
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,680
Brother?

477
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,400
Brother?

478
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,040
Brother.

479
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,800
Brother.

480
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,680
You're awake.

481
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,680
Brother, you're awake.

482
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,760
It's good that you're awake.

483
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,720
What happened in Yanyue Hermitage
is like a terror of night,

484
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,240
so frightening that my bones chill.

485
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,760
But I managed to survive
and see you again.

486
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,600
Li Haode.

487
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,480
Brother-in-law, y-you remember everything?

488
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,400
He's awake?

489
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,960
Quickly help me up.
I need to go see Huizhao.

490
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,760
Old Lady, rest assured.
The physician has checked him.

491
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,040
Huizhao's injuries are all external.

492
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,760
But you've been frightened.
You must rest well.

493
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,080
Otherwise, if you fall ill,
how can Huizhao be at ease?

494
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,720
It'll be harder for him to recuperate.

495
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,200
But your eyes are red.

496
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,440
You're not deceiving me, are you?

497
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,280
Is Huizhao really fine?

498
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,320
He's perfectly fine.

499
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,840
Old Lady, just rest assured.

500
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,600
I… I'm just too happy.

501
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,400
Haode.

502
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,920
The situation was dire yesterday.

503
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,000
Our lives were hanging by a thread.

504
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,520
Thanks to you. You saved us.

505
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,480
Huizhao marrying you

506
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,280
is truly a great blessing
for my entire family.

507
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,440
Old Lady.

508
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,160
Old Lady, outside…

509
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,680
Outside, a young lady named Fang
has arrived.

510
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,840
She says she has come
to seek refuge as a relative.

511
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,480
Old Lady, Huizhao cannot be left alone.
I'll take my leave.

512
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,360
Okay.

513
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:49,960
Go ahead.

514
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,040
It's Huizhao's

515
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,080
late maternal uncle's daughter,

516
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,080
his blood-related cousin.

517
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,440
She has brought

518
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,400
only an old nanny and a young maid.

519
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,200
The bandit leader at Yanyue Hermitage was
behind dozens of rape-by-fraud cases

520
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,840
in the areas of Shaozhou and Wuzhou.

521
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,320
He was killed by Young Master Yang
with a sword.

522
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,960
The remaining 12 either died or fled.

523
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,480
We captured two of them alive.

524
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,000
Under severe torture, they both claimed
they acted under orders

525
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,640
and didn't know the mastermind.
As for those assassins,

526
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,520
Official Du led his men to search Bianjing

527
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,160
but found no traces of them,
as if they'd vanished into thin air.

528
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,520
Even a passing bird's shadow
can be cast on the ground.

529
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,120
It shows that the mastermind
behind this is not ordinary at all.

530
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,920
Before your injury, you were investigating
the death of the Deng family's wife.

531
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,920
The case file has arrived.

532
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,680
My lady.

533
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,320
My lord, you just woke up.
Yet you're working already.

534
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,560
If your health is damaged,

535
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,720
Old Lady will blame me
for not taking good care of you.

536
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,600
Li Haode, close the door.
I have something to say to you.

537
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,840
Sit over there.

538
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,560
- I'm about to say something seri--
- I know what you want to say.

539
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,240
You will say that the tumble
has brought back your memories,

540
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,080
we're not a fine couple,
and you want to keep your distance, right?

541
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:56,200
Brother, you are in my room
and sitting on my bed.

542
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,800
If you truly have forgotten it,

543
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,280
let me remind you again.

544
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,920
You slept in this bed more than once.

545
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,720
I'm afraid it's too late for you
to say that to me now.

546
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,320
As a woman, you--

547
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,600
You aren't ashamed for being heartless.
Why should I feel ashamed?

548
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,520
The feigned play has long become real.

549
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,320
The position of me as Mrs. Shen
can no longer be revoked.

550
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,560
If you abandon me,
I'll go to the elders for help.

551
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,000
Do you have anything to say?

552
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,560
You and I are not on the same path.
We won't be husband and wife for long.

553
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,360
I care not whether you are willing or not.

554
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,040
Just consider

555
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,280
I'm destined to you,
and you can't get rid of me.

556
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,040
You'll have to bear with it

557
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,200
until you get used to me.

558
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,920
In 20 or 30 years…

559
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,960
we will also count
as growing old together.

560
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,280
Rest well. I still need to talk to Leshan.

561
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,080
<i>Haode,</i>
<i>don't resent me for being heartless.</i>

562
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,240
<i>Keeping your distance from me</i>

563
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,040
<i>is for your own good.</i>

564
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,200
Haode.

565
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,280
Haode.

566
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,920
Now is not the time to cry.

567
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,960
Do you know who that Lady Fang is
and why she visits the Shen family?

568
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,800
She is the fiancée
that Shen Huizhao's mother chose for him.

569
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,520
She is here to force the Shen family
to honor the marriage agreement.

570
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,040
