EPISODE 32

2
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,520
Dad, Leshan has gone mad.
She has simply gone mad.

3
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,160
What a disgrace. What a disgrace!

4
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,840
This shrew is causing trouble again.
Let go of Zhuniang quickly.

5
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,160
If you hit her, I will return the favor.

6
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,760
I won't let you off this time.

7
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,280
Good and evil will eventually be repaid.

8
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,160
Do not rejoice if it arrives late.

9
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,920
But the time has not yet come.

10
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,520
You two,

11
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,120
if you can curb your old ways,

12
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,840
you might be able to cling to life.

13
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,120
If you continue to stir up trouble

14
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,440
and hurt innocent lives,

15
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,720
I will not tolerate this.

16
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,120
Punishing the wicked is exhausting.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,520
Fainting.

18
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,120
- Quick.
- Sister.

19
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,960
- Quick. Didn't you see her fainting?
- Sister.

20
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,480
Quickly carry her back to the room.

21
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,840
Get up quickly, sister.

22
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,480
- Zhuniang, are you alright?
- Sister.

23
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,360
Help her up.

24
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,320
My lady.

25
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,600
Gently.

26
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,680
- Be careful.
- Here.

27
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,000
- Come.
- Son.

28
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,240
Come on.

29
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,760
Could she be possessed?

30
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,960
Mother, now is not the time
to ask questions.

31
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,720
Saving her is urgent.
Summon the physician.

32
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,400
Quick, go.

33
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,920
- Sir.
- What?

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,120
They're beating to kill.

35
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,160
What…

36
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,520
What on earth is going on here?

37
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,400
My lord,
a possessed person is no trivial matter.

38
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,440
When it strikes,
one doesn't even recognize family.

39
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,760
It strikes at anyone on sight.

40
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,920
With all her energy exhausted,
she momentarily fainted.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,760
What will she be like
once she wakes up again?

42
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,120
That's still hard to say.

43
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,960
Should we tie her up first?

44
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,120
My lord, we called

45
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,920
- physician Wang for a consultation.
- No need.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,840
Haven't we prepared
the demon-repelling blood?

47
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,720
Bring a bowl of it.

48
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,320
Yes.

49
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,600
I'm certainly not drinking that blood.

50
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,320
You're tricking me.

51
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,280
Aren't you possessed?

52
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,840
Where in this world
are there ghosts and evil spirits?

53
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,960
I'm afraid the most evil thing
is the human heart.

54
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,480
I thought

55
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,400
you were going
to beat up my parents as well.

56
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,240
I'm pretending
to be crazy to punish the evil.

57
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,960
But why beat the elderly without a reason?

58
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,720
My mother said

59
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,920
robbing the rich to help the poor,
that's called a knight-errant.

60
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,600
Bullying the weak, that's called a tyrant.

61
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,680
I'm defiant and fierce,

62
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,520
but also renowned and upright.

63
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,920
Your sister-in-law's hurt people.
Otherwise, why would I beat them?

64
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,880
Tonight is but a minor punishment
for a major admonition.

65
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,560
Once I seize ironclad evidence of murder,

66
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,840
I'll send it
to the Kaifeng Court for prosecution.

67
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,200
By then, you won't be able to stop it.

68
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,400
My second sister
is the most acerbic and narrow-minded.

69
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,400
Having been beaten, would she let you off?

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,640
Meet force with force. When water comes,
pile on dirt to keep it out.

71
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,640
There's nothing wrong,
yet you still cling to my bed.

72
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,800
What, you can't bear to leave?

73
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,480
You wish.

74
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,520
Just wait.

75
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,280
When my sister gets up tomorrow,

76
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,440
she'll definitely incite Mother
to teach you a lesson.

77
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,800
How dare she
openly beat her sister-in-law?

78
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,400
Causing such a commotion

79
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,840
and still have the face
to run back to her parents' house.

80
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,760
You go pull her down for me.

81
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,560
I'll give her a couple of slaps
to see if she dares to fight back.

82
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,720
Please calm your anger. It's taboo
to scold a daughter-in-law in public.

83
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,160
You don't want to be gossiped about,
or lose your dignity.

84
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,880
We can only persuade her
with kind words to turn back.

85
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,920
Once the family door is shut,
act as one pleases.

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,320
Not afraid that she'll fly
out of the palm of your hand.

87
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,280
You go.

88
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,120
Just say that I have a couple
of important words to entrust.

89
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,480
Ask her to come down nicely.

90
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,720
Her domineering spirit

91
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,520
is truly rare in the world.

92
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,120
We servants are likely unable
to dissuade her.

93
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,240
Timid as a mouse.

94
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,400
I will go myself.

95
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,840
I'd like to see her try to shirk.

96
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,800
- Li Leshan.
- Go.

97
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,440
Stop.

98
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,680
Where are we going?

99
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,160
Quick, call someone to chase!

100
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,560
I am your mother-in-law.

101
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,040
If you dare to act rashly, family rules
and moral norms won't spare you.

102
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,080
Mother-in-law, don't be afraid.

103
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,840
Although I'm from a humble family,
I know the hierarchical order.

104
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,280
I rashly schemed to have you come here.

105
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,520
I have my own reasons.

106
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,440
Once you arrive at the place
you will understand everything.

107
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,840
What kind of place is this?

108
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,320
So cramped and narrow.

109
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,000
The smell of horse urine
and cow dung is everywhere.

110
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,200
The carriage almost stalled.

111
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,440
What do you want me to see?

112
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,840
And we've been waiting so long.

113
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,680
It's here.

114
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,360
Indeed, one corpse and two lives.
The evidence is irrefutable.

115
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,760
They should take the corpse
to the court for confirmation.

116
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,880
Only then can they console
the soul of the daughter.

117
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,520
Imagine if it were commoners

118
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,320
without wealth or power, they wouldn't
dare to report to the officials.

119
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,560
This is quite strange, indeed.

120
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,160
The Zhang family, without wealth or power,
dare confront the Yangs for wrongdoing.

121
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,640
Leaving Yinping's corpse,

122
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,240
isn't it just the right way
to ask for more funeral expenses?

123
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,480
Why a midnight burial?

124
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,120
Unless she took someone else's money

125
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,000
and intentionally framed Yang…

126
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,720
my husband.

127
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,000
They also fear that the authorities will
investigate and the truth will be exposed.

128
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,240
That's why it was secret.

129
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,800
YANG MANSION

130
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,560
Slow down.

131
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,880
- Careful.
- Ah!

132
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,200
Li Leshan, you dare to come back.

133
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,440
We've searched all over Bianjing
and also inquired at Sifu House.

134
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,760
Where have you hidden my mother?

135
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,240
If you don't tell the truth,

136
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,360
don't blame me
for taking it to your Li family.

137
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,360
You are really muddled in your actions.

138
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,800
My mother is your mother-in-law.

139
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,400
A transgression
to a superior is an offense.

140
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,200
Upon investigation, no one
in your Li family can escape involvement.

141
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,040
Hurry up and explain.

142
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,800
It will also save us
from a major conflict.

143
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,760
Mother-in-law, please step out.

144
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,560
Mother.

145
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,920
Mother, you…

146
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,520
It's too stuffy inside the house.

147
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,720
I asked my daughter-in-law
to accompany me for a walk.

148
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,720
Don't make a fuss over it.

149
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,600
Disperse now.

150
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,720
Mother, I have been worried
about you all day.

151
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,040
Mother.

152
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,120
Li Leshan.

153
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,920
What kind of spell
did you cast on my mother?

154
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,880
My lord's injuries haven't healed.
I must return to attend to him.

155
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,280
I must take my leave first.

156
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,920
What exactly has Li Leshan done?

157
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,160
She's charmed Mother so much
her speech has changed.

158
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,080
I've really underestimated her.

159
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,880
This demoness.
She's brewed a potent enchantment potion.

160
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,520
Even Mother has been deceived by her.

161
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,480
- Quick, it's killing me.
- Come on.

162
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,040
Quickly help me back.

163
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,320
- It's Li Leshan's fault.
- Ouch.

164
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,560
Slow down.

165
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,320
My mother really believed your words?

166
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,480
Of course.

167
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,360
Seeing is believing. How could she not?

168
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,920
Ever since I came of age,

169
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,840
I've only seen her bickering
with the concubines every day.

170
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,400
Competing over prestige,
dignity, and sons,

171
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,080
as if there's nothing else worth doing.

172
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm her underachieving son.

173
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,680
Can't bring her any honor.

174
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,600
Instead, I cause discord
between the parents.

175
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,440
Though she defends me verbally,
in her heart, resentment is inevitable.

176
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,520
And others add fuel
to the fire with their words,

177
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,120
as if all the evils
of the world are my doing.

178
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,240
That's because
of your unyielding and unruly nature.

179
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,640
Your actions give others
the opportunity to falsely accuse you.

180
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,120
But that's my own business.
No need for you to meddle.

181
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,360
I've arranged for men
to lie in ambush at the cemetery.

182
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,400
I've discussed it
with your mother already.

183
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,960
Should we capture Zhang's family
and hand them to the authorities

184
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,040
to charge them
with the crime of extortion?

185
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,600
Guess what your mother said?

186
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,080
I really don't want to know.

187
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,520
She said, "Tomorrow, deliver a generous
gift to the Zhang family to appease them.

188
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,440
Give Yinping a proper burial
and put the matter to rest."

189
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,120
Turning someone in to the authorities
would certainly be satisfying.

190
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,720
But it's inevitable
that others will still criticize you

191
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,480
for coercing a servant girl

192
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,880
and for driving her to her death.

193
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,840
Although your mother is misled,
she does truly care about you.

194
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,200
She's not doing it for me.

195
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,520
She's afraid of people saying
the Yangs abuse their power

196
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,760
and oppresses the common folk.

197
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,200
Li Leshan,

198
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,400
you've been pulling effort
and carefully planning for me.

199
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,480
You couldn't possibly
have changed your mind,

200
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,480
intending to stay
and become my wife, right?

201
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,640
What are you trying to do?

202
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,880
Leshan,

203
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,400
you've worked hard to exonerate Xian.

204
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,000
What do you want?

205
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,840
My mother often says since ancient times,
families who rise through meanness

206
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,600
never enjoy lasting wealth and honor.

207
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,520
When children and grandchildren
are rebellious,

208
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,160
they'll reap what they sowed.

209
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,280
Now that I'm married into the Yang family,

210
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,600
firstly, I want harmony
throughout the Yang family

211
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,840
and a legacy of integrity.

212
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,640
Secondly, I want my husband
to have a change of heart and start anew

213
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,840
to become a better person.

214
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,400
Changing his stubborn nature?
You're dreaming.

215
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,200
If he could change,
not to mention tolerating you a little,

216
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,040
I'd even set up an ancestral tablet
for you to ensure your long life

217
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,360
and willingly burn incense
three times a day for you.

218
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,400
Once in my hands,

219
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,440
let alone flesh and blood,

220
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,200
even the straight and strong poplars,

221
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,840
if I say bend, they will bend.
They will do whatever I say.

222
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,800
However,

223
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,840
I still have to ask you for something.

224
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,160
Without it, I can't deal with him.

225
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,160
What thing?

226
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,480
I want the power to lead the Yang family.

227
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,400
I want that Gold Master Seal
in your hands.

228
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,760
From today on,

229
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,280
without the gold seal in my hand,

230
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,600
even if you have
tens of thousands in wealth,

231
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,920
you won't be able to get a coin
from the accounting house.

232
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,640
Yet more ragged
than the beggars at the street corner.

233
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,920
Li Leshan, you've got quite the nerve.

234
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,120
What?

235
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
My lord.

236
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,680
Leave.

237
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,920
Can't order you around anymore? Get out.

238
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,320
Have someone else come in.

239
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,560
Why are you scolding him?

240
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,280
You're eating less, looking all gloomy.

241
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,280
And the bone injury
is taking so long to heal.

242
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,560
We rely on him for everything.

243
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,600
It's rash to replace him
with someone else.

244
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,320
Where can we find someone
as handy as him?

245
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,320
In that case, have the accountant
lift the ban, and I'll take my medicine.

246
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,440
- Just put it there.
- Yes.

247
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,560
My lord, time for your medicine.

248
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,880
- Just…
- Take the medicine.

249
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,000
It suits both of us.

250
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,080
Wait until I'm fully recovered,

251
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,280
- then we'll settle accounts.
- All right, all right.

252
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,880
Once your legs are better,

253
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,000
you'll feel the force
of my gold pod again.

254
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,160
I'd rather die than drink it.

255
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,160
- Drink or not?
- I won't drink.

256
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,240
My lord.

257
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,160
My lord, my lady,
the Li family has sent someone.

258
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,880
- Have them come in quickly.
- Yes.

259
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,200
- Madam, my wife is bullying--
- Shut up.

260
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,240
Cutting off the source of your
financial disaster is for your own good.

261
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,480
Madam.

262
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,480
You're driving me crazy.

263
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,960
Shut up, no talking.

264
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,600
You may not speak.

265
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,880
How come it's you?

266
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,880
It seems we have come
at an inconvenient time.

267
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,680
Mother knows the fifth brother-in-law
loves her candied meat buns.

268
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,840
She rendered the lard
in the third watch of the night.

269
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,360
These two baskets are freshly steamed,
fragrant and sweet.

270
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,400
She wanted to deliver them personally,
but really couldn't leave the shop.

271
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,160
She also insisted I bring some
winter melons and eggplants

272
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,560
from the Chai family homestead.

273
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,880
I said the Yang family is very wealthy.
There's nothing good they haven't seen.

274
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,760
She said those are fresh crops
from the field.

275
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,760
Even the palace
can't get such fresh produce.

276
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,800
By the way,

277
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,240
she let me check on you

278
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,840
to see if you are bullying
your husband again.

279
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,040
Yes, yes, yes.

280
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,360
No, no, no.

281
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,320
Just kidding.

282
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,800
It's nice Madam thinks of me,
and I have her on my mind too.

283
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,560
The crab roe buns
made by our chef taste extremely good.

284
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,160
It's famous in Bianjing.

285
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,200
I had him make several more boxes to share
with my mother-in-law and sisters.

286
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,040
A friend of mine will also bring some
fresh cherries and golden apricots.

287
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,840
If you don't mind,
stay here a couple more days

288
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,400
- and take them all back for me.
- No, that won't do.

289
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,080
Qiongnu,

290
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,320
the shop can't do without you
even for a moment.

291
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,480
But when coming here, Mom said

292
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,360
the Yang family
has a big and beautiful garden

293
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,800
filled with all sorts
of exotic flowers and plants.

294
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,440
She asked you to show me around properly.

295
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,880
There's no rush to go back.

296
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,920
<i>What's there to admire in the garden?</i>

297
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,240
<i>It's because she's afraid I'll bully</i>
<i>Yang Xian, sending you to watch me.</i>

298
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,880
<i>Good that you are aware of it.</i>

299
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,840
Still annoyed?

300
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,560
I have something serious to tell you.

301
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,480
Leave us.

302
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,680
Mom asked me to pass on a message.

303
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,440
It was his fault at the beginning.

304
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
No wonder you resent him.

305
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,280
But now that the bridal palanquin
has entered the Yang family's gate,

306
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,280
everyone acknowledges you two
as husband and wife.

307
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,520
Like nails hammered into stone,

308
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,280
it can never be changed again.

309
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,720
This incessant arguing,

310
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,280
is it pleasing to the eye or to the ear?
Don't give others something to talk about.

311
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,520
Did I snatch a bridal palanquin,
forcibly took someone's wife,

312
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,520
or act lawlessly?

313
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,640
Act upright, sit straight.

314
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,400
Being fair to the heavens.
I'm not afraid of being talked about.

315
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,200
Disobedient.

316
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,800
Beating the husband, scolding
the sisters-in-law, just name it.

317
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,360
Behind our backs, people curse Mother.

318
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,960
They will blame Mom
for not teaching her daughter well,

319
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,400
allowing a domineering daughter.

320
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm begging you.

321
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,680
For the sake of our mother
and the reputation of the Li family,

322
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,440
be nicer to your husband.

323
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,360
When I see him, it reminds me of the
forced marriage and kidnapping incident.

324
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,760
I'm so angry I could hit him.

325
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,080
You may not be fond of him,
but he sure fancies you.

326
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,320
You hated him and got physical.

327
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,160
Did he fight back, for even a little?

328
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,520
If you don't believe me,
just try showing him some kindness once.

329
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,840
It would make him overjoyed.

330
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,920
Alright, alright.

331
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,400
Forget about it. The boring talks
make me impatient.

332
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,760
Don't you just love pearls?

333
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,400
I've just acquired a new pearl crown.

334
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,240
It was a gift from Lady Jieyu
from the palace.

335
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,280
I'll have someone bring it.
Let's both admire it.

336
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,600
You sure are stubborn.

337
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,280
Here, eat this.

338
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,520
Leshan.

339
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,000
So, your leg healed a while ago

340
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,720
and yet you dared
to sneak out for hunting.

341
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,960
It seems you've been
hiding some personal savings.

342
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,120
That doesn't give you the right
to plot against your husband.

343
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,800
I just checked the ledger yesterday.

344
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,040
You, Master Yang,
live a life of luxury and wealth.

345
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,040
All your expenses go to hosting banquets,
frolicking, and hunting.

346
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,440
You spend thousands of gold
in a single month.

347
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,720
Only to entertain a few worthless fellows.

348
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,240
Even dogs are more loyal
than those few scoundrels and cronies.

349
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,080
I saw through it long ago.

350
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,120
Yang Xian, you are no fool.

351
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,680
Indulging in pleasures,
you've given up on yourself.

352
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,600
In this family,
who actually cares about you?

353
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,600
You…

354
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,840
There is no one in the Yang family
that I care about.

355
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,920
Who am I supposed to impress?

356
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,240
Unless my lady takes pity
and agrees to be my true wife.

357
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,360
Someday, I will earn
a noble title for my lady.

358
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,600
And that would only be right.

359
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,440
I never expected that in my lord's heart,

360
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,640
I would hold such a position.

361
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,600
My lady is willing to help me
to this extent.

362
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,920
Such great kindness.

363
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,280
I should certainly return the favor.

364
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,800
At my lady's service.

365
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
If you want me to be your wife,

366
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,720
have you exchanged betrothal gifts
or set a wedding date?

367
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,720
The Yang family hasn't offered a bride
price nor completed any formalities.

368
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,600
You haven't offered incense
at the temple.

369
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,440
Without a proper name and declaration,
how do you claim to be married?

370
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,360
I have an imperial gold plaque,
a match made in heaven.

371
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,840
- You.
- Beat as you will.

372
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,960
Rascal.

373
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,520
Luckily, I was prepared in advance.

374
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,880
Even when Mr. Du
seeks to marry my eldest sister,

375
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,520
he must first pass the three challenges.

376
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,280
This is my family's tradition.

377
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,600
I'm afraid that even if
I pass 30 challenges,

378
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,440
someone will still turn their back on me.

379
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,400
You really want to ask
for my hand in marriage?

380
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,520
My third sister
once asked her husband to swear,

381
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,520
if the wife has a short life and the
couple is forever separated by death,

382
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,760
the husband must mourn for three years
before he may remarry.

383
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,520
I'm more overbearing than my sisters.

384
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,680
If I die first,

385
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,480
I'll take
my husband's possessions with me.

386
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,600
Even if it means burning them to ashes,

387
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,560
I will not share
a single penny with others.

388
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,120
If you are dead and buried in the evening,
I'll bury myself at midnight to follow.

389
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,000
Once a promise is made,
it's unbreakable as stone.

390
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,280
We'll clap hands as an oath
and never go back on our words.

391
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,960
Good. I swear by the moon,

392
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,160
if you truly can pass
the three challenges,

393
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,200
then I am willing to commit
my entire life to you.

394
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,920
If I break the promise
and the oath, punish me

395
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,360
to be abandoned by everyone,
as a lifelong widow.

396
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,200
I don't trust you unless

397
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,080
you sleep in my bed.

398
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,400
The couple sleeps on separate beds.

399
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,760
Mother will ask and the servants gossip.

400
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,400
It wouldn't be good if Mother-in-law
knows it.

401
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,320
Without passing the three challenges,
we are not husband and wife yet.

402
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,080
We'll live with borders, like Chu and Han.

403
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,680
Dare encroach the slightest bit,
and you shall be dead.

404
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,600
Go to sleep.

405
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,760
My lady.

406
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,640
My lady,
where are you going so late at night?

407
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,920
To admire the moon.

408
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,840
<i>He is putting on an act everywhere,</i>

409
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,320
<i>seeking to win my pity.</i>

410
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,160
<i>I shouldn't agree</i>
<i>to these three challenges.</i>

411
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,440
<i>What if he…</i>

412
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,360
<i>Do I really have to marry him?</i>

413
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,400
- Don't worry.
- You are of no use.

414
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,560
When will we finally
get rid of that calamity?

415
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,600
Who's there?

416
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,440
My lady.

417
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,200
My lady, slow down.

418
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,280
I'll just go get a lantern.

419
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,520
My lady, you walk too fast.

420
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,200
This…

421
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,840
I don't know who this shameless one is,
tarnishing my lady's discerning eyes.

422
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,440
Tomorrow, I'll report to the mistress.

423
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,640
The golden crow accompanies
the laurels of the moon.

424
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
The sun and the moon vie for radiance.

425
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
What great ambition and spirit.

426
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,840
This embroidery pattern is rare.

427
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,240
The needlework skill is also uncommon.

428
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,680
Don't act rashly and alert the enemy.
Keep it well.

429
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,600
Yes.

430
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,360
<i>Things will eventually</i>
<i>sort themselves out.</i>

431
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,800
<i>What's there to worry about?</i>

432
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,440
<i>Set the exam questions</i>
<i>to be extremely difficult.</i>

433
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,320
<i>Let him know it's difficult and withdraw.</i>

434
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,760
Lion dance?

435
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,600
Before the dragon boat race each year,

436
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,560
there's always a lion dance contest
for the top prize.

437
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,920
For the winner, the emperor
grant positions and bestows gold.

438
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,080
It's truly a splendid sight.

439
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,600
If you win first place,
then you've passed the first challenge.

440
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,640
Lion dance to grab the prize? It can't be.

441
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,400
It's true.

442
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,080
Your good brother
is recruiting capable people,

443
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,600
eager to win in the Lion King contest.

444
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,840
It must be that shrew instigating trouble.

445
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,080
Mom has become indifferent recently

446
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,400
and neglected everything.

447
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,320
I heard that shrew
took over Mom's Gold Master Seal

448
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,040
and wants to thoroughly check
the account books of these past years.

449
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,560
What if she discovers your doings
these few years?

450
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,760
What should we do?

451
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,200
Rest assured. The accounts I've done,

452
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,000
ordinary people can't spot anything amiss.

453
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,680
Let alone every Dragon Boat Festival,

454
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,280
Jinming Pool attracts experts.

455
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,520
Dangers lurk everywhere.

456
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,920
Picking the top prize isn't easy.

457
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,400
Even if a few people die,

458
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,600
it's not surprising.

459
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,880
No way. After all, he is my own brother.

460
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,560
Even if I dislike him,

461
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,520
I'll just find a way to drive him out.

462
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,160
Taking lives over money matters

463
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,640
is unacceptable.

464
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,520
Where is your mind going?

465
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,640
It's just to teach him a lesson or two

466
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,680
to dispel your resentment.

467
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,920
Make them obedient in the future.

468
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,520
Also let the couple

469
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,360
learn their lessons.

470
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,280
It's not yet their turn
to be in charge of the Yang family.

471
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,800
Good plan.

472
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,800
Also, a good way to deal with that shrew.

473
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,920
Intimidate and subdue her.

474
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,400
My good wife.

475
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,200
You're really smart.

476
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,040
Stand firm.

477
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,120
Be careful.

478
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,320
My lord, be careful.

479
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,360
That prize is hung high. It's nothing like
the lion dance on the ground.

480
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,080
Make sure you stay stable.

481
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,240
If one falls from a high place,
at least it will cause fractures.

482
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,320
At worst, it could be life-threatening.

483
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,840
Be extremely careful.

484
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,760
When my grandfather was alive,

485
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,840
I performed a lion dance for his birthday.

486
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,680
I must lack practice.

487
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,480
- Again.
- Come on.

488
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,240
Brother Yang.

489
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,360
I've just returned

490
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,080
and I hear you're risking your life here.

491
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,680
Don't make everyone worried.

492
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,080
They say that Li Leshan is fierce
like a tiger and cruel like a wolf.

493
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,880
Cold-hearted and malicious,
a match for a demon.

494
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,040
What has bewitched your senses?

495
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,160
Not to mention
she plays you around every day.

496
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,640
You still treat her like a treasure.

497
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,400
For such a violent woman,

498
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,240
it's not worth risking your life.

499
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,320
- Let's continue.
- Okay.

500
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,040
She is probably fooling you around
and will not truly keep her word.

501
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,760
When the Dragon Boat Festival comes,

502
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,200
all the people in Bianjing
will come to watch the contest.

503
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,360
Surrounded by such a crowd,

504
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,920
if you really lose,
it will be a great embarrassment.

505
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,480
Yang, slow down.

506
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,840
Aren't you afraid of heights?

507
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,080
Dare slander Leshan again,

508
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,120
I'll crush your tongue.

509
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,600
- Continue.
- Slow down.

510
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,280
Qiansheng,
why don't you try to persuade him?

511
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,440
Enough said.

512
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,600
He's gone mad, truly mad.

513
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,440
Slow down.

514
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,280
Be careful.

515
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,840
Sort out this mugwort carefully.

516
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,000
My lady.

517
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,600
It's almost dusk.

518
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,520
Your husband has not returned home yet.

519
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,800
Yes.

520
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,360
Why are you looking at me?

521
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,880
My lady.

522
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,720
The Lord is in fear of heights
from childhood.

523
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,640
I'm afraid he is not suited
for the contest.

524
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,200
- Take it to him.
- Yes.

525
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,080
These are the corn dumplings
my mother made.

526
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,880
Do not mention me in this.

527
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,520
Nor are you allowed to look at me.

528
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,480
Try the perilla drink I brewed at home.
Sir, please have a taste.

529
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,200
Fresh pastries on sale.

530
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,080
My lady, the iced beverage I've brewed.

531
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,280
Would you like to try?

532
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,440
They're all very tasty.

533
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,760
- Come and have a taste.
- Don't be in a hurry.

534
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,280
- Come, come.
- Why is it built so high?

535
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,440
Too overconfident.

536
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,440
Absolutely not.

537
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,520
What is this?

538
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,680
He is just a porcelain vase.

539
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,920
- Just for show.
- Exactly.

540
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,480
How could he possibly win?

541
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,280
Look at my foolish brother.

542
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,640
Always causing trouble

543
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,160
on normal days.

544
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,960
There are no outsiders here today.

545
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,400
There's nothing that can't be said.

546
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,760
I have no idea

547
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,760
who incited him,

548
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,200
making a fuss about
joining the Lion King Festival.

549
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,440
And he's making a big show of it,

550
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,480
making it known
to everyone with his clamor.

551
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,600
Over these years,

552
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,320
those who have won the prize
are all brave warriors.

553
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,280
It's not his turn at all.

554
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,280
Just look.

555
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,720
They've all come to witness
the joke of our Yang family.

556
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,680
No wonder Father hasn't come.

557
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,000
It would embarrass me to death.

558
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,840
Can't believe they're a family.

559
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,160
When the brother is in the arena,

560
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,840
they don't cheer for him,

561
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,640
but they discourage and mock.

562
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,920
Is she really his sister?

563
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,680
Poor man.

564
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,400
Look, someone from the palace
has come too.

565
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,160
GENEROUS AND KIND

566
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,080
Yesterday, Uncle specially
visited my second cousin,

567
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,320
earnestly advising him not to go.

568
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,960
Turns out it's because
His Majesty came in person.

569
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,080
Alright, now, we will

570
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,040
embarrass ourselves
in front of the royal family.

571
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,120
My presumptuous dear brother.

572
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,360
If this turns out to be a complete defeat,

573
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,520
on the face of Jieyu,

574
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,680
there will be no glory.

575
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,360
That's enough.

576
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,640
Nobody is allowed
to speak dishearteningly.

577
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,040
What's the matter with you?

578
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,960
It's no good.

579
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,920
- What's happened?
- I have a stomachache.

580
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,560
Stomachache.

581
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,080
Such a critical moment.
How did you end up with a bad stomach?

582
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,680
Right, if you leave, what do we do?

583
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,200
Even if it's the last thing you do,
you have to hold on for me.

584
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,920
Otherwise, at this time, where will I find
a drummer in such a hurry?

585
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
The lion dance contest needs a drummer.
The momentum can't be weak.

586
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,760
Yeah, if you leave, who will cheer for us?

587
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,200
Can't do it.

588
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,840
It's not going to work.

589
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,560
What can we do about this?

590
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,240
This…

591
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,120
What should we do?

592
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,120
It's already this late.
Where are you going?

593
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,120
Xian.

594
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,000
Follow me.

595
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,680
Xian, that pole is high.

596
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,840
It makes my heart tremble.

597
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,880
You can't go.

598
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,040
Go and see what's going on.

599
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,000
What? Let me do it?

600
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,080
What's wrong?

601
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,000
You wield your staff with divine skill.

602
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,720
Are you scared to switch to drumsticks?

603
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,080
Why wouldn't I dare?

604
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,080
It's just that…

605
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,960
Showing off in front of a big crowd,
it's not proper for a lady.

606
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,000
The Yang family
will have trouble with you again.

607
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,680
Xian, not just anyone
can replace the drummer.

608
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,360
Stop causing a scene
and being a laughingstock.

609
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,680
Let's go.

610
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,240
I don't need a drummer.
I just want you to watch me win.

611
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,200
Li Leshan, you are
a woman of valor, a true heroine.

612
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,840
I love your candid and bold character,
unrestrained and unbridled.

613
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,240
Go if you want. Why fear others' gossip?

614
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,320
Leshan.

615
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,560
- Leshan.
- Mother.

616
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,240
Just let him.

617
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,120
Mother, how did you come here?

618
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,640
I asked Fuhui to attend the business.

619
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,840
My son-in-law is competing.
How could I not come to cheer him on?

620
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,480
Leshan.

621
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,920
In Bianjing, women who are at the helm

622
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,800
and start business are no less.

623
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,560
We are not afraid of their mockery.

624
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,600
Besides, your husband has let you go.

625
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,000
Why fear what others might say?

626
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,600
Everyone, compete well for me.

627
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,200
Today, if anyone put on a pitiful face,
I will knock them out.

628
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,840
Good.

629
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,760
Good.

630
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,560
Mother.

631
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,720
This time, our Li family will make
a great name for ourselves in Bianjing.

632
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,640
Just right.

633
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,360
Let all Bianjing see the fine demeanor
of the Li family's daughter.

634
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,760
Put those men to shame.

635
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,120
Good.

636
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,200
Good.

637
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,840
Well…

638
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,440
Qiongnu, let's go.

639
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,520
- Why is there a lady playing the drum?
- Exactly.

640
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,920
That's my daughter.

641
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,560
Leshan.

642
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,640
How come your Yang family
also has ladies entering the arena?

643
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,360
<i>Oh brother.</i>

644
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,560
<i>How dare you act recklessly</i>
<i>in the imperial presence?</i>

645
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,160
Truly formidable.

646
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,120
Yang Xian.

647
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,760
He is back.

648
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,200
Good.

649
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,960
Bravo.

650
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,560
Keep it up.

651
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,160
My lord, hurry.

652
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,160
Go on. Go on.

653
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,080
My lord.

654
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,280
Is everything ready?

655
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,720
It's been ready for a while.

656
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,880
<i>Don't blame me for being heartless.</i>

657
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,920
<i>Why not just accept your fate</i>

658
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,200
<i>and spend a lifetime</i>
<i>as a good-for-nothing?</i>

659
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,120
My lord, be careful.

660
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,320
Charge.

661
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,240
Just a little bit more.

662
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,640
Yang Xian.

663
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,960
Be careful.

664
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,200
So close.

665
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,680
Be careful.

666
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,240
Got it.

667
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,480
I won.

668
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,040
Wonderful.

669
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,360
It's my son-in-law.

670
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,280
My son-in-law is so formidable.

671
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,680
Nice.

672
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,280
Good.

673
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,720
Leshan, I won!

674
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,400
Well done.

675
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,720
Well done.

676
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,960
Truly good.

677
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:11,720
Bravo.

678
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,840
I'm coming.

679
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,680
My lord, slow down.

680
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,480
- Slow down, my lord. Are you alright?
- Yang Xian.

681
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,760
How is it?

682
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,080
- I'm fine.
- This is murder.

683
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,640
They've committed murder.

684
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,080
- Arrest them.
- Are you alright?

685
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,240
Dare to harm my son-in-law.

686
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,160
It's him.

687
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,440
- What are you doing?
- Catch him.

688
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,360
- It's him.
- Let me go.

689
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,240
- It was you. I saw it.
- Who saw it?

690
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,440
Who saw it?

691
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,600
Clearly, it was your son-in-law.
He kicked me down.

692
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,840
Yes, it was him
who caused us to lose the target.

693
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,080
You pay.

694
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,040
I'll hit you.

695
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,160
Hit you.

696
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,640
The shrew is hitting people.

697
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,840
Take this.

698
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,880
The shrew is hitting people.

699
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,280
Which family's fierce lady are you,
playing tough?

700
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,680
Others want to seize the mark.

701
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,680
But they are bent on taking your life.

702
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,360
Just now, from below,
I saw a flash of silver on his shoe.

703
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,280
Something's fishy.

704
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,160
Take him down.

705
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,760
You wronged me.

706
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,080
- The Yang family is bullying others.
- Take it easy.

707
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,440
Take it slow.

708
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,960
Please hear me out.

709
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,440
Let go first.

710
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,120
Xian.

711
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,760
His Majesty graces
the grand event at Jinming Pool.

712
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,840
This fighting and brawling of yours

713
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,880
is a serious crime.

714
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,400
Dishonoring the court adds to the offense.

715
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,400
While His Majesty
has not yet passed sentence,

716
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,880
I hope you will think thrice
before acting.

717
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,040
Do not make it difficult for Jieyu.

718
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,240
It is precisely because it's in front
of His Majesty, under the bright heavens,

719
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,880
that we must expose
those evil spirits in their true form.

720
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,480
Quick, pull off his boots.

721
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,440
Let go of me.

722
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,040
Look.

723
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,800
Everyone, look.

724
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,440
Indeed, a sharp blade is hidden.

725
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,240
This is attempted murder. Look.

726
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,600
What?

727
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,840
Hold him down.

728
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,640
All evidence says you're guilty.
You still run.

729
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,560
By His Majesty's words,

730
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,160
summon the Yang couple for questioning.

731
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,920
Yes.

732
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,640
What did I say?

733
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,840
This is His Majesty deciding your crime.

734
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,320
It's better to keep the peace
and appease people.

735
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,200
Alright, disperse now.

736
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,240
You are all young lords
with impetuous energy.

737
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,440
That's why there was an uproar.
Both sides are at fault.

738
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,760
The fault does not lie with one alone.
My brother is always rash.

739
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,480
I apologize for him.

740
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,680
I apologize on his behalf to everyone.

741
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,960
Let's downplay the issue
and value harmony.

742
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,400
How dare you…

743
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,480
defend the murderer? Isn't that equivalent
to being an accomplice?

744
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,040
I'm going to see His Majesty.

745
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,000
I'll settle the score with you
once I return.

746
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,200
My lady, let's go.

747
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,320
Come on.

748
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,280
You foolish thing.

749
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,840
All my good intentions are wasted.

750
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,280
You don't know what's good for you.

751
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,120
You don't stand up for your family,

752
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,800
you argue in defense of the assailant.

753
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,600
Fortunately, it was in public.

754
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,760
You still wish to
muddle truth with falsehood.

755
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,960
- You…
- What are you saying?

756
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,080
You're like a monkey showing off your
climbing skills, unaware of your flaws.

757
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,880
Let's see if he turns red or not.

758
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,760
I see it.

759
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,240
Making a fool of himself.

760
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,520
- Blushing furiously.
- No laughing allowed.

761
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,640
Stop laughing.

762
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,400
What are you laughing at?

763
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,840
You.

764
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,720
Harmony is precious.

765
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,840
