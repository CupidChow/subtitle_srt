00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,720
EPISODE 10

2
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,640
Sister.

3
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,840
This daughter of the Li family
is promised to someone else.

4
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,720
I can't stop An'er.

5
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,680
What should we do?

6
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,600
Must have been
a stubborn donkey in a past life.

7
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,800
If we can't pray for it,
then there's still a way.

8
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,800
What way?

9
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,800
We snatch.

10
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,760
Aunt.

11
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,080
You usually look kind and gentle,

12
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,760
yet you say something like this.

13
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,880
Really an eye-opener for me.

14
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,160
Lianghan.

15
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,800
I am always nice to you, right?

16
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes.

17
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,120
Convince your lady to be an inside helper.

18
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,320
It's an emergency rescue,
accumulating virtue and merit,

19
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,320
providing relief for others' difficulties,
adding blessings and fortune.

20
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,240
Honey.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,760
Fuhui.

22
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,640
Silly.

23
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,520
Master Chai traveled
a thousand miles for Kangning,

24
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,840
plucking a red plum blossom
from the old mansion

25
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,840
because it's not yet the season
for plum blossoms.

26
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,640
Fearing that Kangning
would be disappointed,

27
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,960
he sought out the best craftsman
to set it with red gemstones.

28
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,880
No matter how many faults his mother has,

29
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,000
considering his sincere efforts,
please also be more lenient.

30
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,400
So, according to you,

31
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,720
this marriage with the Chai family
can work?

32
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,000
Although Master Du is good,

33
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,680
him marrying Kangning
is to repay the kindness.

34
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,760
For a year and a half,

35
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,400
their marriage will work
because Kangning is young and beautiful.

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,280
After ten or eight years,

37
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,360
through the ups and downs
in the officialdom,

38
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,160
his heart hardens
and inevitably, disdain arises.

39
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,440
He will blame us for demanding repayment.

40
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,200
He lacks a powerful family
in the officialdom to support him.

41
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,640
What should Kangning do then?

42
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,080
He wouldn't dare.

43
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,360
Human nature is fickle.

44
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,480
But the Chai family is different.

45
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,280
They begged for Kangning.

46
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,800
Mother, please consider carefully.

47
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,960
Seeing those lands when entering the city,

48
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,680
the Chai family
is wealthy and comfortable.

49
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,440
Kangning would have
reliable support in the future.

50
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,480
What are you talking about
with such enthusiasm?

51
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,880
Tell me about it too.

52
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,280
Fuhui's telling me…

53
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,400
It's nothing.

54
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
Mom, have some oranges.

55
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,800
Kangning is about to get married.

56
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,800
I still have some personal advice
to give her.

57
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,480
Shouhua, stay with Mom a bit longer.

58
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,520
Try it on again,
in case there's any part that doesn't fit.

59
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,800
There's still time to alter it.

60
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,600
I made it myself. How could it not fit?
Put it there. I'll try it on in a moment.

61
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,640
But…

62
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,160
Chunlai.

63
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,680
Chunlai, you can leave now.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,840
Fuhui.

65
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,400
How come you're here at this time?
Have you seen Mom?

66
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,960
Kangning, someone from
the Chai family came at noon.

67
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Madam Chai kowtowed
and bowed to our mother.

68
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,920
She insisted on having you
as her daughter-in-law.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,520
And there's something you should know.

70
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,400
Master Chai is going to sea.

71
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,120
Going to sea?

72
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,720
Fuhui, right after persuading Mom,
hurriedly rushed to Kangning's room.

73
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,400
You sure ran fast.

74
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,160
Kangning, at least go see him.

75
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,520
Try your best to persuade him.
So that your acquaintance wasn't in vain.

76
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,600
If the marriage doesn't work, so be it.
Master Chai has helped many times.

77
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,480
He was literally a lifesaver.

78
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,240
If you choose to ignore this,

79
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,560
then you're not human. Move.

80
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,680
If you wish to send the entire Li family
to their doom, just go ahead.

81
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,160
Shouhua, who are you trying to scare?

82
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,400
- That Du family…
- Mom might not know.

83
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,640
According to the customs of our dynasty,

84
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,680
the top three scholars
of the imperial examination

85
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,200
are imperial supervisors
or judges of the Court of Judicial Review.

86
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,680
The rest are also appointed
to respective official positions.

87
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,680
At first, each official position
isn't prominent,

88
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,600
but those who excel
in the imperial examinations

89
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,200
often rise rapidly within ten years.

90
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,240
Many even become chancellors
within the court.

91
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,760
How dare you underestimate Du Yangxi?

92
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,160
Who knows if in the future,

93
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,760
he isn't a Lv Mengzheng, who served
as prime minister for seven years.

94
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,440
Making such a formidable enemy
is tantamount to dooming your family.

95
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,200
The Li family saved his life
yet he dares to repay kindness with hate.

96
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,960
If he were a magnanimous person,
how could he leave a provoking couplet

97
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
at the Liu family's door?

98
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,600
If he remembered to repay the favor,

99
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,280
why would he wait until his
mother forced him before mentioning it?

100
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,240
Sister, even great tolerance can't endure
the humiliation of a broken engagement.

101
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,840
With you leaving, we can't form
a good relationship with the in-laws.

102
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,960
We'll make enemies.

103
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,000
Since he has such deep schemes,

104
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,600
we can't marry Kangning to him.

105
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,080
We can't outwit him.

106
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,680
Fuhui, go back.

107
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,880
Shouhua.

108
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,400
I've always known you're cold
on the outside, warm on the inside.

109
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,160
Who would have thought you to be
so heartless?

110
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,240
Your mouth is full of schemes and fear.

111
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,400
What about conducting oneself
as Father taught us?

112
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,440
How can we stand by?

113
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,720
Fine, if you won't go, then I will.

114
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,080
Fuhui, stand there.

115
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,840
Let our whole family discuss it.

116
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,640
The mother-in-law is not easily fooled.
This matter surely can't be accomplished.

117
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,200
Then we need to employ a clever strategy

118
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,280
to persuade Madam Li first.

119
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,320
My lady.

120
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,120
My lady, please sit.

121
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,240
This time,
she's really taken a hard stance.

122
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,360
She can't even persuade her own daughter.

123
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,760
Fuhui, we're all family.

124
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,920
You need to think of a good way
to help out your aunt by marriage.

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,560
Mother.

126
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,600
Although my mother
is the head of the household,

127
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,000
in our Li family,

128
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,120
the truly formidable one is someone else.

129
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,200
Your bigger sister?

130
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,240
Shouhua usually doesn't speak much
but, in fact, has very calculated plans.

131
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,160
And mother usually heeds her advice.

132
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,400
She's set on marrying Kangning
to the Du family,

133
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,720
which makes it even harder
for others to persuade.

134
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,360
Then, according to you, this matter
should certainly not be pursued.

135
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,160
Aunt.

136
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,640
Do you really want Kangning to be
the daughter-in-law for the Chai family?

137
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,520
If I dare not to,
then I'll be punished by God.

138
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,280
I'm just afraid your mother and sister
won't allow it.

139
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,320
Even deities can't persuade
a change of mind, let alone you.

140
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,960
With your words, I'm at ease.

141
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,080
Things have come to this,
indeed a bit troublesome.

142
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,080
But it's not necessarily impossible.

143
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,560
Good, my lady.

144
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,560
What's on your mind?

145
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,000
Let's use a two-pronged approach.

146
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
On one hand, I'll step forward

147
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,160
and try to persuade Kangning
to reconsider.

148
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,480
On the other hand,

149
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,680
we'll penetrate the enemy's camp,

150
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,400
disrupt their foothold,

151
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,200
making it difficult for her
to stand alone.

152
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,960
This time, I must confront Shouhua
and fight with her.

153
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,080
Now dressed so lively and spirited.

154
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,040
All made new at the shop.

155
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,040
Why bother with this trouble?

156
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,560
It's no trouble, no trouble at all.

157
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,000
Come on. Sit.

158
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,120
How can those made outside

159
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,040
compare to what's made within the family?

160
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,680
I knew long ago my son-in-law
is no ordinary person.

161
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,960
Destined to rise high.

162
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,120
It's just a matter of time.

163
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,600
You are, after all, the proud mother
of the top provincial scholar.

164
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,040
You need to dress up.

165
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,320
Shouhua arrives.

166
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,120
Feel it, Mrs. Du. Kangning is busy
embroidering the wedding dress.

167
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,840
The clothes have been made
to fit your measurements.

168
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,360
If you find them ill-fitting anywhere,
I'll help you alter them.

169
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,480
They fit well and comfortable.

170
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,320
This was done just by eye
and yet they fit so well.

171
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,760
Truly a fine craft.

172
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,400
I had someone find
my son-in-law's old clothes

173
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,040
and had Shouhua make two new sets.

174
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Later, there's the imperial examination
and the proclamation of his name.

175
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,440
There'll be salutations
to the ancient sages and teachers.

176
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,160
A feast to celebrate the good news.

177
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,080
Without several sets of bright
and fresh clothing, that just won't do.

178
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,640
My dear in-laws.

179
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,240
If it weren't for your thoughtfulness,
I wouldn't have known

180
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,480
about all these
conventional customs underlying it.

181
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,320
I really don't understand these things.

182
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,640
Thanks to Shouhua's reminder,

183
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,360
otherwise,

184
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,880
I almost neglected
my son-in-law's important matters.

185
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,960
Shouhua
must be the Weaver Girl reincarnated.

186
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,360
Such fine stitching.

187
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,160
I wish I had two sons

188
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,600
to marry Shouhua
and take her back home as well.

189
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,320
Before I leave, I must settle
all the old accounts in the shops.

190
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,600
Clear up all of them.

191
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,200
Okay.

192
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,200
Master, the kitchen
at Xiangguo Temple had a leak.

193
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,200
The Chai family donated timber and stones.

194
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,560
The old abbot is very grateful.

195
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,120
Madam wants a water and land ritual
for him, hosted by the old abbot.

196
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,080
She copied scriptures specifically.
Please deliver them yourself tomorrow.

197
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,000
Okay.

198
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,280
You stole the bracelet from our house?
Come on. Follow me.

199
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,880
- I don't know.
- Go.

200
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,120
Cousin.

201
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,120
- What? What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

202
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,920
Shouldn't we go to the temple
to hold the service?

203
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,320
Come on. Let's go.

204
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,880
XIANGGUO TEMPLE

205
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,800
This way, please, Master Chai.

206
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,760
The abbot is waiting in the front kitchen.

207
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,040
Master Chai.The abbot is waiting for you.

208
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,360
Little master.

209
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,880
I've heard your temple
has nice scenery and flourishing incense.

210
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,360
I'd like to admire it too.
I wonder if that would be possible?

211
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,520
I haven't heard today of any ladies
from notable families coming to worship.

212
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,880
Master, feel free to take a walk.

213
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,920
If you encounter any ladies
on the way, then just avoid them.

214
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,800
Shouhua.

215
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,040
I invited Kangning to offer incense

216
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,320
to pray for her future
husband's imperial examination,

217
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,000
but you're following. Are you afraid
I might kidnap Kangning?

218
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,040
We have a traitor in the house.

219
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,640
I must keep a closer eye on Kangning.

220
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,680
Who are you calling a traitor?

221
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,000
In the end, you're one of the Fans.

222
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,360
Come out quickly.

223
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,440
Honey, Shouhua is quite astute.

224
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,480
As though your tricks could fool anyone.

225
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,520
She thinks that by following,
I'll be out of options.

226
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,560
Thinking herself clever.

227
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,840
Right, honey, regarding home…

228
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,640
There's no need for you to babble on.
I've already hired help. Go check on it.

229
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,680
- Don't let Shouhua notice.
- Okay.

230
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,480
This is the newly arrived tea, right?

231
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,200
I will inventory it before storing it.

232
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,160
Haode.

233
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,560
You're here to check the goods.
Why didn't you bring the ledger?

234
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,840
The ledger is all in my mind. Go ahead.

235
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,440
Just trust me.

236
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,720
I checked it twice
at the dock this morning.

237
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,600
This is the 45 wen wax tea.

238
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,040
The 165 wen piece tea,
the large roll medium size.

239
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,280
This is Linghua, green sprout.

240
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,200
This is the poplar wood
and grass paper required by the steward.

241
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,320
You're all talk. I'll just count slowly.

242
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,520
You're here.

243
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,680
No wonder I couldn't find you.

244
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,960
Shouhua asked me to stay.

245
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,120
I'm learning how to take inventory
and receive goods.

246
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,520
You're not one to have the patience
for detail-oriented work.

247
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,360
Go play with Leshan.

248
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,360
When you come back,
ensure the accounts are clear.

249
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,520
Don't worry, I won't tell her.

250
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,680
Really?

251
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,760
Qiongnu, you're so kind.

252
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm leaving. I'll bring you fruit
when I come back.

253
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,160
Don't forget.

254
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,240
Go.

255
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,680
- Hey, wood! Hurry up and move it inside.
- Okay.

256
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,640
Quick, move it inside.

257
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,840
Quick.

258
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,560
Come on.

259
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,520
Great Compassion, Great Mercy, Guan Yin.

260
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,080
I don't ask for marriage

261
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,360
or the future.

262
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,280
Only because someone
is embarking on a long journey.

263
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,240
Especially praying to the Bodhisattva
for blessings.

264
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,960
If this trip goes well,

265
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,800
I ask the Bodhisattva for
a favorable divination. If not possible…

266
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,120
<i>Kangning.</i>

267
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,320
<i>This divination of yours, for me?</i>

268
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,160
If it's not accurate,
then I'll do it again.

269
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,320
Who?

270
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,240
Mother, where's Kangning?

271
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,520
She is worshiping Guan Yin
in the front hall.

272
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,080
Shouhua. I've only been away for a moment.

273
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,400
I'm not a criminal.
No need for round-the-clock vigilance.

274
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,000
What are you talking about?

275
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,160
I don't understand.

276
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,400
The Du family is sending
a betrothal gift.

277
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,200
Mother said we need to get married
before the imperial examination.

278
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,280
Bless me.

279
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,240
The wedding date is set
for the 18th of February.

280
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,480
Shouhua hopes you can postpone
for a couple more days.

281
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
Hesitating because she can't
bear to part with you.

282
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,680
Some people say yes verbally,
but they don't mean it in their heart.

283
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,080
I'm consistent in word and heart.

284
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,960
Shouhua, it's settled then.

285
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,640
Everything is settled. Go back now.

286
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,120
Bodhisattva, I'm leaving.

287
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,160
Such a great opportunity has been missed.
All my painstaking planning was in vain.

288
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,320
The wedding date is set
for the 18th of February.

289
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,040
That's really rushing it. A mother-in-law
fears a good son-in-law being taken away.

290
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,080
February 18th.

291
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,600
What a coincidence,

292
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,240
I'm also setting out on that day.

293
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,880
Won't be able to make it
for the wedding drinks.

294
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,600
Prepare a big gift on my behalf.

295
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,880
What?

296
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,000
Prepare gifts?

297
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,040
Madam Li, congratulations!

298
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,960
The Du family has officially proposed.

299
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,040
Quick, bring over
the matchmakers' gift boxes.

300
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,440
Join in the joy.

301
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,000
A little token of sincerity.
It's not much of a respect.

302
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,520
- Join in the joy!
- Stop!

303
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,600
I'd like to see who dares to forcefully
marry my Chai family's daughter-in-law.

304
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,920
Li Kangning is my Chai family's
daughter-in-law.

305
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,400
Be you a family of official nobility
or a wealthy household?

306
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,520
I'd like to see who dares
to send a marriage proposal.

307
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,320
I'll smash apart anyone who comes.

308
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,080
- Madam Li.
- Who's that outside making such a racket?

309
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,120
- When did your daughter get betrothed?
- Go see.

310
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,640
Shouhua has given her instructions.

311
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
No matter how much commotion
there is outside,

312
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,920
you shouldn't go out.

313
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,080
Why?

314
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,240
Fearing that the Chai family
might abduct you.

315
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,280
The Chai family?

316
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,280
Abducting you?

317
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,200
What a joke.

318
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,480
Since when did Kangning
become your daughter-in-law?

319
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,160
It's for the sake of your son,

320
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,200
Master Chai,

321
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,680
that I respect you.

322
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,560
Otherwise, I would have kicked you out
with a stick long ago.

323
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,680
Dear neighboring gentry
and fellow villagers.

324
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,880
You must bear witness for me.

325
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,400
My family, the Chai,
resides in the city of Bianjing.

326
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,520
We are a family with a good name
and reputation.

327
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,880
I need to pick those families
with generations in officialdom

328
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,600
who wish to marry into my family.

329
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,160
Why would I force a connection
with the Li family?

330
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,160
Let me ask you.

331
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,360
In early October, our two families
exchanged cards and agreed on a marriage.

332
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,560
There is such a thing, right?

333
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,360
Mid-month, my family made the betrothal,

334
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,160
and your Li family gave a reciprocal gift.

335
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,920
Did I ever lie about this?

336
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,560
Two reputable matchmakers
can bear witness for me.

337
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,840
A whole ten boxes for the betrothal gift.

338
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,840
How dare your Li family
go back on the marriage?

339
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,960
We have been matchmakers for 20 years.

340
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,000
Known far and wide,
people all can testify.

341
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,840
Really? How can this be?

342
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,680
- Exactly.
- Such a substantial bride price.

343
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,000
So what?

344
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,760
- Okay.
- Older sister, please save my son.

345
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,120
Madam Chai, the words spoken that day
in the Pan Restaurant,

346
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,680
all have gone down the river.

347
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,120
Just over a few critical remarks
about the betrothal gift.

348
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,320
I've already personally visited
to apologize.

349
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,320
But I never once said I'd back out
of the engagement.

350
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,200
Fuhui, you tell them.

351
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,840
When have I ever said
to back out of the engagement?

352
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,040
So, it's true.

353
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,240
In October, one match was made.
Now, another one follows.

354
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,640
Mother Li, you've made a good deal indeed.

355
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,040
I know.

356
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,480
Promised twice.

357
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,280
Honored neighbors.

358
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,840
You must all stand up for me.

359
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,680
The Li family, watching closely

360
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,600
as the Du family
gained an academic champion,

361
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,400
developed mercenary intentions

362
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,840
and used trivial matters as an excuse

363
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,000
to call off the marriage.

364
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,240
This…

365
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,520
This is just too outrageous.

366
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,000
Madam Chai.

367
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,920
Our two families merely discussed marriage
without actually concluding the betrothal.

368
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,800
So, how can there be talk of retracting
the marriage to marry another?

369
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,680
Who says I didn't give a betrothal gift?

370
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,160
The betrothal gift from my family
is clearly in your house.

371
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,800
This is my family's storeroom.
There's nothing inside, just tea leaves.

372
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,800
- It must be here.
- No.

373
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,520
Someone come here. Search for me!

374
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,800
- Yes.
- No.

375
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,880
- The stuff in here is too delicate.
- Mother.

376
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,200
- I need to sell it for silver, Mother.
- The dowry is but a shadow of a matter.

377
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,720
Have her search and see what she can find.

378
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,520
- No, take a look.
- I need to sell it for silver.

379
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,160
<i>Sudden clearings and rain</i>
<i>are not traits of a good matchmaker.</i>

380
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,000
<i>Unnecessarily stirring up this trouble.</i>

381
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,000
<i>However good this Li Kangning might be,</i>

382
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,600
<i>I'm afraid this may not be</i>
<i>the good fortune destined for my son.</i>

383
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,600
Careful! Careful.
I need to sell this for money.

384
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,320
- Ms. Chai.
- If it gets damp, it won't sell.

385
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,400
- These are all our family's tea leaves.
- Everyone, take a look.

386
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,000
Tea that's dampened doesn't sell well.

387
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,280
It's okay.

388
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,600
Are these tea leaves?

389
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,280
Look.

390
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,880
Everyone, look.

391
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,320
This is from my Chai family.

392
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,440
A prepared beaded and jade coronet.

393
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,960
Four pairs of gold bracelets.

394
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,840
This is a tea cake.

395
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,520
This is foreign wine.

396
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,040
Look.

397
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,040
How did my fine tea goods

398
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,440
all become a dowry?

399
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,680
Mother, there is a girl at home
serving as an offering.

400
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,640
She betrayed her own mother and sisters.

401
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,520
Right, everything in this box
is of the highest quality.

402
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,960
- Fine silk.
- The evidence is as solid as a mountain.

403
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,880
Dare to marry off the daughter
to someone else!

404
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,680
I'll take you to court over this!

405
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,640
Madam Li, it's your fault.

406
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,520
How can you go back on your word?

407
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,520
This shouldn't be said like this.

408
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,560
Your love for your daughter
has made you a mercenary.

409
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,800
It's human nature, after all.

410
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,040
But one mountain always
looks higher than the next.

411
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,320
Promising marriage and changing your mind.
This violates the Great Song laws.

412
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,600
That's right.

413
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,400
Sue me. It's up to you.

414
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,800
Sue me. Go ahead and sue me.

415
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,800
It was your family who despised poverty
and loved wealth first

416
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,320
and did not marry into my family.

417
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,960
Now, it's all good.

418
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,200
Now, you turn around
and come back crawling.

419
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,240
Is there such a headless lawsuit?

420
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,960
I wonder who will take your complaint?

421
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,600
Quickly ask your two daughters.

422
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,760
Dare to betroth the daughter
and marry her off to another.

423
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,960
That calls for a hundred strokes
of punishment.

424
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,600
A punishment of one,
a hundred strokes indeed.

425
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,200
Mother.

426
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,760
- Injustice!
- How can I, one woman, marry two men?

427
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,760
This is bad, Fourth Sister.
Discuss with the Du family.

428
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,400
- It's making my life difficult.
- I'll have to go right away.

429
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,120
It's not good to let the Du family know.

430
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,080
The matchmaker's left.

431
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,960
With such a commotion,
the neighbors will hear.

432
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,920
- No, hurry up and go.
- But…

433
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,520
Don't push. Who is this?

434
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,320
Madam Li, Madam Chai.

435
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,480
My old lady has said

436
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,720
that both of you come
from respectable families.

437
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,320
Let's not let outsiders laugh about it.

438
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,040
Everything can be discussed.

439
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,080
You two, please talk in the courtyard.

440
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,280
Madam.

441
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,280
An'er, rest assured.

442
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,520
Although the Li family are troublemakers,

443
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,040
if it really comes to a fight,
then Mother won't lose.

444
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,120
If she still refuses to back down,
then I'll take her to court.

445
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,440
Auntie, you're really imposing.

446
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,360
You dare to say
it was all your instigation.

447
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,800
Mother.

448
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,920
It hurts.

449
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,520
What?

450
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,800
- Isn't it all for you?
- I don't need it.

451
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,560
For this marriage, to frame the Li family
for reneging on the marriage.

452
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,600
You've the nerve to think of it,
all rotten ideas.

453
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,760
Let me tell you.

454
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,480
I'm definitely going to Quanzhou.

455
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,680
The date is set.
No one can change my mind.

456
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,240
If my mother makes a scene again
I'll beat you up.

457
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,520
Aunt.

458
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,440
Does it hurt,
scratching yourself like that?

459
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,080
What do you think?

460
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,200
- The skin is broken.
- Exactly.

461
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,880
That was quite a heavy hand.

462
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,000
Have these two gone mad
to actually manage a laugh?

463
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,320
Master, for whom are mistress
and Master Fan here?

464
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,960
You know well.
Anyhow, accept this kindness.

465
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,360
- Just--
- Hold your tongue.

466
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,880
- Prepare the gifts right away.
- Let's go to the Li family now.

467
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,600
After this slap, without sweets,
wouldn't my hand hurt in vain?

468
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,240
Come with me to the Du family.

469
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,800
Du family.

470
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,720
Master.

471
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,640
Isn't it winning first place on
the provincial exam?

472
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,640
Two years ago, when Meng wanted a house,
didn't he ask our lord for a loan?

473
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,800
And he gets to act big in front of you.

474
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,880
And that Lingyao,
is another example of ingratitude.

475
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,040
Indeed, it was our fault to begin with.

476
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,160
It's only right to wait a bit longer.

477
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,040
What? Has this already
tired out your legs?

478
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,840
I wouldn't dare.

479
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,120
Yuanming.

480
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,120
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

481
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,400
Look at me, getting so engrossed
in reading I forget all else.

482
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,160
Forgive me if there's
been any discourtesies.

483
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,560
It is we who have disturbed you.

484
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,080
Yesterday, it was my mother
who was at fault first.

485
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,560
I only fear you might take offense.

486
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,400
We've come to your door to apologize.

487
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
We even thought Yuanming
would not let us in.

488
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,040
Nonsense. Come in and let's talk.

489
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,880
Please.

490
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,760
Old An.

491
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,760
- Slow down.
- Who is that?

492
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,520
That's a famous rich merchant
from Bianjing, with the surname Chai.

493
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,000
Chai.

494
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,760
Could it be him?

495
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,280
Old An.

496
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,880
Two years ago,

497
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,840
when Master Chai was on a business trip,
did he ever pass through Ezhou?

498
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,480
Let me tell you, when he gets there,
he won't have imagined it to be like this.

499
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,440
I know.

500
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,880
Isn't this method quite good?

501
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,000
An'er.

502
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,560
- Cousin.
- You're back.

503
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,120
I was thinking of discussing with you.

504
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,960
Mother, I've apologized
to the Du family on your behalf.

505
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,880
Explained the ins and outs.

506
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,680
The marriage alliance between
the Du and Li families remains as before.

507
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
Let this matter end here.

508
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,440
You don't want to marry
Li Kangning anymore?

509
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,200
No. If you two make trouble again,

510
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,960
then I'll set off for Quanzhou tomorrow.

511
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,280
An'er.

512
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,680
An'er.

513
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,000
If you want to go to Quanzhou,
I won't stop you.

514
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,720
But you have to get married before you go.

515
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,880
- Get married?
- Yes.

516
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,080
After all, you can't marry
Li Kangning anymore.

517
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,000
Whoever you marry, it's all the same.
I'll decide for you.

518
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,560
Do you think marriage is like buying
something at the market?

519
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,680
You miss it early,
so you get something random.

520
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,720
I don't have that habit.

521
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,600
I advise you to give up this idea.

522
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,480
I brought you up,

523
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,520
and now you're educating Mother.

524
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,440
The Du family's wedding is on February 18.
I'll do it on the 16th.

525
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,280
I'll make it grand and lively.

526
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,520
Wait and see.

527
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,040
Fan Lianghan, what are you doing?

528
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,720
Cousin, Aunt sent me to tie you up.

529
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,200
It's only right for a mother
to bind her son.

530
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,880
Just be honest and you'll suffer less.

531
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,640
Fan Lianghan. Aren't you afraid
I'll dislocate your bones?

532
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,280
No.

533
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,000
No.

534
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,800
No.

535
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,280
Come, prop him up for me.

536
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,120
Move.

537
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,880
Fan Lianghan, tell them to let me go.
Who is your master?

538
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,240
You always want to teach people lessons.
I've endured you for over ten years.

539
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,480
Today, I can hold my head high
and breathe freely.

540
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,360
Chai An, you domineering tyrant.

541
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,760
Now you've met your match.

542
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,560
Come, gag his mouth for me.

543
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,800
- Quickly.
- I'm telling you, you're finished.

544
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,720
Fan Lianghan.

545
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,840
Fan Lianghan.

546
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,200
Why are you still tied up? It's not right.

547
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,040
Mother, no.

548
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,320
Look, we just put
the wedding attire on him.

549
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,800
It took six people to hold him down.

550
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,000
Look, he bit me.

551
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,760
- Mother, look.
- Let him go.

552
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,480
Stop right there.

553
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,840
Try to leave today and see what happens.

554
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,280
If you dare to go to Quanzhou,
I'll hang myself right before your eyes.

555
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,520
I'll die right now for you.

556
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,480
You're my son.

557
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,600
Your nature of keeping your word

558
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,960
may not have fallen from the sky.

559
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,080
The son takes after his mother.

560
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,040
Mother, please don't deceive me anymore.
I don't believe you would really bear it.

561
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,640
You've got a hold on my pulse.

562
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,400
I understand you too.

563
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,560
You want to leave, I won't stop you,
but the wedding invitations are sent out.

564
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,600
Your father's acquaintances
and old friends.

565
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,480
The Chai family's close relatives
and friends.

566
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,080
And those business associates of yours,
I invited them all.

567
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,480
These people are just outside waiting
to have the wedding banquet.

568
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,280
I really want to see if you can leave
these guests behind.

569
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,320
You can board the boat with peace of mind.

570
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,720
Mother, don't force me.

571
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,960
Madam.

572
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,880
The bridal sedan chair is at the door.

573
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,080
I'm not forcing you. Your choice.

574
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,440
Want to make the Chai family lose face

575
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,840
and become the joke of the city,

576
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,960
or the generations of management
destroyed in one fell swoop?

577
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,840
You just go.

578
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,120
He's really gone, Aunt.

579
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,400
What's the rush?

580
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,800
The bridal sedan chair is at the door.
Where could he run to?

581
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,240
Right.

582
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,920
Why just stand there?
Hurry to welcome the bridal sedan chair.

583
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
- Go quickly.
- Alright.

584
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,720
Everything's here. It's all here.

585
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,440
Scatter the beans and grains.

586
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,200
Welcoming good fortune now.

587
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,560
Scatter the grain beans.

588
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,680
Welcoming the joy now.

589
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,680
Here comes the bridegroom.

590
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,880
Everyone, make way.

591
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,400
Congratulations to the bridegroom.

592
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,240
Please, everyone, quiet down.

593
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,960
I have something to say.

594
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,000
The Chai family is getting married,

595
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,240
but I, the bridegroom,
don't even know which family

596
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,720
the girl I'm to marry is from.

597
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,760
The person in the sedan chair probably

598
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,320
is still in the dark about it.

599
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,200
I will soon set off for Quanzhou

600
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,520
to conduct business overseas.

601
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,680
It might take three to five years
to return.

602
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,240
Even if I return, I won't acknowledge
this marriage.

603
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,000
Once you enter this doorway,

604
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,760
it'll be nothing
but a waste of your youth.

605
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,960
Time will slip away in vain.

606
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,080
Fortunately, the wedding ceremony
is not yet complete.

607
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,080
You haven't worshiped
heaven and earth with me.

608
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,320
Not entering my family's ancestral temple,
then you're not truly one of the Chai's.

609
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,640
I will immediately
write a letter of divorce

610
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,920
describing today's events in detail.

611
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,520
The betrothal gifts from my Chai family

612
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,400
were all to provide dowry
for the young lady.

613
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,080
May you, miss, soon leave this suffering

614
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,640
and once again don the phoenix crown,

615
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,360
seeking a distinguished
and talented family

616
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,440
to form another fine match.

617
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,880
Where did this bridal sedan come from?

618
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,320
Take it back to where it came from.

619
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,240
Kangning, did you hear
what the bridegroom said?

620
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,640
He's ordering the bridal sedan
to turn around

621
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,840
and head back to the mansion.

622
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,400
Lift the sedan.

623
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,320
Kangning.

624
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,360
Master Chai, where are you going?

625
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,120
- Didn't you let the sedan turn around?
- I--

626
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,120
As the dignified head of the Chai family,
how can you go back on your word?

627
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,560
Sister-in-law.

628
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,760
Fuhui.

629
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,280
You're so kind.

630
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,960
If you don't show mercy,

631
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,720
then I won't make it through.

632
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,480
I have bowed before you
and paid my respects.

633
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,240
Then what do you call me?
Call me brother-in-law.

634
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,000
- It's time. Please come down.
- Play the music.

635
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,760
Nice.

636
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,000
Hold on.

637
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,480
Let's not mention the earlier rudeness.

638
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,720
Now, we must follow the customs
of the wedding ritual.

639
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,600
- Don't worry. It's not your turn yet, son.
- Okay.

640
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,800
Here.

641
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,920
If you dare to make another sound,
then I'll throw you down the mountain.

642
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,760
- I'll poke you…
- Callous, cruel, and shameless.

643
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,480
Done yet?

644
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,280
First wish, for the lotus to bloom
with joined petals.

645
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,880
Second wish, for the birth
of a precious child soon.

646
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,800
Third prayer, for wealth, honor,
and splendor.

647
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,280
Fourth blessing,
for auspicious fortune and peace.

648
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,760
For the couple to live harmoniously
until old age.

649
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,040
Good.

650
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,960
Good.

651
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,320
Good.

652
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,320
Two newlyweds,
please drink the nuptial cup.

653
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,200
Tilting the cup to coincide with a union.

654
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,600
Yin and Yang in harmony.

655
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,480
Great luck and great prosperity.

656
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,160
A match made in heaven.

657
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,640
Good.

658
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,440
Bridegroom, it's time to toast.

659
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,760
Let's go.

660
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,520
Bye.

661
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,600
Good.

662
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,360
Come on. Let's drink.

663
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,000
Let's drink.

664
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,680
Come on.

665
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,800
Let's go.

666
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,200
Let's go.

667
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,240
What a joy.

668
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,160
- Come on.
- We have to be drunk.

669
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,720
Chai An.

670
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,080
Master.

671
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,680
If today inside
that sedan chair wasn't me,

672
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,640
then you're really going to Quanzhou?

673
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,200
Yes.

674
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,360
But…

675
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,560
But what?

676
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,640
But…

677
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,600
I'm taking you with me.

678
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,520
Okay.

679
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,000
So your deployment
was a self-sacrificing ruse.

680
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,560
No.

681
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,800
My lady.

682
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,400
What I have done

683
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,040
is called "put oneself in apparent peril,
then to recover".

684
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,280
The Li family is full
of complaints against me.

685
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,800
You're filled with misunderstandings.

686
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,560
My mother is stubbornly misguided.

687
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,680
I had no choice but this last-ditch plan.

688
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,280
To reconcile my mother-in-law with
my mother and dispel their past grudges

689
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,480
and to make you constantly worry about me

690
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,880
with anxiety and deep concern.

691
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,600
There actually exists such
a deceitful person like you in this world.

692
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,160
- You clearly deceived me into marrying--
- Kangning.

693
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,200
Dear Kangning.

694
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,680
Although you have your strategy,

695
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,400
without my convenient easterly wind

696
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,360
just turning a blind eye,

697
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,960
let's see how you'll manage
to hoist the sail

698
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,600
and steer the ship.

699
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,960
Kangning.

700
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,760
There are no strangers here.
No need to be shy.

701
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,640
The matter of marriage.

702
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,760
I need to hear your opinion.

703
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,680
I…

704
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,600
Her thoughts…

705
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,800
No need to ask.

706
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,040
You can tell.

707
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,480
Shouhua, you have seen it
with your own eyes.

708
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,680
Forced Kangning to marry Du Shengyuan.

709
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,000
Afraid she'll be dissatisfied
all her life.

710
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,160
I see that Du Yangxi is very scheming.

711
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,600
Not very easy to deal with.

712
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,680
I worry I can't handle it myself.

713
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,160
The Li family would suffer from it.

714
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,320
Shouhua, good sister.

715
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,160
Save me.

716
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,040
If he had no schemes, then how
would he stand in the officialdom?

717
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,880
You are good at assigning roles.

718
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,040
I think you just can't bear
to part with Chai An.

719
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,760
What's the difficulty? The Du family
just wants to repay a kindness.

720
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,640
It's not necessarily
about which one to get.

721
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,760
Nice.

722
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,880
Mother negotiated
with the Du family matriarch.

723
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,160
Have someone replace Kangning.

724
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,280
I knew it.

725
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,280
As usual.

726
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,040
As usual, no one renege.

727
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,480
Shouhua said

728
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,360
that she has a way to make
the Du family change their stance.

729
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,760
Agree to this "substituting
the plum for the peach" strategy.

730
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,720
Okay.

731
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,000
Turns out your family
had colluded long ago.

732
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,800
Specifically plotting against
this fool in love.

733
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,520
The commotion is inevitable.

734
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,440
Besides, my family is in a tough spot.

735
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,200
Must do it for the Du family to see.

736
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,080
My mother has spoken.

737
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,080
The Chai family's previous cancellation
of the marriage was too heartless.

738
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,840
She's still mad.

739
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,320
And you, you even made Fuhui
an inside mole.

740
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,720
You must use
this counter-espionage strategy.

741
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,840
Can't help but make you worry to the core.

742
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,480
How can it show that
the Li family's daughters are hard to get?

743
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,800
Hard to get.

744
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,400
Indeed.

745
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,560
However, there's one thing

746
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,480
that Du Shengyuan doesn't have,
but only I, Chai An, possess.

747
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,880
What?

748
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,600
Your heart…

749
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,480
is mine.

750
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,880
