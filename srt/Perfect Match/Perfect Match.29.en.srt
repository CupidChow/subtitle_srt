EPISODE 29

2
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,480
YANG'S MANSION

3
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,400
You can still sleep?

4
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,840
It's all your fault.

5
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,600
That almost killed me.

6
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,800
You deserved it.

7
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,160
Don't waste your energy.

8
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,680
Once you marry into my family of Yang,
you can't escape.

9
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,160
My mother will be here any minute.
She'll tear you apart.

10
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,240
Leshan.

11
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,000
Leshan.

12
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,200
Leshan.

13
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,880
Mom.

14
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,400
- Mom.
- It's okay.

15
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,480
Don't be afraid. I am here.

16
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,640
I'm here. Don't cry.

17
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,280
Your sisters are all here.

18
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,000
- You…
- Don't waste your time here.

19
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,800
Take Leshan back home.

20
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,040
We'll meet at Kaifeng Court.

21
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,400
Right, Master Du
is on his way to the He's.

22
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,160
We'll file a lawsuit
against Yang together.

23
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,160
Kidnapping a woman in broad daylight.
Let's see the consequences.

24
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,080
It's alright. Let's go back. Come on.

25
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,840
Madam Li.

26
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,600
Sorry for not greeting you earlier,
in-laws.

27
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,800
Please forgive me.

28
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,200
In-laws? We are not in-laws.
Good shoes won't step on stinky shit.

29
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,560
A good family like us

30
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,520
can't be in-laws to you, bullies.

31
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,960
You old turtle-like geezer,
you're just in time.

32
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,640
I'll take you to court,
and let's talk there.

33
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,840
Let's go.

34
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,960
Let go. Let go of my husband.

35
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,800
You are such a rude woman.

36
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,400
You vile woman!

37
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,320
You don't discipline your son.

38
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,360
Your son has done
such a shameful and immoral thing,

39
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,360
- yet you are saying I'm rude?
- Let go.

40
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,720
- You are no noble one.
- Let go.

41
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,040
- Don't try to put on airs here.
- Don't.

42
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,080
You said I'm rude? So what?

43
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,160
- Mother.
- Madam.

44
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,400
- Mother.
- Mother, are you okay?

45
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,920
We respect you for being an elder.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,880
You come into our home to create a scene.
Don't you care about your reputation?

47
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,880
You!

48
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,960
We created a scene?

49
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,080
It was your son
who created a scene himself

50
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,160
by taking Leshan here by force.

51
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,680
He brought it upon himself.
Who is to be blamed?

52
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,880
If anyone dares to release them
without authorization,

53
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,840
take 50 strokes.

54
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,960
Guard! Did you all see that?

55
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,080
Catch these shrews.

56
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,520
Guards!

57
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,240
Catch them!

58
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,720
Who dares!

59
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,280
How can one abduct a woman
in broad daylight?

60
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,680
Is there any law and order here?

61
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,520
Don't move. Stop!

62
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,600
What are you doing?

63
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,760
Madam Li.

64
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,160
This matter was chaos born of fate.

65
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,080
The mistakes happen one after another.
The brides were switched in the end.

66
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,640
What's done is done.

67
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,960
It's embarrassing for both families
to keep this up.

68
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,600
Maybe we should sit down
and discuss this matter properly.

69
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,200
Sit and discuss this? No way.
There's nothing to discuss. Let's go.

70
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,600
- Don't…
- You!

71
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,720
Master.

72
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,960
- Say it.
- The He family arrived.

73
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,840
My eldest son-in-law
went to the He family.

74
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,040
Didn't he come with you?

75
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,080
I…

76
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,840
have never met Mr. Du.

77
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,880
We must have taken different paths
on the way.

78
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,520
Madam Li.

79
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,320
Your daughter is beautiful, intelligent,
gentle, and virtuous.

80
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,280
It's a pity that I am not that fortunate

81
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,440
to marry such a fine woman.

82
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,960
If we were married,

83
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,120
I fear I can't bear such a good fortune.

84
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,320
So, please choose another son-in-law
to avoid ruining Leshan's life.

85
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,400
Mr. He, what are you talking about?

86
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,280
Good things always come
with many obstacles.

87
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,120
My daughter was taken here unwillingly.

88
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,120
But fortunately, she's clever
and hasn't suffered any loss.

89
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,480
You should just take her back

90
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,520
and complete the wedding ceremony
all over again.

91
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,040
Then you will still be a fine couple.

92
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,280
How can you call off the marriage
just because of a temporary discord?

93
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,680
You are young and inexperienced.
Ask your parents to decide for you.

94
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,920
Madam Li.

95
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,720
I…

96
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
Shiniang.

97
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
Last night, I got drunk
and mistook her for Leshan.

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,880
I have already spent
the night with Shiniang.

99
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,920
Now, we can only acknowledge the marriage,
despite the mistake.

100
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,440
Leshan, I am really sorry.

101
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,160
Indeed, he is a nice young man
with both virtue and talent.

102
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,640
He changed so quickly.

103
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,160
If it were me,

104
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,720
I would really be ashamed.

105
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,720
Mind your words. Shut up.

106
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,840
How dare you call off the marriage!

107
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,440
Mom.

108
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,280
The He family is not meant for me.
Don't force it.

109
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,160
The deed is done.

110
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,280
Might as well do him a favor
and make them a couple.

111
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,120
<i>She is indeed quite forthright.</i>

112
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,440
Mr. He.

113
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,800
You gave me this gold hairpin before.

114
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,160
Today, I shall return it to you.

115
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,440
From this moment, we
call off the marriage and sever ties.

116
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,960
You could find another marriage match,

117
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,400
so could I.

118
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,280
This is reasonable. We have nothing
to do with each other anymore.

119
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,560
Give it back to him.

120
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,000
- What are you doing?
- You are a grown man.

121
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,360
Who are you showing that look to?

122
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,280
Do you think no one
knows the filth in your mind?

123
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,080
You fear the powerful Yang family
and it will drag you.

124
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,800
So, you're willing to be humiliated,
just to flatter them.

125
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,560
You can even give away your betrothed.

126
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,560
Where's your dignity?

127
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,480
Fortunately, I did not marry you.
Otherwise, I would rather be a nun

128
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,800
than join you in being a coward.

129
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,200
Well done. You called off the marriage.

130
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,480
I think you deserve a slap.

131
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,840
The Li family never suffers a loss,
so this settles it.

132
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,840
What a shrew!

133
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,480
My brother Xian.

134
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,240
Our family can't take her in.

135
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,000
A brave woman and a weak man do not match.

136
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,720
That coward dares not marry you, but I do.

137
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,120
That's it. Show the guests out.

138
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,680
Yes, please.

139
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,400
What a timid, shameless person!

140
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,920
Off you go.

141
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,200
The He family calls off the marriage
and seeks another,

142
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,640
so faithless, shameless, and ignorant.

143
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,480
Madam Li, since Leshan and Xian

144
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,320
have already completed
the wedding ceremony,

145
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,560
this can be called a match made by fate.

146
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,720
If we could become in-laws,

147
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,440
it would also be in accordance with fate.

148
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,200
If you do agree,

149
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,360
from now on,

150
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,240
Leshan will henceforth
be a part of our Yang family.

151
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,760
You old…

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,400
Thank you, Assistant Commander Yang.

153
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,240
In marriage, it's more than
matching skills and appearances

154
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,400
but also the personalities.

155
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,000
If the husband and wife
are at odds and incompatible,

156
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,440
then this marriage will breed enmity.

157
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,600
Shouhua, don't bother talking to him.

158
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,680
The Li daughters' marriage
is none of any outsider's concern.

159
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,360
If you have anything to say,
let's meet at the court tomorrow.

160
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,760
- Let's go.
- Wait.

161
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,840
- Wait.
- Master.

162
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,400
Congratulations.

163
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,520
Commander Zhang.

164
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,480
Congratulations, Assistant Commander Yang.

165
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,600
His Majesty heard of your son's wedding.

166
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,000
On this auspicious day,

167
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,640
His Majesty bestows you a plaque
with his imperial inscription,

168
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,640
100 taels of gold, and various fine silks

169
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,880
to celebrate the wedding
of the Yang and Li families.

170
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,480
"A match made in heaven."

171
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,680
Well…

172
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,200
Everyone, aren't you grateful
for the blessing?

173
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,720
The Emperor's grace is boundless.

174
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,520
Long live His Majesty.

175
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,160
Let's go. The Song dynasty
has the Bureau for Letters.

176
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,280
I'll make a complaint
to the Jinluan Palace.

177
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,800
I don't believe
there's no justice in this world.

178
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,280
Let's go.

179
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,800
Mom, I won't go.

180
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,240
Leshan, you can't give up at this moment.

181
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,600
Today, I've seen that the Yang family
is just covering up their son's mistake.

182
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,000
There was no proper apology at all
after we arrived.

183
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,360
They even had
the imperial plaque from His Majesty.

184
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,320
They wanted to use their power
to pressure us.

185
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,120
Alright, let's go.

186
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,640
- Why are you so stubborn?
- Mom.

187
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,520
Mom.

188
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,200
I understand what Leshan thinks.

189
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,840
His Majesty has known about this matter.

190
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,840
It's not a trivial matter
between the families.

191
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,440
Even if we plead before His Majesty,

192
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,840
we have no proof
that the Yang family switched brides.

193
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,800
If the royal family wanted to take sides,

194
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,720
they would see it as a minor mistake
caused by market fusses.

195
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,960
She's the one who entered
the Yang family's sedan chair.

196
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,880
By then,
Leshan's reputation might be ruined,

197
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,840
and she would be accused
of deceiving the Emperor.

198
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,840
Huh?

199
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,160
Why should I fear him?
I've been bold since childhood.

200
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,520
Is it really that serious?

201
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,640
- Do we really let Leshan marry him?
- No way.

202
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,760
That Yang Xian is a fop,
and the Yang family is a den of iniquity.

203
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,640
Leshan can't stay there.

204
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,680
Kangning.

205
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,000
Back then, the ladies from Shen's
were trapped by bandits.

206
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,720
Master Yang happened to be hunting nearby.

207
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,120
He wiped out the bandits with servants.

208
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,760
He's not proficient in martial arts,

209
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,960
yet he dared to risk his life
to save others.

210
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,960
I think he's not a bad guy.

211
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,840
My dear sisters, don't worry about me.
If the Yang family welcomes me that much,

212
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,400
then I might as well accept it

213
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,840
to stay and be Yang Xian's wife,

214
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,560
to repay his life-saving grace.

215
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,520
But fortune and misfortune
are unpredictable.

216
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,640
He can marry me,

217
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,920
but he might not be able
to put up with me.

218
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,040
I can put up with her.

219
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,200
You scoundrel!

220
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,320
What are you doing? Don't hit my son.

221
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,680
Hit me.

222
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,680
Luckily, you have other sons.
Beating me to death won't harm you.

223
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,120
You!

224
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,120
Lady Yan comes from a prestigious family.

225
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
She's talented and beautiful.
You don't marry her,

226
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,920
instead, you marry such a shrew.

227
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,440
What do you want?

228
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,080
In Bianjing, when someone marries,
they get to see each other beforehand.

229
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,400
Her temperament, looks, and personality.
You know nothing about that.

230
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,400
Nor did you send anyone
to inquire about it.

231
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,200
How can you know if we'll get along well?

232
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,800
Listen.

233
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,800
You are unruly and dissolute.

234
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,880
Do you think she doesn't deserve you?

235
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,400
A woman who eloped with her cousin
to Shouzhou three years ago,

236
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,240
abandoned her husband to return home
because of poverty,

237
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,720
- of course, I don't deserve her.
- What?

238
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,080
Wait.

239
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,000
Where did you hear all this?

240
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,280
Rumors, all rumors.

241
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,560
Fine, even if it's true,

242
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,720
but the Yan family…

243
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,560
I know.

244
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,840
Her grandfather was just appointed as
the Deputy Minister of Ministry of Works.

245
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,880
As my father, you treat my marriage
as a trade.

246
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,920
You weigh it carefully
and put a label to it.

247
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,960
As your son, I learned from you
and made the switch.

248
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,680
- That's not surprising, is it?
- You!

249
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,520
Our whole family is filthy
and beyond cure.

250
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,360
Let's not loathe each other
and just get by.

251
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,480
- You!
- Xian.

252
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,080
- What are you doing?
- Right.

253
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,320
Lady Yan didn't want to marry me, a fop,

254
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,880
so she just went with the flow.

255
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,680
You'd better think

256
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,400
how to explain this
to Deputy Minister Yan.

257
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,360
What should I do about this?

258
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,200
- You won't sue them anymore?
- No.

259
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,720
Compromising is not
the family motto of the Li family.

260
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,960
I even consulted with
my brothers-in-law during the day

261
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,760
on how to deal
with the arrogant Yang family.

262
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,000
And you won't sue them anymore now?

263
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,320
Madam never suffers a loss.

264
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,320
Can she accept this?

265
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,440
Leshan is always being capricious.

266
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,440
But at critical moments,
she knows what to do.

267
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,320
No one can sway her.

268
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,960
Yang Xian is by no means a good man.

269
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,160
Are you really at ease
entrusting Leshan to him?

270
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,360
When we left,

271
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,120
Kangning left all the best servants behind

272
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,400
and told them to temporarily stay
in the Yang family's outer courtyard.

273
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,520
If anything happens,

274
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,960
we won't let Leshan suffer.

275
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,280
It's done. Give it a try.

276
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,720
Four of us sisters together
can't beat Leshan.

277
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,160
At home,

278
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,480
if it weren't for mother,
she would have been domineering.

279
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,240
The Yang family bullies us
with their power.

280
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,040
She's very unhappy about it.

281
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,960
How can she easily
let Yang Xian off the hook?

282
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,200
Just wait and see.

283
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,480
It's just right.

284
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,200
Li Leshan, open the door.

285
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,120
Li Leshan, open the door.

286
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,840
Li Leshan, this is my room.

287
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,840
Li Leshan, open the door.

288
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,240
- Master.
- Get lost.

289
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,360
- Li Leshan, open the door.
- Let's go.

290
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,640
Open the door. I know you're in there.

291
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,640
You open the door.

292
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,320
You open the door now,
and we can still talk it over.

293
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,720
Li Leshan.

294
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,920
Open the door.

295
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,120
Master shouted himself hoarse,
but Lady Li did not open the door.

296
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,000
Master went to the study
to sleep in anger.

297
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,880
Knowing she was no virtuous woman,
yet he insisted on marrying her.

298
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,520
How dare she bully my son like this!
I will not spare her.

299
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,840
- Mother.
- Mother.

300
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,000
You've heard from Yinping
that she's bolted the door shut.

301
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,720
No matter what, she won't open the door.

302
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,640
Mother, what are you going to do?

303
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,240
How dare she! I am her mother-in-law.

304
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,360
What can she do
if I have the door broken down?

305
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,280
Mother, His Majesty has just
bestowed us a plaque today.

306
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,920
If we cause a scene at night,

307
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,720
we'll be laughed at
when the words get out.

308
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,040
Ridiculous!

309
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,800
We can't be hesitant and indecisive.

310
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,040
With so many in the Yang family,
no one can't deal with such a girl?

311
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,440
Do you want me to bear her?

312
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,400
Mother, please calm your anger.

313
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,000
When the people from the Li family left,
they left behind many servants.

314
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,760
Fortunately, my husband is clever

315
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,760
and kept them all isolated
in the outer courtyard.

316
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,760
Although they are still
at the Yang's mansion,

317
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,720
it's inconvenient
to come in the inner courtyard.

318
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,440
You are her mother-in-law.

319
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,560
It's easy to deal with a girl.

320
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,880
Don't get agitated.

321
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,440
Well, why not do so?

322
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,240
My lady, Madam Yang has asked you
to see her right after you freshen up.

323
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,120
BLESSINGS PASS ON GENERATIONS

324
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,760
My lady, Madam Yang is in here.

325
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,960
Please.

326
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,400
What are you doing?

327
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,440
My lady, please forgive me.

328
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,360
Madam Yang said

329
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,200
it's customary the bride honors
the ancestors the day after the wedding,

330
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,240
but you made a big scene yesterday,

331
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,120
alarmed the ancestors
and brought us misfortune.

332
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,960
So, you have to kneel
in the ancestral hall for a few hours

333
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,000
to reflect properly on your own.

334
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,400
At noon, we will bring you tea and food.

335
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,400
How dare you scheme against me!
Open the door.

336
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,200
Hurry!

337
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,480
You!

338
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,400
Alright.

339
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,720
Mr. Yang.

340
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,000
You've just gotten married. Today,
you should visit the bride's family.

341
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,440
Yet you invited us
to enjoy tea and music here.

342
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,720
Li family? Who are they?

343
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Do they deserve
Master Yang's personal visit?

344
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,520
Is it your place to speak ill
against my wife's family?

345
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,400
Sorry.

346
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,720
I'm only talking nonsense.

347
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,240
Deserves a beating, indeed.

348
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,400
Yes. Knowing well
that the Li family is of humble origin,

349
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,040
I didn't know
that their family is full of beauties.

350
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,000
I thought Mr. Zhao was exaggerating.

351
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,720
Even Master Yang went to great lengths
to exchange the bride.

352
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,680
I guess it is true.

353
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,480
Said by Zhao Liangcheng again?

354
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,880
His newly wedded concubine
is ill with heart sickness.

355
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,800
Otherwise, he would have come.

356
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,240
There are no outsiders here.

357
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,400
Logically speaking,
you should bring your wife here

358
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,240
to let us meet.

359
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,800
Exactly, bring her here.

360
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,600
Right, it is proper to bring her here
to receive greetings.

361
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,200
Hearing about is better than the actual
meeting. You'd better not to meet her.

362
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,640
Is she very ugly?

363
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,880
- How ugly is she?
- How ugly, indeed?

364
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,200
Just one glance at her,
and your insides start to smoke.

365
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,280
A second glance at her,
and you'll bleed from all orifices.

366
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,080
A third glance at her,

367
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,880
and you'll die on the spot.

368
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,360
Just this?

369
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,840
After all, she is a newly wedded bride.

370
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,640
Madam Yang said the Yang family
always gathers blessings and splendor.

371
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,560
If she doesn't follow the rules,

372
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,880
she will have a lot of suffering ahead.

373
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,560
Moreover, no matter how arrogant one is,

374
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,720
as long as she has to drink and eat,
she'll eventually bow down.

375
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,880
Jealous.

376
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,840
I know what you are thinking.

377
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,920
Don't try to hide it from me,
or I'll tell her.

378
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,400
I am not afraid of her.

379
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,680
My lady, don't.

380
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,080
My lady.

381
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,200
- My lady, please spare me.
- Fine.

382
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,920
Who is waiting there to be fed by you?

383
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,760
The entire Yang family doesn't regard me
as a person, right?

384
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,240
Good.

385
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,840
Even a maid dares to bully me.

386
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,800
My lady, please spare me. I'm sorry.

387
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,720
My lady, we are given to you
by Madam Yang.

388
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,160
Please be decent and show mercy.

389
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,120
Even if the Queen Mother is here,
I'll still beat you.

390
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,320
Pick up the food box and come with me,
or I'll break your legs.

391
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,800
Wang.

392
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,360
The young master has ordered
to add a few more dishes for lunch.

393
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,080
Duck and stir-fried chicken

394
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,720
Gourd soup with fresh lamb.

395
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,400
And a portion of cream pastry.

396
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,200
Okay, just make the order.

397
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,040
Did you all hear that?
Be more efficient, everyone.

398
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,880
What are you doing?
Hurry up and get to work.

399
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,320
You are the young master's
newly wedded wife, right?

400
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,520
The kitchen here
is full of smoke and fire,

401
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,920
not a place for someone
as delicate and noble as you.

402
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,280
It would break the rules.

403
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,520
Do you have any orders?
Let's talk outside.

404
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,760
I married into the Yang family properly
in a sedan chair carried by eight.

405
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,480
A maid like you is in no place to call me.

406
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,560
My Li family is just
a family of commoners.

407
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,040
When all the helpers
and kitchen staff see me,

408
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,560
they would keep their voice and head down.

409
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,480
Royal family? Strict rules?

410
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,120
Even a housekeeper
dares to laugh at me without any respect.

411
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,720
Yesterday, Mother-in-law said
the Yang family is a household of manners.

412
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,280
Yet the next day, you do the opposite.

413
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,200
As the newlywed lady,

414
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,800
I must correct all your manners.
Slap your face yourself.

415
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,280
My lady, I am so sorry.

416
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,880
I will not dare
give you plain food again.

417
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,800
I deserve punishment.

418
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,040
This one, this one, and this one.

419
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,760
Bring them to my room.

420
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,800
And bring up a pot of green plum wine.

421
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,440
A plate of beef as well.

422
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,080
Yes.

423
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,480
Where is Master Yang hosting the banquet?

424
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,880
Master Yang, what I said was just a joke.

425
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,080
I fear my serious words may annoy you.

426
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,200
I've heard

427
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,360
this Li family from Luoyang
may not be considered wealthy,

428
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,920
but all the daughters have been
carefully cultivated from a young age.

429
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,360
Do you know why?

430
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,120
Why?

431
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,280
Madam Li
keeps a group of performers in her shop

432
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,800
to attract scholars and young talents.

433
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,160
But secretly, she uses
her beautiful daughters as bait

434
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,880
to win over those wealthy men

435
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,400
in order to climb high
and get to know the nobles.

436
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,480
Some said…

437
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,080
What?

438
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,560
They said the Sifu House
is a hangout for prostitutes,

439
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,600
in private, engaging
in all those indecent activities.

440
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,080
Even those beautiful Li women

441
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,480
are dealing with something indecent.

442
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,800
Otherwise,
given the Li family's meager assets,

443
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,920
how could they marry
into wealthy Bianjing families?

444
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,080
Shut up.

445
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,520
Master Yang, the Li family
is of a humble origin.

446
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,080
They would do anything to climb high.

447
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,560
Seduce men and sell daughters.
These are nothing serious to them.

448
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,760
You've married her.
Don't take it to heart.

449
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,040
If you're tired of her, just divorce her

450
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,680
and marry someone better afterwards.

451
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,920
Anyone would be
a hundred times better than them.

452
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,640
You are such a vile and base person.

453
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,600
How dare you spread rumors about me?

454
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,000
You are so rude.

455
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,560
Why are you here?

456
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,680
You?

457
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,400
Then it's you.

458
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,360
You dared to spread rumors.

459
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,120
You deserve a beating. Take it.

460
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,080
This stick is to beat you
for slandering my Li family.

461
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,720
This stick is to beat you
for insulting my mother.

462
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,960
This stick is to beat you
for defaming the reputation of my sisters.

463
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,440
Take one more stick.

464
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,960
- No more.
- Who says so?

465
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,880
And you dared to advise others to divorce.

466
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,680
- Fine.
- Master Yang, save me.

467
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,960
Fine.

468
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,160
This dirty tongue
that spreads rumors and causes trouble…

469
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,840
Come on. Let me cut it off.

470
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,920
Apologize to my wife now.

471
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,840
All of you come out.

472
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,280
You, on the artificial hill,
come down now.

473
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,360
Master Yang, save me.

474
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,760
Apologize.

475
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,120
Lady Li, it's all my fault
for having such a dirty tongue.

476
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,000
Lady Li, you are magnanimous.
I'll never talk behind your back anymore.

477
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,240
- Never.
- Never.

478
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,040
I'll never slander the Li family again.
Never.

479
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,120
How bold you are.

480
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,480
You've forgotten Master Shen,
my fourth brother-in-law, right?

481
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,240
The son of Dali Supreme Court's Minister

482
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,680
broke the law and got beheaded by him.

483
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,840
You fools

484
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,920
are spreading rumors, tarnishing
the reputation of officials' relatives.

485
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,520
You should all be sentenced by hanging.

486
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,360
If you dare again to spread rumors
and slander others,

487
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,680
it'd be a mercy to send you
to Kaifeng Court for imprisonment.

488
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,040
Might as well slit open your belly
and chop up your heart.

489
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,280
It's so worth it for me, you four.

490
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,480
I am a man, and I don't fight with women.
That's why I suffered.

491
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,040
You guys…

492
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,720
- didn't save me.
- I…

493
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,840
You just watched me
getting beaten by that shrew, hiding.

494
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,480
I was about to save you.

495
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,280
But then I saw her charging at me,

496
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,440
I got dizzy,

497
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,200
and my knees went weak.

498
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,600
Master Yang, you have to discipline her.

499
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,320
I told you that you need to avoid her
when you see her.

500
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,160
You three got caught by her.

501
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,920
Remember.

502
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,040
As long as Lady Li remains my wife,

503
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,000
I won't allow anyone to bully her.

504
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,160
I wouldn't have let you off without
a beating today if she didn't do it.

505
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,720
Why did she say "you four"?

506
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,680
Li Leshan, stop there.

507
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,880
SPRING BREEZE AND AUTUMN MOON

508
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,880
Li Leshan, stop there.

509
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,160
Li Leshan.

510
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,080
Li Leshan, don't think I'll have no way
to deal with you.

511
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,960
I dared to marry you,
and I have ways to manage you.

512
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,960
Just now, I didn't fight back
because you're a woman.

513
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,920
If you dare to make a scene again
and provoke me,

514
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,160
I…

515
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,360
I'll tear down this door, tie you up,

516
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,320
and send you back to the Li's
with gongs ringing.

517
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,120
By then, it won't just be you
who's shamed,

518
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,560
I'll charge your mother
for not disciplining her daughter

519
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,040
and letting her commit violence.

520
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,360
Open the door.

521
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,640
- Pour the wine.
- Open the door.

522
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,400
Open the door,
then everything will be fine.

523
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,520
Li Leshan, open the door.

524
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,160
Qiansheng, order someone
to break down the door.

525
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,840
Yes.

526
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,040
Mother, sister.

527
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,440
Mother, you've seen it.

528
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,320
This new bride has quite a temper.

529
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,280
She dares to give her husband
the cold shoulder.

530
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,360
- I'll go ask her to open the door.
- No need.

531
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,080
All of you watch. I'll ask her
to open the door myself.

532
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,520
If she still doesn't open the door,

533
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,040
she's disrespecting her elders,
committing a crime of disobedience.

534
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,840
When I sue her in court,

535
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,240
it will be a disgrace and humiliation
for the Li family.

536
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,160
If she gets strokes at court,

537
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,920
her mother will have nothing so say

538
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,040
but thank me
for disciplining her daughter.

539
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,640
Mother.

540
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,840
Lady Li, what are you doing in there?

541
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,400
I just ordered someone
to prepare the wine and dishes.

542
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,280
I was about to send someone
to call for Xian.

543
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,320
I didn't hear anyone knocking at the door.

544
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,800
Sorry for keeping you waiting here.

545
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,440
May I know what's the matter?

546
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,200
Well said.

547
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,200
- Everyone knows what you did last night.
- Alright.

548
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,520
Mother, sister.

549
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,720
I don't need others
to care about my affairs.

550
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,560
You two just go back.

551
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,320
Li Leshan, you come with me.

552
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,520
How can you talk to us like that?

553
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
We are here for you.

554
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,960
BRIGHT AUTUMN MOON AND WARM SPRING BREEZE

555
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,040
Mother.

556
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,680
- You all may leave.
- Yes.

557
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,160
You messed up the banquet.

558
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,520
And I'm still hungry.

559
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,040
Your family is full of servants and maids.

560
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,720
You have enough servants.

561
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,720
Why did you insist on marrying me,

562
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,280
instead of the talented
and beautiful Yan girl that day?

563
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,000
You are just causing trouble for yourself.

564
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,640
Even if you don't fancy that Yan girl,

565
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,760
you could inform your parents
and marry another girl.

566
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,400
My family is only tea house owners.

567
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,120
We are not a match for your noble family.

568
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,040
Moreover, I don't tolerate anyone.

569
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,920
Today, I beat up your rascal friends.

570
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,080
Tomorrow, if anyone else
dares to do anything bad to me

571
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,280
and provokes me,

572
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,160
I'll not hesitate to beat them,
no matter who they are.

573
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,200
You will not have a day of peace
after our marriage.

574
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,720
Li Leshan, you are trying
to get me to divorce you, right?

575
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,760
Never.

576
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,200
- You!
- Even if I didn't marry that Lady Yan,

577
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,040
there will still be many others.

578
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,640
I don't want to marry
any lady my father chooses.

579
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,200
I like your wildness

580
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,160
and forthright behavior, which is
different from anyone from Yang's family.

581
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,800
I also like watching you beat others.

582
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,280
You can just beat those

583
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,840
who are vile and despicable.

584
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,520
So, you like me that much.

585
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,240
Then I will stay in the Yang family

586
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,920
to be a loving couple with you.

587
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,440
We stay together day and night.

588
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,240
You shall not regret it in the future.

589
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,240
Alright then, remember what you said.

590
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
Qiansheng.

591
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,200
Master.

592
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,000
Prepare the wedding candles
and wedding wine.

593
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,920
Get some more dishes.

594
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,080
I want to share a bridal cup of wine

595
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,440
with my wife.

596
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,600
Yes.

597
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,840
Wait.

598
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,480
First, have someone change
the ceramic pillow on the bed.

599
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,560
Yes, Master.

600
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,000
The left one is for Master,
the right is for Lady Li.

601
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,480
The right is for Lady Li. Remember it.

602
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,760
Well…

603
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,000
After drinking this cup of wine,
one feels weak and limp.

604
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,320
Can't even lift a wooden club.

605
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,480
How can you be so foolish?
Master Wang has already been beaten up.

606
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,400
So, our Master should take
some precautions in advance.

607
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,560
Alright, hurry.

608
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,920
Go.

609
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Remember it.

610
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,360
<i>If they get along well,</i>
<i>what good would it do me?</i>

611
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,960
<i>I can't let Lady Li get what she wants.</i>

612
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,280
- Master, I'll set the dishes for you.
- Leave.

613
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,800
Yes.

614
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,360
That day,

615
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,200
you were supposed to marry
into the He family,

616
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,880
yet you married into mine.

617
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,720
So, though we had our matches,
fate eventually brought us together.

618
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,440
I toast this to you.

619
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,600
From now on,
let's not mention anything about the past.

620
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,600
Let bygones be bygones.
I hope we will be a happy couple forever.

621
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,960
A mouse! There's a mouse in the room.

622
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,040
A mouse? Where is it?

623
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,440
I just saw it over there.

624
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,560
But I lost sight of it now.

625
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,480
You must have been mistaken.

626
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,600
Let's continue.

627
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,280
My apologies. Please pick it up.

628
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,680
Master, since you wish
to have a toast to our wedding,

629
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,560
then we must drink from the crossed cups
according to the ritual.

630
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,080
Here.

631
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,600
You are right.

632
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,080
Here.

633
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,720
My lady.

634
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,160
Master Yang is drunk.
Go in and take care of him.

635
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,720
Yes.

636
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,280
Well…

637
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,600
My lady, don't be mad.
Just tell us what you want to do,

638
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,240
then we'll do it.

639
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,760
That's right.

640
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,840
Get to work.

641
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,160
Li Leshan, what are you up to now?
Let me go.

642
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,520
What are you doing?

643
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,200
You…

644
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,600
What are you doing?

645
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,920
Someone!

646
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,120
Someone!

647
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,200
Dear husband.

648
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,800
Normally, a couple

649
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,880
would do cliché things,
like drawing the eyebrow.

650
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,640
They don't know how to have fun like I do.

651
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,320
I'll let you experience
the unique joy and fun.

652
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,080
Li Leshan.

653
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,160
Go on. Louder.

654
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,120
Get everyone
in the Yang family to come.

655
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,400
Li Leshan. You!

656
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,440
I'm sure that your news of having fun

657
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,560
will spread
across the entire capital by tomorrow.

658
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,160
Li Leshan, just wait and see.

659
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,080
Master, this is the drug
you wanted yourself.

660
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,000
It's pretty strong.

661
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,960
What?

662
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,680
Don't you like it?

663
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,440
I can let you go.

664
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,720
Just promise me one thing.
Everything is negotiable.

665
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,200
Don't even think about it.

666
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,360
A rejection?

667
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,120
Good. You are bold.

668
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,400
What a great man

669
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,480
you are.

670
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,480
Tickle him.

671
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,080
Go on.

672
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,800
Yes or no?

673
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,280
You may leave.

674
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

675
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,920
Okay.

676
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,840
You say it.

677
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,920
What do you want me to do?

678
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,320
I want you to prepare a generous gift
and come with me to the Li's tomorrow.

679
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,480
That's easy.

680
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,080
Let me go.

681
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,320
I want you to do more than this.

682
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,240
You can't talk back or fight back
in front of others

683
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,080
to be a compliant and considerate husband.

684
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,960
How about it? Can you do it?

685
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,760
Yes.

686
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,240
Let go of me.

687
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,320
Among the six children my mother raised,

688
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,480
she pampers me the most.
If I don't live a happy life,

689
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,240
she might have trouble sleeping at night.

690
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,240
- If you do what I say…
- If you can't fall sleep…

691
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,760
…I will stop right here.

692
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,680
Otherwise…

693
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,720
Remember my preferences,

694
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,720
lest you get caught if someone asks you.

695
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,480
I love to eat sweet things
and dislike sour.

696
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,440
I hate Sichuan pepper and ginger the most.

697
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,960
How dare you try to sneak attack me?

698
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:02,360
Am I that despicable? Winning you over
won't be an unmerited victory.

699
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,200
I love bright blue, yellow, and red.
The more eye-catching, the more I love it.

700
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,440
I dislike white, black, and gray the most.

701
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,600
- So depressing to look at.
- White, black, and gray.

702
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,840
- How depressing!
- Depressing…

703
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,320
Just remember these two for now.

704
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,200
All the girls in my family
have different personalities,

705
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,080
and their husbands are also worlds apart.

706
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,640
Those four brothers-in-law of mine

707
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,440
are all extraordinary.

708
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,240
You must be careful.

709
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,200
I've told you not to sneak attack.

710
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,800
You fool.

711
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,560
Do you remember what I've told you?

712
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,560
I'm not stupid. I got it.

713
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,240
But I always feel like
I've forgotten something.

714
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,680
You've reminded me many times.

715
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,520
You just want me
to pretend to act submissive.

716
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,920
The Li family is not some dangerous place.
Why are you being so nervous?

717
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,520
Is it worth nagging me to death?

718
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,400
Li Leshan, remember this well.

719
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,880
I save you face today,

720
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,680
and you must return
the favor in the future.

721
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,160
Stop being violent.

722
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,560
It's embarrassing.

723
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,520
Wait.

724
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,440
What have I forgotten?

725
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,680
Let me think.

726
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,240
What have I forgotten?

727
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,040
You've forgotten this…

728
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,680
What are you doing?

729
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,520
I don't think it's appropriate

730
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,640
to take this back, right?

731
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,080
Oh my.

732
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,480
What have I forgotten?

733
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,640
