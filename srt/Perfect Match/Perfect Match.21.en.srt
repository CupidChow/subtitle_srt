EPISODE 21

2
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,520
Didn't I tell you
not to let anyone disturb me?

3
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,080
Master,

4
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,320
the old lady heard you were working late

5
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,920
and asked your wife
to bring this chicken soup.

6
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,680
He already had dinner.

7
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,280
Don't waste Granny's care.

8
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,760
Perfect. I'm feeling hungry.

9
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,960
I'll drink it.

10
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,160
You can't drink this.

11
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,760
What's in it?

12
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,360
Just beetles, snake bed seeds,

13
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,400
silkworm moths, and bull…

14
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,440
pizzle.

15
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,680
How do you know that?

16
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,760
My family sells fragrant medicine,

17
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,280
makes incense pills and cakes.

18
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,360
I'm often around the pharmacy,

19
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,520
so I recognized the smell.

20
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,560
Don't you want to stay here?

21
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,080
Why stop this?

22
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,920
I… Oh, your robe is untidy.

23
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,320
Let me fix it.

24
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,720
Open the door.

25
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,200
It's the old lady's order.
Please understand.

26
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,800
Yurui, this isn't right.

27
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,320
How can you lock the master in?

28
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,360
Outside the Shen house,

29
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,200
the master holds authority and respect,

30
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,600
but here, at home,

31
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,600
the old lady's word is absolute.

32
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,840
Stay here and behave.

33
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,720
Nonsense.

34
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,440
Granny meant well,

35
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,440
but if I just go along,
it feels like taking advantage.

36
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,080
I may be from a humble family,
but I have my pride.

37
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,560
I won't stoop to such tricks.

38
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,600
You sleep on the bed tonight.
I'll manage on the chair.

39
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,200
- Li Haode?
- I barely drank any of it.

40
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,960
Now I feel feverish.

41
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,960
Maybe I'm sick.

42
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,320
Don't believe me?

43
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,960
If you don't, then touch my forehead.

44
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,960
There's a cure, but get up first.

45
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,120
No, tell them to open the door now.

46
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,760
It's so stuffy in here. I need air.

47
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,520
Granny ordered no one

48
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,720
to open it until dawn.

49
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,320
Didn't you say there's a cure?
Where is it?

50
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,640
SCRIPTURE

51
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,440
Write these out tonight

52
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,320
and you'll be fine. Stay calm.

53
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,360
- You!
- Seem affected by the drug.

54
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,520
You won't sleep tonight.

55
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,960
Just take this chance to keep writing.

56
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
I'm off to bed.

57
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,880
It should go here.

58
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,720
Why do you smell of wine?

59
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,840
If I hadn't stepped in for your mom,

60
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,760
those guild folks would've kept pestering.

61
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,520
Even over tea prices, they made a fuss.

62
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,080
I meddled

63
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,280
but delayed coming home.

64
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,040
Who told you to play smart?

65
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,760
I want it to go here.

66
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,720
If I weren't smarter than you,

67
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,840
how could I bring you into my home?

68
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,480
You tricked me,

69
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,600
begged me over and over.

70
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,400
If I hadn't guessed
your mom's and your ways,

71
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,000
how would I dare lure you into my trap?

72
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,120
So, when you said you'd sail away,

73
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,800
was that also to test me?

74
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,800
- Chai An?
- Kangning.

75
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,520
- So, that's it.
- Kangning.

76
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,640
Kangning, Kangning.

77
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,600
My dear Kangning.

78
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,880
My--

79
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,680
Honey, listen to me.

80
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,640
What are you laughing at?

81
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,560
Honey, I'll get back to work.
I'll bring you a gift when I'm back.

82
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,880
I'm off now.

83
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,120
- Why not take a sedan chair?
- No need for that.

84
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,800
I'll walk off the alcohol.

85
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,800
So she won't hold it against me.

86
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,000
Where's the Mahāra I brought from Pan?

87
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,240
The one

88
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,440
with the red vest and small hat.

89
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,320
Kangning glanced at it twice
on the street yesterday.

90
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,760
You've bought her so many things already.
Maybe it got misplaced somewhere.

91
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,360
Can we just get another one?

92
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,200
Check Pan Restaurant.
It's probably still there.

93
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,360
Hurry, go now.

94
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,280
Wait here, sir. I'll be right back.

95
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,240
Hurry.

96
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,520
Murder!

97
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,480
He wants to kill me!

98
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,880
Please help me! Help!

99
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,600
He's the killer!

100
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,400
Save me!

101
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,880
He wants to kill me!

102
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,200
Alright, stop crying.

103
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,760
If not for your family's grand escort,

104
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,160
who'd bear this humiliation?

105
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,200
Granny didn't just bring soup.
She locked the door.

106
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,920
If I hadn't borrowed your couch,

107
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,440
I'd have frozen to death.

108
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,080
What kind of official are you?

109
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,000
What cases do you even handle?

110
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,320
Forcing me
to copy scriptures all night unfairly.

111
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,000
You'll crush people with injustice.

112
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,480
Li Haode,

113
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,040
ambition is admirable,

114
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,880
but it's wise to retreat from dead ends.

115
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,200
You've tried enough. It's time to let go.

116
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,000
For one year, we'll remain as a couple.

117
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,520
In private, we're like siblings.

118
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,880
When the year ends,

119
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,000
I'll find you a well-matched husband.

120
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,240
You'll be my adopted sister.

121
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,960
You'll marry with honor, alright?

122
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,280
- My lord.
- Call me brother. All cousins do.

123
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,000
- But brother--
- What?

124
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
- You still have hope?
- No.

125
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,360
- The old lady--
- That's my worry.

126
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,400
You don't need to fret about it.

127
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,920
The door's open.

128
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,920
Go back.

129
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,200
Come in.

130
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,080
Master, there was a murder last night.

131
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,920
Haode,

132
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,920
I dressed like this for you.

133
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You agreed too quickly. Is this fair?

134
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,640
We made a bet, remember? Either…

135
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,880
treat me as your elder sister.

136
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,280
Dream on.

137
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,920
That day won't come, little sister.

138
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,720
My lady, your family gives you a message.

139
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,920
They said
Master Chai was accused of murder.

140
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,440
- He's in jail now.
- Murder?

141
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,040
This is bad.

142
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,480
<i>Shouhua's away visiting family with Du.</i>

143
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,160
<i>They're not in the capital.</i>

144
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,800
<i>What do we do now?</i>

145
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,280
KAIFENG COURT

146
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,240
My lady, when my lord hears cases,
he never meets guests.

147
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,440
Not even family.

148
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,040
Tell him I'll wait in the side hall.

149
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,960
He'll finish eventually, right?

150
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,680
Shen Huizhao!

151
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,160
How can you punish blindly?

152
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,000
What kind of judge are you?

153
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,120
Chai.

154
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,280
Officials handling cases

155
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,960
can't be close relatives or in-laws.

156
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,120
This is the regulation.

157
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,640
This case should go to a higher court.

158
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,440
A fair decision will come.

159
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,840
I took this case and will be just.

160
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
I won't show favoritism.

161
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,280
You claim innocence in court,

162
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,560
but have no witnesses.

163
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,520
Twenty more lashes are due.

164
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,800
Only a few questions in,

165
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,160
and already the rod?

166
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,200
Shen Huizhao, you're a fool.

167
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,240
Hold the suspect for now.
We'll try the case later.

168
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,880
You shouldn't be here. Go home.

169
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,600
I've been to court. Why not the side hall?

170
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,720
How do you punish without inquiry?

171
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,480
We are related!

172
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,480
I'm not asking for leniency,
just no extra punishment.

173
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,840
Because of the Shen-Chai ties,

174
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,040
should it be worse?

175
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,440
Anyone linked to my family,

176
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,400
if guilty, gets harsher punishment

177
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,240
if I'm the judge.

178
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,400
Qingshi.

179
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,080
- Master.
- Ready a carriage for her.

180
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,080
Sure.

181
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,200
Brother!

182
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,800
Haode, we have no leads yet.

183
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,000
What do we do?

184
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,160
Leshan, listen to me.

185
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,760
Mom and Kangning
will be worried sick at home.

186
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,280
Go home and tell them
I'll figure something out.

187
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,240
Alright.

188
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,400
No need to say more.

189
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,320
That Madam Liu, she's the wife of Liu.

190
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
She said Chai was drunk and raped her.

191
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,000
Later, her husband caught them
and was killed by Chai.

192
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,840
Chai An has a big name.

193
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,760
He'd never do that.

194
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,600
Besides, Deqing only left briefly.

195
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,160
How could he commit such acts?

196
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,480
This isn't your concern.

197
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,120
No matter what, stay away from the court.

198
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,160
I can't ignore my brother-in-law's plight.

199
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,440
If you don't explain, I'll go tomorrow.

200
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,720
Days ago, I sentenced 12 criminals.

201
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
They were ruthless bandits.

202
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,440
Some escaped capture
due to poor enforcement.

203
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,760
When going out,
you should inform the old lady.

204
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,240
Take more people with you.

205
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,440
Stop rushing out alone.

206
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,000
But isn't it dangerous for you?

207
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,520
You can change your mind.

208
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,680
Take the divorce papers.
I'll keep my promise.

209
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
Never.

210
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,800
Why are you getting in my way?

211
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,440
Stay calm.

212
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,840
Step aside.

213
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,160
The horse is spooked!

214
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,160
Get out of the way!

215
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,280
Watch out!

216
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,280
Qingshi, what's going on?

217
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,880
Be careful!
The carriage is out of control!

218
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,720
Move!

219
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,720
Watch out! Hurry, move!

220
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,200
Master!

221
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,880
- Is anyone inside?
- Master!

222
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,840
Brother.

223
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,440
- Check on them.
- Brother.

224
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,200
Brother!

225
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,480
Don't scare me.

226
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,160
Brother!

227
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,520
Sir,

228
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,120
how's my grandson's condition?

229
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,240
When will he wake up?

230
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,320
Lady,

231
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,120
forgive my bluntness.

232
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,160
Head injuries

233
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,280
aren't cured with medicine.

234
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,040
In this case, even a miracle worker

235
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,880
wouldn't dare give a prognosis.

236
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,280
Let's wait for him to wake.

237
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,680
Please, do your best.

238
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,000
If he recovers,

239
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,000
I'll reward you greatly.

240
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,400
- Yingying!
- Yingying!

241
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,560
- Yingying!
- Stop right there!

242
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,080
Stop! Step back! Let me go!

243
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,120
Yingying, don't be scared.

244
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,320
Son, save Yingying!

245
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,200
Tell them to back off!

246
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,920
Son.

247
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,600
SHEN YINGYING

248
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,560
Dad!

249
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,800
Let her go. I'll agree to anything!

250
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,880
I'll make him release you now.

251
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,320
Son, are you listening?

252
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,160
- Yingying's scared.
- Let her go!

253
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,000
- I'll trade for her.
- Stop!

254
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,800
Who'd believe your lies?

255
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,320
Tell them all to back off! Let me go.

256
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,800
Back off!

257
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
Son.

258
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,000
You killed 12 people in Fengqiu County.

259
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,000
If I let you escape today,

260
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,920
how many more will die?

261
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,800
Anyone who retreats is an accomplice!

262
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,200
Son!

263
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,280
Fine, then we all die together!

264
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,880
- Yingying!
- Yingying!

265
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,960
<i>Son, your mother's grief</i>

266
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,720
<i>has caused her to fall ill.</i>

267
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,120
<i>Focus on work, not sorrow.</i>

268
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,200
<i>You don't deserve family.</i>

269
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,520
<i>I'll pretend you're not my son.</i>

270
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,200
Sir!

271
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,080
Oh my God!

272
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,200
- Old lady!
- Lady!

273
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,640
He has been unconscious for a full day.

274
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,280
To avoid keeping Granny's waiting,

275
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,640
please inform her.

276
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,000
I'll let her know once he wakes.

277
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,760
Tell her to rest easy.

278
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,840
Don't worry, my lady. Sure.

279
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,440
Mom knows. Kangning is on it.

280
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,440
He won't suffer much.

281
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,080
Brother.

282
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,680
You're awake!

283
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,760
How do you feel?

284
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,280
How do you feel?

285
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,840
Hao…

286
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,880
My lady.

287
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,480
Why does he seem… off?

288
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,560
Who…

289
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,840
Who are you?

290
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,520
My lady, is he…

291
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,400
Is he…?

292
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,040
Master.

293
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,040
This is your wife.

294
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,040
How could you forget her?

295
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,400
Honey.

296
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,440
I…

297
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,480
I don't know you.

298
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,520
Why would I lie to you?

299
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,320
You're so sick, you've forgotten me.

300
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,840
The physician's staying nearby.

301
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,920
I'll fetch him immediately.

302
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,840
Don't move around. You'll make it worse.

303
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,880
Leshan, let's go.

304
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,440
Oh no, Shen has turned into a fool.

305
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,560
Can the old lady handle this?
Will they let you off?

306
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,560
This isn't a big deal.

307
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,360
But Chai's case will be tried
by other judges.

308
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,320
Or get transferred.

309
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,800
Then, we'll have no way then.

310
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,280
But misfortune can bring opportunity.

311
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,240
For you, it's good news.

312
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,400
Good news?

313
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,680
If you can win him over,

314
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,880
you'll be a true Lady of the Shen family.

315
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,560
Don't miss this chance.

316
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,080
Do whatever it takes.

317
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,520
Don't slip up.

318
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,200
Du said before

319
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,000
the magistrate's position is tough.

320
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,720
He hasn't been officially appointed yet.

321
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,400
He's just acting as a stand-in.

322
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,240
His position isn't secure.

323
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,680
So what?

324
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,720
The people of Bianjing

325
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,520
want a fair and strict magistrate.

326
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,120
If he loses that seat because of me,

327
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,560
then I'd be to blame for it all.

328
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,840
That can't happen.

329
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,160
Yes, we're married,

330
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,520
but no temple visit.

331
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,920
You didn't want to marry me.

332
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,040
You saw me as a sister.
So, I called you brother.

333
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,960
Do you remember now?

334
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,400
You're overseeing Kaifeng
as acting governor.

335
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,480
You're an incorruptible and just official.

336
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,000
You're the third son of the Shen family.

337
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,800
With no brothers to help, you bear it all.

338
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,040
This attack injured your head severely.

339
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,960
Your servant Qingshi's leg was hurt too.

340
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,160
At least the bandits have been caught.

341
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,200
My silly sister.

342
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,280
Leshan, quick, get the physician.

343
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,520
Sure.

344
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,000
It's okay.

345
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,480
That's my real sister.

346
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,640
She disguised herself to stay by my side,

347
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,360
afraid I'd be mistreated by the Shens.

348
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,120
Brother, ask me anything.

349
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,280
I'll tell you everything I know.

350
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,200
But about your illness…

351
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,800
Granny's health isn't great.

352
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,800
Whether to tell the truth or not

353
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,080
depends on you.

354
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,400
My grandson.

355
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,440
Always making enemies with outlaws.

356
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,800
How can you ever have peace?

357
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,360
Better resign and quit being an official.

358
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,960
At least you won't come back

359
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,120
injured again.

360
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,040
How would I handle it next time?

361
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,600
I'd rather close my eyes for good.

362
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,280
Better than living in constant fear.

363
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,640
Granny, forgive me for worrying you.

364
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,680
I'm fine now, truly.

365
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,840
See?

366
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,760
Blessed people are always protected.

367
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,160
Just stay careful when you're out.

368
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,800
Don't let scoundrels take advantage.

369
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,680
<i>Look at him acting innocent.</i>

370
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,960
<i>He's better than me.</i>

371
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,560
- Tell me about the case.
- Okay.

372
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,840
Three nights ago,

373
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,440
my brother-in-law was passing
Tianshui Alley.

374
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,560
He was falsely accused.

375
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,560
Like this.

376
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,960
Remember?

377
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,880
Zhang Ping's wife, Liu,

378
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,760
accused him of drunken assault.

379
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,200
She said Zhang caught him, they fought,

380
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,800
and Zhang fell out and died.

381
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,400
But here's the strange part.
Only two people were there.

382
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,440
Why not question Zhang's wife?

383
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,320
Why only beat your brother-in-law?

384
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,400
You told them to beat him. I don't know.

385
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,960
- You know why.
- Me?

386
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,560
What? You really don't remember?

387
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,880
In this situation,

388
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,120
how can we hide this from Granny and Dad

389
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,520
and let you preside over this case?

390
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,280
Let me think more on it.

391
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,040
I heard Shen got hurt. Is it serious?

392
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,280
What about Chai's case?

393
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,440
Tell me. What is he going to do about it?

394
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,880
Mom, just minor injuries. He's fine.

395
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,920
As for the case, he'll handle it.

396
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,840
No need to worry.

397
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,320
- I--
- Haode.

398
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,480
- You're here.
- Kangning.

399
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,400
Kangning.

400
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,160
Does Chai have a royal pardon document?

401
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,800
Ca-can it save a life?

402
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,520
Mom, he didn't kill anyone.

403
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,880
No need to worry, okay?

404
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,480
- Don't worry, Mom.
- I don't.

405
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,400
How is this?

406
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,120
What happened exactly?

407
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,200
Chai told me

408
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,240
Shen didn't even ask any questions first
but hit him directly.

409
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,360
He's afraid of being accused
of favoritism.

410
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,680
He's not like the old strict Judge Shen.

411
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,200
Your brother-in-law found it odd,

412
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,520
so he went along and took the punishment.

413
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,440
He wants you to find him

414
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,040
and ask him what's really going on.

415
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,040
<i>He does have calculation,</i>

416
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,040
<i>but he doesn't remember anything.</i>
<i>What should I say?</i>

417
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,640
Kangning, I admire you so much.

418
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,000
Even in such chaos, you stay calm.

419
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,080
If he's not panicking, I shouldn't either.

420
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,160
Haode, let's sort this out together.

421
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,120
Come, sit. We'll figure this out.

422
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,680
KAIFENG COURT

423
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,120
Summon the plaintiff, Liu,

424
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,360
and the defendant, Chai An.

425
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,520
How could Chai An

426
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,160
carry a grappling hook home?

427
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,880
It was late night. All doors were shut.

428
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,840
Why was your window wide open?

429
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,280
Did you let him climb in through the wall?

430
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,880
My lord.

431
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,560
I don't know why he had a grappling hook.

432
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,440
I was ill

433
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,160
and opened the window for air.

434
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,920
He got mad and knocked me out

435
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,160
when I caught him sneaking in.

436
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,440
When I woke up, my husband was dead.

437
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,360
No one else was there.
Who else could it be?

438
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,360
I'm just a widow seeking justice
despite shame.

439
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,080
It's clear he killed my husband.

440
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,800
Yet you question me

441
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,280
instead of punishing him?

442
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,120
Are you favoring him?

443
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,680
We've never met.

444
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,840
Why lie to harm me?

445
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,040
Even to death?

446
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
My lord.

447
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,000
I passed by the Zhang house,

448
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,760
and he was dead.

449
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,920
How do we know
she and her lover didn't do it?

450
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,800
Who'd dare fake such a serious accusation?

451
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,000
It's about life. Who would fake it?

452
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,400
I never leave the house

453
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,840
and follow the rules.
Everyone knows my reputation.

454
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,080
My lord.

455
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,880
He's not just a killer

456
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,080
but also slanders me.

457
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,600
If you don't punish him,

458
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,880
it's clear favoritism.

459
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,320
I'm a widow but won't stand it.

460
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,120
If I can't get justice here,
I'll go higher.

461
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,640
The Ministry of Justice will hear my case.

462
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,800
If you refuse fairness,

463
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,200
I'll die right here.

464
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,440
I'll cause an uproar.

465
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,520
If you protect the guilty

466
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,040
and help your relatives,

467
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,360
you'll face the law.

468
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,320
Losing your title is the least.

469
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,920
You could be exiled.

470
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,320
Are you willing to risk that?

471
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,840
Liu, one more false word

472
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,680
and I'll charge you

473
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,480
with court contempt.

474
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,800
Chai An, did you hear that?

475
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,680
She insists you're the killer.

476
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,360
Her words are quite convincing.

477
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,080
If you don't confess,
I'll have to use force.

478
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,960
You only care about your title

479
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,560
and your officialdom.

480
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,200
But what about an innocent life?

481
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,160
Shen Huizhao,

482
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,480
how ironic.

483
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,680
Letting a woman manipulate you like this?

484
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,600
I didn't kill anyone.

485
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,680
Beat me to death if you want.
I won't confess.

486
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:24,800
Fine. Let's see how tough you really are.

487
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,440
Guards, give him 30 strokes.

488
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,240
Shen Huizhao,

489
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,560
you're ruining lives with torture.

490
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,200
Injustice! I'll die unjustly!

491
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,120
Injustice!

492
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,920
Shen Huizhao.

493
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,320
My lord, he was already beaten

494
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,760
- in the last trial.
- You wronged me.

495
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,800
His wounds are severe.

496
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,640
One more hit could kill him.

497
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,200
Are you sure?

498
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,360
Don't stop.

499
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,000
Beat him until he confesses.

500
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,680
Injustice!

501
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,800
- Shen Huizhao has truly lost his way.
- You wronged me.

502
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,880
Afraid of favoritism, he's gone too far.

503
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,080
Haode, Chai An just took a beating.

504
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,680
If this keeps up,

505
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,120
even ten lives won't save him.

506
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,040
Don't worry.

507
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,160
- He knows his limits.
- You wronged me.

508
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,240
Limits?

509
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,880
He's cold and ruthless, famous for it.

510
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,120
Haode, you married him.

511
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,760
Does your heart follow him?

512
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,920
Forget your family?

513
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,600
Fine! I won't meddle anymore.

514
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,240
Let's see how you tell Kangning.

515
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,520
Haode.

516
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,280
Even if I die

517
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,480
and fall into hell,

518
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,800
I won't let you go, Shen Huizhao!

519
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,400
Shen Huizhao!

520
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,160
My lord, he couldn't endure the torture.

521
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,840
He bit his tongue and killed himself.

522
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,160
- Really?
- Exactly.

523
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,200
He was only questioned three times.

524
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,840
The beating didn't reach 200 strokes.

525
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,280
You all saw it. I wasn't being cruel.

526
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,280
The suspect took his own life in fear.

527
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,000
Exactly, 30 strokes can't kill a man.

528
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,080
He died to escape his guilt.

529
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,200
Though he didn't confess,

530
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,560
evidence is clear.
There's no way to deny his crime.

531
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,720
Since he died guilty,

532
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,720
inform his family.
Let them claim his body.

533
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,160
As for the details of the case,

534
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,000
Liu's testimony will be recorded in full.

535
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,880
Everything related to the case,

536
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,880
I'll submit them to the court.

537
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,720
Once approved, the case will close.

538
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,840
Thank you for your fairness.

539
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,480
You're a beacon of justice.

540
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,200
My husband can rest in peace now.

541
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,640
I heard Mr. Shen's an honest official.

542
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,360
Indeed, he's a man of great principle.

543
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,200
My testimony is enough
to close this case, right?

544
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,800
Don't worry.
Once it's approved, it's over.

545
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,080
Chai An.

546
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,720
Chai An.

547
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,400
Chai An.

548
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,720
You…

549
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,240
You!

550
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,560
How could you leave me all alone?

551
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,560
How am I supposed to go on now?

552
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,040
You were such an upright man.

553
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,640
How could fate deal you this blow?

554
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,320
If your spirit lingers, bring justice.

555
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,200
Punish those who made you a scapegoat.

556
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,760
Take an innocent as a scapegoat.

557
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,920
Another life taken by her hands.

558
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,480
Heaven won't let her go so easily.

559
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,000
Justice will find its mark in time.

560
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:26,240
No one escapes the wheel of karma.

561
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,600
Exactly. That's why karma is after him.

562
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,960
If you dare speak ill again,

563
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,560
heaven will punish you.

564
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,440
KAIFENG COURT

565
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,760
Hurry inside.

566
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,200
Why are you so late?

567
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,840
Did you miss me?

568
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,400
- Lock the door once we're inside.
- Hurry.

569
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,560
- Seize them.
- What are you doing?

570
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,720
- Why are you arresting me?
- Take them.

571
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,720
Do you even know who I am?

572
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,960
I remember your face!

573
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,320
Let me go!

574
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,200
Kangning.

575
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,240
Eat something. He's gone.

576
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,240
Kangning, this is too big to keep secret.

577
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,640
A funeral must happen.

578
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,600
Let's return him to the Chai family.

579
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,040
His mom will know eventually.

580
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,040
My son-in-law,

581
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,200
such a fine man he was.

582
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,920
Gone just like that, out of nowhere.

583
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
What grudge does the Shen family hold?

584
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,400
Why help outsiders to harm us so?

585
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,240
Now my daughter's a widow for no reason!

586
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,400
Damn it all.

587
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,000
Haode's a heartless girl.

588
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,560
When Haode returns, I'll break her legs!

589
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,120
Kangning, congratulations!

590
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,320
Are you out of your mind?

591
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,200
Her husband just died
and you congratulate her?

592
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,080
His grave's not even settled
and you're already talking remarriage?

593
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,560
What nonsense are you saying?

594
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,600
Mom, what are you talking about?

595
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,080
Enough.

596
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,040
The court caught Liu's lover.

597
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,960
They interrogated him overnight.
He's already confessed everything.

598
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,200
Confessed?

599
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,080
My good son-in-law.

600
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,720
If you'd been a day later…

601
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,400
They've caught him!

602
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,480
Honey.

603
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,120
Did you hear that? They got him!

604
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,800
Honey, am I right?

605
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,000
Justice prevails.

606
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,040
I'm blessed, and the truth is out.

607
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,680
How was my performance in court?

608
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,520
Why did you pick up that relic?
It brought us so much trouble.

609
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,800
Of course, I had to pick it up.

610
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,400
It's what brought us together.
Can't lose it.

611
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,920
You!

612
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,640
And you guys!

613
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,080
- Mom!
- Madam!

614
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,320
- Wake up! Madam!
- Mother!

615
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,240
Mom!

616
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,520
- Mom.
- Are you alright?

617
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,160
Both of them confessed?

618
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,280
Liu refused to admit it.

619
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,160
But Wangsheng couldn't endure the torture.

620
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,000
By morning, he confessed everything.

621
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,240
Turns out they were meeting in secret.

622
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,920
Zhang Ping accidentally caught them.

623
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,240
They fought,

624
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,640
and Zhang Ping fell.

625
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,480
So, my brother-in-law is innocent?

626
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,840
How did you figure this out?

627
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,120
I planned this during the first trial.

628
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,880
You're a great officer.

629
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,880
Forty strokes after one session.

630
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,400
There had to be a reason.

631
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,520
With no witnesses, Liu denied everything.

632
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,800
If she never admitted it,

633
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,880
this case would stay unsolved.

634
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,760
So, you had to lure her out
and then do the trick.

635
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,120
Well, am I clever or not?

636
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,440
Sure.

637
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,520
Actually, my sister's even smarter.

638
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,200
She just refused to trust you at first.

639
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,760
Good thing I convinced her.

640
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,880
This case was way too easy.

641
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,200
Honestly, I could've handled it myself.

642
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,640
<i>So, he loves sweets, huh?</i>

643
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,840
Brother,

644
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,320
you might not remember much.

645
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,600
But with me around,
you'll never blow your cover.

646
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,480
What if he kept denying everything?

647
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,400
This case was simple. You got lucky.

648
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,480
If you faced something tougher…

649
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,440
In my current state, it'd be hard.

650
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,360
Hard or not, it has to be done.

651
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,040
The Li family case dragged for years.

652
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,240
They said family disputes were tricky.

653
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,000
It stretched on year after year.

654
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,840
My mom grew terrified of officials.

655
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,320
If only we'd met

656
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,760
someone like you earlier,

657
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,720
we wouldn't have had to leave home.

658
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,320
Brother. As an official, stay just.

659
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,280
Losing your position isn't a big deal.

660
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,360
But if some fools take over,

661
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,600
how can common people live?

662
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,440
Enough of this.

663
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,880
The physician said
your injuries take time.

664
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,240
You can't get better so soon.

665
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,080
Leave this case to the magistrates.

666
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,040
Take time to recover.
That's your priority now.

667
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,560
