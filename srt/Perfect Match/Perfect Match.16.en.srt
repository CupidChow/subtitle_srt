00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,200
EPISODE 16

2
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,440
I want one.

3
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,920
I want one.

4
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,840
I also want one.

5
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,240
I want this one.

6
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,200
I want this one.

7
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,520
You know how to do it.

8
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,400
Yes.

9
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,320
Is it strange?

10
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,120
Is it still the case
of throwing up whatever you eat?

11
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,040
Much better now.

12
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,000
Now I realize
how hard it is to be a mother.

13
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,840
This child hasn't even been born yet.

14
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,560
It really gives me a tough time.

15
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,640
But you mustn't be naughty.

16
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,640
Mother raised the six of us.

17
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,200
I don't know how she raised us all.

18
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,440
Think about Leshan when she was little.

19
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,800
She was simply a monkey,

20
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,800
reckless without any concern.
Even tigers would run away seeing her.

21
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,280
Is eldest brother-in-law going to
be named an official soon?

22
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,000
Calculating the time,

23
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,600
it won't be delayed till after June.

24
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,600
New Jinshi
is usually assigned to posts outside.

25
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,240
Shouhua, have you thought it through?

26
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,400
Do you go with him, or does he go first,
then invite you to join him?

27
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,640
I'm hoping he gets assigned
somewhere closer,

28
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,480
so that we are not separated for too long.

29
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,000
Shouhua.

30
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Shouhua.

31
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,520
- Hairpin flowers.
- Are they all sold out?

32
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,560
The materials are all the latest fashion
from the Fan family's shop.

33
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,240
Others simply
aren't willing to spend this much.

34
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,200
All sold out,
snatched up by a single family.

35
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,800
The messenger also said

36
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,680
their master has a passion for flowers

37
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,280
and he wants to buy a batch

38
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,520
of hairpin flowers of peonies
and autumn chrysanthemums.

39
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,000
They also sent an invitation to Shouhua
for the Summer Flower Gathering,

40
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,120
asking us to go together.

41
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,320
Whose family is it?

42
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,880
I think it's

43
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,000
the house of the Ministry of Personnel
who participates in political affairs.

44
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,960
Yes, it's the young lady of the Yu family.

45
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,600
The Yu family?
Is the Yu family very impressive?

46
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,840
What is a Summer Flower Gathering?

47
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,200
Are we going or not?

48
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,960
I heard Minister Yu was a top scholar
when he entered government service.

49
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,320
He's been in office for 20 years.

50
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,680
He worries about the country,
loves the people, and is honest.

51
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,480
Among the people,
he has a very good reputation,

52
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,960
and the ability to recognize talent.

53
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,920
He's recommended many
for government service.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,280
- Mr. Du respects him as a teacher.
- Don't muck about.

55
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,080
The women of his family
delivered an invitation.

56
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,360
It wouldn't be good to decline.

57
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,680
The Summer Flower Festival
is a grand event in Bianjing.

58
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,320
It's organized by the royal family
and high-ranking officials.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,200
For ordinary officials and their families,
an invitation is hard to come by.

60
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,080
It's a rare opportunity.

61
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,200
It seems we must make an appearance

62
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,280
and pay a personal visit to Miss Yu.

63
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,320
My lady, don't you like wearing hairpins?

64
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,840
This one compared to that one

65
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,120
is heavier in gold,

66
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,640
with larger and brighter pearls.

67
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,560
This was personally selected by me,
hoping to capture my lady's heart.

68
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,360
Today's flower-viewing feast

69
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,360
would be more fitting
with a hairpin with flowers.

70
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,280
My lady,

71
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,800
I'll accompany you to the feast.

72
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,600
The flower-viewing feast
is only for ladies from each household.

73
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,600
When was Mr. Du invited?

74
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,240
Then, I'll take you there.

75
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,560
I have sisters to accompany me.

76
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,000
No need to trouble my dear husband.

77
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,120
Runyue.

78
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,600
Runyue.

79
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,360
My lady.

80
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,800
I accidentally

81
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,960
burned a hole in the new dress.

82
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,200
What?

83
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,080
Quickly, let me see.

84
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,240
Are you hurt?

85
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,400
I've told you to be careful when you work.
Still, you are clumsy and reckless.

86
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,680
This is the dress you had made

87
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,800
especially for the feast.

88
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,320
Now it's been ruined by the burn.

89
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,920
What are we going to do now?

90
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,080
- I…
- As long as you are not burnt, it's fine.

91
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,200
The sisters are arriving soon.

92
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,160
Go get ready quickly.

93
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,640
My lady, are you still going?

94
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,400
But ladies of your household
all love to look beautiful.

95
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,200
If they don't have new clothes,

96
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,000
they'd rather not go out.

97
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,840
I'm afraid

98
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,640
others will laugh at my lady.

99
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,120
I'm not afraid of being laughed at.

100
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,440
No need to make new ones.

101
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,520
It's just the sisters
making a fuss over nothing.

102
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,720
I feel this old garment

103
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,040
is quite comfortable.

104
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,080
Go ahead.

105
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,760
Yes.

106
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,280
What's wrong?

107
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
Nothing.

108
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,320
My lord, you go ahead with your affairs.

109
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,800
I must also hurry to the feast.

110
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,320
The imperial family will open

111
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,880
the Jinming Pool every March

112
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,280
- for people in Bianjing to enjoy.
- Haode, look at me.

113
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,400
- Usually, the pond will close after April.
- Is it pretty?

114
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,480
In June, Consort Yang
celebrates her birthday in the palace.

115
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,240
Hearing that the golden lotuses
in the pond are blooming vigorously,

116
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,240
she especially implored His Majesty
for a decree of grace,

117
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,520
allowing the gentry and commoners
to enjoy it for a month.

118
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,640
Thus, the flower appreciation event
has been set here.

119
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,040
Many thanks to Lady Yu for the invitation.

120
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,040
Then we have the opportunity
to come and enjoy it.

121
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,720
I am a bit stubborn in my personality.

122
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,120
I'm only willing to meet those
whom I agree to.

123
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,040
Those fools with vulgarity about them,

124
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,800
even a glance,

125
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,720
can make me feel troubled in my heart.

126
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,560
Ever since meeting you,

127
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,040
I feel you are gentle and amiable,

128
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,400
and I'm very fond of you in my heart.

129
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,120
Yesterday, I also heard my father say

130
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,960
that His Majesty
particularly favors Mr. Du

131
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,920
and intends to keep him in the capital.

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,280
It seems that we must

133
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,480
often come and go.

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,960
Chuanfang.

135
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,600
Look,

136
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,640
this flower hairpin

137
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,720
is indeed exquisitely made by your shop.

138
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,480
I tried to imitate it
but can never do it right.

139
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,440
Today, I was thinking of your arrival.
I sincerely ask for your guidance.

140
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,680
Please, don't hold back on me.

141
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,000
Kangning.

142
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,360
This lotus seed wine,
why aren't you drinking?

143
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,720
I brewed this myself.

144
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,520
Let me tell you secretly,

145
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,680
this wine is better than

146
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,080
the flower wine they are drinking.

147
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,000
Thank you for your kind intentions,
Lady Yu.

148
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,760
There's no need for such formalities.

149
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,200
Just call me Xiu'e.

150
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,040
Kangning,

151
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,200
tell Leshan and the others

152
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,320
not to play by the water.

153
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,520
If they wet their shoes and catch a cold,
they'll get scolded when we return.

154
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,400
Look at this painting sketch of mine.

155
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,240
It just lacks spirit and charm.

156
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,440
It has form, but no soul,

157
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,440
and doesn't look real at all.

158
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,880
Where exactly did I go wrong?

159
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,760
I'm afraid Lady Yu's mind

160
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,000
is not on the painting

161
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,160
but on the person.

162
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,760
Good.

163
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,040
So, it was you indeed.

164
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,440
Cousin, why did you tie him up
and bring him here?

165
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,400
In the previous case
involving the Cui family,

166
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,320
they understood
my mother-in-law's temperament clearly.

167
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,480
She would protect her son-in-law
and dare not to report to the authorities.

168
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,200
We had to be subjected to their extortion.

169
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,440
The more I thought about it,
the more it seemed wrong.

170
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,520
Those two women from the Cui family
didn't even know about the law,

171
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,560
how could they
have plotted against the Li family?

172
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,720
Even if they really had
the capability and the audacity,

173
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,160
who would have been so coincidental

174
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,440
to leave behind
a bloodied garment as evidence?

175
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,120
Yan, it was you who harmed others
behind their backs again.

176
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,280
I promised my wife
not to cause trouble anymore.

177
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,640
Consider yourself lucky today.

178
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,440
Cousin, have him escorted
to the government office

179
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,400
and accuse him
of conspiring with the Cui family.

180
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,440
Untie him.

181
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,240
No, absolutely not.

182
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,040
This matter
must not be known to outsiders.

183
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,240
Whatever you want, I can give it.

184
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,880
When it comes down to it,
I too was compelled by circumstances.

185
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,120
- I didn't want to harm the Li family.
- Who forced you?

186
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,160
If you can't say it now,
you will at the Yamen.

187
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,760
Speak.

188
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,960
How so?

189
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,080
Today, I sent you

190
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,000
an invitation.

191
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,640
Is there anything wrong?

192
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,440
What you sent, I fear,

193
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,200
is not just an invitation,

194
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,560
but her.

195
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
My lady.

196
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,600
- My lady.
- Li Shouhua.

197
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,640
Ever since Chou'er entered your Du family,

198
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,920
I have never met her again,

199
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,160
nor have I ever sent her a message.

200
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,560
Then how did you come to know?

201
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,400
<i>The scent of the incense is so strong.</i>

202
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,480
<i>Last night, it was already ironed.</i>

203
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,600
<i>Why iron it again this morning?</i>

204
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,600
Just now, when I entered the garden,

205
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,440
the maid was holding madam's beloved dog.

206
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,960
It barked fiercely at me.

207
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,880
Yet it fell silent

208
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,920
upon seeing Runyue.

209
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,840
It shows she is no stranger.

210
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,840
That's when I became suspicious.

211
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,480
What a useless maid.

212
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,560
Why blame her?

213
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,960
The giveaway you showed
is far from the only one.

214
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,720
I would like to hear the details.

215
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,040
Even for a flower hairpin,

216
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,360
you had to invite the world's best artisan

217
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,120
to create a one-of-a-kind piece.

218
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,120
How could you tolerate
that all the women in Bianjing

219
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,400
are wearing the same flower?

220
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,680
So, you lured me out on purpose.

221
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,680
My third sister is a person
with meticulous attention to detail.

222
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,080
She always doubted
the case with the Cui family.

223
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,160
So, I had to give it more thought.

224
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,160
Lady Cui met Yan Zimei by chance.

225
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,160
How'd she know
he wouldn't return to the capital?

226
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,520
Could she be at ease making this scheme

227
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,120
without fear of being exposed?

228
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,000
Unless they were in cahoots
from the start.

229
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,480
Perhaps someone has been plotting
against the Li family,

230
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,680
waiting for a long-awaited opportunity.

231
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,040
They accidentally discovered
the Cui family's murder secret.

232
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,760
Only then did they set up this scheme.

233
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,960
But I've been thinking it over.

234
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,280
I don't know
who the Li family has offended

235
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,840
to go to such great lengths.

236
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,600
No.

237
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,560
You're wrong.

238
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,560
The reason I did this

239
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,960
was just to test a person.

240
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,600
Who?

241
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,600
Du Yangxi.

242
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,680
A man, who at the brink of life and death,

243
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,480
would abandon his wife and family,

244
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,000
is merely talented without virtue.

245
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,000
Just a selfish opportunist
not worth your devotion.

246
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,920
Therefore,

247
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,920
while I hope he helps the Li family,

248
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,160
I also want to see exactly how he helps.

249
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,880
Fortunately,

250
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,840
he did not disappoint me.

251
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,920
That day, when I saw him

252
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,800
<i>parading on horseback through the streets,</i>

253
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,160
<i>I fell for him at first sight.</i>

254
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,520
<i>Later, I saw him</i>
<i>from a distance a few times,</i>

255
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,000
and my feelings for him grew stronger.

256
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,400
I couldn't control myself.

257
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,280
I invited you today

258
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,080
because I want you to give him up.

259
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,680
We are already husband and wife.

260
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,240
Do you want me to divorce him?

261
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,280
Back then, you captured
the groom on the front of the list,

262
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
all for his one-time success on the exam.

263
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,720
You too, have the glory
of a husband and honor of a wife

264
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,920
with an imperial appointment.

265
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,120
But now that imperial appointment
is all but gone.

266
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,680
I can introduce you
to a noble from the royal family

267
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,480
to become the wife
of a prince in the future.

268
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,280
No need to abandon your lowly husband
and bring shame upon yourself.

269
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,120
There's no need to divorce and remarry.
Both sides will bear grudges.

270
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,480
But everyone will be happy.
Each one getting what they wish for.

271
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,680
It all depends on whether
you are willing or not.

272
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,200
What if I refuse?

273
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,520
What a lowly household the Li family is.

274
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,080
It's not up to you.

275
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,080
One must not
only think of oneself in everything.

276
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,200
One should also consider the best for
one's mother and sisters.

277
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,480
Kangning,

278
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,400
did I swing high on the swing just now?

279
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,000
High indeed.

280
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,040
Fortunately, mother had business
and didn't come.

281
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,320
Otherwise, she would've fainted seeing
you showing off in front of strangers.

282
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,040
This is nothing.

283
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,880
I remember when I was in Luoyang,

284
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,680
I snuck out to play in the river at night.

285
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,360
Nonsense.

286
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,720
- Shouhua.
- Don't ask. Hurry along.

287
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,760
Aren't we listening to music
and admiring the moon?

288
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,360
Just go. No need for prattle.

289
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,240
Go.

290
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,400
Alright, it's good to go back earlier too.

291
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,760
We can visit Fuhui on the way.

292
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,520
Hurry along.

293
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
I haven't had enough fun yet.

294
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,640
Stop playing, Shouhua is getting angry.

295
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,000
And you're still laughing?

296
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,960
At this time, you can still laugh?

297
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,800
Such strange things happen in this world.

298
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,840
In ancient times, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang
took possession of Lady Shou.

299
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,560
And now, Lady Yu
cunningly snatched Mr. Du.

300
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,600
Shouhua,

301
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,440
Mr. Du has very deep thoughts.

302
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,080
His scheming is deeper
than the waters of the Bian River.

303
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,480
You've tried several times
but still can't know his thoughts.

304
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,040
Such a cunning and heartless husband,

305
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,920
I gather you're not too fond of him.

306
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,800
Why not take this good opportunity

307
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,160
to swap him for a prince?

308
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,640
Are you insane?

309
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,320
How can you say such things?

310
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,000
You're asking for a beating.

311
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,680
If you want to swap, use your Mr. Chai.

312
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,280
Well, I wouldn't want to.

313
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,960
Who knows if the Yu family's

314
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,360
words count for anything.

315
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,840
I'm afraid they are spouting nonsense
and fooling people.

316
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,680
Then you won't be able to become princess
and lose the chance of marrying Mr. Du.

317
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,360
How come even you…?

318
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,400
Shouhua, you must be distressed.

319
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,200
That Yu Xiu'e acts perversely,

320
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,040
and you're making mischief with her,

321
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,800
mocking your own sister.

322
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,680
Fine.

323
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,400
Every single one of you,
see if I don't beat you.

324
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,560
- Why beat me?
- I'll beat you.

325
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,320
You should beat Kangning.

326
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,240
Shouhua promised not to beat me.

327
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,320
She hit me.

328
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
So what?

329
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,680
It's all you.

330
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,680
What are you thinking about?

331
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,480
A poor, humble scholar can form a marriage
alliance with a powerful family.

332
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,000
Isn't it 100 times better
than marrying a tea seller's daughter?

333
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,720
Shouhua,

334
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,040
you must never mention
this matter once at home.

335
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,120
Don't see Haode
as naive and straightforward.

336
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,560
When it comes to serious matters,

337
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,920
she's smarter than anyone else.

338
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,240
Wealth and riches dazzle the eyes.

339
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,240
Shouhua seems uninterested.

340
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,760
Perhaps he will be tempted.

341
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,280
Actually, I too want to know

342
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,160
what he will choose.

343
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,920
My lady.

344
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,320
My lord has returned.

345
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,760
It's late. Don't continue
with the embroidery work.

346
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,640
Tomorrow, find two maids to do it.

347
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,480
Lest you strain your eyes.

348
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
I'm not used to having
many people in the courtyard.

349
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,680
I don't like it.

350
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,440
My lord, tonight,

351
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,840
why have you returned so late?

352
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,280
I considered a lot.

353
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,440
With nothing to do,
I paid a visit to the Yu residence.

354
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,560
You know all about it?

355
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,240
Master Chai has already told me.

356
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,680
My lady has suffered such grievances.

357
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,400
I must go to the Yu family
to seek justice, or I'd fail as a husband.

358
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,280
From now on,

359
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,840
asking my lady for any favor,

360
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,920
I would be too ashamed to even speak.

361
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,400
I never asked you

362
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,280
to go to the Yu family
to accuse and reproach.

363
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
It was I who wanted to go.

364
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,560
My tolerance
is as thin as the tip of a needle.

365
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,280
I cannot stand others bullying my lady.

366
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,480
But rest assured, my lady.

367
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,480
That arrogant lady of the Yu family today
is not having a good time.

368
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,560
I've never been one to hold grudges
or create enmity with others.

369
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,000
Yes.

370
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,720
It is all my fault then.

371
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
Then, I apologize to my darling sis.

372
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,240
Didn't I tell you?

373
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,240
Don't speak carelessly.

374
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,680
Lest you become a laughingstock.

375
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,440
That Yu family
holds high office and great authority.

376
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,600
I thought in your heart

377
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,440
that official position

378
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,720
is much more important than me.

379
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,080
In my heart,

380
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,640
the official position is never
as important as my lady.

381
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,640
My lady's smile

382
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,080
is what's truly important.

383
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,640
Big sis,
you're not angry anymore, are you?

384
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,880
You must not
embroider anymore in the future.

385
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,800
YU RESIDENCE

386
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,680
My lady.

387
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,360
Really?

388
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,920
Go and shut the door quickly.

389
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,280
No one is allowed in.
Say I have a headache and I'm resting.

390
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,680
- Go quickly.
- Alright.

391
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,640
YU WEIYI

392
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,760
My lord.

393
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,280
Father.

394
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,040
Are you going to shut
your father out as well?

395
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,200
Father, it's so late.

396
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,560
You suddenly
come to your daughter's boudoir.

397
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,400
Is there something important
you want to say?

398
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,040
I previously had someone

399
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,400
bring the articles of the new Jinshi
to the boudoir.

400
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,080
Have you seen them all?

401
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,280
Yes.

402
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,120
You have loved reading
since you were young

403
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,960
and are very opinionated.

404
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,840
As your father, I don't want to go
against your wishes.

405
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,840
I'm considering
choosing a talented gentleman

406
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,520
to be well-matched with you for life.

407
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,880
These articles all come from

408
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,200
talented young scholars.

409
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,040
Is there anyone you fancy among them?

410
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,400
My talents are ordinary.

411
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,520
Though not daring to compare
with Ban Zhao and Daoyun.

412
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,040
But I have read some books.

413
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,920
In my humble opinion,

414
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,520
these articles

415
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,640
are nothing but rote memorization
for examinations.

416
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,600
There is no spirit or talent
between the lines.

417
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,240
They were sent to Father, nothing but
showing off minor skills before an expert.

418
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,960
Showing off before an expert?

419
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,920
Well said.

420
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,600
I have something to discuss
with your lady.

421
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,040
You all go out first.

422
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,000
Yes.

423
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,480
Father.

424
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,360
Father.

425
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,720
What did I do wrong?

426
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,400
You still have the face to ask.

427
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,080
I've been cautious in office all my life,
living a life of integrity.

428
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,880
Yet I never expected
to have you as a curse.

429
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,200
Pining for men in secret,
ruining our family's reputation.

430
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,840
Coercing and tempting others to cuckold.

431
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,920
Such a proper lady,

432
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,400
yet committing such absurdities.

433
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,520
At this age,

434
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,680
to be sternly questioned by a junior
because of you.

435
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,760
Reproaching me for not educating
my daughter and not controlling my house.

436
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,760
I didn't ask the servants to punish you.
It was me saving face for you.

437
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,960
To avoid my lifetime of reputation
being ruined by you.

438
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,120
- Today, I'll beat you and end it.
- Father.

439
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,120
Father. Spare me, Father.

440
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,640
- Father.
- You scoundrel.

441
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,320
- Father! Father!
- Don't you dare run.

442
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,640
- I'm sorry.
- Madam.

443
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,160
Get away! How dare you coerce and tempt
to make others cuckold?

444
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,720
You committed such a disreputable act.

445
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,400
Mother.

446
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,960
- Father's going to kill me.
- Don't hit.

447
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,400
Please don't hit.

448
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,120
My lord.

449
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,960
Do you know what she has done?

450
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,880
She is our only child.

451
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,840
MADAM YU

452
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,800
We hoped that she would marry a man
of equal talent and appearance,

453
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,560
to carry on the Yu family lineage.

454
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,800
If you, in a moment of anger tonight,
become careless

455
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,560
and actually beat our daughter to death,

456
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,080
the hopes
of half a lifetime would be in vain.

457
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,600
You'll regret it when it's too late.

458
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,400
This is thanks to your way
of raising our daughter.

459
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,920
- Get out of my way.
- Mother.

460
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,760
Can't blame your father for being angry.

461
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,560
You are normally so clever.

462
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,920
Who incited you

463
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,800
to do such foolish things?

464
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,320
Kneel.

465
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Father, I'm sorry.

466
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,760
Please forgive me.

467
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,560
My lord,

468
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,200
I will certainly discipline her
strictly in the future.

469
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,360
I will never allow her
to fool around outside

470
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,840
and tarnish the family's reputation.

471
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,480
My lord,

472
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,760
for the sake of your wife,

473
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,960
spare her this time.

474
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,040
My lord.

475
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,160
Like mother, like daughter.

476
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,920
I should have expected this.

477
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,200
Mother.

478
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,880
That Mr. Du

479
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,640
is just a poor and pedantic scholar.

480
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,000
He's nowhere worthy of the Yu family

481
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,640
or worthy of your such concern.

482
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,560
Mother.

483
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,800
Alright, get up.

484
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,840
I really regret it.

485
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,280
I should not have indulged you so.

486
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,600
Spoiled you to not understand
the ways of the world

487
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
and act recklessly.

488
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,080
The precious pearl of the Yu family

489
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,040
still afraid of not finding a good man?

490
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,040
That Mr. Du has a wife.

491
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,840
You insist on picking this unripe melon

492
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,840
and almost caused a disaster.

493
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,880
Fortunately, it has not been publicized.

494
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,080
Otherwise, of the families of Bianjing,
who'd be willing to propose again?

495
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,200
Mother and Father, though you've chosen
all the talented scholars in the world,

496
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,560
I just don't like any of them.

497
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320
I have set my heart on Du Yangxi.

498
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,280
Mother, if you truly pity me,

499
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,720
then fulfill your daughter's wishes.

500
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,640
It won't do.

501
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,480
Just give up this notion.

502
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,000
I'm telling you.
You are not allowed to see him anymore.

503
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,320
If you ever commit such an ugly act again,

504
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,360
at your father's place,
I can't protect you either.

505
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,960
Those private exchanges
in the marketplaces.

506
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,720
Once you marry as you wish,

507
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,600
even if there's a scandal
as big as the sky,

508
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,240
isn't it covered up by a brocade quilt?

509
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,760
Mother, let your daughter have her way.

510
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,640
Your daughter lost all her honor
in one day and has no interest in living.

511
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,240
Might as well

512
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,680
hang myself with a rope

513
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,360
and not trouble my parents anymore.

514
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,920
You.

515
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,080
Mother.

516
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,720
I know you care for me the most.

517
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,280
Then grant your daughter her wish.

518
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,000
Originally,
this was not a difficult matter.

519
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,560
But you've made a big fuss
and alarmed the enemy.

520
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,440
Now it has become difficult to handle.

521
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,400
Mother, why don't you
think of another solution?

522
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,840
All right then.

523
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,960
Then I will give it some good thought.

524
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,440
Think carefully.

525
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,400
XIANGGUO TEMPLE

526
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,680
Come here.

527
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,760
Here we are.

528
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,080
Take it slow.

529
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,920
Careful. Take it slow.

530
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,080
I just said so.

531
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,320
I can come to fulfill
the vow on your behalf.

532
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,360
Your eyes are not convenient.

533
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,280
What if you stumble and get hurt?

534
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,520
Thanks to the Bodhisattva's blessing,

535
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,040
my son passed the exams
and married a good wife.

536
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,040
If I don't come to burn incense
and repay the vow, how can I be at peace?

537
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,320
Yes, yes.

538
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,160
Sangma, come quickly and help hold.

539
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,920
You are always watching the fun.

540
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Madam,

541
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,600
you shouldn't lack people by your side.

542
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,560
Later,

543
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,560
I'll find you someone more clever.

544
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,480
I don't need it.

545
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,600
That Runyue before,

546
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,520
I reckon that

547
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,320
her thoughts were too frivolous.

548
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,400
Sangma is simple and honest.

549
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,920
I think it's just right.

550
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,800
Come. Take it slow.

551
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,520
Gladiolus.

552
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,240
Jasmine.
Fine flowers for offering before Buddha.

553
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,160
Madam,

554
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,480
buy some flowers to offer before Buddha.

555
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,800
Good, good.

556
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,280
I'll personally select them.

557
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,520
Sangma,

558
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,400
don't be too playful and watch carefully.

559
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,960
I'll be right back. Keep an eye on it.

560
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,000
Madam, buy a bunch of flowers.

561
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,680
Look at this bunch, just picked today.

562
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,360
- How much?
- Ten coins per bundle.

563
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,360
That expensive?

564
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,000
What about that red one?

565
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,240
Take a look at this bundle.

566
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,360
- Okay, I'll take this one then.
- Good, okay.

567
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,280
Ten coins per bundle.

568
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,200
Pay up.

569
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,400
This one's good.

570
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,920
- Gladiolus.
- Madam.

571
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,840
Jasmine.

572
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,680
Madam?

573
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,520
Quick, go look for them!

574
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,200
- I'll go there and ask around.
- Okay.

575
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,800
Gladiolus, jasmine.

576
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,880
Madam.

577
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,120
Darling.

578
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,760
What is this for?

579
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,640
Soon, the new Jinshi in the imperial
examination will be appointed to office.

580
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,840
No one knows where you will be assigned.

581
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,960
We need to pack up early.

582
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,640
My lady, do you want to
accompany me to my post?

583
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,560
But what if

584
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,240
I am dispatched to a remote place
and there's no more chance for promotion?

585
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,680
Even so,
you're still willing to accompany me?

586
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,040
You have offended your superior for me.
Aren't you afraid he will bear a grudge?

587
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,200
If you aren't afraid, neither am I.

588
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,800
Having married you, even if it means
going to the ends of the earth,

589
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,080
I will have to follow you.

590
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,360
My darling wife.

591
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,320
Yangxi, there is an accident.

592
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,720
Your mother, she's gone missing.

593
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,600
These are all fruits and vegetables
from our own garden.

594
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,440
They were just delivered this morning.

595
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,440
Madam Du, try this melon.

596
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,480
I can't speak for the others, but it's
better than those from the market,

597
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,520
having more fragrance.

598
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,560
I'm grateful for the lady's kindness.

599
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,200
I really shouldn't decline.

600
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,960
But I already ate too much this morning.

601
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,760
My virtuous daughter-in-law advised

602
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,160
against eating too many
cold foods when going out.

603
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,400
I've only heard about madam

604
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,160
restricting the daughter-in-law.

605
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,840
This is the first time seeing
a younger person lecturing an elder.

606
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,560
It's clear you've found
someone you're proud of.

607
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,600
Wondering from which family
this fine young lady comes from?

608
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,400
I'm from a humble family,

609
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,880
grateful that
the in-laws do not forsake us.

610
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,920
Even more precious is Shouhua's
virtue, speech, appearance, and merit.

611
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,120
Everything is satisfactory.

612
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,400
When managing the family,
she makes sure every aspect is meticulous.

613
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,920
Before me,

614
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,960
she is even more attentive in service,

615
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,440
filial, and virtuous.

616
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,680
When I drink a cup of tea,

617
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,800
she tests it first for temperature.

618
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,280
When I take off a piece of clothing,

619
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,800
she worries about warmth first.

620
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,440
I often talk with my son about this.

621
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,880
We're lucky we didn't seek connections
through the privileged.

622
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,680
If we had married someone
arrogant and spoiled,

623
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,160
our Du family
couldn't possibly attend to them.

624
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,160
Being of commoner origins,

625
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,080
I'm afraid she might not
be very well-versed in literature.

626
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,560
Can she converse well with Mr. Du?

627
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,320
My daughter-in-law

628
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,200
is not only beautiful and kind-hearted,

629
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,000
but also talented in poetry and painting.

630
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,360
She is a boudoir poet.

631
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,840
A woman among the scholars.

632
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,320
Matches well in conversation with my son.

633
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,840
Very compatible.

634
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,880
What's the matter?
Did I do something wrong?

635
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,960
It's nothing serious.

636
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,400
It was my own carelessness.

637
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,160
I'll come after I change my clothes.

638
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,840
Sangma, come here.

639
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,360
Sit and eat.

640
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,880
Come, eat.

641
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,280
Eat more.

642
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,000
Sorry, I ate too much ice fruit.

643
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,640
- A bit of a stomach ache.
- This way.

644
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,000
There's clean paper inside.
Bath beans and towels are on the rack.

645
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,720
Use incense when you come out.

646
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,000
If there's a scent on you,
madam will not like it.

647
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,240
Got it.

648
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,240
There's no clean paper.

649
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,440
I'll go get it.

650
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,600
Country girl is such a hassle.

651
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,280
Sangma.

652
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,360
Over there, quickly.

653
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,240
Everyone is looking down on me.

654
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,320
What's wrong with the maid's
big hands and long feet?

655
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,240
I can eat three bowls of rice
and plow the land.

656
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,360
I can still climb trees.

657
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,040
Clean paper.

658
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,720
Where are you?

659
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,680
It is getting late.

660
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,480
I better not disturb.

661
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,200
It's time to go back.

662
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,120
Madam Du,

663
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,520
there is a lotus pond in the backyard.

664
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,400
It leads the running water up to the roof.

665
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,640
Open this back window
and there's a water curtain.

666
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,480
It's very cool at night.

667
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,200
Apart from this door to go in and out,
you have no fear of outsiders disturbing.

668
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,320
Just stay here with peace of mind.

669
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,880
Wait two days and I'll send word

670
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,520
to ask Mr. Du to pick you up.

671
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,840
Madam Yu.

672
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,240
- Madam Yu.
- Please slow down.

673
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,160
- Madam Yu.
- Slow down.

674
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,840
Slow down.

675
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,840
Madam, the country girl has run away.

676
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,640
Mother.

677
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,600
I know.

678
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,240
Mother.

679
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,400
Who is here?

680
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,640
An old beggar woman.

681
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,200
Her manners are crude
and unbearable to watch.

682
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,360
You must think it through.

683
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,560
Don't regret it halfway.

684
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,200
Mother, I will not regret it.

685
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,720
But what about Father?

686
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,560
Your father…

687
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,320
His temperament

688
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,360
is like the wet kindling
and empty firecrackers.

689
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,040
He actually likes Mr. Du
for his character and literary talent.

690
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,080
If not for him being married, there was
indeed an intent for a marital alliance.

691
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,080
He just has been proud
in the officialdom for too long.

692
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,880
Because of
these trivial matters of children,

693
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,360
being contradicted
by a younger generation,

694
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,640
he just couldn't save face for a while.

695
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,760
I reasoned well with him last night.

696
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,880
Finally, he has reconsidered.

697
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,040
Really?
Father really agrees to fulfill my wishes?

698
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,160
However, you must follow his rule.

699
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,840
That is, Du Yangxi actively sent
a matchmaker to propose marriage.

700
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,680
Let bygones be bygones.

701
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,760
But…

702
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,800
Rest assured.

703
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,200
My beloved daughter was terrified
by that Mr. Du.

704
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,680
I will surely make him kneel to propose

705
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,600
to preserve your dignity.

706
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,800
Thank you, Mother.
You are really good to me.

707
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,840
Silly girl.

708
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,280
Unfortunately, Mr. Du, my master
has gone to the palace to discuss affairs.

709
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,000
He's not at home at the moment,
and I don't know when he will return.

710
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,360
I dare not delay the important affairs
of Minister Yu.

711
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,520
My mother was invited
to visit Minister Yu's residence.

712
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,800
Just now, a maid hurried back
to report a message,

713
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,320
saying that my mother had instructed

714
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,480
that I must go to pick her up at dusk.

715
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,800
I dare not disobey my mother's order.

716
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,880
That's why I took the liberty
to come and ask.

717
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,080
Could you go in and make an announcement?

718
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,640
I'll report to the madam.

719
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,720
Excuse me.

720
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,200
Thank you very much.

721
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,880
In previous days, when Mr. Du visited,

722
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,480
he was served tea in the study room.

723
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,960
Turning him away at the door,

724
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,240
I'm afraid Master would blame.

725
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,280
Why not invite him to the gatehouse?

726
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,160
The madam's instructed no one's allowed to
show him a seat or serve him tea.

727
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,280
No one should pay him any attention.
Just let him wait.

728
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:14,520
YU RESIDENCE

729
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,760
My lord,

730
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,320
this is too much.

731
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,960
It has already been an hour

732
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,400
and still no half a word in reply.

733
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,760
In the past, willing to treat me
with favor is just for the sake

734
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,760
of reputation of honoring
the virtuous and humble.

735
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,280
Now, they have turned their backs,
wanting to put on airs of an official now.

736
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,480
Don't worry.

737
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,400
Wait then.

738
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,200
My lord, someone's coming.

739
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,080
Earlier, the madam was taking a nap.

740
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,760
The servants did not dare to disturb her.

741
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,160
Sorry to keep you waiting.

742
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,360
Please forgive my offenses.

743
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,320
The madam has ordered.

744
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,120
Please wait in the study for tea.

745
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,320
Please.

746
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,120
Thank you very much.

747
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,120
My lady, do not hurry.

748
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,440
My lord said he'll be back
after picking up the mistress.

749
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,120
Are you hungry?
I will serve the meal for you.

750
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,360
I'm not hungry. You eat first.

751
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,480
You have been sitting for a long time.

752
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,760
I will give your shoulders a rub
to relax your bones.

753
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,760
No need. I cannot accept it.

754
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,960
It's okay, madam.

755
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,640
It's okay, madam.

756
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,240
No need. I cannot accept it.

757
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,760
- It's okay, madam.
- Mother.

758
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,280
Yangxi.

759
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,320
- Mother, where are you?
- Yangxi.

760
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,520
I'm here.

761
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,880
Madam.

762
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,400
Yangxi.

763
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,200
- Yangxi.
- Mother.

764
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,920
- Yangxi.
- Mother, are you alright?

765
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,200
It's alright.

766
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,520
Madam Yu is very enthusiastic
in hosting guests.

767
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,880
She insists on having me stay
in this fine and cool room.

768
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,160
And she has found someone to attend to me.

769
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,760
What a pity for my poor old bones.

770
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,760
Old and stiff.

771
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,680
I'm not accustomed
to these high beds and soft pillows.

772
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,920
Let's go back quickly.

773
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,800
Don't leave Shouhua waiting in vain.

774
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,520
Yes.

775
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,000
- Come, Mother.
- Yuanming.

776
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,320
Yuanming.

777
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,080
It's alright, Mother.

778
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,640
Minister Yu.

779
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,360
No need for excessive courtesy.

780
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,440
My wife reads your essays
and is full of praise of you.

781
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,560
She's heard of the hardships
endured by your mother,

782
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,760
raising a child successfully.

783
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,600
She greatly admires this
and specially invited her to meet.

784
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,760
Blaming her for not thinking thoroughly.

785
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,600
She did not send someone
to pass a message.

786
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,120
I'm afraid it startled your mother.

787
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,240
My mistake.

788
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,800
Mother,

789
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,200
this is Minister Yu.

790
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,240
I've often been favored
and supported by the minister.

791
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,680
Boundless kindness
like the heavens and the earth.

792
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,880
I often think of a way to repay him.

793
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,360
Mother, please meet the minister.

794
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,480
I want to go home.

795
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,040
Did you hear that?

796
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,480
I want to go home.

797
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,200
Alright, Mother.

798
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,600
We'll go back right now.

799
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,160
Minister Yu, my mother has lived
in the countryside for a long time.

800
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,360
She seldom sees strangers.

801
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,240
Please forgive her.

802
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,160
No harm.

803
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,600
Then go ahead.

804
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,560
After going home,

805
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,120
take good care of your mother.

806
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,720
Thank you, Minister,
for your immense tolerance.

807
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,880
We'll take our leave first.

808
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,880
Good.

809
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,040
Come, Mother.

810
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,360
Let's go back home.

811
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,320
- Slow down.
- Go home.

812
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,640
- Hurry home.
- Slow down, Mother.

813
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,160
Sorry to trouble you, my lady.

814
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,320
I'll keep watch here tonight.
You go back and rest.

815
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,240
Let me do it.

816
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,680
Go on.

817
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,920
Yangxi.

818
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,160
Yangxi.

819
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,480
Yangxi.

820
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,240
- Yangxi.
- Yangxi is here.

821
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,400
Yangxi is here, Mother.

822
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,760
Yangxi.

823
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,680
Yangxi.

824
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,400
<i>Mother,</i>

825
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,320
this is Minister Yu.

826
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,880
I've often been favored
and supported by the minister.

827
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,160
I want to go home.

828
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,720
I want to go home.

829
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,840
Alright, Mother.

830
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,080
FANG

831
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,440
My lady.

832
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,120
My lady.

833
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,400
The black sesame powder was sent.
Madam Li bought some meat.

834
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,080
It's been marinated and smells delicious.

835
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,760
She had Ms. Liu fill a big bowl for me.

836
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,680
Look.

837
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,080
She said this black sesame powder

838
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,400
must be ground even finer.

839
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,680
Wait until the porridge boils
before sprinkling.

840
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,920
Right.

841
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,400
She also gave me a bag of dates.

842
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,560
Big and sweet ones.

843
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,160
Put them in while cooking porridge.

844
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,320
Madam Du will feel calm
and at ease after eating it.

845
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,240
I know.

846
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,400
Little glutton.

847
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,000
Come with me quickly.

848
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,920
- I have important matters to discuss.
- Since when has my lord been there?

849
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,880
There are rumors
in the Ministry of Personnel

850
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,640
the top three scholars become
Assistant Officers of Construction Bureau

851
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,600
in multiple administrative regions,
which are rich and prosperous.

852
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,840
Yet you're going to Xiongzhou.
This isn't right.

853
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,360
Xiongzhou is a border area
between the Song and Liao dynasties.

854
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,880
Its geographic position is important.

855
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,560
The court intends on giving me experience.
What's wrong with that?

856
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,840
Of course, it's not right.

857
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,840
Because it's on the border, there are
turbulent undercurrents beneath the calm.

858
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,800
Only an official
with experience could handle it.

859
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,560
You're starting out,
and have no foundation in the court.

860
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,520
You might cause trouble
before achieving merit.

861
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,560
Personal honor and disgrace
are trivial matters.

862
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,360
How can state matters be unimportant?

863
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,440
I really do not understand.

864
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,600
Unless someone is deliberately
making things difficult,

865
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,040
why would the court
send you to guard the frontier?

866
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,840
This has been said since ancient times,

867
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,320
one should not seek ease in aspirations,
nor avoid difficulty in tasks.

868
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,560
Without encountering intricate problems,
how can one distinguish the sharp weapon?

869
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,400
So, don't worry about me.

870
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,040
I forgot to congratulate you.

871
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,040
You've been appointed
as an Archivist in Secretariat Department

872
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,600
in charge of Chenliu County.

873
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,840
So close to Bianjing,

874
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,640
you must visit my mother more often now.
Don't let her worry about you.

875
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,440
So, you already knew.

876
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,560
Then how can you still be
as steady as Mount Tai?

877
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,280
Du Yangxi.

878
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,600
- Du Yangxi.
- I can hear you.

879
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,080
What can I do about it?

880
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,760
Whatever the court assigns me to do,
I can't do anything about it either way.

881
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,600
I can only stay calm and deal with it.

882
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,720
But if you go to Xiongzhou,

883
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,920
what about Shouhua?

884
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,880
Can she endure
the harsh and cold conditions?

885
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,560
You're practically asking for her life.

886
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,160
Why do I feel that you care about Shouhua
even more than I do?

887
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,760
