00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,200
EPISODE 20

2
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,560
Cousin, what did you say? Say it again.

3
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,760
Ah Cai was once a maid in the Li family.

4
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,400
When Mr. Li fell ill,
he sent his servants away.

5
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,440
She then left the house

6
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,320
and married a butcher.

7
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,840
They had a son, Youlong, now 16.

8
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,760
Sixteen?

9
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,000
He's a posthumous child?

10
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,320
Mother-in-law is so tough.
Father-in-law still had affairs?

11
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,280
Stop talking nonsense.

12
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,880
She said there's no such thing.

13
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,400
Who can say for sure?

14
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,520
Now, a lively young man shows up.

15
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,680
He can even accuse them.

16
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,080
It's gone to court now.

17
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,880
Chai.

18
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,360
Yuanming, how's it going?

19
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,360
Lord Shen accepted the case?

20
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,640
Not only that,

21
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,840
their relatives also reported it

22
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,920
to the Kaifeng Court.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,280
What?

24
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,320
The Li family now has two cases
against them.

25
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,440
What did Shen Huizhao say?

26
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,000
I asked his teacher, Minister Liu,
for a letter

27
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,080
and delivered my request
to his house in person,

28
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,360
but he refused to meet.

29
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,360
Not even a polite excuse.

30
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,760
Never seen someone so stubborn.

31
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,200
No wonder people call him Iron Heart.

32
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,360
He's totally heartless.

33
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,840
- Oh no.
- What's wrong?

34
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,880
They're after Li's property.

35
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,440
If they want to go to the court,

36
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,280
Li's daughters will appear in court.

37
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,200
Why didn't I think of this? This is bad.

38
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,080
Mom, drink the medicine first.

39
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,000
- Just a sip.
- Mom.

40
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,040
I don't want to.

41
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,040
What are you looking for?

42
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,720
I'm checking if Dad left behind any notes

43
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,480
to verify the identity of them.

44
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,160
You heartless child.

45
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,400
You're my daughter.

46
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,560
You still believe those two liars?

47
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,680
If you speak something like that again,

48
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,720
your father's spirit won't forgive you.

49
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,440
Mom.

50
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,360
Say sorry to Mom.

51
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,320
Okay?

52
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,720
Mom, ask Shouhua,

53
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,760
Kangning,

54
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,320
who doesn't think like this?

55
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,520
You can scold or beat me.

56
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,920
Others will just try to appease you.

57
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,040
In this family, besides me,

58
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,160
who dares speak the truth?

59
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,160
Haode.

60
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,600
What are you doing here?
What about Jiaojiao?

61
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,400
She's with her grandma.

62
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,840
Mom, this is serious.

63
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,640
When did Dad have another son?

64
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,720
You think so too?

65
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,160
You all think so too?

66
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,560
All of you?

67
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,960
Mom,

68
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,080
we trust Dad,

69
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,400
but we need to clarify things.

70
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,400
We can't blindly go into this lawsuit.

71
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,120
Right?

72
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,520
He was under my nose this whole time.

73
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,440
When did they stir up such trouble?

74
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,400
How could they hide it from me?

75
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,800
Now, you all come asking me questions?

76
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,080
The coffin's already rotting.

77
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,760
How can I dig up the truth now?

78
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,160
Posthumous child?

79
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,400
They only appeared after 16 years.

80
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,760
They are taking advantage that Dad's gone,
so they can tell lies as they wish.

81
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,440
But Dad's gone now.

82
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,320
We can't prove he's not his father.

83
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,960
Mom.

84
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,000
Those people are thieves,
robbing our land and property.

85
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,240
The little that's left,

86
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,280
we risked our lives to protect.

87
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,680
I'm a Li family daughter.

88
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,080
I'll go to court with you.

89
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,400
No one outside will take what's ours.

90
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,640
If we have to face the punishment,

91
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,040
I'll take it for Mom.

92
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,160
Haode.

93
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,640
Leshan, go.

94
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,880
Bring your brothers-in-law back.

95
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,480
It's rare for Haode to have such courage.

96
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,680
We will surely go.

97
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,720
But what will we say in court?

98
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,480
We need to discuss that.

99
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,520
We're going to court.

100
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,360
The law of the Song Dynasty is there.

101
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,120
They can't just make things up
and get away with it.

102
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,600
Alright, we'll do it your way.

103
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,080
- Go, Leshan.
- Okay.

104
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,840
KAIFENG COURT

105
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:29,520
Order.

106
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,240
Li family brothers,

107
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,360
why are you suing your Aunt Li?

108
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,440
My lord,

109
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,320
since Uncle passed
and Cousin Shifan tragically died,

110
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,920
the clan head decided we need a successor

111
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,000
to inherit his legacy.

112
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,600
But Aunt refused to adopt one.

113
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,160
This wicked woman

114
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,240
is trying to cut off
my uncle's descendant.

115
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,880
Ridiculous.

116
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,880
If a man dies,
the wife has the right to judge.

117
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,040
Since Mr. Li and his son are gone

118
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,920
and Madam Li hasn't remarried,

119
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,240
his inheritance should go
to his daughters.

120
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,320
Who dares take it from them?

121
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,240
Did you hear that?

122
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,360
It's for the daughters.

123
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,160
Two of my five daughters aren't married.

124
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,440
We wouldn't dare, my lord. You're right.

125
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,400
But my uncle left a will

126
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,520
to let Aunt support us

127
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,880
80 strings per year
and 200 catty of grain.

128
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,200
But over the past ten years,
Aunt's never mentioned anything about it.

129
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,280
We've had no choice but to sue.

130
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,720
My lord, we have the document,

131
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,560
signed by the clan head and all relatives.

132
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,120
My lord, Aunt even sold land

133
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,040
and moved the family
just to avoid the promise.

134
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,800
We ask you to rule on this.

135
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,160
Please, my lord.

136
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,440
You still dare to ask for debts from me?

137
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,360
- My lord.
- The wheat you stole from my land.

138
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,960
How much did you sell it for?
How much did you sell from my land?

139
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,920
Tell me.

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,840
- What're you doing?
- What'd you get for the silverware

141
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,640
- at your uncles mourning hall?
- Help, my lord.

142
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,640
- How much did you get from his funeral?
- My lord.

143
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,040
- Why don't you say that?
- My lord.

144
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,760
- Not enough for your coffin?
- Mom!

145
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,160
- Order!
- Ah!

146
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,360
My lord, you saw it all.

147
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,920
She's hitting me in court.

148
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,240
We're family.

149
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,440
We didn't want to go to court,

150
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,520
but Aunt treats us like enemies.

151
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,480
We're here today
because we have no choice.

152
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,800
We ask you to give us justice.

153
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,440
We ask you to give us justice.

154
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,760
Worse than pigs and dogs.

155
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,440
Shouting in court.

156
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,280
Slap 20 times. Guards!

157
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,520
My lord, my cousin's causing a scene,

158
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
making false accusations.

159
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,600
My mother was overwhelmed by anger.

160
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,600
Please show mercy

161
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,360
and spare her because of her weak body.

162
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,240
If she does this again,

163
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,800
I'll take her place.

164
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,920
In court,

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,440
if anyone dares act up again,

166
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,960
add 20 more lashes.

167
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,800
- Li Shiqian.
- My lord.

168
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,680
You said

169
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,000
you want to bring the outside child
into the family.

170
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,760
Now, I'm combining both cases
into one case.

171
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,760
Any objections from either side?

172
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,600
Let the court decide.

173
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,720
Take the plaintiff, Ah Cai and Li Youlong.

174
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,640
- My lord.
- My lord.

175
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,120
I have a warning about a posthumous child.

176
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,320
There's no proof left
because his dad's gone.

177
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
I won't accept the case.

178
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,320
If you can't provide any proof

179
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,240
to demonstrate your lineage,

180
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,200
I'll treat it as a fraud case.

181
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,560
You'll be punished in the end.

182
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,880
My lord, I would never.

183
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,760
About the origin of Ah Cai's son.

184
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,560
Before my uncle passed, he often sighed.

185
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,120
He feared my aunt's jealousy
would harm his son.

186
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,320
He never revealed the truth.

187
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,320
Before he died, he couldn't
bring Youlong back to the family.

188
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,920
This became his lifelong regret.

189
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,040
They live in hardship now,
struggling to survive.

190
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,240
As his cousin,

191
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,200
I must seek justice for him

192
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,320
and help my poor kin

193
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
to finish my uncle's last wish

194
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,520
and let him rest in peace.

195
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,720
You--

196
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,760
Mom.

197
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,000
My lord, my mother's fuming,

198
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,440
so she's kind of acted out.

199
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,200
Please let me respond for her.

200
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,320
Okay.

201
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,160
Shouhua.

202
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,360
You just need to know the marriage law.

203
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,320
I've pointed out the section.

204
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,320
Maybe let bother-in-law
accompany Mom in court.

205
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,680
The judge might consider his reputation.

206
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,080
And Kangning, you have a silver tongue.

207
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,080
Your words are more convincing.

208
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,920
Your big sisters are all married,

209
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,880
and we can't even get involved.

210
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,760
Many things should be said by you,
the unmarried daughter.

211
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,960
Haode, these sections are fixed.

212
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,200
You should argue
based on the rules in court.

213
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,440
We're counting on you.

214
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,320
Remember,
you're not just fighting for Mom.

215
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,640
You're fighting for yourself and Leshan.

216
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,400
Li Haode.

217
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,040
Li Haode, do you have a defense?

218
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,640
My lord.

219
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,680
They've been after our estate for years,

220
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,240
and they have even sued us over and over.

221
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,440
They're sworn enemies.

222
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,480
You can't trust them.

223
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,080
This is a sacred court.

224
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,640
A girl shouldn't be speaking here.
Leave now.

225
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,000
Leave.

226
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,560
I'm the unmarried daughter of the Li.

227
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,080
The estate should belong to us.

228
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,880
They are accusing their aunt unfairly.

229
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,320
They've disrespected elders
and now questioning me?

230
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,640
This doesn't make any sense.

231
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,640
You…

232
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,400
She's right.

233
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,840
Ah Cai, any other proof?

234
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,440
My lord,

235
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,800
in the fifth month of the fifth year
of Dazhong Xiangfu,

236
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,600
I left pregnant.

237
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,640
Mr. Li passed in the sixth month.

238
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,200
Youlong was born on the 15th
of the second month in the next year.

239
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,000
Granny Liu from Bozi Street

240
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,360
and Li Auntie can testify.

241
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,560
Before coming to Bianjing,

242
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,520
they stamped this paper.

243
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,440
The midwife only knew he was premature.

244
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,280
How could she know if he's Li or Wu?

245
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,960
You're all conspiring together
to blackmail us.

246
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,960
- Mom.
- The Li couple only had one son.

247
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,240
The Li family is not so rich

248
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,760
but still values education.

249
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,920
How could he let his kid follow a butcher?

250
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,560
His wife, though jealous,

251
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,640
seeing the family fall apart,

252
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,440
she'd rather bear the pressure
from the family

253
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,920
than take in the orphan
to keep life moving forward.

254
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
This doesn't make sense.

255
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,240
My lord.

256
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,640
Don't listen to her.

257
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,280
She didn't even honor my uncle's will.

258
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,560
She's not like other virtuous women.

259
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,000
My lord,

260
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,360
before my father passed,
he gave his cousin some property.

261
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,800
It was out of necessity.

262
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,400
Haven't you heard of the three-way split?

263
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,520
The wise minister Zhang Guaiya.

264
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,400
He once judged a case of inheritance.

265
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,480
When someone passed,
the son-in-law got seven.

266
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,680
The son only got three.

267
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,440
When the son grew up, they fought over it.

268
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,480
Zhang knew the father's intention.

269
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,800
The son was three when his father died.

270
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,480
His father feared the son would be harmed.

271
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,440
So, he left a will out of desperation.

272
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,640
In the end, Zhang changed the judgment.

273
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,120
The son got seven, the son-in-law three.

274
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,360
Son was young, son-in-law strong.

275
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,760
So, the son-in-law got seven.

276
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,720
My father was poor, but his cousin rich.

277
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,120
My father couldn't be at ease.

278
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,560
Before he died,

279
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,720
he begged the cousins,

280
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,960
asking his cousins to treat us kindly.

281
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,800
Don't you remember?

282
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,240
My family's stolen grain
weighed over a thousand.

283
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,400
You greedy thieves still dare to steal?

284
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,240
As for Wu Youlong,
he is definitely not my father's son.

285
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,080
<i>My father was kind to the poor,</i>
<i>loved talent.</i>

286
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,280
Liu Wang is the son of the tenant.

287
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,640
He came to our house seeking
financial help for his studies.

288
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,320
My father helped him with his education.

289
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,640
Before his death,
he left a will for his nephews.

290
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,640
He even gave half his old books to Liu.

291
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,400
But he didn't leave anything
to his own son?

292
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,240
This is truly weird.

293
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,520
After Ah Cai gave birth,

294
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,960
she did not return her son to the family.

295
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,880
My father and my brother passed away.

296
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,640
They never came to mourn.

297
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,440
The county clerk's register shows,

298
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,400
in the third month this year,
butcher Wu Yong died.

299
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,800
They changed their surname from Wu to Li.

300
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,840
Their intentions are clear to everyone.

301
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,440
A letter from a Luoyang,

302
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,280
they only changed their surname in March.

303
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,920
We were staying under someone else's roof.

304
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,000
How could he change his name
before the stepfather died?

305
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,200
Young lady, this doesn't make sense.

306
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,240
- Nonsense.
- Don't you dare!

307
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,640
Okay.

308
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
It's the ironclad proof.

309
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,080
In our family,
fathers have a bent little finger.

310
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,160
It can't straighten,
and it passed down to sons.

311
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,200
- What?
- I don't know.

312
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,760
Really?

313
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,400
You know that?

314
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,040
Never heard of it.

315
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,120
Before that…

316
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,800
My lord, though Wu Yong had a vile trade,

317
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,160
he did give life to him.

318
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,720
Wu Youlong, as a son,

319
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,560
in order to steal inheritance,
he changed his surname from Wu to Li.

320
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,280
Such greed and ungratefulness

321
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,440
mustn't have tricked you, my lord.

322
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,320
Justice always prevails.

323
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,200
They're lying, my lord. It's all a lie.

324
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,000
Li Haode's words are clear and logical.

325
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,160
If you still don't confess,
I'll have to apply torture.

326
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,960
Pressing sticks.

327
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,800
My lord.

328
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,880
It was him. He came to us.

329
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,480
He urged us to change the surname.

330
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,440
I was just confused.

331
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,720
Please show mercy, my lord.

332
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,280
- Please show mercy.
- Please show mercy.

333
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,960
- My lord, they're the greedy ones.
- My lord.

334
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,240
We didn't know anything.

335
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,520
My lord, we acted in good faith.

336
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,280
We were just witnesses. Forgive us.

337
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,800
- My lord, we were deceived.
- My lord.

338
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,320
- Please, my lord.
- My lord.

339
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,280
Show mercy to us.

340
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,720
- My lord. We didn't know.
- My lord.

341
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,440
Enough!

342
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,280
Ah Cai and Wu Youlong conspired

343
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,600
with Li family's four nephews
to lie about their lineage.

344
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,440
Since this is their first offense,
they will be beaten 80 times

345
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,600
as punishment.

346
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,000
Li Shida, Li Shiqian,

347
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,320
Li Shide, Li Shiye.

348
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,640
You forgot the kindness of your uncle

349
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,400
and plotted for inheritance.

350
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,360
Bullying the orphaned,
destroying family morals.

351
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,280
Years of disputes, no repentance.

352
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,080
Each will get 100 lashes

353
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,680
and within a month

354
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,480
return the Li family's silver,

355
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,000
boxes, and grain.

356
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,720
From now on, you should never bother them.

357
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,280
If you sue again,
you will be exiled and severely punished.

358
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,240
Adjourned.

359
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,600
That must really hurt.

360
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,320
Haode, how did I not know?

361
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,880
Your father and brother's finger thing.

362
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,480
Mom, how could there be
a disease like that?

363
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,040
I saw he was not confessing,
so, I just tricked him.

364
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,560
That's clever.

365
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,240
I learned it from you, Mom.

366
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,800
Let's go.

367
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,280
This one's nice.

368
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,080
This looks like something Shouhua wears.

369
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,760
Why take it?

370
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,120
I said her pin looks nice.

371
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,040
She said she'd give me a better one

372
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,600
if I win the case.

373
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,200
Don't break it. Give it back.

374
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,840
I like it too.

375
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,720
Can I borrow it?

376
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,800
No way. I'll need it for my wedding.

377
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
You…

378
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,640
Haode,

379
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,640
you haven't even seen a matchmaker yet

380
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,080
and you're daydreaming. How shameless.

381
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,560
Let me try.

382
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,920
What are you saying? Give it back to me.

383
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,320
- Shouhua gave it to me.
- Give it.

384
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,720
- I--
- That's from--

385
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,840
Let me check it.

386
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,520
Why are you like this?

387
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,280
You take whatever looks good.

388
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,960
You've ruined my gift.

389
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,120
Why are you two arguing?

390
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,880
You even fell down.

391
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,120
What's so special?

392
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,760
Just have her buy it for you.

393
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,760
All you do is argue.

394
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,320
It's giving me a headache.

395
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,800
You have five daughters,

396
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,160
but only I was picked by the river.

397
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,480
What nonsense are you talking?

398
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,200
Why is it that among your five fingers,

399
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm always the shortest one?

400
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,400
You always favor her.

401
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,440
You're so biased.

402
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,600
- Where are you going?
- Haode.

403
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,560
Are you really angry?

404
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,280
Cut me some slack, okay?

405
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,480
Hurry, go after her.

406
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,400
I--

407
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,640
Mom, trust me.

408
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,840
She will be back soon.

409
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,080
Tonight, we'll have lamb.

410
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,920
Lamb is her favorite.

411
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,040
Trust me, she'll be back.

412
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,760
Alright.

413
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,160
You're not allowed to eat,
you little foodie.

414
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,360
Come here.

415
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,880
Shouhua.

416
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,040
My lady,

417
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,280
I thought I'd never see you again.

418
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,160
Mom insisted on going home,

419
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,760
so I sent her back.

420
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,720
On the way back, I met her.

421
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,480
The Yu family sold servant girls.

422
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,920
A passing merchant bought her.

423
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,880
They'd already signed a deal.

424
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,960
I still managed to buy her back.

425
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,200
Shouhua, didn't you always care about her?

426
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,080
Sangma, take her to settle.

427
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,040
Sure.

428
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,520
Shouhua.

429
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,200
I worked hard to buy her back.

430
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,440
How should I be rewarded?

431
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,040
Aren't you busy moving to the new house?

432
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,560
You even have time
for small matters like this?

433
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,480
You can't bear to leave your mom,

434
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,600
living in this house,

435
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,320
so I decided not to move.

436
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,320
We're married here.

437
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,080
We'll live here, have children,
and grow old here together.

438
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,680
Here's the deed to the land. Keep it.

439
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,520
LAND DEED

440
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,760
Shouhua.

441
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,520
Shouhua, Leshan bullied me.

442
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,720
She bullied me.

443
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,120
You're fighting with her again?

444
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,640
Come, come. Sit down.

445
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,640
Come here.

446
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,360
What happened? Tell me.

447
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,200
Shouhua,

448
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,440
she always mocks me for being dumb.

449
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,440
She says

450
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,080
I'll die alone at home.

451
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,640
How could that be?

452
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,400
You're so honest and cute.

453
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,600
In the future, I'll ask Du
to find someone good

454
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,240
among his colleagues for you, alright?

455
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,680
Sure.

456
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,960
I will help you find someone.

457
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,640
Families with strict rules

458
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,640
aren't as good as finding a rich,

459
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,600
talented, and handsome man.

460
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,480
I already have someone in mind.

461
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,960
I hope you can help me

462
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,280
to get to know him.

463
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,080
Haode, marriage is serious, no jokes.

464
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,720
We're family. Let her say.

465
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,840
You have someone in mind.

466
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,160
I must help you.

467
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,000
So, who is he?

468
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,200
It's the man who saved our family,

469
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,200
the Kaifeng Court official,

470
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,520
Mr. Shen. Shen Huizhao.

471
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,360
I liked him the moment I saw him.

472
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,000
SHEN MANSION

473
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,600
Father,

474
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,120
how's Granny's condition today?

475
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,040
Has Dr. Lin arrived?

476
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,160
You little brat…

477
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,520
SHEN RONG, FATHER OF SHEN HUIZHAO

478
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,760
…how dare you show up?

479
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,120
Grandma's illness is because of you.

480
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,960
A man at your age from a family like ours

481
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,080
should already have a wife and kids,

482
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,800
but you've wasted your time.

483
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,880
You're the only one in Bianjing like this.

484
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,640
Over the years,

485
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,160
Grandma's tried to find a suitable match.

486
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,920
All noble girls, talented and beautiful.

487
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,240
Each is a good match.

488
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,640
But you rejected them all.

489
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,640
Other families now
are afraid of tying up with us.

490
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,600
I heard that you even rejected Li Shiba.

491
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,680
That's why Grandma got sick.

492
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
If you

493
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,120
have any conscience,

494
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,200
marry someone soon.

495
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,280
We don't care about status.

496
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,040
Just marry someone decent.

497
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,680
Take her to Grandma and offer respect.

498
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,320
She'll be better by tomorrow.

499
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,000
We won't need Dr. Lin.

500
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,320
Father, I've said it a thousand times.

501
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,360
I won't marry.

502
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,960
After all these years, I'm still firm.

503
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,320
Please understand.

504
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,200
I'll go meet His Majesty
and request the palace doctors.

505
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,480
I'll take my leave.

506
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,440
Not marrying, not marrying.

507
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,960
Are all women tigers?

508
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,160
Will they eat you?

509
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,920
- Did he leave?
- Yeah.

510
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,040
Did he agree?

511
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,480
It's all your fault.

512
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,800
When he was little,
you sent him to the temple.

513
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,280
What place is that?

514
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,240
Everyone always meditates
and tries to understand Zen.

515
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,520
That's where he became so detached.

516
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,840
It's too late.

517
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,080
Mom.

518
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,960
How is this my fault?

519
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,720
Didn't you say

520
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,520
that since his two elder brothers
didn't live

521
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,000
and he was weak then,

522
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,320
he should go to the temple
to live peacefully?

523
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,080
You said it was for his sickness
but not detachment.

524
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,640
Who knew it'd turn out this way?

525
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,600
It's also his job in law enforcement.

526
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,880
Money and women have always caused harm.

527
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,680
Women he saw were never kind.

528
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,320
Over time, he treated women like a threat.

529
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,280
What should we do?

530
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,440
Don't worry.

531
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,280
Madam. Master.

532
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,960
Everyone's here to check on you.

533
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,760
Also, there's a matchmaker visiting.

534
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,480
Look at him, acting all pure and innocent.

535
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,400
Like being with a woman
will shorten his life.

536
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,120
Isn't he going to cancel the marriage?

537
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,800
I'll marry for him.

538
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,120
When the bride enters,

539
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,880
let's see how he backs out.

540
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
You mean?

541
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,160
Proceed without telling him.

542
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,440
He stays at the government office often.

543
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,560
Let's say we're celebrating my birthday.

544
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,600
Let's renovate the hall garden.

545
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,640
We'll secretly plan the wedding.

546
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,160
But who'd do such thing?

547
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,520
If it's a family of equal status,
who would compromise?

548
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,320
I fear we'll end up at odds
because of his stubbornness.

549
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,560
- Not a good idea.
- Wait.

550
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,920
Did a matchmaker come?

551
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,800
Which family?

552
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,400
Nonsense.

553
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,360
Marriage is for the parents to decide.

554
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,440
Ask the matchmaker, check the birthdates.

555
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,240
There's no room for self-decision.

556
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,480
If I speak the truth,
will you agree to it?

557
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,360
How embarrassing.

558
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,920
The Shen family
is not someone we can afford.

559
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,920
It's fine if you're just
daydreaming about it yourself,

560
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,360
but if we really
let a matchmaker go to their house,

561
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,120
you'll make us the laughingstock.

562
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,280
Mom.

563
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,200
The matchmaker
will come with an answer today.

564
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,200
If it works out, it's a good thing.

565
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,800
If not, she can move on.

566
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,800
Where's the luck like this?

567
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,920
I've seen ice chunks
in the last month of the year

568
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
but never heaven dropping gold.

569
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,440
Mom.

570
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm your own daughter.

571
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,040
Yes, you are my daughter.

572
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,080
That's why I told you to give up
and stay grounded.

573
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,840
It's for your own good, alright?

574
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,840
Mom, the matchmaker is here.

575
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,480
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

576
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,160
Madam Li, big news.

577
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,000
It's done. It's done.

578
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,160
What's done?

579
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,600
Is it the marriage?

580
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,280
Yes,

581
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,920
it's the marriage
between the Li and Shen families.

582
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,360
About this marriage.

583
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,240
Even though we're supported by Mr. Du,

584
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,560
we didn't dare speak soon.

585
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,640
We'd test the waters first.

586
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,240
But when he heard
it was the Li family of Pan Street,

587
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,840
Mr. Du's sister-in-law,

588
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,000
they praised it as a lucky match.

589
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,440
They even brought a preliminary letter
and matched her birthdate.

590
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,440
They agreed right away.

591
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,000
No dowry was asked.

592
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,960
Just that Lady Shen is getting worse.

593
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,160
So, they want good luck.

594
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,640
The ceremony will be simple.

595
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,240
The wedding must happen quickly.

596
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:22,920
Th-the Shen family, the one from Kaifeng?

597
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,800
See,

598
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,760
I brought the matchmaker's letter.

599
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,920
How could it be fake?

600
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,680
Mom, it really is true.

601
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,080
Heaven really does drop gold.

602
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,720
SECOND DAY OF THE SECOND MONTH

603
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,200
SHEN MANSION

604
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,320
Ridiculous.

605
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,280
I was away for work just two days.

606
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,880
You snuck the bridal sedan into our house?

607
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,520
Treating marriage like child's play,

608
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,800
breaking family rules and morals aside,

609
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,880
you've ruined an innocent girl's life.

610
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,840
Enough.

611
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,120
How dare you speak against your elders?

612
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,760
No heir means ending our family line.

613
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,840
An un-filial act.

614
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,440
Don't you know your duty as a child?

615
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,040
Ignoring father's mistakes,

616
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,680
blindly indulging you and causing harm.

617
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,880
That is un-filial.

618
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,360
Shut up.

619
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,800
Enough.

620
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,840
I made the decision for this marriage.

621
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,480
You…

622
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,760
Whether you go along

623
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,400
or resist,

624
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,080
the bride entered through our front door.

625
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,080
She's in your room now,

626
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,960
which makes her your wife.

627
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,200
She's the daughter-in-law
of our Shen family.

628
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,680
The Li girl is young

629
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,200
and full of joy as she married in.

630
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,880
Yet you don't want her

631
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,480
and ruin her life out of spite.

632
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,680
That's your own bad karma.

633
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,440
Even your illness was a lie.

634
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,040
Everyone else knew but me.

635
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,760
Who lied to you?

636
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,960
Your grandmother's illness is real.

637
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,120
If you listen to her,

638
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,880
she'll recover and live long.

639
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,600
That's how you show your devotion.

640
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,280
Fine.

641
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,840
Well done.

642
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,880
Such a bold decision.

643
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,920
Really well done!

644
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,200
Come back!

645
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,680
Mom.

646
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,240
Wasn't this too much for him?

647
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,800
You claimed illness to avoid strangers,

648
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,920
skipped the banquet,

649
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,120
and hid it from the Li family.

650
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,560
If this gets out…

651
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,960
Quick, go check on him.

652
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,480
Don't let him
cause any trouble in the wedding room.

653
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,600
Yes.

654
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,000
We canceled the banquet
due to madam's illness.

655
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,720
Missing the ceremony's time

656
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,920
would offend the Li family.

657
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,840
Hurry things along.

658
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,640
Get out.

659
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,280
You haven't drunk the wedding wine.

660
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,600
That's against tradition.

661
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,320
Please drink with your bride.

662
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,280
Get out!

663
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,760
Let's go.

664
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,440
Li Haode.

665
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,080
I need to tell you.

666
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,280
What is it, husband?

667
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,600
I'm not your husband.

668
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,840
Though the sedan came here,

669
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,720
there was no proper ceremony.

670
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,040
No couple tradition, no rituals,

671
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,560
and no temple visit.

672
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,680
We're not truly married.

673
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,440
- So, you don't want to marry me?
- Correct.

674
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,480
This wasn't my wish.

675
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,760
My elders were trying to go against me

676
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,880
and have dragged you in.

677
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,400
I should've discussed it with you.

678
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
But since you're young and naive,

679
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,160
I'll decide for you.

680
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,320
The sedan is at the door.

681
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,760
I'll send you back.

682
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,280
In three days,

683
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,080
my father and I will apologize in person.

684
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,200
He'll compensate you generously.

685
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,120
Don't agree to less.

686
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,240
The Shen family
owns 200 acres near the capital.

687
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,440
They yield 600 bushels of grain yearly.

688
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,120
There are two estates in Luoyang

689
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,640
worth 3,000 strings of cash.

690
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,040
Demand those two.

691
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,360
If he refuses, threaten to sue for fraud.

692
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,960
He tricked you first.

693
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,280
So, he must say yes
for the sake of family's reputation.

694
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,760
Li Haode.

695
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,120
Rushed marriages don't end well.

696
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,440
When you marry again, look carefully.

697
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,680
Don't let the matchmaker deceive you.

698
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,480
When you find someone at your age
and suitable for you,

699
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,160
I'll explain everything myself.

700
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,320
I won't let you miss another good match.

701
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,480
Was she safely returned to her home?

702
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,320
- Master, something's happened.
- What?

703
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,200
I was ready to send her back
as your ordered,

704
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,560
but when the sedan arrived, she was gone.

705
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,120
Who's that knocking like this?

706
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,640
Did Chunlai oversleep again?

707
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,160
Sleeping so soundly.

708
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,560
- Coming, coming.
- Mom.

709
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I'll open the door.

710
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,280
Coming.

711
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,920
- Who is it?
- Who's there?

712
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,640
- Haode?
- Qiongnu.

713
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,560
Haode?

714
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,320
Mom.

715
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,000
Mom.

716
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,920
Mom.

717
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,520
What's going on?

718
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,680
Why are you alone?

719
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,040
Why are you shaking?

720
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,240
Alright, alright.

721
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,400
Put this on.

722
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,400
Let's talk inside.

723
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,440
Come on. Inside.

724
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,640
Haode.

725
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,680
Let's go.

726
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,720
Be careful.

727
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,000
I won't ride in their sedan.

728
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,200
I ran off while they weren't looking.

729
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,800
Look. Look at this.

730
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,040
When it was arranged,

731
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,720
I suspected something was off,

732
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,760
but no one listened.

733
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,480
You think it's perfect,

734
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,920
letting the Shen family rush the wedding.

735
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,720
They quickly married Haode off.

736
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,480
They assumed our family wouldn't protest

737
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,920
even if we knew the truth.

738
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,120
This is too much.

739
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,720
The Shen family seems well-respected.

740
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,440
Shen Huizhao's reputation is good.

741
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,760
He even helped us last time.

742
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,360
I thought he chose Haode
because of that day in court.

743
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,440
I was careless.

744
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,240
What did Mom say?

745
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,800
Last night, after knowing the truth,

746
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,520
she wanted to confront them,

747
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,760
but I stopped her.

748
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,080
She was too angry,

749
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,160
complaining about a headache.

750
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,800
Qiongnu's with her inside.

751
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,280
Mr. Shen might have some hidden illness?

752
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,720
A man of his age should be married.

753
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,880
They're all from prestigious families.

754
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,400
Even if the engagement was broken,
they'd keep it quiet.

755
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,400
They hid it well.

756
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,200
We can't keep looking into this.

757
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,400
Haode…

758
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,880
Don't worry about him.

759
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,120
It's their fault.

760
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,120
He shouldn't be let off so easily.

761
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,840
When he comes, strip him of everything.

762
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,640
Take the land and property they offer.

763
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,840
With a good dowry and land,

764
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,440
Haode won't lack a good match.

765
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,920
Haode,

766
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,040
you said that Mr. Shen,

767
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,240
though cold,

768
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,280
is a gentleman.

769
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,640
If we take the land

770
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,360
and cut all ties with him,
what do you think?

771
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,960
<i>The Shen family</i>

772
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,080
<i>is not someone we can afford.</i>

773
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:36,320
<i>It's fine if you're just</i>
<i>daydreaming about it yourself.</i>

774
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,960
<i>But if we really let a matchmaker</i>
<i>go to their house,</i>

775
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,360
<i>you'll make us the laughingstock.</i>

776
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,680
<i>Yes, this wasn't my wish.</i>

777
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,600
- Qingshi.
- Master?

778
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,640
Get a sedan chair.

779
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,400
- Send her back.
- Sure.

780
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,320
Growing up,

781
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,080
I wasn't as talented as Shouhua

782
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,200
or as beautiful and decisive as Fuhui.

783
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,600
I wasn't as smart
or good with words like Kangning.

784
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,880
Even Leshan's is more lovable than me.

785
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,800
But this is the first time
I've been humiliated.

786
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,160
If I give up now,
I'd never forgive myself.

787
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,560
Who compares their weaknesses

788
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,120
to someone else's strengths?

789
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,680
If you want to compare,

790
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,960
Leshan wouldn't dare go to court with Mom.

791
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,720
Oh, my dear Haode.

792
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,920
Seems you really care for him.

793
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,880
You never compliment me like this.

794
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,520
Leshan.

795
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,320
You're being foolish.

796
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,240
Keep making mistakes
and it'll be stubbornness.

797
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,320
A young girl's youth mustn't be wasted.

798
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,360
Haode's so charming and sweet and honest.

799
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,120
No one sees her coming.

800
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,560
Shen Huizhao rejected three marriages.

801
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,320
He can't always use land
to make up for it.

802
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,520
Silly sister,

803
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,240
you've got a face that can't lie,

804
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,000
and when you cry, it's so cute.

805
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,920
Is that your strength?

806
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,640
Are you praising me?

807
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,400
If you really care for him,

808
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,080
let's figure out how to get him.

809
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,160
The daughters of the Li family
succeed in business,

810
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,520
win lawsuits, and even charm men.

811
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,120
Show him the same courage
you have in court.

812
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,360
Don't let him think he can do anything.

813
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,040
If he falls into your hands,
he'll have to obey you.

814
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,800
With Haode,

815
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,440
I don't think so.

816
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,080
Haode, how about this?

817
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,800
Let's do a bet.

818
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,880
If you can't tame him,

819
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,640
I'll take one of the lands you win.

820
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,440
You'll be my little sister from now on.

821
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,400
I've always been the youngest.

822
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,360
I'll get to play the big sister role.

823
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,320
Dream on.

824
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,000
Just watch me.

825
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,640
I'll get it done.

826
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,000
Trust me.

827
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,600
Just follow your heart.

828
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,240
You all love causing trouble.

829
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,160
SHEN MANSION

830
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,400
Mom, you look well today.

831
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,520
What did I tell you?

832
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,440
Even if he tries to avoid it,

833
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,600
once the bride enters,

834
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,560
they'll be a perfect couple.

835
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,400
In a year or two,

836
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,680
I'll have a great-grandchild.

837
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:57,960
Master.

838
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,200
The old lady's waiting for tea ritual.

839
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,440
She's up at dawn.

840
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,840
Mom.

841
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,480
The bride's from a humble family,

842
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,960
so her manners might not be perfect.

843
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,280
I think we should
let Liu teach her some more first.

844
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,560
Then she can greet you here.

845
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,640
There's no one else here.

846
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,640
No need for formalities.

847
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,440
Right, right.

848
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,120
Old Lady, Master, young master's here.

849
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,120
Granny.

850
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,920
Father.

851
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,920
Why are you alone?

852
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,400
Aren't you going

853
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,840
to call the bride
to greet your grandmother?

854
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,680
I'm not un-filial.

855
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,000
I didn't want to upset you.

856
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,840
I've already set my vow.

857
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,400
I can't eat my words and waste her time.

858
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,920
Last night,
I already told her and sent her home.

859
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,480
Please forgive me for reporting late.

860
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,720
You…

861
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,520
- Old lady.
- Mom.

862
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,520
- Old lady.
- Granny.

863
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,360
Mom.

864
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,520
You didn't even try to cover up.

865
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,840
Sending her back mid-way,

866
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,320
you've gone too far.

867
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,120
Long life to you, Granny.

868
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,840
I've come to greet you.

869
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,200
Dad, long life.

870
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,520
Husband.

871
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,120
You…

872
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,960
Didn't you go home?

873
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,080
I didn't inform Granny and Dad beforehand.

874
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,960
Even with my husband's orders,

875
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,600
I can't act on my own.

876
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,240
Good child, come here.

877
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,840
Bright eyes,

878
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,720
graceful features,

879
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,360
full forehead, rounded chin.

880
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,760
You can't help but like her.

881
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,240
Granny, about this--

882
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:04,000
Sending Haode away means sending my life.

883
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,760
Don't talk about medicine.

884
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:12,280
Even dragon meat from the sky won't help.

885
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,880
If you dare speak against me,

886
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,800
you'll be disowned.

887
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,160
You won't be a part of the Shen family.

888
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,040
Don't worry.

889
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,880
As long as I'm alive,

890
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,920
no one will dare chase you away.

891
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:29,840
Sure.

892
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,720
Li Haode, what do you want?

893
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,720
Leaving on the wedding day,
people will blame me.

894
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,120
I can't take this insult.

895
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,160
You can treat me as a wife,

896
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,840
living with you day by day.

897
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,880
If I can change your heart,

898
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,360
we'll be a good couple.

899
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,600
If not, will you stay with us forever?

900
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,160
- Let's set a deadline. Three years.
- One year.

901
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,360
Just one year.

902
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,600
At that time,

903
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,800
I'll prepare dowry for you
to marry someone else.

904
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,120
You must keep your promise.

905
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,560
You can't change your mind.

906
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,720
- Two years.
- Six months.

907
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,640
- Eighteen.
- Three.

908
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,920
Okay, fine. One year. Thank you.

909
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,480
I don't believe I can't win you over.

910
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,600
Let's see how long your pride lasts.

911
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:25,920
Mrs. Shen.

912
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,240
Master's busy this month.

913
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,600
He'll be staying in the study.

914
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,040
I was told to pack up.

915
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,520
I don't want to delay his work.

916
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,480
Go ahead.

917
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,440
No need to trouble you. Let me do it.

918
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,520
It's no trouble at all.

919
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,760
Thank you, my lady.

920
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,560
Look at this.

921
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,240
It's like he's guarding against me.

922
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,320
He won't even step inside the room.

923
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,680
As if I'll eat him alive.

924
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,800
I told you not to come, yet you insisted.

925
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,440
It's not that. Mom's worried
their family's powerful,

926
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,080
that you might be mistreated.

927
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,560
I'm here to help you gain strength.

928
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,920
Don't worry.

929
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,120
The Shen family doesn't know me,

930
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,120
so don't be afraid.

931
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,920
Just don't cause trouble,
then I'll be grateful.

932
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,400
You can stay here,
but do not cause trouble.

933
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,520
The Shen family has strict rules,
lots of customs.

934
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,880
If I didn't come,

935
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,400
your efforts might have been in vain.

936
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,360
I've gathered some useful info

937
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,840
because of my little tricks.

938
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,920
The Shen family has four branches,

939
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,320
but the eldest is the legitimate heir.

940
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,880
The others live separately.

941
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:20,040
The eldest has one son,
your troublesome husband.

942
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,120
His two older brothers passed away,

943
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,120
and his granny had no choice

944
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,680
but to follow the old custom,
sending him to the temple.

945
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,520
I see.

946
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,440
Exactly.

947
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,040
The eldest branch has no heirs,

948
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,640
so who will inherit the Shen family?

949
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,680
It must be troubling for the old lady.

950
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,640
If it were me,

951
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,320
I'd lose sleep too.

952
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,160
What's the plan moving forward?

953
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,200
The Li family's teachings are clear.

954
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:59,080
We must focus and act when the time comes.

955
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,520
I watch my sisters closely.

956
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,120
I'll follow their example,
even if just a bit.

957
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,160
When did our family have such teachings?

958
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,880
Mom always said,

959
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,800
if you see something good, take it.

960
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,560
Don't let others get it first.

961
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:23,680
We used to sleep in the same bed
and still do.

962
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,520
We are close enemies, aren't we?

963
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,720
Let's sleep.

964
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,360
