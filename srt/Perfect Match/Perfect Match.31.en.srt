EPISODE 31

2
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,000
Lady Jieyu bestowed upon me a golden rod.

3
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,200
It's glistening gold and very beautiful.

4
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,560
However, we can only look at it secretly.

5
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,760
You must not snitch.

6
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,400
It will be fine
if your own mother knows it.

7
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,200
It's bestowed by the imperial house
and represents the supreme glory.

8
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,320
Well, now,

9
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,680
she only cares about her son-in-law.
There's no room for me in her heart.

10
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,880
If she knows the use of this rod,

11
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
she will make a fuss.

12
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,000
Don't be so childish.

13
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,280
Mother is kind to your husband
because she wants him to be nice to you.

14
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,880
If he dares to treat me badly,
I will smash his head with a punch.

15
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,720
Let's go. It's right ahead.

16
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,640
I made a new dress.

17
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,600
I made one for you too.

18
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,840
I see.

19
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,280
Wear it when you go to meet him.

20
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,320
It'll be perfect.

21
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,600
- My lady.
- Haven't I said before

22
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,840
that without my permission,
you are not allowed to enter?

23
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,160
My lady, I usually clean at this hour.

24
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,400
The past two days, as the young master
was ill, I didn't want to disturb…

25
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,840
- My lady, please forgive me.
- It's a trivial matter. Calm down.

26
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,560
Aren't you going to show me
something nice?

27
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,720
You were looking for this, weren't you?

28
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,440
My lady.

29
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,400
I have a guest today.

30
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,520
I'll question you later. Now get out.

31
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,680
Yes.

32
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,120
- You may leave too.
- Yes.

33
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,360
You're smart.
Where on earth did you hide it?

34
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,760
It's the tradition of the Li family.

35
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,400
- Under the bed.
- Under the bed.

36
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Are you waiting for someone?

37
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,160
You scared me.

38
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,560
Isn't that obvious?

39
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,440
You're truly kind-hearted.

40
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,840
Losing a golden rod isn't a big deal.

41
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,840
The imperial house
will not punish her for that.

42
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,320
She will inevitably panic for a while.

43
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,920
It's better than watching her
parading around arrogantly, isn't it?

44
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
In my opinion,

45
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
there is a better way.

46
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,800
It was my mother who came.
Why were you so eager to flatter her?

47
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,000
Besides, with your leg broken,
you should've stayed put.

48
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,920
None of your Li family is good.

49
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,920
Only your mother
treats me with genuine care.

50
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,440
I was showing her respect, not you.

51
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,960
What did you say?

52
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,480
Say it again.

53
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,200
Otherwise, how did my leg get hurt?

54
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,440
So, according to you,
everyone in your family is a good person?

55
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
In my family,
there isn't even a single person.

56
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,000
Yang Xian, how can you be so ungrateful?

57
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,280
Let alone the others.

58
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,360
Your mother has always
treated you well, hasn't she?

59
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,800
Since I broke my leg,

60
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,840
has she actually come to see
or look after me?

61
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,560
She's busy
establishing authority over you.

62
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,920
How much do you understand
of the Yang family's people and affairs?

63
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,120
Naive.

64
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,560
My lord, my lady.

65
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,320
What's with the rush?
Has something happened?

66
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,240
Yinping killed herself
by jumping into the well.

67
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,200
- What exactly happened?
- Take her body away.

68
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,760
Are you sure it's Yinping?

69
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,440
Madam, it's indeed Yinping.

70
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,840
Her body was discovered half an hour ago
by the cleaning lady.

71
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,680
Where's Li Leshan?
Why hasn't she come over yet?

72
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,320
Her maid died in such a suspicious manner.

73
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,080
She hasn't even come over.

74
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,880
That's so inappropriate.

75
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,080
Mother, perhaps she's feeling guilty.

76
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,400
Zhuniang, don't talk nonsense
without evidence.

77
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,720
Sister, not everyone in this world
talks with evidence like you.

78
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,680
Just think about Yinping's background.

79
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,800
Her family lives hand-to-mouth
by smashing encrinite

80
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,000
for the store on West Street.

81
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,280
The whole family is relying
on this pretty daughter.

82
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,000
And now, she's dead, just like that.

83
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,240
Her mother is famously quarrelsome.

84
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,160
Go, call Li Leshan immediately. Hurry.

85
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,280
Yes.

86
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,760
Madam wants Lady Li in the garden at once.

87
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,680
Hurry to notify her.

88
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,680
My lady has already gone to bed.

89
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,040
I dare not disturb her.

90
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,200
You dare not listen to Madam's words?

91
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,200
I'm timid.

92
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,280
Perhaps you should try.

93
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,680
- I--
- I'm afraid of angering my lady

94
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,800
and can't escape a beating.

95
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,960
Didn't you hear that?

96
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,440
Li Leshan?

97
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,800
The tea is by your hand.

98
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,120
The towel is under your pillow.

99
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,840
With external and internal medicine taken,

100
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,120
if you want a massage,
ask Qiansheng for it.

101
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,000
A maid died in the mansion.
How can you still sleep?

102
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,160
I can't sleep.

103
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,440
But I neither beat her nor scolded her.
I have a clear conscience.

104
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,640
If she was truly murdered by someone,

105
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,920
the one who should be unable
to sleep tonight is the murderer.

106
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Alright. Go to sleep and stop nagging.

107
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,640
It's not someone else.
It's your maid, Yinping, who died.

108
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,240
Hopefully, tomorrow,
you can still sleep without worries.

109
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,440
<i>Although he's a scoundrel,</i>
<i>his words do make sense.</i>

110
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,280
<i>Her sudden death</i>
<i>has nothing to do with me,</i>

111
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,240
<i>but others will surely take advantage</i>
<i>of this to implicate me.</i>

112
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,880
<i>Now that it has come to this,</i>

113
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,160
<i>I might as well use the strategy of delay.</i>

114
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,960
<i>I will slowly plan</i>
<i>and think of a strategy.</i>

115
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,280
Steward Yang, what's the matter?

116
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,880
These people

117
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,000
are all from the Li family.
They won't listen to us.

118
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,400
I know they're from the Li family.

119
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,280
I'm asking you how you dare let them go.

120
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,760
I…

121
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,000
Go and stop her quickly.

122
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,320
Zhuniang, this is not appropriate.

123
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,680
Yinping died a suspicious death.
Li Leshan is running early in the morning.

124
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,480
It's obvious she has a guilty conscience.
We must stop her right now.

125
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,760
If you don't dare to go, I will.

126
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,760
Lady Zhuniang.

127
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,720
Li Leshan, come out.

128
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,080
What do you want, Zhuniang?

129
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,880
Where are you going?

130
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,480
A sister from my maternal home
will have a matchmaking in Sifu House.

131
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,600
I'm going to help her out.
What's wrong with that?

132
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,840
You speak of it lightly.

133
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
There is a human life on you.

134
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,920
I think you want to run away.

135
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,360
What?

136
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,280
Who are you trying to scare?

137
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,480
Heaven can tell good from evil
and right from wrong.

138
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,080
Sooner or later, we'll know
who should be responsible for that life.

139
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,040
I'm the eldest daughter-in-law
of the Yang family who married properly.

140
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,040
Going out to visit my maternal home
is not a big deal.

141
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,920
If you want to say more, you can say it
when I return in the evening.

142
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,720
Let's go.

143
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,360
Follow up.

144
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,680
Steward Yang.

145
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,640
- Yes?
- Steward Yang.

146
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,160
It's not proper
to let the bride go out alone.

147
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,120
Assign some people
to accompany and guard her.

148
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,880
- I--
- Stop that. Quickly follow her.

149
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,360
If Li Leshan doesn't return by dusk,
I'll hold you accountable.

150
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,400
Yes.

151
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,120
All of you, get the horses and follow me.

152
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,000
And you too. Why didn't you stop her?

153
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,720
Zhuniang, when bestowing the golden rod,
the imperial house said

154
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,880
she could even beat her elders with it.

155
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,720
If I were to intervene,
wouldn't I be asking for embarrassment?

156
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,560
It's all Yueniang's fault
for helping an outsider.

157
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,600
Zhuniang.

158
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,000
Sifu House is right
on Pan Restaurant Street.

159
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,880
They open the door
to do business every day.

160
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,560
If she runs away,
the entire Li family can't.

161
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,840
Alright.

162
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,160
We still have important matters
to attend to.

163
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,400
She is really dead?

164
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,800
Yes.

165
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,960
Leshan, be honest with me.

166
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,640
Have you ever beaten or scolded her?

167
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,440
Mom.

168
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,000
Mother, don't wrongly blame Leshan.

169
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,080
I was there that day too.

170
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,120
Leshan simply reprimanded her a bit
and told her to leave.

171
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,880
Who knew she would jump
into a well and die?

172
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,840
- It truly was an undeserved disaster.
- Thankfully, you stand as my witness.

173
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,360
Even my own mother has suspicions,
let alone others.

174
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,920
I'm not afraid of being cursed by others,

175
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,680
but I can't bear injustices
and grievances.

176
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,560
I fear this matter won't end well,
so I specially invited Haode here.

177
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,200
What do you want me to do?

178
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,640
You often review case files
with your husband.

179
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,560
The laws of Song
and the old cases of Kaifeng

180
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,280
are all in your mind.

181
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,800
Tell me.

182
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,120
If this case falls
into your husband's hands,

183
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,600
how would he adjudicate it?

184
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,160
Has the other party filed a lawsuit?

185
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,440
While teaching me chess,
Shouhua often says

186
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,520
you think three moves ahead
for every one they make.

187
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,960
If I understand the rules,
no matter what my opponent does,

188
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,560
I can handle it well.

189
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,760
Alright, I will tell you all of it.

190
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,840
How this case is judged depends
on the reason for the maid's death.

191
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,000
Was she beaten to death by someone?

192
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,960
Was she oppressed and forced to death?

193
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,960
Or did she commit suicide out of anger?

194
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,600
YANG MANSION

195
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,880
Not bad. Yi, your studies
have improved even a lot more.

196
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,920
Father, I follow your teachings
and dare not slacken in the least.

197
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,520
Sadly, my talents are dull,
and progress is limited.

198
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,840
I'm afraid of disappointing you.

199
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,440
No need for undue self-deprecation.

200
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,480
Your teacher mentioned to me yesterday,

201
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,360
that if you work hard for another year,
you'll be ready to take the exams.

202
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,240
When you become a Jinshi,
you'll not only honor our ancestors,

203
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,600
but also bring honor to me.

204
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,240
Understood.

205
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,960
Father-in-law,

206
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,040
Yinping's family heard
that their daughter died.

207
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,520
They're wailing outside the gate.

208
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,520
You can't even handle
such a trivial matter.

209
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,200
A maid is dead. So be it.

210
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,600
Who gave them the audacity

211
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,440
to make a scene at my doorstep?
Quickly drive them away.

212
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,120
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,000
For such a rascally, inferior family,

214
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,040
we're not afraid of their commotion.

215
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,280
It's just that now,
they have a handle against us,

216
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,840
and exposing it would disgrace our name.
So, I dare not keep the matter from you.

217
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,560
But I'm also afraid it will enrage you…

218
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,840
What's with the hesitating?
What happened exactly?

219
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,320
Go.

220
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,280
Call that terrible son over here at once.

221
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,800
When I dressed my daughter
in her burial clothes,

222
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,480
I felt swelling in her lower abdomen.

223
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,960
I asked Liu San, the coroner, for help.
We found out she was pregnant.

224
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,400
My poor daughter died
with a child in her womb.

225
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,320
She must have been forced to death.

226
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,800
Nonsense.

227
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,720
Haven't I promised you
200 strings of coins to properly bury her?

228
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,120
If you continue to make a fuss,

229
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,160
I'll have you tied up and taken
to the authorities for extortion.

230
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,800
No, we have never wanted the money.

231
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,680
We lived a poor life.

232
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,400
We had to pawn her off for ten years
of servitude to the Yang family,

233
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,080
hoping that she would end up
in a good place.

234
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,840
Unexpectedly, it cost my daughter
her life instead.

235
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,960
Although she was a humble commoner,

236
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,400
she was not a lifelong maid.

237
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,280
The contract clearly states
that upon the completion of ten years,

238
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,320
she must be returned to her parents,
safe and sound.

239
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,080
We bear not to see
our daughter die in vain.

240
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,400
That's why we've kept the body unburied.

241
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,320
We mustered the courage to come
to your mansion to seek justice

242
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,600
and find out who tarnished my daughter.

243
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,000
I beg you, my lord,
give us an explanation.

244
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,400
And that way,

245
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,360
when my poor daughter
is buried some other day,

246
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,600
she can have a proper status.

247
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,280
Father, did you call me here

248
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,560
to see this farce?

249
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,560
At this point, you still dare
make excuses and put on an act?

250
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,760
Confess to the sins you've done.

251
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,040
What do you want me to say?

252
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,960
Look.

253
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,320
Xian, quickly kneel and admit your fault.

254
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,200
Let's all discuss
and find a good solution.

255
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,440
It's most urgent
to cover up this disgrace.

256
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,120
If it gets out,

257
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,240
forcing a maid to death won't sound good.

258
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,760
Don't you care
about the reputation of our family?

259
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,920
Huh?

260
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,200
Did you see with your own eyes
that I did it? You have no place to talk.

261
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,840
You rascal! Whenever you make a mistake,
it's your brother-in-law

262
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,720
who runs around,
trying to mediate for you.

263
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
How dare you blame him?

264
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,280
I am your own sister.

265
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,760
Even I won't bother to cover for you.

266
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,360
When Yinping served you,
she was nothing but proper.

267
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,400
You must have taken a fancy to her,

268
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,240
but she was unyielding.

269
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,920
Therefore, she was forced by you
and got pregnant, which led to her death.

270
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,800
Xian, don't blame me for saying this.

271
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,240
We are a respectable family.

272
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
We've never had
such absurd and disgraceful affairs.

273
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,520
If it spreads, it won't just be
our family's reputation that suffers.

274
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,760
Even your third sister in the palace
would be implicated.

275
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,520
They seem honest and decent to me.

276
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,960
They just want to prove their daughter's
innocence, with no intention to smear.

277
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,800
If you did it, then admit it.

278
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,840
Father and Mother will help you.

279
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,400
Why blame him? It's all Li Leshan's fault.

280
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,600
She's arrogant and fierce,
unable to tolerate others.

281
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,440
She's driven all the maids
out of her room.

282
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,320
It must be her who drove Yinping

283
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,560
to death out of jealousy.

284
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,880
Every wrong has a perpetrator.

285
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,480
If you want someone to pay
with their life, go to Li Leshan.

286
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,680
If you want to take it to the authorities,
just go ahead and sue her.

287
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,520
It has nothing to do with my son.

288
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,760
I've said it. I didn't do it.

289
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,840
My poor daughter!

290
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,320
If you're watching this in heaven,

291
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,560
don't let the real culprit go unpunished.

292
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,120
You live a promiscuous life
with absurd words and deeds. You…

293
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,960
You were really out of line.

294
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,960
I can almost hear the sound
of scheming in your minds.

295
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,720
On the surface, you speak in unison,
conspiring to frame me,

296
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,480
but you all know well in your hearts
what your true intentions are.

297
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,600
Indeed, I can't defend myself.
I'm all alone with little power,

298
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,480
and even my own mother won't believe me.

299
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,640
But I will never admit
to something I haven't done.

300
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,880
Just listen to him.

301
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,120
He is so shameless.

302
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,040
He's a beast without a conscience.

303
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,120
Such a rebellious son

304
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,120
will sooner or later
squander our family fortune.

305
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,840
I might as well beat him to death today

306
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,240
to spare our family the disgrace

307
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,120
and future calamity on the entire clan!

308
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,320
Master!

309
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,480
- Xian!
- Father-in-law!

310
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,520
Father, calm your anger.

311
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,480
- Mother?
- Father-in-law.

312
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,520
Father, calm your anger.

313
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,560
Even if Xian made a mistake,
he is still your son.

314
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,520
Father-in-law, Xian has made
a grave mistake in his youthful folly.

315
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,080
You can take your time teaching him.

316
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,160
Admit your mistake. Do you really
want to be driven out of the house?

317
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,240
You little beast,
if you don't admit your mistake,

318
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,800
you can get out right now.

319
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,080
Let alone I have you as my son.

320
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,120
Even if you were my only son,

321
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,560
I'd rather the Yang family line
end with me

322
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,760
than have the family humiliated
and ruined in the future.

323
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,560
- Father!
- Xian!

324
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,560
Your father is doing this for your good.
Just admit your mistake.

325
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,080
I will find a way.
I'll definitely save you.

326
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,320
So, all of you have decided I did it.

327
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,440
Then, what difference does it make
whether I admit it or not?

328
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,360
Why still ask me pretentiously?

329
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,240
Move!

330
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,360
No!

331
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,680
It's so lively here. Why wasn't I invited?

332
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,960
You…

333
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,560
Don't admit to anything
that you haven't done.

334
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,000
How dare you come back?

335
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,640
It's all because of you, a shrew,
meddling in everything.

336
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,320
After being tormented by you,
Yinping killed herself out of despair.

337
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,600
- Take a good look at her.
- What?

338
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,600
She is the real culprit
who caused your daughter's death.

339
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,680
Return my daughter's life to me.

340
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,640
Get away.

341
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,640
My poor daughter,

342
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,320
I'm willing to risk my life
to seek justice for you,

343
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,800
but they are so powerful.

344
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,320
I don't want to live anymore.

345
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,440
Silence.

346
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,760
That's all you've got?
Who do you think you can fool?

347
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,880
Weren't you taking it to the authorities?
I've done that for you.

348
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,840
- Taking it…
- To the authorities?

349
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,360
What authorities did you take it to?

350
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,640
According to the laws of Song,
when a servant is at fault,

351
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,880
if their master kills them without suing,
the master shall be caned 100 times.

352
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,960
If it isn't the servant's fault,
the master's imprisoned for a year.

353
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,240
If Yinping was forced to death
by her master and mistress,

354
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,960
your crying and making a fuss here
isn't proper and won't help.

355
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,680
I've filed a complaint on your behalf.

356
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,600
If I, Li Leshan, really killed her,

357
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,800
I'd pay with my life.

358
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,320
Xian,

359
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,520
my daughter is not afraid.
Dare you sue or not?

360
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,000
If I killed Yinping, the authorities
could decide my punishment.

361
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,640
Have you all heard that?

362
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,080
Whether Yinping was pregnant

363
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,640
was not up to your neighbor,
be it Zhang San or Liu San.

364
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,840
Let's take the corpse to the authorities
and have their coroner examine it.

365
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,560
My mother is right.

366
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,280
Who's the father of Yinping's child?
Why didn't she tell her mistress about it?

367
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,280
How did I abuse her?
Did she have any injuries on her body?

368
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,480
Why did she jump into the well?
Who are the witnesses?

369
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,360
Let's find out all the answers
in the court.

370
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,040
I, Li Leshan, won't even blink an eye.

371
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,720
If someone falsely accuses me of crimes
without evidence or official involvement,

372
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,320
I must sue them for slander and deceit
and have them sentenced to exile.

373
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,400
Father-in-law, well…

374
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,800
Mother, if a decent young wife
has been brought before the court,

375
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,600
causing a scene known all over town,
it will be a joke to outsiders.

376
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,320
It's better to settle this privately
and cover it up with money.

377
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,960
What do you think, Yueniang?

378
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,680
Well…

379
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,920
Clean your face.

380
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,160
Well…

381
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,000
I don't want to be involved.

382
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,920
Qiansheng. Qiansheng.

383
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,080
My lady, my lord.

384
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,760
Have someone take them back
to wait for the official summons.

385
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,760
If they keep making a fuss
and the Yang family can't handle it,

386
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,840
there are military patrols on the streets

387
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,080
who allow no chaos.

388
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,400
What are you waiting for?
Didn't you hear my wife's order?

389
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,680
- Take them away.
- You…

390
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,400
You… Is there no justice in this world?

391
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,640
My poor daughter!

392
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,080
- Is there justice?
- Where is the justice?

393
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,840
- Where is the justice?
- Well…

394
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,680
What an ugly scene!

395
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,480
This is all your fault, you un-filial son.

396
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,840
What a misfortune upon our family!

397
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,280
You are a foolish father.

398
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,880
When others wrongly accused your son,

399
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,800
you didn't speak up to clear his name,

400
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,600
nor did you call the servants to testify.

401
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,840
Instead, you beat and scolded him.

402
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,880
Is he even your own son?

403
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,800
Obviously, he is a thorn in your side

404
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,960
that you can't wait to get rid of.

405
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,360
I didn't expect there to be a father
like you in this world.

406
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,400
- You foo--
- That's right.

407
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,080
You are beyond foolish.

408
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,200
Madam Li,

409
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,280
since ancient times,
beating can bring up filial sons.

410
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,480
My father-in-law is simply
deeply concerned for his son.

411
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,080
Right.

412
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,200
I'm also deeply concerned for you.

413
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,960
I…

414
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,560
How do you know it was he who did it?

415
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,320
- It might very well be you.
- I…

416
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,920
Is it you?

417
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,240
It could be you, a shameless old man.

418
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,360
You…

419
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,520
There is a whole household
of young male servants too.

420
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,040
Anyone that is not castrated

421
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,320
could be the suspect.

422
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,240
Why do you target him only?

423
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,560
He is now my Li family's son-in-law
and as good as my own son.

424
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,960
I won't allow you to mistreat him.

425
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,080
- Leshan.
- Yes.

426
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,480
Take your husband. Let's go home.
We don't need to bear their nonsense.

427
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,400
Okay.

428
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,840
Mother-in-law,
thank you for your kindness.

429
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,960
It's just that every little bit

430
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,560
of the Yang family's fortune
was hard-earned by my grandfather.

431
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,800
Grandfather declared on his deathbed

432
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,080
that all those ancestral houses,
shops, and fields

433
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,960
would be left to me, his eldest grandson.

434
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,480
You un-filial son.

435
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,600
I am not yet dead.

436
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,000
How dare you speak those words?

437
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,440
When others wronged your son,
you didn't even gasp.

438
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,880
So, you, as a father,
have come back to life now?

439
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,360
- You…
- What?

440
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,480
All of you, listen to me.

441
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,680
As long as I live another day,

442
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,720
I am the rightful heir to the Yang family.

443
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,160
As for some of you, no matter
whose power you wield

444
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,880
and what ulterior motives
you harbor in secret,

445
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,600
beware, for committing too much evil
invites divine condemnation.

446
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,680
Let's go.

447
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,080
I…

448
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,760
Your whole family reeks of wickedness.

449
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,520
A bunch of muddle-headed fools!
Who are you?

450
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,440
- Nothing.
- You--

451
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,040
Right, you are beyond foolish.
Keep that to yourself.

452
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,920
Father-in-law, they…

453
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,440
What a shrew!

454
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,320
Well…

455
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,680
The entire Yang family will be yours.
That inevitably invites jealousy.

456
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,240
And your mother is at fault too.

457
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,960
She's easily swayed.

458
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,400
She can easily be fooled by others.

459
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,920
She is not even considerate
of her own son.

460
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,440
But I still have a mother-in-law
who cares for me.

461
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,520
What are you waiting for?

462
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,480
My lord, come on. Let me…

463
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,000
Let me apply the medicine for you.
Just bear with the pain a little.

464
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,840
Tut.

465
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,240
Thank you, Leshan.

466
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,880
Just remember it.
It'll have to be repaid someday.

467
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,360
Don't move.

468
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,160
I mean, you're welcome.

469
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,560
- This is what I should do.
- That's more like it.

470
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,960
Well, it's so late.

471
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,560
In the night market, there must be

472
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,040
many customers in our store.

473
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,920
I have to head back now.

474
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,720
Xian, rest well.

475
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,320
I'm leaving now.

476
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,440
- Let me see you off.
- No need. Stay seated.

477
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,880
No need for politeness amongst family.

478
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,560
Should you need any help later on,

479
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,040
come to me at the Sifu House.

480
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,240
I will definitely not let off
those treacherous people.

481
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,240
I'll keep that in mind.

482
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,120
- Qiansheng.
- Yes, my lord?

483
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,960
- Get the carriage ready.
- Yes.

484
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,800
Then I'm off.

485
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,360
Leshan, take good care of him.

486
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,720
Make sure he isn't bullied again.

487
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,760
I know, Mom. Rest assured.

488
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,680
Just go.

489
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,880
Turn around.

490
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,000
Why did you help me?

491
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,920
Don't be silly.

492
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,280
Although you and I are not a true couple,

493
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,880
others won't care.

494
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,800
We are in the same boat now.

495
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,760
Once they've taken you down,
they'll go after me.

496
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,280
Just wait. This matter is far from over.

497
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,480
I will catch the troublemaker behind this

498
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,640
and tear his mouth apart.

499
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,400
What do you plan to do?

500
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,600
Do you know why I went against
that Jiang woman tonight?

501
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,560
You did it on purpose?

502
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,000
- Come on in.
- Okay.

503
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,120
My lord, I have something important
to report.

504
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,560
- Come in.
- Yes.

505
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,200
As the lady predicted, when it was past
the second watch of the night,

506
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,640
servant Liu Gui went straight
to the Zhang family.

507
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,160
Which Liu Gui?

508
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,960
My lord, you may not know.

509
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,320
He used to carry the sedan and do
miscellaneous tasks outside the main gate.

510
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,480
Six months ago,
he was promoted to the second lady.

511
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,560
He runs errands,
transmitting messages indoors and out.

512
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,240
He's the one who often follows
Zhuniang's husband.

513
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,200
It really is him.

514
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,960
He exchanged looks
with them during the day.

515
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,160
He doesn't look like a good fellow at all.

516
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,480
They're brewing another plot
since the previous one failed.

517
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,840
How much wealth does your family
really have to make him so envious?

518
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,360
I guess

519
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,000
it's enough to open another
hundred or so Sifu House shops.

520
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,600
What?

521
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,160
Well, Young Master Yang,

522
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,160
why do I suddenly

523
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,360
find you so handsome when looking at you?

524
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,840
You don't seem so repulsive anymore.

525
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,880
My dear wife,
what are you upset about now?

526
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,320
Don't think I don't know

527
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,880
that you've been sneaking around
with that flirtatious woman.

528
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,520
Are you the father

529
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,880
of the child in her belly?

530
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,120
I did it to find out news about Yang Xian.

531
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,800
I've never touched her in private.

532
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,120
The pregnancy

533
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,080
is just a pretext for the Zhang family
to extort money.

534
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,280
It's completely fake.

535
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,400
If they really bring her to court
for an autopsy,

536
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,240
she would be terrified out of her wits.

537
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,760
Aren't they afraid
of such a big lie being exposed?

538
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,160
Respect for the dead is paramount.

539
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,560
Isn't it just a matter
of spending a bit more money?

540
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,680
Unless they're willing
to sacrifice the reputation of the family,

541
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,080
who would have her body examined?

542
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,640
Your good-for-nothing brother
is always disliked.

543
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,400
Even if he were to lay bare his heart,
no one would believe him.

544
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,520
If it weren't for Li Leshan
and her mother showing up,

545
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,720
he wouldn't have escaped so easily.

546
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,600
So, you didn't push Yinping into the well

547
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,040
to frame my brother intentionally?

548
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,240
Where is this coming from?

549
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,920
I have been so diligent
in passing on messages.

550
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,240
You promised to buy a house and servants
for me and take me as your concubine.

551
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,320
Wait a bit longer. Now is not the time.

552
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,120
More waiting? I've been waiting
for a year already.

553
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,840
Times have changed.

554
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,800
Young Master Young has married a shrew,
struggling to live every day.

555
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,600
I must see the deed to the house tomorrow.

556
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,120
If you don't agree,
I'll tell your wife about everything.

557
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,240
What's the hurry?

558
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,200
I'll do as you say.

559
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,720
But to deal with Yang Xian,

560
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,480
I need to borrow something from you.

561
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,880
I fear you are reluctant to part with it.

562
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,680
Even I am yours. Why would I be reluctant?

563
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,760
That's more like it.

564
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,760
When you first married me,

565
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,160
I was also from a distinguished family.

566
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,400
Later, because of my father's mishaps,
we both fell on hard times.

567
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,720
Over the years, the Yang family business
has flourished due to my hard work,

568
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,680
and it's even more prosperous than before.

569
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,320
Everyone admires and respects me for that.

570
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,400
Yet your grandfather
disdains me as an outsider.

571
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,920
He would rather give the family fortune
to that good-for-nothing.

572
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,360
If Yang Xian takes over the household
in the future,

573
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,360
as a married woman,
you can only follow me back to my family.

574
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,080
I'm not afraid of living in poverty.

575
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,040
I just fear it would be unfair to you.

576
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,560
No.

577
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,320
That's unacceptable.

578
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,040
Right?

579
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,520
Everything I've done

580
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,400
is all for the sake of our future.

581
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,760
You have to trust me.

582
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,440
You saw what happened today.

583
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,640
I hoped Father would kick him out.

584
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,680
But that Li Leshan is a brazen woman.

585
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,040
Normal women will be afraid
at the mention of a lawsuit.

586
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,760
Yet she dared
to file a lawsuit by herself.

587
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,680
If it really goes to the court,
the Zhangs won't dare confront her.

588
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,960
Her fourth brother-in-law in Kaifeng Court

589
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,920
can't be messed with.

590
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,960
She was just bluffing.

591
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,120
Zhuniang, do not worry. I will find a way

592
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,960
to vent your anger.

593
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,280
Last night, someone saw her shadow.

594
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,640
She's still in her pink top, green skirt,
and a begonia tucked by her temple.

595
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,800
We'd better believe in its existence.

596
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,720
Let's take it as seeking peace of mind.

597
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,680
Leshan.

598
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,520
OPEN AND ABOVE BOARD

599
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,920
Sisters,

600
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,920
why are there monks in the mansion?

601
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,240
Mother is a compassionate person.

602
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,880
Although, disliking the Zhangs
for causing a scene in our home,

603
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,800
she still pities Yinping

604
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,800
for dying at a young age.

605
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,320
Considering that she once
served this family,

606
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,640
Mother plans to hold offerings for her
and invite monks to conduct the rites.

607
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,160
The offerings will last a hundred days.

608
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,480
The master's family
is holding offerings for a maid?

609
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,440
Is there such a custom in Bianjing?

610
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,840
Leshan, it's better for you not to know.

611
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,160
You boast of fearing
neither heaven nor earth.

612
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,480
This is the rash and wild speech
due to inexperience.

613
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,760
Here is my kind advice.

614
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,600
Tomorrow is the seventh day
after Yinping's death.

615
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,760
You'd best stay behind closed doors
and not wander about.

616
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,720
If there's some mishap,
you'll have no one to blame.

617
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,680
Let's go, Yueniang.

618
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,360
I've already told you before.

619
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,280
Those evildoers will not let you off.

620
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,880
Yet you had to show off your strength.

621
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,080
Qiansheng, report the news
you've gathered to the lady.

622
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,720
Yes.

623
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,040
My lady, nowadays,
everyone on the streets…

624
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,960
is talking,

625
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,480
saying that you…

626
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,600
- They say--
- What do the blabbermouths say?

627
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,280
They say…

628
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,840
They say you're extremely jealous
and don't uphold the virtues of a wife.

629
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,520
A few days after you married,
you forced your husband's favored maid

630
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,360
to jump into a well
and die with an unborn child,

631
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,760
inviting the resentment of people
and the wrath of heaven.

632
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,160
How absurd!

633
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,360
Fine. They dare
not to confront me in court,

634
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,520
instead they scheme in every way
to ruin my reputation.

635
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,720
They even try to scare me by saying
Yinping's ghost will come back.

636
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,880
If I were to truly avoid it, that would be
admitting to a guilty conscience.

637
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,000
At that time, rumors would fly even more.

638
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,680
Yuzan, come here.

639
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,520
Come here.

640
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,120
Listen to me.

641
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,920
- Clean this spot.
- Okay.

642
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,360
OPEN AND ABOVE BOARD

643
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,880
Just put these on the table.

644
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,200
She fears neither heaven nor earth
and respects neither ghosts nor gods.

645
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,840
I have never seen such a rash woman.

646
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,520
It's simply ridiculous.

647
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,520
Sis, you are kindhearted.

648
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,520
But she is too audacious to appreciate it.

649
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,120
I advise you

650
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,960
not to meddle in others' affairs,
lest you become disliked.

651
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,440
It's now the Qingming Festival.
She shows no respect to the dead at all.

652
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,440
It's just like the old saying goes.

653
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:23,680
Heaven's misdeeds may be defied,
but one's own misdeeds can't be spared.

654
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,440
You…

655
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,320
Let's go.

656
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,320
Be gentle. It's my face, not tree bark.

657
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,160
My lady, everything is ready
as you ordered.

658
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,760
Alright, I'm off.

659
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,920
Where are you going?

660
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,080
It's too stuffy inside the room at night.

661
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,720
I had someone
set up a bamboo couch in the garden.

662
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,720
I'll go there to enjoy the fresh air
and the moon.

663
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,520
Li Leshan, now is not the time
for you to be combative.

664
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,760
Do you know they've set a trap
waiting for you to fall into it?

665
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,160
I stand no evildoers.

666
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,960
Nor will I allow them to bully me.

667
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,280
If someone dares plot against me
under my nose,

668
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,600
they'll have to pay dearly.

669
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,360
Leshan, stop.

670
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,760
You'd better not regret this.

671
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,880
Li Leshan, stop right there!

672
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,800
OPEN AND ABOVE BOARD

673
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,120
Qiansheng.

674
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,280
Qiansheng.

675
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,720
My lord, what order do you have?

676
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,440
Help me change my clothes.

677
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,720
My lord, it's so late.

678
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,040
Where are you going?
I'll have someone get the sedan ready.

679
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,240
No need.

680
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,560
Mind the steps.

681
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,640
You wicked woman,
a bat in chicken feathers!

682
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,160
You want to fool me?

683
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,200
Let alone you are a fake.
Even if you are the real one,

684
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,480
I'd still beat you senseless.

685
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,240
I'd like to see the rotten guts
inside you.

686
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,960
That's right.
She's possessed by an evil spirit.

687
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,200
Someone, come quickly!

688
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,640
Someone!

689
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,040
Seer Chou was attacked by her.

690
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,840
Hurry. Tie her up.

691
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,760
Who dares?

692
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,520
Is this appropriate?

693
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,800
The garden hasn't
been very peaceful lately.

694
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,600
We have invited Seer Chou
to dispel evil and pray for blessings.

695
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,200
Yet you attacked her.

696
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,320
No wonder you're speaking nonsense
and disrespecting the spirits.

697
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,320
It turns out
you're possessed by an evil spirit.

698
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,120
Dear Leshan, I am here to save you.

699
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,400
What are you waiting for? Take her down.

700
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,320
- Well…
- Well…

701
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,360
<i>So, it's not playing a ghost,</i>
<i>but catching a prey in the tray.</i>

702
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,560
<i>Then I'll counter your scheme against you</i>

703
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,040
<i>to make you reap what you have sown.</i>

704
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,960
Hurry up. What are you waiting for?

705
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:58,880
Well…

706
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,760
What's there to fear?
There are so many of us.

707
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,960
Can't we still take her down?

708
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,600
If we catch her, Lady Zhuniang
will reward us handsomely.

709
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,000
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

710
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,640
I've got her.

711
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,400
- Quick, take her down.
- Quick.

712
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,720
She is coming.

713
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,760
She's coming.

714
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,040
- Someone!
- Someone, help!

715
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,800
You and your husband first stole
the golden rod and then killed Yinping.

716
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,760
And now you're using her death
to intimidate us,

717
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,800
making the dead unable to rest in peace,
and causing unrest in the household.

718
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,320
Your evil can't be tolerated at all.

719
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,720
Even flaying and frying you alive
would not be enough.

720
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,280
Do you admit your guilt or not?

721
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,680
I admit my guilt. I do.

722
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,000
Sis, help! My lord, help!

723
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,200
- Stop hitting.
- Xian's wife has had a fit of madness.

724
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,880
Quickly stop her.

725
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,400
Who dares to lay a finger on my wife?

726
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,680
Touch her with your hands,
and I'll chop them off.

727
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,680
Your wife has gone mad.

728
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,280
How dare you further fan her flames?

729
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,480
Strange men and women
should not have physical contact.

730
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,760
If the male servants intrude
and disrespect the womenfolk,

731
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,080
it's a crime for disrespect.

732
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,800
Domestic or state laws
won't tolerate that.

733
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,240
Listen to me carefully.

734
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,800
Whoever dares to touch my wife,
I'll take his life.

735
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,920
I will shoulder this matter alone.

736
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,880
You needn't worry
about getting involved. Go.

737
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,880
Who is the real master of the Yang family?

738
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,560
Just think about it carefully first.

739
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,160
Help!

740
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,720
Zhuniang… Z-Zhuniang.

741
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,880
You have suffered.

742
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,800
My lord.

743
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,680
You are deeply sinful.

744
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,640
Normally, you must be beaten 100 times
before justice is served.

745
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,880
But considering you're a woman,
it's possible to spare you.

746
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,240
Let your husband take your place,
and I'll spare you the last 80.

747
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,320
Zhuniang, you must not trust her.

748
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,520
My husband loves me.
Eighty times is nothing to him.

749
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,480
E-Even 200 would be bearable.

750
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,400
Zhuniang is a delicate woman.

751
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,880
How can she endure such pain?

752
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,760
Brother-in-law, you're strong and healthy.

753
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,120
How can you stand by and not save her?

754
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,440
- Well…
- My lord, if you don't save me now,

755
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,320
I will be beaten to death.

756
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,440
I thought you were a couple deep in love,
but now it seems you are alone.

757
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,160
Your husband won't stand in for you.
So, don't blame me.

758
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:52,800
Zhuniang.

759
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,040
- Zhuniang.
- My lord, help!

760
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,160
Well…

761
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,400
Zhuniang.

762
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,280
Zhuniang. My poor sister.

763
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,760
I wish I could take your place.

764
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,480
Brother-in-law,

765
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,160
- you are too cold.
- I--

766
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,680
Will you just watch her suffer?

767
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,160
My lord, help!

768
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,800
My lord, help! My lord…

769
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,600
- Zhuniang? Zhuniang?
- Well…

770
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,240
Didn't you hear what my sisters said?

771
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,720
Whoever ties him up for me
gets a reward of one tael of silver.

772
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,120
Anyone who disobeys will be caned
20 times and kicked out of the house.

773
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,320
- Understood.
- Understood.

774
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,720
What are you doing? What are you doing?

775
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:38,920
Let me go.

776
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,920
Someone who's possessed
can't be reasoned with.

777
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,560
You'll have to suffer for your wife.

778
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,720
Beat him.

779
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,320
Yang Xian, you scoundrel!

780
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,440
- Good beating. Well done.
- Ouch, it hurts!

781
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,000
Beat him harder.

782
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,640
Haven't you eaten? Beat him hard.

783
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,400
Help! Help!

784
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,800
Ouch! Help!

785
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,520
Stop beating me.

786
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,560
Stop! All of you!

787
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,560
