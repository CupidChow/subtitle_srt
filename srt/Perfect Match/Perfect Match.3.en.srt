EPISODE 3

00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,480
SIFU HOUSE

3
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,600
I can't believe you.

4
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,880
Why are you being like this?

5
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,320
I kindly let you consign your zither here.

6
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,960
Now that the zither has been reserved

7
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,240
and the deposit has been paid,

8
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,680
you want to take it back?

9
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,920
What am I supposed to say to the buyer?

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,840
In three days, the buyer
will come with the money.

11
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,480
Can't you wait another three days?

12
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,400
I planned to stay in Bianjing
for two months

13
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,880
but ran out of money.
That's why the zither is for consignment.

14
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,600
I received a letter from home yesterday,

15
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,320
saying my mother has fallen ill
and is eagerly waiting for my return.

16
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,360
Let alone three days,
I can't wait one day more.

17
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,960
You seem to be educated.
How can you go back on your word?

18
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,120
We received the buyer's deposit
and waiting for them to pick up.

19
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,680
If we can't hand over the zither,

20
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,960
how can we continue to do business
on this street?

21
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,920
- I…
- That can't happen.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,480
I won't allow that.

23
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,680
- Give it to me.
- Stop that.

24
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,520
Well, Mr. Liao.

25
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,680
Why are you quarreling
with a customer in the street?

26
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,280
Madam.

27
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,760
- That man's outrageous. No credibility.
- Gentlemen, may I have your attention?

28
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,000
I put my zither Bingqing here temporarily
for consignment.

29
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,600
I don't want to sell it,
but they won't let me take it back.

30
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,240
I am the owner.

31
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,440
What they are doing is simply robbery!

32
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,880
Bingqing? Isn't it a Lei zither
from the Tang dynasty?

33
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,240
It's by the Lei family
in Shu prefecture.

34
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
Exactly. Please take a look.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It says, "On the third day of the third
lunar month of Dali Era's third year,

36
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,840
made by the Lei family in Shu prefecture."

37
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,320
It is indeed the genuine famous zither,
Bingqing.

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,240
- It's a fine zither.
- Madam.

39
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,520
- Can you--
- Here is the thing,

40
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,760
I thought that shabby zither

41
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,960
- was worth 30 strings.
- You shall see it for yourself.

42
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,280
But just yesterday, a rich customer came

43
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,480
and offered this amount right away.

44
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,080
- Fifty strings?
- Fifty?

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,480
No, 300 strings.

46
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,480
That shabby zither is worth 300 strings?

47
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,160
I heard the buyer has been collecting
items from 40 or 50 years ago

48
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,240
for the family of the Transport Envoy
of Guangdong.

49
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,120
He has also collected
many paintings and calligraphy arts.

50
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,680
He insisted on having this zither.

51
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,120
I told him that the seller
had made it clear beforehand

52
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,920
he wouldn't sell
if they don't appreciate it.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,040
We made a deal

54
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,720
that the seller must be notified
before the zither was picked up.

55
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,960
The buyer set the contract,

56
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,400
left 30 strings, and left.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,040
This shabby zither
isn't worth that much money.

58
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,120
Who are they trying to fool?

59
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,640
What the heart cherishes
can't be bought with a fortune.

60
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,280
This is my first time seeing Lei zither.

61
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,920
How about you sell it to me

62
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,080
for 40 strings?

63
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,600
- Forty?
- Sell it to me for 40 strings.

64
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,800
Sixty-five.

65
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,880
Sixty-eight.

66
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,920
- 68 is a good price.
- 80.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,920
- That's a lot.
- You…

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,920
- 100 strings.
- How much?

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,840
- That much?
- You…

70
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,600
This is an exorbitant price.

71
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,640
Do you have the money?

72
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,120
This is an astronomical price.

73
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,720
Sir,

74
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,040
doing business is all about reputation.

75
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,200
We have received the buyer's deposit.

76
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,200
- That's right.
- We can't just go back on our word.

77
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,040
How about this? Name a price.

78
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,160
I will make the decision to buy it.

79
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,040
Well…

80
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,800
Just name a price.

81
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,720
I like this smell.

82
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,160
Lady, look at this.
This one has a unique design.

83
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,480
This one looks even better.

84
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,320
OFFERING ALL KINDS OF TEA

85
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,880
It matches the color of your clothes.

86
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,800
- Here.
- Not bad.

87
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,160
- It smells good.
- Have a try.

88
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,680
You can try this.

89
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,760
It smells so good,
and the scent is quite special.

90
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,160
This one also smells very good.

91
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,160
Then, I'll take this one.

92
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,760
- I want this one.
- Alright.

93
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,360
Young lady, take a look

94
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,680
at this indigo-colored sachet.

95
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,520
- It suits you more.
- This scent is quite nice.

96
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,440
SIFU HOUSE

97
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,400
This one is good too.

98
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,200
SIFU HOUSE

99
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,640
Mother, why are you crying?

100
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,480
What's going on?

101
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,320
- Why are you crying now?
- Mother!

102
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,400
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

103
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,440
Mother, why are you crying?

104
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,720
What's wrong? What happened?

105
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,960
Just tell us.

106
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,520
Everything can be shared between us.

107
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,520
Mother, just tell us.

108
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,880
The dowry…

109
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,200
- What about the dowry?
- The dowry…

110
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,480
I think I know.

111
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,800
The shop brought in a famous zither
at a high price.

112
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,760
Mother has been waiting for days, but the
customer with the deposit hasn't shown.

113
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,280
Mother, could it be
that you have been scammed?

114
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,920
Yes, they were a bunch of scammers!

115
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,600
How much did you spend?

116
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,000
- One hundred…
- What?

117
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,800
It's just a zither.

118
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,880
It's worth ten to 20 strings at most.
You spent 100?

119
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,760
No one will be fooled like that.

120
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,600
It's 180 strings.

121
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,520
Hundred and eighty strings?

122
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,680
Mother, last time I asked you
for a hairpin,

123
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,400
you even thought 180 coins were too much,

124
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,320
and now, we are talking about 180 strings.

125
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,760
Mr. Liao said someone

126
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,560
would pay 300 strings for that zither.

127
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,960
And those scammers kept saying

128
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,120
that it was a treasure

129
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,840
and a cherished item
that's worth a big fortune.

130
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,600
As soon as I heard them,
I got dizzy and my vision blurred.

131
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,160
It's like my mouth wasn't even my own.

132
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,680
I just asked the price directly.

133
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,960
Most of the money from selling the land

134
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,280
has been spent on the shop.

135
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,560
Now I lost 180 strings.

136
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,160
That's the dowry for all of you.

137
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,320
Those scammers should be cursed.

138
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,400
It's like stabbing my heart

139
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,880
with a knife.

140
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,280
- Every time I think of it…
- Alright, alright.

141
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,160
…it's like another stab.

142
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,800
Mother, we are familiar
with perfumes and flowers.

143
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,800
But not antiques, paintings,
and calligraphy arts.

144
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,280
Last year, we set up a counter
for the trend,

145
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,760
and it attracted many regulars
who love the flea market.

146
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,000
Didn't we agree
not to buy in valuable items?

147
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,840
How could you change that so easily?

148
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,480
I bet those few are all in cahoots.

149
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,560
Where is Mr. Liao?

150
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,560
And the zither?

151
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,840
I gave Mr. Liao

152
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,240
a bout of scolding and drove him away.

153
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,720
Afterwards, I still felt angry.

154
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,640
I wanted to find an axe

155
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,160
and cut that zither into firewood,

156
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,120
but I couldn't find the axe.

157
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,040
So, I just threw the zither away
at some place.

158
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
You threw it away?

159
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,720
Chunlai, go over there and look.

160
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,400
Kangning,

161
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,880
maybe someone has already taken it.

162
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,560
Maybe we should stop looking and go back.

163
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,320
Mother said when she threw the zither,
the night market hadn't ended yet.

164
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,560
Maybe it's still here.

165
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,680
Mother saved up for a long time
to get those 180 strings.

166
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,280
How could we just give up like this?

167
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,320
This is strange.

168
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,760
Mother said she threw it here.
Where could it be?

169
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,400
Do you hear that?

170
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,680
Kangning, are we not looking anymore?

171
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,320
Chai,

172
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,360
don't think you can get away with this.

173
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,240
XIANGGUO TEMPLE

174
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,120
Come and take a look at the flowers.

175
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,520
They are here.

176
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,400
Do you think it will work?

177
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,000
Mother, I've heard that Madam Chai
always prays on fasting days.

178
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,080
Be it monks or Taoists, none are spared
her devotion. She is very pious.

179
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,320
Just do as I taught you.

180
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,560
It will work.

181
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,600
Alright.

182
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,400
- Then I'll go.
- Go.

183
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,680
Thank you for blessing us, Bodhisattva.

184
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,240
What's going on?

185
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,560
Thank you.

186
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,400
- Thank you, Bodhisattva.
- We have

187
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,680
- five girls waiting for marriage.
- Please, Bodhisattva.

188
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,920
- A few days ago…
- Thank you.

189
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,840
…she came

190
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,720
to worship the Bodhisattva and pray for
good marriages for her daughters.

191
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,080
Her prayers have been heard.

192
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,360
Now, we are here to thank the Bodhisattva.

193
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,360
Thank you, Bodhisattva.

194
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,080
Is it true they've all gotten married?

195
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,760
Is this a deception or what?

196
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,960
- I'd be a donkey to deceive you.
- Thank you.

197
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,800
Is it really so effective?

198
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,760
I don't know how many times I've kowtowed,

199
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,120
how many bridges I've repaired,
and how many roads I've paved.

200
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,680
My wishes have not been answered yet.

201
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,640
How could a commoner have such blessings?

202
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,480
- Go ask her again.
- Yes.

203
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,680
Thank you so much.

204
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,280
- Thank you for fulfilling my wishes.
- Madam, can you tell me more?

205
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,720
It's a magical encounter
that our lady had.

206
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
I don't know more.

207
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,600
Madam, please.

208
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,440
Alright.

209
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,040
Since you are so sincere,
I'll tell you, but only you.

210
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,160
Okay.

211
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,080
That day,

212
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,200
after we prayed to the Bodhisattva here,

213
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,600
we were guided by the Bodhisattva.

214
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,160
We met an old immortal.

215
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,720
- An old immortal?
- Yes.

216
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,360
Thank you for blessing us, Bodhisattva.

217
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,200
Thank you.

218
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,720
Thank you for fulfilling my wishes.

219
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
You have suffered, Mother.

220
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,640
Are you alright?

221
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,800
How is it? Will it work?

222
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,920
Let's wait and see.

223
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,360
And we got this.

224
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,480
Stop here.

225
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,920
Hurry. Stop here.

226
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,880
Make way at the front.
Why are you blocking the way?

227
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,920
Our lady'd like to ask you
some questions.

228
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,480
Is it the Third Lady Kangning
in the sedan chair?

229
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,640
Master Chai,

230
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,840
- have our families had any feuds?
- No.

231
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,920
- Have we made enemies recently?
- No, we haven't.

232
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,680
If that's the case,
why did you conspire with Mr. Liao

233
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,800
to deceive my mother?

234
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,080
Didn't you and your sisters

235
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,360
also deceive Fan Lianghan?

236
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,920
Master Fan and my second sister

237
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,160
are a married couple.

238
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,040
We are a family.

239
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,760
There is no such thing as deceiving,

240
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,880
but understandable humor.

241
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,800
Fan Lianghan is my cousin.

242
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,120
He is also my family.

243
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,960
It's only right and proper

244
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,680
that I seek justice for him.

245
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,800
Master Chai, are you determined

246
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,720
to give my family a hard time?

247
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,360
That's not true.
Although I am no gentleman,

248
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,400
I disdain to trouble women and children.
Deqing.

249
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,320
What are you doing in broad daylight?

250
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,040
Be careful, or we'll report you.

251
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,440
Third Lady, the antique business
is often fraught with deceit,

252
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,040
and your family is new here.

253
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,640
You'll inevitably attract jealous eyes.

254
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,680
I did this just to remind you.

255
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,720
Business is not easy in Bianjing.

256
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,440
You must be extremely careful from now on.

257
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,080
Do not be credulous or greedy for money.

258
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,040
You need to stay grounded
and avoid being rash and impulsive.

259
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,720
If someone employs tricks
on you again in the future,

260
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,200
presumably, you won't fall for them.

261
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,880
You still don't get it?

262
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,520
My master heard that someone
was going to target your family,

263
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,720
so he warned you in advance.

264
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,240
Now that you've learned your lesson,

265
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,200
you can have the money back.

266
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,080
Let's go.

267
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,400
Chunlai, give it to me.

268
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,440
That man is so strange.

269
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,280
Why are there 40 strings less?

270
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,320
My master said that the 30 strings
of interest money must be repaid,

271
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,360
and you have to pay the rent for our
shopkeeper, calligraphy, and paintings.

272
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
Villain!

273
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,040
We don't need you to give us the warning.

274
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,040
It was clearly deliberate mockery.

275
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,400
We didn't go to you,

276
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,880
yet you came to me.

277
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,520
Fine, then bask in your pleasure
a little longer.

278
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,080
Let's see if you can
stay this way afterwards.

279
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,440
Mother,

280
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,560
I'm back.

281
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,320
You are finally back.

282
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,960
You run around all day.

283
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,000
Even I have to send someone
to fetch you when I want to see you.

284
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,560
I got held up a few days ago.

285
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,920
Please forgive me, Mother.

286
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,720
Has anything good happened?
I haven't seen you this joyful in a while.

287
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,120
With you always striving for better,

288
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,520
I don't worry a bit about the businesses,

289
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,440
except for one thing.

290
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,040
- You know it.
- Mother.

291
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,040
Why are you bringing it up again?

292
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,400
I have my own plans

293
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,520
about my marriage.

294
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,000
What plans could you possibly have?

295
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,600
Stop putting me off

296
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,920
by making excuses.

297
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,920
It's been years.

298
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Even that good-for-nothing Fan Lianghan
got married before you.

299
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,040
How can I be at peace?

300
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,200
I know you're with high aspirations.

301
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,760
When your father was here, he wished you'd
marry a lady from a scholar's family.

302
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,120
Since you agreed,
you will keep your promise.

303
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,480
Rest assured. That wish will be fulfilled

304
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,880
at the latest by next year.

305
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,240
Why is that?

306
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,680
I met an old immortal
on my way out yesterday.

307
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,560
He travels to all places,

308
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,160
only to raise money
to repair a Taoist temple.

309
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,120
As long as I donate some money,
you'll be able to marry a wife next year.

310
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,560
Mother, immortals
are supposed to be in temples.

311
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,560
Since when do you see them
running in the streets?

312
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,560
Why have you started
believing in such street swindlers?

313
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,160
The streets are bustling

314
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,320
with ordinary mortals.

315
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,760
He couldn't be an immortal.

316
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,520
He was a true immortal.

317
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,320
Before I even spoke, he knew my wishes

318
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,480
and the situation of our family.

319
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,960
Every word he said was precise.

320
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,480
I don't care.

321
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,240
I promised to donate money

322
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,920
for the temple's building.

323
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,120
I've already made the donation.

324
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,040
Giving out wealth is a blessing.

325
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,240
If you wish to donate for inner peace,
then let it be.

326
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,960
Okay.

327
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,920
How much did you donate?

328
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,240
I wanted to donate more,

329
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,040
but he wouldn't take it.

330
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,840
I didn't donate much. Only 180 strings.

331
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,680
PAN RESTAURANT

332
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,120
Sir.

333
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,720
- That Third Lady sent a message.
- What is it?

334
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,000
She wants to thank you
for your generous donation.

335
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,640
It only took 100 coins
to thank the immortal.

336
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,120
The rest has been returned in full.

337
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,160
She wants you to remember

338
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,120
that however clever you are,
there is always someone more clever.

339
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,240
- You shouldn't…
- Shouldn't what?

340
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,600
You shouldn't act pompous and arrogant,
which makes you a person of narrow view.

341
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,840
Move closer.

342
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,240
SIFU HOUSE

343
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,400
My lady,

344
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,600
they've returned the money to us,

345
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,560
saying it's just a tad of money,
and it's not significant.

346
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,760
They even said that if you fancy it,

347
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,640
you can buy yourself some flowers with it.

348
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,520
That's cheeky.

349
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,720
They can't admit defeat,

350
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,720
but mock us instead.

351
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,360
This is sarcasm
about my family being poor.

352
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,440
We can't take a coin
of the ill-gotten wealth.

353
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,160
Otherwise, for what you take today,

354
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,440
they'll take a hundredfold back

355
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,840
from you later.

356
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,480
Come here.

357
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,080
- Come.
- Young lady!

358
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,640
- Young lady!
- Thank you, young lady!

359
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,920
- There's enough for both.
- Okay.

360
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,520
- Don't fight over the money.
- Thank you!

361
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,200
You have the heart of a Bodhisattva.

362
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
Thank you, young lady!

363
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,560
Thank you, young lady!

364
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,080
Alright.

365
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,360
They are giving away our money, my master.

366
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,320
Let's go. Hurry.

367
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,440
Let's go buy something tasty.

368
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,280
Young master!

369
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,000
What? You could deceive her,

370
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,200
but she couldn't deceive you?

371
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,360
Anyway, I gave her the money.

372
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,760
Besides, Mother wants that money

373
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,080
to be used for good deeds.

374
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,120
Weren't they just doing good deeds?

375
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,760
So, that's it? You will do nothing?

376
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,040
As a lady of the inner chamber,

377
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,400
she knows not to touch unrighteous wealth.

378
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,840
It makes me admire her a bit more.

379
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,400
However,

380
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,880
acting so rashly and impetuously will lead

381
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,040
to great losses for her in the future.

382
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Master Chai.

383
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,200
Master Chai.

384
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,200
I went to Dongji'er Lane to see Lu Yanyan.

385
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,720
I begged and pleaded,

386
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,440
offering all sorts of jewelry,

387
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,600
brocades, and fine gauze.

388
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,320
Finally, she agreed
to attend the banquet at Pan.

389
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,320
You need to buy me
half a year's worth of liquor.

390
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,600
Young master, Master Yang came again.

391
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,520
He cursed away three, four companions
and drank two jars of wine quietly.

392
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,880
I wonder if he will cause trouble.

393
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,080
YANG XIAN

394
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,640
Leave him be.

395
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,480
Master Chai.

396
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,120
Master Chai.

397
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,200
Master Chai,
when the Mid-Autumn comes…

398
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,760
Please hear me out.

399
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,440
I see. I have things to do today.
Let's talk another day.

400
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,360
Master Chai.

401
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,360
Master Chai.

402
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,960
What's going on?

403
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,560
It's purely bad timing.

404
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,920
My master is in a bad mood.

405
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
He can't get the bellyful of anger
out of his chest.

406
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,560
- What happened?
- My master is magnanimous.

407
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,200
He doesn't stoop to fight with a woman.

408
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,760
Forget about it.
You didn't hear me saying anything.

409
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,200
Tell me about it. You never know.

410
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,200
I may be able to help him
get this sullenness out.

411
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,240
It's her again.

412
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,920
I still have that slap

413
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,960
on my account.

414
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,120
The beef wasn't settled yet.

415
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,440
Exactly.

416
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,800
Even if you search all Bianjing,

417
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,920
you won't find a second one
as shrewish as she is.

418
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,120
I don't think that's true.

419
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,240
There are six tigresses in the Li family.
A profound family heritage.

420
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,720
What on earth are you singing?

421
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
There is no strength in your singing.
Get lost.

422
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,160
No hurry. I'll go take a look.

423
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,000
Deqing. Deqing.

424
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,800
Yes, sir?

425
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,400
Give the order.

426
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,880
I want the new wine gathering

427
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,120
before Mid-Autumn to be grand and lively.

428
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,920
I'd like all of Bianjing to come and see,

429
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,920
so we can take down the arrogance
of Sifu House.

430
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,960
Okay.

431
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,880
SIFU HOUSE

432
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,280
MID-AUTUMN DAY
THE 15TH DAY OF THE EIGHTH LUNAR MONTH

433
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,000
They are washed quite thoroughly.

434
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,000
Our business is starting
to look promising.

435
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,280
We must be more attentive
during the Mid-Autumn Festival.

436
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,040
Be careful.

437
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,040
Be a bit more careful.

438
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,520
Everyone, be quick about it.

439
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,760
- Here.
- We know, Mother.

440
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,600
Come on. Be quicker about it.

441
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,040
- Careful.
- There won't be mistakes.

442
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,200
- Alright.
- Just rest assured.

443
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,600
Chunlai,

444
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,960
put these in place neatly.

445
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,400
This area needs to be sorted out.

446
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,720
Okay.

447
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,000
Jiang.

448
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,760
You need to trim the tree and the flower.

449
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,720
- Trim them to make them look nicer.
- Okay.

450
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,440
This area is done.

451
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,800
This needs to be taken care of.

452
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,680
You can't take down this painting.

453
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,600
Many people come for this genuine piece.

454
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,680
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

455
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,600
Scholars will be inspired to write poetry
after drinking some wine.

456
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,240
We can offer some cheap brushes and ink,

457
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,000
so that they can

458
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,880
write a poem or compose a verse
on this blank wall.

459
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,760
During next year's Spring Examination,
if someone becomes the Number One Scholar,

460
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,640
this will become
the Number One Scholar's Wall.

461
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,600
To write a poem on it,
you must be a famous or talented scholar.

462
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,920
That's a good idea.

463
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,560
They're full of boasting on ordinary days.

464
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,760
Now I'd like to see
which of them has genuine talent.

465
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,160
I will take them as my son-in-law.

466
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,840
Dear daughter, you are so intelligent.

467
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,360
I'll listen to you.

468
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,280
What are you doing?

469
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,760
I'll keep this painting for you.

470
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,480
Mother, we need to return this painting.

471
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,640
Well, he openly steals my business.
So what if I keep his painting?

472
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,320
Mother, we can't keep this painting.

473
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,240
Mother.

474
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,520
PAN RESTAURANT

475
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,760
PAN RESTAURANT

476
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,320
It's a rare sight.

477
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,320
We did the right thing coming here.

478
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,320
Exactly.

479
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,480
It's a feast for the eyes.

480
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,680
That's right.

481
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,000
It is so different.

482
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,800
It's thanks to Master Chai

483
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,200
- for coming up with the idea.
- Yes.

484
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,080
We've waited for this for a long time.

485
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,920
Raise the signboard.

486
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,440
Nice move.

487
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,920
Truly impressive.

488
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,800
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

489
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,960
THE BEST IN BIANJING

490
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,800
Great move.

491
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,120
Good skills. Such talent.

492
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,560
I wonder whether the wine is good.

493
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,760
Right. How's the wine?

494
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,400
Ladies and gentlemen, the host

495
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,440
doesn't boast about
whether the wine is good.

496
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,040
You can taste and find out yourselves.

497
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,280
This year, as the new owner
of Pan Restaurant,

498
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,480
not only do I invite you
to taste the wine,

499
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,160
but I also invite everyone in Bianjing

500
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,640
to come and try the Jade Wine
to see whether it's good or not.

501
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,800
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

502
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,680
Please welcome the best courtesan.

503
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,320
- Bravo.
- It's the best courtesan.

504
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,440
She is here.

505
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,040
Lu Yanyan!

506
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,520
- Lu Yanyan!
- The best courtesan.

507
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,800
- Lu Yanyan!
- Lu Yanyan!

508
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,480
- Lu Yanyan!
- Lu Yanyan!

509
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,280
She's looking at me.

510
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,600
- She's looking at me.
- Lu Yanyan!

511
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,440
- She is so beautiful.
- Lu Yanyan!

512
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,720
Come on. Let's go.

513
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,000
Let's go.

514
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,320
Over here.

515
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,800
Pan Restaurant is launching
its new wine today.

516
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,720
Come on.

517
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,880
Come to Pan Restaurant
and try the new wine.

518
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,480
This method isn't bad.

519
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,680
- The smell of the wine disperses fast.
- Pan's new wine!

520
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,920
Pan Restaurant is launching a new wine.

521
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,520
- Come and taste. Try it.
- Come on.

522
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,880
- Pan Restaurant is launching a new wine.
- Here. Try it.

523
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,480
Here. Try it.

524
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,240
- Pan is launching a new wine.
- Pan is launching a new wine today.

525
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,720
Everyone, come and show support.

526
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,960
Pan Restaurant
is launching a new wine today.

527
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,800
Everyone, come and have a try.

528
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,920
- Look.
- Try some.

529
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,040
Here. Try some.

530
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,120
- Try it.
- Okay.

531
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,720
- Here, try it.
- Thank you.

532
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,360
Everyone, come and try it.

533
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,480
You're welcomed to come and try!

534
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,200
Pan Restaurant is launching a new wine.

535
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,800
Come and try it.

536
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,800
Master Wang, you are here.

537
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,360
- Got a pot of Jade Wine for you.
- Good.

538
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,600
Been expecting you. Come.

539
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,440
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

540
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,840
Welcome.

541
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,480
- It's so grand.
- Let's go out and see.

542
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,440
No wonder they are so extravagant.

543
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,440
Sir, you always have good ideas.

544
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,680
With the parade going around the city,
all hear the news.

545
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,080
Please come in.

546
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,040
Deqing.

547
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,440
Take down the wine sign in the afternoon.

548
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,360
Tell the guests
today's Jade Wine is sold out

549
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,760
and they can come early tomorrow.

550
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,680
Okay.

551
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,480
Mother, stop watching.
Let's go back to business.

552
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,960
There is no business at all.

553
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,920
We got up before dawn
and have been busy until now,

554
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,560
all for today's business.

555
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,640
All the people on this street

556
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,160
have been lured away by him.

557
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,480
There is no business at all.

558
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,400
Liang was right.

559
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,880
She somewhat resembles the portrait.

560
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,080
It's just she's too far away.
I can't see her clearly either.

561
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,240
Haode and Leshan
have gone out to play again.

562
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,600
Kangning,

563
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,040
you stay for the business.

564
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,480
I'll go look for those two.

565
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,040
Chunlai, go with her.

566
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,960
Please.

567
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,280
Congratulations.

568
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,880
- Please.
- Congratulations.

569
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,280
Please come in.

570
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,720
Young master,
Master Liu from Daming Prefecture

571
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,200
ordered 200 jars of Jade Wine.

572
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,840
He is the most anxious to get it.
I feel we can't reason with him.

573
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,560
- I'll go take a look.
- Okay.

574
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,040
Deqing.

575
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,480
My mother will come too.
Wait at the door.

576
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,800
Then lead her to the pavilion,
to avoid the crowds.

577
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,760
Understood. Rest assured, sir.

578
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,160
- Please come inside.
- This way.

579
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,080
Good idea. You are the most ingenious one.

580
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,240
- Hurry and ask the cook to prepare.
- Okay.

581
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,320
Our shop has a new shuanglu game.

582
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,680
No, thank you.

583
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,840
- Master Wang, a game of shuanglu?
- Let's go drink up front.

584
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,040
It's harmful to your health
if you drink too much wine.

585
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,320
- Been a long time. Why--
- No. I'm going to Pan Restaurant.

586
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,480
Come here. We have shuanglu.

587
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,640
- I'll go to Pan Restaurant too.
- There's nothing there.

588
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,440
We have set up a shuanglu game
at our place.

589
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,960
We have a new shuanglu game at our place.

590
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,160
- Come, join us at Sifu--
- I'm heading to Pan Restaurant.

591
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,040
What's so good about it?

592
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,440
It was her. She swindled my money.

593
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,760
This is bad.

594
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,280
Take her to the officials.

595
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,280
What are you doing?

596
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,160
What's going on? What are you doing?

597
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,960
- What are you doing?
- What?

598
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,520
Fellow citizens, come and take a look.

599
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,160
Relying on her money,

600
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,160
someone here is bullying us

601
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,880
because we are not locals

602
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,280
who have no backing or support.

603
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,560
What's going on?

604
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,080
In broad daylight, how can you bully her?

605
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,520
Yes, indeed.
Listen to me. Let's not get physical.

606
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,280
Let me reason with you.

607
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,200
It's not too late to get physical
if words fail.

608
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,480
Exactly.

609
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,880
You shameless vulgar woman
and lying swindler!

610
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,920
Shut her mouth!

611
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,640
W-Who's the swindler?

612
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,280
Go shut her mouth quickly.

613
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,960
- You say I'm a swindler?
- What's going on?

614
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,800
I'm not a swindler.

615
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,800
You say I'm a swindler?

616
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,520
I'm not a swindler.

617
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,160
- Quick, stop her.
- I'm not a swindler.

618
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,960
Who are you calling a swindler?

619
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,440
You say I'm a swindler?

620
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,080
Who's a swindler, huh?

621
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,560
Say it.

622
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,760
Who's a swindler, huh?

623
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,880
Who are you calling a swindler?

624
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,320
Who are you calling a swindler?

625
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,600
- You say I'm a swindler?
- Mother!

626
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,560
- Mother!
- Mother!

627
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,000
- What's the matter?
- It's alright.

628
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,760
- Let's go home.
- Go away.

629
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,760
Listen to me.

630
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,000
I am naturally fierce.

631
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,320
Even if ten of your men come at me,

632
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,760
when I'm provoked,

633
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,960
I will make you

634
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,600
turn into clawless crabs one by one.

635
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,320
- Who is the swindler, huh?
- Move aside.

636
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,480
- Who is the swindler?
- Enough, Mother.

637
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,280
What are you doing? Let's go back.

638
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,840
- Mother!
- Stop fighting.

639
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,560
Mother! Mother!

640
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,240
Mother, stop fighting.

641
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,840
Calm down, Mother.

642
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,600
My apologies. Don't take offense.

643
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,720
Stop fighting.

644
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,040
- Mother, let's go back.
- Calm down.

645
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,600
Third Lady, quickly take your mother.

646
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,320
Mind your own business.

647
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,920
- Enough, Mother.
- Let's go.

648
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,440
Let's go back to the pavilion first.

649
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,280
- This isn't over!
- Let's go back to the pavilion first.

650
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,280
Mother, our own business
is more important.

651
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,200
She is right.

652
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,520
Let's go.

653
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,440
- Disperse.
- Let's go.

654
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,600
- Let's go.
- Disperse now.

655
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,640
Stop looking.

656
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,560
You gave me a fright.

657
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,440
Let's go.

658
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,480
Let's go.

659
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,600
There's a new trick again.

660
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,680
Come on.

661
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,640
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

662
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,320
Baifan Restaurant, Taiping Restaurant,

663
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,040
and Chunfeng Restaurant all sell new wine.

664
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,960
As the saying goes,

665
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,440
"One cup of wine and the fierce tiger
lie in the mountains,

666
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,720
and two cups and the dragon sleeps
in the sea depths."

667
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,120
If you have three cups,

668
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,480
I assure you your guts

669
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:59,000
will be turning upside down.

670
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,760
To those passing by,

671
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,320
have a bowl of our shop's hangover soup.

672
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:09,640
I guarantee you'll get less scolding
when you get home.

673
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,680
The dark plum and osmanthus hangover soup

674
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,080
quenches thirst and refreshes you
with a fragrant aroma.

675
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,680
It costs only three coins per bowl.

676
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,760
It's very cheap.

677
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,160
It smells good. I'll have a bowl.

678
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,200
- I'll have one too.
- Please, come this way.

679
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,760
Three coins per bowl.

680
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,240
- It's very cheap.
- Only three coins per bowl.

681
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,640
Madam Li,

682
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,920
you've hidden away
such a beautiful daughter.

683
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,440
Willing to let her serve drinks,

684
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,600
you must be earning a vast fortune.

685
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,960
Exactly.

686
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,320
If you keep spewing nonsense,

687
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,080
I'll gouge out those toad eyes of yours
and put them in the hangover soup

688
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,080
to boil them together.

689
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,400
- I was kidding.
- My third daughter.

690
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,880
Hangover soup! Hangover soup!

691
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,200
The incredibly aromatic hangover soup!

692
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,960
Osmanthus hangover soup!

693
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,960
There is enough for everyone. Be patient.

694
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,040
It looked so bad
in the middle of the street.

695
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,080
Mother.

696
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,040
Mother, come on.

697
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,600
Sit here.

698
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,320
Well, well.

699
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,080
How dare you do business trampling us?

700
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,400
Send some people quickly

701
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,760
to take down that vulgar woman.

702
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,640
Mother, it's not a big deal.

703
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,880
Doing that will make us all look bad.
Just let it go.

704
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,040
I've lived for most of my life

705
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,520
as a decent and respectful person.

706
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,760
Today, because
of that ignorant, vulgar woman,

707
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,400
I've lost all my dignity.

708
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,960
If you take yourself as my son,

709
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,200
quickly send out people

710
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,360
- to smash her shop…
- Mother.

711
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,200
…and immediately take her to the officials

712
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,240
to vent my anger.

713
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,080
Have you forgotten?
It's Mid-Autumn Festival.

714
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,040
The officials are celebrating
the festival. Sit.

715
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,640
There's no reason in involving

716
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,280
the officials over this trifle, right?

717
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,640
Madam Li has been a widow for many years,
raising several daughters by herself.

718
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,200
It's said she was bullied by relatives
in the countryside of Luoyang.

719
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,840
That's why she had to sell her land

720
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,720
and come to Bianjing.

721
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,280
If you truly take issue with her,

722
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,640
it'd seem as if our family
is bullying them with our power.

723
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,760
Besides, the Li family
is Lianghan's in-laws.

724
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,640
You should consider him and his family.

725
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,960
If you had them arrested,

726
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,960
how would Aunt Fan feel about it?

727
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,280
- But she…
- Mother.

728
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,120
Upon seeing her, I can't help

729
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,520
but remember the years
when my father just passed away

730
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,920
and how you endured hardships

731
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,920
to raise me
and manage the family's affairs.

732
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,680
So, I always feel
a bit of compassion for her.

733
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,200
She is someone with a crude manner,

734
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,160
while you're a well-educated
and mannered person known far and wide.

735
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,360
Considering the hardships
of a widow and her daughters,

736
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,800
please do not take issues with her.

737
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,040
Alright?

738
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,680
All right, Mother.

739
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,720
- She has daughters waiting to be married.
- Right.

740
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,720
And she doesn't accumulate virtue
for their sake.

741
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,560
She was that rude, fierce, and indecent.

742
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,480
Within two days,
the whole of Bianjing will know.

743
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,240
- Yes, you are right.
- If it were me,

744
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,440
I would rather die without an heir
than to ever seek such a daughter-in-law.

745
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,720
You're right. Calm down, Mother.

746
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,160
Take my mother home.

747
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,040
- I'll go back when I'm done here.
- Yes.

748
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,680
Just calm down.

749
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,280
Don't be angry anymore, Mother.

750
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,400
Don't be angry anymore.

751
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,960
Stop there.

752
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,360
Under the Emperor's feet,
in a clear and civilized age,

753
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,760
who are you scoundrels
dare to tease a respectable lady?

754
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,080
The Emperor?

755
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,920
Coincidentally,
the one sitting on the throne

756
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
happens to be my brother-in-law,
if it comes to that.

757
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,320
You tell me,
what kind of "scoundrel" am I?

758
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,160
Don't bother with him. Let's go.

759
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,120
- You…
- Don't be afraid, young lady.

760
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,960
Women are not to my liking.

761
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,200
Even the most beautiful woman

762
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,000
is just a piece of wood in my eyes.

763
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:54,040
I made a bet that within ten days,
I must find the person in this painting.

764
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,200
Otherwise, I would lose a manor to him.

765
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,240
Young lady,
let me take a good look at you.

766
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,040
I won't give you any trouble.
I'll give you ten taels of gold instead.

767
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,480
- Come, don't move.
- What are you doing? Let go.

768
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,720
- He has money on him.
- Young lady!

769
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,400
- What are you doing?
- Don't touch me.

770
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,600
Let go of your dirty hands.

771
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,840
- Young master!
- Get off!

772
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,480
- What are you doing?
- Are you all blind?

773
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,120
Do you know who I am?

774
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,800
- Don't touch me.
- Let go!

775
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,320
- Careful, sir.
- This is fine material.

776
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,680
I want that jade pendant!

777
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,200
- My belt!
- It's mine now.

778
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,120
- It's mine now.
- My belt.

779
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,360
Stop.

780
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,640
- Be careful, young master.
- You've torn my clothes.

781
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,880
Sis, let's go.

782
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,320
All of you, back off. Go after her.

783
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,600
- Don't touch me. Hands off.
- Take the clothes.

784
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,960
- Young master!
- Don't touch me.

785
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,240
Let's go. Quickly.

786
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,040
Young master, are you alright?

787
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,120
Sir?

788
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,200
What are you laughing at? Stop looking.

789
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,280
Go away.

790
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,720
You with the veil, stop right there.

791
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,720
Pah!

792
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,480
Stop looking.

793
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,160
What are you looking at?
Give me your clothes.

794
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,360
Stop looking.

795
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,520
- Hurry up.
- Sir.

796
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,000
All of you, go away.

797
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,640
Stop laughing, all of you.

798
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,000
What are you still waiting for?
Go after her quickly.

799
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,240
Hurry up.

800
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,400
I have always been the one
bullying others.

801
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,640
Li family, I'll remember you.

802
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,920
- Slow down.
- It's truly beautiful tonight.

803
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,640
- I want to sit on this side.
- Then I'll sit here.

804
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,840
I'll do the cutting today.

805
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,120
- I'll cut it.
- Last time, you did the cutting.

806
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,880
Don't fight over it
with your elder sister.

807
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,000
I'll cut it.

808
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,680
Then you do it.

809
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,760
What part do you want?

810
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,320
- I want to eat the filling inside.
- Then who will eat the crust?

811
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,200
- You eat it.
- I don't want the crust.

812
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,200
- I want the filling.
- Cut it quickly.

813
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,280
This is too hard.
I can't cut it. You do it.

814
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,400
It has to be me in the end.

815
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,040
Leshan, what's that new style
on your head?

816
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,040
I've heard that inside the palace,

817
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,040
Consort Shang and Consort Yang
are the most favored.

818
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,160
They compete with each other
both openly and secretly.

819
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,280
Consort Shang loves
pearl decorations in her makeup.

820
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,640
It has been very popular
in the city recently.

821
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,000
How is it? Doesn't it look good?

822
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,560
Tell me. Where did you find
such fine pearls?

823
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,560
Mother, you've been
subsidizing her secretly again.

824
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,640
I want pearls too.

825
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,960
I'll pluck some off you.

826
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,120
You… Open your mouth.

827
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,680
Where are the pearls?

828
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,040
You're the worst.

829
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,720
Mother.

830
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,520
Fuhui.

831
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,640
Didn't you say you'd spend the Festival
with the Fan's and come back tomorrow?

832
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,080
Second sister.

833
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,160
Our beloved little five

834
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,040
has offended that lawless Master Yang.

835
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,520
Even your brother-in-law can't save you.
Get up quickly. Go packing upstairs.

836
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,240
I'll send you away to stay out of trouble.

837
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,880
Big sis, you have to go as well.

838
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,000
Bianjing is really different.

839
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,080
Anyone you bump into outside
is either rich or noble.

840
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,440
So, Master Yang
comes from a distinguished family.

841
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,120
So what if he is an official?

842
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,000
If he dares to come at our door,

843
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,200
I'll chase him away with a door bolt.

844
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,200
Mother.

845
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,040
He's far more fearsome than any official.

846
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,440
His elder sister

847
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,680
is Consort Yang,
who is most favored by His Majesty.

848
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,760
In the palace, she is even
more prestigious than the Empress.

849
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,000
His Majesty appointed their grandfather
as the governor of Guizhou just now

850
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,480
and will grant Master Young a position.
If he were hurt in any way,

851
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,960
Consort Yang will be furious.

852
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,440
They'll hold our family accountable.

853
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,360
Mother, for our sisters' sake,

854
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,520
promise me that you won't act rashly.

855
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,920
Is it really that serious?

856
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,320
Now is not the time to ask.

857
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,360
Leshan, I will help you pack.
Just leave to avoid the trouble.

858
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,680
If he intends to seek revenge,

859
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,360
I'm afraid it's too late to leave now.

860
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,080
Fuhui, did you look around
before you entered?

861
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,600
Thirty.

862
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,840
Forty.

863
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,320
Indeed, some are missing.

864
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,800
Master Yang,

865
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,560
you insisted
that you lost your pouch in our shop,

866
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,080
but the pouch is right here.

867
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,080
And no one
has touched a single pearl in it.

868
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,280
Make sure you count them well.

869
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,320
Originally, there were
a hundred large pearls in this pouch.

870
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,880
Now, half of them are gone.

871
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,640
If they weren't taken by your shop,
could they have just flown away?

872
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,440
You need evidence to back your words.

873
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,200
Evidence?

874
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,920
My words are the evidence.

875
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,960
You…

876
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,840
Right in front of everyone's eyes,

877
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,560
you took half a bag of my pearls.

878
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,800
Your Sifu House is clearly a shady shop.

879
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,880
Let's take it up with the authorities.

880
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,040
But I accept negotiation.

881
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,560
Bring me the young lady
who robbed me that day.

882
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,200
Have her kowtow to me.
Maybe I'll be pleased

883
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,800
and let you off the hook.

884
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,400
Otherwise, we'll see you in court.

885
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,720
Once this lawsuit begins,

886
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,840
it could last three to six months.

887
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,520
You'll be locked up, and the shop
will be sealed for investigation.

888
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,800
You all better think it through.

889
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,200
Which one of us are you looking for, sir?

890
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,560
Third Lady, don't go.

891
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,480
Who let you out? Hurry and go back.

892
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,720
Not you. Call out the one
from the bridge that day.

893
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,160
What? Not me that you are looking for?

894
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,480
Then it is my mistake.

895
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,760
Or perhaps you have the wrong address?

896
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,640
It's this canopy hat.
It was you. There is no mistake.

897
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,680
What exactly do you want?

898
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,040
Your daughter disrobed me in public
and tarnished my reputation.

899
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,000
She can either join my house
or apologize with her death.

900
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,360
But it's a life after all.
I've decided to take her as my concubine.

901
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,680
- These are the betrothal gifts.
- You…

902
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,640
Mother.

903
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,880
Have you forgotten what Fuhui said?

904
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,400
I will take it as a "yes" from you.
A verbal agreement is no guarantee.

905
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,720
Let's take this skirt as proof.

906
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,440
Three days later,
I'll deliver the betrothal gifts on time.

907
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,040
Young lady, you must wait for me.

908
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,760
Let's go.

909
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,240
What…

910
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,520
Where is Leshan?

911
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,600
I've locked her up.

912
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,200
Sis, if you do this for me,

913
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,160
I will never sleep tight ever again.

914
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,920
I don't want you to worry.

915
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:15,920
I'll go talk to him.

916
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,120
If you go to him,
I'm afraid there'll be bloodshed.

917
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,600
If you step out of this door,
you're abandoning your mother

918
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,520
and sisters.

919
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,800
You promised to hold your temper.

920
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,160
Are you trying to make me mad?

921
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,720
I'll go to the government and accuse him
of forcing a civilian to become concubine.

922
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,080
Now that the Yang family
is at the height of its power,

923
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,120
who would dare to take this lawsuit?

924
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,160
Even if someone takes it,

925
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,520
it will be delayed and hidden.

926
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,640
How could we be saved
from this imminent danger?

927
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,040
That heartless Yang Xian
took away your skirt.

928
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,080
If it's brought before the court,
your innocence might as well be discarded.

929
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,080
Third Lady, what should we do?

930
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,960
Let alone a pouch of pearls,

931
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,920
even if it were a mountain of gold,

932
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,440
we couldn't agree
to that kind of scoundrel's request.

933
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,560
PAN RESTAURANT

934
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,960
I have told you
all the details of the matter.

935
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,360
Please do everything you can

936
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,560
to dispel Yang Xian's
malicious intentions.

937
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,760
Thank you, cousin.

938
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,320
You want me to help her?

939
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,640
Will the Third Lady appreciate it?

940
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,800
My mother had a dispute with Madam Li.

941
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,120
I'm afraid she might think

942
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,960
I go only to mock her.
She might kick me out.

943
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,080
Unless she asks me for help personally,

944
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,200
then I will do my utmost to help her.

945
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,640
- If you wish to meet her--
- No, I just can't stand injustices

946
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,440
and want to help her out.

947
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,080
Previously,
she was arrogant and disrespectful.

948
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,720
Now that she's in trouble,
she has to seek help from you.

949
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,040
If you ask me, you should not
get involved in this matter.

950
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,360
- Let them cry out.
- Be quiet.

951
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,680
She's my cousin's in-law,
so she's also related to me.

952
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,800
If I didn't help her in a crucial moment,
what kind of person would I be then?

953
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,720
When meeting him later,

954
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,960
be patient

955
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,760
and say a few good words.

956
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,400
You must not be willful anymore
and bring trouble upon me.

957
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,640
- Do you hear me?
- Of course.

958
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,440
