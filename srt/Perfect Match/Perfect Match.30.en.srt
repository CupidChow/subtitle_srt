00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,440
EPISODE 30

2
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,960
The new son-in-law visits his in-laws.

3
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,400
As tradition,
he must serve tea to the elders.

4
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,440
Please.

5
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,960
<i>Easy tests. I've got it.</i>

6
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,160
Madam, please.

7
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,160
Mom.

8
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,320
He's seven or eight days late.

9
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,360
The Yang family
must've brought lavish gifts.

10
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
Why don't we take a look first?

11
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
Okay.

12
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,880
Qiansheng.

13
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,560
Sure.

14
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,160
Quite thoughtful.

15
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,000
Take them.

16
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,920
Mom.

17
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,360
Have some tea.

18
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,680
Get up.

19
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,440
Mom.

20
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,360
I was naive and arrogant in my youth.

21
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,680
I was misled by others,

22
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,360
which led to foolish mistakes.

23
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,680
Thanks to your forgiveness,
I married Leshan.

24
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,680
Since our marriage,

25
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,960
my wife has guided me tirelessly.

26
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,080
I've reflected on my past mistakes.

27
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,840
I vow to turn over a new leaf
and leave my faults behind.

28
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,280
I hope everyone here

29
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,600
can forgive me. I'm truly grateful.

30
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,440
It's not late, not late at all!

31
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,600
It's good that you've changed.

32
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,160
Who hasn't made mistakes in their youth?

33
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,360
But what if they disagree?

34
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,320
You're from a rich family,

35
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,120
- and you're young
- Mom.

36
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,600
- and easily misled by other evils.
- Sit down.

37
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,280
- But he regrets his mistakes now.
- I really miss you.

38
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,400
That's good.

39
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,200
We're family. There's no room for grudges.

40
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,280
Right, my lord?

41
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,120
My wife is right. Absolutely.

42
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,280
He…

43
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,040
Thank you, Madam.

44
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,920
<i>Something feels off to me.</i>

45
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,240
<i>You better sort this out.</i>

46
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,160
What's that burnt smell?

47
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,000
I've got pork simmering on the stove.

48
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,800
Yang Xian, I am cooking today. Try it.

49
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,480
- You all sit with him.
- Thanks, Madam.

50
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,280
We'll join you.

51
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's go too.

52
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,920
- And me.
- The soup.

53
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,520
Kangning makes it the best.

54
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,360
It's rare to have such a guest.

55
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,480
We need your help.

56
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,960
- Let's go.
- Kangning, just go.

57
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,640
Yang Xian, excuse us for a moment.

58
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,280
Of course.

59
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,960
Wait…

60
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,280
Good luck.

61
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,280
- Yuanming.
- Chai.

62
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,040
Leshan, tell me the truth.

63
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,440
Are you conspiring with him to fool Mom?

64
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,640
Change?

65
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,840
He'll never change.

66
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,520
Not even if pigs climb trees.

67
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,480
That's nonsense.

68
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,240
Fuhui tamed her husband.

69
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,640
Why can't I do the same?

70
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,440
Kangning,

71
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,120
you underestimate me.

72
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,880
What are they up to?

73
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,280
You're new here,
so you don't know our family rules.

74
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,400
It's not hard to marry into the Li family.

75
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,920
First, remember three things.

76
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,240
The first, when your wife is upset…

77
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,000
You must soothe her.

78
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,960
- What about scolding from Madam?
- Endure it.

79
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,880
My wife reminded me many times.
I won't forget.

80
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,720
Did she tell you
before joining the Li Family,

81
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,160
you should first pass the tests
from us, the brothers-in-law?

82
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,560
What kind of tests?

83
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,960
Yuanming.

84
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,840
Back when we chose a husband for her,

85
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,960
we followed our wives' orders.

86
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,920
We searched the entire capital
for the best talents.

87
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
No one dared approach Li's house

88
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,160
without exceptional skills.

89
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,040
Today, I see you handsome and charming.

90
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,800
His look matches with Leshan.

91
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,000
But to know how he matches her
on the talents,

92
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,960
it will depend on your learnings.

93
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,800
- Lord Shen.
- Don't look at me.

94
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,680
Outside, I have some authority,

95
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,800
but in this house,

96
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,160
my wife is the fourth sister.

97
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,640
She's one of the younger ones.

98
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,680
Even if I'd like to help you,

99
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,040
I don't have a say here.

100
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,680
Master Yang,

101
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,280
you can only rely on yourself.

102
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,440
Stop it!

103
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,640
Take a break. Don't move.

104
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,080
What kind of test?

105
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,240
Yuanming.

106
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,720
A martial challenge?

107
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,760
We know you're not skilled.

108
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,440
- So, let's test academics.
- Yeah.

109
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,600
Instruments, chess, calligraphy,
and painting. Pick one.

110
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,000
Show us what you're good at.

111
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,760
Master Yang,

112
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,360
if it's decent,

113
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,520
we'll accept you.

114
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,400
Old grudges will be forgotten.

115
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,320
But if you fail,

116
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,840
don't blame us for being harsh.

117
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,200
Give him a tough lesson,

118
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,320
so he knows the Li family isn't easy.

119
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,120
Being a Li son-in-law is even harder.

120
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,760
- I should check on them.
- Where to?

121
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,880
Stay out of it. It's men's business.

122
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,080
<i>Oh no!</i>

123
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,360
<i>I forgot how tricky</i>
<i>my brothers-in-law are.</i>

124
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,400
I studied painting in my youth.

125
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,120
Though not as skilled as Mr. Du,

126
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,880
my strokes are decent.

127
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,480
Do it.

128
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,120
Excuse me.

129
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,080
Too much ink bleeds the lines.
Haven't you learned this?

130
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,040
It's said, strength gives grace.

131
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,440
Speed gives stiffness.

132
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,400
Reflect on yourself.

133
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,600
Don't defend your flaws.

134
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,320
Tension creates vigor.

135
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,920
Act recklessly
and there will be consequences.

136
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,680
Straighten your back.

137
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,720
The ink needs some water.

138
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,040
Stay humble and self-aware.

139
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,320
Aim high but avoid arrogance.

140
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,080
Be grounded but ambitious.

141
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,200
Face life with a calm smile.

142
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,160
There.

143
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,880
All done.

144
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,040
After all that, your mouth must be dry.

145
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,000
You outnumbered and bullied me.

146
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,520
How shameful!

147
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,560
Who can respect that?

148
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,800
Cousin, he is not convinced
and speaks of bullying.

149
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,520
You oppressed others and forced marriage.

150
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,880
Are you not shameful?

151
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,840
If you say no,

152
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,520
we will beat you until you agree.

153
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,520
Count me in.

154
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,320
- What are you doing?
- This…

155
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,920
I told you not to act so rough.

156
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,200
- It's disgraceful.
- Shameless.

157
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,160
- This is too much!
- Enough, enough.

158
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,920
Just a friendly spar.

159
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,200
Stop!

160
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,680
- Come back!
- Leshan.

161
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,400
Stop!

162
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,520
Dinner's ready.

163
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,400
Mom. What?

164
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,560
- Nothing.
- Nothing at all.

165
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,640
Nothing.

166
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,600
- Mom.
- Mom.

167
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,640
Yang Xian wants duck.

168
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,920
He's too shy to ask.

169
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I just finished the duck soup. Let me--

170
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,520
I heard the two cooks
were borrowed from Pan Restaurant.

171
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,360
Let's check if everything's set.

172
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,240
- It's all ready.
- Mom.

173
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,600
Wine-flavored snails?

174
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,760
Didn't you just prepare some?

175
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,480
You want that?

176
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,840
Sure, I'll make them for you.

177
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,760
Dear brothers-in-law,
stop fighting already.

178
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,080
Enough is enough.

179
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,400
Once he passes this test,

180
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,080
he'll truly be one of us.

181
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,760
I was wrong.

182
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,640
<i>Don't mess this up for me.</i>

183
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,760
Eat more. It's good for you.

184
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,880
Here, wife.

185
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,160
Put it there.

186
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,320
- I want that.
- This one?

187
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,800
Have some meat.

188
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,560
A round face means good fortune.

189
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,640
Shouhua,

190
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,760
we should settle the match soon.

191
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,760
We need time to prepare.

192
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,240
Got it.

193
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,560
Madam, Kangning loves me.

194
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,960
This is my favorite.

195
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,280
The acting might get a bit exaggerated.

196
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,280
They'll give themselves away
before mother-in-law.

197
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,320
Silly.

198
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,360
My lord, here.

199
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,760
- What?
- Look around.

200
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,360
Is it good?

201
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,320
- This.
- Sour?

202
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,880
- Not bad.
- Try this.

203
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,560
Take this.

204
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,760
I'm full.

205
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,320
My lady, have this.

206
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,040
Yang Xian.

207
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,960
This cured meat has orange peel and herbs.

208
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,400
Leshan hates this flavor.

209
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,880
My wife said she follows my lead now.

210
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,280
Whatever I like, she likes too.

211
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,520
She's even fixed her picky habits.

212
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,960
That's what true harmony looks like.

213
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,520
My wife loves it.

214
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,720
It must be dipped in vinegar,

215
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,000
then ginger and garlic.

216
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,120
That's the best way. Try it.

217
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,440
Take this.

218
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,280
Thank you, my lord.

219
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,880
Taste it.

220
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,280
If you like it, have some more.

221
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,600
Fan, I'm so sorry. It slipped. My mistake.

222
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,400
I'm sorry.

223
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,080
Alright, alright.

224
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,680
You think I don't know
what mischief you're up to?

225
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,840
Young rich boys

226
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,760
always have bad friends.

227
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,320
They always trick him into being evil.

228
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,520
It's hard not to go astray.

229
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,880
But if he were truly wicked,

230
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,360
he'd never save others.

231
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,200
Haode, Qiongnu,

232
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,720
and the old lady.

233
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,160
He saved all their lives.

234
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,360
Marriage makes us family.

235
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,880
No matter the past grudges,

236
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,200
for that alone, he deserves a break.

237
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,360
Let's not dwell on old wrongs.

238
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,600
That's how family should be.

239
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,240
Making peace to his face,
but scheming behind his back.

240
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,240
Is that how the Li family acts?

241
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,000
<i>From birth till now,</i>

242
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,440
<i>even my parents never said this to me.</i>

243
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,080
Madam, you're right.

244
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,160
Since Yang Xian regrets his past,

245
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,440
we should bury the hatchet.

246
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,840
Get along well.

247
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,520
All grudges aired,

248
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,880
all anger gone.

249
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,880
Let's drink to move on.

250
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,280
- This one's on me.
- Me too.

251
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,440
Thank you for saving my granny
and my wife.

252
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,360
- Yuanming.
- Come.

253
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,440
- Drink it.
- Drink it.

254
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,120
- Yang Xian.
- And me.

255
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,520
- Together.
- Drink this.

256
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,640
- Drink one.
- Come on.

257
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,560
- Madam.
- Mother.

258
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,480
- Let's drink.
- Mother.

259
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,640
Madam.

260
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,640
- Here.
- I heard that.

261
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,120
- Arrange a match for Qiongnu?
- Madam.

262
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,800
- I'm going too.
- Yes.

263
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,720
Mom.

264
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,280
Don't make it too grand.

265
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,240
You'll scare them off.

266
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,120
I'll check on the food.

267
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,960
It's a match, not a battle.

268
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,880
- Madam.
- Mom.

269
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,360
- Mom.
- Eat up.

270
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,360
- Sit here.
- Not this.

271
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,480
- You barely ate.
- Have this.

272
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,120
- Good.
- Try this.

273
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,040
No.

274
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,840
This one helps circulation.

275
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,600
This one heals bruises.

276
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,720
This one is nice.

277
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,760
And this is for swelling and pain.

278
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,320
I twisted my ankle once,

279
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,440
and it healed in seven days.

280
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,800
According to Yangxi, there is ginseng

281
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,080
and galangal in it.

282
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,880
Lots of good stuff inside.

283
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,920
Thanks for thinking of me.

284
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,720
It's just a small injury. I'm fine.

285
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,600
No, you're not fine.
Make sure to apply the medicine.

286
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,200
If you can't reach your back,

287
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,360
let Leshan help you.

288
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,200
- Did you hear that?
- I heard that.

289
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,760
Yang Xian,

290
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,560
you didn't eat much at dinner.

291
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
Was it not good?

292
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,640
No, no, not at all.

293
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,720
Well, it's your first time here.

294
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,920
I can't let you sleep hungry.

295
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,040
Tell me what you want.
I'll make it for you.

296
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,600
I'd like some steamed egg custard.

297
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,640
Isn't that too much?

298
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,040
Not at all.

299
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,760
My custard's smooth and silky.

300
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,800
Even Leshan loves it.

301
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,840
Mom.

302
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,360
Don't listen to him.

303
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,960
It's too late for custard.

304
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,920
Such a hassle.

305
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,160
None of your business.

306
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,840
It's no trouble. I'll cook it now.

307
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,840
It'll be ready soon.

308
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,880
- Thanks, Madam.
- Mom.

309
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,200
Do it.

310
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,840
Done.

311
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,720
My back too.

312
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,240
Ask your servant.

313
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,840
You're my lawfully wedded wife.
Why let someone else do it?

314
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,080
Your mother said--

315
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,760
Stop making a big deal out of nothing.

316
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,640
Did you forget your forced wedding stunt?

317
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,400
I was promised to the He family.

318
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,960
Who's your wife?

319
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
Good thing you got into my bridal sedan.

320
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,280
Look at your four sisters.

321
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,520
They either married
to successful young men

322
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,360
or wealthy gentlemen known in the capital.

323
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,920
If you'd married that loser,

324
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,840
how could you hold your head up with them?

325
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,880
I forced the wedding to help you.

326
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,520
You should be thanking me.

327
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,920
Custard?

328
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,960
Medicine?

329
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,560
You want me to thank you for that?

330
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,480
You're such a shameless jerk!

331
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,160
I have to remind you.

332
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,200
Be careful if the Li family hears this.

333
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,840
Lose your temper, and it's all over.

334
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,040
Left in the carriage, right?

335
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,240
Using this laundry stick to hit a thief

336
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,320
is better than using a rolling pin.

337
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,880
- Take this!
- Madam, save me!

338
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,440
Your proud creation.

339
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,600
You better keep it.

340
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,200
Change is easier said than done.

341
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,800
Kind words can't beat showing the stakes.

342
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,600
We're not doing this to vent anger.

343
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,080
It's to show that Yang guy.

344
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,280
He must follow the rules
and treat his wife well.

345
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,000
If he acts up again, a line of people
are ready to teach him a lesson.

346
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,360
You don't even thank me for this.

347
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,480
Why are you blaming me?

348
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,600
Yes, yes. I appreciate your effort.
Thank you very much.

349
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,840
I owe you one, okay?

350
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,960
- Help!
- Stop it!

351
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,160
Help me!

352
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,800
- Stop! Help!
- What? What

353
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,080
Don't run!

354
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,280
Qiongnu.

355
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,560
- You!
- Qiongnu.

356
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,360
What's going on here?

357
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,800
I've put up with you all day.

358
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,440
If not for my mom,

359
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,040
why would I be kind to a kidnapper?

360
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,000
Fine, fine.

361
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,480
Qiongnu, did you see that?

362
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,240
- Your sister's so feisty.
- You!

363
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,880
Couples bickering is normal.

364
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,040
Holding that isn't right.

365
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,320
Put it down. Okay?

366
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,280
Why all the noise
in the middle of the night?

367
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,400
Madam, help me!

368
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,440
- Madam.
- Come here.

369
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,440
- Madam.
- Leshan.

370
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,400
What now?

371
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,560
- Drop it.
- Shouhua's here.

372
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,880
Leshan, the new son-in-law's here.

373
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,240
The neighbors can hear you yelling.

374
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,200
- You're embarrassing Mom.
- Exactly.

375
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,920
He wants me to thank him
for kidnapping me.

376
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,040
What a shameless thief!

377
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,640
Nobody stop me today.

378
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,920
If we indulge his arrogance,

379
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,640
he'll keep bullying me forever!

380
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,720
I won't take that from him. No way!

381
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,640
- Mr. Du.
- Mr. Du.

382
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,560
- Be the judge.
- You…

383
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,840
- You're wrong.
- Come here.

384
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,480
How could you say this?

385
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,920
He deserves it.
Leshan, let him go for my sake.

386
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,840
No way!

387
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,400
Drop it!

388
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,960
What did I do in my past life?

389
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
You're a troublemaker.

390
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,760
You've been married just a few days.

391
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,040
You scare him with this?

392
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,840
- I--
- Doing this for everyone to hear?

393
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,320
Put it down!

394
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,600
Put it down.

395
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,720
Leshan.

396
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,360
Madam.

397
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,240
- That's okay.
- I can't handle this wife anymore.

398
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,280
- I'm truly sorry this time.
- Good kid.

399
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,560
Be patient. I'll have her change.

400
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,600
- Okay.
- How miserable.

401
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,520
You can't take it.

402
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,640
Write a letter of divorce.
We're done today.

403
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,800
- Leshan.
- Hey.

404
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,000
- Drop it.
- Yang Xian.

405
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,240
This kid.

406
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,040
A royal marriage can't be dissolved.

407
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,280
Divorce? Not a chance.

408
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,960
- Stop it.
- Mom.

409
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,520
I'll marry someone better.

410
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,920
You'll die alone here.

411
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,520
Spend your life as a lonely widow!

412
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,520
- Calm down, Madam.
- Mom.

413
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,640
Mom.

414
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,920
Mom.

415
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,680
Fine. I was wrong, okay?

416
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,840
Wow! You admit you're wrong?

417
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,880
You scared him half to death.

418
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,440
I must've raised a warrior, huh?

419
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,440
You're braver than most men.

420
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,680
Mom.

421
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,040
He fell on his own.

422
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,200
It's not really my fault.

423
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,120
Still arguing with me?

424
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,160
Even if you didn't chase him,

425
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,760
you still scared him.

426
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,920
I…

427
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,680
Shouhua.

428
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,160
Mom.

429
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,840
Yang Xian broke his leg.

430
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,960
He needs someone to care of him.

431
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,560
Let her make amends.

432
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,520
Besides,

433
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,080
if you really hurt her,

434
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,960
you'd regret it yourself.

435
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Today, I'm putting my foot down.

436
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,080
From now on, you're staying home.

437
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,880
Focus on taking care of your husband.

438
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,880
No one else is allowed to help.

439
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,880
If there's even a slight mistake,

440
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,800
you won't set foot in this house again.

441
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,960
- Mom.
- Don't even call me mom.

442
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,880
Mom, please calm down.

443
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,040
I've sent Qiansheng to the Yangs.

444
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,840
I told them you're keeping her longer.

445
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,680
So, the couple can stay a few more days.

446
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,720
Once his leg heals,

447
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,840
we'll send him back.

448
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,480
To avoid alarming the Yang family.

449
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,960
Alright, let's go.

450
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,480
Let's go.

451
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,240
What a mess.

452
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,560
- Go take care of him.
- Sure.

453
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,920
We're off.

454
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
It hurts.

455
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,120
I'll be gentle.

456
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,040
You're suffocating me.

457
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,520
No, no, not at all.

458
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,200
Be gentler.

459
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,200
You're so clumsy.

460
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,080
- I'm hot.
- What?

461
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,640
I said I'm hot.

462
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,240
Water.

463
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,200
Anyone? I need water.

464
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,840
Coming, coming.

465
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,680
Here, here. Water's here.

466
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,960
Madam! Leshan--

467
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,640
No, nothing happened.

468
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,720
What are you doing? Keep fanning.

469
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,680
Chunlai.

470
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,360
Boil the medicine longer.

471
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,600
Chunlai, why are you taking over?

472
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,000
Chunlai.

473
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,000
My lord, time to drink your medicine.

474
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,400
I know you're mad at me.

475
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,000
But I've stayed up caring for you.

476
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,760
Up at midnight to make your medicine.

477
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,280
My eyes are red, fingers burned.

478
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,000
Please, consider my effort.

479
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,920
At least drink a little.

480
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,040
Such care and effort,

481
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,440
just so I'll take the medicine?

482
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,280
Afraid your mom will scold?

483
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,000
What's your real motive?

484
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,320
You're misunderstanding me again.

485
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,680
If you don't drink, your leg won't heal.

486
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,480
It'll hurt more than just you.

487
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,440
It'll ruin my peace too.

488
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,600
Seeing you in pain every night,

489
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,480
I can't bear it either.

490
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,360
My lord.

491
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,760
Do you know what's in this medicine?

492
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,720
It's arsenic.

493
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,400
In less than an hour,

494
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,440
you'll bleed from every pore,

495
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,520
your insides will rot.

496
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,200
Who says I can't refuse an imperial match?

497
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,840
I'd rather be a widow

498
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,120
than stay married to you.

499
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,840
You vile woman.

500
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,640
What's wrong?

501
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,240
- What's going on?
- Mom.

502
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,080
- Shouhua.
- Good kid.

503
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,400
- It's okay?
- He insists I poisoned him.

504
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,840
He even spilled the medicine bowl.

505
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,720
He's clearly wronging me.

506
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,120
Kid,

507
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,520
you've really wronged her this time.

508
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,040
I got the medicine myself.

509
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,760
After it was brewed,

510
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,680
I made her taste it first,

511
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,440
fearing bitterness.

512
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,000
Besides, you're her husband,

513
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,320
and this is her family home.

514
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,960
If anything happens to you,
she'd be the first to blame.

515
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,520
Li Leshan.

516
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,240
Naughty girl.

517
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,280
He's being dramatic, refusing medicine.

518
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,040
Ignoring my intentions.

519
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,560
If he dares next time…

520
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,200
You little troublemaker.

521
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,520
Mom, the Yangs sent someone to fetch them.

522
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,840
Weren't they staying more days?

523
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,280
Why?

524
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,720
They said Lady Jieyu is visiting home.

525
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,960
They rushed to escort the newlyweds back.

526
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,080
Li Leshan,

527
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,240
your doom is near.

528
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,120
YANG MANSION

529
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,320
Your sister-in-law

530
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,720
isn't virtuous at all.

531
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,280
She lacks grace, manners, and decorum.

532
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,400
Other daughters-in-law

533
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,360
respect their mothers-in-law.

534
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,440
But her?

535
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,440
She fears nothing.

536
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,200
Rules and customs mean nothing to her.

537
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,640
You won't find another
like her in Bianjing.

538
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,800
True.

539
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,200
She defies her mother-in-law,
bullies her husband,

540
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,520
and is terribly fierce.

541
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,000
I say take her to court.

542
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,600
Let them deal with her as an example.

543
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,160
But we care
about Lady Jieyu's reputation

544
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,520
and our family name.

545
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,120
That's why we endure this.

546
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,000
Sister,

547
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,520
is she truly this vicious?

548
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,160
If not completely,

549
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,920
at least mostly true.

550
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,760
My brother is so lawless,

551
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,880
yet he's afraid of her.

552
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,520
It's strange.

553
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,000
With others, he shows no mercy.

554
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,600
But with her,

555
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,960
he even softens his tone.

556
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,760
Like they say, everyone meets their match.

557
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,920
Why blame my son?

558
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,440
Anyone facing her would be wary too.

559
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,560
Why don't you try taking her hit?

560
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,200
Seems she's fiercer

561
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,560
than I heard in the palace.

562
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,280
Enough.

563
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,480
She rarely visits her family.

564
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,920
You keep pestering her with complaints.

565
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,120
It's all just trivial household matters.

566
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,040
Aren't you worried she'll get annoyed?

567
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,000
Don't worry. These are all my confidants.

568
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,960
Daughter,

569
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,800
you've always had your own mind.

570
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,280
Since entering the palace,
you've gained His Majesty's deep favor.

571
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,120
I shouldn't say much,

572
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,600
but palace life changes rapidly.

573
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,600
I can't help but worry about you.

574
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,000
Her Majesty has no child, no favor.

575
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,840
They say Shang's rising fast.

576
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,600
Even her brothers gained noble titles.

577
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,240
A mere merchant's family

578
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,880
rose so quickly in a few years.

579
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,120
I wish to help you,

580
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,200
but I lack power.

581
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,680
My rank is too low to intervene.

582
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,280
You must plan ahead, daughter.

583
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,600
Don't let others steal your glory.

584
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,720
That Li came from
a low tea-seller's family.

585
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,360
She relies on ties
to the Shen and Du families.

586
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,800
She's become arrogant before me.

587
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,640
Now that you're back,

588
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,000
it's time to teach her a lesson.

589
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,760
Don't let her bring trouble to our family,

590
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,080
or we'll have no way to escape it.

591
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,400
Lady Jieyu, Master,

592
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,800
they have returned.

593
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,120
Carry me back to my room.

594
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,440
My lord, Lady Jieyu is calling for you.

595
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,640
I need to go back.

596
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,440
I don't care who it is.

597
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,560
This…

598
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,600
Hurry, hurry, go back.

599
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,840
Quickly, now!

600
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,800
My lady, Lady Jieyu is calling for you.
Don't keep the noble waiting.

601
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,320
Greetings, Lady Jieyu.

602
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,960
Why don't I see Xian here?

603
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,160
I didn't report earlier to spare worry.

604
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,920
Since you asked, I'll tell you the truth.

605
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,920
My husband returned home with me.

606
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,960
He drank too much at the feast.

607
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,120
He fell down the stairs.

608
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,040
We asked Liu, a renowned bone physician,
to see him.

609
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,040
His injuries were swollen.

610
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,640
Liu realigned his bones.

611
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,280
He prescribed an ancestral remedy.

612
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,200
One topical ointment to wash daily

613
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,160
and an internal formula taken with wine.

614
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,240
His skilled hands worked wonders.

615
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,840
After three days, he improved a lot.

616
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,680
But today's travel made him worse.

617
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,720
I tried to convince him,

618
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,800
Lady Jieyu is his sister.
She'll never blame him.

619
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,920
That's why he's resting in his room.

620
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,880
I apologize for his absence on his behalf.

621
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,160
How could he fall for no reason?

622
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,000
Clearly, the Li family caused this.

623
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,800
Don't misbehave in front of Lady Jieyu.

624
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,920
We're all family. No need for formalities.

625
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,840
My poor son.

626
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,800
He married such a woman.

627
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,480
It's truly a family misfortune.

628
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,680
Daughter,

629
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,680
you must punish her for your brother.

630
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,000
Please seek justice for us.

631
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,320
Don't let this evil wife get away with it.

632
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,520
Slap her 50 times to teach her respect.

633
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,760
<i>Oh no, she's going to accuse me later.</i>

634
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,320
<i>I might seize that weak one</i>
<i>before she retaliates.</i>

635
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,720
<i>There's no going back to my home.</i>

636
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,560
<i>Worst case, I'll cut my hair and be a nun.</i>

637
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,360
<i>Your imperial family rules everything,</i>

638
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,280
<i>but not the world outside.</i>

639
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,480
Bring it.

640
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,480
Open it.

641
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,840
This golden rod is from His Majesty.

642
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,680
It's yours now.

643
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,400
This…

644
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,360
Thank you, my Lady.

645
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,360
Lady Jieyu,

646
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,080
you're not here for justice.

647
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,360
You're encouraging her arrogance.

648
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,360
His Majesty mentioned promoting my father.

649
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,680
I told him
officials should earn promotions.

650
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,480
It can't just be
because of his favor for me.

651
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,880
Making exceptions and asking for favors

652
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,560
would cause criticism.

653
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,040
This cannot happen.

654
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,760
You…

655
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,560
You don't care about me

656
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,400
or our family?

657
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,560
I care for the family.
That's why I refuse.

658
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,680
The Yang family
already has wealth and honor.

659
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,760
Not from the great talent
of my brother and father,

660
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,520
but from the ladies
who married into the palace.

661
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:51,600
If your fate
relies on fragile connections,

662
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,360
how can you forget what you have

663
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,600
and dream about more?

664
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,080
You're accusing your own father?

665
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,200
That's out of line.

666
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,920
Apologize to Lady Jieyu.

667
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,640
Forgive us, Lady Jieyu.

668
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,160
Since ancient times,

669
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,360
family disgrace

670
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,680
starts with neglecting rules.

671
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,880
Leshan, this golden rod is for you.

672
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,040
Use it to set the Yang family straight.

673
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:32,920
One day, if someone ever
commit crimes and bully others,

674
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,000
no matter if it is your husband

675
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,240
or your brothers-in-law,
even your parents-in-law,

676
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,160
you have the right to discipline them.

677
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,920
This is not only my decision.

678
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,080
His Majesty approves.

679
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,640
Lady Jieyu, you're so just and wise.

680
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,560
I'm deeply grateful.

681
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,840
Get up.

682
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:12,680
GENTLE BREEZE AND PLEASANT MOON

683
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,040
Master.

684
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,920
But your injuries…

685
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,160
Sure.

686
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,960
SPRING BREEZE AND AUTUMN MOON

687
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,440
Lady Jieyu, why don't you go in?

688
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,760
He doesn't want to see his sister.

689
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,640
Out of the four of us siblings,

690
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,920
he was always closest to me.

691
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,400
When Father sent me to the palace,
the family was overjoyed,

692
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,440
except him.

693
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,960
He came at night,
trying to help me escape.

694
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,080
Father nearly broke his legs for that.

695
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,640
He was bedridden for six months.

696
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,040
Leshan,

697
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,360
my brother wasn't always this way,

698
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,440
spoiled by Mother, beaten by Father,

699
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,680
but no one ever
taught him right from wrong.

700
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,480
Let me ask you a favor.

701
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,400
Guide him in the future.

702
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,320
Don't let him go astray or get ruined.

703
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,760
Lady Jieyu,

704
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,880
teaching morals
is a family's responsibility.

705
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,080
I'm just a taken woman. I wouldn't dare.

706
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,360
If you can reform him,

707
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,040
a year from now,
if you wish to leave the family,

708
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,080
I'll request His Majesty personally
to grant your divorce.

709
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,360
You mean it?

710
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,080
Let's make a deal.

711
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,880
Okay, deal.

712
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,800
Since you care about him so much,

713
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,000
why not go in and see him?

714
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,800
Lady Jieyu, it's time to return.

715
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,160
Li Leshan.

716
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,080
Don't forget your promise.

717
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,800
If you fail,

718
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,680
you'll stay here forever.

719
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,080
<i>I'll leave here, no matter what.</i>

720
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,000
What an ungrateful girl.

721
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,600
She's never been on my side.

722
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,440
If she wasn't sent to the palace,

723
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,320
she wouldn't have such glory.

724
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,640
We worked hard for her future,

725
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,440
but she repays us with resentment.

726
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,080
Helping that wicked woman to bully me.

727
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,360
Unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable.

728
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,720
Father shouldn't have sent her
to the palace.

729
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,120
He should've sent me instead.

730
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,840
She is talented in music and art,

731
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,360
smart, poised,

732
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,800
and favored by Her Highness.
What about you?

733
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,320
Sister, I'm better at many things.

734
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,360
- Enough.
- So--

735
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,920
Instead of finding a solution,

736
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,400
you two are having squabbles.

737
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,160
How useless.

738
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,440
Mom,

739
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,400
what if she loses that rod?

740
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,600
An imperial gift. She'd guard it fiercely.

741
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,760
How could she lose it?

742
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,000
Bad idea. She wouldn't fear that.

743
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,160
But this could be serious.

744
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,680
She could be charged
with disrespecting the royal family.

745
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,240
It's a big deal.

746
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,880
Once we have this against her,

747
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,520
we control her life or death.

748
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,920
Even a fierce tigress would bow

749
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,760
before Mom after that.

750
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,520
Go, bring Yinping here.

751
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,680
Master, does it still hurt?

752
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,360
I don't mean to meddle,

753
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,720
but you and the lady just don't mix.

754
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,720
Even the smallest thing causes trouble.

755
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,680
It's better to stay away from her.

756
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,360
Master,

757
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,840
my brother once broke his leg.

758
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,840
I massaged him often

759
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,200
to make walking easier.

760
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,560
Would you like me to help?

761
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,760
My lady.

762
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,640
If I see you acting like this again,

763
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,680
I'll cut off that hand first.

764
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,880
Qiansheng!

765
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,560
Qiansheng.

766
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,160
Where did everyone go?

767
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,480
My lady, Master.

768
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,280
Listen up, everyone.

769
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,440
From now on,

770
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,240
only male servants may attend here.

771
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,360
Maids in the courtyard must obey me.

772
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,720
No one enters here without orders.

773
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,880
If he bothers a maid, let me know.

774
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,160
I'll handle it.

775
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,320
But if anyone

776
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,520
flirts or oversteps

777
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:11,960
or ever tries to lure him out for treats,

778
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,040
bully others, and act immorally…

779
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,880
If I hear that,

780
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,960
I'll smash them

781
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,960
with this golden rod.

782
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,320
Li Haode,

783
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,960
do you dare interfere with me?

784
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,400
Don't tell me you're jealous too.

785
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,680
I've always been dominant.

786
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,680
Even my dog

787
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,960
must only wag its tail for me.

788
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,160
No one else is allowed.

789
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,280
And my husband is mine to control.

790
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,640
So, naturally,

791
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,840
I'll watch over him closely, always.

792
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,840
You…

793
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,800
What?

794
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,680
From today,

795
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,160
you're under my care.

796
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,600
Got a problem?

797
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,920
Whatever.

798
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,120
Everyone, clear?

799
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,040
Sure.

800
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,240
Master Jiang.

801
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,320
Madam is calling you.

802
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,640
Sure. I'll take my leave now.

803
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,000
Don't take it too fast.

804
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,360
Honey cakes are delicious.

805
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,680
The sesame outside smells amazing.

806
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,040
And the inside is so soft.

807
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,400
Better than what I eat here.

808
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,520
Of course.

809
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,440
I made these myself.

810
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,800
I didn't let them do it,
worried they'd overcook it.

811
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,480
I'm glad you like it.

812
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,200
My mother came to visit me.

813
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,200
Even your mom left.

814
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,080
She wants us to have some private time.

815
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,120
Why are you here?

816
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,320
Don't be naughty.

817
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,840
Mom.

818
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,520
Enough.

819
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,040
Yang Xian, tell me.

820
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,840
Has she treated you well?

821
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,240
If she has been neglecting you,
I'll handle it.

822
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,680
Mom, who is really your child?

823
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,800
Don't worry, Madam.

824
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,720
I'm getting better.

825
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,600
Don't be careless.

826
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,960
Injuries to bones take time to heal.

827
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,760
If you don't take care,

828
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,400
it could get worse.

829
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,280
When you get older, it will hurt terribly.

830
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,520
- Bone soup.
- Okay.

831
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,080
I also made you some bone soup.

832
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,080
Drink some.

833
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,480
