00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,480
EPISODE 17

2
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,480
You can go to a place like Xiongzhou,

3
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,640
but do you plan
to take Shouhua with you too?

4
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,520
Can she endure the cold at the border?
You're putting her life in danger.

5
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,920
Why do I feel you care about Shouhua
even more than I do?

6
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,440
I'll be honest with you.

7
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,320
Before you got married,
I met Li Shouhua once.

8
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,200
You poor pedantic scholar!

9
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,480
You make a living by writing.

10
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,600
What does my cursing that shrew
have to do with you?

11
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,040
It's not your place to speak up.

12
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,840
- Chunlai.
- I'm not harsh enough.

13
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,360
- What's going on?
- I won't pay you.

14
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,240
- Why are you doing this?
- A poor scholar is arguing with someone.

15
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,080
Everything must be done reasonably.

16
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,400
If you don't get along with your wife,
get a divorce.

17
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,000
No need to harbor further grudges.

18
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,560
I can write a divorce letter,
not a letter cursing your wife.

19
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,480
You…

20
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,720
Stop the sedan.

21
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,840
LETTER WRITING ON CHARGE

22
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,880
Go ahead.

23
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,040
Sir.

24
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,320
My lady would like a letter to be written

25
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,960
for her husband far away.

26
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,560
It doesn't matter what is written.

27
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,080
Just express her thoughts of longing.
Can you write it?

28
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,040
So, she wants to ask her husband
to return soon.

29
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,160
I can write it. One moment.

30
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,320
My lady.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,840
What are you…

32
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,800
Okay.

33
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,800
My lady's husband
has been deceased for a long time.

34
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,520
She said you write letters well.

35
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,000
This is a token of gratitude.

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,040
There'll be snow tonight
that can freeze you to death.

37
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,560
Hurry back home.

38
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
Let's go.

39
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,600
Be careful.

40
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,640
So, what did you write in that letter?

41
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,680
Back then, I was annoyed
by that rude customer.

42
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,120
I thought she was illiterate. So,
I just wrote something to brush it off.

43
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,320
Little did I expect that she…

44
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,280
When I saw her again,
she had become your wife.

45
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,120
Thankfully, she did not recognize me.

46
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,800
Otherwise, how could I keep staying here?

47
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,760
I see.

48
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,000
I once vowed

49
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,240
to never seek beauty
or wealth in the future

50
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,480
but to find a virtuous wife
with good character and a kind heart.

51
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,040
I never thought you would be so lucky
to have such a wife.

52
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,920
You must cherish this fortune.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,040
Shouhua is a delicate lady.
She can't go with you to the harsh border.

54
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,200
The news came
from the Ministry of Personnel.

55
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,640
It's not officially appointed.
There's still room to maneuver.

56
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,840
I know you never bow to others,

57
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,960
but for the sake
of Shouhua and your mother,

58
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,520
what's the harm
in bowing your head just once?

59
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,600
Sang the Stone,

60
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,480
I never expected that one day

61
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,520
you, a hard stone, would speak such words.

62
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,600
Rest assured.

63
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,720
I know what to do.

64
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,520
LIUFANG HOUSE

65
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,720
FANG

66
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,040
I want to go home. I want to go home.

67
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,440
Do you hear me? I want to go home.

68
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,200
Master Du, my master
is waiting in the study.

69
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,640
Please go inside.

70
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,120
Mother-in-law.

71
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,640
You've finished?

72
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,120
Madam Du. My lady.

73
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,680
The imperial court has conferred
an official post on Master Du.

74
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,960
Master Du's been named Assistant
Officer of Construction Bureau

75
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,720
to the Bureau of Historiography.

76
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,720
Bureau of Historiography?

77
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,200
Shouhua,

78
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,960
what is the position?

79
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,080
The imperial court
regards the Zhaowen Bureau,

80
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,320
the Bureau of Historiography,

81
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,120
and the Jixian Academy
as the Three Bureaus.

82
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,040
Talents from all over are gathered
to fill the positions.

83
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,000
This shows that His Majesty
cherishes and values talent

84
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,080
and is unwilling to send your son
to a distant post.

85
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,960
This is to have him serve in the capital.

86
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,480
Madam Du, you may not know that those
who can enter the Bureau of Historiography

87
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
will one day be the key ministers
of the court,

88
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,840
close by His Majesty's side.

89
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,680
It's truly a most desirable

90
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,920
and enviable post of unlimited glory.

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,360
Congratulations to you both.

92
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,640
The bitterness has ended,
and the sweetness begins for us.

93
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,680
Wealth and glory are yet to come.

94
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,240
If one becomes an official
for the sake of promotion and wealth,

95
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,880
he'll undoubtedly be a corrupt official.

96
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,680
To benefit the people
and to serve the country loyally

97
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,080
is the true duty of an educated man
who becomes an official.

98
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,680
As Yangxi's family, we should
live modestly, uphold righteousness,

99
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,040
and remain good to the end.

100
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,480
Only then can we accumulate virtue
and blessings

101
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,040
so our family is safe and prosperous.

102
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,880
From now on,
do not speak these words again.

103
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,240
Yes. I'm truly sorry.

104
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,480
I've remembered your teachings as well.

105
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,520
This is great.

106
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,680
It's great news.

107
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,480
Daughter, it's great news.

108
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,800
Madam Du, it's tremendous good news.

109
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,200
Yangxi has been accepted
into one of the Three Bureaus.

110
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
I heard about it earlier at the tea house

111
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,920
that many people scurry in all directions
to get into the Three Bureaus.

112
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,160
They even offer a hefty sum
for a recommendation.

113
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,600
I never expected
such a stroke of good fortune

114
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,280
to befall Yangxi.

115
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,040
It's all thanks
to Yangxi's genuine talent and learning.

116
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,480
Someday, if Yangxi
becomes a high official,

117
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,720
Shouhua,

118
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,400
you'll be a lady of noble rank then, and…

119
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,560
Let's hold a banquet!
We must celebrate properly.

120
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,520
We must celebrate properly for Yangxi.

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,880
He was dragged off
to a banquet by his fellow scholars.

122
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,240
I'm afraid he can't get away
for the moment.

123
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,160
On his behalf, I apologize to all of you.

124
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,800
Let's not wait for him and start eating.

125
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,680
No worries.
It's his first foray into officialdom.

126
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,000
If he wants a smooth career in the future,
he has to connect to his fellow scholars.

127
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,760
When they extended an invitation,

128
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,640
he couldn't reject their good intentions.
Being late is not his fault.

129
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,480
Yes, that's right.

130
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,920
It's not his fault.

131
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
How about we start first?

132
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,240
The dishes have gone cold.
How about we reheat them first?

133
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,120
Let's wait a little longer.

134
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,720
There is no rush.

135
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,960
Chunlai,

136
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,200
heat up the dishes.

137
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,680
- Then I'll also…
- No, stop.

138
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,360
Fuhui, you are pregnant. Let me do it.

139
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,360
It's fine. No rush. We're not hungry.

140
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,560
Mom, while having dinner,

141
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,240
you barely ate a few bites. Eat some more.

142
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,400
Mom.

143
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,760
- Bravo!
- Du Yangxi

144
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,720
is outright rude.

145
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,680
He becomes so arrogant
upon sudden success.

146
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,480
He didn't show respect
to his mother-in-law.

147
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,880
Shouhua was clearly forcing a smile.

148
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,440
I feel sorry for her.

149
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,680
Perhaps there is some urgent matter
that held him up.

150
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,520
You should stop judging him.

151
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,520
Cousin, why haven't I seen it?

152
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,440
- It's not here. I don't see it.
- I remember it was right around this area.

153
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,240
Be patient.
I'm here helping you look for it.

154
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,720
In my opinion,

155
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,840
this street has plenty
of mustard sauce shoppers.

156
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,240
Why must it specifically be the Wu's?

157
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,680
Don't mention it.

158
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,320
Last night, my wife got up and insisted

159
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,160
on having cucumbers
dipped in mustard sauce.

160
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,160
Isn't that strange?

161
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,280
Just now, during the dinner, she wanted to
eat dried apricot that is sweet

162
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,000
with a hint of sour
and a bit of saltiness.

163
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,600
It's truly a suffering.

164
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,600
As for me,

165
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,240
I almost wish I could carry
that belly of hers myself.

166
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,080
Cousin?

167
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,640
Cousin, what are you looking at?

168
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,720
Take a look for yourself.

169
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,800
This is bad.
Something terrible has happened.

170
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,000
Cousin! Cousin, wait for me.
Something terrible has happened.

171
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,520
Mother-in-law…

172
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,160
Mother-in-law?

173
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,320
Shouhua,

174
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,120
Shiyi cherished you so deeply.

175
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,320
Your affection as husband and wife
ran deep.

176
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,960
How can you bear to let him die alone?

177
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,320
You mustn't abandon him.

178
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,200
I'm begging you.

179
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,040
- I'm begging you.
- Mother-in-law.

180
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,920
- Mother-in-law, please don't.
- I'm begging you.

181
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,840
I don't want to die.

182
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,200
You heartless and ungrateful woman!

183
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,640
My son has been dead for only two days

184
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,520
and you've cast aside the marital fidelity

185
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,760
and the filial respect for your elders!

186
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,200
Then I will confine you here.

187
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,120
I won't beat you or scold you, but I will
withhold food and water from you.

188
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,680
Let's see how many days you can last.

189
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,440
Mother-in-law, don't!

190
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,360
Mother-in-law!

191
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,040
Mother-in-law, open the door!
Mother-in-law!

192
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,000
Did you have a nightmare?

193
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,600
I dreamt of many past events.

194
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,840
What kind of past events?

195
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,040
Back then,

196
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,320
my late husband had just passed away.

197
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,400
My ex-mother-in-law was utterly devastated

198
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,920
and unfortunately developed hysteria.

199
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,040
She locked me inside the room

200
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,160
without providing food or drink,

201
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,880
wanting me to join in death with her son.

202
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,720
Had it not been for my mother
going to find me,

203
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,560
I would have been dead for long.

204
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,920
I didn't expect there to be such
a ruthless and cruel person in this world.

205
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,880
That day,

206
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,800
my sedan chair had gone a long distance,

207
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,840
yet my ex-mother-in-law
was still cursing incessantly.

208
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,320
She blamed me

209
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,760
for abandoning her son

210
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,240
and cursed me never again
to have someone close in this life

211
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,680
but to suffer eternal loneliness.

212
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,600
But even if it meant to forsake
my later husband and his mother,

213
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,280
I still wanted to live on.

214
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,400
I wanted to live.

215
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,640
He gave you the pearl curtain

216
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,680
because he wanted you to live well.

217
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,840
Being able to marry you

218
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,640
is indeed my fortune.

219
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,480
Yet I often doubt

220
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,000
whether the heavens
truly have had mercy on me

221
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,880
by bestowing me with someone

222
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,520
willing to dissolve the curse

223
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,040
and shelter me for the rest of my life.

224
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,880
It's late.

225
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,680
Stop thinking about this.

226
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Go to sleep now.

227
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,760
<i>I've waited for so long,</i>

228
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,160
<i>hoping you would open up your heart to me.</i>

229
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,000
<i>Why only until today</i>

230
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,200
<i>have you finally responded to me?</i>

231
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,000
<i>It's too late.</i>
<i>It's too late for everything now.</i>

232
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,080
<i>Shouhua,</i>

233
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,800
<i>we won't have a future together.</i>

234
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,080
To celebrate your promotion,
your mother-in-law

235
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,880
specially prepared a banquet.

236
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,360
As for you,

237
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,880
you didn't even show up.

238
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,440
It's against the etiquette
for a son-in-law.

239
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,520
Hurry up and go apologize.

240
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,240
Mother, it was my scholars' invitation.
It's truly hard to excuse myself.

241
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,760
I've already apologized to you repeatedly.

242
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,600
It's your mother-in-law
that you should be sorry for.

243
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,040
What's the use of apologizing to me?

244
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,720
Eat your breakfast.
Hurry and go to apologize.

245
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,960
Mother-in-law,
today is the beginning of autumn.

246
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,960
This is the red bean soup
that I have just cooked.

247
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,560
Please have some.

248
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,880
Mother-in-law?

249
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,560
Mother, slow down.

250
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,400
Dear, what happened to your mother?

251
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,840
My mother treats you
like her own daughter.

252
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,520
Yet you sowed discord
between my mother and me.

253
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,600
What exactly are your intentions?

254
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,680
Du Yangxi, come out with me.

255
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,680
Shouhua is your wife,

256
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,720
and she is highly self-respecting.

257
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,680
How could you embarrass her
in front of me and the maid?

258
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,080
How do you expect her to carry on?

259
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,600
What?

260
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,640
I was merely a bit harsh on her
and you're already pitying her.

261
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,200
What did you say?

262
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,320
That I was a bit harsh
and you're already pitying her.

263
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,920
If you truly care for her,
it's actually an easy matter to address.

264
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,840
You can just marry her.

265
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,480
When she becomes your wife,
you can care for her however you wish.

266
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,160
You scoundrel!

267
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,480
How dare you insult
and slander her like this!

268
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,720
That day, you were not
drinking with fellow scholars.

269
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,800
You were currying favor
and seeking connections with the powerful.

270
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,160
Rumors about you and someone from
the Yu family have even reached my ears.

271
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,000
Facing Shouhua and your mother,
my conscience cannot bear it.

272
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,560
I have only one question for you.

273
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,520
Do you even know

274
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,440
what you are doing these days?

275
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,040
My business does not need your meddling.

276
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,840
If you are this presumptuous again
in the future,

277
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,600
our sworn brotherhood

278
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,520
will come to an end.

279
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,440
Don't bother to feign magnanimity.

280
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,880
I will move out today.

281
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,480
From now on, I will consider
I do not have you as a sworn brother.

282
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,880
Yuanming…

283
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,680
Fine, if that's the case,

284
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,840
don't blame me
for not cherishing our old bond.

285
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,000
From now on,

286
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,880
you are neither my friend nor my brother.

287
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,240
Our brotherly bond is broken.

288
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,960
Once you leave this door,

289
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,600
we'll go our separate ways.

290
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,680
Even should we meet again in the future,
we'll be no more than strangers.

291
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,440
Let him go.

292
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,160
Wasn't it agreed upon

293
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,240
that he'd assume his post
in a couple of days?

294
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,360
Why would he rush to move out now?

295
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,160
Even if he had to leave, he should
say goodbye to your mother in person.

296
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,480
Shouhua, can't you bear to let him go?

297
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,480
You can just chase him back.

298
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,240
You…

299
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,000
You are being unreasonable.

300
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,320
<i>Shouhua,</i>

301
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,920
<i>you are so virtuous and gentle.</i>

302
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,520
<i>You deserve</i>
<i>a secure and worry-free future.</i>

303
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,000
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>I can't accompany you until old age.</i>

304
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,160
<i>I have to find</i>
<i>someone suitable and reliable for you</i>

305
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,800
<i>to dispel the nightmares that haunt you</i>

306
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,480
<i>and to protect you for life.</i>

307
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,280
<i>Sang Yanrang,</i>

308
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,440
<i>you must not disappoint me.</i>

309
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,200
Lingyao.

310
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,080
- Lingyao!
- Yes?

311
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,640
Master, what are your orders?

312
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,280
Clean out the west wing at once.

313
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,320
- I have another use for it.
- Yes.

314
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,320
- Greetings, Madam Du.
- Greetings, Madam Du.

315
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Greetings, my lady.

316
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,520
Are they the new maids?

317
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,520
Mother,

318
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,000
Jinnu can sing well, and Fufu can dance.

319
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,680
They can keep Shouhua company

320
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,800
and relieve your boredom.

321
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,040
You've forgotten your roots.

322
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,120
You've forgotten your roots!

323
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,640
Mother.

324
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,680
Shouhua, please arrange for them
to stay in the west wing.

325
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,280
Yes.

326
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,280
You've spilled it.

327
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,840
Sweep the floor clean first
and then check the kitchen.

328
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,760
Choose some light tasks to do.

329
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,960
- Yes.
- Yes.

330
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,880
You are just a menial maid.

331
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,280
Who has given you the right
to bully the two of them?

332
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,760
If I don't give you a few lashes today,
you won't understand the hierarchy.

333
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,560
My lady, help! My lady!

334
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,840
Master, what are you doing?

335
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,080
This morning when I left,
I had specifically instructed

336
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,320
that the two of them
were gifted a superior official,

337
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,840
and another arrangement, where in this
household, they'll be treated as guests.

338
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,640
Yet she didn't take my words
to heart at all.

339
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,800
She had them carry water for laundry
and tend the fire for cooking.

340
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,840
Now look. Two pretty girls have bruises
on their legs and blisters on their faces.

341
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,800
Tell me. Doesn't she deserve to be beaten?

342
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,840
In this household,

343
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,800
your mother spins and weaves
day and night, unwilling to slack off.

344
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,160
I am also diligent in everything,
doing things myself.

345
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,560
From top to bottom,
everyone has to work to eat.

346
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,240
Sangma only has one pair
of hands and feet.

347
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,640
If you're reluctant to let them work,
who will boil water for them

348
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,800
to wash their faces
and serve them tea and meals?

349
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,240
Do you want me to serve them personally

350
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,520
or do it by yourself?

351
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,240
I will not argue with you.

352
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,960
But as for a maid,
I still have control over her.

353
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,400
Get out of my way. Move.

354
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,240
- My lady?
- Shouhua?

355
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,600
It's all my fault.

356
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,320
Please do not beat my lady.

357
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,600
- If you must beat someone, beat me.
- Sangma.

358
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,920
- Don't cry.
- Don't beat my lady.

359
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,040
- Shouhua, let me look at your injury.
- I'm truly fine.

360
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,920
Don't make a fuss
or Madam Du will hear this.

361
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,520
- Sangma, go get the medicine quickly.
- Yes.

362
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,760
- Sangma, you may leave now.
- Yes.

363
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,080
You are not a lecher.

364
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,360
You never verbally hurt others
and certainly won't whip a maid.

365
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,160
Why did you do such act to push me?

366
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,600
What difficulties have you encountered

367
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,480
to make you refuse

368
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,880
to utter half a word of truth to me,

369
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,680
someone who shares the same bed with you?

370
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,920
You are really smart, Shouhua.

371
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,160
Then I will be honest with you.

372
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,560
I can only choose

373
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,680
either to part with you
or assume my post in Xiongzhou.

374
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,600
So…

375
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,560
you are going to abandon me?

376
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,000
We haven't been married long.

377
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,120
But I'm not blind.

378
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,480
I can see the members of the Li family

379
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,840
hold each other dear

380
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,040
and protect and help each other.

381
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,480
You are inseparable kin.

382
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,600
As the eldest daughter,
you bear even greater responsibility.

383
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,040
If you follow me to the frontier,

384
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,160
it might be bearable
for only three to five years.

385
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,840
But if it's ten or 20 years

386
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,480
without seeing your mother and sisters,

387
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,320
will you truly
have no regrets or resentment?

388
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,800
Rather than a loving couple
eventually turns against each other,

389
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,560
it's better to let you go early.

390
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,840
Once you leave,

391
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,520
the whole world will only curse me

392
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,720
for being a lecher

393
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,240
and abandoning my wife.

394
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,040
No one will absolutely blame you.

395
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,440
My lady? My lady?

396
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,440
My lady, don't go.

397
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,480
- My lady.
- Yangxi?

398
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,400
Shouhua? What happened?

399
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,960
Upon seeing that I've taken two maids,

400
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,440
you've become so jealous.

401
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,000
It shows your narrow-mindedness
and utter foolishness.

402
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,920
It's only a matter of time
before we're enemies.

403
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,200
If you dare to leave today,

404
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,920
don't expect to set a foot back in.

405
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,760
My lady!

406
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,200
Shouhua?

407
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,520
Shouhua?

408
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,960
Madam Du, slow down.

409
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,160
- Shouhua?
- Slow down.

410
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,800
Shouhua?

411
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,720
Shouhua?

412
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,400
- Shouhua?
- Mother.

413
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,680
She is such a filial and virtuous wife.

414
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,640
You couldn't have loved
and respected her enough.

415
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,120
Yet you drove her out?

416
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,040
Hurry and chase her back. Quickly.

417
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,080
If Shouhua doesn't come back,

418
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,800
I'll disown you as my son.

419
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,560
Hurry up and go.

420
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,520
Go quickly.

421
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,000
Hurry up and chase her back.

422
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,800
- Hurry up.
- Madam Du.

423
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,960
The medicine has been reapplied.

424
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,440
Bear with it. It won't hurt anymore.

425
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,240
Stop.

426
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,840
Where are you going
in the middle of the night?

427
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,680
How dare that scoundrel beat Shouhua?

428
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,400
I'll burn his books, smash his house,

429
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,360
and strike him with a rod
to knock him senseless.

430
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,880
After settling scores with him,
I'll go to his office

431
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,240
to catch his meddlesome superior officer
and give him a good beating.

432
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,960
Only then will my resentment be appeased.

433
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,240
Nonsense.

434
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,400
Have you forgotten what you promised me?

435
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,680
Mom, how come even you are afraid
of getting into trouble?

436
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,000
You forbid me of doing anything.
Are you just let him bully Shouhua?

437
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,640
Just look at this.

438
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,400
Look what he has done to Shouhua.

439
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,600
Leshan is young
and doesn't understand reason.

440
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,200
She is easily irritated.

441
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,080
She doesn't know that in this world,

442
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,040
it's like boarding the same boat
for a couple.

443
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,360
They will have

444
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,560
to face winds and waves together
in the future.

445
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,640
I think Yangxi

446
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,400
is not that kind of person.

447
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,120
You must have had a terrible quarrel
that went south.

448
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,760
I will have him
drive those two singers away.

449
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,280
Mom is right.

450
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,080
You married a poor scholar
with a generous dowry,

451
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,440
and you've suffered hardships with him.

452
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,080
Now he's made it
and is moving into a big house soon

453
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,400
where there be crowds of servants.

454
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,560
Shouhua, don't give away
the upcoming wealth and status

455
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,000
and let others enjoy this good fortune.

456
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,800
Wait…

457
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,920
If not for anything else,

458
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,600
I hate that he won't tell me the truth.

459
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,000
Tomorrow morning,

460
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,040
he will definitely come to apologize.

461
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,360
At that time, I'll scold him harshly

462
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,400
and let him personally make amends to you.

463
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,160
Only then will I allow him
to take you back.

464
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,000
Alright?

465
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,840
Shouhua.

466
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,560
Shouhua, what's wrong? Don't scare me.

467
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,040
Mom,

468
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,880
this medicine hurts too much.

469
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,400
If it hurts, it means it works.

470
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,800
Applying medicine always hurts.

471
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,400
I guarantee it won't leave a scar.

472
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,080
Shouhua,

473
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,240
all of us sisters together

474
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,960
are not as eloquent as Kangning.

475
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,600
She can both scold

476
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,200
and coax people when necessary.

477
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,640
I'll immediately send Chunlai
to tell her about what happened

478
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,600
and have her come to keep you company.

479
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,440
Tomorrow, when you see your husband,

480
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,000
we'll make plans then.

481
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,880
Put it down quickly.

482
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,200
Mom,

483
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,200
Shouhua's husband
will come to apologize soon.

484
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,480
If you all play good,
someone has to play bad, right?

485
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,680
I'll squat behind that door in a moment.

486
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,880
As soon as he enters,
I'll nudge him gently like this.

487
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,120
- Is it alright?
- No. Throw it away quickly.

488
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,320
Throw it away.

489
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,760
Hurry.

490
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,080
If you say so.

491
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,680
Just go.

492
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,520
When Shouhua's husband arrives,

493
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,960
I'll teach him a lesson myself.

494
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,760
As long as he's willing to lower his head

495
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,040
and apologize to Shouhua,

496
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,240
this matter will be considered over.

497
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,920
None of you are allowed
to complicate matters. Understood?

498
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,880
Mom!

499
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,040
Mom, we know the severity
and will not hinder Shouhua

500
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,320
from becoming a noble lady.

501
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,120
Do you really think I care

502
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,000
for the so-called title of a noble lady?

503
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,680
Shouhua widowed at a young age.

504
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,760
It's been so difficult
to find her another good match.

505
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,720
Whether her husband can hold office
or achieve glory doesn't really matter.

506
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,280
As long as he can treat Shouhua well,

507
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,560
even if it means having to kowtow to him,

508
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,600
I am willing to do so.

509
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,200
That's why

510
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,200
each of you needs to keep your mouths shut

511
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,640
and not act rashly.

512
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,680
Whoever irritates Shouhua's husband away
will be held accountable by me.

513
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,200
Do you hear me?

514
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,880
- We've heard you.
- Mom, rest assured.

515
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,680
Go ahead.

516
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,840
Master Du?

517
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,120
Mother, Master Du is here.

518
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,760
Mother-in-law.

519
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,520
LETTER OF DIVORCE

520
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,720
What…

521
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,240
When I came to the capital for the exams,

522
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,800
I almost starved and froze
to death on the streets in the winter.

523
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,640
Fortunately, you saved my life

524
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,400
out of compassion.

525
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,960
Your kindness is profound,
like that of a birth parent.

526
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,200
I thought that since I married Shouhua,

527
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,000
I could be by your side

528
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,160
to toil like a beast of burden
and serve you like a servant

529
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,520
to briefly fulfill filial duties.

530
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,840
Unexpectedly,
I don't get along with Shouhua anymore,

531
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,240
and our hearts can't beat as one.

532
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,400
Our vow to grow old together
has become empty talk.

533
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,880
Today, I present a letter of divorce.

534
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,880
I hope you will forgive me.

535
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,400
From hereafter, all the previous
grievances and resentments

536
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,800
between Shouhua and me are gone.
She is free to remarry as she pleases.

537
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,160
And all our ties will be severed.

538
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,360
I only wish that she will
have a new chapter in life,

539
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,760
find another worthy husband,

540
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,640
have another harmonious marriage,

541
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,200
and live happily ever after.

542
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,120
Lingyao.

543
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,560
Here is a casket with a thousand gold.

544
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,680
It can add to the dowry
for Shouhua's new marriage.

545
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,680
For all your kindnesses in the past,

546
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,080
I cannot repay them in this lifetime.

547
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,000
Yangxi, there is no need to do this.

548
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,760
It's just a spat between husband and wife.

549
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,240
It's not to the extent of divorce.

550
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,720
Have you asked your mother?

551
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,680
I don't agree with this.
I think your mother won't agree either.

552
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,320
Master Du,
Shouhua has always been gentle and kind.

553
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,920
She has dutifully honored your mother
and managed the household without fault.

554
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,240
Even the neighbors
never cease to praise her.

555
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,640
Now you have acquired a prestigious post
and a larger house,

556
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,480
and you want to abandon your wife
and remarry.

557
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,040
Won't it damage your reputation?

558
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,200
The name of an ungrateful husband
does not sound good.

559
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,440
Well, you are slapping my family
in the face.

560
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,400
Say no more with him.

561
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,480
We don't care for your money.

562
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,680
The scores between you and Shouhua
are not settled yet.

563
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,320
We'll settle them in the future.

564
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,280
Now, get out of here!

565
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,840
All right. Stop making a scene.

566
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,000
Master Du, Shouhua is right inside.

567
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,640
You two should talk this out properly.

568
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,520
Don't listen to the gossip of others

569
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,600
and ruin your destined good marriage.

570
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,560
Get out! Now!

571
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,120
Both of you are naive.

572
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,480
- Their marriage--
- I've made up my mind.

573
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,480
I will move as soon as noon is over.

574
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,840
The courtyard will return to your family.

575
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,040
From now on, our families
will no longer be related to each other.

576
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
Yangxi.

577
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,800
Can you truly not change your mind?

578
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,200
Good.

579
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,320
Good.

580
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,240
Very good.

581
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,680
You scoundrel!

582
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,480
- Madam Li, stop hitting him.
- You scoundrel!

583
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,320
- It took me a lot to raise Shouhua.
- Madam Li.

584
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,680
How could you trample her,
my precious daughter, like this?

585
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,240
- You think you can treat her like this?
- Let go.

586
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,360
Why are you doing this, you heartless one?

587
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,800
Your career lets you do that?

588
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,640
- I'll beat you, you scoundrel.
- Madam Li!

589
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,240
- He is an ungrateful…
- You scoundrel!

590
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,600
…and shameless person.
Why get angry with him?

591
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,560
- How could you trample her like this?
- Stop. Don't harm your body with anger.

592
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,120
You… How can you be like this?

593
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,120
Madam, Lady Shouhua is crying so sadly.

594
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,200
- You…
- Master, let's go. Just go.

595
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,200
Let's go.

596
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,440
- Let's go.
- You ungrateful scoundrel, scram!

597
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,040
Well…

598
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,120
Let's go.

599
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,640
Let's go quickly, Master,

600
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,760
otherwise, Madam Li will be back.

601
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,120
Let's go, Master.

602
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,360
Let's go.

603
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,520
Master, everything
has been arranged properly,

604
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,520
but your mother refuses to move.

605
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,080
We are taking you to have a better life.

606
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,400
Please just move.

607
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,080
Don't make it difficult for us.

608
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,240
Madam Du?

609
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,040
Mother, I know
that you are used to living here,

610
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,320
but this courtyard is cramped with age,
and the neighbors are noisy.

611
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,880
It's unsuitable for long-term residence.

612
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,840
The new house is spacious and comfortable.

613
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,320
There's also a beautiful garden.

614
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,000
Most importantly, there are people
to take care of you.

615
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,440
Only in that way can I be at ease.

616
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,720
Is my daughter-in-law going as well?

617
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,880
Mother,

618
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,440
I have already divorced Li Shouhua.

619
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,040
She is no longer your daughter-in-law.

620
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,160
She is not someone you could divorce.

621
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,360
Since she married into this family,

622
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,120
she has taken good care
of our food and clothing, and even me.

623
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,080
She is even more filial than you, my son.

624
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,160
You are such an ingrate!

625
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,160
I do not have you as a son.

626
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,760
Give me back my daughter-in-law.

627
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,400
Give me back my good daughter-in-law.

628
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,760
You little beast.

629
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,800
Mother.

630
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,080
This has always been the courtyard
of the Li family.

631
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,960
You can't live here anymore.
You should come with me.

632
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,680
Who says she can't live here?

633
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,040
Madam Du, if I say you can stay,
you can stay.

634
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,920
Sit down first. Slowly.

635
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,640
Madam Du,

636
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,560
you can stay in our courtyard

637
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,640
as long as you want.

638
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,960
If you grow old and are unable to walk
in the future, I will take care of you.

639
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,720
Madam Du, Shouhua is worried about you.

640
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,120
She can't come herself,
so she has sent Mother to see you.

641
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,440
Shouhua…

642
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,520
What did Shouhua say?

643
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,840
Shouhua said

644
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,120
that Madam Du is a person
of principle and grace

645
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,360
and that she can stay
if she doesn't want to go,

646
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,520
so that we will live as we used to.

647
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,480
You go. Go!

648
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,720
I'm not going anywhere. You go.

649
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,080
Mother, since you refuse to come with me,

650
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,320
I dare not go against your wishes.

651
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,600
I will send someone
to deliver clothing, food,

652
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,840
and other daily necessities.

653
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,840
Whenever you have thought it through

654
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,800
and want to move,

655
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,080
I'll come to pick you up personally.

656
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,680
You are so shameless.

657
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,720
Even your own mother won't acknowledge you

658
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,720
for fear her reputation
will be tarnished by you.

659
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,880
This is my family's courtyard.
Unwanted people should scram quickly.

660
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,280
Madam Li,

661
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,360
I really can't face you.

662
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,600
I can't.

663
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,520
Madam Du, please don't say that.

664
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,120
I saw you hit him so hard just now.

665
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,120
Only then did I know
what kind of person you are.

666
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,680
Shouhua is right about you.

667
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,520
You are different from your son.

668
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,440
Madam Du,

669
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,040
just stay here with peace of mind.

670
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,080
Over 20 years of enduring hardships,

671
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,160
I had hoped that he would grow up
and be successful.

672
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,280
Who would have thought

673
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,880
he is also someone

674
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,080
who is ungrateful and disloyal?

675
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,720
He has been so ungrateful.

676
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,880
Yet I still can't bring myself
to reprimand him.

677
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,920
Now he harms others as well as himself.

678
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,400
And it's all my fault.

679
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,920
My lady,

680
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,040
I, Qianniang, am truly sorry.

681
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,240
I'm too ashamed to live anymore.

682
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,040
Today, I will join you in death.

683
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,280
Mother-in-law? Mother-in-law?

684
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,080
Sangma, get some water, quickly.

685
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,080
Being blind,
I couldn't even take my own life.

686
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,360
My lady!

687
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,080
I, Qianniang, have let you down.

688
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,880
I'm truly sorry.

689
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,440
I did not teach the young master well.

690
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,200
I did not teach him well.

691
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,880
You've already done very well.

692
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,160
No one else in this world
has done better than you.

693
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,400
This is not your fault.

694
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,280
Your lady will understand you.

695
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,400
My lady.

696
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,160
Madam Du mentioned
her lady and young master.

697
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,960
How come I don't understand a single word?

698
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,600
You are still well and good.

699
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,640
But Madam Du wanted to commit suicide.

700
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,200
It's so strange.

701
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,920
Yes, indeed.

702
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,680
This matter is indeed quite strange.

703
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,080
The pressing matter
is to invite a physician over

704
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,920
to treat Madam Du first.

705
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,840
- Go ahead.
- Yes.

706
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,960
PAN RESTAURANT

707
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,480
Dear Kangning, please don't cry anymore.

708
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,920
If you keep crying like this,
my heart will break.

709
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,800
That cursed Du Yangxi
has put Shouhua through such torment.

710
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,280
How could he…

711
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,160
What should Shouhua do in the future?

712
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,600
Nonsense. With the two of us here,
Shouhua won't have to worry in the future.

713
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,400
- Stop crying now.
- It's all your fault.

714
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,680
- Don't cry.
- It's all your fault.

715
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,160
Be good.

716
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,080
You brought that disaster upon our family.

717
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,080
How come it's my fault?

718
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,040
Alright, it's my fault.

719
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,160
I should have let him
freeze and starve to death and let…

720
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,400
Now is not the time to be angry.

721
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,480
- I need to go check on Shouhua.
- I'll take you there.

722
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,360
You've always been friends.

723
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,560
If that Du Yangxi comes around
again in the future…

724
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,760
From now on, Du Yangxi is my enemy.

725
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,120
If he dares to come again,
I'll chase him away with a stick.

726
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,480
Good.

727
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,840
