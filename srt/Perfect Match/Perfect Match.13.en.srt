00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,480
EPISODE 13

2
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,840
Lady Kangning left you
on the street halfway.

3
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,320
Master, it was insightful
to tell me to follow you in secret.

4
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,240
Well, the situation
is still manageable to me.

5
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,040
But I'm afraid that scheming Mr. Du
may not have it easy tonight.

6
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,840
Let's go and chase after my wife.

7
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,240
Honey, it's late at night.

8
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,800
Honey,

9
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,280
writing at night is harmful to your eyes.

10
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,480
DIVORCE LETTER

11
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,520
Honey, what do you mean by this?

12
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,840
You seem upset,
and now you want to divorce me.

13
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,640
Are you blaming me for capturing Yan Zimei

14
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,880
and hurting your dignity?

15
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,240
That day, there were
only the two of us in the room.

16
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,640
Others may not be aware,
but you know full well

17
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,440
that I smashed my own ink,

18
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,360
tore up my own old clothes,
and hurt my own dignity.

19
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,760
There were only one
or two excessive remarks.

20
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,120
But they were to win trust.

21
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,680
Honey, considering I've cleared your name,

22
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,440
you should forgive me.

23
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,400
Why are you angry with me instead?

24
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,360
You cleared my name?

25
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,400
Mr. Du, your actions

26
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,080
had three purposes, yet none were for me,

27
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,520
but all for yourself.

28
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,080
I'm all ears.

29
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,040
First, you tested me to see

30
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,320
if I had an affair with Yan Zimei,

31
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,240
tarnishing your family's reputation.

32
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,760
Second, I would be upset

33
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,560
for staying alone till dawn
on our wedding night.

34
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,440
You attempted to use those two slaps
to atone for what you did,

35
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,040
repair the rift, and increase
the affection between you and me.

36
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,840
Third,

37
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,640
you purposely showed off your skills
in front of the Li family

38
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,520
to let them know I have obtained
a capable husband,

39
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,360
making it seemingly reasonable
for me to be more grateful

40
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,000
and obedient to you in the future.

41
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,520
Tell me. Am I wrong about any of these?

42
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,000
It's my fault for failing
to see the real treasure.

43
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,000
Honey, you're the really smart one.

44
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
However, you guessed one thing wrong.

45
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,720
Though I might be incapable, I can
discern people through their writing.

46
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,920
Your handwriting

47
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,360
is elegant and pristine,

48
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,960
with an imposing grace
that bespeaks a master.

49
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,920
It tells me you're not someone indecisive.

50
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,240
I used that fool

51
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,000
only to calm your resentment.

52
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,200
I am several years older than you.

53
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,040
And I was also once a widow. If you have…

54
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,600
I hope you will cherish me.

55
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,000
- You…
- I'll also cherish you more from now on.

56
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,640
Stop that gibberish.

57
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,600
I was wrong.

58
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,040
You treasure books so much
that your room is filled with them,

59
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,440
be it classics, history,
philosophy, and literature.

60
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,040
Go to the shelves
and pick any book to bring over.

61
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,480
Shouhua, do you want to test me?

62
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,640
Who is it?

63
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,080
Coming.

64
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,480
Where are the miscellaneous books
you read?

65
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,160
Not again. A book is a book.

66
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,640
It's not canonical or miscellaneous.

67
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,960
Inside this room, wherever you look,
there are nothing but books.

68
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,080
You can choose…

69
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,280
Didn't you say Tai Xuan Sutra
and Surangama

70
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,440
were unrelated to officialdom,
so you never read them?

71
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,960
Wait. Leave one for me.

72
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,960
You're proficient
in the classics and history

73
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,440
and can memorize anything on sight.

74
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,240
Are you also versed
in Buddhist scriptures?

75
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,760
I am but a slow-witted person.

76
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,280
I've never understood their meanings.
Could you enlighten me?

77
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,600
Buddhism says if the five contemplations
are clear, metal is easily transformed.

78
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,240
But without resolving the three minds,
it's hard to dissolve even water.

79
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,160
What does it mean?

80
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,800
You read the Analects at the age of seven.

81
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,760
You should know the principle of
"reflecting on oneself three times a day."

82
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,960
Even an outsider knows
the importance of self-reflection

83
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,720
and following the path of goodness.

84
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,160
So, when those who practice Buddhism
eat each grain of rice,

85
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,160
they naturally have five contemplations,
always harbor a sense of shame,

86
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,520
and discard the three minds
of greed, anger, and ignorance.

87
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,160
Only with consistent practice
in all actions and rest, can one cultivate

88
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,360
a heart like a bright mirror
that reflects all things,

89
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,480
and achieve a pure world
that liberates all beings.

90
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,880
How come you don't understand

91
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,640
such a simple principle?

92
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,520
- It's her.
- Who?

93
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,560
Li Boyang has Li as a surname,
born with knowledge.

94
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,560
Back then, at the Li family's
literary matchmaking,

95
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,720
the first line of a couplet
that you thought exquisite,

96
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,880
it turns out the person
who set the question was my wife.

97
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,680
Unexpectedly, a marriage by coincidence

98
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,640
resulted in you being married to a lady
of fine character and a pure heart.

99
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,120
Yuanming, your good luck

100
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,240
is truly enviable.

101
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,720
My newlywed good wife

102
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,760
is about to abandon me.

103
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,560
<i>You make a good point.</i>

104
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,880
A noble man is always trying
improve oneself diligently.

105
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,520
It corresponds with Zuo Zhuan's content

106
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,120
about how men are supposed
to establish virtue, deeds, and words.

107
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,240
Those in the world
who die yet never perish

108
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,720
start with diligence
and end with diligence as well.

109
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,760
Andao always keeps
<i>The Book of Changes </i>by his pillow.

110
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,120
If he were here tonight as well,

111
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,880
he would definitely make you
exchange knowledge with him all night.

112
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,800
Alright, I won't continue asking
any further.

113
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm afraid I won't stump you,
no matter what.

114
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,320
Please feel free to speak frankly.

115
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,960
In terms of writing

116
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,720
and governing,
I dare not compare with you.

117
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,240
I'm just devoted to miscellaneous books,

118
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,640
which you might find amusing.

119
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,680
Since you've admitted defeat,

120
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,560
this letter of divorce…

121
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,680
Who says I've admitted defeat?

122
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,800
You are knowledgeable
and are modest about it.

123
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,960
As your husband, I am not an ignoramus

124
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,720
who is unworthy of matching you.

125
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,520
As you know,

126
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,640
I previously had another husband.

127
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,360
After the mourning period was over,

128
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,320
my mother urged me to remarry
over and over.

129
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,840
But I kept delaying my consent.

130
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,240
Do you know why?

131
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,080
Why?

132
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,760
Compared to my late husband, my learning

133
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,440
is like the light of a firefly
outshone by the moon's glow.

134
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,080
Before my late husband passed away,
he held my hand and said,

135
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,840
"If you do not remarry,
I will not rest in peace."

136
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,440
It'd be fine if he only said that.

137
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,600
But he also said that
if I were to remarry,

138
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,160
I must choose a husband
with talent and character

139
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,320
far superior to him.

140
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,680
Otherwise, even across the netherworld,

141
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,960
his spirit would still harbor resentment.

142
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,040
As a woman,

143
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,280
if I cherish the later husband
and forget the earlier

144
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,480
and consider personal feelings
and forget past affection,

145
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,840
it will go against the way
of being a wife.

146
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,680
So, please forgive me.

147
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,360
What are you laughing at?

148
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,280
Are you so certain my talent and character
cannot compare to her late husband?

149
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,840
On his sickbed, he was still thinking

150
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,200
of finding another good husband
for his wife.

151
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,120
He was even willing
to enhance her future dowry

152
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,760
with his heirloom pearl curtain.
Mr. Du, are you that big-hearted?

153
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,360
I'm not.

154
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,560
I'm narrow-minded.

155
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,000
I cannot bear for my beloved wife
to be with someone else.

156
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,640
I would spare no effort to survive
to be with her for life.

157
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,680
I'll never let go of her midway.

158
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,040
He appeared to be big-hearted
on the surface,

159
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,200
but in reality, he made Shouhua
think of him at every turn.

160
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,480
What kind of kindness was that?

161
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,120
He misjudged me.

162
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,120
I will definitely pass my wife's trial.

163
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,680
Then, do you know

164
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,960
what she will test you on,
and how she will test you?

165
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,640
You're asking me?

166
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,880
How would I know?

167
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,200
Fresh pomegranate flowers!
Come and have a look!

168
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,560
Seasonal fruits! Take a look!

169
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,120
Look at these pomegranate flowers.
They're very fresh.

170
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,520
Here. Have a look at these loquats.
What do you think?

171
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,840
- So fresh.
- I like this one.

172
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,920
Mrs. Du is dignified and graceful.

173
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,600
How could there be such a thing?
You must be talking nonsense again.

174
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,360
That person came out of the Li household
in the middle of the night.

175
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,000
I saw it clearly

176
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,760
with my very own eyes.

177
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,200
She has even brought a man to her door.

178
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,560
It's obvious she's not a demure woman.

179
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,600
- This is not good.
- Yes.

180
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,080
She pretends to be chaste and virtuous.

181
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,840
So she is a hypocrite.

182
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,200
Wash them thoroughly. This way,
the pickled plums will be tastier.

183
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,320
Okay.

184
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,720
Mom?

185
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,960
You know what? Speaking
of the background of the Li family,

186
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,480
not one detail can be hidden from me.

187
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,120
Madam Li!

188
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,000
Today, I'm going to let you know

189
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,000
the gossipy ones
will end up with rotten tongues.

190
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,920
You crazy hag!

191
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,080
- Say that again.
- She's hitting me! Help!

192
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,160
That hag has gone mad.

193
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,280
- She's hitting me.
- You deserve it.

194
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,440
- That hag.
- You deserve it.

195
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,720
She deserves it for gossiping.

196
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,360
Exactly. Don't be angry, Madam Li.

197
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,840
Your oldest daughter's character
is praised by everyone.

198
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,080
No one would believe Lady Cui.

199
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,120
Your words are quite odd.

200
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,560
Shouhua seldom goes out,
nor does she meet outsiders.

201
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,160
What do you mean by "praised by everyone"?

202
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,240
- We still have things to do.
- Yes.

203
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,280
Yes, we have to go.

204
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,840
Babblers.

205
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,280
It's said someone
admired Mrs. Du for her talent and beauty

206
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,680
and tried every way to tempt her.

207
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,840
Yet she refused to be tainted

208
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,440
and even had her husband

209
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,960
capture that man.

210
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,320
Now, in Bianjing City,

211
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,280
everyone praises her for being pure,

212
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,800
chaste, and virtuous.

213
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
I remember now too.

214
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,600
So, the gambling game
Suihua set up was for her.

215
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,040
No wonder.

216
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,880
Yuanming, you are here.

217
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,560
Mr. Du has come.
Why didn't you lead him upstairs?

218
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,840
- Let's go.
- Wait.

219
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,000
What gambling game were you talking about?

220
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,000
I know. Come.

221
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,520
Follow me, Yuanming.

222
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,200
- What gambling game was that?
- Let's go.

223
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,160
Let's go up first.

224
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,280
- Let's drink.
- They drank too much.

225
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,240
Let's go.

226
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,960
Chai, please tell me.

227
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,880
What's that gambling game they mentioned?

228
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,320
As you know, the friends I socialize with
are in various trades.

229
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,960
I heard it with my own ears

230
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,320
that someone set up a gambling game
in town to bet on…

231
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,680
Bet on what?

232
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,520
They are just a few lowlifes.

233
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,160
Having failed the imperial exams,
they feel disgruntled.

234
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,800
I don't know where they heard the rumors,
but they dare…

235
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,320
Go ahead.

236
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,280
Yuanming,
don't get hot-headed if I tell you.

237
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,440
- You--
- They bet on Shouhua,

238
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,240
claiming that whoever can win over
the third-ranked scholar's virtuous wife

239
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,040
can win 30 taels of gold.

240
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,040
They bet on my wife?

241
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,360
Gold?

242
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,760
I had no idea I was worth that much.

243
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,040
As soon as Kangning and I heard the news,
we came here to wait for you.

244
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,320
We were afraid that you would hear it
from somewhere else

245
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,560
to add to the annoyance.

246
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,160
It's our fault. We should have been
more careful that night.

247
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,680
There are no walls that don't leak
in this world.

248
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,960
Even if the word has spread,
it's not surprising.

249
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,240
What's surprising
is that others only know of her,

250
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,640
yet the real one at fault
has stayed hidden.

251
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,800
If it isn't Yan Zimei scheming,
who else could it be?

252
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,560
And Lady Cui next door

253
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,920
spends all day prying on us.
She's probably up to no good too.

254
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,760
I reckon she has a hand
in fueling the city's gossip.

255
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,560
Now is not the time
to find out about that.

256
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,560
Those dashing dandies
and frivolous scholars

257
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,920
who love to seek pleasures from women
are all looking for Shouhua right now.

258
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,080
Shouhua, in their eyes, you are a prize

259
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,880
and a piece of mutton
on the chopping board.

260
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
Is it that serious?

261
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,720
Those who flatter you will kill you.

262
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,480
Flattery is followed by
the intent to kill.

263
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,160
Now, everyone is praising Shouhua
for being virtuous and good.

264
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,760
The tide may change abruptly, and everyone
in the city would start trampling on her.

265
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,160
Why are you back?

266
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,200
Hurry back and comfort your wife.

267
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,840
She's a very respectable lady.
She must be frightened now.

268
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,880
Right, you should go quickly.

269
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,400
Yuanming.

270
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,120
If she were an ordinary woman,

271
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,720
when facing such a situation,

272
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,920
she would surely be scared out of her wits
and in utter panic.

273
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,640
But Shouhua
is exceptionally smart and wise.

274
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,880
She definitely has a solution.

275
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,840
If I intervene now,

276
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,200
I would be accused
of showing off my cleverness

277
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,240
and greatly offend her.

278
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,440
So, I cannot go.

279
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,040
How about go
and ask your husband for help?

280
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,320
If you feel embarrassed, I'll go instead.
I fear no embarrassment after all.

281
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,480
We must not ask him for help.

282
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,720
If we only depend on him,
it'll only make him more complacent.

283
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,840
Haode, you can see the long-term.

284
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,320
- Shouhua, I'm worried--
- Without the title of the scholar's wife,

285
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,920
our family's the same as it used to be.

286
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,520
Together as sisters, there's no hurdle
we cannot overcome.

287
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,520
How come each of you
becomes so fragile and dainty

288
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,800
after getting married?

289
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,840
Shouhua has a point.

290
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,520
We can solve the problem
even without Mr. Du's help.

291
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,880
We must let them see our strength.

292
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,800
Alright, we'll all listen to Shouhua.

293
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,680
Right, we'll all listen to Shouhua.

294
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,440
Whatever Shouhua says, we will do.

295
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,440
<i>Those few ruffians and fools.</i>

296
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,760
<i>Given my usual methods,</i>

297
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,400
<i>their limbs should be cut off.</i>

298
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,760
<i>No. That's inappropriate.</i>

299
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,040
<i>With Shouhua's grace and elegance,</i>

300
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,640
<i>she'll deem me too cruel if I do that.</i>

301
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,680
<i>I'm supposed to be the noble</i>
<i>and benevolent third-ranked scholar.</i>

302
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,040
<i>I need to be open-minded and magnanimous.</i>

303
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
<i>Yes, magnanimous.</i>

304
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,840
It's rare to see someone as skilled as you

305
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,120
in writing, painting, embroidery,
and cooking.

306
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,560
In this short period of time,

307
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,640
you've even become good at weaving.

308
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,960
Mother, please don't tease me.

309
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,520
Among my sisters, I am the one
with the clumsiest hands.

310
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,360
I just have a bit more patience
than others.

311
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,200
Then, starting from tomorrow,

312
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,600
I will teach you how to weave plain cloth.

313
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,320
Okay.

314
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,200
<i>She can really sit tight.</i>

315
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,920
<i>Rushing a trade will not make it.</i>

316
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,560
<i>Du Yangxi, you need to be more composed.</i>

317
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,080
<i>Don't present yourself on a platter,</i>
<i>inviting contempt.</i>

318
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,440
Why are you sneaking outside the window…

319
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,560
- What do you want?
- You're asking me?

320
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,400
It's the beginning of the fifth month.
Don't you know what I want?

321
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,560
We pay tribute to first-class
Jinshis and visit the scholars.

322
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,120
Zhang searched but couldn't find you.

323
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,080
He's anxious to the point
of getting mouth sores.

324
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,480
And here you are, idling around.

325
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,400
- Come with me quickly.
- I have something to do.

326
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,040
What could you possibly have to do?

327
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,200
Madam Du,

328
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,720
our madam is sorting out
the summer clothes today.

329
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,480
A robe with peony flowers
cannot be found anywhere.

330
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,000
It was kept by Lady Shouhua earlier.

331
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,760
So, our madam instructed me
to come and ask.

332
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,360
Shouhua?

333
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,480
Isn't that robe the one
Mother loves the most?

334
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,200
It has been well-kept in her room
personally by her.

335
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,000
We looked in all the boxes and cabinets,
but couldn't find it.

336
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,760
And she said she needs to wear it
to visit someone tomorrow.

337
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,120
Right now, she's upset about it.

338
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,920
Your mother is short-tempered.
Don't keep her upset.

339
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,720
Go back and help look for it.

340
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Yes.

341
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
Shouhua, you know what?

342
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Those rumors
have even spread to the Fan family.

343
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,000
We followed your advice to stay put,
but the fire in my heart burns fiercely.

344
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,960
I wish I could deal
with those shameless ones right away.

345
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,440
Forget about letting me wait
another few months.

346
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,840
Even waiting for a day or two
is unbearable for me.

347
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,720
Shouhua, just tell us.

348
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,080
Exactly how long must we wait?

349
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,040
As I've said, it's not time yet.

350
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,120
You don't set foot outside.

351
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,600
No matter how poisonous the rumors,
they can't dirty your ears.

352
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,640
But your husband
has to go out and socialize.

353
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,760
Hasn't he said anything?

354
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,400
He hasn't said nor asked anything.

355
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,200
He really can keep his composure.

356
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,760
I think he is clearly waiting for you
to ask for his help.

357
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,840
- Baked cakes.
- Mom.

358
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,240
- Honey-glazed.
- Just listen.

359
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,560
They are peddling at the door.

360
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,840
I'll go out to buy two baked cakes
and be right back.

361
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,520
- Crispy crust.
- Alright?

362
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,280
They have a honey-glazed, crispy crust.

363
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,200
- No. You can't go.
- Mom!

364
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,040
Last night, I heard you coughing dryly.

365
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,040
Let me go and get you two doses
of decoction to dissolve the phlegm.

366
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,400
- Mom.
- No need.

367
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,240
Let's all just stay put at home.

368
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,560
Qiongnu and Chunlai
are not allowed to go out either.

369
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,000
If you need something,
just have Ms. Liu buy it.

370
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,240
If any of you dare to go out
and make a fuss…

371
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,760
I will break your legs.

372
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,720
Go inside.

373
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,360
Kangning.

374
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,160
Mom, our family is not a noble household.

375
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,560
We don't have that many rules.

376
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,440
Don't restrict them too much.

377
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,880
Exactly.

378
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,400
Shouhua, the time is not right.

379
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,680
If I let them out,
people will say worse things.

380
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,160
Your husband is in official circles.
He needs to keep his reputation.

381
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,400
I don't want to put you
in a difficult position.

382
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,760
Shouhua, look. Mom is now afraid
of both negative and positive remarks.

383
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,680
She startles so easily now.

384
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,000
Mom, please be at ease.

385
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,800
I have my own plan for this matter.

386
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,320
Haode,

387
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,200
my mother-in-law
has been feeling chest tightness recently

388
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,760
and lost her appetite.

389
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,160
Make a trip to the Cao's pharmacy

390
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,960
and get two more doses of Dali pills
so that I can regulate her digestion.

391
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,360
Do you really want me to go?

392
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,160
Can I go too?

393
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,840
Yes. Whoever wants to go can go.

394
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,520
No need to hurry back.
Relax a bit at the marketplace.

395
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,720
The Dragon Boat Festival
is around the corner.

396
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,320
I'll also go out to buy two pieces
of lightweight fabric

397
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
to make a summer outfit
for my mother-in-law.

398
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,120
If it's about connecting with scholars,
does it have to be according to age?

399
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,080
Can't it be based on talent instead?

400
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,560
This is a routine for every session.

401
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,600
But this year, we must come up
with something now.

402
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,960
You are the smartest one.

403
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,200
Let's discuss the protocol.

404
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,400
Don't let the Ministry of Rites' officials
find any faults.

405
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,160
<i>She hasn't even mentioned it to you.</i>
<i>Clearly, you're not on her mind.</i>

406
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,120
<i>Du Yangxi,</i>

407
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,960
<i>she doesn't want your help.</i>

408
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,800
<i>Don't debase yourself.</i>

409
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,400
- Have you found him?
- I've brought him here.

410
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,720
- Where is he?
- Right behind me…

411
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,960
Du Yangxi!

412
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,320
The sachets in the shop
are also embroidered by us.

413
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,480
Do you like them?

414
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,760
- Yes, I do.
- Then, come often from now on.

415
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,000
- I will.
- Okay.

416
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,680
- Please come inside, gentlemen.
- Madam Li.

417
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,520
This way, please.

418
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,680
Order whatever incense you like
or any tea you prefer.

419
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,760
Okay.

420
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,640
Strange, isn't it?

421
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,720
Yes, very strange indeed.

422
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,720
I'm not a stranger.

423
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,120
I'm simply here to drink some tea
and enjoy the view

424
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,600
while I am free.

425
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
There's no need for you
to entertain me personally.

426
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,360
Go ahead with your business.

427
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,760
The rumors about the Li family
are getting pretty loud.

428
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,680
This morning, even my mother
asked me obliquely.

429
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,680
But what's strange

430
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,200
is that the Li family
remains the same as always.

431
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,600
Even Madam Li hasn't frowned once

432
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,160
or sought your help personally.

433
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,960
That is indeed strange.

434
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,000
Since when have you
become a diviner, Chai?

435
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,040
Isn't that obvious?

436
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,720
If she asked you for help,
you wouldn't be eagerly awaiting here.

437
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,280
Yuanming,

438
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,040
do you need me to lend a hand?

439
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,320
Since I said I wouldn't help,
I definitely won't intervene.

440
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,640
So I won't bother you, Chai.

441
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,000
- Isn't that Shouhua?
- My wife?

442
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,480
Where is she?

443
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,280
Mom,

444
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,720
why did Shouhua specifically send me
out of the tea house?

445
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,480
Isn't this ostentatious?

446
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,440
Don't ask too many questions.

447
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,040
Do you remember everything
Shouhua told you when she left?

448
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,680
Of course. I should look around more
and take more strolls.

449
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,240
And if someone talks to me, I'll just…

450
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,200
That's good. Just go.

451
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,360
I'm off then.

452
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,560
I was mistaken.
It was Haode instead.

453
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,920
Yuanming, as someone with experience,

454
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,480
I will kindly remind you

455
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,880
that being a son-in-law
to the Li family is not so easy.

456
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,440
If your wife encounters trouble
and you rush to help,

457
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,680
she may not appreciate it.

458
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,760
The challenge lies

459
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,880
in you needing to help in a way
that is considerate and just right.

460
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,720
Master, the old client
from Xiangzhou has arrived.

461
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,080
You sit here. I'll go and attend to this.

462
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,080
Go ahead.

463
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,800
- Wait. Are you sure…
- No need.

464
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,840
Go ahead.

465
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,080
Master, where should I go?

466
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,840
- Follow Haode.
- Okay.

467
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,520
Li Shouhua,

468
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,840
what exactly is your intent?

469
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,840
Don't miss out as you pass by!

470
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,640
Fresh fish soup! Five coins a bowl!

471
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,480
Young lady, try a bowl of fish soup.

472
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,280
Is it carp soup?

473
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,920
How could that be, young lady?

474
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,840
This is top-quality green fish.

475
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,280
Take a whiff of this aroma
and look at this color.

476
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,800
- Would you like a bowl?
- Yes.

477
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,760
Alright.

478
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,360
Forget it. I don't want it anymore.

479
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,920
Why not? It's only five coins.

480
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,200
I've already scooped the soup.

481
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,720
- I don't want it.
- Just have a bowl.

482
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,880
Three bowls of green fish soup.

483
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,480
- I'll treat this young lady.
- Okay, sir.

484
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,880
Greetings, young lady.

485
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,720
I'm Liu Jing. Sorry for my abruptness.

486
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,360
Please accept my bow in apology.

487
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,440
No need to apologize.
I planned to go home to get some money,

488
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,080
but you came to help me out.

489
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,800
I don't need to tire myself out.
You are truly a kind person.

490
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,880
This tiny favor
is hardly worth mentioning.

491
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,560
I am best at providing timely help.

492
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,680
Please have a look
and see what else you'd like to eat.

493
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,240
This, this, and this.

494
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,240
Sir, are you taking all of these?

495
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,880
Mrs. Du, please look.

496
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,400
This batch is all new stock
that has just arrived at our store.

497
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,280
What inferior goods!

498
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,880
How dare you show them to my lady?

499
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,640
My lady,

500
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,760
I think the Sheng's shop
is nothing special after all.

501
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,000
From now on,
we shouldn't patronize this place.

502
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,920
Let's go.

503
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,240
Young lady, please wait a moment.

504
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,560
Are you blind? An esteemed lady is here.
Quickly bring the first-class items.

505
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,800
Young lady,
a few good items just arrived yesterday.

506
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,240
I haven't shown them
to ordinary customers.

507
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,200
I've been waiting for you

508
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,160
to appreciate them.

509
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,200
How much does it cost?

510
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,440
Four, no, three strings of coins.

511
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,120
Young master, we didn't sell it

512
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,000
to Lady Liu across the street
even at five strings yesterday.

513
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,960
The powder that fell from that shrew

514
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,360
could patch up holes in the wall.
She doesn't deserve this.

515
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,080
The labor cost for this hairpin is huge.

516
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,560
Such fine flowers must be paired
with beauty.

517
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,840
If Mrs. Du desires it,

518
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,640
I would offer it even if I had to pay

519
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,280
out of my own pocket.

520
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,520
Young lady,
it costs three strings of coins.

521
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,560
Go.

522
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,200
We left home in a hurry
and didn't bring enough money with us.

523
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,600
Take these coins as the deposit.

524
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,360
Okay.

525
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,160
My lady, his furtive eyes
are still staring at you.

526
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,800
Sir, please don't sell it to someone else.

527
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,520
I won't. The hairpin is yours now.

528
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,160
I will personally deliver it later.

529
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,120
Young master? Young master?

530
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,600
How can you sell at a loss?
Your father will be hopping mad.

531
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,040
What the heck do you know?

532
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,680
It is only because
of my dashing appearance

533
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,560
that the lady treats me with favor.

534
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,240
The heavens must be in my favor.

535
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,960
It seems like the 30 taels of gold

536
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,720
will be mine.

537
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,840
<i>Previously, I owed you 20 taels.</i>

538
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,400
Before the end of the month,
a total of 25 taels with interest

539
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,840
will be earned
on this third-ranked scholar's wife.

540
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,400
Speaking of four cardinal vices:
wine, women, avarice, and pride,

541
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,320
women should be ranked as the first.

542
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,840
Falling into the trap of gentleness,

543
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,680
even a body of metal
will decay from within.

544
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,800
This is not for fun.

545
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,280
Liang, the lesson
of another one's failure is still there.

546
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,720
A chaste woman must not be defiled.

547
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,800
I advise you not to ask for the beating.

548
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,400
I'm not into women.

549
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,960
I'm only after wealth.

550
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,360
I asked the Liu old lady from their house

551
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,360
to help me accomplish this deed.

552
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,040
I promised her five taels of gold
after the deed was done.

553
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,480
Where will the five taels of gold
come from?

554
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,000
It will come from that bounty.

555
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,880
With her leading the way,

556
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,120
I can enter their house around 12:45
during the Dragon Boat Festival.

557
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,040
Take this.

558
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,600
Make it pretty.

559
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,880
At 12:45 during the Dragon Boat Festival,

560
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,360
I will leave a door open for him

561
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,120
to let him hide in the southeast corner
of the courtyard.

562
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,320
I told him to be there

563
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,440
at that time precisely.

564
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,560
At 12:30 during the Dragon Boat Festival,
at the northwest corner of the courtyard,

565
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,600
there will be old lady and young maid
in the house.

566
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,960
The old uses the toilet,
the young watches the fire.

567
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,560
He is not allowed to alarm any of them.

568
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,680
The call of a cuckoo bird
will be used as the signal.

569
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,920
At 12:45 during the Dragon Boat Festival,
in the northeast corner of the courtyard.

570
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,480
He was told that
we didn't take enough money

571
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,360
and to bring the hairpin here at midnight
for something good would happen.

572
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,200
Having waited so long,

573
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,480
it's finally time
to deal with the culprit.

574
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,880
King of the mountain,
take a look in the mirror.

575
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,000
Leshan!

576
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,000
You're asking for a beating.

577
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,520
- Shouhua, help.
- Slow down.

578
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,800
- Don't run.
- Slow down.

579
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,240
Don't fall.

580
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,320
Stop right there.

581
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,320
- Shouhua, help!
- Slow down!

582
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,040
- Slow down!
- Stop right there!

583
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,680
Catch me if you can.

584
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,360
Stop running.

585
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,200
Stop running.

586
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,240
- Stop!
- Don't fall over.

587
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,160
I caught you. No more running.

588
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,320
Stop running.

589
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,480
- Alright, enough.
- Stop.

590
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,880
SIFU HOUSE

591
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,160
DRAGON BOAT FESTIVAL
FIFTH DAY OF THE FIFTH LUNAR MONTH

592
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,920
Take this.

593
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,520
Done.

594
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,800
Master, forgive my chatter.

595
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,680
You, fellow scholars,
have determined seniority

596
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,920
and paid respects to each other.
Today is the Dragon Boat Festival banquet.

597
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,520
And Master Sang has told me

598
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,720
to constantly remind you
that you must not forget it.

599
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,560
You are tolerated

600
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,840
for the first or second time,

601
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,040
but if there's a third or fourth time,

602
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,920
they will say
you are arrogant and negligent,

603
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,520
- and Master Sang will be mad at you.
- I know.

604
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,080
Have you told my wife
that I won't return tonight?

605
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,680
You must be joking, master.

606
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,840
The Jinshis are holding
a Dragon Boat Festival banquet.

607
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,720
How could the third-ranked scholar
not attend?

608
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,560
Besides, didn't you tell your mother
about it in person a couple of days ago?

609
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,520
Stop the rambling.
I'm asking about my wife.

610
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,800
What's it to do with my mother?

611
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,440
When you spoke back then,

612
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:05,320
your wife was giving your mother
a massage.

613
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,680
So, of course, she heard you too.

614
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,720
Master, it's getting late.

615
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,680
It's time to attend the banquet.

616
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,480
No rush. Let's wait a bit more.

617
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,960
What are you waiting for?

618
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,120
SIFU HOUSE

619
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,920
SEASONAL FLOWERS

620
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,440
Master, shall we go?

621
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,720
Deqing.
Go over those accounts again carefully.

622
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,760
Okay.

623
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,280
Go away.

624
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,520
Yuanming?

625
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,360
Chai, you are here.

626
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,800
Today's the Dragon Boat Festival.
Every household is bustling.

627
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,040
Why aren't you at the scholarly assembly
to drink and recite poetry under the moon?

628
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,040
You're sitting here alone,
facing the chessboard.

629
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,840
Isn't it a waste of a beautiful moment?

630
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,400
Chai, I should be the one asking you.

631
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,280
Aren't you also stationed
at the Pan Restaurant

632
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,920
instead of enjoying the scenic views
at home together with your wife?

633
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,080
It's your fault for neglecting your wife
on no grounds.

634
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,760
Shouhua, finding nothing to do,
invited the sisters for a banquet.

635
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,920
My wife was also invited. With whom
can I enjoy the scenic views?

636
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,880
You mean the Li family
is also hosting a banquet tonight?

637
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,000
The Li sisters often gather.

638
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,720
Playing chess alone
can be terribly boring.

639
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,720
Anyway, I'm free.
How about we play a game?

640
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,960
Yuanming?

641
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,120
Have a seat.

642
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,800
- Whose turn is it?
- Mine.

643
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,160
Cui'er, hurry up.

644
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,960
Escort Fuhui back home.

645
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,280
- Yes, madam.
- She's drunk.

646
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,760
- Mom.
- Quickly. Be careful.

647
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,040
- Be careful.
- Let's drink later.

648
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:48,960
Okay. Alright.

649
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,920
- Be careful.
- Hold her.

650
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,280
Let's drink later.

651
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,680
She can't even walk steadily.

652
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,760
Kangning.

653
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,680
- Time to go.
- Mom, you know I can hold my liquor.

654
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,960
No need to worry about me.

655
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,800
- Just head back.
- Okay.

656
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,160
- Head back now.
- Okay.

657
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,320
- Careful.
- Be careful.

658
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
Hold her.

659
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,920
- Take good care of Kangning.
- Okay.

660
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,840
Fortunately, I had the foresight.

661
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,680
You three have all married close to home.

662
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,600
If you had married far away,

663
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,440
it would be like
cutting out a piece of my heart.

664
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,040
Now that we are well married,

665
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,920
your blessings are yet to come.

666
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,240
There's no need for sighs.

667
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,680
Besides,

668
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,200
I will live close by you,
never far from your side.

669
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,920
- Let's go back.
- I didn't expect

670
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,040
your mother-in-law
to also hold her liquor well.

671
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,440
Now that they've left,

672
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,960
the two of us
can have a few more cups with her

673
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,720
until she's too drunk to return.

674
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,800
Let's go and not drink anymore.

675
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,440
No one's guarding the house at the Du's.

676
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,160
We must be back by midnight.

677
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,560
Why the rush to go back?

678
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,360
That house is so humble.

679
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,520
There is not much for the thieves to take.

680
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,880
Mom.

681
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,400
Yuanming.

682
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,080
Yuanming.

683
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,000
Deqing.

684
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,400
What time is it?

685
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,360
Master, it is close to midnight.

686
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,880
Midnight?
Let's call it for tonight. I'm off.

687
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,480
Deqing, Mr. Du is eager to see his wife.

688
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,200
Prepare a good sedan chair for him now

689
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,200
and escort him home safely.

690
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,320
Okay.

691
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,560
How's that?

692
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,160
Who said I'm going back to see her?

693
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,520
I left my mother at home.
I really can't stop worrying.

694
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,360
Yuanming, you and I have known each other
for quite some time.

695
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,800
No need to pretend in front of me.

696
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,400
If you can't stay here, so be it.
No one is going to laugh at you.

697
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,920
Could it be that my couch has nails in it,
poking you so you can't rest for a moment?

698
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,320
Chai, tell me.
How many rounds have you lost tonight?

699
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,640
I was afraid you'd get annoyed
if you lost too much.

700
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,120
You are so ungrateful.

701
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,960
Come on. Let's continue.

702
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,680
Yuanming, it's my turn.

703
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,480
<i>His appointment was made for 12:45.</i>

704
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,560
<i>I might as well go in first</i>
<i>and use it as leverage.</i>

705
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,280
<i>Fearing I'll make a fuss, that woman</i>
<i>will have to swallow the loss in silence.</i>

706
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,520
<i>I can take advantage of this</i>
<i>and get a token to show off.</i>

707
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,480
<i>Who knows? Maybe the 30 taels</i>
<i>of gold will be mine as well.</i>

708
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,320
What…

709
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,320
Chai, you said earlier
that the Li family is holding a banquet.

710
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,800
- So, Li Fuhui has also returned?
- Of course.

711
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,040
Don't you feel that something
is missing tonight?

712
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,160
Cold moon, mournful wind,

713
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,200
lone chess, bitter tea,

714
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,480
and two men who are fellow sufferers.

715
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,960
What could be possibly missing?

716
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,760
No, it should be three.

717
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,600
- Fan Lianghan.
- Fan Lianghan.

718
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,360
Quickly.

719
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,680
Catch the thieves!

720
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,920
Thieves! Catch the thieves quickly!

721
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,760
Someone, come here quickly!

722
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,760
Hurry, catch the thieves!

723
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,120
- Catch the thieves!
- Go!

724
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,720
Catch the thieves! Someone, come quickly!

725
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,720
Thieves! Catch the thieves quickly!

726
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,920
Here.

727
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,880
- Someone, quickly!
- I'll go first.

728
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,000
Catch the thieves!

729
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,520
Hurry, catch the thieves!

730
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,760
- Thieves? Where are the thieves?
- Catch the thieves!

731
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,440
Catch the thieves. They are right here.

732
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,280
They are there.

733
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,760
Someone! Catch the thieves!

734
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,080
- You darn thieves!
- Stop hitting!

735
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,160
Don't hit me.

736
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,560
- Catch the thieves.
- Hit them.

737
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,520
- They deserved the beating.
- Don't move.

738
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,720
- They deserve it.
- Stay put.

739
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,800
Don't move.

740
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,280
Squat down and don't move.

741
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,480
What's going on here?

742
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,440
Madam Li,

743
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,000
men have entered the Du's house
in the middle of the night.

744
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,600
Aren't you going
to check on Shouhua quickly?

745
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,160
Quickly go in and check.

746
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,560
Find out if she is safe.

747
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,840
Who? Shouhua?

748
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,320
Isn't Shouhua right here?

749
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,720
Shouhua is right here.

750
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,720
Nothing's happened. All is fine.

751
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,240
Today is the Dragon Boat Festival.

752
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,040
I've invited Shouhua's mother-in-law
for a little drink at home.

753
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,920
She got drunk, so I let her stay over.

754
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,680
At night, I couldn't sleep,

755
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,680
so I called my daughters over

756
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,840
to play Ma Diao with me.

757
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,240
Chunlai,
didn't I tell you to lock the gate?

758
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,640
What's with all the commotion now?

759
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,520
I was just about to lock the gate,

760
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,920
but I saw a figure climbing
over the wall. It was so scary.

761
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,040
Fortunately, the neighbors arrived quickly

762
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,200
and didn't let them escape.

763
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,080
- Thanks, everyone.
- Go and check.

764
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,760
See if anything is missing.

765
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,760
I'll go right now.

766
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,520
I'm not a thief. I am--

767
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,240
If you're not a thief, why did you
enter someone's backyard?

768
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,160
Is it because you knew Mr. Du wasn't home
and wanted to insult his family?

769
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,400
No.

770
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,600
It wasn't my intention to come. It was…

771
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,680
What? Someone else invited you here
to join in a game of Ma Diao?

772
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,320
Do you think the charge of adultery
is so easy to fabricate?

773
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,760
If you taint the reputation of the women,

774
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,120
even caning and exile
will be the lighter sentences for you.

775
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,920
You might be sentenced to hanging.

776
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:09,920
Indeed.

777
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,800
If you are really here to lay hands
on the women,

778
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,120
we can't let you off lightly.

779
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,120
They all have slicked hair
and powdered faces.

780
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,440
They're not good people.
We should beat them to death now.

781
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,480
A few days ago,
Mr. Li's youngest daughter went missing.

782
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,520
Perhaps it was these people
who abducted her.

783
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,720
- No, not us.
- These are not petty thieves.

784
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,400
They are clearly a gang of rogues.
They can't be spared.

785
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,560
Why does this person in the middle
look so familiar?

786
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,160
Yes, I am a petty thief.

787
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,040
No. I didn't steal anything.

788
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,080
This is a piece of jewelry from my family.

789
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,800
I sold it at a discount to Mrs. Du.

790
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,600
Then, another lady wanted
to buy for more money.

791
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,280
So, I partnered with them to retrieve it.

792
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,960
We didn't steal.

793
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,200
- Right, we didn't steal.
- You say you didn't steal?

794
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,440
What proof do you have?

795
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,920
How can you prove it?

796
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,800
Look, it's here.

797
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,400
Don't move. Squat down.

798
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,760
We've caught you red-handed.

799
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,680
Yes. Please spare us, young lady.

800
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,640
We've realized our mistake.
Please spare us.

801
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,000
Please spare us.

802
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,440
- We've realized our mistake.
- We really have.

803
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,720
Please spare us.

804
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,280
My lady, except for the two missing
dried fish hanging in the corridor,

805
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,840
nothing else was lost.

806
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,360
Mother, they had ill intentions
from the start.

807
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,000
They should've been sent
for punishment.

808
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,160
However, today
is the Dragon Boat Festival.

809
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,120
It's not good to create killing karma.

810
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,560
Since there is no loss
of property at home,

811
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,360
a lesson taught is enough.

812
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,320
That won't do.

813
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,000
- Mr. Du has returned.
- Mr. Du is back.

814
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,640
- Mr. Du.
- Your home has been burglarized.

815
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,120
- Mr. Du.
- Mr. Du, you've returned just in time.

816
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,240
We'll leave this group of thieves
to you for handling.

817
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,160
Neighbors, I am grateful
for your help tonight.

818
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,320
The thieves will definitely be sent
to the authorities.

819
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,400
Only after they are caned will they
atone for their sins and be better people.

820
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,520
- Wait--
- Neighbors, please,

821
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,200
be witnesses when the time comes.

822
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,400
Sure thing.

823
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,320
- We are neighbors anyway.
- Right.

824
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,960
How about we detain them
for tonight first?

825
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,080
Some of us can take turns
watching over them.

826
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,960
We can take them to the authorities
first thing tomorrow morning.

827
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:03,880
Right. Good idea.

828
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,320
We'll go together to testify tomorrow.
Leave it to me.

829
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,080
- Mr. Du, just trust us.
- Thank you all for your help.

830
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,200
Thank you. Thank you.

831
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,640
- Let's go.
- Get up.

832
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,840
- Get up.
- All of you, get up.

833
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:13,960
Get up now.

834
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,040
- Stop.
- Get up and move.

835
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,800
- Stay put. Don't move around.
- You look like decent people.

836
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,800
Why choose to do wrong
by being a thief? Move.

837
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,440
What a fuss!

838
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,560
- Hurry up.
- Go.

839
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,640
You…

840
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,280
- Unbelievable.
- Yangxi,

841
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,600
your mother has already fallen asleep.
Let's not disturb her any further today.

842
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,200
Rest assured. She's at my place.

843
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,160
I will take good care of her.

844
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,960
You can come to pick her up
tomorrow morning.

845
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,200
Thank you, Mother-in-law.

846
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,240
Thank you, all the sisters-in-law.

847
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,960
Let's go back.

848
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,400
Honey,

849
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,520
you must have been frightened tonight.

850
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,440
Master, your mother is drunk.

851
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,320
She needs someone
to take care of her at night.

852
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,200
I dare not leave her side.

853
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,800
You should go back home and rest early.

854
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,640
Honey.

855
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,360
I've come up with the first question.

856
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,280
Please listen carefully.

857
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,080
Four people compete for the road.
It refers to an old story.

858
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,440
The answer to the riddle
is extremely simple.

859
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,120
I hope you will solve it soon.

860
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,760
