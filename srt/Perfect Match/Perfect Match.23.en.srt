EPISODE 23

2
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,720
Haode, it's not that I don't want to help.

3
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,360
It's just that this case

4
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,000
involves the Qiu, Wu, and Xu families.

5
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,880
It's really a tricky one.
It's not just the three families.

6
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,800
The Wu family's son
is engaged to a girl from the Lu family.

7
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,000
If the Lu family finds out,
they'll surely make a fuss.

8
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,960
Haode, these families
are either wealthy or noble.

9
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,320
We can't afford to get involved.

10
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,160
Mr. Du made judgments based on the law,
and Master Shen concurred with him.

11
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,520
Why go against him unnecessarily?

12
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,600
Kangning,

13
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,880
the Qiu family accuses the son
of the Wu family of adultery.

14
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,800
The Xu's accuse
the Qiu's and Wu's of adultery.

15
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,920
The Lu's will file a lawsuit
of deception in marriage.

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,600
The families are deadlocked.

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,160
You…

18
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,560
After all, you are married off
and no longer have the same heart as us.

19
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,240
They say the vows between men and women
violate marriage laws, and you just nod.

20
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,280
Afraid of her not being chaste enough,
they'd rather force Guiniang to die.

21
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,960
And you are the accomplices of murderers.

22
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,240
Leshan.

23
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,760
Who tipped off Madam Qiu
to catch the adulterers back then?

24
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,800
It couldn't be hidden for long.

25
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,680
It simply got exposed in advance.

26
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,240
Besides, we're trying
to find out a way for her.

27
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,480
Leshan,

28
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,520
this is not our fault.

29
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,080
Who is convicting Guiniang
of an adultery crime?

30
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,120
One of them
is the renowned third-ranked scholar,

31
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,920
and the other is Shen Huizhao,
the Heartless Judge.

32
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,640
We can't outdo them
in either wisdom or tactics.

33
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,360
As for me, I'll just admit defeat.

34
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,560
Go and tell Guiniang
to prepare the rope for hanging herself.

35
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,160
Stop.

36
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,640
What? You've changed your mind?

37
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,480
You've only been married for days,
and you've learned to play tricks.

38
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,720
That's right. She is so mischievous.

39
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,120
She resorts to reverse psychology
when scheming doesn't work.

40
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,640
Shouhua.

41
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,520
I'm begging you.

42
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,080
Please help Guiniang. I'm begging you.

43
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,280
Alright. I will help.

44
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,400
Who gave you the guarantee?

45
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,520
These last few days,
my eyes have also been…

46
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,960
Fuhui.

47
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,520
Second brother-in-law.

48
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,480
What were you doing?

49
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,200
Nothing. I was just looking.

50
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,200
Just looking.

51
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,240
Mr. Shen, please come inside.

52
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,160
Please.

53
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,800
Official Du, Judge Fang said he'd hold
a banquet at the Pan Restaurant for you.

54
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,440
- What act are you playing?
- Mr. Shen, you'll know once inside.

55
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,800
Mr. Shen, don't be anxious.
I've come to bring you news.

56
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,720
- What news?
- You are the last to marry into the Li…

57
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,960
Haode married you last.

58
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,360
You don't know about our secret alliance
of the sons-in-law.

59
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,080
<i>So, they are all the Li family's</i>
<i>sons-in-law.</i>

60
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,760
<i>Except the eldest son-in-law, Du Yangxi,</i>
<i>the one who speaks out of turn</i>

61
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,360
<i>must be the eldest son of the Fan family</i>
<i>that Haode mentioned,</i>

62
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,880
<i>who is Fuhui's husband.</i>

63
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,000
<i>The other one</i>

64
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,440
<i>is naturally Master Chai,</i>
<i>owner of the Pan Restaurant.</i>

65
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,480
Mr. Shen,

66
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,840
we've all heard about the case
of the Qiu family.

67
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,360
Now, Haode has asked
her elder sisters for help.

68
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,000
I wonder if you
have any good strategies to cope with it.

69
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,560
Cope with what?

70
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,240
You have no idea of the energy
of those women together.

71
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,400
They will stir chaos in the entire city.

72
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,360
Okay.

73
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,920
It's alright. No one's here.

74
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,520
Mr. Shen,
you'll understand as time passes.

75
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,400
The young ladies of the Li family
are very difficult to deal with.

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,680
They always try to gain the upper hand
over their husbands.

77
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,880
This time, they intend
to fight for Guiniang

78
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,840
and resist the verdict
of the Kaifeng Court.

79
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,080
This is no joking matter.

80
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,360
They are just some young ladies.

81
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,400
No need for such exaggeration.

82
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,200
It's just a minor case of moral conduct.

83
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,080
I don't know why you are all so concerned.

84
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,720
How the case is judged is not my concern.

85
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,160
But the news
has already reached your ears.

86
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,680
So, if I find myself in trouble,
you must help me as well.

87
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,000
That's the purpose
of the alliance of the sons-in-law.

88
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,520
- Right?
- Yes.

89
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,840
Mr. Shen,

90
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,000
I know that Qiu lady is your cousin.

91
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,600
Do you find it difficult?

92
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,080
If the Qiu lady and the son
of the Wu family are truly in love

93
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,320
and inseparable until death,

94
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,520
the desperate fighting
should've been done earlier.

95
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,640
She should persuade her parents to call
off the betrothal with the Xu's and Lu's

96
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,560
instead of pledging to marry Wu
in a sneaky way.

97
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,520
Now that she's been caught red-handed,

98
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,000
if I spare her,

99
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,120
wouldn't the laws of our country
become a joke?

100
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,520
Mr. Shen, in the court tomorrow,
those women will surely come to pester.

101
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,200
As for me, I can definitely hold steady.

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,440
I hope that you, Mr. Shen,

103
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,840
can hold steady too.

104
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,120
You must not let them coerce you.

105
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,240
This case shall be judged
according to the law.

106
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,200
No one can overturn it
or shake the marital laws of our country.

107
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,880
Mr. Shen,

108
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,320
you can't be so absolute in what you say.
I think we need to think more about it.

109
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,000
If they want to overturn this case,

110
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,640
where would they start?

111
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,520
Her father was so angry that he fell ill.

112
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,320
Had I known this,

113
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,360
I should have let them be together.

114
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,560
It's better than bringing it to the court.

115
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,080
Now, things are out of control.

116
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,520
Your hot temper
has caused so much trouble.

117
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,840
What's the use of regretting it now?

118
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,680
Never mind.

119
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,280
I'll set aside my pride

120
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,240
and go to their doors to mediate for you.

121
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,800
The Xu and Lu families
will definitely not agree.

122
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,520
Good day, Old Lady and Aunt.

123
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,600
Are you here to laugh at me again?

124
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,960
Stop that.

125
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,720
Haode, what's the matter?

126
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,160
Aunt, I'm here to relieve your worries.

127
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,440
Once you're at their homes,
you must absolutely endure.

128
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,600
Only then can you preserve the dignity

129
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,520
of Guiniang and your entire family.

130
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,080
Yes, Mother. I'll keep that in mind.

131
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,760
Old Lady. Aunt.

132
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,760
Where are you two going?

133
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,160
Huizhao, you are back.
The Qiu family has gotten into a lawsuit.

134
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,560
Old Lady is taking Aunt to the temple
to pray for blessings

135
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,520
and ask for a divination lot for Guiniang.
Will you join us?

136
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,160
Old Lady, you just recovered a bit
and shouldn't be overexerting yourself.

137
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,520
Aunt, if you want to go to the temple,

138
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,320
Haode can accompany you.

139
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,520
You simply want Guiniang to be caned.

140
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,240
Even your presence annoys me.

141
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,000
Move. Don't block the way.

142
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,640
Old Lady?

143
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,880
- Old Lady?
- Alas.

144
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,160
Aunt?

145
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,600
Li Haode.

146
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,560
What have you done again?

147
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,600
Guiniang cried so much her tears dried.
I must go comfort her.

148
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,120
I'm leaving, Huizhao.

149
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,720
Even with all your schemes exhausted,
you cannot defy the laws.

150
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,640
Just give up.

151
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,040
Alright, all who should be here
have arrived.

152
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,000
I've investigated

153
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,320
all the details.
Everyone, listen to the verdict.

154
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,080
A rightful marriage should be reached

155
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,000
with the consent of parents, the witness
of the matchmaker, and proper ceremonies.

156
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,680
Wu and Qiu pledge marriage secretly,
abandoning ritual propriety,

157
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,880
without shame, and not according
to marriage laws.

158
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
My Lord,

159
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,640
since ancient times,
there have been many more couples

160
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,240
who came together without those.

161
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,080
Pure quibbling.

162
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,240
Haode,

163
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,080
is this the great plan
you've come up with after an entire day?

164
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,040
I think Mr. Du overestimates you all.

165
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,520
What do you mean by "quibbling"?

166
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,800
Back then, Wenjun ran away with Xiangru.

167
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,280
"The melody of A Pair in Love"
has passed down till now.

168
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,840
Jiao Zhongqing and Liu Lanzhi died
against Jiao's mother's order,

169
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,480
and are celebrated through the ages.

170
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,080
After Zhu Yingtai went to study in Lin'an,

171
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,720
she shared a grave
with Liang Shanbo for eternity.

172
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,680
Prime Minister Xie An inscribed
on their tombstone,

173
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,280
saying Zhu Yingtai was righteous.

174
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,800
Without matchmakers or parental consent,
a couple can still be a tale for all time.

175
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,600
Can marriage laws restrain
the desires of human beings

176
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,000
and the myriad voices
of the people in the world?

177
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,920
The law must also comply
with human sentiments.

178
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,440
Yesterday, Old Lady personally went
to the Wu family

179
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,880
to mediate the marriage
between Guiniang and Wu Xiulin, right?

180
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,560
Although the combinations I spoke of

181
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,760
did not abide by marital laws,

182
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,440
they've become well-known for abiding
by natural laws and human feelings.

183
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,120
Moreover, regarding Mr. Wu and me,

184
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,800
our parents had agreed
to our marriage in the past.

185
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,240
Nonsense.

186
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,560
When did your families ever discuss
a marriage? How come I don't know?

187
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,240
My lord, our families have had
a marriage arrangement of them.

188
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,440
That's right.

189
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,000
Later on, we became enemies,
and the marriage was called off.

190
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,080
By faking a marriage agreement, they'll be
considered faithful to their prior pledge.

191
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,400
The secret affection
can be regarded as loyalty.

192
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,080
Thus, they can be exonerated
of the crime of adultery.

193
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,480
H-How do you know that?

194
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,960
That's a petty trick. Qingshi.

195
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,160
My lord is insightful.
They do want to exonerate themselves.

196
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,560
You claim that the marriage pledge

197
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,120
between you was set earlier
than the ones with the Xu's and Lu's.

198
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,480
Do you have evidence to prove it?

199
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,760
Though our parents changed their minds,
we have remained true to the pledge.

200
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,280
Aside from this paper
of marriage agreement,

201
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,400
we mutually pledged
to each other in marriage

202
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,040
through exchanged poetry

203
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,440
for three years. My lord,
I beg you to see the truth.

204
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,400
A POEM OF LOVE

205
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,200
<i>Be it true or false.</i>

206
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,000
<i>Since the marriage was called off,</i>
<i>you should sever ties completely.</i>

207
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,560
There is no reason
for undue private exchanges.

208
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,240
A few poems are not enough
to persuade Du Yangxi.

209
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,680
You're overestimating yourself.

210
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,120
Even if you're a good match

211
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,880
with a previously set marriage pledge,
you still shouldn't

212
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,440
peek through holes
and climb over walls to meet up, right?

213
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,480
Huizhao, so you're sure that I can't win?

214
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,920
Yes, I'm sure.

215
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,440
<i>In the past, he could remain calm</i>
<i>even as the world crumbled before him.</i>

216
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,640
<i>He was reticent and restrained.</i>

217
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,240
<i>Now, he doesn't remember anything,</i>
<i>but he is better at irritating me.</i>

218
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,960
To win the lawsuit,

219
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,440
we must see through my husband.

220
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,360
He does not love money nor seek profit.

221
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,120
What he loves is talent,
and what he seeks is fame.

222
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,120
Right now, he wants a good lawsuit
to make himself known throughout the land.

223
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,280
What kind of lawsuit
would become the talk of the town

224
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,200
and win him a reputation?

225
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,800
A lawsuit that involves talented people,
romantic love, and an unusual judgment.

226
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,360
If you grasp this point firmly,
you can influence him.

227
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,560
Even if you are insightful,
I have a counter tactic against that.

228
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,480
Did you write the poem?

229
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,320
Yes, my lord.

230
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,720
Guiniang and I have been engaged
since little. Our affection is deep.

231
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,960
Our families became enemies,
and we did not have the elders' blessing.

232
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,320
Yet my resolve is firm. If I can't
fulfill the pledge in this life,

233
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,200
I'd rather remain unmarried forever.

234
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,840
My lord, please see the truth.

235
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,360
A butterfly trapped in a cobweb,
unable to escape.

236
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,160
Can you write a poem for this?

237
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,680
Writing poetry in front of you
is like teaching a fish to swim.

238
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,520
Here is my poem. Due to its wild nature,

239
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,120
it has wandered the garden,
stealing the fragrance.

240
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,320
Now trapped by a cobweb,

241
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,760
it can only be set free
by the third-ranked scholar.

242
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,360
Great.

243
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,720
The last line is simply great.

244
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,520
Today, if I don't make
this beautiful romance come true,

245
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,640
it'll seem that I am too rigid
and lack compassion.

246
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,120
My lord, please hold firm.

247
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,400
I'd like to fulfill your wish,

248
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,400
but this matter also involves
the Xu and Lu families.

249
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,400
My lord, I have ruined the marriage pledge
between the Xu and Qiu families.

250
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,680
I'm truly sorry for that.

251
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,840
I wish to act as a matchmaker
for the Xu and Lu families

252
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,560
to make amends for my wrongdoing.

253
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,080
Good idea.

254
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,160
Our four families
should become sworn relatives.

255
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,840
From now on, we can interact as kin,

256
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,480
renew the friendships between us,

257
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,200
and forget all the grudges.
Isn't that wonderful?

258
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,320
- Well…
- My lord.

259
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,120
Lady Lu and Master Xu Wulang
are waiting outside for your summons.

260
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,040
Their timing is perfect. Let them in.

261
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,080
That's close.
Luckily, they are here in time.

262
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,040
That's a great idea, my lord.
We'll leave it to you to decide.

263
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,920
Wu and Qiu make one pair,
and Xu and Lu make another.

264
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,360
One mismatch by heaven has led
to the creation of two fine couples.

265
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,640
Since all of you intend to make peace,

266
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,040
I will grant your wishes.

267
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,200
Alright.

268
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,280
Later, when you are happily married,

269
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,680
don't forget me as the matchmaker.

270
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,320
My lord, you've made a wise judgment.

271
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,640
My lord, in the court…

272
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,560
I've heard it all.

273
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,320
Huizhao, did you foresee
the matchmaking in the court?

274
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,120
They are willingly withdrawing
the marriage pledges and lawsuit.

275
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,960
This can't be blamed on me, right?

276
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,200
I underestimated you.

277
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,360
My lady, this is the first time
I've seen someone

278
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,200
in this world who dares to oppose my lord.

279
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,520
You are truly audacious.

280
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,240
- Qingshi.
- I'm coming.

281
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,320
So stingy.

282
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,040
Huizhao,

283
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,800
are you really angry?

284
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,400
Huizhao?

285
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,440
You've helped us a lot.
I can't thank you enough.

286
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,480
It seems that you really like
this jade pendant.

287
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,840
Please take it.

288
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,480
Thank you, Lady Qiu.

289
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,240
Thank you, Haode.

290
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,680
Be good. Go ahead.

291
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,280
I've remembered your favor in my heart.

292
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,000
If you come to me seeking help,
I will see to it.

293
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,240
Aunt, I don't want your help on anything.

294
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,720
You may not today,
but you may in the future.

295
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,600
If the ladies
from the other branches bully you

296
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,960
or if Huizhao mistreats you,

297
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,040
I will help you.

298
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,440
Remember, those who treat you badly
are not necessarily evil,

299
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,600
and those who treat you well
are not necessarily good.

300
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,320
Alright, let's go.
I still have things to do.

301
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,280
Madam Qiu's way of expressing gratitude

302
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,200
is truly ingenious and uncommon.

303
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,840
You like it, right?

304
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,800
Haode, do you still remember
why you married into the Shen family?

305
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,560
I…

306
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,440
Do your utmost

307
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,840
to take down Shen Huizhao
and secure the position of his wife.

308
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,760
One can be lost to distractions.

309
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,640
You've buried your head
in the case files all day long.

310
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,040
Knowing your husband is upset,
yet you don't go and coax him.

311
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,160
You're straying too far

312
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,280
and too dull.

313
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,960
Worried about your marriage,

314
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,280
I've grown gray hair at such a young age.

315
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,400
Alright, I know, Mother Leshan.

316
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,800
I'll go coax him right now.

317
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,080
You…

318
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,440
My lord, it's time to take your medicine.

319
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,280
My lord?

320
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,640
Give it to me. You may leave.

321
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,440
Yes.

322
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,440
Huizhao,

323
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,960
if you don't open the door,
I'll go to Old Lady

324
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,840
and let her persuade you
to take your medicine.

325
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,360
Huizhao?

326
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,720
Huizhao, how come
you only caught the medicine and not me?

327
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,240
So, you are not mad at me anymore?

328
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,440
Who said I was mad at you?

329
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,600
Then why do you lock yourself
in the study all day long

330
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,680
without eating, drinking,
or taking your medicine?

331
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,320
Isn't it because you're blaming me
for handling Guiniang's case?

332
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,400
I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at myself.

333
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,080
When our ancestors made laws,

334
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,480
they spared no effort
on considering sentiment and reason.

335
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,600
If a law went against sentiment
or defied reason,

336
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,520
it couldn't be left
for future generations.

337
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,560
What does that mean?

338
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,640
I saw this note when I was browsing.

339
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,760
Although I can't remember at all,

340
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,640
the person who left this note for me

341
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,600
must be very important to me.

342
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,600
He means

343
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,480
that the ones who make the laws

344
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,600
must try their best to take into account
the sentiments and reason of the world.

345
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,960
Laws that contravene those

346
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,080
can't be passed down
to future generations.

347
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,560
Since those who create laws
are sentimental,

348
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,880
how can those who judge
be completely unsentimental?

349
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,440
Laws are supposed to be for the livelihood
and prosperity of the people.

350
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,560
As long as it complies
with the heavens or reason,

351
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,480
what should be supported
must be supported.

352
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,800
It's just that in the past,

353
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,760
I never truly comprehended this note.

354
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,120
This is quite strange.

355
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,040
You didn't understand it
when you were smart,

356
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,440
but now you do when you
become silly after taking a fall.

357
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,560
It's because of you.

358
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,280
Me?

359
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,680
Am I that important?

360
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,960
Thank you for what you did for Guiniang.

361
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,720
- I--
- My lady, Old Lady wants to see you.

362
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,000
- Actually, I--
- Go ahead.

363
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,160
Old Lady, please don't blame me
for being talkative.

364
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,040
Huizhao is the sole heir
of the eldest branch.

365
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,360
He'll inherit the Shen family
in the future.

366
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,320
His wife, however, comes
from a family with no foundation.

367
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,920
She has dull talent and coarse behavior.

368
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,120
She doesn't know how to serve elders
or the etiquette of noble families.

369
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,200
Not to mention the other families
she will socialize with in the future,

370
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,320
even the other branches of the Shen family

371
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,640
laugh at her behind her back.

372
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,200
Then what do you suggest?

373
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,720
To say something improper,

374
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,280
one inevitably seeks any treatment
in desperation.

375
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,520
Luckily, their marriage
has not been widely publicized,

376
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,920
and few in the capital are aware of it.

377
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,720
When they truly consummate
their marriage one day,

378
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,360
it will mean that Huizhao's heart knot
has been untied

379
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,400
and he can totally
marry another noble lady.

380
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,720
As for Li Haode,

381
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,760
with her background and insight,

382
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,200
she can absolutely not be his wife.

383
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,040
Old Lady, Lady Haode is here.

384
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,160
Let her in.

385
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,240
Haode,

386
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,480
what secret are you hiding
that you haven't told me?

387
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,280
<i>Does Old Lady mean Leshan?</i>

388
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,000
Alright, stop hiding it from me.

389
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,440
You go to Huizhao's study every night.

390
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
What do you go there for?

391
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,840
Old Lady, Huizhao hasn't fully recovered
and often feels tired.

392
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,000
But he can't rest easy about work duties,
so he forces himself to attend to them.

393
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,800
But the files are numerous
and seemingly never-ending.

394
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,640
As his wife,

395
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,600
when there is a possibility to help,
how dare I shirk it onto others?

396
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,400
I simply read files
for Huizhao in the study.

397
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,120
I dare not interfere
with official matters.

398
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,040
You are his wife, not his page.

399
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,240
I told you to go to the study room,

400
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,720
not to let you read files for him.

401
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,200
Haode,

402
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,480
do you know why I didn't help you

403
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,880
when those three branches

404
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,000
caused you trouble?

405
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,560
You want to test my composure and conduct.

406
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,800
Haode,

407
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,680
you cannot always avoid.

408
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,960
You must quickly learn
to manage household affairs

409
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,160
and take on the heavy responsibility
of the lady of the house.

410
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,400
Only then will you not let down
my high expectations of you.

411
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,640
Qingshi.

412
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,600
- My lord.
- Hasn't my wife come back yet?

413
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,880
Well… How about I go
and find out some news?

414
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,560
My lord. My lord.

415
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,400
It's so late. Where are you going?

416
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,520
My lord?

417
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,600
Old Lady and Young Master Huizhao
are very frugal in their daily lives.

418
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,680
There don't seem to be many servants
in the mansion.

419
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,680
But considering those nannies, maids,
and servants

420
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,880
from the estates outside,
the number is no less than 200.

421
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,800
The daily expenses
and the reciprocal social exchanges

422
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,480
all need to be recorded item by item
in the account books.

423
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,960
Your ability to tally
and check the accounts

424
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,760
is absolutely indispensable.

425
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,280
Who is outside?

426
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,800
Grandmother, it's me.

427
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,240
I heard that after dusk,
you summoned the housekeeper

428
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,360
and asked for the ledgers
of the past half year.

429
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,120
I feared that you'd stay up all night
checking accounts again,

430
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,600
so I came to take a look.

431
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,000
Are you worried that I can't endure it,
or that she can't?

432
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,640
Grandmother,

433
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,960
these matters can't be rushed.
We can take our time.

434
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,440
Even if I'm healthy now,

435
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,480
I cannot live to be a hundred.

436
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,320
When the day comes that I die,

437
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,080
who will manage
the household affairs for you?

438
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,720
Who will manage our fields and estates?

439
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,960
And who will socialize
with our family's friends?

440
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,400
The Shen family

441
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,480
can't be without a capable lady
to manage the household.

442
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,360
Huizhao,

443
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,960
I'm truly worried about you.

444
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,280
Grandmother,

445
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,760
I've always been independent
in the imperial court,

446
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,960
never seeking to associate
with the powerful officials.

447
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,080
So, my wife naturally

448
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,400
doesn't need to humble herself
to socialize

449
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,160
with the noble families' ladies.

450
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,760
As for the account books,

451
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,480
we can give them
to the trustworthy old housekeeper

452
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,440
to spare us the trouble
over trivial matters.

453
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,360
I've troubled your wife enough.
Take her away.

454
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,800
She's young and naive by nature.

455
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,000
To familiarize her with household affairs,

456
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
it will cost a lot of effort from you.

457
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,120
I'm just worried about you.

458
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,120
Alright, I know.

459
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,640
Just go.

460
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,560
What are you waiting for?

461
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,640
Old Lady, I'll take my leave.

462
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,080
We're leaving.

463
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,560
You may leave. I'll do it myself.

464
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,840
Let's go back.

465
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,200
My lord, Lord Xue
from the Dali Supreme Court has arrived.

466
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,400
Let him in quickly.

467
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,920
Please.

468
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,720
That will do. Be extremely careful.

469
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,320
I was not aware of your visit.
Sorry for not welcoming you in advance.

470
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,480
Mr. Shen, no need for such courtesy.

471
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,800
It is I who have come uninvited
and disturbed you.

472
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,440
Greetings, Mr. Shen. I'm Geng Kaixing.

473
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,600
Lord Xue, please.

474
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,120
Last month, our office
had several criminal affairs

475
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,120
that were jointly adjudicated
with Kaifeng Court.

476
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,560
Due to their significant importance,
I can't fully trust the subordinates,

477
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,960
so I'm here to discuss the matter
of reporting to His Majesty with you.

478
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,280
Official Xue,

479
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,200
don't you have case files
to transfer to Judge Fang?

480
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,200
Go ahead.

481
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,360
Yes.

482
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,600
I wonder which case is so important

483
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,840
to warrant your personal visit.

484
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,640
Is the wound on your head fully healed?

485
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,360
I appreciate your concern.
It's just a superficial wound.

486
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,000
After some rest,
it's no longer a serious issue.

487
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,480
A superficial wound? Back when you
first got involved in criminal justice,

488
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,880
I tested your knowledge.

489
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,000
You answered everything fluently
concerning the laws of recent years,

490
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,760
far surpassing the officials of our office
and the Ministry of Punishments.

491
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,760
As a young man of quick understanding
with an exceptional memory,

492
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,280
why do you resort to this
when you handle cases now?

493
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,280
CATEGORIES OF LAWS

494
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,360
Lord Xue…

495
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,960
You're so confused you can't recognize me,
yet you say it's a superficial wound.

496
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
When you served as the magistrate
of Fengqiu County,

497
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,160
you offended the local powerful houses.

498
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,000
Who pleaded for you in the imperial court?

499
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,760
When you entered Kaifeng Court
to become an official,

500
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,120
who was it that recommended you?

501
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,520
And who is the author
of the inscription in this book?

502
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,840
Jingwei, when we meet in private,

503
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,880
we've always addressed each other
as master and student.

504
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,600
After Geng Kaixing left,

505
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,400
the words you spoke
gave you away immediately.

506
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,120
Master?

507
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,720
You've finally remembered.

508
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,920
- But why would you--
- Why would I suspect you?

509
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,240
You've always supported
using harsh laws to remedy societal ills.

510
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,920
When judging cases,
you only delivered heavy sentences.

511
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,320
But in this past month,
the cases you handled

512
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,640
were sentenced leniently and with mercy.

513
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,440
You thought you had concealed it
tightly without a leak.

514
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,160
But to the observant,
there were flaws everywhere.

515
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,640
How about it?

516
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,200
Having this book with you,
have you gained any insights?

517
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,360
Only now do I understand,

518
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,400
the note you wrote me
was meant to teach me

519
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,000
to discern the ways of the world
and human sentiments when handling cases.

520
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,800
After teaching you for so many years,

521
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,040
I couldn't get through to your blockhead.

522
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,280
I wonder who it was

523
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,840
that changed you,
my disciple with a heart of stone.

524
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,280
ZHENG SU'E

525
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,960
- Let go!
- Let go!

526
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,600
- Let go!
- You condemned prisoner.

527
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,000
- Resisting, aren't you?
- Let go!

528
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,720
How dare you harass a noble lady?

529
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,200
- Drag her away.
- Let go! Let go now!

530
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,440
Let go!

531
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,920
Let go, you condemned prisoner.

532
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,400
- Do you want to die now?
- Haode!

533
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,680
Let go!

534
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,760
- Let go!
- Let go now!

535
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,600
Come here.

536
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,960
Hold her down.

537
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,680
Don't move.

538
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,040
S-S-She has no tongue.

539
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,960
What has happened?

540
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,640
Well, she is a condemned prisoner
being escorted to the capital.

541
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,240
Having just undergone a court session,
she has gone mad suddenly.

542
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,040
My apologies for startling you.

543
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,920
I'm actually accustomed to this.

544
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,640
I'm afraid it may have scared the ladies.

545
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,840
- Drag her away quickly.
- Yes.

546
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,520
Move!

547
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,120
Move!

548
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,480
Jingwei, hurry
and take your wife back home.

549
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,440
My lady, the bathing water
of the Buddha has been spilled.

550
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,080
Let's hurry back.

551
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,720
- Haode.
- Haode?

552
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,840
Huizhao.

553
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,240
Mr. Du, I have a message
from Shouhua for you.

554
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,880
May I have a word in private?

555
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,080
This way, please.

556
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,800
She doesn't have a tongue.

557
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,840
So, she is the one…

558
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,920
- That's scary.
- …who changed your heart, isn't she?

559
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,440
Mountains don't change when it rains.

560
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,520
How could your disciple waver so easily?

561
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,680
Alright.

562
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,880
Let's get back to business.

563
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,480
There is indeed an important case
that I need to discuss with you.

564
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,440
About the Imperial Censorate.
Let's discuss inside.

565
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,960
SHEN'S MANSION

566
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,360
I don't want tea.

567
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,480
Nor do I want medicine. I'm already well.

568
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,440
I made these candied treats personally.

569
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,640
A secret recipe passed down
through generations of Li's.

570
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,120
I used top-quality glutinous rice
to steam honey cakes.

571
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,160
I know you don't like mixed fruits,
so I used apricots instead.

572
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,880
And there are
fragrant dumplings too. Look.

573
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,920
I didn't make them myself.

574
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,520
I bought them from the best confectioner
on Dashitou Alley.

575
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,720
I went there myself. Have a taste.

576
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,640
Speak up. What do you want again?

577
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,760
- The condemned prisoner today…
- Stop.

578
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,400
You can't eat these unless you agree.

579
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,120
Huizhao, just help me out.

580
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,720
Now, whenever I close my eyes,
I see her face.

581
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,960
The cruel official
had her tongue pulled out,

582
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,280
and she can't read.

583
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,400
During today's court session,
she couldn't even say her grievances.

584
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,720
She's truly too pitiable.

585
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,680
The official who cut her tongue
is imprisoned awaiting punishment.

586
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,760
I know.

587
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,080
I heard that her mother-in-law
and her child

588
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,600
have been waiting outside the prison
just to see her once.

589
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,800
Please grant her some mercy.

590
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,440
That child is only four
or five years old now.

591
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,720
If you sentence her mother to death,

592
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,560
it might be the last time
they see each other.

593
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,240
This won't violate any laws, right?

594
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,320
Huizhao, I'm begging you.

595
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,960
Killing one's husband is a grave sin,
among the ten abominations.

596
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,520
- So, my answer is no.
- My lord.

597
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,840
I've brought the new case files.

598
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,280
What are you doing?

599
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,000
If you don't agree, I won't come down.

600
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,120
- My lord?
- If you don't agree, I won't come down.

601
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,880
- I'm coming in now.
- Hurry down now!

602
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,960
- Get out now!
- Yes.

603
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,680
- Leave the files behind.
- Yes.

604
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,600
Alright, get up.

605
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,520
She is about to be executed soon.

606
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,520
Yet you won't even let her
see her family for the last time.

607
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,320
Someone as cold-hearted as you

608
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,280
is not deserving of eating sweet treats.

609
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,680
- I'll eat these myself.
- Half an hour.

610
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,360
What?

611
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,080
Tomorrow, Official Du and I
will inspect the death row cells.

612
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,800
You bring them over.

613
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,400
But you'll only have half an hour.

614
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,960
Enough. Half an hour is enough.

615
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,120
I knew you were the best.

616
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,640
I'll go get you some sweet treats.

617
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,840
Even the weather in June
doesn't change as fast as your face.

618
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,920
KAIFENG COURT'S PRISON

619
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,200
<i>Su'e.</i>

620
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,600
Su'e.

621
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,160
Silly girl, she is your mother.

622
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,760
She is your mother. Hurry.

623
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,360
Su'e.

624
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,680
Her daughter-in-law killed her son.

625
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,480
She doesn't resent her,
but instead has come to see her.

626
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,440
That's really strange.

627
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,600
Call her mother.

628
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,720
During the previous two court sessions,
Zheng did not utter a word in court.

629
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,680
So, the original sentence
was upheld in the end.

630
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,440
Now, the case
has been transferred to Kaifeng.

631
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,120
This is her last chance to survive.

632
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,960
I have interrogated Yang Zigao,

633
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,160
magistrate of Xianping County.
According to him,

634
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,400
once a death row inmate
ultimately gets acquitted,

635
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,120
the original judging officials
will be sentenced to the same punishment.

636
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,200
For that, he cut her tongue.

637
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,600
He even ranted, saying that
it's the usual practice of low officials.

638
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,760
Cruel officials are not rare
in many places.

639
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,240
They would cut out tongues
or poison prisoners to mute them,

640
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,520
making it impossible to seek justice
before the execution,

641
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,440
to avoid repeated inquiries and reports.

642
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,360
She cried for injustice repeatedly,
must have a reason.

643
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,480
But she didn't speak up in the court.

644
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,600
Maybe the person who framed her

645
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,920
is of no ordinary status.

646
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,080
I agree.

647
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,120
But now that she's mute and illiterate,
how can she state her grievances?

648
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,920
My lord, as the poor,
we're struggling to make a living.

649
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,960
With my son gone,
if I lose my daughter-in-law again,

650
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,960
how am I and my granddaughter
supposed to survive?

651
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,880
My lord, please have mercy.

652
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,600
- Please have mercy, my lord.
- Get up.

653
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,400
Granny Zhang, murdering one's husband
is punishable by hanging.

654
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,040
How was the relationship between your son
and his wife in the past?

655
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,760
For what reason
did she murder her husband?

656
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,760
My daughter-in-law has been
in our family for seven years.

657
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,360
The two of them have never had a quarrel

658
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,680
or exchanged a cross word.

659
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,560
A year ago, on the eighth day
of the fourth month,

660
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,120
<i>I returned from offering incense</i>

661
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,360
<i>to find my son had been killed.</i>

662
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,840
Mother.

663
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,720
<i>Later, the officials</i>
<i>arrested my daughter-in-law</i>

664
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,720
<i>and sentenced her to death.</i>

665
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,560
I'm just an old woman.

666
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,560
I have no way to seek justice
for my grievances.

667
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,840
The Zhang family of four
was originally supported by Zhang Min

668
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,520
by cutting wood, making charcoal,
and doing odd jobs.

669
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,920
Later, while he was repairing the roof,

670
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,560
he accidentally fell and broke his leg.

671
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,960
He could only recuperate at home.

672
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,680
To support the family, Zheng Su'e

673
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,360
came to the capital to become a nanny.

674
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,280
A year ago, on the night
of the third day of the fourth month,

675
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,040
Zheng Su'e suddenly returned home
at midnight and refused to go out.

676
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,080
On the eighth day, her husband Zhang Min
was killed with a firewood cleaver.

677
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,240
After the neighbors reported it,
the officials immediately arrested Zheng.

678
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,400
She spoke incoherently in court,
claiming that she killed her own husband,

679
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,040
and was ultimately sentenced to death.

680
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:00,080
After Zheng Su'e came to the capital,
at whose house did she work as a nanny?

681
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,640
According to the broker Xu Er, she was
first hired by the Tians in Jingfufang.

682
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,760
Within a month, she went to work
for the Liu family in Guozi Alley,

683
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,040
mainly doing mending and cleaning.

684
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,720
Xu Er doesn't know
what happened after that.

685
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,240
I've interrogated both families.
Nothing was amiss.

686
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,240
My family once hired such people as well.

687
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,400
Most of the contracts signed
are short-term.

688
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,480
At most half a year,
or as little as one month.

689
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,200
A contract doesn't even need to be signed.

690
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,960
When we're too busy, we'll hire help
for cooking, sewing, and cleaning.

691
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,640
It only costs about
a hundred or so coins per day.

692
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,520
That's true.

693
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,160
Mr. Shen,

694
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,000
do you think the reason
for Zheng Su'e returning home

695
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,520
late at night is related to the case?

696
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,760
She was hired by the Tian family.

697
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,200
Why did she suddenly disappear
in less than a month?

698
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:52,280
The Tian family's matriarch is jealous
and cannot tolerate other women.

699
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,880
Zheng Su'e is good-looking,

700
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,000
unlike a coarse peasant woman.

701
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,560
It may be the root cause of trouble.

702
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,200
Huizhao, your words
are quite unreasonable.

703
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,880
Wealth and beauty have been
deadly temptations since ancient times.

704
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,360
But those who covet wealth and beauty
are not women.

705
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,880
Why blame her without reason?

706
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,640
I had hoped
that you could be fair and just.

707
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,360
Instead, you've started to blame her.

708
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,040
That's not fair at all.

709
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,680
Let's go.

710
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,080
You are speaking up for Zheng.

711
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,680
Then, can you get her to speak?

712
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,360
I…

713
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,520
