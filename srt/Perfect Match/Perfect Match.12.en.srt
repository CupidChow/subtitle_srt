EPISODE 12

2
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,400
My lady, here's the sweet
wheat cake you wanted.

3
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,600
I searched all over the city.

4
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,280
I finally found it
by the Four Kings Temple.

5
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,160
Earlier today, our mother saw
Mr. Du walking into Pan Restaurant,

6
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,960
just steps behind you.

7
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,320
You're not planning a rebellion, are you?

8
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,200
Rebel against whom?

9
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,080
I wouldn't dare go against you, my lady!

10
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,320
My lady, look!

11
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,800
I am afraid that it would get cold,
so I kept it close to my chest.

12
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,520
It's burned me!

13
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,480
My sincerity is evident.
Even Heaven can vouch for me!

14
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,000
Still not telling the truth?

15
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,800
Careful, my lady.
Don't let your anger harm the baby.

16
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,280
They forced me, I swear!

17
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,720
My lady!

18
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,600
My lady!

19
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,200
I share a secret with you.

20
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,600
How will you thank me?

21
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,760
I don't care for your secret.

22
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,760
But this concerns Shouhua's reputation
and the honor of the Li family.

23
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
You don't want to know.

24
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,120
- Really?
- Absolutely true.

25
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,400
Outrageous!

26
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,880
- Shouhua!
- What happened?

27
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,200
Such a hurry to call me back.

28
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,080
Stay outside and don't let anyone in.

29
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,400
Understood.

30
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,760
You two should leave now.

31
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,840
Shouhua, this matter is no trivial thing.
It demands the utmost care.

32
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,280
Shouhua,
do you really know that man named Yan?

33
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,280
Kangning, my conscience is clear.
I have nothing to hide.

34
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,040
Let him investigate.
What do I have to fear?

35
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,440
I appreciate your concern,
but Grandmother can't see,

36
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,120
and she needs someone by her side.

37
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,080
If there's nothing else,
I'll take my leave.

38
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,360
Shouhua!

39
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,400
She speaks with such confidence.

40
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,000
She must have a plan.
Don't lose your composure.

41
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,160
GOLD AND SILVER

42
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,440
GOLD AND SILVER

43
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,720
- Bring it over carefully!
- Got it.

44
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,920
Make way!

45
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,400
Sir, are you looking for some water?
I have some.

46
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,120
Come on in. Follow me.

47
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,280
Oh, no trouble at all, Shouhua.

48
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,800
It's cheaper to buy it on the street.

49
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,360
Madam prefers freshly ground ones herself.

50
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,280
It tastes better
than the diluted stuff outside.

51
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,000
- Let me help.
- No need.

52
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,840
- Wow, you're amazing!
- Great.

53
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,480
Higher, higher!

54
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,280
Higher still!

55
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,320
This is so cool!

56
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,560
Higher, higher!

57
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,320
She is flying now!

58
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,600
So beautiful!

59
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,960
Let's go!

60
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,360
Shouhua,

61
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,160
it's spilling over!

62
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,320
I'll go get the door.

63
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,560
Coming!

64
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,800
You're finally here!

65
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,680
She has been waiting for you.

66
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,960
My lady, greetings and best wishes.

67
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,160
The Liu family, who sell
medicine on Guozi Street,

68
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,000
are looking for a maidservant.

69
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,840
Their lady is unbelievably picky.

70
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,360
Running errands for them
has made my legs as thin as a donkey's!

71
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,320
Ms. Yang,
is it your legs that have thinned

72
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,480
or the donkey's?

73
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Chunlai!

74
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,600
Stop teasing me. Both the donkey's legs

75
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,320
and mine have gotten thinner!

76
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,640
Ms. Yang, come inside to talk.

77
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,640
No rush.

78
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,800
I've already informed
the Chai and Fan families.

79
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,440
No bag is airtight, and news will leak.

80
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,600
No rush, no rush.

81
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,120
My lady!

82
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,160
Sir, you're back! Have you eaten?

83
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,680
Yes, I have.
How is your nighttime coughing, my lady?

84
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,840
I'm taking medicine and coughing less.

85
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,880
Thank you for asking.

86
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,240
My lady,

87
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,520
are we having any guests at home lately?

88
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,240
Back when we first came to the capital,
I only brought two servants.

89
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,320
Ms. Liu often helps out at the shop.
Chunlai served Mother for a long time.

90
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,800
Let her help out at the Du's
for a few days.

91
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,000
Once the middleman finds a kitchen maid,
we can send her back early.

92
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,880
Those middlemen roaming the streets,

93
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,840
talking slick and sharp,
swindle money, and even

94
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,560
sell children and women.

95
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
They're truly despicable.

96
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,760
My lady, you must be extra cautious
about who enters the house.

97
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,800
I understand.

98
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,120
Thank you for your concern.

99
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,320
<i>Three days have passed.</i>

100
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,600
<i>If you truly cared,</i>
<i>you should've told me earlier.</i>

101
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,560
<i>Don't tell me you…</i>

102
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,360
No, no, absolutely not!

103
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,120
It must be that scoundrel
pestering you, my lady.

104
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,960
That's why you couldn't tell me, isn't it?

105
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Yes, yes, exactly.

106
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,600
Calm down.

107
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,760
<i>The shopkeeper said that</i>

108
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,960
<i>Mr. Yan bought a pair of bracelets</i>
<i>meant for a young lady.</i>

109
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,880
<i>Bracelets!</i>

110
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,920
JINSI HALL

111
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,840
Lingyao!

112
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,080
Sir, sir!
That middleman, Ms. Yang, is here again!

113
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,640
- Yuanming!
- She…

114
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,880
- Don't say it.
- Yuanming!

115
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,480
Yuanming!

116
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,000
Look at this thank-you note.

117
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,480
To serve with sincerity and honor,
never straying from my resolve,

118
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,440
or sacrificing oneself for the country,
upholding loyalty until the end.

119
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,720
Which one sounds better?

120
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,440
I think both are good.

121
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,280
You decide among yourselves.
I have something to attend to. Excuse me.

122
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,280
- Lingyao.
- Yuanming, Yuanming!

123
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,040
Chamberlain Wang will be here soon.
Where are you off to now?

124
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,600
Yuanming!

125
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,600
Ms. Yang, take care!

126
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,760
Miss, you should go back.

127
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,800
Stop!

128
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,320
Come here.

129
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,840
Ms. Yang,
why do you run every time you see me?

130
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,800
My poor, failing old eyes
couldn't recognize you.

131
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,080
I heard someone calling behind me

132
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,120
and thought it was Lady Cui next door
coming to collect a debt for her horse.

133
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,760
It scared me half to death.

134
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,320
I've been here many times

135
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,480
but never had the honor
of meeting you before.

136
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,000
You're home early today!

137
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,760
Ms. Yang,
did you find the person I asked for?

138
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,680
I've found her!

139
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,520
She's a maid from the family
of Master Cao, the jewelry merchant.

140
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,280
She's as strong as an ox
and quick with her hands.

141
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,560
Perfect for kitchen work.

142
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,720
It's all set.

143
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,200
I'll bring her over at noon
for my lady to see.

144
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,600
I was just about to visit
the Cao family to inform them.

145
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,880
Please, let go of me!
I'll head to the Cao family now.

146
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,400
What's this?

147
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,240
Sir.

148
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,880
<i>I have no heart for makeup and rouge,</i>

149
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,280
<i>only to find the gold bracelet</i>
<i>loose on my thin wrist.</i>

150
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,360
<i>After we parted, I grew more haggard,</i>

151
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,520
<i>my longing deeper</i>
<i>than words could describe.</i>

152
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,640
This is clearly a woman's poem,
missing her lover.

153
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,640
The gold bracelet loose on my thin wrist.

154
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,280
Gold bracelet.

155
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,840
Oh, what a gold bracelet!

156
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,480
Mr. Du, give it back to me!

157
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,240
- Mr. Du!
- Let go!

158
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,960
Mr. Du, Mr. Du!

159
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,480
Sir, you're back!

160
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,160
Guard the east wing.

161
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,840
- Don't disturb my mother.
- Understood.

162
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,280
Sir, you're here.

163
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,320
What have you done!

164
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,880
What happened?

165
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,800
Well… My lady found the things
in the main hall old and worn.

166
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,120
She had some items brought
from her family home.

167
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,840
But the movers were
careless and broke a vase.

168
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,680
That doesn't sound quite right.

169
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,880
Who would dare deceive you?

170
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,000
Everyone, be careful not
to bump into anything else!

171
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,280
Here, old madam, let me help you inside.

172
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,240
The Li family has pushed me this far.

173
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,200
This is intolerable!

174
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,280
Today, I will divorce my wife!

175
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,200
What happened to his wife?
Everything seemed fine, so why…

176
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,680
- Oh no, oh no!
- What now?

177
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,440
Mr. Du is going to divorce his wife!

178
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,800
Mother!

179
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,400
This, uh… This…

180
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,040
- This, this…
- No, this won't do, Mother!

181
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,560
- How dare he bully my daughter!
- Mother! Mother!

182
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,760
- This will work well.
- You!

183
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,400
If he dares lay a finger on my daughter,
I'll flatten his family grave!

184
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,280
Mother, don't listen to that.
She just wants to stir up trouble!

185
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,040
Mr. Du is about
to be appointed to a position.

186
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,240
Assaulting a government official
is a serious crime.

187
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,920
I'm his mother-in-law!

188
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,880
If you go through with it,
by tomorrow, you won't be anymore.

189
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,640
You have a point.

190
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,320
Let's think of another way.

191
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,080
Why are you giving me this? Take it away.

192
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,000
Having scruples is no fun.

193
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,920
This is lame.

194
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,680
Let's go.

195
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,440
Though Mr. Du
is an arrogant and aloof man,

196
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,840
he wouldn't act without a plan.

197
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
When he passed the imperial exam,
he asked for a divorce

198
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,760
from the daughter of his benefactor.

199
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,440
Even if he doesn't fear being scorned
as an ungrateful scoundrel,

200
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,640
the court censors' brushes
won't spare him either.

201
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,000
He hasn't even received his post yet.

202
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,880
This makes no sense at all.

203
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,400
What on earth is the reason
for this divorce?

204
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,960
Shouhua, just tell us!

205
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,360
He lashed out at me without cause
and called me a fickle woman.

206
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,560
But for what reason?

207
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,240
In all heaven and earth,
only he himself knew it.

208
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,320
I haven't committed any
of the Seven Grounds for Divorce.

209
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,520
There's no reason for this.

210
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,000
Tell him this.

211
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,760
If he can't divorce me,
we'll have to settle for separation.

212
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,480
Go find my brother-in-law
and question him thoroughly.

213
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,440
There's no need to say more.

214
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,480
You saved my life that day, and your
kindness weighs as heavily as Mount Tai.

215
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,320
I will never forget it.
I'll repay this debt in the future.

216
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,040
As for today's rash offense,
I beg for your forgiveness.

217
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,000
The divorce letter
will be delivered another day.

218
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,200
For now, I must take my leave.

219
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,400
Come out, come out!
Quickly, stop your brother-in-law!

220
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,840
Yangxi,
weren't you here to take Shouhua back?

221
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,480
Why are you leaving by yourself?

222
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,040
She won't say anything,
and you refuse to explain.

223
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,120
How can anyone die like this,
not knowing the cause?

224
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,640
Which of the Seven Grounds was violated
to justify this divorce?

225
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,880
Without a clear reason,

226
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,240
my family won't dare
accept the divorce letter.

227
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,000
Brother-in-law!

228
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,000
Newlyweds arguing is perfectly normal.

229
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,720
Why escalate it
to the point of separation?

230
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,400
It'll only invite ridicule.

231
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,040
You're about to take office.

232
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,160
Surely, you should act
with magnanimity and kindness.

233
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,520
Even if Shouhua made a mistake,
for the sake of Mother and us,

234
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,320
we ask for your forgiveness.

235
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,800
Let her correct her ways,
and you can still be a loving couple.

236
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,120
Kangning, that's nonsense.

237
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,560
Shouhua has done nothing wrong!

238
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,680
She's beautiful, gentle, and virtuous,
renowned throughout Luoyang!

239
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,640
If not for observing
mourning rites earlier,

240
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,280
would she have so easily married him?

241
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,840
Well, just because
others call you a third-ranked scholar

242
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,840
doesn't mean I do!

243
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,400
If you push me too far, I'll take your
marriage contract and betrothal gifts,

244
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,160
and we'll see each other at Kaifeng Court.

245
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,800
l accuse you
of climbing the social ladder,

246
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,920
abandoning your wife,
and betraying kindness, unforgivable!

247
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,520
Still dreaming of becoming an official?

248
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,280
Dream on!

249
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,920
Fine, I won't argue with you.

250
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Go get Shouhua here.

251
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,280
Brother-in-law,

252
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,280
Leshan is the wildest
when she's causing trouble.

253
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,320
She doesn't care
how prestigious you are in court

254
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,160
or what rank you'll hold in the future.

255
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,800
Shouhua is so upset, she's fallen ill
and can't get out of bed.

256
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,280
If something truly happens to her, then…

257
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,400
Even though our family is small,

258
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,120
we'll have no choice but to take
this to court to seek justice.

259
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,000
Brother-in-law,
that won't reflect well on you.

260
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,000
Think carefully!

261
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,800
Lingyao, Lingyao!

262
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,080
Sir.

263
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,160
Sir, even I can't
slip away from this mess!

264
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,440
Fuhui,
my marriage with Shouhua isn't harmonious.

265
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,800
The reasons are complicated,
and I'm too ashamed to say them aloud.

266
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,840
Please, ask her yourself.

267
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,280
Who gave her that
embroidered handkerchief,

268
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,960
and who wrote those love poems?

269
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,480
I've asked her directly, but does
she truly have a clear conscience?

270
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,600
Kangning, I may be magnanimous and kind,
but I cannot tolerate dishonesty.

271
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,520
In my family,
we don't accept divided loyalties.

272
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,440
A woman cannot step on two boats.

273
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,720
I cannot comply with your request.
I hope you'll understand.

274
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,320
If Leshan wants to go, let her,

275
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,360
but if you file an accusation in court,
neither family will save face.

276
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,160
Moreover, you risk
being accused of slander.

277
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,040
I fear your frail health
may not endure a few lashes.

278
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,920
You…

279
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,080
- Haode!
- Stop it!

280
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,160
I can't take this anymore.

281
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,480
Mr. Chai!

282
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,120
Mr. Chai!

283
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,760
Yangxi!

284
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,800
- You!
- Go, go, go!

285
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,720
Yangxi!

286
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,520
- Well, don't run so fast!
- Haode!

287
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,120
- Why did you let him get away?
- Yanxi!

288
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,040
- Mother! Mother!
- I didn't let him escape!

289
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,960
Yangxi!

290
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,720
Yangxi!

291
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,880
Yangxi!

292
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,520
Stop running so fast!

293
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,760
Yangxi!

294
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,120
Yangxi!

295
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,400
Yangxi!

296
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,240
Caught you!

297
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,120
Don't worry, Lingyao is clever.
He already led your mother-in-law away.

298
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,240
And you're still
in the mood to joke around?

299
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,520
Those daughters are all formidable.

300
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,960
I barely got away!

301
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,360
It serves you right!

302
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,360
Why on earth are you divorcing your wife

303
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,200
and dragging us into this mess?

304
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,040
My mistake!

305
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,680
I intended to quietly
send her back to her family.

306
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,080
Who knew it'd escalate so quickly?

307
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,160
Mr. Fan,

308
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,320
I fear the Li family won't let this go.

309
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,040
Please, go yourself

310
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,680
to pacify my mother. Tell her…

311
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,120
Tell her I'm at the scholarly assembly
for a few days.

312
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,560
I owe you one. Please, go!

313
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,080
Do you think stirring
a hornet's nest is a good idea?

314
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,800
You're fearless!

315
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,160
Well, he's gone now.

316
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,720
- Time to tell the truth.
- What truth?

317
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,320
I thought you sent
that fool away to talk to me.

318
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,120
It turns out I was overthinking it.
I'm leaving.

319
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,640
Mr. Chai, I was wrong.

320
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,440
I sent him away

321
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,840
because…

322
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,400
I'm an informant!

323
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,800
I knew that Du fellow had ill intentions,
so I planted by his side from the start.

324
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,760
The moment he made a wrong move,
I was ready to report back to my lady.

325
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,120
Among all the Li family's sons-in-law,

326
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,840
they're all pretenders.

327
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,120
Only I am the real deal!

328
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,120
Don't believe me?

329
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,680
He's at the east end
near Sweetwater Alley by Pan Restaurant.

330
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,760
Cousin is there too.

331
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,400
- My husband?
- Kangning, you might not know this yet.

332
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,080
Cousin knows that man plans for divorce,
but refused to let anyone tell you.

333
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,600
He's not just impartial, he's ready to
uphold justice against his own family!

334
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,360
What a heartless man.

335
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,960
Kangning, you should skin him alive.

336
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,440
Enough, enough!

337
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,720
Stop talking so much.

338
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,680
Did Mr. Du say anything else?

339
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,800
No, no,

340
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,480
nothing else.

341
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,600
Then why did you come back?

342
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,480
Go find out more!

343
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,840
Quickly, go!

344
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,040
Fine, fine, I'm going.

345
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,440
Useless!

346
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,840
PAN RESTAURANT

347
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,560
Mr. Chai says he's a fool,

348
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,400
but I don't think so.

349
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,560
This act of playing dumb.

350
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,400
He's probably already sold both of us out.

351
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,560
Expected as much.

352
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,960
Well, I'm also
a son-in-law of the Li family.

353
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,600
Aren't you afraid I'll sell you out too?

354
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,360
A man's knees,
once they bend before a skirt,

355
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,720
there's no hope left for him.

356
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,720
You're known for your righteous

357
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
and chivalrous heart.
I trust you completely.

358
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,080
Besides, so far,

359
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,760
you've only bent one knee.

360
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,040
There's still hope, still hope!

361
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,480
Stop teasing me.

362
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,680
Just say what you want.

363
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,960
Mr. Chai, you're truly perceptive.

364
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,960
I have another important matter
to entrust to you.

365
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,600
Madam, blessings upon you.

366
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,160
I brought a maid from the Cao family

367
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,880
to the Du household's door,

368
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,880
only to be rudely turned away.

369
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,480
When I returned a second time,

370
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,560
they simply said Mr. Du wasn't home.

371
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,840
Hearing that you were here,

372
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,080
I came to pay my respects.

373
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,560
Shouhua. Madam is busy
tending to the shop up front.

374
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,600
Before leaving, she specifically
instructed me to guard the house well.

375
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,920
If she knew…

376
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,240
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

377
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,800
Go stand guard.

378
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,360
This person seems suspicious.
Let's hear what she has to say.

379
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,000
I hired a kitchen maid through you,

380
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,360
and the money was paid in full.

381
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,360
You were generous.

382
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,400
Not a penny short on the deposit.

383
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,760
Since I paid the full amount,

384
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,320
why would you conspire to harm me?

385
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,880
I'm innocent! Truly innocent!

386
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,920
I've worked tirelessly all year round,

387
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,480
finding maids
and renting homes for others,

388
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,600
just to barely make ends meet.

389
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,680
How could I dare offend Mr. Du's wife?

390
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,640
Stop playing both sides with me.

391
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,720
Speak the truth, and I may forgive you.

392
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,920
But if you dare fabricate excuses again,

393
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,840
I'll have you bound
and sent to the authorities.

394
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,880
In court, under harsh interrogation,
you'll have no chance to deny it.

395
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,840
Chunlai!

396
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,600
My lady, don't shout, don't shout!

397
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,880
My lady, it wasn't me
conspiring with others against her.

398
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,720
It was her who was heartless,
causing someone else to suffer.

399
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,480
What nonsense are you spouting?

400
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:30,360
What kind of person is he
to beg me relentlessly?

401
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,600
He only asked me
to deliver an old keepsake.

402
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,880
Seeing such a lovesick fool moved my pity.

403
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,280
She is an upright person.

404
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,920
When I see her, it's like seeing a fairy.

405
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,640
I adore and revere her.

406
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,760
How could I dare relay his words lightly?

407
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,560
Unexpectedly, the handkerchief
ended up in Mr. Du's hands,

408
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,800
causing trouble for her.

409
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,240
So, it was an unintentional mistake.

410
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,880
I don't believe you.
Bring him here to face me.

411
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,760
He regrets implicating her deeply.

412
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,520
If you agree to see him even once,

413
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,280
it'd be like giving him
a new lease on life.

414
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,280
However, your mother is truly formidable,
and she guards the household tightly.

415
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,040
My lady, if your heart is genuine,
why not devise a way to meet him outside?

416
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,840
Clearly, he's a fully capable man,
yet he skulks about like this,

417
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,880
forcing me, a secluded woman,
to venture outside the curtains.

418
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,200
It's not love sickness she has.

419
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,240
More like he's broken
his leg and lost his courage.

420
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,200
Better not to see him.

421
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,720
My lady, don't rush, don't rush!

422
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,320
Look, on the eighth of April,

423
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,280
all the temples hold
the Buddha Bathing Festival.

424
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,960
The Li family will surely
go to pay their respects.

425
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,480
On that day,
find an excuse to stay home alone.

426
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,720
I'll secretly bring him in.

427
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,240
No one will know.

428
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,640
You two can talk inside,
and I'll guard the door.

429
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,720
My lady, you shouldn't
visit the shop these days.

430
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,320
You haven't seen it.

431
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,600
So many people
are all coming to ask Mr. Du

432
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,000
for his calligraphy and paintings.

433
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,480
They bring gold and silver,
flooding the shop with their requests.

434
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,000
It's making Lady Cui
next door green with envy.

435
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,680
<i>Thankfully, the matter of the divorce</i>
<i>hasn't spread yet.</i>

436
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,000
Mother.

437
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,280
Ms. Liu, lately, Shouhua has been uneasy.

438
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,480
I've prepared two pig hearts
in the kitchen.

439
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,640
Go and cook them.

440
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,120
Shouhua, are you really not coming?

441
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,920
Come with us!

442
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,240
The fair outside Xiangguo Temple
for the Buddha Bathing Festival

443
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,560
is lively and bustling!

444
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,280
Alright, alright. Shouhua has a headache.

445
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,800
Let her stay home and rest.

446
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,040
Fuhui, and Kangning
are waiting at Pan Restaurant.

447
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,160
Don't miss the time.

448
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,160
Chunlai,
take good care of Shouhua at home.

449
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,240
Yes.

450
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,200
Mother, take care.

451
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,840
Alright, we're off!

452
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,440
Sir, you're so muddled.

453
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,720
In front of me,
you were as charming as a songbird,

454
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,080
speaking and singing beautifully.

455
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,440
Yet in front of my lady, you fall silent.

456
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,800
Go on and greet her properly!

457
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,920
My lady, I offer you my humble greetings.

458
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,040
Sir. I cannot accept such a greeting.

459
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,600
Don't blame her for being cold-hearted.

460
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,040
That handkerchief caused great trouble.

461
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,880
Who wouldn't be angry?

462
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,480
Pour some wine to apologize,
and then you can talk slowly.

463
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,120
Mother, why leave so soon
after reaching the temple gate?

464
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
Did you forget something?

465
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,240
I'll have someone fetch it.

466
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,760
No need for you to go personally.

467
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,280
Exactly!

468
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,760
The festival hasn't even started.

469
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,240
What's so urgent that you must leave
before seeing the excitement?

470
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,440
Leshan!

471
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,680
My lady.

472
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,680
I just want to ask you.

473
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,040
We were strangers,
with no enmity between us.

474
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,120
Why create trouble
that led to my being divorced?

475
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,720
How can you say we were strangers?
My lady, have you forgotten?

476
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,960
Years ago, I came to your door
to ask your hand in marriage.

477
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,240
So, it really was you.

478
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,920
My lady has a good memory.

479
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,600
That year, I saw you
swinging in the courtyard,

480
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,040
and I lost my heart and soul at once.

481
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,800
I begged my parents
to propose on my behalf.

482
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,840
But we were a step too late.

483
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,160
The Wu family got there first.

484
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,560
That match was made,

485
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,360
but my feelings for you remained.

486
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,480
You haunted my dreams.

487
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,720
I thought it was our fate to part forever.

488
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,080
But then that Wu fellow
turned out to have a short life.

489
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,920
Less than two years later,
he left you behind.

490
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,120
At that time,
my family faced a great upheaval,

491
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,760
and she had to observe mourning rites.

492
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,840
I dared not disturb you.

493
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,720
When I inquired again, the Li family
had already moved to the capital.

494
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,200
After much hardship,
I found my way to your door,

495
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,080
but you were already
promised to someone else.

496
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,320
You're truly a devoted man.

497
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,400
Even so, you shouldn't
have ruined my reputation.

498
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,200
I wasn't trying to harm you, my lady.

499
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,200
I was standing up for you.

500
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,280
That Du fellow,
a poor beggar from a humble background,

501
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,880
relying on his smooth tongue
to climb the social ladder,

502
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,840
is nothing but a petty man
from the streets.

503
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,280
How is he worthy of you?

504
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,400
It is I who am unworthy of Mr. Du.

505
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
My lady, you only know part of the story.

506
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,360
Some top scholars
who pass the imperial exams

507
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,720
rise to high-ranking positions.

508
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,280
Others remain minor officials for decades.

509
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,560
Do you know which one he is?

510
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,680
I fear your efforts
and sacrifices will all be in vain.

511
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,080
I've married him.

512
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,720
Whatever happens is now up to fate.

513
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,080
My lady, you're being foolish.

514
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,240
As soon as you married him,
he stayed at the scholarly assembly,

515
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,200
drinking, feasting,
and composing poetry daily.

516
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,680
When has he ever thought of you?

517
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:08,040
It pains me to see you suffer.
That's why I had the middleman test him.

518
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,480
If he truly cared for you,

519
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,640
he wouldn't neglect
and despise his new bride,

520
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,240
letting you endure ridicule.

521
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:20,280
Nor would he doubt you over a few rumors
and go so far as to divorce you.

522
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,400
He's not reliable.

523
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,960
And you are?

524
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:32,280
My lady, the Yan family is wealthy,
and I am of noble lineage.

525
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,760
I've also passed the imperial exams.

526
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,200
In terms of talent and appearance,
where do I fall short?

527
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,840
Moreover, my feelings for you are sincere.
Heaven and Earth can attest to that.

528
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,280
My lady, please accept me.

529
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,120
Though what you've done was wrong,

530
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,520
I did it out of love.

531
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,360
Alright then, I'll forgive you a little,
just for now.

532
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,920
It's enough if my lady
is willing to pardon me.

533
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,920
Come, please drink this cup,

534
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,760
and let's put
all past grievances behind us.

535
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,360
Not so fast.

536
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,640
I still have

537
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,200
one thing to clarify.

538
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,960
The handkerchief could've been faked,
but what about the bracelet?

539
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,600
My lady, you wouldn't be
trying to trick me, would you?

540
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,760
He's already set on divorcing me.

541
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,000
What reason do I have to deceive you?

542
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,240
You boast of your sincerity and affection,
but it's all lies, isn't it?

543
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,120
My lady, this matter is not so difficult.

544
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,120
The items you usually favor
are all listed at the jewelry shop.

545
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,040
Money can loosen any tongue.

546
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,840
When I saw that Du fellow
move into the court

547
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,680
the day after his wedding,

548
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,960
I suspected there was discord between you.

549
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,280
So, I decided to test him.

550
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,200
That so-called brilliant Mr. Du

551
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,560
is nothing more than a gullible fool.

552
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,360
So, that's how it is.

553
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,800
My lady, please!

554
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,920
There's no use blaming you now.

555
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,080
He's determined
to divorce me no matter what.

556
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,120
So, when will you come to marry me?

557
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,120
I can't stand this.

558
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,600
Fuhui, Kangning, and Qiongnu,
the three of you, go capture him!

559
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,560
Mother, Shouhua isn't like that.

560
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,720
Don't embarrass her.

561
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,880
That's why I told you to see for yourself.

562
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,200
Hurry up.

563
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,800
If one of them got away,

564
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,320
that leaves you to answer for it.

565
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,600
Sit down.

566
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,440
What are you doing here?

567
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,720
My lady, he's inside now.

568
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,920
Did he really go in!

569
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,400
Chunlai, we're back!

570
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,840
Chunlai!

571
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,800
Chunlai, let us in!

572
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,240
It's me! Hurry and open the door!

573
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,640
Chunlai, open up! Let us in!

574
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,560
You two stay here.

575
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,120
- No one goes in or out.
- Understood.

576
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,440
Chunlai, Chunlai!

577
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,200
What? You're already married?
Then why come here and ruin lives?

578
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,840
That marriage
was forced on me by my father.

579
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,040
I wasn't willing.

580
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,240
She's just someone to stay at home.

581
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,600
Once I'm assigned a post,
I'll take you with me.

582
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,000
In faraway lands, you'll be my wife.

583
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,760
My lady!

584
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,080
Shameless!

585
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,680
He's determined to divorce you anyway.

586
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,600
Why not come with me instead?

587
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,360
It's better than enduring scorn
from others.

588
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,040
You've always belonged to me.
Where else could you run?

589
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,640
Slow down! Slow down!

590
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,800
My lady, you're pregnant.
Please be careful.

591
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,000
- Kangning!
- I'm fine.

592
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,520
- You're getting in the way.
- Fuhui, I…

593
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,000
I…

594
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,000
My lady!

595
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,040
My lady!

596
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,560
If I'm unworthy, are you worthy then?

597
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,280
You're worse than a beast
in human clothing!

598
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,480
Tie him up!

599
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,080
You can't do this!

600
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,640
I have scholarly honors!

601
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,920
And yet you know nothing
of propriety, honor, and shame.

602
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,440
How dare you claim to be a scholar?

603
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,640
You've disgraced all learned men.

604
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,760
My lady!

605
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,000
It's too small here. Let's take him
to the main hall for questioning.

606
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,400
Mr. Yan gave me five strings of coins

607
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,000
and promised a bigger reward
once the task was done.

608
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,080
Greedy for money,

609
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,360
I agreed to deliver his message.

610
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,960
I shouldn't have helped
someone seduce Mr. Du's wife.

611
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,240
But my lady's character is so upright.

612
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,120
Nothing could entice her.

613
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,320
When he couldn't have her,

614
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,280
he resorted to this vile scheme.

615
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,440
He spread baseless rumors

616
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,080
to incite Mr. Du to divorce her.

617
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,640
I warned him, doing such a heartless thing

618
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,440
would bring retribution.

619
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,000
He's truly ruthless.

620
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,200
And you're trying
to wash your hands of it?

621
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:31,960
What's this?

622
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,520
Master Chai, have mercy!

623
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,800
He forced me! It was all him!

624
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,360
When you couldn't seduce Shouhua,

625
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,240
you resorted to drugging
this wine in advance.

626
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,920
You planned to knock her unconscious

627
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,600
and carry her away in a sedan chair,
vanishing without a trace.

628
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,720
Then, you'd spread the word

629
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,800
that Shouhua eloped
with someone and vanished.

630
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,840
Mr. Du would be enraged
but unable to make it public,

631
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,440
swallowing his anger in silence.

632
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,200
The Li family would be too ashamed

633
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,240
to investigate further.

634
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,400
- Is this true or not?
- It's true! It's all true!

635
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,880
Master Chai, you're brilliant.

636
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,160
I deserve to die!

637
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,400
I couldn't recognize a true man!

638
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,680
You! You! You all!

639
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,520
It wasn't that we wanted
to hide it from you.

640
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,920
We were afraid the news would leak,
and the fish wouldn't take the bait.

641
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,120
If he'd really carried her off,
it would've been hopeless.

642
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,320
You'd never see her again in this life.

643
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,440
So terrifying!

644
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,200
Pah. So malicious! We should expose him.

645
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,680
Let the whole city know his lies,

646
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,240
so no other women
fall victim to him in the future.

647
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,080
And when did Mr. Du start suspecting me?

648
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,040
From our first meeting!
You were overly eager and attentive.

649
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,440
We had barely met,
yet you spoke deeply and personally.

650
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,280
That made me more suspicious.

651
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,040
And those nonsense stories
of yours are full of holes.

652
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,200
If you truly loved her,

653
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,000
why didn't you openly propose for her hand
and become a proper couple,

654
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,200
instead speaking of secret love?

655
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,760
Didn't you know
you were harmful to her?

656
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,160
You speak up for justice in public
but defy propriety in private.

657
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,360
Your words and actions
contradict each other.

658
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,680
How am I supposed to trust you?

659
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,280
So, that day…

660
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,720
That day, you were all in the house?

661
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,200
The Li family has gone too far
in pushing me.

662
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,840
This is intolerable!

663
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,760
Today, I will divorce my wife!

664
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,600
Cry, cry!

665
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,480
Go ahead and cry!

666
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,640
I should thank my wife
for helping me complete the act with me,

667
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,840
so I could catch you,
the mastermind, red-handed.

668
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,200
Shouhua, did you hear that?

669
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,400
This is the wonderful
son-in-law you've chosen.

670
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,400
So calculating, he'll end up harming
your daughter sooner or later.

671
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,480
Shouhua, did you hear that?

672
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,000
- Guards!
- Shouhua!

673
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,920
Gag him!

674
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,520
Even now, he won't stop sowing discord.

675
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,560
Drag him out!

676
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,800
- Yes!
- Madam!

677
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,200
- Mother.
- Mother.

678
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,520
Alright, alright.

679
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,200
I heard everything outside.

680
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,760
Truly a good son-in-law.

681
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,160
What talent!

682
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,480
So, you've already caught the schemer?

683
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,560
Good. Catching him brings peace of mind.

684
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,040
Madam,

685
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,920
- we must also thank Mr. Chai this time.
- Fuhui.

686
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,200
Another good son-in-law of mine.

687
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,680
Chunlai, tell Madam Liu
to prepare a feast.

688
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,600
Let's celebrate properly.

689
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,640
Yes.

690
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,120
Don't celebrate too soon.

691
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,800
They haven't been sent
to the authorities yet.

692
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,960
Of course,
they'll be sent to the authorities,

693
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,600
but first, we need to consult you.

694
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,120
Why consult?
They should be punished severely!

695
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,560
That's tricky.

696
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,280
The middleman should be

697
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,000
banished from the capital,
never allowed to return.

698
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,240
As for that Yan fellow,

699
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,840
a severe beating
as a small warning will suffice.

700
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,280
Such a scoundrel. Why not arrest him
straight away? Instead, you let him off?

701
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,080
That's also Mother's opinion.

702
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,200
Bringing this to court would
require full disclosure.

703
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,480
He holds scholarly honors,
so detaining him wouldn't be proper.

704
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,440
If he denies everything,

705
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,920
we'd need witnesses to testify by law,
and Shouhua would have to appear in court.

706
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,760
If Mr. Du's wife goes to court,
it'll cause a huge scandal.

707
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,200
Would that benefit her?

708
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,080
And if that scoundrel
spouts more nonsense,

709
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,640
it would be utterly disgraceful.

710
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,040
That would truly let him off lightly.

711
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,360
Don't worry! Big brother-in-law
isn't easy to deal with.

712
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:20,040
He may seem like a frail scholar,
but he's resourceful and composed.

713
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,920
Earlier, didn't he fool all of us?

714
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,800
We really thought
he was going to divorce her!

715
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,640
Shouhua, are you unhappy?

716
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,560
You're talking nonsense again.
Shouhua isn't unhappy.

717
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,080
Her husband is far cleverer than mine.

718
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,200
This afternoon,
look at how ridiculous Fan Lianghan was!

719
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,640
You, you…

720
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,680
- But…
- Haode!

721
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,240
Some seeds!

722
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,480
Leshan, it's late.
Go check if the feast has ended.

723
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,240
Alright.

724
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,720
Fuhui, Fuhui!

725
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,640
Go quickly!

726
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,560
It looks like
your husband got into a fight!

727
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,680
What?

728
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,840
Let's go!

729
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,960
Hey.

730
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,200
This isn't a spectacle for you to watch.

731
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,280
Go play elsewhere!

732
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,480
She's…

733
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,560
- Go play elsewhere!
- I'm not eating.

734
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,920
Brother Fan, we agreed to form
an alliance as sons-in-law.

735
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,760
Yet you turned around
and reported us to your wife!

736
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,000
Weren't you the one
who sold me and Brother Chai out?

737
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,480
You weren't afraid when you tattled.
Now you're scared?

738
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,800
Fan Lianghan, come out!

739
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,760
I won't hit you. Just come out!

740
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,920
I won't! I'm not coming out!

741
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,720
Many men fear their wives,

742
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,000
but your level of fear is one of a kind.

743
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,040
What's wrong with fearing one's wife?

744
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,480
Fearing one's wife is a tradition of
Chinese men, passed down for generations!

745
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,920
It's not fear.

746
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,680
It's respect and love.

747
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,120
Those who mock it,
do they have beautiful, virtuous wives?

748
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,640
They're just jealous, petty people!

749
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,320
- My lady! My lady, save me!
- Come out.

750
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,240
Get up.

751
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,240
- My lady!
- What's wrong?

752
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,600
My lady, save me! Save me!

753
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,440
- What's going on?
- They…

754
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,640
- He…
- We were drinking with him,

755
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,040
and to avoid more drinks,

756
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,360
he crawled under the table.

757
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,120
- Yes, yes!
- Just joking around.

758
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,680
- No!
- Just joking!

759
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,200
I had a bit too much myself,
feeling a little unsteady.

760
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,960
I'll sit down for a while.

761
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,200
Big brother-in-law, don't drink too much!

762
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,320
Shouhua has already had a fright today.

763
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,200
When you take her back,
be sure to comfort her.

764
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,000
Yes, it's late.

765
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,680
We should head home.

766
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,040
The feast ends now.

767
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,680
Thank Fuhui for your concern.

768
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,640
Thank Kangning for the reminder.

769
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,040
Oh, the kidney dish!

770
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,040
My lychee kidney stir-fry
is just off the stove,

771
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,320
and you're leaving already?

772
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,160
Mother, big brother-in-law
should take Shouhua back early.

773
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,960
Alright! Hurry and fetch her.

774
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,760
- Alright, I'll go right away.
- No need!

775
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,240
I'll go myself.

776
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,480
Have one last drink.

777
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,680
Dear.

778
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,640
Sir, there are no blankets
in the carriage.

779
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,160
Don't fall asleep,

780
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,720
or should I help sober you up?

781
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,600
Am I not pressing hard enough?

782
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,960
Murdering your husband?

783
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,040
- Awake?
- I'm awake, I'm awake!

784
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,240
My lady commands.
I wouldn't dare stay asleep.

785
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,560
Why are you scheming behind my back?

786
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,520
You secretly helped
Mr. Du catch the schemer.

787
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,920
Did you inform me beforehand?

788
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,360
My lady, how unfair!

789
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,920
The couple decided together
to set a trap and catch the thief.

790
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,240
I helped out of kindness.
How is that a crime?

791
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,160
If Shouhua had agreed to the plan,
she would've proven her innocence.

792
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,000
If she hesitated,
it would've confirmed her guilt.

793
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,760
What a clever move by Du Yangxi.

794
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,600
He pretended to target Yan Zimei,
but in reality, he was testing Shouhua.

795
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,520
They've been married only a few days.

796
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,720
Not knowing each other
before the wedding is normal.

797
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,320
A groom having doubts isn't surprising.

798
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Besides, if not for Yan's villainy,

799
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,200
how would Shouhua's
spotless reputation be revealed?

800
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:25,240
After this, he should have no doubts left.

801
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,520
And you, my lady,

802
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,160
don't be angry with him.

803
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:36,920
After all, couples like us,
without suspicion and full of affection,

804
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,520
are rare indeed.

805
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,240
Stop the carriage!

806
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,520
My lady!

807
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,960
I'm not angry with him.

808
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,760
I'm angry with you!

809
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,960
You're loyal to Mr. Du.
But I was so upset the whole time.

810
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,840
No, my lady, let me explain.

811
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,800
- Mr. Du. He--
- Get out!

812
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,440
- It was Shouhua!
- Out, out, out!

813
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,600
- Get out quickly!
- It's them.

814
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,080
My lady! My lady!

815
00:46:58,840 --> 00:46:59,680
My lady!

816
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,440
My lady!

817
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,360
I was wrong, my lady!

818
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,560
What are you laughing at?

819
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,440
My lady, my lady!

820
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,040
My lady, I know I was wrong! My lady!

821
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,720
My lady, how heartless you are,
leaving me stranded halfway!

822
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,240
My lady!

823
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,120
