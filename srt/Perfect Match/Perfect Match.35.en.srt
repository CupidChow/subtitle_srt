00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,640
EPISODE 35

2
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,960
Mom.

3
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,360
Come, have some tea.

4
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,400
Calm down.

5
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,440
- Mom.
- Mom.

6
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,720
Mom.

7
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,360
Don't be mad at her.

8
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,400
Shouhua, don't defend her.
She's caused so much trouble.

9
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,320
She deserves it.

10
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,800
I promise, I was going to go,

11
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,040
but the road was really crowded,

12
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,200
and my sedan chair
really couldn't get through.

13
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,240
Mom, I was wrong.

14
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,360
Mom, it won't happen again.

15
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,400
Marriage is so important.

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,240
Look how mad Mom is.

17
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,640
Do you know what husband
she chose for you today?

18
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,320
Mom, what kind of husband
have you chosen for me?

19
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,080
Two caught the embroidered ball.

20
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,880
This first one

21
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,920
is a handsome passing gentleman.

22
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,200
Huizhao thought he looked elegant,

23
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,400
wanting to know more about him.

24
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,080
But that man returned
the ball in public

25
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,960
and said that he's already engaged,

26
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,800
not daring to waste your time.

27
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,120
Your brother-in-law
tried to make him stay,

28
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,720
but he rode his horse and left quickly.

29
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,760
There are two, right?
What about the other one?

30
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,480
Qiongnu, bring it out for her.

31
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,760
The other one is right here.

32
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,720
Well…

33
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,720
Wait.

34
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,640
Neither the handsome guys nor wealthy guys
caught the embroidered ball,

35
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,160
but a pug-dog?

36
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,080
That's a really bad shot.

37
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,520
Madam, do you know who that man is?

38
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,640
Hurry up and tell me.

39
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,280
I can't wait anymore. Tell me now.

40
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,880
Madam, don't be anxious.
He's She Cong,

41
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,080
the eldest of the She family,
arrived from Fuzhou to meet His Majesty.

42
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,080
The She family's been guarding
the northwest for generations,

43
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,760
defending the Song
from the Liao and Xia.

44
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,160
The generals have served
the country for generations.

45
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,320
Their bravery's known
throughout the world.

46
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,840
Among the military families of the Song,

47
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,520
in terms of reputation and prestige,
none can match them.

48
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,200
As for such a family…

49
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,400
Well…

50
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,400
Li Leshan, let me tell you.

51
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,360
Everyone in Bianjing knows you're
selecting a husband based on the game.

52
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,560
Whoever caught the embroidered ball,
he would be your husband.

53
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,760
You can't defy it.

54
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,320
Also, you set this rule yourself.

55
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,800
You must live by it.

56
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,400
If that Mr. She refuses to marry you,

57
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,720
then fine,

58
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,440
you can marry it.

59
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,560
Seriously?

60
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,320
She's such a pretty young lady,
with so many people on the street,

61
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,280
that my brother
caught the embroidered ball.

62
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,480
Then, you have to bring my daughter-in-law
back to let me take a look.

63
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,160
It's just a joke.

64
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,280
Mother, we came to the capital
for official business.

65
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,360
How can you run wild with She Min as well?

66
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,400
It has been days since we arrived,

67
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,360
yet His Majesty has not summoned us yet.

68
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,560
I wonder if there are any changes.

69
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,920
The Linfu Military Bureau was hard on us,
withholding our fees and provisions,

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,120
leading to chaos in the army.

71
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,400
But the Chief of the Military Bureau,
Cui Jizhong,

72
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,000
is the nephew of Minister Cui.

73
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,200
He knows I want to impeach him
in front of His Majesty.

74
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,200
How would Cui Weizhi allow me
to meet His Majesty?

75
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,840
If he pulls a trick, then we couldn't
meet His Majesty ourselves.

76
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,800
Times have changed.

77
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,760
Cui Weizhi is crafty and cunning.
He excels at flattering those above.

78
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,320
Officials who have impeached him
have been demoted one by one.

79
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,840
No one in the imperial court
dares to accept my petition.

80
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,760
I can only seek another way.

81
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,440
Lady She, General.

82
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,200
You asked me
to inquire about the Pan Restaurant.

83
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,640
Mother.

84
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,880
I am just curious

85
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,000
whose young lady

86
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,080
would dare to take my son as her husband.

87
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,240
- Go ahead.
- Yes.

88
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,560
The marriage alliance
isn't for the Chai's, it's the Li's

89
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,360
the tea-selling family
on Pan Restaurant Street.

90
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,760
It's the fifth daughter of their family
seeking marriage.

91
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,400
- What's their surname?
- Li.

92
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,720
- Brother.
- General.

93
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,840
Brother.

94
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,280
Mother, what's wrong with him?

95
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,120
Master, the Li family is right there,
after turning around this alley.

96
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,960
They live in such a place?

97
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,240
Yes.

98
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,720
Leshan, are you really going?

99
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,800
Of course, I must go ask.

100
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,920
Maybe that young general needs a wife.

101
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,040
Enduring northwest hardship
is better than marrying a dog.

102
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,840
Had you known this,
why did you do it in the first place?

103
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,600
So what? Let's go.

104
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,800
- Be careful.
- Yes.

105
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,280
Master, something's wrong.

106
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,080
- Go.
- Yes.

107
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,120
You kidnapped me here?

108
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,520
Lady Li, please calm your anger.
I'm not a villain.

109
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,920
After I took a glimpse of you that day
at the terrace on the Pan Restaurant…

110
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,440
Then you've been thinking about
me every moment.

111
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,640
So, you took the opportunity
to have me carried here,

112
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,520
all to fulfill your infatuation, right?

113
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,760
You are really smart.

114
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,560
All flirts use these lines.
I don't know you.

115
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,480
I am Yingyao, from Quanzhou.

116
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,040
I just moved to Bianjing three days ago
and became your neighbor.

117
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,160
Why did you bring me here?

118
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,760
I heard you are seeking a husband.

119
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,040
If you wish to propose,
you should have sent a matchmaker.

120
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,280
If you are to remarry, of course,
you would go with your heart.

121
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,160
Asking a matchmaker to propose,
I might as well ask for your consent.

122
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,560
How?

123
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,440
I'll offer a thousand gold as betrothal
gift to marry you as my legal wife.

124
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,680
Someone. Bring in my sincerity.

125
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,840
This is the betrothal gift from you?

126
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,240
It's just some small gifts
to express my affection.

127
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,120
It's not the betrothal gift at all.

128
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,840
There are many finer things
in the storeroom.

129
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,160
Please come with me.

130
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,200
Please.

131
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,280
Come on. Put it here.

132
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,040
Wait, the pit is dug too shallow.

133
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,080
- I'll do it.
- Right, put them in order.

134
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,240
I heard this old mansion belonged
to a member of the royal family before.

135
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
After I bought it,

136
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,480
I thought it was overly opulent
but lacked elegance.

137
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,560
So, I had people rebuild the garden,

138
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,080
add some trees and rare flowers,

139
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,480
and make a view with stones

140
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,400
to create a tranquil and natural setting.

141
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,040
If you are willing to marry me,

142
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,920
how about I offer this entire garden
as a betrothal gift to you?

143
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,800
What's going on?

144
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,400
Didn't I tell you to hide when I receive
the important female guest?

145
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,880
I'm sorry

146
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,440
to disturb the guest.
I will have them leave immediately.

147
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,640
Let's go.

148
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,080
Wait. You with the hat, stay.

149
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,080
I heard that your former husband
went to sea before.

150
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,800
I wonder how he compares to me?

151
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,080
He's just a fop. He's either
begging for money in a foreign land

152
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,520
or dead at sea.

153
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,760
Naturally, he couldn't compare to you
in wealth and nobility.

154
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
He's not worth mentioning.

155
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,520
Our family has been
in the shipping business for generations,

156
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,160
dealing with those spices,
precious woods, and ceramics.

157
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,760
We've managed quite well.

158
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
That man

159
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,280
was also going to make a living
by going to sea.

160
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,640
But he gambled with a few ship captains
and lost all his capital.

161
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,120
Now, he can only stay on the ship
and work to pay off his debt.

162
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,280
If your husband were still alive,

163
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,280
he would probably be
just as down and out as him.

164
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,280
How could he deserve you?

165
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,320
What a pity.

166
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,840
This person was from Bianjing too.

167
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,840
He once enjoyed wealth and a merry life.

168
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,480
Unfortunately, indulging in pleasures
made him lose all his family fortune,

169
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,360
his wife,

170
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,560
and his house.

171
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,360
Lady Li, see if you

172
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,520
still recognize him.

173
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,080
No.

174
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,120
Xian, you heard it.

175
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,520
For her, you have been in danger

176
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,200
and risked your life again and again.

177
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,840
But she just remarries.

178
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,080
When she saw these jewels in my hands,

179
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,880
she was really willing
to marry a stranger.

180
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,680
Your husband is right in front of you,
yet you turn a blind eye.

181
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,920
Clearly, she forgets everything
at the sight of money.

182
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,440
She doesn't care about affection.

183
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,360
I think she made up an excuse
to drive you out back then.

184
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,400
And you still trust her?

185
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,000
- Yingyao, shut up.
- No way.

186
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,720
Li Leshan.

187
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,440
Since ancient times,

188
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,280
no matter poor or rich,
one can't change one's principle.

189
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,480
This entire mansion belongs to Xian,

190
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,440
so do the jewels.

191
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,920
If you had waited a couple of days,

192
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,720
you could've enjoyed
this glory and wealth.

193
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,080
But you are unfaithful and ruthless.

194
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,080
Such great wealth now
has nothing to do with you.

195
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,640
How about that?

196
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,880
Are you ashamed?
Do you feel embarrassed to be here?

197
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,640
Stop talking now.

198
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,000
No.

199
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,640
- Leshan.
- Stop her.

200
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,640
- Leshan.
- Do you think you can run away?

201
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,600
I have to humiliate you.

202
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,160
Fine. I didn't bother arguing with you,

203
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,160
yet you're overstepping your bounds.

204
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,800
Why not inquire about the source
of Yang Xian's startup funds?

205
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,920
From my dowry.

206
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,000
He left a letter of divorce,

207
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,760
severing all our ties.

208
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,360
I kept my promise
and waited for him for three years.

209
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,200
Three years.
Even the top scholars' list has changed.

210
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,120
Even if you accuse me to the Yamen,

211
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,440
if the husband does not return
for three years,

212
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,280
it's only right for the wife to remarry.

213
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,840
What's wrong with throwing
the embroidered ball to seek a husband?

214
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,680
Even if I ask all the bachelors
in Bianjing

215
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,560
lined up to be my husband,

216
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,280
it's not your place to scold me.

217
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,760
A girl like you, pretending to be a boy,

218
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,080
helping a man to humiliate me?

219
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,160
Where is your morality and conscience?

220
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,760
Who should be ashamed?

221
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,280
Who should be embarrassed?

222
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,520
Xian, help me.

223
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,200
You brought it upon yourself.

224
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,080
Leshan.

225
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,600
It's all my fault. Don't get mad.

226
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,440
How can you barge in without permission?

227
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,680
This is the Yang's Mansion,

228
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,680
not a place you can just come and go.

229
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,640
This is the Yang's Mansion.

230
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,440
Who are you people?

231
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,120
Li Leshan.

232
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,080
That day I accidentally
caught your embroidered ball,

233
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,440
I saw your sedan chair was being taken,
so I barged in here.

234
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,280
I did not expect that in this house
with a beautiful garden,

235
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,480
there are villains hiding.

236
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,480
Do you need to report it to the Yamen?

237
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,160
Leshan, when I was wandering
and struggling at sea,

238
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,560
my adopted father took care of me.

239
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,680
Before he died, he entrusted her to me.

240
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,280
She has been poorly raised and unruly.

241
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,080
You can hit and scold her.

242
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,720
Please don't be mad at me.
I'm not colluding with her.

243
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,680
I've devoted myself to build this garden,
just to bring you back and please you.

244
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,560
I'm just afraid you're still mad,

245
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,360
so I dare not meet you.

246
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,840
Father, look at him.

247
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,480
With his wife back, he abandons me.

248
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,040
Shut up! It'd be right for
your sister-in-law to beat you to death.

249
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,520
Leshan.

250
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,440
Poo!

251
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,880
You have become quite the wealthy man.

252
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,680
So, now you're putting on airs
in front of me?

253
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,160
Fine, I'll send someone over tomorrow

254
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,520
to settle the principal and interest
you owe me.

255
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,880
Leshan.

256
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,240
Mr. She, how sharp is your sword?

257
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,800
It can cut through iron easily.

258
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,840
Be careful! What are you doing?

259
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,960
Let me see if your hand is injured.

260
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,480
If you don't like this golden rod,

261
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,520
I'll make several new ones for you.

262
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,240
If you're still not mad,

263
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,360
I'll tie her up for you
to vent your anger.

264
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,680
You are sharing the same mind.

265
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,760
If you don't have such intentions,
she wouldn't dare to say so.

266
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,920
You think the Li family is waiting
for a better offer, right?

267
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,440
Well, that's not entirely wrong.

268
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,880
I must marry into the best family.

269
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,680
Go ahead and be wealthy.

270
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,720
I have my pride.

271
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,520
Even if I am reduced to poverty,
I will never kneel before you.

272
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,120
Leshan.

273
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,600
Didn't you hear what she said?

274
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,120
Stay far away from her.

275
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,320
Otherwise, I'll never spare you.

276
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,120
Master.

277
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,120
Xian.

278
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,880
Master, he's so ruthless.

279
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,840
Are you alright?

280
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,160
MOON SHINING BRIGHTLY

281
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,360
Are you happy now?

282
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,320
I didn't know she's like that.

283
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,320
You said

284
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,000
sister-in-law is so virtuous and gentle
that no one can compete.

285
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,120
You lied to me.

286
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,600
I left her for three years.

287
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,160
And I'm so regretful.

288
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,880
I was afraid she'd remarry,
so I didn't even dare to ask.

289
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,960
Yet you had the nerve to test her.
If it weren't for adopted father,

290
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,440
I would starve you for three days.

291
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,360
Then I will go beg
for her forgiveness sincerely.

292
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,560
If she does not forgive me, I will kneel
and never get up. Is that okay?

293
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,040
I'm afraid even if you hang yourself
at the Li's house's gate,

294
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,800
she wouldn't spare you a glance.

295
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,000
If I got abandoned,

296
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,720
I must beat you to death.

297
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,760
They brought me here and asked me to wait.

298
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,880
I was afraid you'd get in trouble,
so I didn't leave.

299
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,680
Fortunately, you are fine.
Otherwise, I don't dare to go back.

300
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,440
Let's go.

301
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,240
Hurry, let's go.

302
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,960
Hold on.

303
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
Lady Li, who did you expect to come?

304
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,040
Mr. She, thank you for helping me.

305
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,160
I'll tell my mother about this and then
we'll come to express my gratitude.

306
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,120
Leshan, do you still remember me?

307
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
Mom.

308
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,920
Do you really intend to marry Leshan
to that military officer?

309
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,240
It depends on
if he's willing to marry her.

310
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,280
Fuzhou is so far away from Bianjing.

311
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,520
And the She family is known
for its loyalty and valor,

312
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,440
carrying a heavy burden.

313
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,520
Not to mention
the mismatch in family status,

314
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,320
being a lady of a prestige family
is not an easy task.

315
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,160
What a joke.

316
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,920
She will come to her senses
and decide to marry into the Chen family.

317
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,320
I knew you were up to tricks.

318
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,200
I must marry that man named She.

319
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,400
I have brought him back.

320
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,800
Who is it?

321
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,720
Mr. She.

322
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,640
Come in, please.

323
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,600
You are from a loyal and righteous family,

324
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,720
while you don't know any etiquette at all.

325
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,680
What place is this?

326
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,320
All the ladies of my family are present.

327
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,080
You can't just come and go as you want.

328
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,760
Mom, it's our brother.

329
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,360
It's our brother.

330
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,800
Kangning.

331
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,920
It's our brother.

332
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,280
- Mom.
- Mom.

333
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,200
That year,

334
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,520
I was swept far away by the river.

335
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,360
It was Lady She who passed by and saved me

336
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,960
and took me all the way back to Fuzhou.

337
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,400
When I woke up,

338
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,240
my head was muddled,
and I couldn't remember my own name.

339
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,840
Lady She said
I am the eldest son of the She family,

340
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,480
who'd been living with my grandparents
in Luoyang since childhood.

341
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,880
And she said on the way back to Fuzhou,

342
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,800
I accidentally fell into the river.

343
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,160
I have never doubted it.

344
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,080
Child.

345
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,000
Lady She, I found a child by the river.
He's still alive.

346
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,160
- Save him.
- Yes.

347
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,880
At that time, Mom thought
you died in the water

348
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,200
and shed tears all day long.

349
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,920
The Li clan, convinced of no sons
in our family, consistently troubled us.

350
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,480
How could she take someone else's son?

351
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,040
Then, why would she
acknowledge you as her son?

352
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,400
The She family rose to prominence
since the end of the Tang,

353
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,080
guarding the northwest for generations.

354
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,880
The young and strong men of the She clan

355
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,040
all died on the frontier.

356
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,920
For three generations in a row,
there was no one who lived past 40.

357
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,840
The She family
used their loyalty and lives

358
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,320
for the highest honors
from the founding emperor,

359
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,440
so they could inherit the position
of Fuzhou governor.

360
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,840
Yet surrounded by formidable enemies
and fraught with internal contradictions,

361
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,480
if the She family had no legitimate heir,

362
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,440
the hereditary position
of the Fuzhou governor and military power

363
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,840
could not be passed on.

364
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,240
In order to keep her eldest son safe,

365
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,960
Lady She secretly put him
in her maternal home in Luoyang.

366
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,960
But just on the eve before Lady She

367
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,480
and the young She Cong
were to be reunited,

368
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,000
She Cong was assassinated and killed.

369
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,960
Lady She sealed the news,
overwhelmed with sadness and terror.

370
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,920
So, she had to choose me as a substitute.

371
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,880
If she intends to keep it from you,
she would surely keep it tight.

372
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,280
How did you find out
about your own origins?

373
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,280
We have different dietary habits.

374
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,840
She could say
that I was raised in the Central Plain.

375
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,080
But we have a different temperament
and appearance.

376
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,080
Over time, I began to doubt.

377
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,040
My adopted mother, out of guilt,
told me the truth.

378
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,440
Later, she also sent someone
to investigate my background.

379
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,720
He said

380
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,800
I was born in a farmer's family
in Mao Village,

381
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,520
by the lower reaches of the Luo River.

382
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,760
And my parents had already passed away,

383
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,280
with no other relatives left.

384
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,840
Lies. These are all lies.

385
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,440
We are all alive and well.
They are all lying to you.

386
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,080
Leshan, don't get agitated.

387
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,520
Everything comes with a reason.

388
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,240
Lady She is far away in the northwest,
beyond reach.

389
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,760
Naturally, she had to entrust
the Liu family of Luoyang.

390
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,040
They couldn't protect the young general,
so they had to cover it up by all means.

391
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,440
Everyone has their own self-interest.

392
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,200
Later, a war broke out in the northwest,

393
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,320
and I stayed in the army with my father,
so I had no time to attend to this matter.

394
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,560
Late last year,
I returned to Luoyang alone,

395
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,600
following the river

396
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,520
and searching all the way.

397
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,360
I've searched through
every village and town.

398
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,960
Following my fragmented memories,

399
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,840
I found a farmer family

400
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,320
whose plum blossoms were in full bloom
in the courtyard.

401
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,280
I knew a family once lived here.

402
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,920
Because their son had died,

403
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,800
the mother and daughters

404
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,560
had suffered a great deal.

405
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,880
However,

406
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,320
fortunately, I now know my surname is Li,

407
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,320
and my family is still alive.

408
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,920
They went to Bianjing.

409
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,360
On the night before I wanted
to come to Bianjing,

410
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,400
I suddenly received a battle report
and had to return to the army.

411
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,720
However, I knew,

412
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,720
one day, I would definitely
find my family,

413
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,120
and I would certainly recognize them.

414
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,800
Fan'er.

415
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,600
This dream feels so real.

416
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,440
I am really scared

417
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,040
that this dream will abruptly end.

418
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Mom, this is not a dream.

419
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,680
Your son really is back.

420
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,680
Mom, Fan is really back. It's not a dream.

421
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,200
The beauty you are looking for

422
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,000
must be right here.

423
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,080
The young lady is 16 and really pretty.

424
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,680
But they are too poor to afford the dowry,

425
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,400
so she was presented to the official.

426
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,640
This young lady is excellent at cooking.

427
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,800
Master Cui, you will surely be satisfied.

428
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,240
Whether she's excellent at cooking
doesn't matter.

429
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,240
What matters is whether I like her.

430
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
Yes, please go in.

431
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,120
Here.

432
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,560
Thank you.

433
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,120
First, give him 40 lashes.

434
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,200
Yes, Master.

435
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,240
I am close to Minister Cui,

436
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,840
always by his side.

437
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,800
I bet you wouldn't dare to kill me.

438
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,960
Right. If I kill you,
I have to get punishment.

439
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,560
I want to grow old with my wife.

440
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,360
I wouldn't dare to risk my life for you.

441
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,440
Forty more lashes.

442
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,400
Master, he's passed out.

443
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,760
Send the petition and him together
to the Kaifeng Court.

444
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,920
Yes.

445
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,880
This weather!

446
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,080
Just a drizzle, but never raining

447
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,400
on the crops.

448
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,160
The authorities asked

449
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,080
every family to fill their water jars,

450
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,800
then stick in willow branches
and throw in a lizard to pray for rain.

451
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,680
Nonsense. Lizard?

452
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,600
Where could I catch a lizard?

453
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,160
Might as well catch a turtle.

454
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,880
Madam, may you stay safe.

455
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,920
Chunlai, watch the gate.

456
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,800
Madam.

457
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,920
You'd better leave,

458
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,560
and do not come here again.

459
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,880
With tens of thousands in wealth,

460
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,760
you can always find a wife
with a rich and prominent family.

461
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,040
Leshan has given up on you.

462
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,920
I suggest you give up too.

463
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,560
You should marry someone else soon.

464
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,760
I wish to get Leshan back.

465
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,720
I won't go against my promise
and marry someone else.

466
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,840
Mother-in-law, please forgive me.

467
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,920
You still hold onto the past?

468
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,280
It's the clothes you made for me
three years ago.

469
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,200
The old clothes always fit well.
It's hard to forget the connections.

470
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,240
Every time I wear it,
I recall how well you treated me.

471
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,760
And I haven't repaid your kindness
and fulfilled my filial piety.

472
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,720
That's why I risked my life
to fight for glory and wealth.

473
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,720
I want to bring honor to you,

474
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,360
so you can entrust Leshan to me.

475
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,320
Leshan doesn't want to.
It is not up to me.

476
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,720
From now on, don't call me
mother-in-law anymore.

477
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,440
I don't deserve it.

478
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,640
Mother-in-law.

479
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,680
If Leshan refuses to change her mind,
then I will not dare to force her.

480
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,840
But Mother-in-law…

481
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,960
Madam Li, I beg you to show some mercy

482
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,800
and take me in as a servant.

483
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,280
Consider it as a favor to me,

484
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,720
so I can dispel Leshan's resentment.

485
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,440
Madam Li, please.

486
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,280
- Master, I help you.
- No need.

487
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,320
Master, you were right.

488
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,080
Servants of the Yang family
are witnesses.

489
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,360
The Kaifeng Court has detained him
on the charge of theft.

490
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,160
On the second day, Lady Chen went
to visit the prisoner and brought food.

491
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,080
She also sent someone
to notify the Cui family.

492
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,200
I think someone is planning
to save Jiang Chaozong.

493
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,360
After all, he is
a favorite of Minister Cui.

494
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,720
Master, what should we do next?

495
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,080
Of course, continue chopping wood.

496
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,600
Don't you see we are standing here?

497
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,320
Don't stay here and be an eyesore.
Go get more information.

498
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,720
Master, you are really discerning.

499
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,440
Is it me to be an eyesore here?

500
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,360
I'll go get more information.

501
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,120
KAIFENG COURT PRISON

502
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,080
Hurry, he is coming.

503
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,680
- Come and help me.
- Help him.

504
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,880
Well…

505
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,560
Look at you.

506
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,080
You spent all day out messing around.

507
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,600
Once you're in trouble,
only family will take care of you.

508
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,800
I wonder how much money you got,
and you've been beaten up like this.

509
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,920
The assets of the Yang family
have been confiscated by the state.

510
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,280
All assets are returned
to the state treasury.

511
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,080
That scoundrel
colluded with two accountants,

512
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,600
falsely accusing me
of stealing ten gold from the Yang family.

513
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,600
Ten?

514
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,720
And a…

515
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,000
yellow jade seal
awarded by the Han Emperor.

516
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,800
Oh my.

517
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,760
Where am I supposed to turn them in?

518
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,800
Take it easy.

519
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,040
What kind of treasure have you got?

520
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,080
You've even deceived me.

521
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,520
If it wasn't for Minister Cui
pleading for you,

522
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,040
you would've died unjustly in there.

523
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,360
Yang Xian.

524
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,440
I swear to let you pay.

525
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,360
It's killing me.

526
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,280
Take it slow.

527
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,520
Take it slow.

528
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,360
You deserve it.

529
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,400
Finished chopping?

530
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,320
Now, fill up the water jar
and get rid of the weeds in the field.

531
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,240
The kitchen roof is leaking.
Fix it and the tiles as well.

532
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,320
Right.

533
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,280
Go to Liang's store in Tianshui Alley
and buy a bowl of sweet tofu pudding.

534
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,200
I want to have one.

535
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,000
Then, go to the Tang's jewel shop
to get the jewelry I bought.

536
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,080
- Did you get it?
- Yes, Leshan.

537
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,560
- Then get it done.
- Yes.

538
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,200
Are you really treating him
like a servant?

539
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,440
He brought this upon himself.
Let's see how many days he can bear it.

540
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,200
It's up to you, dear.

541
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,480
Lady Li, Master has fallen
from the horse at the polo match.

542
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,920
What?

543
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,000
Don't scare my mother.

544
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,440
- I'll go with you to look.
- Alright.

545
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,520
You lead the way.

546
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,960
His injuries are nothing serious.

547
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,280
Thank you, physician.

548
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,560
Brother, how are you feeling now?
Does it hurt?

549
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,240
I'm fine.

550
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,560
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

551
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,120
That old man, Cui Weizhi,

552
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,920
gets promoted rapidly by presenting
the palace with beauty and good omens.

553
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,240
Knowing my brother
was severely injured on the battlefield,

554
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,640
Cui Weizhi insisted he must win polo
before meeting His Majesty.

555
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,280
How arrogant he is!

556
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,880
You have no right to say so.

557
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,360
If it weren't for your rashness
on the battlefield,

558
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,760
falling into the Xia's ambush,

559
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,080
would your brother have been injured
saving you?

560
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,520
Old injuries haven't healed,
and now there's a new one.

561
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,920
It's all your fault.

562
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,520
Lady She, calm down.

563
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,960
Mother, She Min is still young.
Don't blame him.

564
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,600
The day your mother lost her son,

565
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,520
I got my lost son.

566
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,800
I owe her and the Li family an apology.

567
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,280
I should have personally visited
to apologize,

568
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,400
but…

569
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,560
But here, in Bianjing,

570
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,360
there are too many ill-intentioned people
eyeing the She family.

571
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,320
Thanks to that embroidered ball,

572
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,000
Zong could visit the Li family.

573
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,800
And it gave me an excuse
to invite you here.

574
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,720
- I…
- Mother said

575
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,480
Brother came to Bianjing
for actual business.

576
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,080
We've waited for so many years.
A little longer won't hurt.

577
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,080
From now on,

578
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,440
General She

579
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,240
is now my betrothed who caught
the Li family's embroidered ball.

580
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,840
Our two families
have to discuss the marriage.

581
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,880
What's wrong with me
visiting my betrothed?

582
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,680
Leshan.

583
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,360
You must not tell mother about this.
I don't want her to worry.

584
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,960
I understand.

585
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,640
Lady She, General.

586
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,520
There is a Mr. Yang outside who said
he has matters to discuss with you.

587
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,200
Then I shall excuse myself.

588
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,520
I'm Yang Xian. Greetings.

589
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,280
Mr. Yang, my old wound reoccurred,
and I am not in the best condition.

590
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,520
Let's skip these formalities.

591
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,040
But I don't deal with you usually.

592
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,080
I wonder why you insist on seeing me.

593
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,760
Leshan, come out.

594
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,960
How dare you be so arrogant
in front of my brother.

595
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,760
She Min, mind your words.

596
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,880
General, please do not blame him.

597
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,040
I heard that you were injured
by falling from a horse,

598
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,160
so I brought people
to carefully inspect the meadow

599
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,920
and found this.

600
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,760
It seems someone does not wish you
to meet His Majesty.

601
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,600
If you didn't have strong martial skills,

602
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,080
I'm afraid you might have lost your life.

603
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,240
Brother.

604
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,440
It must be
that treacherous minister's doing.

605
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,400
It would be good then.

606
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,320
- Why?
- General, let me tell you.

607
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,120
By the minister's side,
there is a loyal official Jiang Chaozong,

608
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,000
who exclusively helps Cui Weizhi
in flattering His Majesty

609
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,480
and framing the faithful officials.

610
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,480
My people have followed him and found
he rushed to the Jinming Pool Meadow

611
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,240
to conspire against someone
after leaving the Kaifeng Court Prison.

612
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,720
The Cui family causes trouble
for your family.

613
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,000
That Jiang Chaozong is an enemy
to my Yang family.

614
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,640
Then you and I are on the same side.

615
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,840
What does it matter
if we are on the same side or not?

616
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,000
If so, we must join hands
to get rid of the treacherous ones.

617
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,480
What can you do?

618
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,320
An ignorant person could make up
for lack of skill with diligence.

619
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,680
Can I not take on a great responsibility?

620
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,640
Explain yourself.

621
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,440
Leshan.

622
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,760
What do you want?

623
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,880
Leshan, do you still remember our bet?

624
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,360
We bet on a threefold profit,
but I've now earned over a hundredfold.

625
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,120
Leshan, does it mean I win the bet?

626
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,680
We agreed on a limit of one month.

627
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,240
It's been several years now.
You really are shameless.

628
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,560
Someone broke the promise first

629
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,360
and wanted to make things
difficult for me.

630
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,680
One month became three years.
And you have to wait.

631
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,520
Can you blame this on me?

632
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,960
You!

633
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,200
Rest assured.

634
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,080
I'm not here to cause you trouble.

635
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,920
Since you want to marry
into the She family,

636
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,880
even as your former husband, I should
properly assess your new husband,

637
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,640
to see whether he is great enough for you

638
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,600
to marry.

639
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,320
But this is not urgent. We have
more important things to do now.

640
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,680
Please help me.

641
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,240
I am not here to help you, but to help…

642
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,640
my Mr. She.

643
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,760
Yes, to help your Mr. She.

644
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,560
Please get in the sedan chair.

645
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,520
Hurry up. Keep up.

646
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,560
Keep up.

647
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,040
- Keep up. Hurry.
- Go.

648
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,120
For Qianyuan Festival on April 14th,
Cui Weizhi searched throughout the country

649
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,600
and gathered 2,000 children
to celebrate His Majesty's birthday.

650
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,600
These must be the children.

651
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,240
The children's troupe dance
happens every year.

652
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,280
Just gathering 200 children
to create more fun.

653
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,160
While he's making such a big fuss…

654
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,360
These children were kidnapped by him?

655
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,520
That Cui guy harbors ulterior motives.

656
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,440
Master Du impeached him
in front of His Majesty,

657
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,800
but got rebuked quite a bit.

658
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,120
That foolish Emperor.

659
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,800
Set off to Baiyun Temple.

660
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,960
Go.

661
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,880
- How is it?
- It smells so good.

662
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,440
- Be careful.
- Okay.

663
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,400
Here you are.

664
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,440
- It's all hot.
- Eat it while it's hot.

665
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,120
Hurry.

666
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,240
YIER HOUSE

667
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,560
<i>Turns out she's a courtesan.</i>

668
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,880
Go.

669
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,960
Find more about this lady.

670
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,080
Yes.

671
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,240
No laughing or loud talking allowed
inside the sedan chair.

672
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,840
Nor is it allowed to stop halfway.

673
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,200
At the palace gate,
someone will receive you.

674
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,200
If someone questions you…

675
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,120
I shall respond,

676
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,920
Bianjing has long been in a drought,
and His Majesty is deeply worried.

677
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,600
The Minister gathered seven Taoist nuns
with pure character

678
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,640
to pray for rain in the palace.

679
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,080
I am not at ease if I don't escort them.
Let's go.

680
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,880
I have served you for quite some time now.

681
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,440
I guarantee there will be no mistakes.

682
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,720
Rest assured.

683
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,440
Set off.

684
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,280
Let's go.

685
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,440
Master, let me escort you back.

686
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,640
Prepare a carriage

687
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,680
to Zhu Silang Tavern.

688
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,280
Why are you going there again?

689
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,920
Lady Chen has mentioned,
beauty harms people.

690
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,440
I should advise you not to go there.

691
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,680
Just listen to me. Go.

692
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,440
Hurry up.

693
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,560
Hurry up.

694
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,680
What's the situation? Let's go.

695
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,200
- Go.
- Go, go.

696
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,880
- Make them move.
- Go.

697
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,200
Don't block our way.

698
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,920
Be careful with the sedan chair.

699
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,760
Don't go this way.
Move over there. We need to pass.

700
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,880
Drive the sheep away.
They're blocking the road.

701
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,920
Move aside. Drive the sheep…

702
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,840
Make way. We need to go through.

703
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,640
Well…

704
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,360
Well…

705
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,800
Hurry up.

706
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,920
Sorry.

707
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,800
There's no time. Hurry up.

708
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,440
This has caused a delay.

709
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,280
Hurry up. Set off.

710
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,520
We're late. Hurry up.

711
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,720
You girl!

712
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,160
Can't you hear someone knocking?
Are you waiting for me to go open it?

713
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,560
Yes.

714
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,480
Hurry.

715
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,880
Leshan.

716
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,400
She's just your father's concubine,
not your birth mother.

717
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,320
What's wrong?

718
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,680
She's such an ungrateful person,
scheming against people's lives.

719
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,360
If she's sent to prison,
she'll end up with limbs

720
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,320
and tendons severed.

721
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,760
Even if we hang her to death today,
the heaven will forgive you.

722
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,160
Let go!

723
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,200
Leshan, we can't punish her
without letting the authorities know.

724
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,280
Better to accuse her to the Kaifeng Court.

725
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,560
Why are you so foolish?

726
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,480
If we report this to the authorities,

727
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,840
will that chest of gold
still belong to the Yang family?

728
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,960
It would be confiscated to the country.

729
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,240
No, we can't afford to commit a murder.

730
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,840
You coward!

731
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,600
It was you who said to reclaim the gold

732
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,480
to keep it for our lifelong use,
so I'd help you.

733
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,640
And now you back off?

734
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,760
If we can't get the truth
out of her by the dawn,

735
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,560
I'll brand your face first.

736
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,920
Leshan.

737
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,760
Leshan, wait for me.

738
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,480
Keep a close watch of her.

739
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

740
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,160
<i>Gold?</i>

741
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:29,080
<i>These two people might just</i>
<i>put on a show to deceive me.</i>

742
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,760
