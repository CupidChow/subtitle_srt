EPISODE 28

2
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,640
KAIFENG COURT PRISON

3
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,600
Mr. Huang.

4
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,360
Mr. Xue.

5
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
Bring the person up.

6
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,600
Last night, I wanted
to interrogate an important prisoner.

7
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,160
Kaifeng Court's Official Qiao Du

8
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,280
lied about a malaria outbreak in prison
to escape with the female prisoner.

9
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,280
I caught them on the spot.

10
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,240
The incident occurred suddenly.

11
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,440
Sorry for not informing you
in time, Lord Shen.

12
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,000
I hope you would not blame me

13
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,000
for overstepping my duties.

14
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,000
I dare not.

15
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,640
Qiao Du, what's going on?

16
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,840
Lord Shen asked you a question.
Why don't you answer?

17
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,400
Where are you taking this female prisoner?

18
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,160
Fang.

19
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
You tell me.

20
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,120
Yes.

21
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,560
It was Qiao Du who had someone
send me the drug,

22
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,120
teaching me to feign malaria
to escape from prison.

23
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,800
Drug? What drug?

24
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,600
Mr. Du.

25
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,360
These were all Mr. Qiao's order.

26
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,920
What's wrapped is Semen Cannabis.

27
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,360
After one takes it, they vomit
and have diarrhea, appearing delirious,

28
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,240
just like having malaria.

29
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,160
After the prison physician's diagnosis,
we wouldn't dare keep the patient.

30
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,320
According to regulation,
we must send the patient away.

31
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,440
- Where do you send her?
- To the infirmary.

32
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,360
To find a corpse with a similar appearance

33
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,280
to deceive everyone
that the patient has died.

34
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,760
I have also heard rumors in the past

35
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,120
that people often bribe prison officials
with large sums of money

36
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,720
to secretly release prisoners,
but report them as dead from illness.

37
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,160
I never would have thought that,

38
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,560
Lord Shen, under your jurisdiction,

39
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,680
such outrageous things would happen.

40
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,000
Shen Huizhao.

41
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,800
Qiao Du is your subordinate.

42
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
How do you explain this?

43
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,880
There is no need
for further interrogation.

44
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,560
I believe that Lady Fang
is wrongfully accused,

45
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,600
- so--
- Nonsense!

46
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,600
You have no relation to Fang.

47
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,120
Without someone's instigation,
how dare you take such a risk?

48
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,360
Things have come to this.

49
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,840
Yet you still attempt to use excuses
to hide the truth.

50
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,200
Mr. Xue.

51
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,840
You seem to imply something.

52
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,480
Fang attempted to escape the prison,
which is doubly guilty.

53
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,760
She should be sentenced to death
by dismemberment.

54
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,560
I'll give you one last chance.

55
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,240
- Tell us the truth.
- I…

56
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Do you think Shen Huizhao
can help you escape?

57
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,400
Let me tell you the truth.

58
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,280
Tonight, that Lu Jiulang
died of serious injury,

59
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,120
and the Lu family
is busy preparing the funeral.

60
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,840
Shen Huizhao has committed false judgment
and intentional prisoner release.

61
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,080
He's in trouble himself.

62
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,200
Now, I'm the only one in the world

63
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,400
who can help you.

64
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,640
Say it.

65
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,680
- Say it.
- It's my cousin.

66
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,120
I have been engaged to my cousin
since childhood.

67
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,760
But due to mourning,
we missed the wedding date.

68
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,680
I didn't expect he'd called off
the engagement and marry another.

69
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,000
When I went to the Shen family,
they threatened me with their power,

70
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,240
seducing me to conduct adultery.

71
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,840
He feared that someone would expose him
and his reputation would get ruined,

72
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,600
so he forced me
to marry into the Lu family.

73
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,840
He told me to use the excuse of a wedding
in mourning period to escape the crime.

74
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,520
And it was my cousin who asked Qiao Du

75
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,240
to enter prison and save me.

76
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,920
Stop slandering against the official.

77
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,040
Mr. Huang, this woman is holding grudges
for the engagement being called off,

78
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,640
so she seeks revenge,

79
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,880
lying and framing the innocent.

80
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,080
Every word I say is true. I dare not lie.

81
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,040
I hope you can be lenient with me.

82
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,560
Shen Huizhao.

83
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,000
His Majesty holds you in great trust,

84
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,880
allowing you not to avoid cases related
to your relatives, to judge fairly.

85
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,360
Yet you are sanctimonious,
with unfaithful actions and words.

86
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,440
You first forced the girl
to conduct adultery.

87
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,680
Later, you covered up for your relatives

88
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,880
and committed the major crime of
releasing prisoners without authorization.

89
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,520
You committed a crime beyond forgiveness

90
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,360
and can't hold the position
as the Chief Official of Kaifeng Court.

91
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,080
Today, with Mr. Huang as witness,

92
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,280
you don't have a chance
to argue with that.

93
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,200
I must purge the imperial court
of treacherous scoundrels

94
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,560
and petition His Majesty

95
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,240
to severely punish you.

96
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,560
I have judged cases impartially
and never practiced favoritism.

97
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,120
I have no guilt towards
His Majesty, the imperial court,

98
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,400
or the world.

99
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,560
If you two believe what she said,

100
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,080
you are free to petition His Majesty.

101
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,560
I am willing to remove
my official rank and accept…

102
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,680
all interrogation.

103
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,600
You! I've been considerate of you,
but look at you.

104
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,720
Colluding with that woman
and creating such a scandal.

105
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,200
Let me ask you when you love her
and how much you love her.

106
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,120
Don't you still want your future
and reputation?

107
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,840
And you don't want me, your lawful wife.

108
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,120
- Haode, listen to me.
- You shut up.

109
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,120
Let me ask you. Did you teach that Cui

110
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,360
to come to me?

111
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,800
- How would she know where the entrance is?
- What's happening?

112
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,720
How dare she cause such trouble!

113
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,680
Marrying during the mourning period?

114
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,600
What a ridiculous excuse!

115
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,000
Doesn't she feel ashamed?

116
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,040
And that Qiao Du… Don't touch me.

117
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,320
And that Qiao Du…
I wonder why he's so anxious,

118
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,200
like his own wife's
on the execution grounds.

119
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,960
So, he did it all for you.

120
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,120
In the end, I've become a pawn

121
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,800
to be used by others.
All my good intentions wasted.

122
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,520
Do you know?
During tomorrow's court interrogation,

123
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,320
in public,

124
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,120
you not only will be dismissed,
but sent to prison for the crime.

125
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,040
You'll implicate the whole family
and become a laughingstock to others.

126
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,840
Shen Huizhao, let's part ways.

127
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,360
Haode.

128
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,960
Get lost!

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,160
- Go.
- Leave.

130
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,240
We had an agreement.

131
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,200
Just do as you said, and my lady
will be given a lighter sentence.

132
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,240
Don't lie to me.

133
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,880
Be patient. That day will come.

134
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,800
I can't wait.

135
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,840
If she can't get a lighter sentence
tomorrow, I will tell the truth at Yamen.

136
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,320
Easy.

137
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,840
Lady Fang has a message for you.
Come closer.

138
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,000
KAIFENG COURT

139
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,120
Shen Huizhao.

140
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,480
That day you sat here
and sentenced my son to death,

141
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,240
did you ever think that one day

142
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,120
you would be dismissed
and put on trial, becoming

143
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,960
a prisoner?

144
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,520
I really never thought

145
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,320
that my upright and unyielding teacher

146
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,640
would become like this today.

147
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,400
What? To go on trial,

148
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,640
yet you still don't want
to take off your official robe?

149
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,000
Lord Shen, after today's hearing,

150
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,160
you, who were once known
as the upright official

151
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,600
trusted by His Majesty,

152
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,800
will become the villain who's despised,

153
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,080
condemned, and cursed by everyone.

154
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,160
By then,

155
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,560
there will be many things
you'd never expect.

156
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,120
Xue Guang, for your own self-desires,
you've rashly judged a lawsuit,

157
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,840
set all sorts of traps
to frame an imperial official.

158
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,040
Do you confess your crime?

159
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,880
Shen Huizhao, have you lost your mind?

160
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,320
Today, I am judging your crime.

161
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,920
Why are you instead questioning me?

162
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,000
Mr. Huang has arrived.

163
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,360
Mr. Huang.

164
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,840
Mr. Huang,
please make a fair judgment in court.

165
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,560
No, I am here on His Majesty's order

166
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,360
to attend the trial.

167
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,240
Lord Shen.

168
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,720
You have promised to His Majesty

169
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,680
that you'd certainly
make a fair judgment on this case.

170
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,120
I shall wait and see.

171
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,360
Hold court trial!

172
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,400
Bring in the prisoners.

173
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,040
My lady.

174
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,840
Mr. Xue, do you recognize them?

175
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,160
These two are witnesses accusing Lord Shen
of practicing favoritism.

176
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,640
But I don't recognize the two of them.

177
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,800
The servant, Mao Chun,

178
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,240
is the one
who cleaned up outside my study.

179
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,640
After Fang Yuchan was imprisoned,

180
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,480
he incited Lady Fang's wet nurse, Cui,

181
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,080
and lied that Lady Fang's mourning
for her father was over

182
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,000
so she could escape punishment.

183
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,240
Last night, he even attempted to kill Cui,

184
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,640
but I caught him on the spot.

185
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,920
Cui, he wanted to kill you?

186
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,320
My lady, I almost couldn't see you again.

187
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,000
Lord Shen, it was Mao Chun
who convinced me

188
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,240
that marrying during the mourning period
would result in a lighter sentence.

189
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,760
I was eager to save my lady,

190
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,760
so I slipped the information
to Madam Haode.

191
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,720
I made up all these lies.

192
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,880
I deserve to die.

193
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,360
Lord Shen, I was merely talking nonsense
after being drunk,

194
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,760
and I didn't expect
this old lady to believe it.

195
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,320
When it didn't work out,
she blamed me.

196
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,760
Thus, we only had a quarrel.

197
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,720
I had no intention to kill her.

198
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,200
Take him away and punish him
with 50 strokes of the cane first.

199
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,760
- Yes.
- Lord Shen, please spare me.

200
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,120
Lord Shen, please spare me.

201
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,160
- Lady Fang, it'll be fine.
- Lord Shen.

202
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,080
You practiced favoritism
and judged the case for personal gains,

203
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,640
and found others to take the blame.

204
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,960
Trying to escape the crime
of judging falsely?

205
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,080
This is just too childish.

206
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,640
No rush. Qiao Du,

207
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,720
why did you secretly release the prisoner?

208
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,720
All my words and actions
are all out of loyalty to you.

209
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,680
Nonsense!

210
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,400
Ever since I got attacked by an assassin,

211
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,680
I suspected that someone close to me
was leaking information.

212
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,440
I told you to go to Hangzhou again
to investigate the Fang family.

213
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,120
It was to find out your intentions.

214
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,040
But two days later, the man you sent
is still in the tavern

215
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,800
30 miles from Bianjing.

216
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,640
What is he waiting for?

217
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,720
Naturally, he's waiting for me
to be dismissed and interrogated.

218
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,480
I asked you
to covertly protect Lu Jiulang,

219
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,480
yet you didn't do what I said again

220
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,160
and went to the Li family
to stir up trouble.

221
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,680
Don't you ever wonder

222
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,440
why things have gone so smoothly?

223
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,040
If that Fang Yuchan dies,

224
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,520
then this case
would be resolved immediately, right?

225
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,840
I asked Li Shouhua of the Li family
to cooperate with me

226
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,720
and secretly push the progress.

227
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,320
I just wanted to see
how this mastermind behind the scenes

228
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,160
framed me and accused me.

229
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,960
Regarding the prison escape, I had already
reported it to His Majesty early on.

230
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,000
I set this trap

231
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,040
to wait for you to be caught
by your own scheme.

232
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,000
Qiao Du, I have given you chances
again and again.

233
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,560
If you had realized your mistake
and mended it in time,

234
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,880
you wouldn't end up as a prisoner.

235
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,640
I didn't know.

236
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,840
But do you know

237
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,080
that the person behind this
for his own selfish desires

238
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,080
even tried to kill Cui and Lu Jiulang?

239
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,840
As a chivalrous martial artist
with a tender heart,

240
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,800
you have become an accomplice to murder.

241
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,440
Don't you regret it?

242
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,600
I didn't know.

243
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,200
I didn't know.

244
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
- You!
- Kneel.

245
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,480
You promised me you wouldn't kill again.

246
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,120
You promised me

247
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,960
that you would only
deal with Shen Huizhao alone

248
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,880
and never kill anyone again.

249
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,400
You lied to me!

250
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,200
- Xue Guang, you…
- How dare you!

251
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,960
I have been an official for decades.

252
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,880
I don't care about any rumor or slander.

253
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,640
Xue Guang, you still refuse to confess.

254
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,120
- I have no crime to confess.
- Fine.

255
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,520
I have two witnesses to come forward.

256
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,240
Haode.

257
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,600
Lord Shen and my husband have discussed
and set up the plan.

258
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,880
How did you know it?

259
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,920
Huizhao's expression and tone
towards Qiao Du

260
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,240
seemed a bit strange,
so I paid attention to it.

261
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,720
Besides, you are so shrewd and careful.

262
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,920
How could you easily agree
on the prison escape?

263
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,280
The quicker you agreed,
the more suspicious the matter.

264
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,120
Don't be mad.

265
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,160
I asked the two of them
to keep it from you and Leshan.

266
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,120
Only then could we fool the others.

267
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,320
Shouhua.

268
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,080
Haode.

269
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,600
Do you think that Qiao Du will confess?

270
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,160
You…

271
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,520
You're still alive?

272
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,200
Qiao Du, since I have suspected you,

273
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,360
how would I entrust
the important witness to you?

274
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,440
Lu Sheng, is Lady Fang kneeling here

275
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,040
the one who stabbed you?

276
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,640
Yes.

277
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,160
That night, she saw my ugly face
and was unwilling to marry me.

278
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,360
She pulled out the dagger from her waist,
wanting to commit suicide.

279
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,840
I stepped forward to stop her.

280
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,960
In the struggle, I was mistakenly injured.

281
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,120
It was a suicide attempt, not murder?

282
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,600
It was a suicide attempt, not murder.

283
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,200
Fang Yuchan, do you hear it?

284
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,320
Tell the truth.

285
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,240
I heard it. Please discern the truth.

286
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,720
I am trapped in prison,
with no means to appeal.

287
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,120
Xue Guang told me

288
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,520
that Jiulang was already dead,

289
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,440
and the Lu family
would certainly not let me go.

290
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,560
He asked me to do as he said,

291
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,800
to frame Lord Shen
for practicing favoritism,

292
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,680
then he would seek His Majesty's pardon
to reduce my sentence.

293
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,320
Otherwise, he would charge me
with the murder of my husband,

294
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,840
and the crime of prison escape,

295
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,680
and put me to death
by dismembering the body.

296
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,240
Xue Guang, as the Minister
of Dali Supreme Court,

297
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,040
how dare you bend the law to extract
confessions and frame a colleague?

298
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,440
A prisoner on death row
who tried to escape prison

299
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,360
accused Shen Huizhao firmly yesterday,

300
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,760
yet shifted all the blame onto me today.

301
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,680
How can you trust her?

302
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,320
I do not accept this.

303
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
You instigated the Bianjing physician
Liu Zaichang

304
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,240
to poison Lu Jiulang to death.

305
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,760
I caught the person and got the drug.
You can't deny it anymore.

306
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,160
You are slandering me!

307
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,480
I've heard how marvelous
this physician Liu's medical skills are.

308
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,080
Yet I haven't met him.

309
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,120
How dare you slander
the Minister of Dali Supreme Court!

310
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,680
Xue Guang, if it weren't for you
threatening me with the evidence

311
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,280
of my pharmacy endangering other lives…

312
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,680
I've been practicing medicine
and saving lives for 40 years.

313
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,240
Why would I poison my patient to death?

314
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,880
Lord Shen, I know
that I deserve punishment.

315
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,920
Everything I said is true.

316
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,120
I am willing to accept the punishment
and sign my confession here in court.

317
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,400
- I hope you won't let the mastermind go.
- Shut up.

318
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,680
Shen Huizhao, that servant Mao Chun
is from your Shen family.

319
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,440
Li Haode bought the Semen Cannabis.

320
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,640
The Kaifeng Court Official
secretly released Lady Fang.

321
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,640
They are all related to you.

322
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,040
What does it have to do with me?

323
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,400
With clear evidence presented,
how dare you still deny!

324
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,920
I might have bribed one.

325
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,080
Could I possibly bribe
all these witnesses in here?

326
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,800
Our ancestors made laws
after careful consideration,

327
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,040
and we should enforce the law

328
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,760
with fairness and justice.

329
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
If for one's self desires

330
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,920
one disregards the law and justice,

331
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,360
harming the innocents,

332
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,680
even if one had much achievement,
they would vanish in an instant.

333
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,920
The imperial laws couldn't tolerate you.

334
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,240
Even the world couldn't tolerate you.

335
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,520
Teacher…

336
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,760
wake up.

337
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
I have lost.

338
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,240
- I didn't expect it to be true.
- What is it?

339
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,080
- I have also heard about it.
- Yes.

340
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,640
KAIFENG COURT

341
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,320
Lu Jiulang bears in mind the favor
of being saved by you,

342
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,960
so he's willing to plead for Lady Fang.

343
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,400
What will happen to them?

344
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,240
The Minister of Dali Supreme Court wields
great power. He violated the law.

345
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,640
Only His Majesty
could judge his punishment.

346
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,680
As for Qiao Du,

347
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,640
he is sentenced to 30 canings
and to be exiled to Cangzhou.

348
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,560
What a pity.

349
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,960
- Let's go.
- Where to?

350
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,560
To the Li family and bring back my wife.

351
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,120
Jingwei.

352
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,840
Lord Shen, my apologies. You can't go in.

353
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,800
I'm here to pick up Haode.
Leshan, please let me in.

354
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,760
Qingshi.

355
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,560
Haode said

356
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,520
you didn't complete the bride fetching,
wedding ceremony, and the temple visit.

357
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,840
Thus, you two are not considered
as a married couple.

358
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,960
Lord Shen, please leave.

359
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,920
You are so rude.

360
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,880
Lord Shen, what should we do?

361
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,600
Go back.

362
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,720
Lord Shen, aren't you
taking Lady Haode back?

363
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,280
He's left?

364
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,160
So, he's really left and never returned?

365
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,440
He came here to pick you up.

366
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,360
I told you not to put on an act.

367
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,760
Now, this is great.

368
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,720
You can't go back now.

369
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,960
So, he could collude with
my elder brother-in-law to deceive me,

370
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,440
but I couldn't fool him?

371
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,320
It's not fair.

372
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,280
He got the cold shoulder
and didn't want his wife anymore.

373
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,000
I haven't heard of anyone nearby
having a wedding.

374
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,200
Who is this for?

375
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,120
Coming.

376
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,440
- Coming.
- What?

377
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,200
You silly girl!

378
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,920
What are you waiting for?
Your bridal sedan chair has arrived.

379
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,480
Huizhao.

380
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,640
W-What are you doing?

381
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,360
Of course, I'm here
to complete the bride fetching,

382
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,800
wedding ceremony,
and the ancestral temple visit.

383
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,800
I would marry you
into the Shen family in glory

384
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,160
and make you my wife.

385
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,880
Huizhao, so you knew everything all along.

386
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,440
I'm so delighted.

387
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,640
Just hold on

388
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,640
and change into your wedding attire.

389
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,360
Old Lady is waiting
for her daughter-in-law to offer tea.

390
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,680
Haode.

391
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,040
You girl!

392
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,040
The makeup isn't even finished yet.

393
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,320
Wait for me. Coming.

394
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,960
Hurry up.

395
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
Hurry up.

396
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,560
You can't catch up.

397
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,280
- Congratulations, Lord Shen.
- Congratulations, Lord Shen.

398
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,040
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

399
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,720
- Congratulations.
- Bravo.

400
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,680
What a joy.

401
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,200
Congratulations, Lord Shen.

402
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,200
Congratulations, Lord Shen.

403
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,400
Mother, sister, where are you?

404
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,240
Mother, sister, where are you?

405
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,120
Where are you?

406
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,240
Why are you here all alone?

407
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,320
My mother is so biased.
I don't want to see her.

408
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,040
But I miss home so much,
and I miss my mother.

409
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,320
Let's go. I'll take you home.

410
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:32,400
SECOND DAY OF THE THIRD MONTH

411
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,600
This won't do.

412
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,120
Yesterday, I was busy preparing the room.

413
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,240
Didn't I ask you to replace
the fruit on the tray with the best?

414
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,800
Mom, Lamian tea costs 200 coins a catty.

415
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,480
We don't bear drink it ourselves,
yet you say it isn't good enough.

416
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,200
You don't know anything.

417
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,720
Change it to the best Hunan Mountain Tea.
Can't let the He family look down on us.

418
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,640
- Hurry!
- Alright.

419
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,520
Wine.

420
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,560
A jar must hold four catties of water.

421
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,120
Mom, it was you who mixed the water in it.

422
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,120
And you even complained
that it was too little.

423
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,880
I mixed it myself?

424
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,120
The new son-in-law comes to visit us,
can it be the same?

425
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,440
Madame He is a meticulous person.

426
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,360
We can't let the He family
look down on Leshan.

427
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,280
Hurry up. Go.

428
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,200
- Go change it.
- Okay.

429
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,240
Go change it.

430
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,800
Two, four…

431
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,560
Hurry up. Mother-in-law.

432
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,680
The groom's family is coming
with the betrothal gifts.

433
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,240
The person urging the bride to dress
is near the alley entrance.

434
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,480
Qiongnu, Chunlai.
Double-check the gifts in return.

435
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,440
- Okay.
- Leshan.

436
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,000
- Have you finished your makeup, Leshan?
- Come over.

437
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,760
Lianghan, you go with An

438
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,440
to the gate to welcome them.
Don't slight the bride's fetching team.

439
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,400
- Go now.
- Okay.

440
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,840
Leshan, my dear, are you done
with your makeup yet?

441
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,880
Leshan.

442
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,480
- The bride's fetching team is already--
- Mother. Alright, don't rush her.

443
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,600
They are all waiting.

444
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,160
- If we make them wait too long…
- Coming. Look.

445
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,880
Are you still

446
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,520
my dear Leshan?

447
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,960
She got up to do her makeup
early last night.

448
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,080
You said

449
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,000
we have to let all the relatives, friends,
and neighbors know how great Leshan is.

450
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,960
This also brings honor to the He family.

451
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,080
Nothing good comes too late.

452
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,520
The bridal sedan chair is about to arrive.

453
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,960
Mom, are you afraid
your son-in-law will run away?

454
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,120
Exactly.

455
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,440
He is marrying such a beautiful bride.

456
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,560
Why can't Mr. He wait?

457
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,560
I guarantee that once he sees her,
he'll be fascinated.

458
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,520
Mom.

459
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,160
Are you that eager to send me off?

460
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,240
You won't even let me
stay at home for a bit longer.

461
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,800
You girl!

462
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,240
Alright, everything is fine.

463
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,360
I'm just worried about your temperament.

464
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,480
He Guangyuan is gentle and soft.

465
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,080
The He family is also quite well-off.

466
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,040
They have a simple family.
After you marry into their family,

467
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,800
your mother-in-law is kind,
and the sister-in-law knows etiquette.

468
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,920
And you won't have to worry
about household affairs.

469
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,720
You won't get wronged.

470
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,800
But you must learn to control your temper.

471
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,960
From now on,

472
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,480
you should be kind to your in-laws
and considerate to your husband,

473
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,600
becoming a nice wife
who supports her husband

474
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,640
and teaches her children well.

475
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,520
Do you hear me?

476
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,200
Can you make me proud?

477
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,240
You can't do whatever you want
like you do at home.

478
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,440
Mom.

479
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,600
Don't worry. I understand.

480
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,600
Even if I marry,
I will always be a part of the Li family,

481
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,840
upholding the instructions
of the Li family.

482
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,160
As the old saying goes,
kind parents and filial sons,

483
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,200
virtuous husbands and wise wives.

484
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,840
The kind elders
and the virtuous husbands come first.

485
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,680
After I marry off,

486
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,440
if they respect me, I will be forgiving.

487
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,480
I will never hit my in-laws
nor bully my husband.

488
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,120
I will never bring shame
to the ancestors of the Li family.

489
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,920
But if someone provokes me,

490
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,400
I'm not a timid person,

491
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,160
I might just beat him.

492
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,760
If it happens, don't blame me
for being rude or un-filial.

493
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,960
You! You girl!

494
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,400
Mom, don't.

495
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,040
On such a joyful day,
we can't make a scene and be laughed at.

496
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,960
Wait. As her elder sisters, you should

497
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,120
manage her well. What…

498
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,520
Mom.

499
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,920
The groom has arrived.

500
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,720
Mom.

501
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,640
Clean my room every day.

502
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,840
I'm just taking a look.
If I'm not happy with the He family,

503
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,920
- I'll come back.
- Let's go.

504
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,960
- Okay.
- I'm just taking a look there.

505
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,240
If I'm not happy with the He family,
I'll come back.

506
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,400
Hey.

507
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,560
Leshan.

508
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,720
- Take it slow. Your bridal veil.
- Leshan.

509
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,480
- Leshan, put on your bridal veil.
- Mother.

510
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,920
I wonder what day today is.

511
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,120
The dresser stands on the balcony
is getting closer.

512
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,360
Some people say
that hibiscus grows in water,

513
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,040
but it blooms in the bronze mirror.

514
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,000
Good. Okay.

515
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,840
What? It's not acceptable
to pass off with another's poem.

516
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,520
Right, Yuanming is correct.

517
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,240
It's not difficult
to invite the bride out.

518
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,560
It depends on whether
you're sincere or not.

519
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,800
Mr. Du, don't make things difficult.
You're the third-ranked scholar.

520
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,520
- No one shows off in front of you.
- Right.

521
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,840
For the sake of me, please let him pass.

522
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,800
No way.

523
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,880
- No way.
- No.

524
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,120
- No way.
- No.

525
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,360
On this wedding day,
there's no distinction between us.

526
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,960
Moreover, Mr. He is different now.

527
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,440
Do not act shy like a lady.

528
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,800
If you have any skills, show us.

529
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,240
You must show them off anyway.

530
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,760
- Yes.
- Compose a poem and you'll pass.

531
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,840
Greetings to you all.

532
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,520
I pay my respects to you all.

533
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,960
No, compose a poem.

534
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,360
- Compose a poem.
- Compose a poem.

535
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,520
It's noon.
The auspicious moment is about to pass.

536
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,960
Please, please let the bride come out.

537
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,880
- Poem.
- No.

538
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,200
- You have to compose a poem.
- You can't get in otherwise.

539
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,360
- Hurry up.
- You have to compose a poem.

540
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,680
- Try.
- Give it a try.

541
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,040
<i>Joy fills the gate</i>

542
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,960
- <i>Brightness illuminates the silk</i>
- They have searched all the talents

543
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,680
in Bianjing and chose this man,

544
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,280
who's even shyer than Leshan.

545
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,240
Look at him blushing all over.
He's become like the bride.

546
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,280
Brightness…

547
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,520
I heard from Haode
that the Li family is choosing a husband

548
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,560
for Leshan differently.

549
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,080
They choose one
that won't fight or talk back…

550
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,880
<i>- Brightness illuminates the silk</i>
- …and never complain.

551
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,480
Madam is discerning. Hurry up.

552
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,040
<i>Rouge brings color</i>

553
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,800
<i>Green varnishes the palace</i>

554
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,920
- Alright, move.
- It's out of rhyme.

555
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,160
- It's not a poem.
- No way.

556
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,840
- Let me in first.
- No way.

557
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,200
- The bride's come out.
- Let me in.

558
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,920
- Let him in.
- Let him in.

559
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,120
The bride has come out.

560
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,800
- She's out.
- Forget it, Yuanming.

561
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,640
- Here she comes.
- She's here.

562
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,280
Wonderful.

563
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,120
He's truly blessed.

564
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,240
Such a great daughter-in-law.

565
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,600
Bride, please go onto the sedan chair.

566
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,960
Let's go.

567
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,760
Mom.

568
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,080
I'm here. Don't worry. Just go.

569
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,160
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

570
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,920
Welcoming happiness, dispatching joy.

571
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,840
The bride sets off.

572
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,680
- Good.
- Good.

573
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,640
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

574
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,160
- Congratulations.
- Bravo.

575
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,000
Look how shy he is.

576
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,160
May you have a child soon.

577
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,760
Live a happy life.

578
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,120
- Live a harmonious life forever.
- Bravo.

579
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,720
- Congratulations.
- Great.

580
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,120
Look how happy he is.

581
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,360
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

582
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,960
Leshan.

583
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,640
Remember what I told you.

584
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,840
Leshan.

585
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,200
- Give me two.
- Okay.

586
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,600
Whose family is having a wedding?

587
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,880
What a good day.

588
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,800
I wonder whose family is having a wedding.

589
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,760
Master.

590
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,080
- Tell him to make way.
- Yes.

591
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,840
Stop, stop.

592
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,600
Whose bridal sedan is this?

593
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,080
You are not discerning at all.

594
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,400
Make way.

595
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:02,920
Make way.

596
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,120
- Make way.
- Let us go through.

597
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,760
- Move.
- Move.

598
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,800
Which Yang family is it? So dominant.

599
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,960
Master, his aunt is Concubine Yang,

600
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,520
who personally raised His Majesty.

601
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,160
He's related to the Empress Dowager,

602
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,040
he has a sister in His Majesty's favor,
and just got promoted to imperial consort.

603
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,720
We must not offend the imperial kins.

604
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,080
Perhaps let them go first.

605
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,360
Right, move way!

606
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,840
Go, hurry!

607
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,360
- Move.
- Move to the side!

608
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,680
Hurry, to the side!

609
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,160
- Master.
- Come.

610
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,200
To the side.

611
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,640
- Stand firm.
- Be careful.

612
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,840
Be careful not to jostle the bride.

613
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,480
Matron of honor, what happened?

614
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,640
Do not fear. Everything is fine.
Don't let the bridal veil fall.

615
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,640
The road's wide,
yet you bumped into us?

616
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,640
You are too outrageous.

617
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,960
- Put it down first.
- Put down.

618
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,560
You!

619
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,720
- What do you want?
- Fight him.

620
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,680
- Being unreasonable, right?
- Leshan.

621
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,560
Don't fight.

622
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,800
- Don't fight.
- Stop it.

623
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,800
Stop it.

624
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,200
- Stop it.
- Stop it.

625
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,560
Leshan, are you alright?

626
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,600
Master.

627
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,200
- Master.
- Why did you hit me?

628
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,120
- Why did you hit me?
- Don't hit Master.

629
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,280
Stop.

630
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,400
Stop.

631
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,360
Stop.

632
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,920
Stop hitting, Master.

633
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It's a day of great joy.

634
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,360
Stop it.

635
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,520
- Stop it.
- Beat him.

636
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,720
Stop it.

637
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,320
Don't unveil it.

638
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,320
- Help!
- Stop fighting.

639
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,960
Matron of honor!

640
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,720
- I'm here.
- Stop it.

641
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,920
Before the ceremony is complete,
don't unveil it.

642
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,680
Let me help you back into the sedan chair.

643
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,280
- Come on.
- Be careful.

644
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,960
- Over there, hurry up.
- Get him.

645
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,000
- Careful.
- Watch out.

646
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,640
- Make way!
- Hurry up.

647
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,760
Right, this way.

648
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,120
Be careful with the bridal veil.

649
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,560
Hit them.

650
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,640
- This way.
- Get out of the way!

651
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,800
Help!

652
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,800
Everyone, stop fighting!

653
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,480
Both families are anxiously waiting.

654
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,320
If we miss the moment,
we'll have to pick another.

655
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,800
Stop it.

656
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,560
- Let's go
- Stop!

657
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,520
Stop fighting!

658
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,640
Don't miss the auspicious moment.
Let's go.

659
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,320
- Go
- Let's go.

660
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,440
- Master.
- Matron of honor.

661
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,560
Matron of honor.

662
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,480
- Matron of honor.
- Hurry up and get in.

663
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,280
Why are you coming out?

664
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,080
Hurry up. Let's go.

665
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,800
- How can there be such rude people…
- Hurry.

666
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,560
- …in this world?
- Yes.

667
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,880
- How dare you!
- You are outrageous.

668
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,360
Master.

669
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,480
All the relatives
are all waiting for the ceremony.

670
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,680
It would be a pity to delay it.

671
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,040
- No way, I must sue them.
- Let's go.

672
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,160
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

673
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,440
- You are outrageous.
- Sir.

674
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,560
Alright, let's go.

675
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,280
Master, that punch you threw
just now was amazing.

676
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,520
This silly girl.

677
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,880
Mom.

678
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,000
You've been busy all day. I've made you
a bowl of dumplings.

679
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,000
Please eat some.

680
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,200
Why haven't you gone back yet?
Yangxi is coming to urge you.

681
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,560
I told him to go back to pack up
and move back here early tomorrow.

682
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,840
Move back here?
Did you two have an argument?

683
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,880
Mother-in-law insists on returning
to the hometown.

684
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,200
There are no elders at home.

685
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,560
We're only separated by a wall.
I might as well move back.

686
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,720
Besides,

687
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,960
Yangxi said he marries into the Li family.

688
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,480
It's only right for him to come over
and take care of you.

689
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,640
Seriously?

690
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,600
Of course.

691
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,240
How about we all come back
and stay with you?

692
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,280
Well, you all!

693
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,440
What's going on?

694
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,240
After Leshan gets married,
you must feel a bit lonely.

695
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,280
We sisters have decided
to take turns coming back to live here.

696
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,720
How about one in turn for a month?

697
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,840
- Is it?
- Nonsense!

698
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,040
No married daughter comes back
to live with her mother all the time.

699
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,200
If you come back,
what about your husbands?

700
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,360
Your in-laws will complain.

701
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,600
Mom.

702
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,960
We grew up without a father
and have been raised by you.

703
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,960
If we forget our own mother
once we are married,

704
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,920
who would want
such ruthless daughter-in-laws?

705
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,840
Exactly.

706
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,920
I'll go home and fulfill my filial duties.
If Fan Lianghan dares to object,

707
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,400
I'll beat him.

708
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,320
Next month, I'll bring Joy back
to keep you company, okay?

709
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,920
No need.

710
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,840
Mom, of all virtues,
filial piety is the greatest.

711
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,520
In the Song, all mothers without sons

712
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,880
have been supported by daughters.

713
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,880
If we don't even have this right,
we don't deserve to be your daughters.

714
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,000
Exactly.

715
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,400
Good.

716
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,160
The house is all ready.

717
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,600
Every night,

718
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,760
I go around each room

719
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,800
and clean them all thoroughly.

720
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,240
Okay, Mom. It's getting cold. Eat now.

721
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,400
- Eat now.
- Eat up.

722
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,000
I wonder how Leshan is doing.

723
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,920
I hope this He Guangyuan

724
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,680
makes fewer mistakes tonight.

725
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,240
If he annoys Leshan,

726
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,760
then he has to suffer tonight.

727
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,200
Why are you like this?

728
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,080
That's the truth.

729
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,680
- Eat up.
- Mom.

730
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,720
YANG MANSION

731
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,880
Li Leshan, how are you?

732
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,560
Do you still remember me?

733
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,320
You're a woman,
so I won't make things difficult for you.

734
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,920
As long as you kneel and beg for mercy,
swearing to be my maid for three years,

735
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,920
to help me change clothes,
grind ink, and serve by my bed,

736
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,120
then I will save your sister.
How about that?

737
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,600
Master, I beg you to save my sister.

738
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,200
I'm willing to be a maid.
Whatever will do.

739
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,240
Li Leshan, you promised me so
when you begged me

740
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,440
to save your fourth sister.

741
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,000
I went through great hardships
to destroy the thieves' den,

742
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,400
kill the bandits,

743
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,960
and save your fourth sister.

744
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,160
But you've hidden
in the Li house ever since,

745
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,040
going against your promise.

746
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,400
Now, I don't need you to bother coming.

747
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,040
I'll personally bring you here
in a bridal sedan chair. How about it?

748
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,920
You exchanged the bridal sedan chair?

749
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,800
Yes, I did.

750
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,840
Yang Xian.

751
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,480
You bullied me, such a vulnerable girl,
and took advantage of me.

752
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,920
The Shen and Li families
brought you generous gifts as thanks.

753
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,120
You thought it's not enough.

754
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,600
Marriage is an important event.

755
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,160
This affects my whole life,
yet you dare pull such a trick.

756
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,080
Yang Xian.

757
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,760
You are arrogant, despicable,

758
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,280
inhuman, and lowly.

759
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,560
You are the one who's ungrateful.
How dare you scold me here!

760
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,160
I don't want jewels as thanks.
I want you to keep your promise.

761
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,160
Now, we've bowed to the heaven and earth
and completed the wedding ceremony.

762
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,080
We are a couple now.

763
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,480
- You can't regret it.
- You!

764
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,080
The wedding night
is a rare beautiful night.

765
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,800
Have a cup of wedding wine with me.

766
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,960
From now on,

767
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,560
if you respect me

768
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,120
and serve me well,

769
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,360
then I will spare you.

770
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,880
If you dare to lose your temper,
speak disrespectfully,

771
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,600
or provoke me again…

772
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,800
Li Leshan, how dare you hit me?

773
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,160
I…

774
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,880
Li Leshan, how dare you hit me?

775
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,600
- You shrew!
- You heinous man!

776
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,640
I…

777
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,120
How dare you mess with me?

778
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,680
I must beat you until you crawl.

779
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,680
- I--
- Go away.

780
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,600
You heinous man!

781
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,320
What's wrong?

782
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,480
Xian.

783
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,600
- Xian.
- Don't come over.

784
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,640
MADAM LUO

785
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,120
YANG DEMAO

786
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,400
I am Li Leshan from Sifu House
on Pan Restaurant Street.

787
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,000
On my wedding day,

788
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,880
your son snatched me away,

789
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,080
forcing me to be his wife.

790
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,880
Hurry and inform the Li family.
If you dare delay,

791
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,920
- I'll take his life.
- Don't.

792
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,360
- Mom.
- Mom.

793
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,480
- Go to the Li family.
- Mom.

794
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,840
Go!

795
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,920
Don't act rashly.

796
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,840
Crying, that's all you know.

797
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,040
Your son has caused big trouble.

798
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,240
The Yan's daughter is from a distinguished
family, virtuous and upright,

799
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,400
praised by everyone in Bianjing.

800
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,960
What is there for him to nitpick?

801
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,800
He insisted on switching to a shrewish

802
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,960
and fierce girl
who pays no respect to her elders.

803
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,920
He just wants to drive me crazy.

804
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,960
It's not my son who made the switch.
It was the heavens' doing.

805
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,400
You are the cousin of Concubine Yang,

806
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,080
yet you can't even deal
with such an ignorant girl.

807
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,240
Just have the servant go tie her up.
Wouldn't that solve everything?

808
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,000
You stupid woman!

809
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,320
The Li family is a humble family,

810
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,240
but her fourth brother-in-law

811
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,240
is Shen Huizhao,
the ruthless judge of Kaifeng Court.

812
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,880
And her eldest sister got married
to the third-ranked scholar Du Yangxi.

813
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,600
Who are they?

814
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,840
They are the intimate officials
to His Majesty.

815
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,200
If the Li family accused us
to His Majesty,

816
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,160
even with Concubine Yang as a guarantor,

817
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,800
we can't escape the punishment.

818
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,840
But she has already
married into our family.

819
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,560
She has become one of us.

820
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,840
Not to mention
upholding women's virtues and integrity.

821
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,840
She wouldn't accuse us.

822
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,920
If she makes a scene,

823
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,320
she'd be so ashamed.

824
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,320
You are a faithful widow,

825
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,920
having shame and dignity.

826
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,600
But that shrew
doesn't fear being humiliated.

827
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,840
Enough. Stop it.

828
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,200
Chaozong.

829
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,440
Father, I have already asked someone
to go to the Li family.

830
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,920
Of course, you must go to the Li family.

831
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,080
Prepare a generous gift.
You go visit the He family.

832
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,480
Also, send someone
to the palace immediately

833
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,040
and ask for instructions from the Consort.

834
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,680
