EPISODE 36

2
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,280
UNIVERSE IN HARMONY

3
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,000
Your Majesty.

4
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,080
I have been deeply concerned

5
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,120
about the prolonged drought
in the capital.

6
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,680
Minister Cui invited seven fairy maidens

7
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,000
from Penglai Immortal Island

8
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,520
to pray for rain for the common people.

9
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,280
I rejoice today

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,480
thanks to your efforts, dear Minister.

11
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,680
I do not wish to enjoy the pleasure alone.

12
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,680
Hence, I hastily summoned you here.

13
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,480
Now, the people are prosperous
and peace reigns over the land.

14
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,320
All thanks to Your Majesty's benevolence
and grace bestowed upon the people,

15
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm graced with Your Majesty's favor

16
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,960
and rewarded with a noble title
and generous emoluments.

17
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,880
I am overwhelmed with gratitude.

18
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,080
It is the fortune of the seven beauties

19
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,880
to serve at Your Majesty's banquet.

20
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,800
I dare not take credit.

21
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,240
Two thousand young boys performing dances.

22
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,840
Seven ladies praying for rain.

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,400
Mobilizing the masses
and oppressing the common people.

24
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,200
These are all your grand doings.

25
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,640
Your Majesty, please calm down.

26
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,400
When the people heard
of the birthday for Your Majesty,

27
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,640
- they were overjoyed and everyone--
- Minister Cui.

28
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,520
Did the beauties you captured
in your manor come here willingly?

29
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,080
Were the children who are beaten, scolded,

30
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,640
and kidnapped by you
coming here to perform willingly?

31
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,120
Strigidae,
you've taken my young ones away.

32
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,800
You've also destroyed my nest
in stormy weather.

33
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,440
I cry and wail to no avail.

34
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,360
The song "Strigidae"

35
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,360
tells us your selfish motives.
In the name of celebrating,

36
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,720
you kidnapped children

37
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,600
and abducted the womenfolk.

38
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,520
This song is sung throughout the land.

39
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,800
Everyone is cursing His Majesty for
exhausting people and wasting resources.

40
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,520
You have caused His Majesty much distress.

41
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,880
Your Majesty,

42
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,840
a nun in religious cultivation,

43
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,480
how could she be in the palace

44
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,080
and dressed in such a manner?

45
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,560
This outfit I'm wearing

46
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,360
is all thanks to the "generosity"
of Minister Cui.

47
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,000
Your Majesty, you must not
listen to the slander of women.

48
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,800
Someone must be framing me on purpose.

49
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,160
I implore Your Majesty to see the truth.

50
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,040
The Cui family
scours all over for beauties.

51
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,560
Even the female Taoists
who went down the mountain

52
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,880
to beg for alms were captured.

53
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,080
The guy who sent me in today
didn't investigate properly.

54
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,760
That guy is you, Lord Cui, isn't it?

55
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,240
Your Majesty, Cui acts treacherously under
guise of loyalty, deceiving the public.

56
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,240
It must be my own bizarre experience

57
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,080
that is the heavenly deities
who saw through his treachery,

58
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,360
intending to use me
as a mouthpiece to admonish the king.

59
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,840
- You…
- I have also heard among the common folk.

60
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,440
Minister Cui often consorts
with the inner eunuchs of the palace,

61
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,760
deceiving the emperor,
and disregarding his superiors.

62
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,560
Even the memorials sent from all over
must first pass before his eyes.

63
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,400
Anything he wishes
Your Majesty not to hear,

64
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,680
no one dares
to pass on the news to the palace.

65
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,160
If Your Majesty does not believe it,

66
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,440
you may summon your ministers
one by one for questioning

67
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,160
to see if there is anything else
he is hiding from Your Majesty.

68
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,280
- Your Majesty.
- Commander Zhang.

69
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

70
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,520
Issue a decree.

71
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,520
Yes.

72
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,000
General. Lord Shen's carriages have
approached the suburbs of the capital.

73
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,920
Good.

74
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,280
Cui is normally arrogant and domineering.

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,440
When he gains Your Majesty's favor,

76
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,560
no one dares to interject.

77
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,480
But once a mistake is made,

78
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,520
we won't be his only enemy.

79
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,600
If things really go smoothly,

80
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,160
I'm afraid before dawn, Your Majesty
would summon me to the palace.

81
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,600
I need to return
to the posthouse to prepare,

82
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,120
so I can add
another piece of firewood

83
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,600
to this stove fire.

84
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,920
Be cautious and on guard.

85
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,640
Rest assured.

86
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,200
It's the third watch of the night.

87
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,000
I think the guard of the woodshed
should be dozing off as well.

88
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,400
My lady, let's go take a look together.

89
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,160
Let's go.

90
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,680
This way.

91
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,000
That woman has run away.

92
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,560
Stop her.

93
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Catch her.

94
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,560
Over there. Stop her.

95
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,960
Stop her from that side.
Don't let her run away.

96
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,880
Hurry up.

97
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,480
Quick, catch her.

98
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,880
Good dog hole.

99
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,280
Exactly.

100
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,760
I specifically ordered to widen it.

101
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,640
Embezzle military pay.

102
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,600
I truly did not know

103
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,840
you had such audacity.

104
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,120
Your Majesty,
I dare not deceive in the slightest.

105
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,920
According to custom, the rewards
dispatched to Fuzhou by the imperial court

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,280
are transported
by the Linfu Area Military Bureau.

107
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,760
But ever since Cui Jizhong assumed office,

108
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,680
let alone a cotton-padded coat
for the soldiers,

109
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,880
they have not even
seen a single grain of millet.

110
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,320
Your Majesty,

111
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,520
considering how the She family
is entrenched in Fuzhou,

112
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,240
firmly controlling the northwest,

113
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,320
monopolizing military
and political power of the whole state,

114
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,040
known as an imperial official,
but in reality, a feudal prince,

115
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,160
the imperial court has established
the Linfu Area Military Bureau.

116
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,640
Firstly, to repel enemies in the north
and provide support to Fuzhou in the west.

117
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,200
Secondly, to manage the three areas
of Lin, Fu, and Feng,

118
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,320
assisting the administration
of the three prefectures.

119
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,040
The court did send troops and horses,

120
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,200
but they were viewed by the She family
as a hindrance from the imperial court,

121
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,280
creating enmity at every turn.

122
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,200
Fuzhou, full of mountains and ridges,
is rugged and difficult to traverse,

123
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,280
relying entirely on porters to shoulder
and carry the military provisions.

124
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,320
And with enemy troops
frequently harassing them,

125
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,200
those transporting
grain and forage to Fuzhou,

126
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,760
hardly one in ten arrives.

127
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,360
How can others be blamed?

128
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,040
The She family

129
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,120
harbors deep-seated hatred towards me,
who is in charge of military horses,

130
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,160
thus fabricating accusations
of embezzling military pay

131
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,160
and creating lies
that lead to military disasters.

132
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,480
Not only slandering the loyal and good,

133
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,400
questioning the court's strategy,

134
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,200
but also harboring disloyal intentions.

135
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,080
Your Majesty, I have
both testimonial and physical evidence.

136
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,200
All fabricated by your family.

137
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,880
If there was embezzlement of provisions,

138
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,280
then on Hedong Road, how dare

139
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,880
the Commission for Pacification
and Governance and Transport Envoy

140
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,360
remain silent?

141
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,480
The officials sent to the northwest
by the imperial court, are they corrupt?

142
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,840
In all the land,

143
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,040
is it only your She family
who are the loyal officials?

144
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,920
Your Majesty,

145
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,760
my evidence
is right outside the palace gate.

146
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,880
All right.

147
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,200
Let me think about it some more.

148
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,800
UNIVERSE IN HARMONY

149
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,120
Your Majesty, the Kaifeng Court official,
Shen Huizhao, requests an audience.

150
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,280
Summon him.

151
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,320
Yes.

152
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,160
Your Majesty, I obeyed the imperial order
to discreetly proceed to the northwest

153
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,920
to investigate the case of Yuan Qing
who was murdered by bandits.

154
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,080
Yuan Qing left behind
a blood letter before his death.

155
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,320
But before it could be presented,
he was already killed.

156
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,320
The evidence and the memorial
were both kept by Yuan Qing's family,

157
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,440
hidden inside a coffin.

158
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,880
Thus, narrowly escaping
the murderer's search.

159
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,040
Who is the suspect?

160
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,720
The details within,
Your Majesty will understand upon seeing.

161
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,360
BLOOD LETTER

162
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,600
Yuan Qing states in his memorial,

163
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,080
Cui Jizhong,
who's in charge of military affairs,

164
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,760
has been embezzling provisions for years.

165
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,800
The She family compensated
with their own salaries.

166
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,440
Even going so far as to sell
their properties to reward the troops.

167
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,720
Resulting in unbearable
accumulated deficits over the years.

168
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,040
During Cui Jizhong's tenure,

169
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,520
he bullied the tribal people
and abducted local women.

170
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,520
The tribal people
rose in rebellion several times.

171
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,840
Fuzhou citizens
could no longer bear the harassment.

172
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,160
Lord Cui, the steadfast official
whom Your Majesty trusts and values,

173
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
could he also have been
bribed by my She Family?

174
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,680
Your Majesty.

175
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,240
- My lady.
- This way.

176
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,000
My lady.

177
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,480
Come.

178
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,440
Take a seat.

179
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,640
Wait here. I have a rare gift for you.

180
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,880
This is for me?

181
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,840
This pouch of gold beads

182
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,920
is enough to buy ten singers.

183
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,040
If I give them all to you,

184
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,520
how will my lady repay me?

185
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,240
What do you intend to do?

186
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,520
With my talent and ability,

187
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,920
living beneath others
is just a temporary measure.

188
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,760
Given the current state of the Cui family,

189
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,280
we can't stay in Bianjing any longer.

190
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,480
If I go to Jiangling
to seek refuge with my uncle,

191
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,800
I can buy lands
and become a wealthy landlord.

192
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,040
Are you willing to share
in the prosperity with me?

193
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,160
Only me?

194
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,080
Then what about
your family business in Bianjing?

195
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,120
Don't you have

196
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,240
a dear aunt?

197
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,840
What dear aunt?

198
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
Just an old woman
who guards the door for me.

199
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,280
Such an encumbrance,

200
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,760
this old hag.

201
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,640
I get annoyed just by looking at her

202
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,880
I will take only you to buy a big mansion.

203
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,800
We'll get you new hairpins
and hire maids again.

204
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,960
Gold, silver, and jewels
for you to choose from.

205
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,880
You rebellious little thief.

206
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,440
You double-dealer.

207
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,320
- Murder!
- Get out of here!

208
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,440
If it were not for you

209
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,800
using my son to blackmail me,

210
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,520
I would never associate with you.

211
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,040
You still have to provide for my old age.

212
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,560
You liar.
The gold obtained from the Yang family…

213
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,360
Where's the gold? Give it to me.

214
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,560
- The gold.
- Give it to me.

215
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,360
You steal my gold. Let go!

216
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,920
- Give it to me.
- Let go!

217
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,000
And now you're turning the tables on me.

218
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,800
Where have you hidden it?

219
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,000
What kind of act are you putting on?
I know about your plots to rob and murder.

220
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,840
I'm going to the officials.
I'll have you punished for capital offense.

221
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,280
Punish me for the capital offense?
I will kill you first.

222
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
- I will kill you!
- Stop.

223
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,920
Punish me for the capital offense?
I dare you to try.

224
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,400
Die.

225
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,560
<i>Dumped the corpse into the river.</i>

226
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,200
<i>Neither gods nor ghosts will notice.</i>

227
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,560
<i>When the city gates open</i>
<i>at the fourth watch,</i>

228
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,960
<i>I will leave this place of trouble.</i>

229
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,200
<i>Even if that Yang</i>
<i>has influence reaching to the heavens,</i>

230
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,320
<i>in the vast sea of people,</i>
<i>he won't be able to find any trace.</i>

231
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,120
Who is it? Who is playing tricks?

232
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,840
I'm telling you, I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not afraid of you.

233
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,360
Master Yang,

234
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,520
you went to great lengths to set a trap,

235
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,120
and yet he escaped so easily.

236
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,400
The original plan
was to pit the two against each other,

237
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,280
forcing Ms. Chen to testify in court.

238
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,160
Who would have thought he is so malicious,

239
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,640
plotting yet another murder?

240
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,280
Even if he escapes
to the ends of the earth this time,

241
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,000
he cannot escape the charge of murder.

242
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,040
- Qiansheng.
- Yes.

243
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,680
You two, follow me.

244
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,000
Madam Tao is quite formidable.

245
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,040
In just three meetings, you bewitched him
so he's completely disoriented.

246
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,800
Rather than fall out with his associates,
he chose to take you.

247
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
What method did you use?

248
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,080
The rosy skeleton way I've chosen to go on

249
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,640
is easy to start

250
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,280
but hard to get rid of.

251
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,200
You will need to empty your pockets,
have yourself ruined to get out.

252
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,960
It isn't any respectable skill.

253
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,200
My lady, it's better not to know.

254
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,600
Now that the matter is finished,
I shall take my leave.

255
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,640
How much did you pay her?

256
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,680
She is a famous courtesan in Hangzhou.

257
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,960
Wealth is hardly compelling.

258
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,120
On the way back to Bianjing,

259
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,400
Madam Tao was betrayed
by her faithless cousin

260
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,840
and sold for a trifling sum.

261
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,080
I happened to pass by and had her saved.

262
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,320
When she heard
I sought to avenge my family,

263
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,440
she offered to help
without asking for a penny.

264
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,640
Indeed, an extraordinary woman of honor.

265
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,600
You plotted to drive a wedge
between those two.

266
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,880
What if they don't fall for it?

267
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,760
That's because you don't understand
the greedy nature of these two.

268
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,920
A small gold ingot

269
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,160
can make them turn against each other

270
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,880
as if it's a matter of life and death.

271
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,720
That Aunt Chen secretly plotted with
others to scheme for Yang's assets.

272
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,560
She set fire to the ancestral hall
with the intent to take lives.

273
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,320
She deserves death a thousand times over.

274
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,800
But she should not have died this way.

275
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,520
They committed evils, but you couldn't
punish them out of compassion.

276
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,280
In the past three years,

277
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,480
you have indeed changed a lot.

278
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,240
My lady, please come with me.

279
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,280
She is still alive.

280
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,880
Her acupuncture points
were temporarily sealed with needles.

281
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,040
It's difficult to detect immediately.
She's no different from being half-dead.

282
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,640
Jiang Chaozong was so terrified
that his soul scattered.

283
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,840
Where would he even begin
to closely examine the truth?

284
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,760
Come on. Carry it up.

285
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,440
My lord, she has fainted.

286
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,040
But she is still alive.

287
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,560
Shall we save her or not?

288
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,520
My lord, my lady.

289
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,120
I know I was wrong.

290
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,640
Spare me. I won't dare to do it again.

291
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,360
Spare me.

292
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,800
I was trafficked several times
since childhood,

293
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,720
helpless and adrift like duckweed.

294
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,240
That's why I regard money as my life.

295
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,680
I only schemed for money.
I never harmed a life.

296
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,760
It's all that, that disaster.

297
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,920
He forced me.

298
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,760
I had no such intention.

299
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,280
You must believe me.

300
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,280
Leshan, at the beginning,

301
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,800
I didn't start the fire
at the ancestral hall.

302
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Believe me just this once.

303
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,640
Jiang Chaozong is greed personified.

304
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,120
Greed leads to fatal consequences.

305
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,160
The testimony of Madam Tao
from Zhu Silang Tavern is the evidence.

306
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,440
Tomorrow, the court
will issue a warrant for the capture.

307
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,200
Let that scoundrel
suffer the hardships of being destitute.

308
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,920
Naturally, someone will apprehend him
and bring him to justice.

309
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,960
When the time comes,
are you willing to testify in court?

310
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,320
I am willing.

311
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,120
Whoever plots a murder shall be sentenced
to three years of imprisonment.

312
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,840
Those who injure others are to be
sentenced to hanging. Are you injured?

313
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,040
Here, here.

314
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,640
I am covered in cuts and bruises.

315
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,600
That utterly ruthless person.

316
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,760
I fainted, and he still wanted
to take my life.

317
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,200
He is the one who deserves to die.

318
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,080
Spare me.

319
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,320
I was wrong. Please let me go.

320
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,920
Jiang Chaozong is the chief culprit.

321
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,040
You're also an accomplice.

322
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,480
But considering you were just an accessory
and are willing to testify in court,

323
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,760
you may be spared the death penalty,
but you cannot escape punishment.

324
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,760
Once the lawsuit is settled,

325
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,720
I need a lower-class maid on my ship.

326
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,920
I'll send you to scrub the deck
for three years.

327
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,680
After three years, you will be set free.

328
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,040
This is your retribution.

329
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,280
Thank you, my lord.

330
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,880
Take her away.

331
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,480
If you watched as Chen Xiaogu drowned,

332
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,960
this further confirms
Jiang Chaozong's serious crime of murder.

333
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,520
Only then will your vengeance
be satisfied with full contentment.

334
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,120
Originally I wanted
to throw her back into the river,

335
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,000
but considering my lady would not like it,
I could not do such a thing.

336
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,960
I want to grow old with you
and live a life of peace and stability.

337
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,840
Then I must accumulate more good deeds.

338
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,960
Must not dare to do evil.

339
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,240
That Jiang Chaozong
is not only your adversary,

340
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,000
but also my nemesis.

341
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,600
I came with you only to see him
in a state of despair and misery.

342
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,160
Your revenge or kindness, evil or good
deeds, they have nothing to do with me.

343
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,000
That is your own business.

344
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm going back.

345
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,560
My lady,

346
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,600
can you truly bear to leave me behind

347
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,080
and marry that Mr. She?

348
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,840
My lady.

349
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,480
<i>I want to grow old with you</i>
<i>and live a life of peace and stability.</i>

350
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,120
<i>Then I must accumulate more good deeds.</i>
<i>Must not dare to do evil.</i>

351
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,280
My lady.

352
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,840
My lady.

353
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,160
Why are you following me again,
pestering me?

354
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,560
I still have something
very important to say.

355
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,560
What is it?

356
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,960
Speak quickly.

357
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,760
It's not respectable to be seen like this.

358
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,440
Having drifted at sea for three years,

359
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,920
I have encountered raging storms
and towering waves.

360
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,480
It nearly led to shipwreck and death.

361
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,920
I have also encountered ferocious bandits
lurking on the ship,

362
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,480
preparing to hijack the ship
and threatening my life.

363
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,720
I have endured
all kinds of hardships and dangers.

364
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,000
If you don't believe me, look.

365
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,120
It's better not to look.

366
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,680
It would startle you.

367
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,000
Who wants to look?

368
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,240
Finished?

369
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,640
Actually, not everything was bad.

370
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,520
To learn how to do business,

371
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,280
I specifically learned
the foreign language.

372
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,360
The King of Champa wanted
to invite me to be his honored guest,

373
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,680
and to marry his daughter.

374
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,200
Then, why didn't you stay
and become his son-in-law?

375
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,080
Why come back
with so much pain and difficulty?

376
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,720
With you, I don't want anyone else.

377
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,840
But you are going to marry someone else.

378
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,720
The wind and sand are harsh
in the northwest.

379
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,840
Customs are vastly different
from the Central Plains.

380
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,440
You won't be accustomed to it.

381
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,720
In time, one would get used to it.

382
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,000
Becoming the wife of a general,

383
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,320
it comes with nobility and glory.

384
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,760
Isn't that better
than being a merchant's wife?

385
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,040
The She family has been
a line of heroes for generations.

386
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,960
On the battlefield, swords and blades
are blind. The killing never ends.

387
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,560
If you become a wife of the She family,

388
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,000
you will inevitably
be anxious day and night.

389
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,280
For many years, you may guard
an empty home in loneliness.

390
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,480
Have you not heard the poem?

391
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,720
The men you dreamt of in the boudoir
might turn into bones by the riverside.

392
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,160
There must be some truth in that old poem.

393
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,280
You are cursing him?

394
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,360
Who allowed you to curse him?

395
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,560
That's not what I meant.

396
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,200
Leshan.

397
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,200
Leave. Do not come again.

398
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,240
Leave.

399
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,000
If you refuse to change your mind,
a good man from Bianjing is also fine.

400
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,200
You must not abandon
your relatives to marry far away.

401
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,560
Suffering humiliation,
calling to heaven brings no response.

402
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,600
If you refuse to listen to me,
I'll come every day.

403
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,560
Leave.

404
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,920
Leshan, why don't you respond?

405
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,360
There seemed to be some noise outside.

406
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,760
No, there wasn't.

407
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,360
Perhaps it was a cat
scampering on the rooftop.

408
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,920
You must have heard wrong.

409
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,360
Tomorrow, when Madam She comes,
help me choose one…

410
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,040
I mean,

411
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,720
a garment that is a bit more dignified.

412
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,680
- Accompany me to choose, quickly.
- I…

413
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,160
Shouhua.

414
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,080
You come out too to help me choose.

415
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,520
Have some tea.

416
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,760
- Mother.
- I dare not.

417
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,640
- Mother.
- Quick, help your mother up.

418
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,760
Please get up.

419
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,360
Mother, what are you doing?

420
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,840
Mother has always been sincere.

421
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,480
If she says she doesn't blame you,
then she really doesn't.

422
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,040
Your bowing has actually startled her.

423
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,080
It's just heaven playing tricks on people.

424
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,640
You thank me for giving you a son.

425
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,520
Actually, I should be thanking you.

426
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,400
Thank me? For what?

427
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,280
- You.
- Mother.

428
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,160
I deeply thank you
for saving his life from the water.

429
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,240
Thank you for raising him
to be both literate and martial.

430
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,400
He's talented and ambitious.

431
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,400
I also want to thank you
for being willing to give him back to me.

432
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,560
No more bowing.

433
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,160
- None of us will bow anymore.
- Alright, no bowing.

434
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,200
Alright, take a seat.

435
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,280
What's there to be afraid of?

436
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,680
- Don't be afraid.
- That's right.

437
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,880
I've long said
to seek a virtuous lady for him,

438
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,520
but he always finds ways to refuse.

439
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,360
Turns out this match

440
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,920
was destined by heaven.

441
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,280
Since it's an engagement from childhood,

442
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,320
and raised by his own mother too,

443
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,440
that must be right.

444
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,520
They should indeed marry early,

445
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,520
settling one of our concerns.

446
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,720
I'll send a letter to Fuzhou right away,

447
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,520
letting them know this great news.

448
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,800
I wonder what Fan's thoughts are on this.

449
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,520
Since my mothers have decided,

450
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,160
then, as a son,

451
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,280
how dare I disobey the order.

452
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,840
Good, good.

453
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,560
Then it's settled.
I'll have someone check the almanac

454
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,760
to choose an auspicious date.

455
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,280
Why are you leaving?

456
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,160
Buzz off.

457
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,360
Run faster.

458
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,960
The criminal is right ahead.

459
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,720
This way.

460
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,040
Heaven hasn't doomed me.

461
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,080
Go.

462
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,880
What a cunning man.
Knowing we are in a hurry to purchase,

463
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,280
he deliberately raises the price.

464
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,840
No rush. Let's look elsewhere.

465
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
I thought my own eyes were deceived.

466
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,040
Turns out it really is you, Qiongnu.

467
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,120
I've been thinking about you
ever since returning to Bianjing.

468
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,000
You philanderer,

469
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,680
why would you be thinking about Qiongnu?

470
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,120
Leshan.

471
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,520
Already broke one of your legs.
Was that still not enough?

472
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,640
Better not to mention this matter.

473
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,000
Now that it's brought up,

474
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,040
let's settle the score properly.

475
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,000
It was clearly you who took the jade comb
with your own hands.

476
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,640
It was obviously mutual consent.

477
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,200
Then you turned around
and asked others to break my leg.

478
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,200
Today, even if it takes my life,
I won't let you off easy.

479
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,360
You.

480
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,000
Wielding the Chai family's jade comb
to swindle and deceive,

481
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,520
and yet you dare to talk big here.

482
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,000
If you have business today,
just come to me.

483
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,640
Let go of Leshan.

484
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,600
So she can send a message?

485
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,400
None of you can leave today.

486
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,520
Take them.

487
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,080
If she didn't love showing off,
who would dare come up and entice?

488
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,280
She's just a woman lusting after
the wealth of my Liang family,

489
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,320
yet pretending to be
a virtuous and chaste woman.

490
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,560
I…

491
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,080
If it weren't for your filthy mouth
and slanderous tongue,

492
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,000
who would be willing
to dirty their own hands?

493
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,280
A filthy beast in human form,
even worse than pigs.

494
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,080
If we sliced off your stinking flesh,
even dogs would probably disdain them.

495
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,360
How dare you slander Qiongnu?

496
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,640
Brother.

497
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,400
- Huaiyi.
- Yes.

498
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,920
Give him 30 lashes and send him back.

499
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,400
Tell the Liang Family
that it was I who laid hands.

500
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,400
Since they won't discipline their son,

501
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,200
I might as well
teach him a lesson for them.

502
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,000
Should there be a next time,

503
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,600
- it will be time to break the hands.
- Yes.

504
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,240
Get up.

505
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,760
You're alright?

506
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,240
And you? Are you hurt anywhere?

507
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,080
Relax, I'm fine.

508
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,880
I'm not going in.

509
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,520
I'll just say a few words
with you outside.

510
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,040
The events that happened today,

511
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,320
you've seen them too.

512
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,400
I feared my dowry was too modest

513
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,240
to find a good match.

514
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,240
And yet I was greedy for wealth and gain.

515
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,960
Thus, I accepted his jade comb

516
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
and was almost deceived,

517
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,600
ruining the reputation of the Li family.

518
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,840
Mr. She,

519
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,800
though we knew each other at a young age,

520
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,600
it's been years since we last met,

521
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,440
the childhood marriage arrangement
might as well be void.

522
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,480
You needn't demean yourself

523
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,200
by compromising to make this whole.

524
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,000
To marry a vain woman like me,

525
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,560
this would only
invite ridicule from others.

526
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,600
For you,

527
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,080
it's not good.

528
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,600
Two days ago,

529
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,120
Kangning came to see me

530
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,800
and explained the ins and outs
of the matter to me completely.

531
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,600
Qiongnu,

532
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,120
I still have some important things to say.

533
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,400
No need.

534
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,600
I will personally persuade Mother.

535
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,400
There's no marriage arrangement anymore.

536
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,320
Over this past year,

537
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,200
the border has become much more peaceful.

538
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,040
Younger brother Min
is gradually able to hold his own.

539
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,440
The heavy burden on my shoulders

540
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,480
can also be put down now.

541
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,560
I was never
the She family's noble general.

542
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,760
In the future,

543
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,360
I am just the proprietor
of a small teahouse.

544
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,600
And you

545
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,000
would at most
be the landlady of a teahouse.

546
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,960
All that glory, wealth, and power,

547
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,880
those are all but shadows.

548
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,880
I only ask you one question.

549
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,800
Even so,

550
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,120
would you still be willing to marry me?

551
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,960
Qiongnu,

552
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,000
when you ate cold noodles,

553
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,800
did anyone still
share lotus root with you?

554
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,240
My lotus root is also for you.

555
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,280
Fan, why did you only just arrive?

556
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,560
Sorry.

557
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,160
I'm late.

558
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,360
You've suffered a lot over these years.

559
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,280
Move.

560
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,360
- Here you are.
- Okay.

561
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,640
It's a bit large. Needs to be altered.

562
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,720
Fuhui, all these have been ordered.

563
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,480
Sisters, look.

564
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,960
This box

565
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,560
is too dazzling.

566
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,600
Don't know who chose these treasures.

567
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,920
Someone chose them
to curry favor with her.

568
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,960
Eagerly brought them,

569
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,200
now I get to benefit from it.

570
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,640
That sea business is not easy.

571
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,680
His life was at risk.

572
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,840
He has lost his dignity for you.

573
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,440
He's endured beatings and scoldings,
even became servant.

574
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,680
Even condemned prisoners
have hope for an amnesty.

575
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,200
Are you truly indifferent?

576
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,360
Eloped and then left
without saying goodbye.

577
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,960
Now that he finally returned,

578
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,440
he still sneaks around.
Leshan is hard to placate.

579
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,520
In my opinion,
have my brother-in-law take a look,

580
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,080
choose a good one, and get married.

581
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,600
Let him give up the thought soon.

582
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,240
In the future, when he becomes
the Champa King's son-in-law,

583
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,440
he has to thank Leshan for sparing him.

584
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,000
Kangning.

585
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,480
Always youthful in temperament.

586
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,880
Can't bear to part again?

587
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,280
If you can't bear it, just say so.

588
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,360
What shame to fear
before one's own sisters?

589
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,800
Back then, in the Yang family,
how much humiliation did you endure?

590
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,760
And for three years,
how much ridicule from others?

591
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,000
We have seen all that.

592
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,360
Merely procrastinating
is not a long-term solution.

593
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,320
Decisiveness is needed
for the major matter of marriage.

594
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,600
In the end, can one get by or not,

595
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,400
you give a definite answer today.

596
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,120
I ask for your help

597
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,560
to help me vent this anger.

598
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,000
Master Fan?

599
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,040
Tie him up.

600
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,400
Let's go.

601
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,120
Let's go.

602
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,760
Leshan.

603
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,840
Oh, Lord Yang.

604
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,400
You said it yourself at the beginning

605
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,960
that you'd only marry me if the Li family
came for you with a sedan chair.

606
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,920
Today is the day
the Li family fulfills the promise.

607
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,840
How does that feel?

608
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,720
My lady hasn't forgotten the old one
and wishes to grow old together.

609
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,920
I am overwhelmed by the favor
and eternally grateful.

610
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,280
You may hit or scold, it's all okay.

611
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,440
Why go to the trouble
of making a fool of me like this?

612
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,120
You can snatch a bride in broad daylight.

613
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,440
Why can't I knock the bridegroom
unconscious at night?

614
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,000
Your Yang family can use your power
to force a marriage.

615
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,440
Why can't I let you ride in a sedan chair,

616
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,600
putting on airs
before the people of Bianjing?

617
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,800
Knowing there's give and take,
grudges settle, debts are repaid.

618
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,880
Thus achieving a harmonious marriage
and endearing love for a lifetime, right?

619
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,040
What my lady says is very true.

620
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,640
Previously, it was all my fault.

621
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,920
I'm here to apologize to my lady.

622
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,840
Apologize again.

623
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,200
Apologize yet again.

624
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,280
My lady.

625
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,560
This should suffice, right?

626
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,280
Hiding your whereabouts
and not visiting once.

627
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,120
Indulging the sworn sister's
disrespectful remarks. Two wrong deeds.

628
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,600
If you wish the wedding night,

629
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,280
- take this hit from me first.
- This could be fatal.

630
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,680
Mother-in-law, save me!

631
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,480
Save me!

632
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,680
My good son-in-law.

633
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,240
Get up.

634
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,960
My birthday is still next month.

635
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,520
You're kneeling too early.

636
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,640
Get up quickly.

637
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,080
Happy birthday. We pray
for your longevity like the evergreens.

638
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,800
Wishing you wealth, health, and youth.

639
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,320
Good, good.

640
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,000
The bright moon
reflects on a pond of lotus.

641
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,160
You are as wise as Jiang Ziya. The sun
and moon last forever around you.

642
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,240
- Up now.
- Come, Joy.

643
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,760
Such a good girl.

644
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,920
Wishing longevity,
a banquet unfolds in splendor.

645
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,560
Picking up incense,
it feels as if made of jade.

646
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,960
Picking up the cup,
it feels like gold in the wine.

647
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,160
Wishing longevity, a life
as enduring as the heavens and earth.

648
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,040
Good.

649
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,720
Mother, live long and prosper.

650
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,880
The pine and cedar trees
from here grow lush and green,

651
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,560
while the black rabbit scurries away
in a hurried, rattling run.

652
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,560
Good.

653
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,760
Joy.

654
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,600
Grandma, wishing you
fortune and longevity.

655
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,640
Joy, good girl.

656
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,240
Come, pay respects to Grandma.

657
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,440
- Let's go.
- Go.

658
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,960
Come on.

659
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,480
- Son.
- Daughter-in-law.

660
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,720
Today we come to wish you longevity.

661
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,040
Wishing you a countless lifespan,
as constant as the moon

662
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,280
and as rising as the sun.

663
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,120
Praying to the immortals, wishing you
prosperity for a thousand springs.

664
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,400
May your household flourish.

665
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,880
To live as long as the sun and the moon?
Then I would become an old demon.

666
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,920
- Wishing Mother…
- Wishing Mother-in-law…

667
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,720
happiness, longevity, and health.

668
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,520
Madam, the kids caught a cold.

669
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,480
Once recovered, they'll greet you.

670
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,520
Good.

671
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,960
Cousin, where is your birthday gift?

672
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,480
What's the rush? It's coming up.

673
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,280
Haode, Leshan, are you done yet?

674
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,520
Coming.

675
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,960
Joy, look at that.

676
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,920
Madam, I originally
wanted to make one in gold,

677
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,040
but Kangning said
that would lack sincerity.

678
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,080
Gifts of gold and silver
can be sent every month.

679
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,120
For birthday, it must be made by hand.

680
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,960
The sons-in-law all kneaded dough
together to make longevity peaches.

681
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,560
Kangning, Haode, and Leshan
stayed up for a whole night

682
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,640
and oversaw the progress.

683
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,960
Mom, please try some.

684
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,200
See if it is spongy enough
to meet your standards.

685
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,960
If it's not good, I'll have them redo it.

686
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,320
Haode is right.

687
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,320
Madam, please have a taste.

688
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,720
Come on.

689
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,160
Made really well.

690
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,200
Yes.

691
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,120
Look.

692
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,160
Joy, look.

693
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,320
There are so many.

694
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,040
Didn't this take all night to make?

695
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,360
Best wishes to you, Mother.

696
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,800
May your fortune be as vast
as the waters of the Eastern sea.

697
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,680
May your longevity surpass
the evergreen pines

698
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,880
of the southern mountains.

699
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,200
May the joys of the mortal world
be endless.

700
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,720
May every year be as blissful as today.

701
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,360
Good, good.

702
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,160
You all take care.

703
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,560
I'm well as long as you all are well.

704
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,480
Madam Li, the plaque has arrived.

705
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,160
Yes, I was too absorbed in joy
and forgot about it.

706
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,560
Change the plaque.

707
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,800
Come.

708
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,160
After waiting for so many years,

709
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,040
finally,

710
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,800
we can hang it up.

711
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,360
LIUFU SIX LUCKS HOUSE

712
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,480
Good.

713
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,520
- Liufu House.
- Bravo.

714
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,200
Great.

715
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,120
From this day forth,

716
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,120
my modest teahouse

717
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,080
will truly and genuinely have

718
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,400
six lucks. A perfect match.

719
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,680
Congratulations.

720
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,080
Congratulations.

721
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,360
Congratulations.

722
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,760
Finally, the day has come.

723
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,320
Congratulations, Madam.

724
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,720
Mother, that's wonderful.

725
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,120
Perfect.

726
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,880
Liufu House.

727
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,840
Liufu House.

728
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,040
<i>After each of you is married,</i>

729
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,560
<i>I will hang up all five lucks,</i>

730
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,200
<i>letting all of Bianjing see them.</i>

731
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,840
<i>Then, I have no regrets.</i>

732
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,000
<i>To marry you</i>

733
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,760
<i>is indeed my good fortune.</i>

734
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,040
<i>It's just that I often have doubts.</i>

735
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,640
<i>Whether I have truly</i>
<i>received heaven's pity,</i>

736
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,600
<i>bestowing upon me a man</i>

737
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,400
<i>willing to dispel the curse</i>

738
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,120
<i>that I can rely on</i>
<i>for the rest of my life.</i>

739
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,960
<i>My heart is as hard as iron.</i>

740
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,200
<i>Calculating to the utmost,</i>

741
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,160
<i>in all my life,</i>
<i>I've never known the taste of affection.</i>

742
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,440
<i>Upon meeting you,</i>

743
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,440
<i>only then did I understand</i>
<i>the emaciation of yearning.</i>

744
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,480
<i>Kangning, apart from me,</i>

745
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,080
<i>I'm afraid</i>
<i>there's no second man in this world</i>

746
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,880
<i>who truly knows how to appreciate,</i>

747
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,480
<i>cherish, and respect you.</i>

748
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,280
<i>In my childhood, at my old home</i>
<i>in Luoyang, I planted a plum tree.</i>

749
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,440
<i>If you could help me</i>
<i>break off the highest branch,</i>

750
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,480
<i>I will then marry you.</i>

751
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,400
<i>What my heart cherishes</i>
<i>is not some fresh flowers or fragrances.</i>

752
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,440
<i>Nor is it gold, jade, or jewels.</i>

753
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,840
<i>But a person.</i>

754
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,160
<i>I love him for his upright heart</i>
<i>and his open and honorableness.</i>

755
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,080
<i>I respect him for only considering</i>
<i>the principles of heaven and the laws,</i>

756
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,880
<i>not swayed by worldly sentiments.</i>

757
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,480
<i>I'm all the more fond of him</i>
<i>for not being good at currying favor.</i>

758
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,240
<i>His behavior and manners</i>
<i>are simple and sometimes comical.</i>

759
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,680
<i>I will never again</i>
<i>presumptuously drive you away.</i>

760
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,880
<i>Nor will I deceive you,</i>
<i>hide things from you, or make you sad.</i>

761
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,960
<i>You are the mistress of the Shen family.</i>

762
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,600
<i>You are my only wife.</i>

763
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,480
<i>I, Li Leshan, swear by the moon.</i>

764
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,400
<i>If you truly pass the three challenges,</i>

765
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,400
<i>then I'm willing</i>
<i>to devote myself to you for life.</i>

766
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,760
<i>If I break this promise and oath,</i>

767
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,360
<i>may I be punished with</i>
<i>the abandonment by all and loneliness,</i>

768
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,720
<i>a lifetime of widowhood.</i>

769
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,400
<i>I am not some noble general</i>
<i>from the She family.</i>

770
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,640
<i>In the future,</i>

771
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,600
<i>I'll be nothing more</i>
<i>than a small teahouse keeper.</i>

772
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,800
<i>And you</i>

773
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,680
<i>will just be a tea house's landlady.</i>

774
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,040
<i>Even so,</i>

775
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,040
<i>are you still willing to marry me?</i>
