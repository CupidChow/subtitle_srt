00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,320
EPISODE 2

2
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,280
Mom, can you believe it?

3
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,560
That pigeon-cage-like house

4
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,440
costs five strings of coins.

5
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,000
Isn't that just robbery?

6
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,000
If life is so tough,

7
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,560
we should pack up and head home.

8
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,240
Our land has been sold.

9
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,600
Mom's boasted to the neighbors.

10
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,600
She said we'll stay here from now on.

11
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,160
Going back to be teased?

12
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,280
That's true.

13
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,240
Eldest cousin was so shocked by you,

14
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,560
he's still lying crooked.

15
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,160
Even second uncle's beams got taken down.

16
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,160
Let's just lay low for a while.

17
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,840
They drained our canals,

18
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,240
tried to take our fields.

19
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,320
Crops are ruined.

20
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,040
I only scared him

21
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,160
as a warning.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,120
If you hadn't stopped me,

23
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,040
he wouldn't be so normal now!

24
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,160
Loot at you.

25
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,960
Calm down.

26
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,000
She has changed.

27
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,600
Now her morals have been cultivated.

28
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,080
Her temper is under control.

29
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,000
Don't be angry, Mom.

30
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,520
That's right.

31
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,080
Mom.

32
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,960
My approach to terrible relatives

33
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,560
might be a bit extreme.

34
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,960
It's over now.

35
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,680
Once I arrived in the capital,

36
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,040
I transformed into a lady.

37
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,160
Don't worry, Mom.

38
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,080
If someone spits at me,

39
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,880
I'll stay quiet,

40
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,200
leaving it to dry by itself.

41
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,720
Problem solved.

42
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,760
Mom.

43
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,880
No worries. You can stay at Fan's Mansion.

44
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,360
I will care for you.

45
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,840
It'll help with marriage matches
for the other sisters.

46
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,600
Brother-in-law's terrible habit

47
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,080
takes time to change.

48
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,520
Next time when he misbehaves,

49
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,840
what should Mom do about it?

50
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,760
Living under someone else's roof
feels wrong.

51
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,480
You can't do whatever you like.
Renting a place is better.

52
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,680
We can't live off our savings forever.

53
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,960
In a year,

54
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,160
the money we got for our land
will be depleted.

55
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,360
Beg on the street then?

56
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,800
Since no one agrees,

57
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,920
why don't we decide

58
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,600
like we did as kids?

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,840
Then I will decide?

60
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,560
- We are all yours.
- All yours.

61
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,240
The jackal relatives are behind us.

62
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,040
The world is uncertain in front of us.

63
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,080
So, our best bet

64
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,880
is to start a business here.

65
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,320
Work together as a family.

66
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,720
We'll be safe and comfortable.

67
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,640
But marriage worries Mom the most.

68
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
No matter what we think,

69
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,360
we have to please her.

70
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,920
Let's go.

71
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,320
Mom, marriage is up to fate,

72
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,120
not wealth.

73
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,840
Most people spend a lot on dowries.

74
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,320
We don't have much,

75
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,320
but even if we did,

76
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,960
we won't chase that trend.

77
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,680
Look at us.

78
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,800
We're charming

79
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,240
and smart.

80
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,280
Dowry or not,

81
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,120
we'll find good matches.

82
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,480
Really?

83
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,560
Yes, we sisters discussed it.

84
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,040
The house we saw,

85
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,160
we'll not rent it.

86
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,680
We'll choose a busier area

87
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,040
and start a business.

88
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,520
We can do business anywhere.

89
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,760
Why must it be here?

90
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,280
Mom,

91
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,160
renting a shop, making money,

92
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,560
that's just part of it.

93
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,800
The key…

94
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,360
Matchmakers always talk big.

95
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,040
All of them, right?

96
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,360
Second sister suffers because of it.

97
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,120
Mom,

98
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,320
would you allow that to happen to us?

99
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,080
You're right.

100
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,280
By opening our doors,
I can pick the suitors myself.

101
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,360
Great.

102
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,440
Oh.

103
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,720
Portraits. Where are the portraits?

104
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,920
Portraits?

105
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,080
I forgot to take it.

106
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,000
Oh no, this is bad.

107
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,920
- You…
- Mom.

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,920
- My portraits…
- Mom.

109
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,480
Mom!

110
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,200
- Mom, are you okay?
- Mom.

111
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,600
- Mom!
- Mom.

112
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,000
- My…
- Water!

113
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,920
- Drink some.
- Water.

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,960
Mom!

115
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,920
- Mom.
- Mom.

116
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,560
These are all good.

117
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,880
Really?

118
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,600
- Lady.
- Please make way.

119
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,520
These are all good.

120
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,040
- Let's go.
- Sir, this way.

121
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,320
Long time no see.

122
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,640
Come and see.

123
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,680
How is it?

124
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,840
These are freshly made.

125
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,600
- Of course.
- Take your time.

126
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,200
See you.

127
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
Okay.

128
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,240
FOUR LUCKS TEA HOUSE

129
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,160
Come again.

130
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,360
Do you want to try one?

131
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
The third lady of Li?

132
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,920
Mom, you have five daughters.

133
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,960
Why don't we call it Five Lucks?

134
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
What do you know?

135
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,520
The final luck

136
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,880
has not arrived yet.

137
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,040
Water surges only to overflow.

138
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,360
Full luck is easy to fall.

139
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,560
Being too lucky

140
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,200
isn't necessarily good.

141
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,120
Mom's right.

142
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,400
I think four lucks are enough.

143
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,720
Once you're all married,

144
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,000
I'll display

145
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,240
all five lucks

146
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,160
for everyone to see.

147
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,000
I like this.

148
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,520
Mom, don't worry.

149
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,400
The shop will do well here.

150
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,360
We'll use the front room for business.

151
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,600
There is a middle courtyard

152
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,920
for laundry.

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,920
We can live in the back.

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,560
We replaced all the furniture.

155
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,760
There's a back door for easy access.

156
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,800
You don't need to enter
through the front door.

157
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,840
Let's go check it out.

158
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,680
Okay.

159
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,360
A counter?

160
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,120
Opening a tea house?

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Hurry up.

162
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,920
- Come inside.
- Off to steal?

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,200
What's with this look?

164
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,120
My wife will see me.

165
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,760
If you're scared, why did you come?
Rather go back.

166
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,760
Buddy.

167
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,160
- Bro.
- Don't touch me.

168
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,400
Lately, my wife's been getting tougher.

169
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,320
Taverns, tea houses, and opera houses.

170
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,680
I can't go to any of them.

171
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,360
She kept me at home to do accounting.

172
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,880
Old managers came in for business all day.

173
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,080
I got quizzed every night.

174
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,880
If I couldn't answer,
I couldn't use the bed.

175
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,440
I slept on the couch for three days.

176
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,760
- Cousin.
- Better for you.

177
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,440
- Cousin!
- If you keep messing up,

178
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,120
you won't know
where your fabric shops are.

179
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,400
My dear cousin.

180
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,560
I feel terrible.

181
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,000
No alcohol starting yesterday.

182
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,840
She grounded me for two days.

183
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,880
If you don't help,

184
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,720
I'll suffocate.

185
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,400
I won't intervene in your family matters.

186
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,320
If you won't do anything,

187
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,760
someone else will.

188
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
You don't know

189
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,640
how tough my third sister-in-law is.

190
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,040
I feel terrible.

191
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,960
- Stop whining.
- Sir,

192
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,880
I've inquired.

193
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,320
They don't just sell tea.

194
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,200
It's more like a tavern.

195
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,680
They also sell noodles and soup.

196
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,600
They don't know the trades.

197
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,320
No proper tea house does that business.

198
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,880
Such a joke.

199
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,480
What do you know?

200
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,320
There are over a thousand tea houses.

201
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,320
Because it costs little to start,
with only one waiter,

202
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,640
anyone can run a tea house.

203
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,240
But it's also tough
as there are competitors around.

204
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,000
It is not an easy business.

205
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,240
East Street

206
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,320
starts trading at dawn.

207
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,920
The early shift workers
need a place to rest.

208
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
My tavern is situated here.

209
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,680
Tapping on the vibe and visitors,

210
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,440
they can sell cheap tea and snacks.

211
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,800
That's the smart, long-term way.

212
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,120
Wow, what's inside your head?

213
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,600
How are you so much smarter than me?

214
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,800
Help me figure out

215
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,160
how to deal with my wife.

216
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,400
Aunt's probably

217
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,640
on her way back, right?

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,920
Got it.

219
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,800
Ask my mom to help me out.

220
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,840
Deqing,

221
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,440
from today, tell everyone

222
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,560
that the early shift workers are welcome.

223
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,920
Sir,

224
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,280
our top-quality tea costs five strings

225
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,240
just for a few brews and sips.

226
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,880
Our low-grade tea costs 200 coins a catty.

227
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,240
The shop across the road

228
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,400
sells loose tea.

229
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,280
It's only 20-30 coins a catty.

230
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,280
We're not the same.

231
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
Cousin,

232
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,400
this will ruin Pan's reputation.

233
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,120
Let them have a place to rest and talk.

234
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,720
We serve 200 tea sets a day

235
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,360
at five to ten coins each.

236
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,440
That's enough.

237
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,000
I won't sell

238
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,120
the cheap tea.

239
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,920
Let the street vendors come in instead.

240
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,560
I'm not making it hard on purpose.

241
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,600
She wants to take advantage
of the location.

242
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,240
If I give her the chance

243
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,760
to steal my customers,

244
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,000
my business here

245
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,480
will be tough.

246
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,160
No wonder they opened their shop here.

247
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
That is what she's aiming for.

248
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,680
That's some trick.

249
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,720
Get up, get up, hurry!

250
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,280
Don't waste the morning.

251
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,200
My third daughter Kangning?

252
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,240
My eldest Shouhua?

253
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,960
Well…

254
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,480
Where did everyone go?

255
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,000
Mom.

256
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,840
- Mom.
- Mom.

257
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,040
The fire's too small.

258
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,480
You are early today.

259
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,720
Hurry up, Ms. Liu.

260
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,720
- Hot. Be careful.
- Okay.

261
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,960
- Let me.
- Chunlai, be careful.

262
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,640
Wake up little four Haode
and little five Leshan.

263
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,400
I'll go help too.

264
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,040
Okay, Mom.

265
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,440
These steamed buns smell great.

266
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
Haode, Leshan,

267
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,280
get up.

268
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,360
You're awake?

269
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,240
Big sis,

270
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,520
what are you doing?

271
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,480
Wash your face.
It's hot water. Be careful.

272
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,720
Let's go.

273
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,000
Be careful.

274
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,720
- You got some in my eye.
- I'm going to wash my face.

275
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,640
PAN RESTAURANT

276
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,680
We're newly opened.

277
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,200
Come check it out.

278
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,760
SIFU FOUR LUCKS TEA HOUSE

279
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,400
We're open. Come check it out.

280
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
We're open.

281
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,720
Come taste the flavors.

282
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,760
- Excuse me.
- Sir, this way.

283
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,680
Watch your step.

284
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,280
Sir,

285
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,200
we just opened.

286
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,560
We have tea and snacks.

287
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,720
Please come in.

288
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,640
- Welcome.
- Okay.

289
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,960
Please, right this way.

290
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,040
- Come.
- Right this way.

291
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,600
Well, never mind.

292
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,520
Don't leave.

293
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,520
Come on.

294
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,280
The morning market's just finished.

295
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
Hurry up. Sell it.

296
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,320
Quick.

297
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,240
The snacks from Pan
are made by master chefs.

298
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,600
Five coins for two dishes.

299
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,720
Ten coins for four dishes.

300
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,280
Everyone's eager to try.

301
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,400
Tea vendors sell tea scraps.

302
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,320
One coin for a cup.

303
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,560
In a few days,

304
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,480
they'll take all our morning business.

305
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,200
Mind your work.

306
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,080
A little bit,

307
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,280
just tiny bits of business,

308
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,160
you just won't let go.

309
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,760
What kind of world is this?

310
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,480
Eating meat alone,

311
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,520
not sharing a sip of soup.

312
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Sir, this way.

313
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,320
Such a penny-pincher.

314
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,520
Make an effort.

315
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,320
We just opened.

316
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,480
Come dine with us here.

317
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,520
We just opened.

318
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,400
Sir, what are you looking at?

319
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,000
SIFU FOUR LUCKS TEA HOUSE

320
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,320
Isn't she from Fan's family?

321
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,320
Bitter.

322
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,520
Bitter?

323
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,480
This is top-quality Jianzhou white tea.
One tea cube costs a string.

324
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,240
How could it be bitter?

325
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,160
The tea isn't bitter,

326
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,720
but someone feels bitter.

327
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,280
Once they leave,

328
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,720
the bitterness is doubled.

329
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,560
In a few days,

330
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,560
someone will come begging.

331
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,880
Loose tea,15 coins.

332
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,840
Medium tea, 20 coins and three cents.

333
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,200
Top tea, 43 coins and four cents.

334
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,080
Tablet tea,

335
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,240
65 coins and four cents.

336
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,600
Enough.

337
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,360
Stop it.

338
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,240
It gives me a headache.

339
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,200
Where's Haode and Leshan?

340
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,440
They went out.

341
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,960
Check on other tea houses.

342
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,800
Try this.

343
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,920
Sugar-glazed pork is pricey.
Leave it to sell.

344
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
No one buys it.

345
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,760
I went to the morning market.

346
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,720
In Bianjing, people eat fine foods.

347
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,160
Only for steamed buns <i>baozi</i>,

348
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,480
they have various stuffings,
chicken, duck, goose, rabbit,

349
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,600
fish, eel,

350
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,400
bamboo, meat. You name it.

351
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,560
Crystal <i>baozi </i>and Seven Fillings <i>baozi</i>.

352
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,920
The names sound great

353
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,040
and it looks even better.

354
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,560
No matter how good this is,

355
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,320
we can't match them with the stuffing.

356
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,680
How can it stand out?

357
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,320
It's always losing money.

358
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,320
If I didn't pay

359
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,360
six months' rent,

360
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,840
I'd be packing up and heading back.

361
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,920
Why put up with this nonsense here?

362
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,600
That black-hearted Master Chai,

363
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,440
what grudges do we have?

364
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,680
Why's he doing this to us?

365
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,200
Fuhui,

366
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,560
can you ask your husband

367
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,880
to talk to them?

368
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,040
A big restaurant like this,

369
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,680
why struggle over small profits?

370
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,600
They won't starve, right?

371
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,720
Fuhui.

372
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,720
Fuhui.

373
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,400
Please?

374
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,320
Okay, I'll tell him later.

375
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,360
Mom.

376
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,080
Pan is fiercely competing with Baifan.
It's normal that he wants more earnings.

377
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,800
We want to ride on their success.

378
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,200
They can cut it off easily.

379
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,040
But back to the topic.

380
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,080
In business,

381
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,480
you have to earn with skills and tricks.

382
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,680
We can't depend on Fuhui.

383
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,320
If they are holding your neck now,
even if they won't strangle you,

384
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,640
it'll be hard to breathe.

385
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,680
What should we do then?

386
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,760
Tell me.

387
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,600
Fuhui,

388
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,280
what happened?

389
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,760
My parents-in-law came back yesterday.

390
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,600
My husband lay in bed, complaining
about account books and headaches.

391
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,560
Mother-in-law hugged him.

392
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,640
She felt sorry for him.

393
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,280
She said I'm not considerate enough.

394
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,520
She wants to take

395
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,400
a gentle concubine for him.

396
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,480
What?

397
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,600
If I don't agree,

398
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,560
she'll have him divorce me.

399
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,000
Nonsense!

400
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,600
That old hag's trying to bully us.

401
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,880
She thinks you don't have backup, huh?

402
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,560
I've heard about

403
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,120
families like this.

404
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,280
They say, in a way,

405
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,360
that men can only take a concubine
if there's no offspring at 40.

406
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,680
But they acted differently.
So many wives live in one home.

407
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,760
All disgusted perverts
and lecherous bastards.

408
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,720
She is not innocent either.

409
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,720
She thinks her son's too successful?

410
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,040
You've only been married for two years.

411
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,640
They want a concubine?

412
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,000
Bullshit!

413
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,400
I'll go tell her off.

414
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,160
This shameless old woman.

415
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,320
If she dares argue,

416
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
I'll slap her

417
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,080
right into the Bian River

418
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,000
as her grave.

419
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,240
Mom, don't stir up trouble.

420
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,680
So what?

421
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,280
Even if I killed her,

422
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,000
I'll trade my life for hers.

423
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,440
That loquacious woman.

424
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,360
Let her be reborn as a pig or dog.

425
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,880
Mom, calm down.

426
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,080
If he wants a concubine, let him do it.

427
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,120
He'll regret it.

428
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,800
Kangning, you mean…

429
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,400
We can't stop him from doing so.

430
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,000
You will say the process takes time.

431
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,440
They need to do some research on the city

432
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,560
to find a kind and gentle girl.

433
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,000
We need to keep
his situation under control

434
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,440
and handle the tea house steadily.

435
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,160
Shouhua, let's stick to the plan.

436
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,760
Close the shop for two days.

437
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,840
Wh-What?

438
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,640
Close the shop?

439
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,600
Yes.

440
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,800
It is a rush to open the tea house.

441
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,800
We need a new strategy.

442
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,920
We just opened for a few days.

443
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,880
Mom.

444
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,320
Do you have any money left?

445
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,840
Money?

446
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,000
Not at all.

447
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,720
- Of course, you do.
- No.

448
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,920
You do.

449
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,640
No, I don't…

450
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,400
They also sell <i>baozi</i>.

451
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,120
- Please.
- Coming right up.

452
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,640
Freshly made <i>baozi</i>.

453
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,360
I'll put this here.

454
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,640
Wontons.

455
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,600
See you next time.

456
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,080
SIFU FOUR LUCKS TEA HOUSE

457
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,840
So, that's their plan.

458
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,200
But it's still struggling.

459
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,040
Decorating the facade won't help much.

460
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,160
Sir.

461
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,720
Master Chai.

462
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,440
The Jin family with the blue umbrella

463
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,880
serves tender bamboo shoots and mushrooms

464
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,200
for Three-Crisp Broth.

465
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,320
The flatbreads nearby are famous too.

466
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,560
To the east,
the Xia family's candies are the best.

467
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,240
Also, Granny Zhang's cheese

468
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,960
and Bai's honey-glazed carving candies.

469
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,200
Wait.

470
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,240
You want to check out all these places?

471
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,640
Only by knowing
what the locals like to eat

472
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,760
can we do our business.

473
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,800
Let's go.

474
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,520
Sir.

475
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,240
We had some drunk guests causing trouble.

476
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,600
We can't get rid of them.

477
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,160
Pass on my orders.

478
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,920
Our singers shall not gather
at the corridor of the main hall.

479
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,200
If they're asked to come inside,
it's just for music

480
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,160
and company.

481
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,080
If guests misbehave,

482
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,120
you have my permission

483
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,440
to handle it.

484
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,640
It is a respectable place.

485
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,640
Singing or dancing is permitted.

486
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,920
Prostitution?

487
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,160
Seek that somewhere else.

488
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,160
Got it.

489
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,560
SIFU FOUR LUCKS TEA HOUSE

490
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,080
It's been so long.

491
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,640
Still no news.

492
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,760
News?

493
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,520
You mean Sifu?

494
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,680
Baifan Restaurant.

495
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,320
We got many customers
from the early market.

496
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,680
They play a game on the first
and 15th of the month.

497
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,600
The top-spending guests on these two days

498
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,200
even got a gold flag as a gift.

499
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,160
That's generous.

500
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,680
Work is going on for Sifu for days.

501
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,840
I secretly went to check.

502
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,280
The open hall was bright and wide.

503
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,440
They are making it smaller.

504
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,160
I'm not sure what they're planning.

505
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,160
Oh?

506
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,920
Sir,

507
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,200
my master sent me

508
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,200
with a message.

509
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,640
He says it's an urgent matter.

510
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,520
Please spare me a moment.

511
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,480
What could be so urgent?

512
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,800
My master said

513
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,240
it's a matter of life and death.

514
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,880
FAN'S MANSION

515
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,160
They're all good girls,

516
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,600
just from poor families.

517
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,680
Hard to live their life.

518
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,880
She volunteered to be a concubine.

519
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,320
Her parents asked for no dowry.

520
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,960
They want her to be safe and abundant.

521
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,840
A sack of fine rice each month,

522
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,200
for two years. There's one rule.

523
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,400
They need a written agreement.

524
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,560
The girl can't be a servant

525
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,680
or do hard labor.

526
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,360
I say,

527
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,960
with such beauty,

528
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,400
who'd make her do rough work?

529
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,200
Right?

530
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,400
As for these two,

531
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,280
they aren't as pretty.

532
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,760
But they cost only 100 strings.

533
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,360
How old are you?

534
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,640
Can you sing? Can you tune the zither?

535
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,280
Well,

536
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,960
if they could play music,

537
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,600
they'd cost more, wouldn't they?

538
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,920
You two, come closer.

539
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,640
Let her take a good look.

540
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,520
Pour me a cup of tea.

541
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,200
This is your so-called

542
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,480
life-and-death matter?

543
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,560
Cousin!

544
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,600
- Cousin.
- Don't touch me.

545
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,560
My dad said

546
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,800
I had to ask you first
before doing anything.

547
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,320
You can't leave me like this.

548
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,240
Cousin.

549
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,360
Lately,

550
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,800
my mind has been troubled.

551
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,400
The more I think, the more scared I get.

552
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,000
Cousin,

553
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,080
my dear cousin.

554
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,840
Cousin, have a seat.

555
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,880
Sit here.

556
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,120
Cousin,

557
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,480
please help me decide.

558
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,840
Should I

559
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,400
take a concubine or not?

560
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,760
Which one do you like?

561
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,640
They are not as good-looking as my wife.

562
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,880
But mother says

563
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,600
this is about a man's pride.

564
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,840
No respect from the wife,
the husband will be a joke.

565
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,000
She's determined this time

566
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,080
to crush her arrogance

567
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,080
and make her compliant.

568
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,520
I am afraid…

569
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,000
You too are scared?

570
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,400
I'm afraid it's a trap.

571
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,000
A deadly one.

572
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,200
No way.

573
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,080
It can't be.

574
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,760
My wife always keeps her word.

575
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,240
She never goes back on her promises.

576
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,800
Fan Lianghan,

577
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,400
take a good look.

578
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,720
Is your wife

579
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,200
the same as yesterday?

580
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,400
Behind this,

581
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,360
there might be some demonesses.

582
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,920
You just got rid of a tiger,
now you're facing a wolf.

583
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,840
Cousin, think it through.

584
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,120
Think clearly.

585
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,120
If you want a long life,

586
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,520
don't take a concubine.

587
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,400
No more bedroom dramas.

588
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,800
- What do you take me for?
- What?

589
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,880
Lie to me again

590
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,800
and I'll break your leg, Fan Lianghan.

591
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,120
Stay away from me.

592
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,040
Cousin.

593
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,640
My dear cousin!

594
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,160
Honey,

595
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,600
you are all I want.

596
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,520
I can't ask for more.

597
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,760
Send them back.

598
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,680
All of them.

599
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,240
Hey! But I brought them here for you.

600
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,720
How can you just turn them away?

601
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,680
Sir! Sir!

602
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,520
What kind of man changes his mind so fast?

603
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,920
He's clearly not interested.

604
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,040
Xiu,

605
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,360
give them their reward.

606
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,400
See them off.

607
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,400
- Sure.
- Thank you, Madam.

608
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,480
That Chai guy is so annoying.

609
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,160
He almost ruined everything.

610
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,840
It's over. Why are you still bothering me?

611
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,000
Cousin, you haven't told me

612
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,960
what trap this is?

613
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,400
My heart

614
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,760
is still racing like crazy.

615
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,960
With your simple mind,
that would stress you out.

616
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,480
You're still not turning down

617
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,880
the idea of concubines.

618
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,400
I'm telling you, drop that idea now.

619
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,320
Leave me alone.

620
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,840
Who is she?

621
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,240
The business has grown.

622
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,640
Lots of unfamiliar faces.

623
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,760
Should I ask around for you?

624
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,640
Go, go, quickly.

625
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,480
Cousin,

626
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,960
you come and go every day.

627
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,520
Haven't you noticed

628
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,040
she has the same eyes as my wife?

629
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,120
If I had time to check on girls,

630
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,400
I'd rather read my books.

631
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,120
Get up.

632
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,440
Cousin, with your temper,

633
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,200
you'll scare your wife off with one word.

634
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,640
Ten coffins couldn't be enough.

635
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,200
- Get up.
- I'm not done looking yet.

636
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,400
Sir, I have the details.

637
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,600
That woman lives on South Slant Street.

638
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,000
She was heading to Guangzhou.

639
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,320
She got separated

640
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,440
and tricked by bad guys.
She came here as a performer.

641
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,200
After hearing this,

642
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,000
Master Fan rushed to pay for her freedom.

643
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,480
He even set a date

644
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,200
to marry her in five days.

645
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,960
Something feels off.

646
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,160
Are you having doubts?

647
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,360
I don't know why.

648
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,400
Something isn't right.

649
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,040
That fool has no clue

650
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,280
what mistake he's making.

651
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,040
I'll dig deeper?

652
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,720
SIFU FOUR LUCKS TEA HOUSE

653
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
No.

654
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,960
I'll investigate myself.

655
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,200
Snacks from Pan,
requested by the third lady.

656
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,320
Just this little plate.

657
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,960
Sweet, savory, meaty, mild, all in one.

658
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,320
This candied plum mille-feuille alone

659
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,360
must've taken so much effort.

660
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,560
I'm good at making snacks.

661
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,520
Not many desserts

662
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,080
are too hard for me.

663
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,440
But I am not that confident now.

664
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,000
Four pieces cost ten coins?

665
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,600
Early market goers

666
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,240
or night workers

667
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,800
might pay for fun,

668
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,920
but not every day.

669
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,160
Bite-sized snacks don't fill you up.

670
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,760
I say we go for Qiongnu's specialty,
roasted flatbread.

671
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,440
Slice the flatbread into thin pieces.

672
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,400
Coat it with honey.

673
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,520
Roast it to be crispy.

674
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,120
Fragrant and filling.

675
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,000
I am afraid the folks in Bianjing

676
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,960
will find it cheap.

677
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,400
We are not using expensive ingredients.

678
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,640
It must feel refined.

679
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,840
Give it another name.

680
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,840
Slice them into the shape of leaves.

681
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,440
When you chew, it makes a crispy sound.

682
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,000
Let's call it Crispy Leaves.

683
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,960
Kangning, what do you think?

684
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,280
True.

685
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,720
Let me.

686
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,200
Use the back door.

687
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,320
Switch to sesame oil.

688
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,280
Less smoke.

689
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,720
Not sure if your plan will work.

690
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,560
Let's save money on the lighting.

691
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,360
Honestly,

692
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,440
it's all that meddler's fault.

693
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,000
One day,

694
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,120
I'll teach him a lesson.

695
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,400
Look at you.

696
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,840
Master Zhang, what a rare guest!

697
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,360
Come. I'll take you inside.

698
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,960
- Right this way.
- You're back, sir.

699
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,640
Your family has been asking about you.

700
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,120
Tell them I'm fine.
I've got something to do.

701
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,000
Be back at dusk.
Tell my mother not to worry.

702
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,880
Where is he rushing off to?

703
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,920
To save someone.

704
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,520
Let's go.

705
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,720
Master Chai, here to celebrate?

706
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,640
What celebration?

707
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,880
My master is taking a new concubine.

708
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,720
Didn't we send your family an invite?

709
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,920
Master Fan said

710
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,040
he wanted to share the joy with you.

711
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,640
What? You didn't get it?

712
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,000
Isn't it tomorrow?

713
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,400
The date changed.

714
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,360
Sir, sir.

715
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,680
Look at her.

716
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,120
So pretty

717
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,400
and gentle.

718
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,320
MADAM FAN

719
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,240
My boy's so lucky.

720
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,400
Enough. Go serve tea to your mistress.

721
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,080
Once she drinks it,

722
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,600
you'll officially join the family.

723
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,200
You're one of us.

724
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,680
Why are you crying?

725
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,280
Lady Zhen,

726
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,480
why are you crying

727
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,200
on such a good day?

728
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,320
Were you forced into this?

729
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,480
- Fan Lianghan?
- Dad.

730
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,560
I wouldn't dare!

731
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,240
Lady Zhen, speak for me!

732
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,840
I'm from a scholar's family in Jianzhou.

733
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,680
My family had a career in the government.

734
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,160
Six years ago,

735
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,040
he died

736
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,680
in his position.

737
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,640
Mother and I took a journey
to find my relatives.

738
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,640
On the way, I was tricked by criminals

739
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,680
and forced into prostitution.

740
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,080
Today, the Fan family saved me.

741
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,600
Finally, I have a shelter.

742
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,800
Seeing your kindness reminds me

743
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,720
of my late parents.

744
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,280
I feel ashamed

745
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,000
to dishonor my ancestors.

746
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,000
I couldn't hold back my tears.

747
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,080
What?

748
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,120
You're a…?

749
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,000
So that's the story.

750
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,160
How pitiful.

751
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,440
Bring me some silver.

752
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,520
Th-This is…?

753
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,480
This is all my son's fault.

754
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,840
We're only merchants, and can't reach for
a noble scholar's daughter like you.

755
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,440
This is ridiculous.
Sorry for involving you in this.

756
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,640
Take this money

757
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,600
as compensation.

758
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,200
Rest assured, young lady,

759
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,920
I'll send someone to take you home.

760
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,800
You can find your mother
and be with her safely.

761
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,080
- Dad?
- Great goodness, thank you, my lord.

762
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,840
I'll never forget.

763
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,880
The master promised to send you home.

764
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,080
He'll keep his word.

765
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,040
Cheer up. It's good news.

766
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,360
Wipe your tears.

767
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,360
It's over.

768
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,080
What?

769
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,680
Master Chai.

770
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,760
A merchant

771
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,440
marrying a scholar's daughter?

772
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,920
Are you insane?

773
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,560
What are you thinking?

774
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,040
If word spreads,

775
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,440
our whole family will suffer.

776
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,080
I'll be ruined!

777
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,920
You ungrateful fool!

778
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,600
Stop, stop! Don't hit him!

779
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,240
What grudge did I owe in my past life?

780
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,680
A useless son and an unworthy wife.

781
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,920
You even pushed him to take a concubine.

782
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,400
You're the root of this misfortune!

783
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,720
I'll deal with you later!

784
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,760
Out of my way, you fool.

785
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,160
- Father-in-law, please!
- Don't run!

786
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,120
- Dear!
- I know nothing!

787
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,480
I'm innocent!

788
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,800
Stop! Please calm down.

789
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,560
It's all my fault

790
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,880
for not stopping him.

791
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,320
If he's guilty,

792
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,560
I share the responsibility.

793
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,400
Punish me instead.

794
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,240
Stay out of this! No one interferes!

795
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,960
- You brat.
- Uncle.

796
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,680
- Un--
- Cousin!

797
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,640
My dad's going to kill me.

798
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,880
Uncle, it is still hot outside.

799
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,800
Don't let the heat

800
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,520
and anger get to you. Be careful.

801
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,360
You shall hit me first
before getting to him.

802
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,280
Nephew An, beg for mercy for him.

803
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,920
Uncle,

804
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,720
the performer had a tragic life.

805
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,760
She was sold off
or tricked into this life.

806
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,520
The owners have ways
to cover everything up.

807
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,960
We can never verify everything.

808
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,800
Lady Zhen kept quiet

809
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,640
for her family's honor.

810
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,920
You know your son best.

811
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,120
His personality

812
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
is kind and softhearted.

813
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,320
So, he fell for the trap.

814
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,120
He's learned his lesson now.

815
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,000
- He won't do it again.
- That's okay.

816
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,000
So,

817
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,320
for my sake,

818
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,400
spare him this time.

819
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,200
A disgrace to the family.

820
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,400
A disgrace to the family!

821
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,360
Father-in-law.

822
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,400
Mom.

823
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,480
It's okay, I'm here. Don't be scared.

824
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,640
Honey, are you alright?

825
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,960
Honey,

826
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,480
you're the only one who loves me!

827
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,040
Okay. That's fine.

828
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,000
It hurts so much.

829
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,840
I know. Come here.

830
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,280
Ow, ow, ow!

831
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,640
He hit you so hard.

832
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,200
How long will it take to heal?

833
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,800
Lady Zhen.

834
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,760
She set me up.

835
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,080
You were right about this.

836
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,280
Beauty is a trap.

837
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,040
Those vixens

838
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,040
will skin me alive.

839
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,080
I'll never take a concubine again.

840
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,200
Never again, not in this life.

841
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,000
If I do,

842
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,680
I shall be split into two pieces
by lightning.

843
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,080
- One piece for you.
- Sure.

844
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,720
As your umbrella.

845
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,680
The other half will be your footstool.

846
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,800
For you to tread on

847
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,160
for the rest of my life.

848
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,800
It hurts so much.

849
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,080
Okay, I know.

850
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,120
Master Chai,

851
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,240
didn't you have words

852
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,840
for him?

853
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,560
I'll go inform him for you.

854
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,480
No need.

855
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,360
- He's beyond saving.
- I'll be gentle.

856
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,920
No medicine can help him.

857
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,240
Has he been hit so badly?

858
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,520
If I did it again…

859
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,120
- He is so sick…
- I know.

860
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,320
…that nothing can cure him.

861
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,520
- You will be fine.
- Idiot.

862
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,000
Hold on a little longer.

863
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,520
You'll be fine soon.

864
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,760
Thanks.

865
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,840
I thought

866
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,520
my whole life would be wasted
in that filthy place.

867
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,600
I never dreamed I'd see the light of day.

868
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,440
Now I can return home.

869
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,080
I should thank you both for the help.

870
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,600
Please, let me bow in gratitude.

871
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,840
Oh no, I can't accept that.

872
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,360
We helped you,

873
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,520
but you helped us too.

874
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,400
Lady Zhen,

875
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,560
find your mother.

876
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,080
Live well together.

877
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,520
Just go. Don't let anyone see.

878
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,680
Just go.

879
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,040
Be careful.

880
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,400
Take this to eat.

881
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,200
Thanks.

882
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,360
My third lady, let's go too.

883
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,960
Stop.

884
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,320
I saw everything just now.

885
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,360
She's gone now.

886
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,880
No evidence whatsoever.

887
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,800
So what?

888
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,000
Master Chai,

889
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,840
it's late.
I can't stay for idle talk.

890
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,360
Let me withdraw myself.

891
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,520
I bid you goodbye. Chunlai.

892
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,880
Let's go.

893
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,520
Stop.

894
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,880
<i>Baozi </i>from Dong Mei Tea House,
famous in Bianjing.

895
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,520
I brought these for you to try.

896
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,800
If you don't want to settle,

897
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,160
report me if you like.

898
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,080
I am leaving.

899
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,080
What a waste.

900
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,880
Two <i>baozi </i>with crab meet stuffing.

901
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,680
I brought it for research.

902
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,920
Well, like tossing <i>baozi </i>to a dog!

903
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,920
She's insulting you.

904
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,600
She meant don't meddle
around like a nosy dog.

905
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,840
What an unruly young lady.

906
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,120
Sir,

907
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,960
should we tell Master Fan?

908
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,000
That crazy coward
was in his wife's cuddle,

909
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,800
sobbing like hell.

910
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,120
What's the point of telling him?

911
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,520
Let's head back.

912
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,400
PAN RESTAURANT

913
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,240
Alright, get going.

914
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,200
- Distinguished guests.
- Look over here.

915
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,440
Sifu House is now open.

916
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,360
FRAGRANCE SHOP

917
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,400
New Shop.

918
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,840
It's open.

919
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,880
Looks great.

920
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,120
Guests, come on in!

921
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,280
Take a look.

922
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,200
Sifu is back in business.

923
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,480
- Everyone.
- Come quickly.

924
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,560
- Our shop…
- It has started.

925
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,840
…may be small,

926
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,240
- but it has a refined style.
- What's in it?

927
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,080
Tea and incense, flowers and treasures,

928
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,040
we have it all, just as you scholars like.

929
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,680
Whether you are looking for a resting spot

930
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,160
after strolling around the streets,

931
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,800
or just finished shopping for treasures,

932
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,360
at the east tower, you may want

933
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,120
the goods to be checked and evaluated

934
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,880
or just a cozy spot

935
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,040
to chat over tea.

936
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,000
This is the perfect place for you.

937
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,880
A little shop with all four refined arts.

938
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,840
Isn't it rare?

939
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,720
Of course.

940
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,920
Our shop

941
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,160
has books, art, incense, and tea.

942
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,280
Come in and see for yourselves.

943
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,360
Let's go take a look.

944
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,400
Welcome, esteemed guests.

945
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,480
Come in.

946
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,560
- Step inside.
- Right this way.

947
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,840
Come in.

948
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,000
- Right this way.
- Sir.

949
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,280
- Let's go.
- Let's try.

950
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,400
Sir.

951
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,360
- Right this way.
- Hang it higher.

952
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,280
Hang…

953
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,200
Right this way.

954
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,080
Welcome.

955
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,080
Come inside.

956
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,400
Let's go.

957
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,320
Hang it higher.

958
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,280
FRAGRANCE SHOP

959
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,160
Okay. That's it.

960
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,080
Let's see which one is higher now.

961
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,040
- Look.
- This bottle's glaze is flawless.

962
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,880
- Such perfect coloring.
- Looks great.

963
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,400
- I like this.
- It's so rare.

964
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,840
The craftsmanship is exquisite.

965
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,960
Did this bottle catch your eye?

966
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,480
You have a great eye.

967
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,280
In my opinion,

968
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,400
the word emptiness

969
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,440
in Zhang's poem is genius.

970
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,880
Nothing more, nothing less.

971
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,960
This place is unique.

972
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,160
Pity it's a bit small

973
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,720
compared to Pan Restaurant.

974
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,280
You're right.

975
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,440
But your daily expense there

976
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,320
could cover a whole month's tea here.

977
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,560
- Really?
- That's so tacky.

978
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,600
You see.

979
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,440
Tea and poetry.

980
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,720
Instruments and songs.

981
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,720
It's all about peace of mind.

982
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,840
Small, but charming.

983
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,160
True,

984
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,440
but small can also be elegant.
Grace can also be boring.

985
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,240
- It is up to us to decide, right?
- Sure.

986
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,880
So, they're drawing in

987
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,720
those who can't afford our lounge?

988
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,160
Even incorporating the fruit
and incense trades?

989
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,440
Shameless.

990
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,720
Cousin, you're here.

991
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,480
That painting looks familiar.

992
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,040
Your wound's healed?

993
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,320
Thanks to my wife's care.

994
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,680
I should thank you

995
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,160
for saving my life that day.

996
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,480
Who's running the store here?

997
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,880
Good understanding of tea and incense.

998
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,440
Noble daughters
may not know more than that.

999
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,920
A small gentry family like the Li's

1000
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,880
must have high hopes for their daughters.

1001
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,440
The manager at the treasure counter
is no ordinary person.

1002
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,120
Right this way. The shop may be small.

1003
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,680
- That manager is not someone else.
- Help yourself.

1004
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,160
Mother-in-law couldn't find
the right manager.

1005
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,400
So, I recommended Manager Liao.

1006
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,640
You introduced him to me.

1007
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,760
Forgive me, cousin.

1008
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,200
My wife asked me.

1009
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,960
I had no choice.

1010
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,440
What day is it today?

1011
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,440
Master Chai graced us with his presence.

1012
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,560
Shame.

1013
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,720
Our humble shop is too small

1014
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,960
for your precious presence.

1015
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,760
So, please,

1016
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,120
kindly step aside.

1017
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,520
We have a business to run.

1018
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,400
Hey, mother-in-law.

1019
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,320
Mother.

1020
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,520
That painting's an original by Wu Daozi.

1021
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,600
I borrowed it from the Chai family.

1022
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,200
Please have some respect.

1023
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,520
This gradient glaze,

1024
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,240
it's so hard to master.

1025
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,160
Cousin, just a few days for show.

1026
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,960
I'll return it next month.

1027
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,600
Madam,

1028
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,560
I want a tea duel.

1029
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,200
The tea organizer is impressive.

1030
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,080
The tea here has creamy swirls
that linger so long.

1031
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,400
Quite talented.

1032
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,160
Can I meet this tea master?

1033
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,760
You're too kind, sir.

1034
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,480
Unmarried daughters

1035
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,040
can't meet guests.

1036
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,560
Unexpected.

1037
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,440
The tea master

1038
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,760
is a young lady?

1039
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,120
The boudoir hides many talents.

1040
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,880
Even the jasmine in this pot

1041
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,400
is sublime.

1042
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,760
Did she make this too?

1043
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,760
I am here running a business for a living.

1044
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,800
I don't want to talk about my daughters
like they are topics of conversation.

1045
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,280
So, forgive me.

1046
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,280
Enjoy your tea.

1047
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,280
Please help yourself.

1048
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,320
Forget it.

1049
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,480
We can visit here again.

1050
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,920
Plenty of chances to meet her.

1051
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,520
Cousin, wait for me.

1052
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,640
Cousin.

1053
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,800
What's so funny?

1054
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,720
I am glad that we have so many customers.

1055
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,960
Careful, it's hot!

1056
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,160
Did Master Chai offend you in some way?

1057
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,200
You asked Master Fan
to borrow that painting.

1058
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,320
Meant to upset him?

1059
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,880
He is nosy.

1060
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,960
Serves him right.

1061
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,560
Is this pastry ready yet?

1062
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,160
Cousin, why didn't you tell me earlier?

1063
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,120
I checked the source from the bawd.

1064
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,200
I tracked down the man

1065
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,040
who tricked Lady Zhen.

1066
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,080
I forced him to reveal her true story.

1067
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,400
I rushed back

1068
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,000
to tell you.

1069
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:04,960
Stop.

1070
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,680
The matter is settled.

1071
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,920
You want to bring this up again?
Stop dreaming.

1072
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,200
If you want another beating,

1073
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,400
I won't stop you.

1074
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,280
But how did they know

1075
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,600
I'd choose Lady Zhen?

1076
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,800
You are just crazy.
That time in Luoyang,

1077
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,560
you went to collect the rent,
you met Fuhui the first time

1078
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,880
when she was out for a walk.

1079
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,000
That was planned as well?

1080
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,560
Never mind, you won't listen.

1081
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,640
Deqing, take him away.

1082
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,960
Cousin, you have to help me here!

1083
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,720
I don't have such a foolish cousin.

1084
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,160
You're only older by half an hour,

1085
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,400
and I've called you cousin

1086
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,680
for years.

1087
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,480
Right. Also, do you remember
when you fell into the well?

1088
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,440
I cried for help and saved you.

1089
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,160
You actually wet your pants in fear.
Stop flattering yourself.

1090
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,640
Deqing, take him away.

1091
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,800
I'll listen to you then.

1092
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,000
- Get away.
- I will comply.

1093
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,760
- Get up.
- I swear.

1094
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,680
I'll never do something behind your back.

1095
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,040
For real?

1096
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,760
If you get softhearted and mess up
my plans again,

1097
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,520
I'll toss you into the well myself.

1098
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,920
Deqing.

1099
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,760
- Call Manager Liao here.
- Sure.

1100
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,000
Yes. Bring him

1101
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,440
and the painting back.

1102
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,440
Get away.

1103
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,800
Sir, come right in.

1104
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,720
- This way.
- Welcome.

1105
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,560
You had the nerve to use my manager

1106
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,960
and borrow my painting?

1107
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,680
Paying some interest sounds reasonable.

1108
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,600
