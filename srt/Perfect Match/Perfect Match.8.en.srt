00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,440
EPISODE 8

2
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,080
Masters.

3
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,840
Our Madam urged us to bring you the books,

4
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,840
lest we hinder your studies.

5
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,760
She also said that academic studies

6
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,120
might be important.

7
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,080
But Mr. Sang,
you just got over a long illness.

8
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,080
Please take care of yourself
and don't rush it.

9
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,120
See? What did I tell you?

10
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,560
Please thank Madam Li for me.

11
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,560
T-this is…?

12
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,040
Sorry, that was a mistake.

13
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,320
- This is not for you.
- Wait.

14
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,600
<i>Luxuriant Dew of the Spring</i>
<i>and Autumn Annals. </i>Volume 17.

15
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,920
All the copies I found
in the Xiangguo Temple book market

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,840
were missing the last two pages.

17
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,640
Where did you get this from?

18
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,560
- I…
- Listen, Chunlai.

19
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,960
May I keep it for a few days and return it

20
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,640
after I copy the last two pages?

21
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,960
That's not up to me.

22
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,520
I must go back and ask…

23
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,680
Ask whom?

24
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,040
Our third lady.

25
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,120
Her literary matchmaking failed,

26
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,760
and she gave you a donkey in the end.

27
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,520
And she plays the flute.

28
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,720
Stop gossiping.

29
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,600
I'll tell our madam to punish you.

30
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,160
Please allow me

31
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,040
to ask our third lady for permission.

32
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,800
But…

33
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,720
Wait.

34
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,640
If you know her, please go talk to her.

35
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,760
She holds a grudge against me.

36
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,600
She would kick me out if I went there.

37
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,400
I don't care. I want the book.

38
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,440
Hurry up and go.

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,800
Master, what are you…?

40
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,320
I ruined her engagement,

41
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,200
and now I'm asking her for a book.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,320
If I don't get the book,

43
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,480
considering Andao's obsession with books,

44
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,800
I won't hear the end of it.

45
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
But I really think

46
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,920
I'll get a good beating if I talk to her.

47
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,320
It's all Master Chai's fault.

48
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,440
Master, I'm truly sorry.

49
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,440
There she is.

50
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,600
Hurry. Shouhua has been waiting.

51
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,720
Slow down. Watch your step.

52
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,040
So well wrapped. What is this?

53
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,880
Yuanming.

54
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,240
It's freezing out here.

55
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,880
Why are you reading outdoors?

56
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,760
Are you expecting someone?

57
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,680
Who would visit me?

58
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,640
It's just that

59
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,680
the room is warm and makes me drowsy.

60
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,360
I feel more awake out here.

61
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,240
Gentlemen, please come in.

62
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,200
Yuanming, why did you return
what we sent you?

63
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,680
Why do you insist
on returning those things?

64
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,560
Don't get us wrong.

65
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,000
Sang Andao is eccentric and peculiar.

66
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,080
He says that receiving gifts for no reason

67
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,760
might damage our luck on the exam.

68
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,440
Besides, we can't
accept rewards without merits.

69
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,120
Are you suspecting me
of bribing you before you even

70
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,120
become officials?

71
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,480
These are just some clothes.

72
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,240
They don't cost much.

73
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,520
You know Yuanming.

74
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,560
He didn't befriend us for material gains.

75
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,640
A pure friendship lasts the longest.

76
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,200
Don't you see?

77
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,840
Although he lives here,

78
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,160
he doesn't take anything
from the Li family.

79
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,400
Mr. Chai knows me the best.

80
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,000
That's my friend.

81
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,720
You, oh you.

82
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
Master Du.

83
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,000
Our third lady says

84
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,000
that ambergris comes from the far west.

85
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,760
It's a rare gift from someone.

86
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,800
We even sent it to a shop
to embed it with jade. It's very valuable.

87
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,560
Thankfully, you found and returned it

88
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,000
and saved us from trouble.

89
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,520
We can't repay your noble deed.

90
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,440
We only have a set of ink and inkstone,

91
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,680
which comes in handy for writing.

92
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,960
Please kindly accept it.

93
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,320
Everyone says the ink
made by Pan Gu of Shezhou

94
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,600
is the best.

95
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,120
Very few know that the fancy inks
outside the Xiangguo Temple

96
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,320
are mostly fake.

97
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,520
Look.

98
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,960
It's made
by the Ink Immortal with his trademark.

99
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,680
Right here.

100
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,080
Let me see.

101
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,960
This inkstone also looks fancy.

102
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,160
PLUM BLOSSOMS MINGLED WITH FALLING SNOW

103
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,320
Our third lady also said

104
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,120
it once belonged to our master.

105
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,240
It's a pity to let it lie in dust.

106
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,280
If you do not accept it,

107
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,360
she can only repay you with money.

108
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,040
Accept it.

109
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,360
You found her ambergris,
which is more precious than gold.

110
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,040
It's a token of gratitude.

111
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,400
So, you've earned it. Just accept it.

112
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,280
Then, please thank
your third lady for me, Chunlai.

113
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,360
How did it slip from my hands?

114
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,800
That was a top-quality Dengni inkstone.

115
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,160
What a shame.

116
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,320
Brother, that was such a fine inkstone.

117
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,440
Why were you so careless?

118
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,440
Listen, Yuanming, relax.

119
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,760
I will compensate you with my inkstone
made from Qingzhou Hongsi stone.

120
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,240
Don't bother with this one.

121
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,520
LUXURIANT DEW OF THE SPRING
AND AUTUMN ANNALS

122
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,920
Chunlai, please thank your third lady.

123
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,800
Brother, why are you
pulling a long face again?

124
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,720
Wait. I need to talk to you.

125
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,320
Dig in.

126
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,800
Betting on both sides.

127
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,720
Be careful. You may end up

128
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,400
winning nothing.

129
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,920
Kangning, it's freezing.
Better head back inside.

130
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,800
What's wrong?

131
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,760
You failed?

132
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,520
It was almost done.

133
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,120
But I didn't expect that Mr. Chai

134
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,560
would drop the fine inkstone.

135
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,200
He did?

136
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,720
Yes, he did.

137
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,640
Kangning.

138
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,720
I told you to take action in his absence

139
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,000
to avoid any disturbance.

140
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,200
This person harbors ill intentions.

141
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,640
You've been carving that all night.

142
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,320
He did well.

143
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,400
I won't blame him.
I must thank him, instead.

144
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,000
Thank you.

145
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,040
<i>Plum blossoms mingled with falling snow.</i>

146
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,480
<i>How many flowers bloom upon the trees?</i>

147
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,080
<i>Truly one must drink to the full,</i>

148
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,360
<i>hoping that the like-minded will join.</i>

149
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,600
Well-formed verses showing appreciation.

150
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,160
So much affection.

151
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,640
Li Kangning, you're going
to great lengths for Du Yangxi.

152
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,040
So, Kangning did this…

153
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,720
I see. My mother-in-law fancies him.

154
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,480
Makes sense.

155
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,320
He truly stands out from the rest
with his appearance and talent.

156
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,880
Whoever marries him

157
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,400
may be respected
as the wife of a top scholar one day.

158
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
Who wouldn't be tempted?

159
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,760
Brother, actually,
I'm here to persuade you

160
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,240
on your mother's behalf.

161
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,640
If you don't want to get beaten,

162
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,280
hold your tongue.

163
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,480
Auntie promised

164
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,960
not to bring up anyone you dislike again.

165
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,520
It's just that there is a family

166
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,920
that matches the Chai family
with their wealth.

167
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,080
The daughter of that family
is graceful and demure.

168
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,960
And you've grown up together
as childhood sweethearts.

169
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,640
It would be nice if you could get married.

170
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,760
Both your families could prosper.

171
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,880
You know her. It's Liu Baniang.

172
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,200
Who?

173
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,840
You know her.

174
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,240
She's Liu Tang's daughter.

175
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,040
You used to call her "little sister".

176
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,640
- Her?
- That's right.

177
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,960
How did I forget about her?

178
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,800
Speaking of which,
I haven't seen her for two years.

179
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,320
We should totally meet up.

180
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,880
Brother, I'm glad you've come around.

181
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,800
I'll tell Auntie right away
to arrange a meeting for you.

182
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,680
Wait for me.

183
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,320
Li Kangning.

184
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,000
This time, you can't blame me.

185
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,440
Even heaven is working against you.

186
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,760
Who are you? Let go of me.

187
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,720
Who are you?

188
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,960
Let go. Untie me.

189
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,000
Untie me.

190
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,360
You may leave.

191
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,560
- Understood.
- Understood.

192
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,880
You abducted me.

193
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,880
If my wife asks, you must testify for me.

194
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,360
I didn't sneak away.

195
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,960
I told you not to tease him.

196
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,320
Look how you've scared him.

197
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,640
Brother, help. Untie me.

198
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,680
Brother, untie me.

199
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,680
Baniang invited you over
with good intentions.

200
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,920
Who on earth invites guests like this?

201
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,840
I was startled.

202
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,120
Master Fan, please don't be mad.

203
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,480
Chai An told me that

204
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,240
you were confined at home by your wife

205
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,880
to study the account books.

206
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,200
So, that was my last resort.

207
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,720
If your wife asks about it one day,

208
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,160
just blame it on me.

209
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,760
You make it sound so easy.

210
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,040
What if she asks,

211
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,000
"Why would
a single young lady abduct you

212
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,480
and not someone else?

213
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,840
Is there something between you?"

214
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,960
What am I supposed to say?

215
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,000
Tell me.

216
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,280
Brother, let's get to business.

217
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,120
Baniang invited you to ask for a favor.

218
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,000
Thanks to Master Chai,

219
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,240
we found a great physician

220
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,400
who managed to cure my long illness.

221
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,960
I just recovered.
Why are you coughing now?

222
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,920
It's because
I've been copying the book for you.

223
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,360
How much debt
did I owe you from a past life?

224
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,440
Alright, I'll return it.

225
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,160
LUXURIANT DEW OF THE SPRING
AND AUTUMN ANNALS

226
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,200
Fine, return it yourself.

227
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,480
Catch a glimpse of Li Kangning

228
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
for the sake
of the enchanting flute sound.

229
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,480
The Fan family invited me over
to paint this afternoon.

230
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,920
I need to do a draft first.

231
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,480
Go away. Leave me alone.

232
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,800
The Fan family?

233
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,960
Maybe it's Li Kangning's excuse
to see you?

234
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,560
Really?

235
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,120
Leshan really loves to be different.

236
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,480
So much fuss over wontons.

237
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,400
Dough made with plum blossoms water.

238
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,040
And the wontons must be cooked
in chicken soup, right?

239
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,000
Mother was jealous
of Madam Liang's tea shop.

240
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,760
With the Winter Solstice approaching,

241
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,440
she thought wontons would sell.

242
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,480
But I think it's too much of a fuss.

243
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,120
Make different fillings
and cook everything in one pot.

244
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,480
I bet Hundred Flavor Wontons
will sell the best.

245
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,800
That would be nice.

246
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,480
But it's not as elegant as plum blossoms.

247
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,240
I'm afraid the scholars next door
won't be impressed.

248
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,760
What? Say it again.

249
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,240
At midday,

250
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,720
Master's servant Fan Jiu
opened the back door

251
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,600
and led a young lady inside.

252
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,360
Well, well.

253
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,240
I've only been out for a moment

254
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,120
and he's been
bringing ladies into the house.

255
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,480
He never learns his lesson.

256
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,600
- Step aside.
- Fuhui.

257
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,040
Kangning. There might be trouble.
Keep an eye on her.

258
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,240
Fuhui.

259
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,840
FAN'S MANSION

260
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,760
Brother.

261
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,160
I'm taking a huge risk by helping you.

262
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,360
I let an unmarried lady into the house.

263
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,840
If my wife finds out,
she will skin me alive.

264
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,840
Liu Baniang is only meeting someone here.

265
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,160
Do you have to be so anxious?

266
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,800
Why here and not at your place?

267
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,120
I am a married man.

268
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,680
She is a single lady.

269
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,040
When did we ever become acquainted?

270
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,120
How do I explain that?

271
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,160
If my wife finds out,

272
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,680
she's going to lose it out of jealousy.

273
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,760
You're not the one who's going to suffer.

274
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,600
The Chai and Liu families
are discussing a marital alliance.

275
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,920
She can't go to my place.

276
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,600
That's why she came here.

277
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,120
Besides, I'm here to defend you.

278
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,480
Masters, the painter has arrived.

279
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,880
I have sent her over
as you instructed, Master Chai.

280
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,160
- Good job. You may leave now.
- Understood.

281
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,600
I hope Liu Baniang
can vent her anger and leave soon.

282
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,480
Don't let my wife run into her.

283
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,000
<i>Brother, I'm afraid I have to</i>
<i>sacrifice you this time.</i>

284
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,600
Stop right there.

285
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,040
You're back, my lady.
Let me inform my master.

286
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,360
No need. I'll find who I'm looking for.

287
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,760
We'll settle this later on.

288
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,840
- My lady.
- Fuhui.

289
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,840
My lady.

290
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,360
Fuhui, slow down.

291
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,320
- My lady, our master is not there.
- Listen to me.

292
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,520
Fuhui.

293
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,320
My lady, our master is not in the study.

294
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,760
Come with me.

295
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,200
Master Chai, what are you doing?

296
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,240
Let go.

297
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,160
Don't you want to know
what kind of person Du Yangxi is?

298
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,440
Please hide in there.

299
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,160
Master Du will be here?

300
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,840
I am an honest man.

301
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,080
Have I ever lied to you?

302
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,640
I'm only trying
to expose someone's true nature.

303
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,200
I will not hurt you.

304
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,000
Besides, we're in the Fan's mansion.

305
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,640
- But--
- Cats hide their claws.

306
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,120
How can you marry someone
without knowing his true colors?

307
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,280
Kangning, I am trying to help you.

308
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,320
Please.

309
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,440
Get up.

310
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,240
Hurry.

311
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,800
My wife is looking for me. Be quiet.

312
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,760
My lady, please be careful.

313
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,440
Lady Liu.

314
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,160
Why did you corner me here?

315
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,920
What exactly do you want?

316
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,240
I want to talk things through with you.

317
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,200
Master Du, you haven't told me

318
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,640
why you turned me down.

319
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,120
I'm a humble man of modest ability
and mediocre talent.

320
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,400
I don't deserve a lady like you.

321
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,600
Nonsense.

322
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,480
I bet you refused to marry me

323
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,680
because you looked down upon my family
for being merchants

324
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,920
and wanted to marry
into a distinguished family

325
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,720
to cling to real power in the court.

326
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,960
Then why are you living
next door to the Li family

327
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,920
and thinking about marrying Li Kangning?

328
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,200
There is no such thing.

329
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,840
As a Juren who came for the imperial exam,

330
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,600
you're living next

331
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,800
to a family with five daughters
without avoiding the ladies.

332
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,040
How dare you deny it?

333
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,320
Lady Liu.

334
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,600
It's my own business,

335
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,120
no matter whether

336
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,920
it's true or not.

337
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,760
If you favor a lady
from a distinguished family

338
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,240
due to your pride and ambition,

339
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,160
then I accept the fact
that we're not meant to be.

340
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,280
And it's fine by me.

341
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,320
But you chose Li Kangning over me.

342
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,520
Then I must ask.

343
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,880
Ask what?

344
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,080
Is it because they are wealthy
or that they offer a huge dowry?

345
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,080
Even if she is pretty,
am I much uglier than her?

346
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,120
Even if she is talented,
do I look dumb to you?

347
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,240
Master Du.

348
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,960
Look closely.

349
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,160
Am I inferior to her?

350
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,880
No.

351
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,280
You are perfect as you are.

352
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,720
But marriage is predestined.

353
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,960
It can't be forced.

354
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,760
I don't care if you turn me down.

355
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,240
But you're buttering them up
while rejecting me.

356
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,840
You're clearly humiliating me.

357
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,320
Everyone in Bianjing will think
Li Kangning is better than me.

358
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,680
Even a Juren who has not
passed the imperial exam

359
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,000
dares to deceive me,
abandon me, and humiliate me.

360
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,880
Don't even think about leaving
if you don't give me

361
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,800
an explanation.

362
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,880
Fine.

363
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,760
You want an explanation.
I will give you one.

364
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,920
There are three things
I don't value in taking a wife.

365
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,320
First, her family background.

366
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,880
Second, the dowry she offers.

367
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,120
Third, her looks and talents.

368
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,040
I come from a humble background,

369
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,600
living a tough life alone
with my widowed mother for 20 years.

370
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,080
Others won't understand that.

371
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,400
Daughters of officials and rich merchants

372
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,320
are mostly arrogant and spoiled.

373
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,600
Can they treat my elderly poor mother
with kindness and respect?

374
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,600
No, they can't.

375
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,480
Even if your wealth
rivals that of Shi Chong

376
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,720
and you are as beautiful as a fairy,

377
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,800
you're not the "Meng Guang" I seek.

378
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,040
Fan Lianghan.

379
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,280
Fan Lianghan.

380
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,160
There is no one in there.

381
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,200
Oh no.

382
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,640
Why is she back?

383
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,400
- If she sees us like this…
- Fan Lianghan.

384
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,680
- …I'll have to marry you.
- Where are you?

385
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,040
Master Fan is way too useless.

386
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,840
Are they in there? Step aside.

387
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,880
No, there's no one inside.

388
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,560
Fan Lianghan.

389
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,760
Come out.

390
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,200
- Fan Lianghan.
- My lady.

391
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,400
My lady, I swear there's no one inside.

392
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,400
No one? Then who is she?

393
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,040
Do you take me for a blind or a fool?

394
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,160
How dare you fool me?

395
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,960
Fan Lianghan, you'd better come out now.

396
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,160
It will be worse for you if I catch you.

397
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,680
I'll open the door
and tell her everything.

398
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,880
Liu Baniang.

399
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,600
Who asked Master Fan

400
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,400
to invite me over to paint?

401
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,320
Well…

402
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,000
Still not coming out?

403
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,400
Do I have to search in person?

404
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,480
Fan Lianghan, come out.

405
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,680
Fan Lianghan.

406
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,240
Are you coming out or not?

407
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,160
Fan Lianghan, I'll count to three.

408
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,200
Hide. Go.

409
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,840
- Hurry.
- Fan Lianghan.

410
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,640
Hurry.

411
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,440
Get in.

412
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,560
I have a clear conscience.

413
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,920
- Why should I hide?
- Fan Lianghan.

414
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,840
Please do this for me.
I'm begging you. Get in.

415
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,520
Open up, Fan Lianghan.

416
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,880
Get in.

417
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,040
Yuanming, suit yourself.

418
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,640
Fan Lianghan, open up.

419
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,720
Mr. Chai, what a surprise.

420
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,360
- Fan Lianghan.
- I know what to do.

421
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,120
Okay.

422
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Fan Lianghan.

423
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,240
I know you're in there.

424
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,920
Open up.

425
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,720
Open up.

426
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,320
My lady, he jumped out the window.

427
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,640
- Useless.
- Useless.

428
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,920
Fuhui, please calm down.

429
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,720
Fuhui, there's a reason for this.

430
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,200
It's my fault. Don't blame him.

431
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,560
Find him first.

432
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,480
Have a proper talk.

433
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,480
You'll figure it out.

434
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,160
Yuanming.

435
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,120
Yuanming.

436
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,800
Mr. Chai.

437
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,600
What you did

438
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,680
was really not honorable.

439
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,440
Yuanming, the Chai and Liu families
have long been friends.

440
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,720
And Baniang begged me for help.

441
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,280
I had no choice.

442
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,760
Please forgive me.

443
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,520
I was hiding there
just in case Baniang acted on a whim.

444
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,640
I'm really sorry that we disturbed you.

445
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,440
I will apologize to you formally.

446
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,280
Housekeeper.

447
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,120
Before Fuhui comes back,

448
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,680
hurry up and leave.

449
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,120
- Escort Master Du out.
- Master Du, please.

450
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,120
Yuanming, hurry.

451
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,840
You set me up.

452
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,320
It was such a mess.

453
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,440
You owe me an explanation.

454
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,680
Baniang.

455
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,600
I did all this
to let you talk to Master Du.

456
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,240
You've misunderstood me.

457
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,680
Let's discuss the details later.

458
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,200
Go home first. Hurry.

459
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,160
- I'm dead.
- Master.

460
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,280
I'm dead.

461
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,600
Master, don't be afraid. It's me.

462
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,560
Those two have left.

463
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,320
My lady can't catch them.

464
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,600
That's good.

465
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,200
Who said I was hiding from her?

466
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,520
Why should I be scared?

467
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,440
Even if she is standing right here,

468
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,520
I will…

469
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,040
What will you do?

470
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,760
I made a silly mistake.

471
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,600
As long as I get on my knees and repent,

472
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,040
how can my sweetheart scold me or hit me?

473
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,400
Am I right, honey?

474
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,720
Get up.

475
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,720
Get up.

476
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,040
- You may leave.
- Understood.

477
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,920
Fuhui.

478
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,960
My brother asked me to do this.

479
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,320
Du Yangxi turned down
Liu Baniang for no reason.

480
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,760
She felt humiliated
and insisted on confronting him.

481
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,480
My brother made me do this.

482
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
Look at you.

483
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,680
You make it so much worse by saying that.

484
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,480
You did everything
your brother told you to do.

485
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,240
Don't you know that my mother wants

486
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,960
Du Yangxi to marry into our family?

487
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,200
Have you thought about Kangning?

488
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,280
You always listen to your brother
and never care about me.

489
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,400
How dare you keep me in the dark?

490
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,280
Come here.

491
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,640
Ouch, honey.

492
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,720
Be gentle, honey. It hurts.

493
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,240
Kangning.

494
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,120
What Du Yangxi said might sound sincere,

495
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,600
but it's not completely true.

496
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,000
Ladies from wealthy families

497
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,600
can also uphold filial piety
and moral principles.

498
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,560
I bet he only wants someone
from a poor family for other reasons.

499
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,480
He may fool Liu Baniang,
but he can't fool you.

500
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,280
Your evaluation of Master Du

501
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,680
is entirely speculative
without any solid evidence.

502
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,200
Besides, everyone has their own destiny.

503
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,600
It has nothing to do with him
that we're no longer engaged.

504
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,640
Leave him alone.

505
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,520
It has everything to do with him.

506
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,080
Kangning, you promised to marry me.

507
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,240
You keep pestering me,
unwilling to give up,

508
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,920
merely out of pride
and your reluctance to admit defeat.

509
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,880
You have your pride.

510
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,160
I have my integrity.

511
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,880
I suggest you let be it.

512
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,120
Don't hold on to it.

513
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,720
If he was a nice guy, I would let go.

514
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,920
But judging from what he said and did,

515
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,120
he clearly has ulterior motives.

516
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,920
You can't entrust yourself to him.

517
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,720
No way.

518
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,680
I won't allow it.

519
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,600
Go back. I know what to do.

520
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,720
- Go. Hurry.
- Chai An.

521
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,560
Chai An, since when did you
get to decide my marriage?

522
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,680
Hurry up.

523
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,080
You're too bossy.

524
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,640
Chai An.

525
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,960
Take her home.

526
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,760
Did he really say that?

527
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,520
Judging someone's character
in just a few words

528
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,320
is truly absurd.

529
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,920
Who knows if he's jealous

530
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,400
and trying to destroy your marriage
with some lies?

531
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,000
Master Chai is not that kind of person.

532
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,480
But those two have been living next door
for a long time.

533
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,240
Shouhua, you've read his poems and essays.

534
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,760
Didn't you praise him for his insight
and talent?

535
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,800
You even imitate his writing
because it conceals vigor and spirit.

536
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,360
Even if they are bandits or criminals,

537
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,160
we have neither wealth nor power.

538
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,440
What would they want from us?

539
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,480
Kangning, what do you say?

540
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,560
I can't see through this person.

541
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,440
But it doesn't have to be him.
Isn't there another candidate?

542
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,920
No way.

543
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,120
Forget about it. It won't work.

544
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,360
What hair oil do you use?

545
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,640
I…

546
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,880
Top-quality osmanthus hair oil.

547
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,960
That was the first time I saw a man

548
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,600
throwing up due to the smell of hair oil.

549
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,920
He deserves to remain single forever.

550
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,840
Don't tell anyone about
what happened with Master Du yet.

551
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,160
Don't tell our mother either.

552
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,200
Time reveals people's hearts.

553
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,280
If there is something wrong with him,
we'll find out about it.

554
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,440
Let's wait a bit.

555
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,040
Your mother and I are best friends.

556
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,840
You would follow her here

557
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,920
when you were a kid and run behind An'er.

558
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,400
I haven't seen you for years.

559
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,200
You've grown into such a stunning beauty.

560
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,320
So dazzling.

561
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,600
I heard you often traveled
with your father.

562
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,400
He is so muddle-headed.

563
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,640
How can he let you run around in public
in the prime of youth?

564
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,400
Now, Chai An has grown up.

565
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,280
Your mother mentioned it to me yesterday.

566
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,520
Fine, I'll stop right here.

567
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,000
I'll discuss it with your mother.

568
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,640
Madam, the young master is back.

569
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,960
Mother.

570
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,000
An'er, you've come back just in time.

571
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,280
Sit with Baniang.

572
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,600
The servants don't know
what Baniang likes.

573
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,320
I will tell them what snacks to get.

574
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,280
Don't bother, Mother. Let me do it.

575
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,800
Let me do it.

576
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,240
You grew up together
like siblings. Don't be shy.

577
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,240
- Mother.
- Sit down.

578
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,400
Deqing.

579
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,600
Chai An, you said you would do me justice,

580
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,640
but in fact, you served your own purpose.

581
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,960
Du Yangxi outright refused you,
which made you upset for a long time.

582
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,720
You insisted on seeing him,
so I helped out.

583
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,320
I just brought along another onlooker,

584
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,120
but I helped you,
so you have to help me too.

585
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,960
You're always straightforward.
Why do you mind it?

586
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,440
You…

587
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,720
You're really going to lengths
for Li Kangning.

588
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,840
But I can tell

589
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,000
that your mother wants me
as her daughter-in-law.

590
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,920
I'm afraid all your efforts
have been in vain.

591
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,320
Baniang.

592
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,600
You've seen the painting
and met him in person.

593
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,480
Du Yangxi truly stands out
with his literary grace and charm.

594
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,200
Aren't you any attracted?

595
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,240
My marriage is entirely up to my parents.

596
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,720
I'm just a young lady.
I have no say in this matter.

597
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,520
- Alright then, forget it.
- Chai An.

598
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,600
You have an idea?

599
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,280
This man is quite elusive.

600
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,000
But we're not a powerless
ordinary family in Bianjing.

601
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,360
Even if he has a thousand tricks,
I can deal with them.

602
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,120
What is there to fear?

603
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,840
But your mother wants
a marital alliance so badly.

604
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,080
How is Du Yangxi…

605
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,520
As long as you follow my plan,
within ten days,

606
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,920
my mother will change her mind.

607
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,520
Even Master Du will turn to pursue you.

608
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,840
- Deal.
- Deal.

609
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,600
PAN RESTAURANT

610
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,480
- This is infuriating. That diviner!
- Sister.

611
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,040
It was just a divination.

612
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,560
Why did you get enraged?

613
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,200
Mr. Wang, the diviner,

614
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,080
said that the Chai and Liu families

615
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,800
couldn't form a marital alliance.

616
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,760
And he dared to curse my son
with a life of solitude.

617
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,680
I was magnanimous
for not smashing his things

618
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,000
on the spot.

619
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,520
But he read your fortune

620
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,560
and wrote down what had happened to you.

621
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,880
Everything he wrote was accurate.

622
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,320
I bet he learned those from Lianghan.

623
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,440
Even your son doesn't know
that you went missing when you were six

624
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,320
and were found later.

625
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,480
How can the diviner cheat?

626
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,200
He's just wrong.

627
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,520
No one can ruin the marriage
between my son and Liu Baniang.

628
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,160
I must try someone else.

629
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,440
Madam.

630
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,560
Has Lady Liu arrived?

631
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,560
The Liu family said

632
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,200
that the shaft of Lady Liu's carriage
broke right after she left home.

633
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,360
Lady Liu thought it was a bad sign,

634
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,040
so she headed back
and sent someone to apologize.

635
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,440
What? It broke?

636
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,840
You see?

637
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,560
Madam, bad news.

638
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,960
- An'er.
- Mother.

639
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,840
An'er, what's happened?

640
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,680
How did you get hurt?

641
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,080
I was coming back from work.

642
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,000
The horse went crazy
and started running wild

643
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,960
for no reason.

644
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,920
Thankfully, no one else was hurt.

645
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,560
Mother, don't worry.

646
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,520
It's nothing serious.

647
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,720
Hurry. Apply some medicine.

648
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,800
That's right. Hurry up.

649
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,000
- Find a physician.
- Understood.

650
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,600
I hope you do not take offense.

651
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,960
Your son is afflicted by the Lonely Star.

652
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,080
His marital fate suffers.

653
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,680
Even if you find him a wife,

654
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,560
in as little as one month
or half a year tops,

655
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,520
a calamity will surely befall.

656
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,480
There will be blood.

657
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,080
There was someone
with great energy in her fortune

658
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,240
that could suppress his Lonely Star.

659
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,440
It's a pity
that the marital tie was severed

660
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,640
before it was formed.

661
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,680
It's both timing and fate.

662
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,640
Oh no.

663
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,680
I shouldn't have canceled the engagement.

664
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,160
You are truly ruthless.
How did you manage to do this?

665
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,680
The wound looks terrifying.

666
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,120
Madam watched
the physician give a prescription

667
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,440
and left in a hurry.

668
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,080
We don't know where she went.

669
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,440
I know where she went.

670
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,840
Any news from the people I sent to Ezhou?

671
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,000
A message has come.

672
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,520
The person was found and put on a boat.

673
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,480
- Do not come again.
- Madam Li.

674
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,800
- Madam Li.
- Go away.

675
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,360
- Madam Li.
- Get out.

676
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,520
Take these back.

677
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,000
The Chai family is wealthy
and influential,

678
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,000
with good farmland and great business.

679
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,760
Their wealth and honor are unmatched.

680
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,640
My family only runs a small tea stall
with one storefront.

681
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,040
We're no match for them in social status.

682
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,560
The son of the Chai family
is the best young man in the world.

683
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,240
He's one of a kind.

684
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,200
But my daughter is just a village girl

685
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,760
who lacks proper upbringing and manners.

686
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,000
She's no match for that young man.

687
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,400
Whoever wants to cling

688
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,200
to this wealthy and powerful family,
go ahead.

689
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,120
Even if they come begging me,

690
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,120
- I won't bother seeing them.
- Madam Li.

691
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,680
Madam Chai deeply regrets her decision.

692
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,600
She has long changed her mind.

693
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,600
So, she sent us here to apologize,

694
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,840
hoping that
you'll overlook past grievances and renew

695
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,920
the marital tie between the two families.

696
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,040
She is totally sincere.

697
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,480
Such nice in-laws are hard to find.

698
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,160
Even if you are holding a grudge,

699
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,880
you should think about your daughter.

700
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,560
Yeah, take a look.

701
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,360
These are all good stuff.

702
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,280
Good stuff?

703
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,240
Good stuff?

704
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,920
What good stuff?

705
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,960
They despise the poor
and admire the rich.

706
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,640
They're the worst of the worst.

707
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,920
The worst.

708
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,840
When I marry off my daughter,

709
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,800
I won't care about status or wealth.

710
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,880
I will find her a good family
valuing education and integrity.

711
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,240
The Chai family came back
to ask for my daughter?

712
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,440
In their dreams!

713
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,640
Go away.

714
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,920
Take it away!

715
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,840
Go away.

716
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,600
Madam Li.

717
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,520
Madam Li.

718
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,280
- Madam Li.
- If you dare to come again,

719
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,600
I'll kick you out! Close the door.

720
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
Madam Li.

721
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,280
Madam Li. Open up.

722
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,560
Why did they close the door?

723
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,960
- Madam Li.
- Madam Li.

724
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,160
You always outshine bright colors.
Beautiful.

725
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,560
Your goose-yellow gown is also pretty.

726
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,160
It looks cheerful in winter.

727
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,360
But the waist is a bit loose.

728
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,400
Mother wants to fill the quilts
with new cotton for our neighbors.

729
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,880
I was too busy to modify my clothes.

730
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,440
Give it to me. I'll help.

731
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,480
Just don't get your hair oil on it.

732
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,760
Or someone may end up puking in his sleep.

733
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,200
That's going to be tiring.

734
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,960
The Chai family came back
to ask for my daughter?

735
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,240
In their dreams!

736
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,040
Close the door. Get lost.

737
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:16,000
Shouhua, I only improvised the "get lost".

738
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,200
The rest are her exact words.

739
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,000
Why didn't you pay attention?

740
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,040
You didn't see
our mother's awe-inspiring stance.

741
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,160
So imposing.

742
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,800
They deserve it.

743
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,520
Why did the Chai family
put on air and bully us

744
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,680
in the beginning?

745
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,480
He first invited Kangning to eavesdrop
and made Madam Chai change her mind.

746
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,360
Master Chai seems determined

747
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,760
to win Kangning back at all costs.

748
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,680
But it's not easy to change the mindset
of disdaining the poor.

749
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,320
If Madam Chai
changes her mind again one day,

750
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,240
then our family
will be utterly humiliated.

751
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,480
Mr. Chai is so used
to calling the shots alone.

752
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,920
He decides to get engaged and back out
whenever he wants,

753
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,960
treating me like his pet or toy,

754
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,000
who doesn't have a say.

755
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,080
I will decide whom to marry.

756
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,640
If he insists on meddling,
then I won't let him off.

757
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,320
You've seen the fanciest accessories.

758
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,440
I wouldn't dare offer anything ordinary.

759
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,680
I handpicked the special ones
just for you.

760
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,880
This cloisonné flower tube hairpin
may seem simple,

761
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,400
but the flare is great
for holding flowers.

762
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,640
You…

763
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,200
We've received so many proposals
from Bianjing,

764
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,920
even to the Daming prefecture.

765
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,280
I'm so swamped.

766
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,640
Here are their birthdays.

767
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,600
Please take a look and find the best fit.

768
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,120
Madam.

769
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,560
XINHAI JIAXU YISI GUISI

770
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,240
Li Kangning. I knew it.

771
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,480
It is the will of heaven.

772
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,040
Even the parents shall not resist it.

773
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,720
If you don't take my advice…

774
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,000
What if I don't take your advice?

775
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,760
- Turn this upside down.
- Wait.

776
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,360
Please don't.

777
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,480
- Capture him.
- Please don't.

778
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,880
I tested you to see if you were authentic.

779
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,160
You wrote a few lines
and dropped the paper.

780
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,560
Then you asked me about my past.

781
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,600
Even if you didn't get anything right,

782
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,400
the boy under the table would fix it.

783
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,840
How could it not be accurate?

784
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,720
It's nothing but a lie!

785
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,240
Madam Chai.

786
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,680
Master Chai orchestrated this.

787
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,600
I just did what he told me to do.

788
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,920
My lady, please spare me.

789
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,840
Madam Chai, please spare me.

790
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,000
FINE WINE PRODUCED BY PAN RESTAURANT

791
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,080
DELICACIES AND TOP QUALITY DRINKS

792
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,160
Master.

793
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,680
Gentlemen, please come in.

794
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,520
I see.

795
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,280
Bring the horse. I'm going to the port.

796
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,520
Hurry up.

797
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,640
But what about Madam?

798
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,560
Let her be.

799
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,640
Master.

800
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,200
Master, I rushed to the port
as you ordered, but nobody was there.

801
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,600
You didn't find her?

802
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,560
What about the guards?

803
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,480
Liu's merchant ship
should have arrived by midday,

804
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,240
but I saw no trace of the ship.

805
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,280
I didn't want to keep you waiting,

806
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,080
so I told the others to stay
and came back alone.

807
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,120
Oh no.

808
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,000
Liu Baniang.

809
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,760
Why did you go back on your word?

810
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,160
You agreed to my plan.

811
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,760
Yet you sold me out.

812
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,400
What makes you say that?

813
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,840
The diviner has been in this profession
for over a decade

814
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,480
and rarely slips up.

815
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,080
But my mother saw through his tricks.

816
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,600
Before that, she had been
scammed out of a fortune every year.

817
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,120
The person I found should have arrived
but vanished.

818
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,840
And it just happened
that they boarded your merchant ship.

819
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,400
Liu Baniang. Tell me. Where is she?

820
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,600
Chai An.

821
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,520
Sorry, I have let you down.

822
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,720
She's with the Li family?

823
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,880
- Welcome our guest.
- Understood.

824
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,040
Madam Du, please step out of the sedan.

825
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,360
Master Du is good-looking,
graceful, and elegant.

826
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,200
How come his mother looks like this?

827
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,600
Haode, why do you sound so judgmental?

828
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,800
That's not what I meant.

829
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,960
They don't look alike.

830
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,200
MADAM DU

831
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,160
She doesn't look like his mother.

832
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,080
She's more like his grandmother.

833
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,560
Let's go.

834
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,160
Sister, here.

835
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,680
Please enjoy.

836
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,800
You're too kind. How do I deserve this?

837
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,680
Here's the spoon.

838
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,280
Be careful. It's hot.

839
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,160
Good girl.

840
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,600
Thank you.

841
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,960
What did Li Kangning offer you?

842
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,440
She told me…

843
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,960
If you marry Master Du,
even if he passes the exam

844
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,480
and gets appointed to the Hanlin Academy
or to an external post,

845
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,920
his salary will be meager,
and you'll live a modest life.

846
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,640
It may be fine to use up your dowry,

847
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,920
but you may have to imitate
Meng Guang from ancient times,

848
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,400
remove all the accessories,

849
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,360
change into worn-out clothes,

850
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,480
and look after your mother-in-law.

851
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,480
How can a single young lady
say such things?

852
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,560
Merchants value profit over anything else.

853
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,040
I can't say such things to the others.

854
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,440
But I can to you.

855
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,480
But I can't marry Chai An either.

856
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,760
He is so shrewd.

857
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,680
I won't be able
to take any advantage of him.

858
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,440
Except for scholars and cunning merchants,

859
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,800
don't you have other options?

860
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,600
She changed your mind
with just a few words?

861
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,840
I don't believe it.

862
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,800
Who did she recommend?

863
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,520
All my elder sisters are married.

864
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,840
My younger brother is only nine.

865
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,000
I'll get a lot more
if someone marries into my family.

866
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,120
Thankfully, Kangning reminded me.

867
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,040
I didn't see the whole picture.

868
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,080
The problem is you won't make it.

869
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,040
Let's see whether she teaches you
how to convince your father

870
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,640
to keep you at home.

871
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,720
My dear brother.

872
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,120
Merchants often pursue profit
over righteousness.

873
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,000
I grew up observing what the merchants do

874
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,560
and learned to be
obsessed with wealth better than anyone.

875
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,520
It's not that I want to betray you.

876
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,160
It's really just my nature.

877
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,800
Whoever offers me the most benefits,

878
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,720
I will naturally follow their lead
without any second thoughts.

879
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,920
Well played, Li Kangning.

880
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,760
How dare you stab me in my back?

881
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,760
Despicable.

882
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,360
So despicable.

883
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,600
Chai An?

884
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,360
Chai An!

885
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,360
