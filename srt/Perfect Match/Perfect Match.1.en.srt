00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,440
EPISODE 1

2
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,440
REIGN OF RENZONG
IN THE NORTHERN SONG DYNASTY

3
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,200
Boss, give me one that's fresh and hot.

4
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,520
It smells pretty good.

5
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,760
BIANJING

6
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,680
Just a moment.

7
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,400
- Alright, I'll take those then.
- Okay.

8
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,640
Sesame oil. Top-quality sesame oil.

9
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,560
- Steamed buns.
- Sesame oil.

10
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,840
Nice and hot.

11
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,880
Peanut cake.

12
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,320
Come take a look.

13
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,920
Let's get this one.

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,880
- Nice and hot.
- Here you go.

15
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,080
PAN RESTAURANT

16
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,680
- Welcome!
- They have a new owner now.

17
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,560
- Does Pan Restaurant sell Penglai Chun?
- Yes, it does.

18
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,000
When it comes to good wine,

19
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,880
the Meishou
from Baifan Restaurant is the best.

20
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,360
Let's give it a try.

21
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,520
Let's go.

22
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,920
Waiter, table for three.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,320
Three gentlemen, please come.

24
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,400
I can't feel my arms with you there.
Get up.

25
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,480
MADAM LI

26
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,320
ELDEST DAUGHTER, SHOUHUA

27
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,280
Come on. Brush your teeth.

28
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,600
Mom is really stingy.

29
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,800
Why not hire a sedan chair
to go into the city?

30
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,880
It's both convenient and respectable.

31
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,760
So noisy.

32
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,320
You're stepping on me.

33
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,760
FIFTH DAUGHTER, LESHAN

34
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,840
- Stop it. The vehicle is shaking.
- Quick.

35
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,040
Oil spilled out.

36
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,160
- Okay.
- You.

37
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,200
Mom.

38
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,200
Stop fooling around. Hurry.
There's hair oil left.

39
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,560
- Come on.
- Only quiet when you're all asleep.

40
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,080
- She's stepping on me.
- Don't move.

41
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,680
Don't mention those darn people anymore.

42
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,680
In broad daylight,

43
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,080
they start daydreaming.

44
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,800
They ask for 120 coins right off the bat.

45
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,000
A hundred and twenty coins, seriously?

46
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,920
Later, when we arrive
at your second sister's house,

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,880
all the sedans
are yours to sit on if you like.

48
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,160
No wonder everyone says

49
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,960
Bianjing's splendor's
unrivaled in the world.

50
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,080
Sister,

51
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,480
look at that door.
They've even put up a decorative arch.

52
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,160
There are many ladies
with flowers in the hair on the pavilion.

53
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,280
Over here.

54
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,240
- Let me have a look.
- Careful with the oil.

55
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,800
- Your skirt.
- Be careful.

56
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,800
Can you be a bit more mature?

57
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,600
Pancakes.

58
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,320
Here, kind guest. Have one.

59
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,320
MADAM LIU, CHUNLAI

60
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,880
QIONGNU

61
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,400
PAN RESTAURANT

62
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,320
Sis.

63
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Look over there.
Someone is gorgeously dressed.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,080
Isn't it new?

65
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,920
Can we wear something like that
in the future?

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,600
- Ask Mother.
- Let's settle down in Bianjing first.

67
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,720
Then, I will find each of you
a good husband.

68
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,360
I will have no regrets after that.

69
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,560
CHAI AN

70
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,800
- LIANG JUNQING
- My lord.

71
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
Enjoy your meal, my lord.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,440
I'll be right outside.
Just call if you need anything.

73
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,120
In this city, only Master Chai has wealth
worth 10,000 strings of coin.

74
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,760
In the blink of an eye,
he took over such a large shop.

75
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,800
But I heard the old owner has suffered
great losses for three consecutive years.

76
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,800
Lost a lot of wealth.

77
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,440
You faint-hearted ones.

78
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,240
What kind of person is Master Chai?

79
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,200
News was shared from the Palace.

80
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,520
Whoever takes on the 20,000-gold
liquor taxes from Pan Restaurant

81
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,280
will be authorized to open
1,000 liquor stores.

82
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,480
You'll never need to worry about cash

83
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,280
as it flows in like water.

84
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,240
That'd be fantastic.

85
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,240
Ordinary people might never get the news.

86
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,880
Even if they knew,
who would have the nerve to execute?

87
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,000
Right.

88
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,920
Are you afraid of the cold?

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,240
The windows are all shut,

90
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,520
yet you're not taking it off.

91
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,960
You're not a lady.

92
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,440
A grown man going out wearing this?

93
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,080
I was stung by a bee yesterday

94
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,640
and got such a big swelling.

95
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,960
I don't want to ruin the view.

96
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,280
I am ashamed.

97
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,120
I drank too much last night

98
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,800
and took a tumble.

99
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,360
Scared of being mocked
for being drunk.

100
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,440
I hope you all will forgive me for this.

101
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,080
No worries.

102
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,080
Everyone, out.

103
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,320
Out!

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I…

105
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,800
Put it down.

106
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,880
Such a big bee.

107
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,280
- Was it your wife again?
- No, no.

108
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,920
I was drunk last night
and got a bit intimate with the maid.

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,080
FAN LIANGHAN

110
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,240
My lady was angry, and we argued.

111
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,960
I fell off the bed. But it's alright.

112
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,120
You're so useless.

113
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,840
- Let's go.
- Where to?

114
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,560
I must personally meet your shrewish wife.

115
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,800
Absolutely not, if you provoke her,

116
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,720
she might just eat you up.

117
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,520
FAN’S MANSION

118
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,480
What bad timing.

119
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,240
Our master and mistress
are away for the summer holidays.

120
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,480
They are not at home.

121
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,080
Please inform your master

122
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,840
that his wife's family
has traveled far from Luoyang to visit.

123
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,040
He has gone to meet friends.

124
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,720
Then, when will he be back?

125
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,920
At noon, he is usually at Sang's house.
Night entertainment after that.

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,200
We wouldn't know when he will be back.

127
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,240
- What's the matter?
- What does she mean?

128
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,080
Then, please take the trouble to go again

129
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,560
and tell our second lady
to come out and greet.

130
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,840
She's gone to Xiangguo Temple
for charity events.

131
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,400
Sorry for the trouble, madam.

132
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,680
Please come again another day.

133
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,920
Alright. Heading back.

134
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,320
Sweep this away. How unpleasant to see.

135
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,640
Madam, what are you doing?

136
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,000
Not yesterday,

137
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,520
nor tomorrow.

138
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Such a coincidence.

139
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,080
We just arrived and everyone is out.

140
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,600
It seems my mail was addressed to a dog.

141
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,080
Madam,

142
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,480
please don't be mad.
They are not at home, really.

143
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,920
Go back and tell your master.

144
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,280
When my second girl was back home,

145
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,440
we always greeted distant guests
with proper manners.

146
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,040
We never let them linger at the door,

147
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,520
waiting without even a cup of tea.
This is nonsense.

148
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,800
Our girl joined the Fan family
less than two years ago.

149
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,600
She now turned her back
on her widowed mother and sisters.

150
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,080
This is not marriage.

151
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,680
This is uncivilized downgrading
to savages.

152
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,920
As for that one,

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,280
with an evil heart and rotten guts,

154
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,280
I'll just assume I was blind
and raised them for nothing.

155
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,520
You just go back and tell her.

156
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,720
Even if I have to beg for food
from now on,

157
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,480
I will never come here,
at the doorstep of the Fan family.

158
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,680
Let's go.

159
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,680
- But…
- No need.

160
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,000
- What?
- Let's go.

161
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,160
FAN’S MANSION

162
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,840
SECOND DAUGHTER, FUHUI

163
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,480
Mother.

164
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,440
It's pitiful.

165
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,760
Pity for my…

166
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,240
200 strings dowry.

167
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,040
Two hundred strings?

168
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,840
FAN'S MANSION

169
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,160
It's getting dark.

170
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,280
Time to rest.

171
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,360
You want to stay over?

172
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
- Take off your clothes.
- My lord.

173
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,320
I mean, I want to borrow your clothes.

174
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,440
Mother, don't be angry.

175
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,400
Second sister may have her own concerns.

176
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,840
Mother, a decoction to calm your nerves.

177
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,920
Have some at least.

178
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,360
Raised for nothing.

179
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,960
Really. Nothing.

180
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,000
Terribly ungrateful.

181
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,920
A beast without gratitude.

182
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,160
Come.

183
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,320
Take these 200 coins.

184
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,200
Buy some donkey meat pastries,

185
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,080
some mung bean soup,

186
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,480
and some grass jelly to cool off.

187
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,960
I am afraid Mom has no appetite.

188
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,600
That stove looks rather clean to me.

189
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,000
Please also borrow some rice.

190
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,360
Ask Chunlai to make some rice porridge.

191
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,720
We'll settle
the fire-lighting fee tomorrow.

192
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,400
Do you know the way?

193
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,720
Mother has a picky taste.

194
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,320
You can go to Zhang's for pastries,
right across the street.

195
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,800
Turn right and keep going
until you get to Second Street.

196
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,800
With another hundred steps,
you'll see Wang's fish noodle stall.

197
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,320
On the east side of the stall,
there is a Lucky Shoe Store.

198
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,480
Next to it, Lin family's grass jelly
has a long queue. Buy from there.

199
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,360
I wasn't able to see clear
during the bumpy ride.

200
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,960
But thank you, my fourth lady.
You have a good memory.

201
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,320
I'll go then.

202
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,960
Mother.

203
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,280
It's cold.

204
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,120
Where is third lady?

205
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,280
They said Master Chai

206
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,040
invited quite a few people over,

207
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,160
playing and singing.
The noise is incessant.

208
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,160
Later on, he was too drunk to walk.

209
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,520
He had to be carried back.

210
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,480
What about my husband?

211
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,400
The young master stayed with a girl

212
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,760
in the side chamber.

213
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,480
That naughty piece of shit.

214
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,640
My lady.

215
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,880
My lady.

216
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,360
Fan Lianghan, you did take a vow.

217
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,440
Can't believe such a violent wife
is from the Li family of Luoyang.

218
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,080
Your late father
must be restless in his grave.

219
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,640
A saying goes,

220
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,960
"The violent one is heartless.
The ugly one envies."

221
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,640
Five daughters from Luoyang Li family
are all famous for beauty.

222
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,080
You are not ugly or heartless.

223
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,360
Why so jealous?

224
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,640
It should be between you two.
I never intended to do this.

225
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,200
But you hit and scold your husband,
making domestic issues known all over.

226
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,200
He is my cousin. I can't just ignore it.

227
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,520
Marrying a good husband
should be a great thing in life.

228
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,280
I advise you, sister-in-law.

229
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,560
From now on, put away
this envy for favor and vanity.

230
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,240
Don't break the seven rules for divorce

231
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,640
out of temper and jealousy.

232
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,800
Ending up a divorced and discarded woman
will bring disgrace to your Li family.

233
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,320
Come out!

234
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,880
Cousin, is that all?

235
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,800
If Auntie hasn't begged me to,
I won't bother with your trivial matters.

236
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,640
You two are never at peace.

237
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,400
If she makes one mistake, you make nine.

238
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,920
Her fierce and jealous nature,
I bet you've driven her to it.

239
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,600
Fan Lianghan,

240
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,560
if you dare fool around outside again
and word gets back to me,

241
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,480
you'll get a hundred flogging.
If you die, fine.

242
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,000
Cousin,

243
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,960
I just look and talk about it.
I've never been serious about it.

244
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,920
My wife is too fierce.

245
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,960
Whenever a mosquito flies by,

246
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,400
she has to catch it to check the gender.

247
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,880
- Cousin.
- You're driving me crazy.

248
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,240
I'll walk around. Do not follow.

249
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,840
Go back.

250
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,320
<i>From now on, put away</i>
<i>this envy for favor and vanity.</i>

251
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,040
<i>Don't break the seven rules for divorce</i>

252
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,520
<i>out of temper and jealousy.</i>

253
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,760
<i>Ending up a divorced</i>
<i>and discarded woman</i>

254
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,320
<i>will bring disgrace to your Li family.</i>

255
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,720
Second sister.

256
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,520
Kneel.

257
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,320
In front of the sisters,

258
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,760
share your thoughts.

259
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,160
Make it clear.

260
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
Madam.

261
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,280
Second lady has suffered a lot.

262
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,080
Second sister.

263
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,960
When I first joined the Fan family,

264
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,760
I was also favored by Mother-in-law.

265
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,280
We were a harmonious couple.

266
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,320
But as time went by,

267
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,960
I found out Fan's eldest son
was soft-hearted.

268
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,320
Those companions in the parlor.

269
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,640
Strange girls playing flute and lute.

270
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,000
Everyone was his favorite.

271
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,960
Whoever cries about life in front of him,

272
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,120
he would cry along with them.

273
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,600
Often with red and swollen eyes,

274
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,120
he came back with an empty purse.

275
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,160
The elders pity their son.

276
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,600
Told him off a few of times,
but he never changed.

277
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
They just gave up on him.

278
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,320
What is this?

279
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,080
But it is not true if you say
he treats me poorly.

280
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,720
The beaded treasures
and curios in my room,

281
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,720
the royal girls might not have them.

282
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,640
I wanted to learn to play Dakyu.

283
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,880
He helped me a lot

284
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,720
by organizing teams and clubs.

285
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,960
In March, he took me to play water swings.

286
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,920
He fell down from a high place,

287
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,600
almost losing his life,

288
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,120
all for me and my smile.

289
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,480
Perhaps I am too jealous

290
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,360
to be a virtuous wife.

291
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,960
Don't give me excuses.

292
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,200
I'm asking you.

293
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,080
What is this?

294
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,120
Chewing pebbles to overcome jealousy.

295
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,760
Mother.

296
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,320
I don't want to resort to violence.

297
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,720
A bad reputation spreads far and wide.
But I…

298
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,840
can never change it.

299
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,760
Oh, Fuhui.

300
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,680
Second sister is afraid of being a burden
on the Li family, on us.

301
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,200
That's why she refused to meet us today.

302
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,080
What are you talking about?

303
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,120
No, it is true.

304
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,920
Six fierce ladies of the Li Family
scared off all the matchmakers in Luoyang.

305
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,360
If word spread in Bianjing
about another envious Li's girl,

306
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,480
it'll be unbearably worse.

307
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,360
I thought it was a big deal,

308
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,560
like the end of the world.

309
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,040
Among these five girls,

310
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,280
you are the most alike
to your weakling muddle-headed father.

311
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,480
Mother, you don't want me to bear it?

312
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,040
Enduring is a temporary approach.

313
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,440
But we are here now.

314
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,360
We will make him change
instead of you tolerating everything.

315
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,200
Third sister means that
looking back, families were ruined

316
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,080
by too much drink,
lust, wealth, and anger.

317
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,240
Excessive drinking and lust

318
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,680
lead to gossip and quarrels,

319
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,600
even to physical injuries and murder.

320
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,880
There are countless cases in the world.

321
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,360
Brother-in-law is young and impetuous.

322
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,640
It is good for him to cultivate morals
and avoid disputes.

323
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,360
If you are afraid of the gossip

324
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,400
and indulge him blindly,

325
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,240
it will lead to trouble in the future.

326
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,560
That is not virtuous after all.

327
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,440
Then, sister, what should I do?

328
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,480
Tackling the root of the problem
is not difficult.

329
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,520
I'm afraid that second sister won't do it.

330
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,000
I will.

331
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,400
As long as it is good for him,

332
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
I will do anything.

333
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,480
Then, no problem.

334
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,960
If you follow my advice,
within half a year,

335
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,040
if you tell him to go east,
he will never go west.

336
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,160
Tell him to hold the plow,
he won't climb the ladder.

337
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,640
He will become a compliant
and obedient husband.

338
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,880
No, he will be a down-to-earth husband

339
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,760
who earnestly mends his ways.

340
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,480
All the same.

341
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,320
Second sister,
with your beauty and virtue,

342
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,120
he should do nothing but cherish you.

343
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,880
If I were you, I'd beat him up and see
what's in his silly brain.

344
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,240
Starting from today,

345
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,080
he shall see the magic of our third lady.

346
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,560
FAN'S MANSION

347
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,480
My lord. My lord.

348
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,560
My lord.

349
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,640
The lady left a message.

350
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,320
Your mother-in-law and sisters
have arrived in Bianjing.

351
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,080
Today they want to visit our silk store
to pick some fabric.

352
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,120
My lord, please stay at home

353
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,800
and prepare a good banquet.

354
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,120
What did you just say? Say it again.

355
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,560
Fan Lianghan.

356
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,680
Cousin, you are here.

357
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,040
Didn't you say yesterday,

358
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,280
the Zhuang's new store has taken
a lot of your customers?

359
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,000
I am free today. I can go with you.

360
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,000
Let's see what tricks
they are playing secretly.

361
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,000
Get up.

362
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,680
Behave yourself. Have you forgotten
what I told you some days ago?

363
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
Cousin.

364
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,680
My wife is not at home today.

365
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,040
My wife is not at home today.

366
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,880
My lord.

367
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,080
The lady has returned.

368
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,720
Hurry. Go.

369
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,720
Quick. Hurry up.

370
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,960
Go, go, go.

371
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,000
There's no time.

372
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,480
There's no time.

373
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,560
It's too late. The lady has returned.

374
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,120
Where can I hide?

375
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,720
Where can I hide?

376
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,280
The lady has returned.

377
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,680
Here.

378
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,160
Get out.

379
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,600
No.

380
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,720
Cousin.

381
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,600
- Cousin, save me.
- Get up.

382
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,360
- Save me, please.
- Stand up.

383
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,560
Don't embarrass me.

384
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,080
My dear,

385
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,800
I have something important to tell you.

386
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,520
This is the symptom of a migraine.

387
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,640
Why is the doctor not here yet?

388
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,440
The doctor is informed
and will be here soon.

389
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,720
My lord, please bear it a bit.

390
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,040
Hurry up.

391
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,520
- My lady.
- What happened?

392
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,160
It hurts terribly, my lady.

393
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,200
Help!

394
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,600
It hurts.

395
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,920
Pain.

396
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,640
Pain.

397
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,040
My lady.

398
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,000
You must've been drinking too much.

399
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,880
Returned at night
and caught in the wind again.

400
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,640
People often get sick by doing that.

401
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,880
Fortunately, it is not difficult to cure.

402
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,360
No need for a doctor. I can treat it.

403
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,120
I wonder,
what kind of treatment are you preparing?

404
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,600
Coming.

405
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,800
My lady, the medicine is here.

406
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,360
Come, my lord.
I will personally attend to you.

407
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,920
Cousin Chai, rest assured.

408
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,360
Once this medicine is taken,
it will cure all ailments.

409
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,920
I've never heard of a medicine
that cures all diseases in this world.

410
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,720
Is this really right?

411
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,520
Indeed. Come on. Drink this first.

412
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,960
What is this taste?

413
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,240
My lord, this is a local remedy.

414
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,240
Boy's urine. Specifically
for treating chills, fever, and headaches.

415
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,280
Just bear with it.

416
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,480
Hurry over and serve the lord.

417
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,520
Go quickly.

418
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,640
Come.

419
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,920
If the lord refuses to take the medicine,
I wonder, are you faking the pain?

420
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,160
- No.
- Not drinking?

421
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,600
I'll drink.

422
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,000
Here.

423
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,200
Blame yourself for that.

424
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,280
Finish it all.

425
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,680
- It will all be fine.
- Who's there?

426
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,120
Alright,
just spit it out and you'll be fine.

427
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,400
Boy's urine?

428
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,800
Third sister, is it really boy's urine?

429
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,640
Of course not.

430
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,920
It's just vinegar with water.

431
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,520
Plus five spoons salt, six spoons
soy sauce, and three sugars.

432
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,320
Among our five sisters,

433
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,560
you are the most mischievous one.
Almost scared my brother-in-law to death.

434
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,520
Third sister is always clever and crafty.

435
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,800
If you ask me,

436
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,680
this libertine's problem
is the easiest to fix.

437
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,080
Just break his legs.

438
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,480
Tie him to the second sister's bedpost,
and he'll behave.

439
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,960
Just eat.

440
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,480
In Bianjing, I am alone and with no help.

441
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,200
Now, mother and sisters came.

442
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,600
You are my core and support.

443
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,000
It feels good.

444
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,680
Two gentlemen.

445
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,640
Young master is at the study.
This way, please.

446
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
Let's go.

447
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,400
Wait.

448
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,640
Who is inside the pavilion?

449
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,200
- Our young lady's family came to visit.
- Let me see.

450
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,400
Those are Fan's beautiful cousins.
They came to the capital.

451
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,600
I heard Fan praised them a lot,
saying they have unmatched beauty.

452
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,440
As if they are goddesses
living in seclusion.

453
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,760
Here, take a look.

454
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,640
That's rare.

455
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,440
I think we should go and pay a visit.

456
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,760
Pay a visit.

457
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,800
Absolutely not, sir.

458
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,640
Won't make it hard for you.
Just have a look.

459
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,800
Just a quick glance.

460
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,560
No, please. You can't do it.

461
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,440
Here, let me pour you a little more.

462
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,120
From such a distance,

463
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,480
we can't see their faces clearly.

464
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,200
Who knows if they are beautiful or not?

465
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,120
Yes, two gentlemen.

466
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,840
You can't get any closer.

467
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,280
If we get caught
for peeking at the ladies,

468
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,320
not just us,

469
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,160
the young master would be in trouble.

470
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,080
Quiet down.

471
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,280
I have an idea.

472
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,760
This is unacceptable.

473
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,120
I visit here often.
Sooner or later, I will meet the ladies.

474
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,520
If you make a fuss,
I'll say you instigated it.

475
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,800
I…

476
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,800
I have prepared the rooms.

477
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,800
Why don't you stay?

478
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,960
Help me talk to Mom, please?

479
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,920
Here, it is Fan's Mansion, not Li's.

480
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,960
It is not proper for you unmarried sisters

481
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,080
to stay long and treat
this as your original house.

482
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,600
That will be a joke for all.

483
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,440
Moreover, if relatives from
the maternal home stay long at your place,

484
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,760
the Fan family will later

485
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,760
look down on you.

486
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,600
What?

487
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,360
Why are you laughing without reason?

488
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,680
A few days ago, I saw a joke in a book.

489
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,120
It's funny but rather vulgar.

490
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,720
I'm afraid to offend my sisters.

491
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,360
I'll just keep it to myself
and enjoy it alone.

492
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,800
I know you.

493
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,520
If you don't say it, you will get gloomy.
Get it off your chest.

494
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,160
- Share it now.
- Do tell.

495
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,160
Well, then. I'll start.

496
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,200
In the grand scheme of things,
nothing's more paltry than ants and flies.

497
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,720
One day, however, they started to argue.

498
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,440
The ant said, "Though I am small,

499
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,800
there's a sense of sovereignty
and servitude in my behavior.

500
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,520
When I find food,

501
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,440
I will surely share with others.

502
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,680
As for loyalty and filial piety,
I shall take the lead."

503
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,920
The fly was not convinced.

504
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,800
"That's all well, but none enjoys as I do.
In the imperial palaces and gardens,

505
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,000
the mansions of the wealthy,

506
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,480
and during grand feasts,

507
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,720
I can enter and roam at will

508
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,920
and enjoy freely.
I should be the leader."

509
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,440
Upon hearing this, the mosquito
expressed its dissent.

510
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,760
"Though you two speak of loyalty,
filial piety, and wealth,

511
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,000
none of you lives as joyfully
and freely as I do."

512
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,240
How so?

513
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,520
"In the dead of night, when all is still,
within the fragrant lady's quarters,

514
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,240
I am free to come and go.

515
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,480
Regardless of her status being
a princess or a noble lady,

516
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,800
a heroine or a goddess,

517
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,560
I only choose the sweetest
and most delicate spots to feast upon

518
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,000
and only stop when I am fully satisfied."

519
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,480
Hearing this, the ant and the fly
were furious.

520
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,160
"Look at you, with your sharp snout.
Such lechery."

521
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,240
How dare you?

522
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,520
Do you know who my uncle is?

523
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,360
Even if I took you as a concubine,
it'd be a miracle for your family.

524
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,920
Mess with me,
you and the Li family will be in trouble.

525
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,960
Scoundrel.

526
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,520
- Take my shovel.
- Fifth sister.

527
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,360
You.

528
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,520
Help.

529
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,240
You blind hedonist, shameless beast!

530
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,240
How dare you even dream
of taking my sister.

531
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,200
So covetous of the prosperity
for my family,

532
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,000
why don't you come over and kowtow to me?

533
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,520
If you don't shut your foul mouth
and take back your frivolous talks,

534
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,160
watch out for my shovel.
It will mash up your wolfish heart.

535
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,720
I'll pull out your filthy intestines

536
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,400
and feed you with firecrackers.

537
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,000
You'll never reincarnate after death.

538
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,880
Fifth sister, please stay calm.

539
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,320
- You…
- What?

540
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,400
Remember.

541
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,680
It is the third lady of Li
who beats you today.

542
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,960
Nothing to do with anyone else.

543
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,360
You disguised as maids in broad daylight,

544
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,800
peeking at ladies.

545
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,120
Bullied with borrowed power,
a fox masquerading as a tiger.

546
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,920
Despicable and lowly,
shameless and heartless.

547
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,120
If you don't accept this, go
to the Bureau for Letters to talk it out.

548
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,920
Even if your uncle is some dragon king
or god of the mountains,

549
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,320
the laws of Song still prevail.

550
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,000
The imperial censors in the city
will not tolerate it.

551
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,960
Certainly, they will inquire about
allowing his nephew's misconduct.

552
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,040
I want to see how you can escape that.

553
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,120
I won't dare.

554
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,560
My fault.
Sorry for the interruption, ladies.

555
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,880
Who let them in? Seize them!

556
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,640
They love to dress as women, don't they?
We have time for that.

557
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,360
- Exactly.
- Guards, take them away.

558
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,840
Mother.

559
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,400
- Very well.
- Mother.

560
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
Mother, look at her,
causing trouble again.

561
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,640
Big sister.

562
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,640
No nonsense.

563
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,080
If the host recognizes them,
they'll be guests.

564
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,680
If not, they are lascivious thieves.

565
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,120
Even if you beat them to death,
no one would hold you accountable.

566
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,880
Alright. Let's go back.

567
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,280
Return to the inn soon.

568
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,200
Cousin.

569
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,600
- Cousin.
- Speak properly.

570
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,760
What are you ranting about?
It's rather disgusting.

571
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,000
Cousin.

572
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,400
My mother-in-law and her daughters

573
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,640
have all come to Bianjing.

574
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,000
How can I survive in the future?

575
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,400
The Li families are all women.

576
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,560
Just take good care of them.
What're you talking about?

577
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,200
Cousin, you don't know.

578
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,240
Save me, Fan.

579
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,160
- Save me.
- Save me, Fan.

580
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,080
In the garden.

581
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,920
You have offended my wife?

582
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,240
My wife hit you?

583
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,480
You're going to get me killed.

584
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,000
No, we won't dare.

585
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,720
- Not your wife.
- It was a young lady with a nice voice.

586
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,360
Very fierce, quite scary.

587
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,440
There's also a scourge.

588
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,520
She hit me like this.

589
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,520
- Beating me without warning.
- Yes.

590
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,640
Her curses were terrible.

591
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,160
Extremely terrible.

592
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,600
I thought young ladies were shy

593
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,840
and wouldn't do anything
if they noticed us.

594
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,680
Who would have thought?

595
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,640
This is not surprising.

596
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,000
The Li family in Luoyang
had many hectares of good farmland.

597
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,480
Unfortunately,
my father-in-law passed away early.

598
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,680
The son died prematurely too.

599
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,080
In this house, where masculinity
ended, if the woman is weak,

600
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,320
they won't be able to protect
their family property.

601
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,240
That's right.

602
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,560
They also said

603
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,960
- the ones you associate with are evil too.
- Right.

604
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,400
Now, they'll hit once they see one.

605
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,320
- No matter if it is two or a dozen.
- Yes.

606
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,840
- Especially Mr. Chai.
- Right.

607
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,960
Still trying to provoke me with lies?

608
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,800
I don't know her.
Why hit me without reason?

609
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,600
She said you're the one instigating Fan
to reinforce the male authority.

610
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,720
On normal days,
too proud to see the dust beneath.

611
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,200
The most arrogant and rude one.
Mr. Chai, you must be careful.

612
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,560
That one who did the beating
must be the fifth lady.

613
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,120
The one who did the talking
must be the third lady.

614
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,800
The fifth lady smiles
at everyone she meets.

615
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,720
But her mother and elder sisters
can never be dishonored in front of her.

616
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,240
It's your fault for being indecent.

617
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,520
- I made a mistake.
- The third lady who fed you with vinegar.

618
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,000
She wants to get even with me.

619
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,360
Good.

620
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,840
I look forward to the challenge.

621
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,440
Cousin, you mustn't go. It's a suicide.

622
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,360
- Don't go.
- Mr. Chai.

623
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,480
- Mr. Chai.
- Stop him.

624
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,080
Quick, stop him.

625
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,600
Mother.

626
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,320
Stay a little longer.

627
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,440
I can come again next time.

628
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,480
Stay for a few more days.

629
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,480
Mother.

630
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,680
Third sister.

631
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,000
You.

632
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,800
No, sis, you can't do it.

633
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,680
Mr. Liang.

634
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,920
Mr. Liang.

635
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,440
Are you alright?

636
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,760
I can see many birds around me.

637
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,640
You're so silly. Why didn't you dodge?

638
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,360
Who is playing cuju over there?

639
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,280
Get up quickly.

640
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,520
My name is Chai An.

641
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,080
I am a friend of this house.

642
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,040
The ball slipped away.
I should be more careful.

643
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,600
I ask for Lady Li
and the other ladies' forgiveness.

644
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,320
If I broke anything,
I will pay for it at double the price.

645
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,600
- Who is the man playing cuju…
- Mother-in-law.

646
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,800
- …with third sister?
- My lady.

647
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,040
- Sisters-in-law.
- I don't know.

648
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,640
Mr. Chai's my cousin. He doesn't know
they were in the garden.

649
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,040
He showed off but people got hurt.

650
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,880
It's my fault for not explaining.

651
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,600
It was completely unintentional.

652
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,080
Blame me. It's all my fault.

653
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,760
Mother.

654
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,320
The Chai and Fan families
share a deep friendship.

655
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,360
Mr. Chai
is a frequent visitor in our home.

656
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,000
Usually, he is the most courteous one.

657
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,320
He certainly
didn't mean to offend the ladies.

658
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,960
Shall we be over with it, for me?

659
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,920
This gentleman is quite handsome.

660
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,480
He brings joy at first sight.

661
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,320
Are you…?

662
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,280
Never mind.

663
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,800
Sure, all is good.

664
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,880
Then we shall leave now.

665
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,560
Let me show you the way.

666
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,680
Let's go.

667
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,040
That was close. Dodged a bullet.

668
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,920
You deserved it. This concubine nonsense.

669
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
If you sincerely apologize,
she won't be that angry.

670
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,120
It's her.

671
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,200
Such a refreshing and stunning lady.

672
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,040
She is the one and only in Bianjing.

673
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,400
You deserved that hit from the ball.

674
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,000
Please return the hairpin comb to my lady.

675
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,240
Come try it.

676
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,360
That gentleman playing cuju
has a good demeanor.

677
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,440
He's much different from
the previous two with their sneaky looks.

678
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,240
Is he married?

679
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,720
When you approached the city,
did you see the gardens on the outskirts?

680
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,920
Yes.

681
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,120
One after another,
stretching as far as the eye can see.

682
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,360
It all belongs to his family?

683
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,800
The Chai family acquired a lot of land

684
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,440
on the outskirts of the city early on.

685
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,600
They hired skilled people
to plant vegetables widely.

686
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,800
Even during the cold winter,

687
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,680
fresh chive shoots and purslanes
are never short of supply.

688
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,200
One acre of the garden
is worth ten acres of farmland.

689
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,920
One can tell the wealth of his family
without asking.

690
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,080
It's nothing special to own land.

691
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,680
We also have good fields in Luoyang.

692
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,440
Mother, think about it.

693
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,920
Bianjing has all the princes,
dukes, ministers, and dignitaries.

694
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,960
How do they let ordinary people
have good benefits?

695
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,960
What I will be sharing today,

696
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,520
sisters, just take it as a joke.

697
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,960
Nobody should take it seriously.

698
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,200
It is said that Emperor Taizu,
during his humble beginnings,

699
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,480
received kindness
from Emperor Shizong of the Great Zhou.

700
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,120
In the end,
the Zhao family took their empire.

701
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,640
It's inevitable they feel guilt towards
Chai family descendants.

702
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,080
Rumors say that Emperor Shizong of Zhou
had seven sons.

703
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,360
Some died early.
Some had unknown whereabouts.

704
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,760
Some adopted by prominent officials
under Emperor Taizu's instruction.

705
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,520
Their surnames were changed to Pan and Lu.

706
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,280
Back to now,
after generations of his family,

707
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,600
it is hard to tell the truth.

708
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,120
I've only heard he spoke once
carelessly after drinking.

709
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,880
The family still offered incense
to the cinnabar edict.

710
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,560
- Really?
- Oh my goodness.

711
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,960
Grandma often said

712
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,720
the Fan family is considered wealthy.

713
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,920
But it is nothing
compared to their family.

714
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,880
Thanks to the Chai family's consideration
of old sentiments, they look after us.

715
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,080
Although he tends to meddle too much,

716
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,560
he is the only one sincerely
helping my husband

717
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,640
in his career and life.

718
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,840
In that case,

719
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,240
Master Chai must already
have a marriage arranged.

720
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,400
He is a man with his own ideas.

721
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,480
Ordinary women do not catch his eye.

722
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,720
I think, sooner or later,
he will marry a noble woman.

723
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,480
All that chatter.

724
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,880
If he doesn't marry my dear daughters,

725
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,560
who cares about his future bride.

726
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,280
It has nothing to do
with our family, right?

727
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,200
Had I known this,

728
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,080
I should've taught him a lesson earlier.

729
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,080
Ask him to pay the head comb.

730
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,520
Wasted good intentions.

731
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,760
Mother, I've found a good house agent

732
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,520
to rent a quiet residence
near the Fan's Mansion.

733
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,080
Shall we go and check on the house?

734
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,800
I still have important things
to take care of.

735
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,880
Third daughter, you come with me.

736
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,640
Okay.

737
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,200
Eldest daughter, Shouhua.

738
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,720
This is my third daughter, Kangning.

739
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,000
This one

740
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,400
is my fourth daughter, Haode.

741
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,440
And this

742
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,720
is my youngest fifth daughter, Leshan.

743
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,360
Alright.

744
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,160
Ms. Liu,

745
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,720
please don't forget to remind me later.

746
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,960
After offering the incense,
pack up all the portraits to take back.

747
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,520
Okay.

748
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,160
Bodhisattva, I offer you incense.

749
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,040
Bodhisattva.

750
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,600
Devout woman here, sincerely praying.

751
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,840
May my daughter's marriage be smooth.

752
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,520
The fourth and fifth daughters can wait.

753
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,840
But the eldest, Shouhua,

754
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,600
widowed at a young age,

755
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,400
wasting her youth.

756
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,000
And the third daughter, Kangning,

757
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,840
with a fierce temperament,

758
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,800
finding her a partner isn't easy.

759
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,800
They really can't wait any longer.

760
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,520
I don't ask for a son-in-law
to be very wealthy or noble.

761
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,000
But I wish my daughter

762
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,280
will find a good man

763
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,680
to support her all her life.

764
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,880
<i>I pray for the Bodhisattva's blessing</i>
<i>for mother's and sisters' health</i>

765
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,040
<i>for our family</i>
<i>to have a roof over our heads</i>

766
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,520
<i>and a place to stand our ground.</i>

767
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,120
<i>Live in peace with simple tea and meals.</i>

768
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,960
<i>These are all my wishes.</i>

769
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,840
<i>Thinking only of her own daughters,</i>

770
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,240
<i>in this world, who will pity me?</i>

771
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,840
They have suffered a lot
since they were young.

772
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,920
So, I hope for the rest of their lives,
they can find good husbands

773
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,160
and live simple and harmonious lives.

774
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,600
- Thief! Mom.
- Don't run.

775
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,120
- He took our things.
- Don't run.

776
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,840
- Thief.
- Stop the thief.

777
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,240
Catch the thief!

778
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,640
Slow down, Mother.

779
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,720
- Mother.
- Take it slow.

780
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,840
Is it because you know my daughters
can't get married?

781
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,480
- Don't move.
- I met respectable families.

782
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,720
- I'll hit you.
- Mother.

783
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,360
- Alright.
- Don't be angry with him.

784
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,760
Mother, calm down, please.

785
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,000
How can there be
such a vulgar woman in the world?

786
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,320
What kind of place is this
to tolerate her nonsense?

787
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,560
She keeps saying
she is marrying off her daughter.

788
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,080
A daughter of such a family,
who would dare to propose to her?

789
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,440
I can't stand it here.

790
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,960
It is filled with filthy noise.

791
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,480
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

792
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,600
- Take it easy.
- My daughters can't get married.

793
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,760
- It's on you.
- Mother, stop.

794
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,600
Madam, please spare me.

795
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,480
I have a docile and sensible daughter.

796
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,800
She is not married because we are poor.

797
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,280
I fear she will grow old and die at home.

798
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,040
Out of desperation, I resorted to theft.

799
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,640
I beg you, madam, to be generous.

800
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,000
Spare me this once.

801
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,520
I will never do it again.

802
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,320
- I am begging you.
- A girl from a poor family.

803
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,840
To be old and unmarried,
that is pitiful indeed.

804
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,680
Kind madam,
please have mercy and spare him.

805
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,600
Please spare him for once.

806
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,600
Please spare him.

807
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,760
Alright. I won't pursue this any further.

808
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,480
- I'll let you go.
- Merciful indeed.

809
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,360
- Let him go.
- Thank you, madam.

810
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,520
- Wait a moment.
- Good people are sure to be rewarded.

811
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,360
Here, I give this to you.

812
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,200
Consider it a good deed for myself.

813
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,160
Also, as a contribution
to your daughter's dowry.

814
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,240
Thank you, madam.

815
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,560
- No need to thank me.
- Thank you.

816
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,080
Thank you.

817
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,840
The matter is settled.

818
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,200
All is fine. Let's leave.

819
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,400
Let's go.

820
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,160
You may leave.

821
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,280
Thank you.

822
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,240
Thank you.

823
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,800
How has this practice of expensive dowries
in Bianjing evolved to this point?

824
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,440
Daughters of the poor can't get married.

825
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,640
You are not locals, right?

826
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,360
- Yes.
- You may not be aware.

827
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,360
In Bianjing,
wealth is most important in a wife.

828
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,160
The families that have daughters

829
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,200
all start saving the dowry early.

830
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,880
Hope the prep helps when
the daughter is the age for marriage.

831
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,840
You mentioned having daughters.
I wonder how many young ladies you have.

832
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,080
Five of them.

833
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,840
Four.

834
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,200
Only one has been married off.

835
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,840
Pardon my frankness,
but allow me to add this.

836
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,800
People said, "Thieves won't visit
the house with five daughters."

837
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,640
Since you have five daughters,

838
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,280
the dowries required for their marriages

839
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,240
must amount to hundreds of millions.

840
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,600
I'm afraid when the day comes,

841
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,080
even thieves will look around.

842
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,520
Hundreds of millions?

843
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,040
With only these ordinary assets,
even the bodhisattvas wouldn't notice.

844
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,240
With such stinginess, madam,

845
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,160
it'll be hard for your daughters
to get married.

846
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,400
You might as well
keep all these for yourself.

847
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,040
You scoundrel.

848
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,560
You old coffin.

849
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,520
Blind to good intentions, infuriating!

850
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,120
- Who are you talking about?
- Mother, it's alright now.

851
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,200
- Don't you have…
- Mother.

852
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,880
- Mother.
- Madam.

853
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,960
- Quick. Pinch her.
- Okay.

854
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,160
- Pinch her.
- Hit the acupoint.

855
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,160
