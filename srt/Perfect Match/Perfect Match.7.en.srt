00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,480
EPISODE 7

2
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,040
Master Du, you are quite reckless.

3
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,400
Master Liu is by no means
an ordinary wealthy merchant.

4
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,480
His businesses spread throughout
the capital of Song

5
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,120
and every state and county.

6
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,640
Even the esteemed nobility in the capital
have often received his financial support,

7
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,240
though they deal with him in private.
You have deeply offended him today.

8
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,400
He might very well
cripple your hand tomorrow.

9
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,640
How will you take the exams?

10
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,080
I know.

11
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,360
You know?

12
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,560
Knowing this, you still dared
to mock him in public?

13
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,520
Master Chai, you know what I mean.

14
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,000
If I didn't inscribe those words
on his mansion's gate

15
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,160
and let all of Bianjing know he was mad
due to his failure in grabbing a groom,

16
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,360
back then,

17
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,480
you would not have been able to rescue me,
but to collect my corpse instead.

18
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,560
A mere trifle of fleshly pain
is something I can endure.

19
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,600
You are right.

20
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,640
However, Master Du,

21
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,800
Master Liu's daughter

22
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,000
is of fine character and looks,
though not comparable

23
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,720
to the goddess of the moon,

24
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,880
and comes with the substantial dowry
of the Liu family.

25
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,880
Why not go with it
and make it a happy occasion?

26
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,600
Could it be that you already
have a wife at home?

27
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,560
No.

28
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,280
I have not yet taken a wife.

29
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,240
Nor do I have a marriage engagement.

30
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,640
But in Bianjing, when taking a wife
or marrying off a daughter,

31
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,520
people don't care first about
moral characters,

32
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,560
but for dowries and betrothal gifts.

33
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,760
This is absolutely dishonorable.

34
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,800
Won't that make all the Jinshi and Juren

35
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,040
to be beggars and parasites?

36
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,080
I deeply despise such practices.

37
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,560
As for you, Master Chai,

38
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,320
since you have a good relationship
with the Liu family,

39
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,560
why not marry their daughter?

40
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,200
In books, there are houses of gold
and ladies fair as jade.

41
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,920
Is this not what you scholars pursue?

42
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,320
If all the scholars in the world

43
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,000
study for such purpose,

44
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,960
wouldn't all the talents
selected by the state

45
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,280
become those who go after fame and profit
and see beauty over righteousness?

46
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,600
We are not the same kind.

47
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,640
We shall part ways here.

48
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,840
Master Du, wait.

49
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,200
It was merely a test for you.

50
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,720
When I make friends with someone,

51
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,160
I don't see backgrounds or talents

52
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,600
but their characters and ambition.

53
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,360
Master Du, I believe we can hit it off.

54
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,120
I spoke frankly. Please take no offense.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,080
If you don't mind my humble house,
why not move in and stay for a while?

56
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,600
You can prepare for the exams without
trivial matters of money distract you.

57
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,760
I am lodging at Xingguo Temple,

58
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,000
not just because of money.

59
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,720
There are many poor students living there.

60
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,720
It's convenient for us
to discuss literature

61
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,040
and exchange learnings there.

62
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,160
- I won't bother you further.
- Master Du.

63
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,480
This is not mere politeness.

64
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,560
I am afraid
that staying at this wealthy place

65
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,320
will reduce my resolve

66
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,240
to study hard.

67
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,360
Thank you for your kindness.

68
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,800
- I'll take my leave.
- Master Du.

69
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,600
Young Master,
this person is very stubborn.

70
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,960
He won't let the physician treat him
and insists on leaving.

71
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,440
Alright, I'll see you out.

72
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,720
Andao.

73
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,280
PAN RESTAURANT

74
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,440
Master Du,

75
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,920
if Master Liu causes trouble
for you again in the future

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,720
or if you have any needs,
you can find me at Pan Restaurant.

77
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,480
Thank you, Master Chai.

78
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,720
Take care.

79
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,320
I finally met a saint today

80
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,440
who regards money as nothing but dirt.

81
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,200
You believe in his nonsense?

82
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,240
He mentioned the old acquaintance,
only to wait for me to rescue him.

83
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,840
The country's official enrollment

84
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,000
starts from being a Jinshi at your exams.

85
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,280
Do not look down upon him
for being humble and poor now.

86
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,640
Once he does the best on the exam,

87
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,480
he'll marry the daughter of
a high-ranking official.

88
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,520
How will he care
for a mere merchant's daughter,

89
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,320
unless he is indeed foolish and sticks
to his learnings and readings?

90
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,840
A person who does not seek petty gains
must have a steadfast heart.

91
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,120
We must not underestimate them.

92
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,400
The reticent one by his side

93
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,480
doesn't seem to be ordinary either.

94
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,920
Give the order. If he visits again,
report to me immediately.

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,040
Yes.

96
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,080
- Come in.
- Please come inside.

97
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,560
- Please come inside.
- Young master,

98
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,240
Sifu House has recently set up
a literature contest.

99
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,280
They choose a topic
and everyone composes a poem.

100
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,720
The best writer
will get the fee waived for the tea.

101
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,960
and given additional gifts.

102
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,880
She is not choosing the best writer.

103
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,360
She's clearly choosing a son-in-law.

104
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,480
But their method

105
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,880
won't last more than two days.

106
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,080
Yuanming.

107
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,320
Since you had no intention of marrying,

108
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,600
you should have concealed your talents
before Liu Tang.

109
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,360
Why did you show off your talents
on purpose?

110
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,680
In this capital, eminent scholars

111
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,240
emerge in great numbers.

112
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,960
If I hadn't, how'd my reputation be known?

113
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,320
Content with poverty, devout to the path,
upholding propriety and righteousness.

114
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,600
How will they know?

115
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,920
Take care.

116
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,160
Come take a look.

117
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,960
Lady, have a look.

118
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,320
CAKES

119
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,320
It smells good.

120
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,240
Sir, are you buying some cakes?

121
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,200
They are all freshly baked and still warm.

122
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,120
Look here.

123
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,120
- I'll have one.
- Okay.

124
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,920
Here is the money.

125
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,360
- Here you go.
- Okay.

126
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,600
Andao,

127
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,880
I know you hate

128
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,360
those who seek fame.

129
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,680
But I must tell you.

130
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,480
To be a good official,

131
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,640
aside from caring
for the country and the people

132
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,400
and being diligent and incorruptible,

133
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,640
you also need
to be flexible and quick-witted.

134
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,280
You must not stick to the rules rigidly.

135
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,160
Also,

136
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,200
how is your injury?

137
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,440
You couldn't fight,

138
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,440
and you didn't dodge.

139
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,960
You are truly an honest one.

140
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,920
Mind your own business first.

141
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,600
Wait.

142
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,520
Andao.

143
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,440
Are you here for the literary matchmaking?

144
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,760
- Please come inside.
- What's this?

145
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,840
Right here.

146
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,520
The literary matchmaking event is on.

147
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,080
Please come in.

148
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,040
Please.

149
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,400
SIFU HOUSE

150
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,720
A cup of Qibao pounded tea

151
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,400
and a plate of Sanzi are coming.

152
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,200
- Okay, thank you.
- Enjoy your meal.

153
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,920
Li, you used this "gaze" word well.

154
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,080
Zhang and Wang,

155
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,480
look at this article.

156
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,920
It's really good, isn't it?

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,280
- Another bowl of salted soybean soup.
- Alright. Right away.

158
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,720
- That's absolutely amazing.
- The brilliance is in this very stroke.

159
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,880
Look at this.

160
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,600
This is written so well.

161
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,840
What a superb verse!

162
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,800
And this one.

163
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,920
It's really well-written.

164
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,880
Young master,

165
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,080
could you take a look?

166
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,280
What does this sentence mean?

167
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,520
You've read this sentence wrong.

168
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,200
This is an acrostic poem.

169
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,720
We need to read it horizontally,

170
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,240
starting from this side.

171
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,520
I see.

172
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,520
Thank you, young master.

173
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,440
To describe wind…

174
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,000
How about using this character?

175
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,440
Well written indeed!

176
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,880
This brushwork is bold and powerful.

177
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,520
Everyone, Pan Restaurant
is organizing a poetry contest.

178
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,760
Great scholars
from the Imperial College will be judges.

179
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,600
It's published
a list of top scholar candidates.

180
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,600
The list of top scholar candidates?

181
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,360
Don't go! You guys?

182
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,800
Wait. Don't leave.

183
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,880
They've all left…

184
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,600
You haven't paid yet.

185
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,560
Is there really not one

186
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,040
that catches the eye?

187
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,840
They all look good to me.

188
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,320
A faint fragrance drifts,
seeming there and yet not.

189
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,440
It's the incense most suitable
for literati and scholars.

190
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,920
Big sis, the incense you've blended
can sell for a high price.

191
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,240
We're worried about you
yet you talk about other things.

192
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,960
If Shouhua says they're not good,
it must be the truth.

193
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,680
I'd rather skip.

194
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,800
But it has already been three days.

195
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,600
The tea house is full every day.

196
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,480
Not one qualified?

197
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,400
There are quite a few poems here

198
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,280
that you haven't read yet, sis.

199
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,720
Today, I looked with Kangning
through the curtain.

200
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,720
None are good-looking.

201
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,520
Good-looking?

202
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,480
Do you care for poetic talent

203
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,720
or appearance?

204
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,320
Poetic talent is indeed important,

205
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,600
but appearance matters more.

206
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,600
The imperial examinations

207
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,120
select scholars with talent.

208
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,720
How can you judge them by appearances?

209
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,880
There'll be provincial examinations
next year,

210
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,680
and the palace examination in March.

211
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,160
The top ten papers
in the palace examination

212
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,320
will all be ranked before His Majesty.

213
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,480
According to tradition,

214
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,240
His Majesty will personally meet
with the top three

215
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
to determine the final rankings.

216
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,480
Other than the written works,
what else does His Majesty consider?

217
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,680
- Composure?
- These are unwritten conventions.

218
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,920
Not to mention the top three.

219
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,200
Aren't the most acclaimed scholars
this year

220
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,040
all Juren who are dignified in appearance
and extraordinarily elegant?

221
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,720
Besides, we're choosing
a husband for Kangning.

222
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,080
An ugly man

223
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,800
is unacceptable.

224
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,080
Shouhua.

225
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,600
I'm furious.

226
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,320
Who upset you again?

227
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,800
Of course, Pan Restaurant.

228
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,680
They've started some kind
of top-scholar gambling pool.

229
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,880
They've also invited

230
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,240
some pedantic scholars to judge the poems.
They've drawn everyone over there.

231
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,680
Stop that.

232
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,240
I think they are deliberately
causing us trouble.

233
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,640
Choosing a husband is a minor issue.

234
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,800
Business is the priority.

235
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,120
I wanted to take this good opportunity

236
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,800
to gain some reputation for Sifu House.

237
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,160
Now, it seems we must find another way.

238
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,520
Kangning.

239
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,800
Come in.

240
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,200
Shouhua.

241
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,720
You're still awake at this late hour?

242
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,320
I remembered Father used to teach me
to paint plum blossoms.

243
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,360
So, I felt inspired
and picked up the brush again.

244
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
What do you need me for?

245
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,560
I have something

246
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,000
to add to your dowry.

247
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,960
- Shao, quickly.
- Li.

248
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,320
Sorry for being late.

249
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,120
When did the literary matchmaking start?

250
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,040
Li.

251
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,000
- Pleased to meet you.
- Let's go.

252
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,760
Let's go have a look.

253
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,520
SIFU HOUSE

254
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,680
What happened?

255
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,680
Young master,

256
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,520
Sifu House has put on a big display,
a literary contest to find a son-in-law.

257
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,040
It's caused a sensation in the city.

258
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,160
Everyone is rushing there
to watch the event.

259
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,480
Zhao.

260
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,320
Madam Li, even when a prominent family
holds a matchmaking session,

261
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,280
they must present their daughter

262
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,680
for the candidates to have a look.

263
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,960
Yes. Exactly.

264
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,760
You promised the literary matchmaking
personally,

265
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,240
but you're hiding your daughter away.

266
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,520
Could it be
that she is not outstanding at all,

267
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,240
so that you plan this on purpose?

268
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,200
- Right.
- Exactly.

269
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,520
He is right.

270
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,920
Please pardon my audacity.

271
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,480
A daughter is born to resemble her mother.

272
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,960
If your daughter resembles you a lot…

273
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,520
Alright.

274
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,320
I think all of us should head over

275
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,680
to Pan Restaurant across the street
to evaluate poetry.

276
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,680
- Right?
- That's right.

277
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,400
Madam Li, did you summon us

278
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,880
all here just to idly grind ink?

279
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,560
Exactly.

280
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,240
How tasteless you are!

281
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,280
Who hasn't gone through
their youthful days?

282
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,440
Back in my youth,

283
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,320
those who came to propose marriage

284
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,120
wore out eight door thresholds
of my house.

285
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,120
All of you, on the other hand,

286
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,320
don't provoke me any further.

287
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
This is a literary matchmaking.

288
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,680
Rules must be obeyed.

289
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,440
What kind of rules?

290
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,080
Come out.

291
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,840
There's also a prize?

292
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,800
What is this?

293
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,520
It's okay if your daughter is a bit ugly.

294
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,440
Be generous.

295
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,520
These two can be the maids
accompanying the bride.

296
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,400
It's an insult to scholarly grace.

297
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,560
Lu, please don't be annoyed.

298
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,960
No one here

299
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,240
really wants to marry
the daughter of a tea house owner.

300
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,800
For what? Her ability to make tea?

301
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,000
We're all just here for a bit of fun.

302
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,800
- That's right.
- Right.

303
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,640
Well…

304
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,360
- Is this…?
- This is a pearl curtain.

305
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,760
This is worth a fortune.

306
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,440
This is indeed worth a fortune.

307
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,920
I can't accept this.

308
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,320
It's the keepsake your ex-husband
left for you. Take it back.

309
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,680
This pearl curtain

310
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,080
was left to me by my husband.

311
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,920
He wholeheartedly hoped

312
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,440
that I could live well in the future.

313
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,760
But for me to live well,
the Li family must be doing well.

314
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,160
This pearl curtain
is not for you in particular, Kangning.

315
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,120
It is a gift to someone

316
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,320
who can shield the Li family
from the wind and rain

317
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,560
in the not-too-distant future.

318
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,880
Kangning,

319
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,080
you must remember

320
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,560
all the words I say tonight.

321
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,200
Tomorrow, you must open your eyes wide

322
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,240
and choose carefully.

323
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,080
We've made a big scene,

324
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,360
not just for your marriage.

325
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,880
Although my family
is not a large household,

326
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,080
all my daughters
have all been carefully raised

327
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,680
and treated like pearls.

328
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,640
In the future, no matter
which family my third daughter

329
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,480
marries into, this pearl curtain

330
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,760
will accompany her to the new family.

331
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,800
- This is worth it.
- Good indeed.

332
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,280
But let it be said upfront.

333
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,360
My daughter
is a hundred times more precious

334
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,720
than this pearl curtain.

335
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,800
This is just a prize of good luck.

336
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,560
If someone wins her over,

337
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,640
it would be a blessing
for his whole family

338
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,560
and a fortune that's been prayed for
by nine generations of ancestors.

339
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,080
Make way. Make way.

340
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,240
Exactly how ugly

341
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,160
is your daughter

342
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,560
that you're willing to part

343
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,120
with such a treasure, Madam Li?

344
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,320
How ugly is she exactly?

345
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,040
She is so beautiful.

346
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,000
- Indeed.
- Right.

347
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,200
- She could be considered stunning.
- She's so beautiful.

348
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,160
She is really gorgeous.

349
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,720
She is so charming.

350
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,200
Look.

351
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,560
We will have a poetry topic.

352
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,560
Gentlemen,

353
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,640
take a good look.

354
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,960
- Flower. Gentlemen, please look.
- Flower?

355
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,200
The poetry topic is "flower".

356
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,800
Flower?

357
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,760
Flower?

358
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,520
Young master, you were first arrogant
and now respectful.

359
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,840
Your attitude
has changed too quickly, hasn't it?

360
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,560
- Exactly.
- It has changed too fast.

361
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,560
Exactly.

362
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,880
That's right.

363
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,360
He is a man with two faces.

364
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,240
Young lady, don't go.

365
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,200
- Why are you leaving?
- Don't go.

366
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,640
SIFU HOUSE

367
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,760
- Young master.
- Go.

368
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,440
Summon someone for me.

369
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,720
- Who?
- Du Yangxi.

370
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,840
Madam Li, is it true that whoever
wins the poetry contest

371
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,400
can marry your daughter?

372
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,320
Mother-in-law.

373
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,520
- Piss off.
- A person's word is their bond.

374
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,920
If I were to seriously

375
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,240
start composing poetry,

376
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,680
you must not go back on your word.

377
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,720
Who is your mother-in-law?
My poetry skills are better than yours.

378
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,560
In terms of talent,

379
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,400
who can surpass me?

380
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,360
Goose, goose, goose.

381
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,000
Its neck bends as it sings to the sky.

382
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,160
What is this for?

383
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,640
This is…

384
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,240
Inside this house, there is no boundary
between men and women.

385
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,200
My daughter willing to show her face

386
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,640
is already an exception.

387
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,840
What I'm baking today

388
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,600
is top-scholar's pastry.

389
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,720
Top-scholar's pastry?

390
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,000
This is good.

391
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,920
Once the pastry is well baked,

392
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,840
all your poems

393
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,280
must be ready as well.

394
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,040
I see.

395
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,040
What are you waiting for?

396
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,040
Hurry. Get writing.

397
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,240
- Dear me!
- Get me two pieces of pastry.

398
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,600
There are plenty out there
who wish to be my son-in-law.

399
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,320
Make way for me quickly.

400
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,440
Have a pot of tea.

401
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,520
Flower.

402
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,000
Alright.

403
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,000
Only these two have the best poems.

404
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,200
That plum-blossom poem is rather ordinary.

405
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,000
But this one…

406
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,800
Whether read from left or right,
it doesn't make a poem either way.

407
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,720
<i>Returning from flower viewing</i>
<i>The horse flies like the wind</i>

408
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,040
<i>The horse flies like the wind</i>
<i>I was drunk with little wine</i>

409
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,320
<i>With the wine, I awake at dusk</i>

410
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,280
<i>It's dusk when I awake</i>
<i>Returning from the flower viewing</i>

411
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,720
This is a palindromic poem.

412
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,280
It seems to have only one "flower",

413
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,360
yet two lines
both conceal the word "flower".

414
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,520
Clever indeed.

415
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,000
But between the two of them,

416
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,440
who truly is today's champion?

417
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,760
Both are.

418
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,680
And neither are.

419
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,120
Poetry creation requires inspiration.

420
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,760
When everyone sits in the tea house,

421
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,680
writing for the poetry challenge,

422
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,360
how could they write their best?

423
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,920
Knowing they couldn't do well,
why would you set such a challenge?

424
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,000
The poetry topic is ordinary.

425
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,120
Who knows whether they've
taken someone else's poem

426
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,600
to fool us?

427
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,680
This excellent handwriting

428
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,880
is very rare.

429
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,720
I don't know much about writing.

430
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,960
How does it compare
to your writing, Shouhua?

431
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,040
It surpasses mine by far.

432
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,360
The calligraphy takes

433
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,120
at least ten years of diligent practice

434
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,360
throughout seasons.

435
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,480
It's no easy work.

436
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,000
With such perseverance and talent,

437
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,680
the person is well-educated
without asking.

438
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,040
However, I still have to test him again.

439
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,160
Limited to the baking time
in the inner room

440
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,200
and surrounded by spectators
in the outer room,

441
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,880
this round tested

442
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,640
their quick wit and composure.

443
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,360
Finding more about them is not difficult.

444
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,040
Don't we have a second round?

445
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,120
Kangning, go and try them,
and then you will know.

446
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,760
It's hard to judge the superior
poetry of you two at the moment.

447
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,680
I have a couplet here.

448
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,080
May I ask you to attempt a match?

449
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,960
Please go ahead, young lady.

450
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,840
Here is the first line of the couplet.

451
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,120
Li Boyang has "Li" as the surname,

452
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,720
born with knowledge.

453
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,120
Li Boyang?

454
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,040
It refers

455
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,400
to Laozi, who was born with knowledge
of all things.

456
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,560
The difficulty of this first line
lies in the fact

457
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,520
that the first sentence
has two "Li" characters.

458
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,840
Not just that.

459
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,320
The "birth" character below

460
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,840
also aligns with the right arm
of the "surname" character above.

461
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,360
This is a character-dissection game.

462
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,840
Young lady, are you deliberately
making things difficult?

463
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,160
Who can match this couplet on the spot?

464
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,400
- Yes, indeed.
- It's too difficult.

465
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,520
Then you better listen well.

466
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,800
My match is "Ma Wenyuan had his body
wrapped in horsehide,

467
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,360
dead without giving up."

468
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,160
"Ma Yuan" corresponds to "Li Boyang".

469
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,000
"Dead without giving up" corresponds
to "born with knowledge".

470
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,920
Very good.

471
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,360
- Good.
- And the "death" character

472
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,320
corresponds to the "corpse" character.

473
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,120
Incredibly clever.

474
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,120
Clever.

475
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,440
Splendid.

476
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,120
Young master, may I have your name?

477
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,400
How old are you, and where is your home?

478
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,600
I have a daughter

479
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,600
who is good

480
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,320
in both appearance and character.

481
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,720
I am willing to betroth her to you.

482
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,640
Congratulations, young master.

483
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,080
I'm afraid there's a grand success

484
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,400
to come after the wedding.

485
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,480
Congratulations.

486
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,920
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

487
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,880
I'm Jia Ming, from Hongzhou.

488
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,720
Thank you for your kind suggestion, Madam.

489
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,040
But are you sure you will betroth
your daughter to me?

490
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,880
I set up this literary challenge
in public.

491
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,240
Everyone here can be a witness.

492
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,200
How can it be false?

493
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,920
This cannot be rushed.

494
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,400
I need to finish my exams
and return home first

495
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,320
and then discuss it with my wife.

496
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,040
Your wife?

497
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,200
So, he has a wife.

498
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,160
Madam Li,

499
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,040
you wouldn't betroth your beautiful
daughter to him as a concubine, would you?

500
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,560
All the fuss is for nothing.

501
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,320
You might as well
marry your daughter to me.

502
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,760
Wait.

503
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,880
You…

504
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,240
If you are already married,

505
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,720
why didn't you say so earlier?

506
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,720
Madam,

507
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,480
I was just passing by

508
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,280
and saw that it was very lively here.

509
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,600
I thought there was a poetry contest
or literary contest going on

510
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,080
to make friends through literature.

511
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,840
Who would have thought your family
was so eager to find a son-in-law

512
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,600
before the Ministry of Rites
started the exams?

513
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,720
Are you fooling me?

514
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
Huh?

515
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,680
Mother, wait.

516
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,160
My third daughter, he is making
a fool of us in public.

517
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,280
Young master, since you
already have a wife at home,

518
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,120
I naturally cannot marry you.

519
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,480
There's no need to mention
the pearl curtain again.

520
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,080
However, you are still the champion
of the day.

521
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,800
So, you can take another prize.

522
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,000
- There is another prize?
- What will it be?

523
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,840
- Another prize?
- There is another prize.

524
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:26,040
Besides the pearl curtain and you,
there is another prize?

525
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,160
Bright eyes, long ears, big mouth,

526
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,800
and the feet are even more nimble.

527
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,920
Not even knowing what place this is,
and they just barged in straightforwardly.

528
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,960
Today's prize actually matches you.

529
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,160
She said I had sharp eyes,

530
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,600
long ears, and a big mouth,

531
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,760
and I just rushed there happily,
wherever there is excitement.

532
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,240
At first, I was puzzled.

533
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,040
But after thinking it over carefully,
she was talking about a donkey.

534
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,320
Master Chai, you may not know.

535
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,640
But now, the Li family's
literary matchmaking

536
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,560
has become the latest joke
in all of Bianjing.

537
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,680
Do you know what people call me
behind my back?

538
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,920
Top-scholar Donkey.

539
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,000
Luckily that day, I disguised myself.

540
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,160
Otherwise, my reputation

541
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,320
would have been completely ruined
by the Third Lady.

542
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:22,960
What a pity.

543
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,040
What?

544
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,480
Li Boyang has "Li" as the surname,
born with knowledge.

545
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,800
She is able to come up with this couplet.

546
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,480
This young lady must have talent
that is not beneath mine.

547
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,480
It's a pity that I arrived late
and didn't get to witness her beauty.

548
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,760
But to make many scholars bow down,

549
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,520
she must be a beauty with talent.

550
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,520
I don't agree.

551
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,600
Chai,

552
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,200
what deep grudge do you actually have
against the Third Lady?

553
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,240
Why did you intend to ruin her marriage?

554
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,360
There's no grudge or resentment.
It's just we've crossed paths in business.

555
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,720
The small Sifu House took away
the business of the entire street.

556
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,320
Can't I pay back in a little?

557
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,720
Then you are too harsh.

558
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,640
You didn't see

559
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,880
that Madam Li's face
almost turned green with anger.

560
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,240
Angry enough to tear me in half.

561
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,320
Do you really think
that Li Kangning would be at a loss?

562
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,360
She has already made a fortune.

563
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,120
It's like a dream.

564
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,560
Hurry and put away
my precious pearl curtain.

565
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,680
Next year, Haode can still use it.

566
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,000
And the year after,
Leshan can still use it.

567
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,680
These two households are originally one.
They are separated by only a wall.

568
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,720
It was originally going
to be rented out to others.

569
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,400
I've specially kept it for you.

570
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,200
I told you this shop
would bring you luck, right?

571
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,320
As I expected, it hasn't been long.

572
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,840
Business is booming.

573
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,480
You've renewed the lease of the shop
for another two years.

574
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,520
Now you've rented this courtyard as well.

575
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,640
Your future blessings

576
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,200
will be endless and inexhaustible.

577
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,160
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

578
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,040
The wall between
the two households is too low.

579
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,520
If you rent it to someone else,

580
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,720
they'll take the opportunity
to spy on my backyard.

581
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,640
Right?

582
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,560
You are right.

583
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,520
Then,

584
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,960
I've handed over the keys to you.

585
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,560
- Make sure to keep them safe.
- Alright.

586
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,760
You must call her "good lady"
to get some porridge.

587
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,000
Good lady.

588
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,600
This girl is quite a beauty.

589
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,920
- Enough.
- Madam.

590
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Alright. Now that I have the keys,

591
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,200
let's cut the formalities.

592
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,440
I will go to you if there is anything.
You can leave now.

593
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,880
- Be sure to come to me.
- Take care.

594
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,160
- Come to me.
- I won't see you off.

595
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,440
Come to me.

596
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,040
Here. Take this.

597
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,640
These peddlers who roam the streets

598
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,320
are really cunning and treacherous.

599
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,880
They find loopholes
to sneak into peoples' private quarters.

600
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,400
Your younger sisters are still young.

601
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,880
In the future, when I'm not home,

602
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,200
don't open the door for them.

603
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,160
I know.

604
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,480
Mother,
ever since the literary matchmaking,

605
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,920
there are quite a few people
hanging outside our door all day.

606
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,720
I've seen them several times
when I went out.

607
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,200
- It's so terrifying.
- Absolutely.

608
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,240
Our household is all women.

609
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,240
It's inevitable we attract
the attention of scoundrels.

610
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,440
Fortunately, we exchange frequent visits
with the Fan's.

611
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,800
Otherwise, our life would be

612
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,520
- far from peaceful.
- Here.

613
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,800
I should marry you two off
sooner rather than later.

614
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,480
That would settle one of my worries.

615
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,000
Madam Li, rest assured.

616
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,080
We're here to guard the gate for you.

617
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,640
Thank you.

618
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,960
This porridge is all ready.
Take it back and share it with them.

619
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,280
Okay. Thank you, young lady.

620
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,440
Go ahead. Don't spill it.

621
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,520
Remember to return the bowl.

622
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,480
Okay.

623
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,520
I've got it.

624
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,680
Where's Shouhua?

625
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,280
Leshan has caught a chill.
Haode is taking care of her inside.

626
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,320
Shouhua said she thought

627
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,960
of her ex-husband's prescription.
She's gone to get the medicine.

628
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,040
She's back.

629
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,840
Shouhua.

630
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,880
You…

631
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,160
- What happened to you?
- He was frozen stiff on the way.

632
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,560
I was passing by.

633
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,880
He is frozen.

634
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,040
Poor young man.

635
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,800
- Can he make it through?
- Qiongnu, hurry up.

636
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,760
- The water is here.
- He is frozen.

637
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,160
He's freezing to death. Hurry.

638
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,120
- Get him bowl of ginger soup.
- Okay.

639
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,560
This poor thing.

640
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,280
Wait.

641
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,160
It's him.

642
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,320
Don't save him. Stop.

643
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,240
Don't lie down here.

644
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,960
- Get off the bed.
- Mother, he's not up yet.

645
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,080
- What are you doing?
- Wait. Kangning,

646
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,040
don't you remember him?

647
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,640
He's that man from the other day…

648
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
He's the one from the day
of the literary matchmaking.

649
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,320
It's him.

650
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,680
- Right? You recognize him now.
- It's actually him.

651
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,280
A heartless villain like him deserves
to freeze to death.

652
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,640
Let's beat him to death.

653
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,960
- We won't save you.
- Mother.

654
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,920
- Stop.
- Mother.

655
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,680
Don't. It'd be okay
if we let him freeze to death earlier,

656
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,160
but if you throw him out now,
those who don't know the whole story

657
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,880
might actually condemn us as heartless
and impious.

658
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,720
Mother, I'm the one being teased.
I'm not even holding a grudge.

659
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,760
Isn't saving a life
better than offering food

660
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,240
- and donating money?
- Xing…

661
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,160
Xingguo Temple…

662
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,320
There is someone there.

663
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,160
Who's there?

664
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,520
There is someone there.

665
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,160
He keeps mentioning Xingguo Temple.
Who could be there?

666
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,720
Maybe he is a Juren
coming here from the imperial exams

667
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,360
and he is worried about his luggage.

668
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,720
In my opinion,

669
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,960
we can send an errand boy
to Xingguo Temple

670
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,120
to find out his details

671
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,800
and take care of his belongings,

672
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,280
especially the poems
and essays he writes regularly,

673
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,720
- to make sure they're not lost.
- You're not allowed to go.

674
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,760
You two are too kind.

675
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,680
Since we know where he's from,
we should send him back to Xingguo Temple.

676
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,240
I won't feed this wolf-hearted scoundrel.

677
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,920
He's being forced
to stay at Xingguo Temple.

678
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,640
Who's there to take care of him?

679
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,240
If you send him off
and he dies on the way…

680
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,360
Mother, he is a Juren after all.

681
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,840
Juren, right?

682
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,120
We have to save him.

683
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,760
But we should still find out
if he's married.

684
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,320
We won't save him if he's married.

685
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,800
- We won't save him then.
- Okay.

686
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,240
You deserve to freeze to death.

687
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,200
What did you say?

688
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,240
I was ordered to bring Mr. Du charcoal
and cotton-padded clothes for winter.

689
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,760
But the temple keeper said
he moved away.

690
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,000
Moved to where?

691
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,160
It's said that Mr. Du's close friend
had a fever.

692
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,440
He ran around seeking medicine for him.

693
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,120
Unfortunately, he fell ill by the roadside
and saved by the Li family.

694
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,160
The Li family also took his luggage away

695
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,720
along with his sick friend.

696
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,400
Well,
why is it the Li family of all people?

697
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,120
I have already checked.
Leshan has taken the medicine and sweat.

698
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,600
She is now sleeping soundly.

699
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,080
Keep the medicine dregs

700
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,440
and send them to that man

701
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,840
so as to avoid seeking physicians.

702
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,560
Otherwise, given Mother's frugality,
she wants to drive those two away.

703
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,760
I see.

704
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,320
Chunlai, you may continue.

705
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
Those two people

706
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,480
were cramped in a room

707
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,360
as small as a chicken coop.

708
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,160
Other than a worn ink stone,

709
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,280
a few broken brushes,

710
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,800
and several volumes of old books,

711
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,560
what's left was an oil lamp
that you wouldn't get a drop of oil out of

712
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,000
even if you rub it for three days.

713
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,960
The temple keeper says
if there is a day when they

714
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,200
don't set up to sell writings,

715
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,160
they probably won't even
fill their stomachs.

716
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,200
In this world,
there are actually such poor Jurens.

717
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,440
It's really quite astonishing.

718
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,160
Then he was lying

719
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,440
when he said he had a wife.

720
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,160
Being so poor,
how could he support a wife?

721
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,080
To raise money for traveling
to the capital for the exams,

722
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,200
it's common for people
to sell land and borrow money.

723
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,040
Moreover, I find
in their collection of books

724
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,840
quite a few rare hand-copied editions,
seldom seen on the streets.

725
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,400
It appears

726
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,680
that whenever these two people
have a bit of money,

727
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,760
they spend it at the book market
of Xiangguo Temple.

728
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,800
Shouhua, are you saying
that they are a master and his servant?

729
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,040
No.

730
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,040
The temple keeper says
these two are quite strange.

731
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,200
They frequently exchange their clothes.

732
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,600
And they take turns
attending their writing stall.

733
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,960
I see.

734
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,360
Although they're poor Jurens
coming to the capital for the exams,

735
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,920
they inevitably need to visit friends.

736
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Without a servant by their side,
they couldn't enter people's gatehouses.

737
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,480
Pretending to be each other's servant
is a good way for them to save face.

738
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,920
Shouhua, your finding was quite something.

739
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,400
You've actually found two Jurens.

740
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,440
These two pedantic scholars
are really interesting.

741
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,680
Very peculiar indeed.

742
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,000
- Two scholars.
- Mother.

743
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,200
- Leshan is much better now.
- Two.

744
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,520
Mother?

745
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,000
Two scholars.

746
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,400
Has Mother heard it?

747
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,000
Heard what exactly?

748
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,680
She looks so happy.

749
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,600
Yuanming,

750
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,680
if Cousin Fan hadn't mentioned it,
I wouldn't have known that you moved here.

751
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,960
How can you live in such a humble place?

752
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,280
Deqing.

753
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,040
Hurry and pack Mr. Du's luggage.
Take him to my house to recuperate.

754
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,960
- Master Chai…
- Yuanming,

755
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,960
this time, you must listen to me.

756
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,160
Do it.

757
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,000
- Mother-in-law.
- Madam Li.

758
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,840
What's wrong with my place?

759
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,440
He can't live here?

760
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,560
My entire family lives here,

761
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,920
and we are just fine.

762
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,680
Madam Li, you've misunderstood.

763
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,920
I absolutely didn't mean that.

764
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,480
Mother-in-law,

765
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,240
my cousin didn't mean that.

766
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,200
He means this courtyard
was originally used for storage.

767
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,080
And it will be quite inconvenient
for Master Du

768
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,840
- if he wants to study for the exam.
- What's inconvenient about it?

769
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,000
He lived in Xingguo Temple's wing room.

770
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,040
Now he can't live here?

771
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,560
Is the roof missing a tile

772
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,320
or the floor missing a brick?

773
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,280
Or does the Chai's mansion
have one more wall than others?

774
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,600
Madam Li,

775
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,280
I sincerely meant well.

776
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,960
The Li household is all women.

777
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,280
It would be quite inconvenient
for young men to live here for long.

778
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,760
The two courtyards
are separated by a wall,

779
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,240
and they each have their own gate.

780
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,960
They are simply unrelated.

781
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,200
As for me, I had already planned

782
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,960
to rent out the east and west wings

783
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,280
and use the main room as a storeroom.

784
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,120
But our household is all women.

785
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,120
It's not proper to rent
to complicated tenants.

786
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,200
As for you two,
you are both decent scholars.

787
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,520
If you live at my place,

788
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,520
you can study with peace of mind

789
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,840
and help me guard my home.

790
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,840
Sifu House
is frequented by many literary guests.

791
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,360
So, there will be no shortage of repartee.

792
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,480
I will reduce the rent

793
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,480
and provide meals every day.

794
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,880
And you can help with writing
on the counter.

795
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,960
Isn't it convenient for both sides?

796
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,080
But Madam Li, if Yuanming stays--

797
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,480
But the physician also said

798
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,360
the situation of your friend
in the other room

799
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,520
is greatly undermined.

800
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,720
He's like a tree with its roots damaged.

801
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,320
If moved, that could mean death to him.

802
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,400
Young Master Du,

803
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,720
you have to decide for yourself.

804
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,160
Yuanming, say something.

805
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,280
Chai, well,
Madam Li is full of good intentions

806
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,640
and considerate in every aspect.

807
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,520
To decline her would actually be rude.

808
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,000
So, I have no choice
but to accept her kindness

809
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,600
and repay her in the future.

810
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,840
You called me out early in the morning

811
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,640
to accompany you
to see these two scholars.

812
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,280
If you didn't come,
would the Li family let me in?

813
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,920
Cousin, what in the world do you want?

814
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,240
What are you doing?

815
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,040
I want to know what's wrong with this wall
that it's worth staring at it for so long.

816
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,280
This wall

817
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,800
is too high.

818
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,600
Too high?

819
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,720
Mother.

820
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,240
Shouhua. Kangning.

821
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,160
Come quickly.

822
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,520
- Come quickly.
- What's the rush?

823
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,520
W-What are you doing?

824
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,720
What's this for?

825
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,400
You… This…

826
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,800
You…

827
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,400
Who are you people?

828
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,760
How can you start redoing the wall
without talking to the owner?

829
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,240
Who are they?

830
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,400
Madam Li, do not be upset.

831
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,160
My master has ordered us to clean up
and reorganize this place

832
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,360
so that Master Du
can live more comfortably.

833
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,720
I'll tell them to be gentler

834
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,800
and not to disturb you.

835
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,640
- Then, what's the deal with this wall?
- The household over the wall is all women.

836
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,920
A gentleman prevents trouble
and avoids sketchy places.

837
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,600
I've ordered them
to raise this low wall by a few feet

838
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,920
to remove any ground for gossip.

839
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,800
And Master Du agreed to this.

840
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,920
- What do you say?
- I say…

841
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,720
You…

842
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,640
Yuanming, you are still ill.

843
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,200
You need someone to take care of you.

844
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,720
I will leave these two people here

845
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,000
to prepare medicine, serve tea,

846
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,560
and make the bed for you.

847
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,400
You can't always trouble the Li family.

848
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,920
After all, they are all women.

849
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,320
Chai,

850
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,080
you may not know

851
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,480
Andao, the guy who lives next door,
how stubborn he can be.

852
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,360
If a woman were to serve him closely,

853
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,880
I'm afraid he'd want to throw
himself into a lake when he wakes.

854
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,800
As for me, when studying,

855
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,640
I fear nothing more
than the clamor of people.

856
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,440
I can't simply ask them to not say a word.
So, there is no need to let them stay.

857
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,320
I knew you would be unaccustomed.

858
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,960
- Lingyao.
- Yes.

859
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,000
Starting from today,

860
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,720
you will stay here to serve Yuanming.

861
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,680
Understood.

862
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,960
Well…

863
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,200
You shouldn't reject a mere page boy.

864
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,640
If you say another word of refusal,
I will truly become angry.

865
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,920
Alright.

866
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,560
I'll accept him.

867
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,240
I heard that Master Sang

868
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,280
still hasn't recovered
after taking medicine.

869
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,680
Perhaps the physician here
isn't very effective.

870
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,840
To avoid any mishaps,
I have specially invited

871
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,200
Physician Liu of Yutang Alley

872
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,720
whose expertise is treating colds.

873
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,680
He's guaranteed to cure
as soon as he treats.

874
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,200
Be careful.

875
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,600
Be careful. Slowly. I've got you.

876
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,840
Not only did they raise the wall,

877
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,960
they also assigned a servant
to watch the gate.

878
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,480
They treat us as if we were thieves.

879
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,240
The guest takes over to be the owner.

880
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,640
The visitor turns into the host.

881
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,920
What do they want?

882
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,600
Shouhua, what are you laughing at?

883
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,040
Today, I finally understand

884
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,400
what "evil always prevails

885
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,360
over justice" means.

886
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,080
Kangning,

887
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,280
we've managed to keep them here.
But it's still hard to have our way.

888
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,520
Then, let's wait and see

889
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,440
who plays the evil in the end.

890
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,080
Young master,

891
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,640
the courtyard is all cleaned up.

892
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,360
Do you have any further instructions?

893
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,160
Too short.

894
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,640
Short?

895
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,960
Where is the flute sound coming from?

896
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,480
A crow has nested here,

897
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,200
clamoring day and night

898
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,120
and startling the patients,
so they can't rest.

899
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,520
How can they recuperate with this?

900
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,880
Do you even know how to handle things?

901
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,680
Young master, I told them
to saw down this tree early on.

902
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,600
But I was afraid the sound of cutting wood
would disturb the peace.

903
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,480
The elders often say

904
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,480
that when crows nest somewhere,

905
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,160
there must be misfortune.

906
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,120
I don't care about these superstitions.

907
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,120
But they are facing
important examinations.

908
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,600
So, it feels somewhat unlucky.

909
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,240
Besides that, sawing a tree down
will only take half a day.

910
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,640
If they can't endure the sawing,
it'll be crows another two months.

911
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,880
You can't do the math?
You know it's because you're lazy.

912
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,760
You're right. It's all my fault.

913
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,200
Young master, you do have the resolve.
Without the crow's noise in the future,

914
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,840
they can concentrate on their studies.

915
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,760
<i>No.</i>

916
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,160
<i>He's waiting for me to argue with him.</i>

917
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,720
<i>Don't fall for his trick.</i>

918
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,200
Kangning.

919
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,280
Kangning.

920
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,880
Put in a little more effort.
You get two more dishes at Pan Restaurant.

921
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,240
Alright.

922
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,600
The crow causes a ruckus every night,

923
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,760
making Master Sang
toss and turn all last night.

924
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,840
It's really annoying.

925
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,080
Sawing the tree down is a good thing.

926
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,280
Lingyao,

927
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,200
your master

928
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,120
is truly an interesting person.

929
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,960
No. I must intervene. If I don't,

930
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,680
they will tear down my courtyard.

931
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,040
Mother,

932
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,440
didn't you previously dislike that crow

933
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,480
because it was noisy?

934
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,960
You also complained the tree
sheds leaves all over the ground,

935
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,080
which can't be swept away.

936
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,520
You said someone would saw it down.

937
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,120
Well, they were interrupting
Kangning's performance.

938
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,760
Kangning, you don't look well.
I hope you're not upset.

939
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,400
Fuhui, stop teasing me.
Can't you see Mother is also annoyed?

940
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,160
It's so annoying

941
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,640
that I'm going crazy.

942
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,720
Mother, if you're so anxious,

943
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,280
it's better to hire a good matchmaker
to talk with them directly.

944
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,960
You silly girl, you don't know anything.

945
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,600
Go away.

946
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,120
You think Mother doesn't want to?

947
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,200
These past few days,

948
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,440
I have inquired clearly.

949
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,760
That Du Yangxi is very aloof.

950
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,440
He publicly refused
the Liu family's marriage proposal.

951
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,560
Do you know the Liu family?

952
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,520
They are wealthy and powerful.

953
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,080
On the main street outside Chongming Gate,
more than half of the shops are theirs.

954
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,840
Now that the news has spread,

955
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,280
everyone praises him

956
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,920
for his modesty and high integrity
and thinks he's a true gentleman.

957
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,280
He rejected a wealthy and noble family.

958
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,880
How could he possibly fancy
the daughter of a humble tea house?

959
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,040
As for that Sang…

960
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,760
- Sang Yanrang.
- Right.

961
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,960
When he was at Xingguo Temple,

962
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,440
he either read in his room
or sold calligraphy at their stall.

963
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,160
He never mingled

964
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,400
with other scholars.

965
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,080
Because of his reticence,

966
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,120
people gave him
the nickname "Sang the Stone".

967
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,240
He's also a strange one.

968
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,400
So what?

969
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,040
On the day of heavy snow,
if my family hadn't kindly taken him in

970
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,960
and offered food and medicine,
he'd be dead of hunger or cold somewhere.

971
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,480
If he dares not to repay the kindness,

972
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,800
Mother will make him notorious
in Bianjing.

973
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,160
A marriage obtained by imposing gratitude
will only lead to endless dislike

974
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,280
and hostility.

975
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,160
Mother, we know
you want to marry off Kangning.

976
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,520
But you can't push her into a pit of fire.

977
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,960
Haode is right.

978
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,960
Unless this marriage
is something he pursues by all means.

979
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,080
That will be even more difficult.

980
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,920
We can't have a girl
waiting in the boudoir

981
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,280
to propose first, right?

982
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,120
What's that over there?

983
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,720
Mother worries that none of them
will pass the exams.

984
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,680
She had me move all of their old books and
writings here to find out more about them.

985
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,600
Got it.

986
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,720
They said one can't do business
with a chasing heart.

987
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,440
If we want them to come asking willingly,

988
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,440
we have to set up slowly.

989
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,360
Ask them to give the books back to me.

990
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,160
Andao,

991
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,520
no one has kidnapped your books.

992
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,600
It's the physician who said
you've just come around.

993
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,560
- You shouldn't be too tired.
- I'll say it again.

994
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,120
I want my books.
Tell them to return them to me.

995
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,440
If I can't smell the fragrance of books,
I am truly going to die.

996
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,080
My books. I want my books.

997
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,960
