EPISODE 9

2
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,760
Sister, have some more porridge.

3
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,200
Thank you. Sorry for the trouble.

4
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,680
Not at all.

5
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,280
Madam.

6
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,360
Master Du has returned. He's outside.

7
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,760
Quick. Invite him in.

8
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,160
Alas.

9
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,360
- I'll excuse myself now.
- I'll excuse myself now.

10
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,560
Mom, I'm back.

11
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,880
Yangxi. My dear Yangxi.

12
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,200
- Here.
- Yangxi.

13
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,520
- It's me.
- Yangxi.

14
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,240
Mom, you've traveled far.

15
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,120
Forgive me for not being there.
It's my failure as a son.

16
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,040
Alright, alright. Have a seat.

17
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,240
You're finally reunited.

18
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,120
Wipe those tears away.

19
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,440
I'll have two more dishes made.

20
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,480
Let's celebrate your reunion.

21
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,600
Master Du, before taking her back,

22
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,960
have a meal first.

23
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,440
Thank you for the effort.

24
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,280
It's no trouble, not at all.

25
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,280
Sorry for the trouble.

26
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,240
Mom, how did you come here?

27
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,640
The Liu family wanted to take you
as their son-in-law,

28
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,120
so they got me here by force.

29
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,200
If I didn't meet some kind souls,

30
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,800
I might never have seen you again.

31
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,240
Qiongnu.

32
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
- Shouhua?
- The Du family left?

33
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,400
They just left. Do you need something?

34
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,680
After seeing Aunt Du,

35
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,400
Kangning hasn't left her room?

36
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,000
Come here. I need a word with you.

37
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,560
Something happened!

38
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,400
Something happened.

39
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,880
A drunken soldier startled a horse
by Pan Restaurant.

40
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,000
The horse hit Master Chai.

41
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,080
He…

42
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,360
It's so late.

43
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,240
Where are you going?

44
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,280
Seems like

45
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,880
the horse didn't scare Master Chai.

46
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,920
It scared my sister instead.

47
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,080
Shouhua, you lied to me.

48
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,560
You're too clever for that.

49
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,400
How could you believe such a lie?

50
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,480
People watching you two argue

51
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,280
might really think you've both moved on.

52
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,880
How could I know your true feelings
if I didn't test you?

53
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,320
Shouhua, I…

54
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,560
Kangning,

55
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,000
Aunt Du's here.

56
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,320
If you're backing out,

57
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,480
this is your last chance.

58
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,400
From now on, there's no turning back.

59
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,480
Who is the one you care about?

60
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,240
Think carefully about it.

61
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,680
I'll go.

62
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,680
Kangning.

63
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,240
He's waiting outside. Go.

64
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,360
Why are you doing this?

65
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,880
You ruined my marriage,

66
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,160
but I can't block your path?

67
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,680
You're just trying to go against me?

68
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,200
I've paved every step for you

69
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,840
and you really had no idea?

70
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,800
Even a heartless person

71
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,440
should be touched by my sincerity by now.

72
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,440
Why did you conspire with Baniang?

73
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,040
When I found out, I was devastated.

74
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,920
Why didn't you ask me about marriage?

75
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You used force instead.

76
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,600
What did Aunt Du do to you?

77
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,720
Why drag her into it?

78
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,360
If you really wanted to persuade
your mother, couldn't you

79
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,200
try to move her
with rationale and emotions?

80
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,480
You had to lie, trick, and scheme?

81
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,400
Is my family so shameful?

82
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,160
You can fool her for a moment,
but can you fool her forever?

83
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,880
My mom and Madam Li
hold grudges against each other.

84
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,600
It'll take time to mend that.

85
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,440
I'll try to mediate slowly.

86
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,080
But now, you're about to engage.

87
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,640
Did you even leave me any choice?

88
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,440
I didn't want to lie or trick either.

89
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,560
But it's you.

90
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,000
You left me no choice but to scheme.

91
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,440
Why? Does this hurt your pride?

92
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,760
Is she holding a grudge?

93
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,800
Or does she see my family as unworthy?

94
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,360
Master Chai, do you really think

95
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,680
it is only your mom who looks down on me?

96
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,400
Since we're being honest,

97
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,560
there are some harsh things I have to ask,

98
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,400
even if it would make you hate me.

99
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,760
Is your family some noble lineage?

100
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,080
A household of scholars?

101
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,040
Or has your mother never sought
fame and fortune,

102
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,480
connections with the wealthy?

103
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,440
- What?
- If Yuanming weren't a scholar,

104
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,360
would Madam Li even look at him?

105
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,720
People see a servant in your house,

106
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,480
nearly humiliated by a scoundrel.

107
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,680
They talk behind your mother's back

108
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,840
about how she treats her servant.

109
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,680
That gossip reached my mother.
She is, of course, concerned.

110
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,880
Do you expect her

111
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,680
to beg for this marriage?

112
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,520
Is that what you want?

113
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,600
But your family is your family,

114
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,880
and you are you.

115
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,600
I'm marrying you, not your family.

116
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,800
I don't care about these issues.

117
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,640
So, why do you?

118
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,200
Fine words.

119
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,360
You say you don't look down on us,

120
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,000
but you are looking down everywhere.

121
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,880
You love the purity of the lotus flower,

122
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,720
but forget that
it's rooted in the mud below.

123
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,320
Without the mud that loves
and protects it,

124
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,840
it wouldn't survive the rain and wind.

125
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,520
My mother has many flaws,

126
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,000
but she doesn't rob or steal
and only stands on her own feet.

127
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,920
She raised five daughters alone.

128
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,800
To me, she's worth more than gold.

129
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,920
I won't let anyone insult her.

130
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,120
- I…
- Master Chai,

131
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,400
go ahead

132
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,280
and find a bride from the noble families.

133
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,520
Why should I let myself be humiliated?

134
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,280
A simple girl from a small family like me

135
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,600
will settle where I belong.

136
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,440
I swear today,

137
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,840
even if I grow old unmarried,

138
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,640
I'll never set foot in your family!

139
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,040
Kangning. Kangning!

140
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,800
Kangning.

141
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,040
The snow is coming down.

142
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,200
Our lady said,

143
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,480
let's have Master Du
share a room with Sang for a night.

144
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,720
Tomorrow, we'll prepare a proper room.

145
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,360
Aunt Du can move in then.

146
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,680
Thanks.

147
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,720
Mom,

148
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,160
you must be exhausted from the trip.

149
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,080
- Let me prepare a foot soak for you.
- This cotton feels so thick.

150
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,840
Yangxi,

151
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,760
the Li family treats you well.

152
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,280
How will you repay them?

153
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,600
Kneel.

154
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,320
I've heard of many scholars

155
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,800
thinking they're rare treasures,

156
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,120
always trying to push one's luck.

157
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,480
Just waiting to sell themselves high.

158
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,720
I thought, such people
didn't deserve respect.

159
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,880
I taught you to be grateful,

160
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,680
but have you forgotten everything?

161
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,880
Mom,

162
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,160
I get it.

163
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,760
I'll propose marriage tomorrow.

164
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,600
Two bowls, please.

165
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,720
Thanks.

166
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,640
WINTER SOLSTICE

167
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,120
Here you go.

168
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,800
- Okay.
- Thanks.

169
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,040
Here you go. Thank you.
Be careful. It's hot.

170
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,640
Can't catch him.

171
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,800
Got it, got it.

172
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,640
- Got it.
- Slow down.

173
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,560
Toys.

174
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,080
Pinwheel.

175
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,520
Take a look.

176
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,080
Wait for me.

177
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,640
Many thanks, sir.

178
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,640
Cousin,

179
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,080
why turn down

180
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,520
a beauty like that?

181
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,880
Master Fan,

182
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,720
are you scared of your wife's wrath?

183
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,920
Don't be scared.

184
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,400
She naps in the afternoon anyway.

185
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,960
That's right.

186
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,480
Get out.

187
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,200
All of you!

188
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,920
Let's go.

189
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,120
- Chai An!
- I had such a good time.

190
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,400
Why are you ruining it?

191
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,400
My mother-in-law is marrying off
Kangning to Du Yangxi.

192
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,120
Did you hear? Kangning's getting married!

193
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,520
So what?

194
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,960
It has nothing to do with me.

195
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,800
Fine. Guess I shouldn't have meddled.

196
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,200
Not my problem anymore.

197
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,440
Mom, it's the Winter Solstice.

198
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,040
I made new shoes for you. See if they fit.

199
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,840
- Try them on later, okay?
- Sure.

200
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
I made some too.

201
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,960
- Mom.
- See. Me too.

202
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,720
- Look at mine.
- I made a peace bracelet.

203
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,400
Here, wear it.

204
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,600
I made it myself.

205
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,560
It means peace and safety.

206
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,120
- Wear it for me, okay?
- Good girl.

207
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,120
Wontons are ready.

208
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,960
Here.

209
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,320
They are colorful.

210
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
I want this.

211
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,600
- Here.
- Give me one.

212
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,640
Here.

213
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
This looks good.

214
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,560
Mom, did you really agree to the proposal?

215
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,960
Yes, he's a future jinshi.

216
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,320
The Liu family couldn't get such a match.
Of course, I agreed.

217
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,560
Mom settled it with the Du family.

218
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,720
The wedding's after the results
come out in the second month.

219
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,520
Does Kangning want to marry him?

220
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,680
I'll do as Mom says.

221
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,000
That's the spirit.

222
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,520
Eat up.

223
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,440
I got a yellow croaker filling.

224
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,000
- This pink one is…
- Let me try.

225
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,400
Don't eat mine. You have your own.

226
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,960
- Let me try yours.
- I want yellow croaker.

227
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,840
- I want this.
- No.

228
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,160
Is it good?

229
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,840
- Mine's better.
- No, mine's better.

230
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,360
Cousin,

231
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,360
you're trying to marry her.

232
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,440
How could you say something this hurtful?

233
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,040
Kangning was ready to say yes.

234
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,800
If only you said some gentle words,

235
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,960
she'd break the engagement for you.

236
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,480
But your harsh words

237
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,960
made her angry
and she changed her mind again.

238
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,320
Cousin,

239
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,920
you're smart.

240
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,600
How could you mess this up?

241
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,040
Did I not tell the truth?

242
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,480
These days,

243
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,680
I've done so much for her.

244
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,960
She feels that she's shamed,

245
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,840
so she wants to cut ties.

246
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,840
She's so heartless.

247
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,640
Why should I beg her again?

248
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,480
Never.

249
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,920
Cousin,

250
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,400
the Li family isn't like the others.

251
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,000
How are they different?

252
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
My mom's a widow too.
She raised her kids with hardship,

253
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,600
but she still values virtue.

254
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,560
Not everyone's like the Li family,

255
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,440
always calculating profits,

256
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,160
teaching their daughters like this,

257
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,000
turning marriage into a deal.

258
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,840
Cousin, this time, you're wrong.

259
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,280
Get in.

260
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,800
She's so young and pretty.

261
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,640
She'll remarry soon, right?

262
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,760
All this property

263
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,280
will be someone else's.

264
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,360
Of course!

265
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,800
All these belong to the Li family.

266
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,200
Move it all out. Don't leave anything.

267
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,720
Take it all.

268
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,080
- Let's move this out.
- Okay.

269
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,000
Move all the stuff. Let's do it.

270
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,080
This one's nice.

271
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,000
You…

272
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,960
Good stuff.

273
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,560
Grab this stuff.

274
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,040
And this.

275
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,440
Take this too.

276
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,000
- Alright.
- And this one.

277
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,360
- That was from my dad!
- Kangning.

278
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,080
Can you even hold onto it?

279
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,320
- I said don't--
- You can't take this.

280
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,920
- Give it back!
- No.

281
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,760
Kid.

282
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,120
You bastard.

283
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,560
- Get up.
- Leave here.

284
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,520
Get out of here.

285
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,320
Robber! Bastard!

286
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,600
You…

287
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,640
Get out!

288
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,800
Out, all of you!

289
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,800
Get out.

290
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm telling you,
if you don't give us a hundred or so,

291
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,920
we'll be back tomorrow and the day after.

292
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,240
Can you kill us all?

293
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,240
- Let's go.
- That's right.

294
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,880
Let's go.

295
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,280
It's okay.

296
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,240
This one is for you.

297
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,800
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

298
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
- I want one too.
- It's pretty.

299
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,840
I want this.

300
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,680
This is for me.

301
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,200
Stop it. I like that.

302
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,480
Why are you here alone?

303
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,520
This one looks great.

304
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,760
I want that one.

305
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,760
This year, Fuhui is home with us.

306
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,520
- I'll help Mom pick one.
- It's so nice.

307
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,360
When family can gather
and everyone is safe and sound,

308
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,280
that's the happiest life.

309
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,960
Look at you, messy like a kitten.

310
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,360
The late husband's assets go
to his widow and daughter per Song's rule.

311
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,160
Such blatant looting.

312
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,280
No one stopped them?

313
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,600
Of course, there was someone.

314
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,120
The magistrate sentenced them to prison.

315
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,800
Even the neighbors tried to mediate,

316
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,440
but the fights never ended.

317
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,840
While others happily celebrated
Winter Solstice and New Year,

318
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,520
their family feared every festival,
afraid that those bandits would come.

319
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,080
Cousin, if you were Madam Li,

320
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,120
could you have done better?

321
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,800
Why tell me this so late?

322
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,760
Fuhui didn't let me tell you.

323
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,200
Don't blame Kangning.

324
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,640
She's not greedy.

325
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,840
She just wants a peaceful life.

326
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,240
They knew from a young age

327
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,680
that they must stick together

328
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,480
to survive in this world.

329
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,600
Trying to trick your own mother
with outsiders?

330
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,080
Thought you could fool me?

331
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,560
I'm telling you,

332
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,840
I'll never approve of you marrying her.

333
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,080
Mom, Kangning is marrying someone else.

334
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,200
You don't need to worry anymore.

335
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,480
Are you happy now?

336
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,080
Son,

337
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,920
Mom only wants the best for you.

338
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,680
FIRST MONTH IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR

339
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,280
So pretty.

340
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,080
No sneaking bites.

341
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,640
There are so many.

342
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,920
I'll just take one.

343
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,480
This batch wasn't easy to make.

344
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,640
Mom woke me up

345
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,080
before dawn

346
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,400
- just to help her.
- Today's the provincial exam.

347
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,920
Mom says Kangning
must make the cakes herself.

348
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,360
Only then is it sincere,

349
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,640
right?

350
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,200
Deliver them. Hurry up.

351
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,280
Can I see him now?

352
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,040
I know. We're about to be family.

353
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,120
I'm off to deliver this
to my brother-in-law-to-be.

354
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,800
Careful. Don't ruin them.

355
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,720
Don't worry, I won't.

356
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,920
Mom.

357
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,800
Go prepare stuff for the altar.

358
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,960
Hurry.

359
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,800
- Wake up. Let's go.
- Why should it be me again?

360
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,240
EXAM HOUSE

361
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,120
Bless us, Buddha.

362
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,120
Bless my future son-in-law.

363
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,080
Let him pass, achieve glory,

364
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,120
and become a jinshi.

365
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,600
Please.

366
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,560
Kangning,

367
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,640
if Du Yangxi passes,
you'll have to marry him.

368
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,400
With Mom praying so fervently,

369
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,760
are you hoping he passes or not?

370
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,560
The results are out.

371
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,520
The results are out. Let's take a look.

372
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,880
It's too early.

373
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,960
Go back to sleep.

374
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,520
The results are out.

375
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,480
Kangning, let's go.

376
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,000
Let's do the treasure hunt.

377
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,160
The Lantern Festival is over.

378
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,840
Go back to bed.

379
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,920
Today, His Majesty visits Peaks Temple.

380
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,160
He'll return late.

381
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,400
The streets are packed.

382
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,560
Everyone's rushing
to see him at Xuande Gate.

383
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,320
I'm tired.

384
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,200
Kangning.

385
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,440
Please go with us.

386
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,560
It's a once-in-a-lifetime scene.

387
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,720
The best finds are after the crowd clears.

388
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,880
If we don't go now,
the others will take everything.

389
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,720
I'm not going.

390
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,960
- Kangning.
- Bedtime.

391
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,520
Go away.

392
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,280
- Let's go.
- Hey, you.

393
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
Let's go.

394
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,680
If you go without me, I'll tell Mom.

395
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,120
Hurry up.

396
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,120
Keep it down,
or Mom won't let anyone leave.

397
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,000
Be quiet.

398
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,280
Take your shoes off.

399
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,160
Kangning, look at this.

400
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,200
What do you think?

401
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,040
It's all trampled.

402
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,400
There's a big one here.

403
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,680
- Take it back for Mom.
- No.

404
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,880
Look at this.

405
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,600
What is it?

406
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,920
Put it on me.

407
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,600
- How is it? Is it pretty?
- It is pretty.

408
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,280
But just only one.

409
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,280
Look at me.

410
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,840
What?

411
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,760
Let's see if there's anything else.

412
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,720
Could it be him?

413
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,560
Kangning, what have you found?

414
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,040
I searched for a long time
and only found this.

415
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,720
- Sisters, come here.
- On my way.

416
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,200
What's this?

417
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,480
A hairpin. It's perfect for Mom.

418
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,920
It's not as good as mine.

419
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,080
What are you looking at?

420
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,840
Nothing. The sun's going to rise soon.

421
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,560
If we don't go back now,
Mom might catch us red-handed.

422
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,520
- Let's go.
- Let's go back.

423
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,720
Let's head back.

424
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,560
Where did this good stuff come from?

425
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,400
Everything we picked up today was good.

426
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,240
<i>Could it be him?</i>

427
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,920
Was it perfectly placed?

428
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,440
Yeah.

429
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,440
- Let me.
- It's okay.

430
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,960
I don't know how many days
I can serve by Mom's side.

431
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,480
Go. Search over there.

432
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,560
What happened? Let's take a look.

433
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,760
Leshan, what's all the excitement about?

434
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,880
Mom.

435
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,040
The palace guards
are out questioning people.

436
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,520
They say Her Majesty's carriage

437
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,640
passed through the street.

438
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,880
Something precious was stolen.
I'll go check.

439
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,920
Leshan, wait for me.

440
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,320
- A treasure?
- I'm waiting.

441
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,000
What kind of treasure?

442
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,760
Check it out and tell me later.
I'll be waiting to hear.

443
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,040
What are you hiding?

444
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,760
Come here.

445
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,200
Such a fine pearl

446
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,320
must not be from an ordinary home.

447
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,480
Could it be from the palace?

448
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,200
Let me hand it over.

449
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,760
Didn't Leshan say?

450
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,440
It's stolen!

451
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,920
If we hand it over now,
we'll be seen as thieves.

452
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,160
We were just hunting.

453
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,240
Whoever sees it gets it.

454
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,040
How did this turn into trouble?

455
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,320
Let's just throw it away.

456
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,800
If someone picks it up unknowingly,

457
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,400
they'll get in trouble. I'll feel bad.

458
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,240
That won't work either.

459
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,040
How about we put it back
and hide nearby to watch?

460
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,960
At dawn, the guards will find it.

461
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,240
It'll go back to its owner.

462
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,640
Okay, that's the way.

463
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,840
Do it now. I'll keep watch for you.

464
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,800
The palace lost the luminous pearl.

465
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,120
Why are you so scared?

466
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,960
It's you. Take it back, quickly.

467
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,120
Don't worry, Kangning.

468
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,640
Remember when we first met?

469
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,080
I broke your comb by mistake.

470
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,560
This is just to make it up to you.

471
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,000
I kept it out of selfishness.

472
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,360
I even had a replica made for you.

473
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,440
I planned to surprise you

474
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,880
when proposing.

475
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,480
I'm not lucky enough

476
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,320
to marry you.

477
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,120
I was foolish

478
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,800
and said things that hurt you.

479
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,880
Please forgive me

480
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,480
for my temper.

481
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,360
With the exam results coming soon,

482
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,640
a wedding is not far off.

483
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,400
I have nothing else for you.

484
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,320
This comb is my wedding gift to you.

485
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,320
Kangning, someone's coming.

486
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,960
The time I miss most

487
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,240
is when we used to argue.

488
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,360
Sadly,

489
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,880
I don't think

490
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,880
I will have the chance again in this life

491
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,360
to be tricked by you again.

492
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,080
Go back now.

493
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,040
Kangning, let's go.

494
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,480
Take it back.

495
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,120
Even if you don't want it,
you shouldn't throw it.

496
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,480
I drew it from memory.
There won't be a second one on earth.

497
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,120
Do you still miss

498
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,280
the days of me tricking you?

499
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,560
Master Chai,

500
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,040
thank you for your kindness,

501
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,600
but I'm getting married.

502
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,560
I can't accept gifts from another man.

503
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,320
Such a treasure. Keep it for yourself.

504
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,920
Give it to your future wife.

505
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,800
Take care.

506
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,240
I don't know this one either.

507
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,400
- Let's go.
- Who passed?

508
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,920
SECOND DAY OF THE SECOND MONTH

509
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,160
Excuse me. Make way.

510
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,320
- I passed!
- There.

511
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,800
- Passed.
- Congrats!

512
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,120
Congrats to you.

513
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,920
Why didn't I make it?

514
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,400
You're looking at it wrong.

515
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,120
That's my name.

516
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,560
I'm on the list too!

517
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,480
- I'm sixth place!
- I passed!

518
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,640
You're the provincial top scorer!

519
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,240
Provincial top scorer!

520
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,360
- Let's go, sir.
- Hurry up.

521
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,480
You're the top one.

522
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,680
- Sir.
- Sir.

523
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,600
- Yuanming.
- Sir.

524
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,960
- Sir, come with us.
- Yuanming.

525
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,400
Yuanming.

526
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,800
Yuanming.

527
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,960
- Sir.
- My husband…

528
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,560
Don't let them go. Take them home.

529
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,040
Wait, no.

530
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,680
I can't remember. Wrong again.

531
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,800
Will anyone even come?

532
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,280
On the second day of the second month,
the roads are packed.

533
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,160
Not everyone goes out.

534
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,080
Come to our place,
guess the names of the wild veggies.

535
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,520
Those who guess it right
can win stationery,

536
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,160
silk, or tea sets as prizes.

537
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,800
If you guess it wrong,
just take it as fun.

538
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,120
Later, we'll hold a veggie-picking feast.

539
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,520
We can sell spring wine too.
To earn a little extra.

540
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,360
Passed! Passed!

541
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,520
What did he win?

542
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,800
He ranked first in the exams!

543
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,920
Provincial top scorer!

544
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,880
What?

545
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,240
Sis,

546
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,840
my son-in-law, your son, ranked first!

547
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,080
Provincial top scorer!

548
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,960
Alright, alright, I heard it.

549
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,160
I know you're happy. I'm thrilled too.

550
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,800
Thank you, Buddha.

551
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,920
Where's Master Du?

552
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,520
I haven't seen him. He's probably hiding.

553
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,240
Hiding?

554
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,520
The wealthy and officials

555
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,040
camped outside the Ministry of Rites
since midnight,

556
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,040
waiting for the results.
It's like a swarm of bees.

557
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,720
It's a crazier scene
than a slaughterhouse.

558
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,320
You fool! Go send someone to fetch him.

559
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,440
Go.

560
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,200
- Go get help from the front shop.
- Okay.

561
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,240
Chunlai, fireworks.

562
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,120
No. I need to save my son-in-law first.

563
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,920
- My son-in-law.
- Mom.

564
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,120
- No rush.
- What--

565
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,080
Oops, spoke too soon.

566
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,120
Sorry, sis.

567
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,480
Seeing him is pure joy.

568
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,120
I didn't think I'd call it too early.

569
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,440
Not early. He's your son-in-law for sure.

570
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,040
Now, we need to plan the wedding fast.

571
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,720
Let's do it. Right away.

572
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,640
Come. Help me decide.

573
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,480
Both of them are great.

574
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,760
She's the daughter of the Court Attendant.

575
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,400
She's 17, writes amazing poetry,

576
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,200
and carries herself with grace.

577
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,160
But her eyes are a bit small.

578
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,800
She's already quite pretty.

579
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,520
Look at this one.

580
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,080
The daughter of the Cavalry Officer.
She's 19.

581
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,760
She's a real beauty.

582
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,120
But sadly, her mother passed early,

583
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,520
and her stepmother may not care much
about her etiquette.

584
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,520
Mom.

585
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,120
Mom, Aunt, there's big news.

586
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,320
Is there anything I haven't faced?

587
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,480
Even within chaos, I stay composed.

588
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,600
Why are you so flustered?

589
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,320
How bad can it be? Look at you.

590
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,200
Aunt, brother is going to sail away.

591
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,880
Congratulations, Madam Li.

592
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,120
Your sharp eye

593
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,560
found a great son-in-law.

594
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,120
This must be destiny.

595
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,320
Congrats.

596
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,240
Congrats.

597
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,800
They're such a perfect match.

598
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,200
Son, where are you sailing to?

599
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,720
Aunt, why not let me finish?

600
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,920
Next month, he's off to Quanzhou.

601
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,560
He'll sail with foreign merchants

602
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,360
to the Arab lands
to sell silk and porcelain.

603
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,160
Son, why leave your big family business

604
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,800
and do business at sea instead?

605
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,080
What do you want?

606
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,680
Aunt, that's not fair to say.

607
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,920
If he brings our Song silk and porcelain

608
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,040
overseas,

609
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,880
he can bring back a lot of frankincense.

610
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,960
It's hugely profitable.

611
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,640
They say the Quanzhou merchants

612
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,680
even harvest oil from stranded whales.

613
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,880
It's a lucrative trade.

614
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,080
It's worth a try.

615
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,080
Though the seas can be rough.

616
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,880
Exactly. Strong winds and waves.

617
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,400
What if the ship capsizes?

618
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,480
Aunt, don't worry too much.

619
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,000
I hear the Quanzhou ships

620
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,480
are as tall as mansions,
with sails towering into the clouds.

621
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,360
They can carry 2,000 bushels of rice.

622
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,720
They are not easy to flip,
unless they hit a major storm.

623
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,440
But who can predict that?

624
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,920
What if he does hit a big storm?

625
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,640
Are you trying to scare me?

626
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,000
Aunt, please don't stress.

627
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,120
You've seen so much in life.

628
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,720
He won't be so unlucky. He'll be fine.

629
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,440
But the Arab lands are far.

630
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,840
Three to five years with no word.

631
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,680
You should be prepared.

632
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,480
Shut up.

633
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,800
You're my only son,

634
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,840
the apple of my eye.

635
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,200
If you leave,

636
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,640
you'll break my heart.

637
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,120
- What day is it today?
- The second day of the second month.

638
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,840
It's the day for the Ministry results.

639
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,840
The second day of the second month.

640
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,120
It should've been my wedding day.

641
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,640
Son, I…

642
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,800
Mom, my trade routes

643
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,760
have covered all of the Song,

644
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,920
but I've never sailed abroad.

645
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,320
I've always heard foreign merchants

646
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,680
talking about Arab lands and Murabit.

647
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,480
This time, I want to see it for myself.

648
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,480
I promise you,

649
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,160
I'll return safely

650
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,080
as soon as possible.

651
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,120
Don't worry about me.

652
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,600
Take care of yourself.

653
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,760
I leave the day after tomorrow.

654
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,480
I still have many things to arrange.

655
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,200
I'll head off now.

656
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,120
Cousin.

657
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,080
Aunt.

658
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,600
He's made up his mind.

659
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,760
No one can stop him.

660
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,320
You probably should accept it.

661
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,160
Go, prepare a generous gift.

662
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,360
I'm heading to the Li family.

663
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,840
Both families agreed on this match.

664
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,760
The betrothal letter was exchanged,

665
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,240
and by rule, this marriage
should have been agreed upon.

666
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,880
But the Matchmaking God

667
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,160
forgot the red string.

668
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,680
A few words from us have ruined it.

669
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,160
Madam Chai, so it's just a few words?

670
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,760
It's my fault, all my fault.

671
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,040
I listened to nonsense gossip
and didn't think it through.

672
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:24,320
I've wronged our good in-laws.

673
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,000
Today, I came to apologize.

674
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,720
My dear in-law,

675
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,960
you're so kind and forgiving.
Please forgive me.

676
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,680
Don't let my foolishness

677
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,440
ruin a heaven-sent match.

678
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,960
Oh no, don't say that.

679
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,360
I'm just a humble tea seller.

680
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,480
I can't be compared
to the prestigious Chai family.

681
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,360
Being your in-law

682
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,960
is out of my league.

683
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,320
But, you know,

684
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,080
even poor families are blessed by heaven.

685
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,560
See those people lining up outside
with their betrothal letters?

686
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,400
They're here to meet
the new provincial top scorer.

687
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,520
Do you know what it is?

688
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,760
The top scorer in the civil exams.

689
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,600
In the capital, where riches abound,

690
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,040
a top scorer is one in a million.

691
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,400
A talent like that

692
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,680
could marry into any noble family.

693
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,160
Am I right?

694
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,200
And yet he chose Kangning
for her character and looks.

695
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,120
He can't wait to marry into our family.

696
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,720
This is far better than peeking
at someone through a crack in the door.

697
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,640
- Right?
- You're right.

698
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,360
I was blind and arrogant.

699
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,560
I offended you.

700
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,840
I deeply regret my actions.

701
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,000
But you've burnt the bridge.

702
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,040
How can there be a way back?

703
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,280
Don't bow to me.

704
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,560
Even if you kneel down, I can't--

705
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,720
Don't do this.

706
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,080
If kneeling could make you agree,

707
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,760
I'd do it.

708
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,240
You should've thought of this sooner.

709
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,040
In-law,

710
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,360
breaking the engagement was my idea.

711
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,120
My son didn't want to break it at all.

712
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,920
When he heard
she was promised to someone else,

713
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,040
he was so heartbroken
that he decided to sail away.

714
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,600
Please.

715
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,160
We're both widowed at a young age.

716
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,520
You have five daughters to rely on,

717
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,960
but I only have this one son.

718
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,240
If you save him, you save my whole family.

719
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,200
Madam,

720
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,920
someone from the Du family

721
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,080
is here to discuss the betrothal.

722
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,440
Madam Chai,

723
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,920
it's not that I don't want to,

724
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,120
but I only have one Kangning,

725
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,240
and she's already promised
to the Du family.

726
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,280
The formal betrothal is in three days.

727
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,480
There's no turning back.

728
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,320
- Please leave.
- I…

729
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,480
Please just go.

730
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,320
After I leave,

731
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,440
keep feeding it this top-quality hay.

732
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,720
Pick fresh, leafy ones for it.

733
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,120
It's impatient, so go easy on the oats.

734
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,280
- Don't let it feel wronged.
- Understood.

735
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,920
Cousin! Cousin!

736
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,280
Are you really leaving?

737
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,280
Kangning hasn't had the wedding yet.

738
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,680
So, she hasn't married yet.

739
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,080
Go talk to her.

740
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,920
All that "men don't kneel" talk.
It's just for show.

741
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,960
At home, we kneel
to heaven, earth, and parents.

742
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,000
One more kneel for a beauty will break it?

743
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,120
Proves they're fragile.

744
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,320
Kangning got a good match.

745
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,000
We should be happy for her.

746
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,040
I won't go,
and you better not make trouble.

747
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,080
Enough. I'm busy.

748
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,800
Leave me alone.

749
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,640
Go tell my mother I'm doing fine.

750
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,280
Cousin.

751
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,280
You're so noble and generous,

752
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,520
handing over a good woman.

753
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,680
Let's see if you'll regret it.

754
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,080
Looks just like its owner.

755
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,960
Master Fan.

756
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,840
Master Fan, the mistress is calling.

757
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,120
