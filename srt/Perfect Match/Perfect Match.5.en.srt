EPISODE 5

2
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,000
PAN RESTAURANT

3
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,880
Say that again, I dare you.

4
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,640
Master Fan, let's talk this over.

5
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,280
For my sake,

6
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,120
please let him go first.

7
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,080
The Li family?

8
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,800
They're nothing special.

9
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,160
With just a beckon,

10
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,880
they'd come running into my arms.

11
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,920
You…

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,360
drunk yourself silly.

13
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,160
This is Fuhui's husband in front of you.

14
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,520
What nonsense are you spouting?

15
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,640
Stop pretending.

16
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,240
Don't you know?

17
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,040
Those perfume sellers,

18
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,400
those so-called Jinnu and Yunu,

19
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,920
are all from the Li family!

20
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,680
Mr. Fan,

21
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,840
which sister-in-law of yours
might that be?

22
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,400
You're asking for it!

23
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,760
Master Fan!

24
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,120
Just hold your tongue.

25
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,200
You heard this bastard's words.

26
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,680
Don't stop me!

27
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,880
What's new?

28
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,160
Every time he drinks,

29
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,600
he spews such drivel.

30
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,960
Yesterday, it was Lady Zhang,

31
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,680
today, it's Lady Li.

32
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,360
Tomorrow, who knows?
Maybe someone from the palace.

33
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,920
Exactly.

34
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,160
He's clueless, rambling on like a fool.
He'll forget it all when he sobers up.

35
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,640
If you take him seriously,

36
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
you'll be the real joke.

37
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,120
Right.

38
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,240
Isn't that so?

39
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,520
In his drunken dreams,

40
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,400
forget the maidens of Bianjing,

41
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,400
even the moon goddess
and fairies of heaven aren't spared.

42
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,360
It's just his lips flapping.

43
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,760
Talking nonsense at will.

44
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,040
Liang Junqing, stop dreaming.

45
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,160
What did you say?

46
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,520
I'm telling you the truth…

47
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,800
Clearly drunk!

48
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,200
Hurry and get him back.

49
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,160
Take him away!

50
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,280
Apologies, everyone.

51
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,480
My deepest apologies.

52
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,640
Excuse me.

53
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,320
Everyone.

54
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,280
Everyone!

55
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,760
A drunken guest caused a scene

56
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,960
and disturbed your peace.

57
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,240
- Deqing.
- Yes?

58
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,160
Two more dishes and a jar of Jade Wine

59
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,240
for every table.

60
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,960
Many thanks, Master Chai.

61
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,520
- Come with me.
- Master Chai, you're too kind.

62
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,040
If not for you stopping me,

63
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,080
I'd smash his head into a pulp!
He brought his insults right to me!

64
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,280
If I didn't stop you,

65
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,720
you'd brawl in Pan Restaurant

66
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,840
and make it known to all.

67
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,840
After that, the Li daughters

68
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,880
would even be shamed

69
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,400
just stepping out the door.

70
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,160
They're delicate girls.
How could they bear such disgrace?

71
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,720
Tomorrow night,

72
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,520
I'll get some men
to teach that filthy dog a lesson.

73
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,640
If you hit him today
and he's harmed tomorrow,

74
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,840
wouldn't that make it clear to all

75
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,880
it was your doing?

76
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,120
I can't care about that!

77
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,240
A son-in-law is half a son.

78
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,800
The Li family's in trouble.
I can't stand by

79
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,760
or let people mock me
as a coward without guts.

80
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,760
Stop there!

81
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,760
His father and brothers are commoners,

82
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,840
but his uncle serves in the court.

83
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,200
The Liang family can't harm you directly.
But can they not go after the Li family?

84
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,320
Her family has just found some peace.

85
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,320
One cannot act on impulse alone.

86
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,960
If this won't do and that won't work,

87
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,080
must we just endure it?

88
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,680
Endure, but enduring
doesn't mean not avenging.

89
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,480
Go back first. Let me think about it.

90
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,600
Brother!

91
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,640
Get lost!

92
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,920
SIFU HOUSE

93
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,040
What are you doing?

94
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,800
I finally get it now.

95
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,880
Sir,

96
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
what can you achieve
by meddling in their matters?

97
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,920
You only get slapped or splashed.

98
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,080
And the water smells like plum blossoms.

99
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,400
Who knows what it's even for?

100
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,880
Why do you always have to speak?

101
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,320
You delivered all the wine today.
Don't pass it off to someone else.

102
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,760
Yes, yes.

103
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,360
I'm just trying to help you.

104
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,680
That Kangning is fierce.

105
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,960
Always up to no good.

106
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,080
Haode and Leshan are watching over her.

107
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,880
She's wildly scared and agitated.

108
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,880
In the end, it's all Chai's fault.

109
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,280
You're wrong.

110
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,800
Liang Junqing's the one to blame,

111
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,400
not Master Chai.

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,040
I've told you already.

113
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,760
Master Chai took the fall
for someone else.

114
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,920
He's been wronged.

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,120
He's in with bad people,
so it means he's not different.

116
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,400
Why lend the jade comb
to him of all people?

117
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,080
If we don't expose him now,
he'll keep calling everyone his brother.

118
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,240
Only because it didn't harm
the Chai girls.

119
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,440
Even if he's wronged,

120
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,760
he can't escape the blame
for poor judgment.

121
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,400
And that Pan Restaurant,

122
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,080
it's a den of vice.

123
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,400
Drunken men come and go every day.
It's either old lechers or young rakes.

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,400
- He's bound to face some retribution.
- You're wronging an innocent person.

125
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,880
In business,
one must deal with all sorts of people.

126
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,800
There's no telling who you'll meet.

127
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,960
He's not a sage with all-seeing eyes.

128
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,960
I don't want to hear his name again. I…
Just hearing his name makes me feel like

129
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,640
all the old grudges
are rushing to my heart.

130
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,320
I can't help but wish
I could kick him again!

131
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,000
Alright, I won't bring him up again.

132
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,200
Alright?

133
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,120
Shouhua, what should we do about Qiongnu?

134
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,360
Mother's furious.

135
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,800
She nearly came over.

136
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,920
I had to stop her.

137
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,200
This must not be made public.

138
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,280
That bastard won't dare
offend the other families,

139
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,680
but he's bold enough to bully us,
strangers in an unfamiliar land.

140
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,920
The Fan family is just a trading family,

141
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,360
not one to push too far.

142
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,000
I think we should deal with Qiongnu later.

143
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,240
Sir, take it easy.

144
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,080
You know where to send news.

145
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,320
Don't worry, sister, I know.

146
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,480
Go on.

147
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,240
Kangning.

148
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,600
Let's go.

149
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,320
Master Chai?

150
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,120
Kangning.

151
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,560
May I have a word with you?

152
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,040
Chunlai, you may leave.

153
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,640
You two, come with me.

154
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,360
I wonder if Master Chai is here

155
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,800
to settle the score for that slap.

156
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,880
Or…

157
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,520
Aren't you going to teach
Liang Junqing a lesson?

158
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,560
I'm here to lend you a hand.

159
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,000
I slapped you, yet you bear no grudge.

160
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,200
And you are willing to help me?

161
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,000
How strange.

162
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,960
He tricked me out of my jade comb

163
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,760
and accused me of indecency.

164
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,280
I can't forgive him for that.

165
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,520
Kangning, I am truly here to help you.

166
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,200
Don't miss this chance.

167
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,800
I wonder how Master Chai

168
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,760
plans to help me.

169
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,920
That depends on your sincerity.

170
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,920
There have been misunderstandings,

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,280
hence my offenses.

172
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,320
You are a noble man.

173
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,920
Please do not blame my rashness.

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,760
I apologize once more.

175
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,680
Kangning,

176
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,560
you're quite adaptable.

177
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,640
May I ask,

178
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,040
how would you take revenge?

179
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,320
Let him enjoy a few more days.

180
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,640
We'll deal with him at Chongyang.

181
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,000
- I'll pick this one.
- Here you are.

182
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,480
- Do you have any in white?
- Alright.

183
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,320
- So fragrant! Here you are.
- Here's the money.

184
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,160
This one looks nice too.

185
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,200
Yes.

186
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,800
Come see the Chongyang cake,

187
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,240
fresh from the oven!

188
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,400
Put them out.

189
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,280
Place them there. This one's good.

190
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,040
Alright, go quickly!

191
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,560
Come see the Chongyang cakes,

192
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,840
fresh from the oven!

193
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,480
Twenty coins per box.

194
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,920
Just out of the oven.

195
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,280
Madam Li.

196
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,800
Your Chongyang cakes,
aren't they just sugar and flour?

197
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,120
Why are they pricier than others?

198
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,080
That's right.

199
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,560
But my cakes come with meaning!

200
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,680
This box, "All Things Well",

201
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,960
it's blessed

202
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,640
by the Lion-Taming King of Bodhisattvas.

203
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,600
If a scholar buys it,

204
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,680
Manjushri will grant wisdom.

205
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,800
It'll boost talent

206
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,160
and bring honor to their ancestors.

207
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,320
But the uncle I'm gifting it to

208
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,640
is an official.

209
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,680
Don't you have something else?

210
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,760
Of course, we do! Come!

211
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,560
Look at this one.

212
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,600
See the little deer?

213
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,600
"Eat the Deer,

214
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,480
Feast on Fortune."

215
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,280
Officials who take it home

216
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,960
will rise step by step.

217
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,160
Your second uncle,

218
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,360
isn't he the oil merchant Master Wang?

219
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,920
- Yes!
- Then, take this one.

220
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,640
Prosperity Cake.

221
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,040
It ensures luck and wealth,

222
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,720
I promise!

223
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,160
I'll take one!

224
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,400
I want one too!

225
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,880
Just a cake

226
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,480
with deer and elephants

227
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,800
and endless meanings!

228
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,680
Kangning, typically you.

229
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,360
We've been at this for seven days.

230
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
Shouhua,

231
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,720
shouldn't you let us out for a break?

232
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,040
The family business is booming

233
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,920
and you just want to play.

234
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,160
Look at Fuhui.

235
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,960
She's been helping all morning.

236
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,360
Didn't I come early too?

237
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,520
Shouhua, please let us out!

238
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,720
Even the lion is saying,

239
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,640
"Let me out! Let me play!"

240
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,720
Shouhua, look.

241
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,000
This one's done too.

242
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,360
I heard of a lion meeting
at Kaibao Temple.

243
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,280
I'd like to hear the master's sermon.

244
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,360
May I go?

245
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,200
Shouhua?

246
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,160
Please let me go.

247
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,520
Please.

248
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,880
Kids will be kids, always wanting to play.

249
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,360
Let them go.

250
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,480
But…

251
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,440
no causing trouble.

252
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,160
I never cause trouble!

253
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,480
You? Never?

254
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,000
Go on, go on.

255
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,560
- But be careful!
- Let's go!

256
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,680
- Hurry up!
- Wait for me!

257
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,000
- Be back early!
- Coming. Wait for me!

258
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,400
Take it slow.

259
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,640
Do you still remember,
during the Chongyang Festival that year,

260
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,320
Haode went to the temple with Mother?

261
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,200
She met a handsome young monk

262
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,120
and secretly followed him.

263
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,680
Thankfully, someone noticed

264
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
and brought her back.

265
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,720
They said he came from
a long line of officials,

266
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,200
sent there fearing he'd die young.
So, they had him raised as a monk.

267
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,520
Qiongnu, do you remember

268
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,000
which family it was?

269
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,680
I just can't recall.

270
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,160
Yes.

271
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,720
I seem to remember that.

272
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,400
But I can't recall, either.

273
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,280
She was only seven that year

274
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,480
and already fancied a handsome man!

275
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,920
Didn't you say Master Chai was here?

276
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,800
That's what the servant said.

277
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,080
Maybe he's not here yet.

278
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,640
Give me two bowls.

279
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,840
Coming right up.

280
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,680
METAL AND STONE ANTIQUES

281
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,040
This golden Mahoraga is so cute!

282
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,160
It's perfect for Fuhui.

283
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,680
Sharp choice, young lady.

284
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,600
The others are clay,

285
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,600
but this one's gold.

286
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,760
A fine symbol of blessings and fertility.

287
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,200
It's just too pricey.

288
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,720
Left unsold after the Qixi Festival.

289
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,160
So, I thought I'd bring it out

290
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,320
to try and make some money.

291
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,520
Would you like
to try your luck, young lady?

292
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,280
- How?
- Five coins a turn.

293
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,280
Get all five coins to land face up

294
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,720
and the golden Mahoraga

295
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
is yours.

296
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,760
I'm good at this. Let's try!

297
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,920
Here we go.

298
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,440
Young lady, you…

299
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,120
Go ahead.

300
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,800
All coins are face up!

301
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,160
The golden Mahoraga is ours now.

302
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,400
Wait, wait!

303
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,840
A bet's a bet.

304
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,560
What's wrong with you?

305
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,920
It's just gold-plated
and you can't even let it go.

306
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,400
Believe me,

307
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,280
I'll flip your stall over.

308
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,320
I wouldn't dare!

309
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,800
It's just that

310
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,640
this Mahoraga

311
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,840
was already won by a young man.

312
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,400
He said he'd come back for it later.

313
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,800
I thought

314
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,760
I could get a few more bets in.

315
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,560
How can you gamble the same thing twice?
Shameless!

316
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,760
No, no, please!

317
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,240
I won it first.

318
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,200
It's mine!

319
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,880
Kangning, don't act on impulse.

320
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,920
Don't forget why we're here today.

321
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,600
Go ahead.

322
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,800
Follow me.

323
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,800
This…

324
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,600
I've long heard of your beauty and wit.

325
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,520
But I think

326
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,080
you're good at everything,

327
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,440
except for one thing.

328
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,200
After crossing paths a few times, I think,

329
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,000
aside from being shrewd and wealthy,

330
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,960
you lack in almost everything else.

331
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,640
I wonder what's the purpose
of this invitation?

332
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,360
Kangning, take a look.

333
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,040
Him?

334
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,280
Master Chai, what does this mean?

335
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,960
Don't rush.

336
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,120
You'll know by tonight.

337
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,920
Don't trick me, Master.

338
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,800
Chunlai, go home and inform them.

339
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,720
Say I've gone to attend the sermon.

340
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,080
Don't let Mother worry.

341
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,000
Got it.

342
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,200
I'll be back soon. Don't go anywhere!

343
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,680
- Great!
- Great!

344
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,040
Wonderful!

345
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,840
Excellent!

346
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,680
Kangning,

347
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,600
these shrimp dumplings are delicious!

348
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,600
- Take them.
- The market's crowded.

349
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,320
We must come here more often.

350
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,880
Master Chai, it's already dark.

351
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,320
How long are we waiting?

352
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,120
So eager for revenge?

353
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,640
If not for someone's vanity

354
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,920
and disregard for propriety,

355
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,880
things wouldn't have come to this.

356
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,640
And yet you defend her.

357
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,120
So foolish.

358
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,280
Seeking fortune and status
is human nature.

359
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,240
A girl with no family support or dowry

360
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,480
just wants someone to rely on.

361
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,880
How is that unforgivable?

362
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,360
Why blame her instead of the culprit?

363
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,400
If it were your own sister,

364
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,760
could you still say that?

365
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,920
Fine, I was wrong.

366
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,280
If you leave now,

367
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,560
today will have been wasted.

368
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,680
The righteous Kangning indeed.

369
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,120
But your stubborn pride will never change.

370
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,160
One day, it'll cost you dearly.

371
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,000
He's here.

372
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,600
Let's go! Come on!

373
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,160
- Kangning.
- Kangning.

374
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,120
Please.

375
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,480
What, think I'd trick you?

376
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,800
Do visit again!

377
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,120
Take care!

378
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,480
Didn't you say you have two sisters?

379
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,520
Both beauties.

380
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,920
Please bring them out!

381
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,120
I'd like to pay my respects.

382
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,960
Why is this room so dim?

383
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,840
I'll have someone light a lamp.

384
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,120
Gosh.

385
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,680
- Who's there?
- Bitch!

386
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,120
I've heard the rumors

387
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,280
that you've been unfaithful.

388
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,880
- Caught you red-handed! Tie them up!
- Let me go!

389
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,960
Sir!

390
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,560
A brute climbed in

391
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,920
to commit a vile act!

392
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,480
I'm innocent!

393
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,960
Let me go!

394
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,160
Spare me!

395
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,200
Quit pretending!

396
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,960
I'll deal with him first,

397
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,240
then you.

398
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,440
Do it!

399
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,640
Let me go!

400
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,040
Let me go!

401
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,760
Let me go!

402
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,440
Enough.

403
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,680
This?

404
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,240
Stop playing dead!

405
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,360
Keep going!

406
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,000
Then strip him
and dump him in the mass grave.

407
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,200
Hit him!

408
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,440
- He won't…?
- Don't worry.

409
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,880
They're trained. They know his limit.

410
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,440
Break his leg,

411
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,040
so he won't harm others again.

412
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,240
It won't kill him.

413
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,160
Aren't you afraid he'll come after you?

414
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,560
He attacked a married woman
and ruined her name.

415
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,200
Caught in the act, beaten by the wronged.

416
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,280
Even if he takes it to court,

417
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,920
he won't dare speak of it.

418
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,880
Besides,

419
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,480
by dawn, we're gone. Who will he find?

420
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,120
It's just bad luck for him.

421
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,160
He ran into the wrong crowd.

422
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,520
This honey trap feels familiar.

423
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,640
I just wanted to remind someone.

424
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,320
Kangning,

425
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,920
act cleanly and thoroughly.

426
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Leave no loose ends.

427
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,280
It's for you.

428
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,320
Really?

429
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,960
We attended the sermon
and wandered around the market.

430
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,280
We came back empty-handed.

431
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,440
This is raising suspicion.

432
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,440
Let's go home.

433
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,040
Let's go.

434
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,520
Here, have some.

435
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,920
You've lost weight.

436
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,360
And you don't go out much lately.

437
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,880
- Qiongnu, you--
- Shouhua.

438
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,040
I'm fine now.

439
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Don't worry about me.

440
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,680
She's loved roasted goose since little.
Let's visit the night market tonight.

441
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,040
That five-flavor almond goose
from Granny Ma.

442
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,640
It's so delicious.

443
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,800
One bite
and all your troubles will vanish.

444
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,040
I heard that Liang

445
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,000
offended some lady

446
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,520
and got his leg broken.

447
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,000
Afraid of more trouble,

448
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,720
he fled to his hometown
Shouzhou overnight.

449
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,320
We won't see him again.

450
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,280
What are you sewing?

451
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,440
That looks fun. Give it to me!

452
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,080
It's for Fuhui.

453
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,320
Oh? Let me see.

454
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,080
Look at you,

455
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,400
clinging to your little treasure.

456
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,680
I'll get her something better next time.

457
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,120
This…

458
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,600
A golden Mahoraga.

459
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,200
I can't accept this.

460
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,480
Next time, just bring a clay one.

461
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,720
Feeling better?

462
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,800
Kangning said we're going
to the night market tonight.

463
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,560
Sounds great. Let's go together.

464
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,440
I heard from my husband

465
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,800
that there's been some thieves
in the city.

466
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,320
They target

467
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,640
wealthy children and young women

468
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,480
in the chaos.

469
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,600
Last month, they took the only daughter
of Master Jiang from the east side.

470
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,760
The authorities have posted notices,

471
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,080
but she's still missing.

472
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,000
You believe that?

473
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,560
He's just scaring you.

474
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,520
I'm on the streets every day

475
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,840
and never heard of such a thing.

476
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,120
Just rumors.

477
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,080
Let's go.

478
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,760
Shouhua, come with us.

479
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,480
I'm not going. You guys go ahead.

480
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,200
But to be safe,

481
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,200
have the Fan family
send a few guards along.

482
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,920
Please, come on!

483
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,560
Alright!

484
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,600
Haode, please! Let's go play!

485
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,120
Drink it while it's hot.

486
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,280
Slowly.

487
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,320
Master Chai, please wait.

488
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,040
No need to see me off.

489
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,440
Fire!

490
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,800
A fire at Cross Street!

491
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,560
What's going on? Look, it's a fire!

492
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,840
Fire's spreading!

493
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,560
Whose place is it this time?

494
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,920
Must've started in the kitchen.

495
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,960
Last time at Shouning Temple,

496
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,680
it was the stove catching the walls.

497
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,880
Look at those flames!

498
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,080
That area's packed with houses.

499
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,800
- Exactly.
- One house after another.

500
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,560
Half the city might go up in flames.

501
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,960
This is bad, really bad!

502
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,640
What are you standing here for?
Our house is at the end of the street!

503
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,880
Hurry and check on it!

504
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,760
- Mother's out traveling.
- Your big house is still there!

505
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,760
Your wealth is going
to be burnt in a flash.

506
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,000
Hurry! You're driving me mad!

507
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,240
- Deqing!
- Yes?

508
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,400
Bring everyone from the restaurant.

509
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,640
Get all the silver from the safe.

510
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,360
No.

511
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,800
It's not enough, not nearly enough!

512
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,120
I'll exchange more silver first.

513
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,040
We'll meet up later.

514
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,600
- Got it!
- Brother!

515
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,720
The fire's at Cross Street,
near your house!

516
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,920
Why are you leaving the city?

517
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,360
- Get ready!
- Yes!

518
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,520
You four, come with me!

519
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,280
You're going the wrong way!
Have you lost your head in the panic?

520
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,600
- What are you doing running off now?
- Move! Mount up!

521
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,800
Let go!

522
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,880
Your pancake, madam.

523
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,840
- Thank you.
- Let's have more fun next time.

524
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,600
- Smells great!
- Good idea!

525
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,600
Madam, have a taste.

526
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,320
- No, thank you.
- Tasty roasted goose.

527
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,040
Look, roasted goose! Let's go!

528
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,320
Hurry!

529
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,600
- Take a look, ladies.
- Let's go look.

530
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,000
- Not full yet?
- Tasty roasted goose!

531
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,280
No, I just want one!

532
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,080
You've already eaten so much.

533
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,040
No more.

534
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,120
Good and cheap!

535
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,360
- Fine, do what you want.
- Please.

536
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,520
- Just one more!
- Suit yourself.

537
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
Steamed buns for sale!

538
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,720
I'll buy it for you.

539
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,920
Which one do you want?

540
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,520
- Qiongnu, let's go.
- I’ll take this one.

541
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,040
Fine pearl necklaces!

542
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,960
I want one too.

543
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
These are South Sea pearls.

544
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,560
Each one is dazzling.

545
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,480
Look at this one.

546
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,280
This little rabbit suits you.

547
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,320
See if there's one you like.

548
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,640
- I like this one!
- I like this one too.

549
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,120
- Let me see that.
- Okay.

550
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,240
- Why not buy one?
- Here, madam.

551
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,560
- Sir.
- Pick your favorite!

552
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,200
Here, you can always get more.

553
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,520
Thank you, Fuhui!

554
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
What about mine?

555
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,240
It's all together.

556
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,160
Young lady, I have even finer ones.

557
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,440
Take a look.

558
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,920
I'll take what my sister picks.

559
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,600
Young lady, you have excellent taste.

560
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,600
My lady,

561
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,040
the cart is ready.

562
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,080
If we don't head back, Master will worry.

563
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,960
It's late. We should go home.

564
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,480
Let's come back another day, alright?

565
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,560
Alright.

566
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,120
Paid!

567
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,560
Let's go.

568
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,400
But I don't want to leave yet!

569
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,720
Come on.

570
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,840
Take care. Come again!

571
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,120
But I'm not done playing!

572
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,520
You're not done? None of us are!

573
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,640
Sister,

574
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,880
there are shadow puppets
and snake charmers over there!

575
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,400
- Let's just take a look!
- Another day.

576
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,120
- How about another day?
- Go. Go home first.

577
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,640
We're heading out first!

578
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,360
- Leshan!
- Great!

579
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,600
- Go with them and keep watching.
- Got it.

580
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,720
Come back early!

581
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,320
Let's go!

582
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,440
Fire!

583
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,920
A fire in the north!

584
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,160
Fire in the north! Clear the way!

585
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,280
Qiongnu, get in the cart!

586
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,480
Qiongnu!

587
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,840
Kangning!

588
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,400
Kangning!

589
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,760
Fuhui!

590
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,840
Stop!

591
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,400
- Fuhui!
- Kangning!

592
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,080
- Kangning!
- Not good!

593
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,080
- Someone! We've been attacked!
- Go report this.

594
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,320
Got it!

595
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,280
- Fuhui!
- Kangning!

596
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,520
Careful. Someone's coming!

597
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,800
- Don't move!
- Stay still!

598
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,280
Quiet!

599
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,120
Brother.

600
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,280
You're the clever one.

601
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,040
The soldiers will handle the fire there.

602
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,320
Even if you go,

603
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,800
you'll just get in the way.

604
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,640
After this fire,

605
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,920
the north will need countless repairs.

606
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,080
I control most of the city's
construction supplies now.

607
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,000
This is the real way to profit.

608
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,920
A single house means nothing.

609
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,640
Later, take the goods to the warehouse.

610
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,800
I have a guest to meet.

611
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,000
Who?

612
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,880
Take less from the common folk.

613
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,240
Don't let them call you
a heartless rich man.

614
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,800
I'll make a fortune.

615
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,040
Not just from the nobles,

616
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,200
but by having someone

617
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,720
report the fire to the palace,

618
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,840
so His Majesty knows the damage,

619
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,840
and I'll have the taxes
on my materials waived.

620
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,160
Impressive.

621
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,320
Please, help me!

622
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,160
My sisters have been kidnapped!

623
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,520
The cart's not far.

624
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,240
We can still catch it!

625
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,760
Please, help me!

626
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,760
We have orders to head to the north.

627
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,840
We can't delay.

628
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,320
Go report it to the authorities.

629
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,120
- Please!
- Master Congyi, let's go!

630
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,480
Save them, please!

631
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,720
Kangning.

632
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,800
Kangning.

633
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,280
Someone, help me!

634
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,560
Kangning.

635
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,880
You're from the Li family?

636
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,080
Master Chai, Kangning…

637
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,960
She's been taken!

638
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,160
Please save her!

639
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,240
Fuhui…

640
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,920
She's on the cart too!

641
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,720
- What?
- Quick, where's the cart?

642
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,280
Over there! That way!

643
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,000
That's the one!

644
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,200
Deqing, take her back.

645
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,080
- Got it.
- Rest of you, follow me!

646
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,840
Sir, it's to the right.

647
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,360
Cousin.

648
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,520
Lives are at stake. Don't mess this up.

649
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,480
They've traveled far and wide with me,

650
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,080
faced countless bandits.

651
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,240
Their skills are decent.

652
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,520
No mistake. Let's go!

653
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,560
Hurry!

654
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,200
Stay here and watch them.

655
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,160
Got it.

656
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,520
Rest of you, keep this place secure.

657
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,360
Let's go.

658
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,880
Stay put!

659
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,720
Find somewhere to hide.

660
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,920
Cousin, they're all caught!

661
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,520
Spare us, sir! Spare us!

662
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,800
Mercy!

663
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,720
Bandit, where did you take my wife?

664
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,720
I only thought they looked lovely.

665
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,400
I wanted to offer them to my leader

666
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,320
or sell them to a wealthy lord,

667
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,720
but I never laid a finger on them.

668
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,800
Take her back.

669
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,520
- Please spare us!
- Yes.

670
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,640
Gag him.

671
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,760
Sir.

672
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,320
Seems to be a small band
taking shelter here.

673
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,880
Tie them up, hand them to the authorities.
We'll find their lair soon.

674
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,920
No rush.

675
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,000
Save my wife first and we'll talk later.

676
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,600
If your wife asks later

677
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,640
why you didn't guard her,

678
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,720
knowing there were bandits,
what will you say?

679
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,760
And if she asks

680
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,520
why you abandoned your ledger

681
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,760
to drink at Pan Restaurant
the moment she left,

682
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,320
what will your excuse be?

683
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,400
Instead of gratitude,

684
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,400
you'll get blamed.

685
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,760
If you want to live at her mercy forever,

686
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,840
then go ahead.

687
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,360
Kangning, listen to me.

688
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,320
If we can escape, it's a blessing.

689
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,920
If we can't,

690
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,360
don't throw your life away.

691
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,240
Do whatever they demand.

692
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,920
Gold and jewels mean nothing.

693
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,680
Even chastity is meaningless.

694
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,000
Our lives are what matter.

695
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,640
Only then can we return to Mother.

696
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,880
That's the wife I know.

697
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,520
If it comes to the worst,

698
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,840
I only want her alive.

699
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,880
No matter where she's sold,

700
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,360
I'll find her.

701
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,880
Fuhui is wise and resolute.

702
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,720
Not one to be swayed easily.
Are you still trying to scare her?

703
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,160
Of course, I am.

704
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,560
If she had obeyed,
she wouldn't be suffering like this.

705
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,000
An obedient wife is the best wife.

706
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,040
Then you'd better steel yourself.

707
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,520
If you regret halfway…

708
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,560
Don't worry, brother.

709
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,960
I swear, no regrets.

710
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,480
I've heard that a thousand times.

711
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,080
- Remember.
- Got it, brother.

712
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,480
I'll never tell, no matter what.

713
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,040
Come here.

714
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,560
Don't move!

715
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,400
Mr. Zhang, outside Guangli Gate,

716
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,640
offered 200 strings.

717
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,560
He wants a young and pretty one.

718
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,560
Follow my plan.

719
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,800
Send her tonight. No delays.

720
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,480
Great. Better we split it for drinks

721
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,440
than give it to the boss.

722
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,320
But 200 strings is too little.

723
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,920
This work risks our heads.

724
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,680
We should extort more from him.

725
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,240
Don't talk nonsense.

726
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,160
No drinking or sleeping tonight.

727
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,320
Keep your eyes open.

728
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,600
Watch this woman closely.

729
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,840
So we can explain to our superiors.

730
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,640
There's one more thing.

731
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,560
The boss hasn't picked yet.

732
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,480
Don't you dare touch her first.

733
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,920
Get up!

734
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,880
Move!

735
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,560
Make another sound

736
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,160
and I'll toss you down the cliff.

737
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,160
I haven't run.

738
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,600
I'm doing as told.

739
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,920
Why torment me?

740
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,360
I've been frail since I was young.

741
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,040
If I die on the way,

742
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,480
wouldn't your efforts be wasted?

743
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,640
Behave and listen.

744
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,880
Once the deal's done, we part ways.

745
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,560
I overheard in the bag.

746
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,680
How much are you selling me for?

747
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,600
That's right. Two hundred strings.

748
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,520
I can brew tea and light incense.

749
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,520
Even sold for thousands, it's fair.

750
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,120
But for just a few strings?

751
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,480
Isn't that an insult?

752
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,200
You're from nowhere.

753
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,400
Easy to explain, hard to hear.

754
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,240
Let me be honest.

755
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,720
I'm the third daughter of the Li family
from Sifu House on Pan Street.

756
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,640
Across from us is Master Chai,
the new owner of Pan Restaurant.

757
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,960
He's ruthless and shameless.

758
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,640
I despise him
for ruining my family's business.

759
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,640
So, I tricked him out of a fortune

760
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,760
and hid it somewhere safe.
I've kept it hidden ever since.

761
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,280
If you spare me,

762
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:52,000
I'll give you 380 strings

763
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,320
for my freedom.

764
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,800
Are you just stalling to escape?

765
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,840
Why would you think that?

766
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,600
I knew you'd doubt me.

767
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,720
That's why I didn't speak until now.

768
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,560
Master Chai is furious over his loss.

769
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,000
He even smashed his prized jade comb.

770
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,680
He's been seeking someone to repair it.

771
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,200
How could that be a trick?

772
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,240
And look around.

773
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,440
This place is deserted.

774
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,480
I could scream and no one would come.

775
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,240
How dare I lie to you?

776
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,560
A headless ghost would be my fate.

777
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,360
Then tell me where it's hidden.

778
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,760
I'll send someone to fetch it.

779
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,680
Come closer, I'll tell you.

780
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,000
Closer.

781
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,920
Kangning, it's me.

782
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,960
- You deserve this--
- Ruthless and shameless one.

783
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Enough already?

784
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,000
Aren't you just toying with me,

785
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,400
you scoundrel?

786
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,720
So,

787
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,080
you can mess with me,

788
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,400
hit me, scold me,

789
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,040
but I can't tease you back?

790
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,040
When did you figure it out?

791
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,280
What kidnapper uses Four Harmonies?

792
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,760
- And Fuhui?
- Guarded safely by her husband.

793
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,600
He even asked me to keep it secret.

794
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,600
So he can play the hero later.

795
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,000
Come. Let's get you home.

796
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,440
Hold tight. We're heading back.

797
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,720
Here we are, right up ahead.

798
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,720
Okay.

799
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,160
Take care, sir.

800
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,800
Thanks for your patronage.
Hire from me again!

801
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,920
Safe delivery guaranteed.

802
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,720
<i>Not good.</i>

803
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,080
<i>If someone sees me</i>
<i>walking with a man at night,</i>

804
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,200
<i>there'll be plenty of gossip.</i>

805
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,440
Mr. Zhang, this job's not done yet.

806
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,280
We'll need another trip in a few days.

807
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,760
I'll count on you.

808
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,200
No problem.

809
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,720
Isn't that Master Chai?

810
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,160
The owner of Pan Restaurant, Master Chai?

811
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,280
I haven't greeted you in a while.

812
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,120
When free,

813
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,440
visit my shop sometime.

814
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,880
Been too busy lately.

815
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,080
I'll come by another day.

816
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,080
I'm rushing to send a maid for service.

817
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,120
Don't want to miss the hour
or ruin my mother's banquet.

818
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,440
I must go ahead. We'll talk another day.

819
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,560
Alright, Master Chai, take care.

820
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,400
A maid?

821
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,560
Kangning.

822
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,680
I didn't do this to tease you.

823
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,560
Not for any other reason, just because…

824
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,640
I wanted to spend more time with you.

825
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,160
I'll be going.

826
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,960
Hold on.

827
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,840
If your sisters return, all's well.

828
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,000
If not,

829
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,640
I'll act like you two never existed.

830
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,560
Mother!

831
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,080
I was wrong!

832
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,440
I'll never play around again,

833
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,880
Mother.

834
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,080
You're wrong, Mother.

835
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,720
Even if we were there,

836
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,440
we'd just be tied up too.

837
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,640
It's the bandits' fault, not ours.

838
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,720
Why blame us?

839
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,040
Mother's just angry.

840
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,640
If they don't return,

841
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,840
I'll give my life for theirs.

842
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,200
You still won't admit your fault?

843
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,760
- You're to blame!
- Mother!

844
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,560
I'm older than Leshan.

845
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,600
Don't punish her alone. I'll take half.

846
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,880
Mother.

847
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,080
They're already missing. Don't hit them.

848
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,120
What have I done to deserve this?

849
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,720
My two daughters.

850
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,000
How am I supposed to go on?

851
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,720
Madam, they're back!

852
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,960
They're back!

853
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,240
Mother!

854
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,200
- Kangning!
- Kangning!

855
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,560
Mother!

856
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,080
Kangning!

857
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,520
I'm home.

858
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,880
- Kangning!
- It's alright now.

859
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,640
Kangning!

860
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,040
I'm back.

861
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,520
Good. It's okay.

862
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,880
It's fine now. All fine.

863
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,120
Don't cry.

864
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,440
As long as you're back.

865
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,920
You scared me.

866
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,320
It's over now.

867
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,800
Quickly!

868
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,560
No!

869
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,160
Come here. Come!

870
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,680
Hit me once.

871
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,840
Hit me!

872
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,720
Hurry!

873
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,800
Harder!

874
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,080
Give me a good punch.

875
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,760
Good punch!

876
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,160
My lady, I've come to save you!

877
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,840
Careful!

878
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,080
Don't be afraid.

879
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,000
I'm here.

880
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,840
Are you alright, my lady?

881
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,120
Are you hurt?

882
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,560
Were you frightened?

883
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,360
My lady?

884
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,240
My lady.

885
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,560
Why did you come so late?

886
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,600
Don't be afraid, my lady.

887
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,720
It's all my fault. I came too late.

888
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,920
Don't be scared.

889
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,080
