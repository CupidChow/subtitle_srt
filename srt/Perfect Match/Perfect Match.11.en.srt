00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,320
EPISODE 11

2
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,680
The top scholar is parading
in the streets!

3
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,880
Here comes the top scholar!

4
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,360
Has he arrived?

5
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,480
He's here.

6
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,880
He's truly handsome.

7
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,240
He's such an elegant young man.

8
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,240
ORDER

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,080
The third-ranked scholar
this year is quite impressive.

10
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,920
I wonder if he's married.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Here they come!

12
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,400
Such a young and handsome
talent is probably already taken.

13
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,040
Such big luck
definitely won't fall onto your family.

14
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,400
I was just joking.

15
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,760
Why is there congestion up ahead?

16
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,160
The Jinshis are heading
to the scholarly assembly.

17
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,920
The common folks have come
to watch the fun.

18
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,200
He is so attractive.

19
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,960
Take my flower!

20
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,320
I'm so envious.

21
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
It's such a bliss to be able to marry him.

22
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,000
Mind the threshold as you step over.

23
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,000
The bride is coming out.

24
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,920
I'm so envious of her.

25
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,680
Mother-in-law.

26
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,120
My good son-in-law.

27
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,720
Come on. Please rise.

28
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,040
Come on.

29
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,560
- Come on.
- They must be happy.

30
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,400
The auspicious time has come.

31
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,120
Rise the sedan chair.

32
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,400
- What's wrong?
- Madam Li.

33
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,440
Well… The wedding bounty.

34
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,840
I almost forgot the wedding bounty.
There's money for everyone.

35
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,480
- There's money for everyone.
- Come on.

36
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,480
Lift the sedan chair!

37
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,000
Madam Li, you must be very happy

38
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,280
to have a third-ranked scholar
as a son-in-law.

39
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,400
That's right. It's said that you found him

40
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,600
on the street.

41
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,680
Stop the nonsense.

42
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,560
There are many beggars
and starved corpses in the snow.

43
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,640
To just get
a third-place scholar from there?

44
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,320
It's all fate.

45
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,640
Let's go.

46
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,240
Madam Li seldom saves people.

47
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,520
But when she did,
it has brought immense blessings.

48
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,320
They're so talkative.

49
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,640
Let's go.

50
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,800
- We mustn't go easy on him.
- That's right.

51
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,040
Fellow scholars.

52
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,840
For my sake, please spare the groom.

53
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,920
No way.

54
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,280
He is so lucky that he got married shortly
after he became the third-ranked scholar.

55
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,160
- We won't let him off.
- Exactly.

56
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,080
Sang the Stone,
we're looking for the groom.

57
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,480
What's it to you?

58
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,120
You want to drink, right?

59
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,240
I'll drink with you.

60
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,520
I'll also compose poetry
with you to the break of dawn.

61
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,680
Fellow scholars, let's go.

62
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,920
You'll accompany us? Alright.

63
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,880
Let's go.

64
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,360
We wanted to drink with the groom.

65
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,440
Mother, I'm here to pay you respects.

66
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,400
Please have some tea.

67
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,320
Shouhua, we are a humble household.

68
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,240
There is no need for formalities.

69
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Get up now.

70
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,920
Yes.

71
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,880
Yangxi got ready early in the morning

72
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,280
and went to Xingguo Temple.

73
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,320
I heard him say
he's to attend some meeting.

74
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,120
According to tradition,

75
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,520
all the Jinshi of this year

76
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,000
must attend the scholarly assembly
at Xingguo Temple's

77
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,520
East Depositary of Sutras.

78
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,760
Yes, it's the scholarly assembly.

79
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,680
It would be fine if it were someone else.

80
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,080
But the top three scholars
have to stay within the bureau's lodging

81
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,960
and aren't easily allowed
to stay elsewhere.

82
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,280
You just got married yesterday.

83
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,440
It must be hard on you.

84
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,120
Has he apologized to you?

85
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,440
Yes.

86
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,840
He has already explained.

87
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,280
Okay.

88
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,680
Okay.

89
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,400
Mother, please let me help you.

90
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,160
You know how to spin yarn as well?

91
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,760
I am slow, but I can learn it.

92
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,280
When I don't understand something,

93
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,080
I'll ask you to teach me.

94
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,600
Okay. Come here.

95
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,400
That ungrateful, shameless,

96
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,400
and wretched scoundrel!

97
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,160
How dare he mistreat my daughter?

98
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,400
We should go to Xingguo Temple,
drag him out,

99
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,240
and give him two big slaps.

100
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,800
Mother is right.

101
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,440
Passing the imperial exams is important,
but so is getting married.

102
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,800
There's no such thing
for a bride to return home

103
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,600
three days after her wedding
without the groom.

104
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,360
This is a slap in the face to our family.

105
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,920
You may not know this.

106
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,480
The scholarly assembly is also called
the bureau of top scholars.

107
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,120
The Jinshis enter in March
and give thanks to His Majesty in April.

108
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,400
In May, they'll have to pay tribute
to first-class Jinshis

109
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,960
and get to know their fellow scholars.

110
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,240
As for paying respects
to the sages and teachers,

111
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,440
His Majesty bestowing a joy banquet,

112
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,440
making name inscriptions, and so forth,
they all require an auspicious date.

113
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,120
All these festivities
will take up two months' time.

114
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,120
Mother, Yangxi cannot get away.

115
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,520
Please let me apologize on his behalf.

116
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,480
Mother, calm down.

117
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,720
Sit down.

118
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,080
Alright.

119
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,200
Just sit down.

120
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,880
Shouhua,

121
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,640
now that it has turned out like this,
don't cover up for him anymore.

122
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,840
Chunlai has already told us all
about what happened on the wedding night.

123
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,360
Chunlai, I told you to be quiet.

124
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,960
Then you should have sewn up her mouth.

125
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,280
Mother has prepared such a feast,

126
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,400
and we have been eagerly waiting
with hot food.

127
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,440
But your husband hasn't shown up till now.

128
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,880
You can't just hide it.

129
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,600
He is now the third-ranked scholar.

130
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,200
He must feel high above.

131
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,640
If it weren't for our family
finding him, taking him in,

132
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,640
pouring dose after dose
of good medicine into him,

133
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,160
and nourishing him with pork and chicken,
he'd have long become a starved corpse.

134
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,120
Shouhua, you are just too kind-hearted.

135
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,400
If it were me,

136
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,280
I'd rather turn my face
and make a big fuss

137
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,240
to ruin his so-called good name.

138
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,360
Sisters, calm your anger.

139
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,520
It's all my fault.

140
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,920
The Du family proposed marriage
to me, the third daughter.

141
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,200
But it was Shouhua,
the eldest daughter, who got married.

142
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,040
Du Yangxi has a proud nature.

143
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,680
I presume he resents us
for the matchmaking gone wrong

144
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,880
and takes it out on Shouhua.

145
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,880
So what if the bride was changed?

146
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,640
It was his own mother
who agreed to it in person.

147
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,320
I didn't bully him or deceive him.

148
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,640
If he disapproved,
he should have done something earlier.

149
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,040
Shouhua, it's totally up to you now.

150
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,520
If you want to seek justice,
we'll go to their door right away.

151
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,680
He's dishonest.
We should confront his mother.

152
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,880
Exactly.

153
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,800
Let's ask her why her son
has to insult us like this.

154
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,440
Listening to the maid's
overstatement of the issue,

155
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,000
you want to seek retribution.

156
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,080
This is making a mountain
out of a molehill.

157
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,920
Since I chose to marry him,

158
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,920
I can bear this bit of grievance.

159
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,120
Just be at ease.

160
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,240
I'll deal with him slowly in the future.

161
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,560
Shouhua, don't be hard on yourself.

162
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,840
Do you really have a plan?

163
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,920
Rest assured.

164
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,880
Shouhua.

165
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,720
Shouhua.

166
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,920
Kangning,

167
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,600
between sisters,
words of apology are not necessary.

168
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,360
I feel aggrieved for you.

169
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,760
Kangning,

170
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,720
with books, a zither, flowers,
and a small courtyard,

171
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,840
I'll be content for the rest of my life.

172
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,080
If it weren't for Mother and you sisters,
the place by the statue of Buddha

173
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,160
in a mountain temple
would be my final refuge.

174
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,320
I do not covet worldly love.

175
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,120
If my husband can grant me some respect,

176
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,560
I will respect him in return
and live my days peacefully.

177
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,400
How I wish Father were still alive

178
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,960
and you had never married
into the Wu family.

179
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,160
That scoundrel, Du Yangxi.

180
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,120
Doesn't he know how lucky he is?

181
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,920
How dare he treat you so coldly?

182
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,800
There is no need to feel aggrieved for me.

183
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,120
I am no longer that naive little girl.

184
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,640
The worldly love?

185
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,920
I don't want it at all.

186
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,600
Kangning,

187
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,680
my heart has always been calm
and peaceful.

188
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,960
This is the best way.

189
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,200
The Du family treats you so badly,

190
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,840
and you have endured it.

191
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,440
You said you had a plan.

192
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,160
You didn't say that to deceive us,
did you?

193
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,600
It'll be several more months
before they're officially assigned.

194
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,200
Master Sang is staying here
for the time being.

195
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,080
The clothes and bedding in the west
chamber need to be sun dried regularly.

196
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,440
Later, go ask Lingyao

197
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,320
if Master Sang
has any dietary restrictions.

198
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,200
Have you got it?

199
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,480
Yes.

200
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,200
Stay calm.

201
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,080
I will be staying here for a long time.

202
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,960
I plan to first change the furnishings
in the house.

203
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,120
Be careful, my lady.

204
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,080
Pay close attention.

205
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,200
Don't let it be damaged.

206
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,040
Don't worry, my lady. That won't happen.

207
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,560
Young master, slow down a bit.

208
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,040
Master Du has returned.

209
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,720
Slow down.

210
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,680
Lift up your foot. Lift it.

211
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,120
We're almost there.

212
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,320
My lady,

213
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,800
Master Du was invited by some old friends.

214
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,480
Master Sang is drunk.

215
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,240
So, Master Du ordered me
to take him back first.

216
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,240
He…

217
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,440
- Quickly help him inside.
- Okay.

218
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,440
Chunlai, go summon a physician quickly.

219
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,560
Okay.

220
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,080
- Yuanming, come this way.
- Yuanming, welcome.

221
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,200
Have a seat.

222
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,880
Come on. Have a seat.

223
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,680
This is not appropriate.

224
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,920
Yuanming, before you became
the third-ranked scholar,

225
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,480
I had never slighted you in the least.

226
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,280
Otherwise, I wouldn't
invite you over today.

227
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,360
Look. You're married to Shouhua,

228
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,040
and I have taken Kangning as my wife.

229
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,640
Our close friendship is enriched
by our connection as in-laws.

230
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,440
As your brother-in-law,
I want to treat you to a drink.

231
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,960
Are you really going to reject me?

232
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,200
Exactly. Just sit down.

233
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,800
The Pan Restaurant's released a wine.

234
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,480
Please rest assured and enjoy a few cups.

235
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,120
Maybe you can write us something.
We've decided on the wine's name.

236
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,080
"Inquiring the Third-Ranked Scholar".
What do you think? Isn't it clever?

237
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,920
Yes, it is.

238
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,320
But I have to attend
the scholarly assembly.

239
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,600
I can't risk
making my fellow scholars wait for me.

240
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,040
Please excuse me.

241
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,160
Sit down.

242
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
I'm going to be frank with you.

243
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,240
I didn't invite you for a drink today.

244
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,120
I had anticipated this.

245
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,920
You two are acting as intermediaries

246
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,320
for Li Shouhua, right?

247
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,320
Since you know the situation, just agree
to it and spare us the extra talking.

248
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,640
I can understand why Fan is doing this.

249
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,880
But Chai, how come

250
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,600
a dignified man like you
would also be so terrified of his wife,

251
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,160
that you want to mediate?

252
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,320
What do you mean?

253
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,840
Am I not bright or great enough?

254
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,840
How am I not a dignified man?

255
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,000
- Kangning, my darling.
- Get out.

256
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,200
Kangning. Kangning.

257
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,800
Let me explain.

258
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,560
This is all your fault
for making my elder sister unhappy.

259
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,000
Don't expect things to go your way.

260
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,440
Kangning, listen to my explanation.

261
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,560
Go sleep somewhere else.

262
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,840
Kangning?

263
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,760
Kangning?

264
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
What are you laughing at?

265
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,560
Yuanming.

266
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,520
I too am a newlywed.

267
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,880
How can you bear to implicate me
and let me get cold-shouldered every day?

268
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,600
It's because the Li family
doesn't keep their promises.

269
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,520
Chai, I'm not blaming you.

270
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,840
If the Li family wanted
to marry Kangning to you,

271
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,440
they could have just told me the truth.

272
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,080
I wouldn't insist on marrying her.

273
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,760
Yet the Li family couldn't bear
to lose either you, a wealthy man,

274
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,320
or me, a Jinshi, as their sons-in-law.

275
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,800
They talked my mother into agreeing
to this scheme of substitution,

276
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,680
wishing that all of Bianjing's
fine young men would be theirs.

277
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,800
- How can I not be annoyed?
- Yes, you are right.

278
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,320
As a parent,
Madam Li did have her own plans

279
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,640
and has wronged you.

280
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,400
But Shouhua has never offended you
enough to deserve this humiliation.

281
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,840
Indeed.

282
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,960
Back then, Shouhua had a reputation
in Luoyang for her character and beauty

283
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,480
and was sought after by many.

284
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,320
How about you go meet her first?

285
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,520
As an old saying goes, nothing
forcibly done is going to be agreeable.

286
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,720
Even if she's a celestial maiden
descended to earth,

287
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,480
my heart remains as unmoved as a rock.

288
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,360
- Tie him up.
- What are you doing?

289
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,600
- Get up.
- What are you doing?

290
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,880
How dare you touch me?

291
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,080
- Deqing.
- Coming.

292
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,600
- Quick. Get him up.
- Stop.

293
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,640
- Move.
- Listen to me.

294
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,840
- What you are doing is…
- Move.

295
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,160
- Move.
- This is not proper.

296
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,360
Can't you see where you are?

297
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,200
And you're telling me
it's not proper? Move.

298
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,560
Before dawn tomorrow,
don't let Master Du come out,

299
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,920
- even if he climbs the wall.
- Understood.

300
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,640
Mother, I'm back.

301
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,040
It's me who chose your wife for you.

302
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,760
I find her good in every way.

303
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,320
If you are not satisfied,
you can just blame me.

304
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,920
You absolutely shouldn't

305
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,760
have cold-shouldered your wife.

306
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,560
If you dare not return again,
don't even bother to come home again.

307
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,440
Go see your wife first.

308
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,280
Yes, Mother.

309
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,760
It was actually her painting.

310
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,320
It turns out I underestimated her.

311
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,120
<i>CLOUDS CONNECT TO VAST WU GORGE AFAR</i>
<i>MOONLIGHT TURNS SNOWY PEAKS COLD WHITE</i>

312
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,920
<i>ANCIENT CYPRESS ODE</i>
<i>TALL CYPRESSES STAND FIRM AND OLD</i>

313
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,400
I told you not to be so honest.

314
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,120
When other people toasted,
you simply drank

315
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,360
all the wine coming your way.

316
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,320
Now you know
how uncomfortable it is, right?

317
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,240
It's all because of you, Du the Eel.

318
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,280
You were so slippery and hard to grasp.

319
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,760
So, they all came at me.

320
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,680
You stubborn stone.

321
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,280
If it weren't for your words

322
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,760
to be too blunt in front of His Majesty
in Chongzheng Hall,

323
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,560
your ranking wouldn't have dropped
from first to sixth all of a sudden.

324
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,640
To not dismiss you on the spot
is already an act of mercy of His Majesty.

325
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,280
I will go heat some water.

326
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,720
Andao,

327
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,160
when did you secretly marry a wife?

328
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,200
Everything here is meticulously arranged.

329
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,840
It makes me, an outsider,
have no place to exert my efforts.

330
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,120
She is indeed a very good wife.

331
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,040
Master, you have returned.

332
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,880
Mother learned that Master Sang
got sick from drinking.

333
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,360
So, she instructed me
to bring over hangover soup.

334
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,080
Please sober up before you eat.

335
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,840
The food after a hangover
shouldn't worsen it.

336
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,720
I dared not prepare wine and meat
for lunch.

337
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,000
There's only plain porridge
and a couple of side dishes.

338
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,280
It's all simple, home-cooked food.
Master Sang, please have some.

339
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,320
If you need anything else, just tell me.

340
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,960
Thank you.
Thank my godmother on my behalf.

341
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,000
I-Is she my wife?

342
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,680
She is not my wife anyway.

343
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,320
Did my wife make this?

344
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,520
How would I know?

345
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,080
I am just like you, spending every day
at the scholarly assembly.

346
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,920
How would I know if she cooked this?

347
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,520
The clothes on you

348
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,000
and the boots on your feet are all new.

349
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,920
They must have been prepared
by my wife as well.

350
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
It cannot be wrong.

351
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,880
My mother is blind and can't do that.

352
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,000
The things in this room
must have been prepared by my wife.

353
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,720
I, as her husband,
haven't enjoyed any of it.

354
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,040
But you, my sworn brother,
have taken all the benefit.

355
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,280
Sang the Stone,
so I married my wife for your sake?

356
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,920
Oh, heavens!

357
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,680
Someone has a home
but doesn't wish to return,

358
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,360
having fun
at the scholarly assembly every day.

359
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,200
Yet I have no home to return to,

360
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,520
suffering greatly
among a pile of men every day.

361
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,160
Heavens, you are so unjust.

362
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,360
How can you blame me for that?

363
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,840
When have you ever seen
a stubborn stone bloom?

364
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,480
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

365
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,840
If you show off to me again,
I'll hit you every time I see you.

366
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,760
Sang the Stone.

367
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,760
Sang the Stone?

368
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,160
Open the door.

369
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,680
Sang the Stone?

370
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,000
Sang Andao.

371
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,000
Since when does a guest
take over the host's role?

372
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,240
Open the door.

373
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,720
I'm still hungry.

374
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,440
Open the door.

375
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,040
Did you hear me?

376
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,040
Open the door.

377
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,080
Master Du must not have eaten yet.

378
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,880
Go check in the kitchen.

379
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,000
Yes.

380
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,320
He can starve.

381
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,360
I will remember your teachings, Mother.

382
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,560
I'll go back and apologize to her now.

383
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,520
When others paint the jade rain flowers,
they emphasize their delicate beauty.

384
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,640
With these few strokes of yours,

385
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,840
you've captured
their soft yet resilient beauty.

386
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,240
The painting shows the spirit
of a recluse in the mountains,

387
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,600
which is extraordinary,

388
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,520
living up to the flower name
of "the indifferent being".

389
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,840
Please forgive me, Master.
The mistress did not allow food storage.

390
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,920
There's not much left to eat
in the kitchen.

391
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,200
Please bear with it.

392
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,280
I will go to make a fire
and cook right away.

393
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,640
It's just…

394
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,680
that the firewood delivered today
is all damp.

395
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,000
The smoke will be very thick.

396
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,960
I'm afraid the fire won't be started
by midnight.

397
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,880
Don't bother.

398
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,720
Attending banquets
has made me bored of it.

399
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,760
I just love eating this.

400
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,480
It's light.

401
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,160
And it's still hot.

402
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,800
It's delicious.

403
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,440
It's late at night.

404
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,720
You must be tired
from attending banquets these days.

405
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,960
You should rest earlier.

406
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,000
Master, the bed is ready.

407
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,440
You should rest early.

408
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,640
Shouhua?

409
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,000
Shouhua?

410
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,200
Shouhua. Shou…

411
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,920
Shouhua, it has been hard
on you these past few days.

412
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,360
I have some heartfelt words
I want to say to you.

413
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,080
Shouhua, are you alright?

414
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,720
Chunlai. Chunlai.

415
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,640
What do you want, Shouhua?

416
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,160
I can do it for you.

417
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,480
I wouldn't dare trouble you.

418
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,120
Chunlai. Chunlai.

419
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,480
I'm coming.

420
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,520
It's cold at night.
I know you tend to cough at night.

421
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,240
I've prepared the radish juice already.

422
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,280
My lady, you've had this odd condition
since you were young.

423
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,920
You're generally fine during the day,

424
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,600
but you suffer from chest congestion
and coughing when night falls.

425
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,280
Medication doesn't seem to help.

426
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,160
Each year, only after this season passes
do you get relief.

427
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,520
I'm afraid tonight
will be hard for you too.

428
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,720
I'm worried
I'll disturb your rest, Master.

429
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,040
Shouhua. Shouhua. Shouhua, you…

430
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,280
Master, you'll have to thank
His Majesty at court.

431
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,040
It will be bad if you get sick too.

432
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,520
You'd better go to the east chamber

433
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,520
and share the room with Master Sang.

434
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,440
Yuanming…

435
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,400
What, Yuanming?

436
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,440
Upon seeing your wife in person,
your worldly desires are stirred?

437
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,920
Chai…

438
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,080
speaking of the love for beauty,
everyone has it.

439
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,920
But my wife's beauty
lies not in her appearance

440
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,280
but in the elegance of her soul.

441
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,720
Before I saw her in person,
I saw her writing.

442
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,360
She emulated my handwriting,

443
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,840
yet she transformed it completely,
turning iron into gold.

444
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,200
When I am not at home,
she shows filial piety to my mother

445
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,640
and takes good care of my friend
without a single complaint.

446
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,400
Such forbearance and grace
are indeed rare in this world.

447
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,600
I have been narrow-minded.

448
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,040
I owe her an apology.

449
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,120
But if I've grievously offended her,

450
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,960
I don't know how to apologize to her.

451
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,680
Du,

452
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,480
I advise you
to kowtow to her in apology at once.

453
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,840
We kneel to heaven, earth,
and our parents.

454
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,920
How could I kneel to my wife?

455
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,640
If this gets out in the future,

456
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,360
how am I supposed to face the people

457
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,120
if I were to become an official?

458
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,680
Kneeling might be easy,

459
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,880
but standing back up afterwards
might prove difficult.

460
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,440
But my cousin--

461
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,760
So, Yuanming,

462
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,880
you want to find a way
that satisfies both ends.

463
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,800
What do you mean by satisfying both ends?

464
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,720
It means you want both the beauty
and your dignity.

465
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,600
Wanting both the beauty and my dignity?

466
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,480
Please enlighten me, Chai.

467
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,080
I heard from my wife

468
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,160
that Shouhua is fond of literature.

469
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,400
Yuanming, have you forgotten

470
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,720
what you are best at?

471
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,520
What am I best at?

472
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,000
Shouhua.

473
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,760
Put it here.

474
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,920
No fire is allowed on Cold Food Day.

475
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,960
Mother feared the Du family
couldn't handle it.

476
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,000
She led us in preparing these all day.

477
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,720
We cooked wheat porridge,

478
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,840
steamed zitui cakes, and stewed meat.

479
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,720
You won't go hungry if
there's no fire for a few days.

480
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,560
They are frying sanzi in the kitchen now.
I will bring some to you later.

481
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,800
Have some porridge first.

482
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,200
Why have you come again?

483
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,440
I'm worried with you here.

484
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,480
My lady, Master has sent a letter.

485
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,880
Give it to me.

486
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,560
TO SHOUHUA

487
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,600
Take a look.

488
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,840
<i>The bright moon is so luminous,</i>

489
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,800
<i>shining on my gauzy bed curtains.</i>

490
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,040
<i>Anxiety prevents my sleep.</i>

491
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,680
<i>I get up and pace, holding my clothes.</i>

492
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,200
<i>Though the scholarly assembly is joyful,</i>
<i>every day I long to return home early.</i>

493
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,920
<i>I hesitate again and again.</i>

494
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,800
<i>To whom should I confide my thoughts?</i>

495
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,760
Du Yangxi knows he was wrong
and is trying to make amends to Shouhua?

496
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,640
My lady, Master is waiting for your reply.

497
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,080
He is not the only one who can write.

498
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,120
Shouhua also possesses
fine literary skills.

499
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,600
Shouhua, come on.

500
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,040
Send him a reply,

501
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,160
so that he knows

502
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,760
that there is also someone
who loves reading in our family.

503
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,040
As if we cared.
If he truly knows his mistake,

504
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,480
why doesn't he apologize in person?

505
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,800
Is his dignity worth more than others'?

506
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,840
Mother said
that he is a third-ranked scholar.

507
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,880
Even His Majesty praises him
as talented and handsome

508
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,400
and of boundless future prospects.

509
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,280
Shouhua is going
to become a high official's wife.

510
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,680
What's wrong with giving way once?

511
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,320
A lady can be magnanimous as well.

512
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,360
What does this mean?

513
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,760
Lingyao?

514
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,640
I get it. Look.

515
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,720
- What is this?
- What else? It's a blank piece of paper.

516
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,040
You're wrong. Yuanming is here,
mourning the bright moon,

517
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,840
while Shouhua is home,
weeping like the rain.

518
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,320
Yuanming asks,
"To whom should I confide my thoughts?"

519
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,640
What will Shouhua reply?

520
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,080
Shouhua replies, "Deep affection
is spoken without words."

521
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,680
Isn't this just right?

522
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,640
Does she really mean this?

523
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,360
Alright, she does.

524
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,120
Chai, having read thousands of books,

525
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,360
I'm afraid it's still hard
to understand a woman's heart.

526
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,760
She wants to say, "Deep affection
is spoken without words."

527
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,040
She didn't write a single word?

528
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,040
Yes. Doesn't this correspond
to your letter perfectly?

529
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,880
<i>Under the green gauze window,</i>
<i>I opened your letter.</i>

530
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,680
<i>All I saw was a piece of blank paper.</i>

531
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,360
<i>I suppose you have no other intentions</i>

532
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,720
<i>but to tell me</i>
<i>about your unspoken longing.</i>

533
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,360
Alright.

534
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,400
Legend has it

535
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,440
that once upon a time in Fuzhou,
there was a scholar

536
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,920
who wrote a letter
to his wife far away in his hometown.

537
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,440
He accidentally placed blank paper
into the envelope.

538
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,320
As a result, it brought forth a letter

539
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,880
in reply with endless affection.

540
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,240
Now, I'm following this example.

541
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,240
I hope she can also
understand my feelings.

542
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,640
The profound affection is so touching.

543
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,680
Lingyao.

544
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,200
Yes?

545
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,360
Send this letter quickly.

546
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,280
Okay.

547
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,960
Yuanming, once Shouhua sees this letter,

548
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,880
you'll be able
to enter the bedroom tonight.

549
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,720
Then I must thank you, Chai.

550
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,160
You are welcome.

551
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,480
Chai, you've misled me.

552
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,640
Chunlai,

553
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,760
go to the west chamber and invite Sang
to dine with us.

554
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,800
Okay.

555
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,400
Godmother.

556
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,720
No need for formalities. Just sit.

557
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,000
Before you passed the exams,
you two shared everything,

558
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,760
be it a quilt, robe, or pancake.

559
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,280
That is what sworn brothers
and close friends in adversity are.

560
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,080
Later, when you become officials,

561
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,960
you should also be of the same branch

562
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,520
and exchange what you learn.

563
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,520
From now on, don't have meals
in your own room.

564
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,080
Come out and eat with us.

565
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,520
I told you long ago,
but you've been a stickler for tradition.

566
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,800
Now that Mother has spoken,
you should listen to her.

567
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,480
Okay, I will listen to you.

568
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,360
Shouhua, you got up early
to prepare the meal.

569
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,160
Thank you.

570
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,000
Here.

571
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,320
Here, Mother.

572
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,000
The stove won't be lit
for the next three days.

573
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,880
If you want to eat something,
just tell Chunlai to buy it.

574
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,840
The Wang's Eatery's cheesecake

575
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,280
and frozen ginger and black bean dish
are both very good.

576
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,120
Then, let's not light the stove
in the mornings anymore.

577
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,680
That way, we can save on firewood
and save you the trouble.

578
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,000
Thank you. I'll do it myself.

579
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,000
It's a few days before
you're appointed officials, right?

580
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,480
Yes, we'll be officially appointed
around June.

581
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,680
Why have you drunk so much?

582
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,720
I haven't drunk much.

583
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,720
You clearly have.

584
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,720
Don't talk.

585
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,840
Slow down.

586
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,120
Slowly.

587
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,080
Take a seat.

588
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,520
Sit, master.

589
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,720
CLOUDS HIDDEN

590
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,320
Why did the top two scholars
come to compete in poetry?

591
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,160
And when they lost,

592
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,520
they forced the winner to drink.

593
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,840
Obviously, they couldn't sit tight
when seeing

594
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,320
that you're favored by His Majesty.

595
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,880
A little jealousy is common to all.

596
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,360
Now that I've helped them vent the anger,

597
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,480
we will still be close fellow scholars

598
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,440
who can help each other out

599
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,040
after we are granted official posts.

600
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,520
This is the officialdom.

601
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,600
Have you finished the task I gave you?

602
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,280
Master, the set of ancient books
you ordered to sell

603
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,640
has been intercepted by the lady.

604
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,440
The lady says,

605
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,000
although the scholarly assembly's expenses
come from His Majesty,

606
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,600
the participants have to subsidize too.

607
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,920
Per tradition,
the top three scholars of the first class

608
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,200
need to put out the most money.

609
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,480
Jinshis from other regions
don't know the rules

610
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,920
and often make jokes of themselves.

611
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,880
The lady has already
prepared the money for you.

612
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,760
And the hangover medicine as well.

613
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,200
Here.

614
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,880
Prepare some tea.

615
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,600
Du can compose poetry
among talks and laughter

616
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,800
and answer fluently.

617
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,440
Not only His Majesty favors him.

618
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,800
Even Minister Yu personally
invited him to share a carriage.

619
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,680
It is said that Minister Lu
also asked about his marriage

620
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,760
and intended
to betroth his grandniece to him.

621
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,720
His future official career
is far beyond our reach.

622
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,800
He possesses both character
and literary talent.

623
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,120
It's a pity that he's too impetuous.

624
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,400
He's got engaged
before even passing the exams.

625
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,640
Who knew he would marry a daughter
from a tea house?

626
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,840
- A tea-selling family?
- Yes.

627
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,160
It's such pity.

628
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,680
Who is here making groundless comments
and spouting nonsense?

629
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,960
Has the way of the sages
taught you to gossip about others

630
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,280
behind their backs?

631
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,560
You spoke out of justice. Thank you.

632
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,880
Your righteousness is admirable.

633
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,320
You're welcome.

634
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,960
I am Yan Zimei from Luoyang.

635
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,320
Those two men
were speaking nonsense just now,

636
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,360
and that was indecorous.

637
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,520
That prompted me to rashly rebuke them.

638
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,040
Master Du, no need to thank me.

639
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,200
Please.

640
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,440
Please.

641
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,280
What did you say?

642
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,200
I noticed that he was elegant in speech,

643
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,560
free and easy in his temperament,
and chivalrous,

644
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,280
so I wanted to make friends with him.

645
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,760
I didn't expect him to get drunk

646
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,360
and speak of a strange matter.

647
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,160
Slow down.

648
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,640
Yan, you said
you would take drinks for me.

649
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,360
But it turns out you're a lightweight too.

650
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,600
I'm embarrassed.

651
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,840
Yan,

652
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,320
one who appreciates beauty
will admire the young and promising.

653
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,640
It's only human nature.

654
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,920
Though you and I have met by chance,
we hit it off right away

655
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,600
and find much in common.

656
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,280
There's no need to be secretive about it.

657
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,240
Are you afraid I'll laugh at you?

658
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,440
I see you as a bosom friend
from another life.

659
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,800
I'm sorry we didn't meet sooner.

660
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,120
Alright.

661
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,440
Then I won't hide it from you any longer.

662
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,360
This handkerchief
was a gift from a beloved one in the past.

663
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,280
I bare not part with it for a moment.

664
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,440
She and I pledged ourselves in secret
and vowed to grow old together.

665
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,560
But my father was strict
and resolutely disapproved,

666
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,680
so we parted ways, breaking my heart.

667
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,800
Later, she married some other man
and became a widow early on.

668
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,040
Then she followed her family to Bianjing.

669
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,960
Besides taking the exams,
I came here to find her as well.

670
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,280
You have a wide circle of friends.

671
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,960
I wanted to ask you to inquire for me.

672
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:53,040
So, Yan,
which family are you asking about?

673
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,240
He said it's the Li family

674
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,320
at the foot of Phoenix Mountain
in Luoyang.

675
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,080
That family has five daughters.

676
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,840
The eldest is the one he's looking for.

677
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,080
It's absolutely impossible.

678
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,440
Stay calm and don't be hasty.

679
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,280
Fuhui got married
and came to Bianjing for you.

680
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,360
You don't know the background
of the Li family well.

681
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,280
On what basis do you vouch for them?

682
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,000
Sit down.

683
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,160
Yuanming, this matter
is of great importance.

684
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,360
What do you plan to do?

685
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,560
I don't believe that man.

686
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,680
But they've approached us on their own.

687
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,120
So, I plan to counter their scheme
and discover the truth.

688
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,000
But I must state beforehand
that my wife is the one

689
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,760
to grow old together with me
until death do us part.

690
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,040
If she had an affair with some other man

691
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,360
or turned her back on her lover,

692
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,240
then she is not the one I desire.

693
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,000
You are going too far with your words.

694
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,800
Even for the most perfect couple,
all ends when one dies.

695
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,600
No such thing
as never parting, even in death.

696
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,560
For husband and wife,

697
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,400
when the wife passes,
the husband should not live alone either.

698
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,400
This is what true love is.

699
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,240
If either party of a couple
can easily let go, abandon, or discard,

700
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,360
they shouldn't
have become a couple at first.

701
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,240
Cousin…

702
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:14,000
what Shouhua wants
is a spouse to share life with.

703
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,440
How come she ends up with him?

704
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,280
I think this is going to be bad.

705
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,080
Gentlemen…

706
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,040
I have laid out the whole matter

707
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,600
because, firstly, some matters
aren't proper for me to handle personally.

708
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,080
I'd like to ask for your help, Chai.

709
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,920
And secondly, I would like you two
to be my witnesses,

710
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,560
in case someday,
in the future, people accuse me

711
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,080
of being ungrateful and heartless.

712
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,320
I'm just afraid

713
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,960
that you two might not be discreet

714
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,320
and let slip any information.

715
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,600
You…

716
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,880
You can investigate as you like,
but what do you take us for?

717
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,080
Even with a knife at our throats,
we would rather die than speak.

718
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,080
He is right.

719
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,520
If those women can band together,

720
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,400
why can't we
also form a sons-in-law alliance?

721
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,040
If I sold you out, how could I face anyone
or continue to run the Pan Restaurant?

722
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,520
Good.

723
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,520
It's a deal.

724
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,600
- It's a deal.
- It's a deal.

725
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,280
Fuhui, this is
the sugar wheat cake you wanted.

726
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,560
I've run all over town

727
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,240
and finally found it
near the Four Kings Temple.

728
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,720
Today, at the shop,

729
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,080
Mother saw you and Master Du

730
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,200
entering the Pan Restaurant
one after another.

731
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,600
You aren't planning to form
an alliance and rebel, are you?

732
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,480
