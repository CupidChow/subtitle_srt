EPISODE 14

2
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,480
Cousin, Yuanming, listen to me!

3
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,800
Explain? You traitor!

4
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,080
- I…
- Traitor!

5
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,280
I'm a spy, really!

6
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,200
A spy?

7
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,560
Yes, hear me out!

8
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,280
I'm undercover. Trust me!

9
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,520
Cousin, listen to me!

10
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,440
Cousin, Yuanming!

11
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,920
Think about the Li women.

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,440
None of them are easy to deal with.

13
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,200
I took the risk for the bigger picture.

14
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,800
And for who?

15
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,160
For you two!

16
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,000
With me spying, I'll pass the news.

17
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,800
You'll sleep easy.

18
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,800
Fan Lianghan!

19
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,400
So what?

20
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,280
I'm her favorite son-in-law now.

21
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,320
You two are finished!

22
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,080
Fan Lianghan, you!

23
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,280
Stop!

24
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,920
Shameless fool!

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,240
Yuanming, he's always like this.

26
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,760
Don't bother with him.

27
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,240
Mr. Chai, it's not about that.

28
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,280
I've been thinking about Shouhua's riddle.

29
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
"Four fight for the path."

30
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,160
Not a poem, not a puzzle.

31
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,880
What is it?

32
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,480
I keep thinking, but no clue.

33
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,800
These riddles? I'm lost.

34
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,760
I just know she set a trap.

35
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,880
Trapped all four fops in one go.

36
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,720
Anyone can see it.

37
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,760
They weren't after treasure.

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,360
They wanted women!

39
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,560
She's just and ruthless.

40
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,080
Who'd dare mess with her?

41
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,600
Rumors will die out themselves.

42
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,480
Buddy, with her wit and boldness,

43
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,840
do you still dare take her?

44
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,560
Hold on, Mr. Chai.

45
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,080
What did you just say?

46
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,200
I asked if you'd still answer her riddle.

47
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
It's not too late to back out.

48
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,720
No, before that!

49
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,840
I said she trapped all the fops.

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,520
- That's it! That's it!
- What's the matter?

51
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,840
Yes, exactly that!

52
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,520
Mr. Chai, thanks for clearing that up.

53
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,600
I'll repay you another day.

54
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,040
Yuanming! Yuanming!

55
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,200
Yuanming!

56
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,000
What did I just say?

57
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,280
Shouhua, I've solved it.

58
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,200
Huangfu Mei wrote
in <i>Records of Three Waters</i>

59
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,800
about Queyao, the servant of Li Yu,

60
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,720
Governor of Hunan.

61
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,760
She was too smart and pretty,

62
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,520
drawing trouble from Li's sons.

63
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,720
One night, she called all four of them.

64
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,960
She placed them in separate corners.

65
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,520
Then she exposed them

66
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,840
and scolded them harshly.

67
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,960
Ashamed, they fled and never dared again.

68
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,480
Unknowingly, you mirrored this tale.

69
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,440
Shouhua, did I get it right?

70
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,440
You're exactly right.

71
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,360
Where are the four?

72
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,880
What are you doing?

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,040
Hang them in the woods till morning.

74
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,480
Let them down at dawn.

75
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,680
Got it.

76
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,680
Master! Master!

77
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,280
Spare us, please!

78
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,880
Help!

79
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,720
Since you asked, how could I refuse?

80
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,720
I gave them a good talk
about mending their ways.

81
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,520
I have a gift for you.

82
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,320
Shouhua. I've come by
a rare sandalwood fan.

83
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,760
A tribute from foreign lands,
seldom seen here.

84
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,520
I know you adore pear blossoms,

85
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,880
so I painted them upon it.

86
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,080
Please accept it.

87
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,720
Soft hands hold the fan.

88
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,560
Scents drift under blooms.

89
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,720
May it stay by your side always.

90
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,240
And may you remember

91
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,960
the heart behind it.

92
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,320
Can you truly part with such a treasure?

93
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,440
I await your next challenge.

94
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,400
Then, follow me.

95
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,520
This Bian River before us flows

96
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,520
from Bian Bridge at West Water Gate

97
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,400
past Floating,

98
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,560
Jinliang,

99
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,120
and Xingguo Bridges,

100
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,560
to reach this very spot.

101
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,680
Further east,

102
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,040
it winds past Iron Buddha Temple,

103
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,440
Chunming Market, and Guangji Granary,

104
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,760
beyond the Great Gate,

105
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,680
to the river's mouth.

106
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,520
It drifts eastward,

107
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,880
like spring days,

108
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,800
gone forever.

109
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,360
Look at the endless line
of boats before us,

110
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,040
linking seas and lands,

111
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,640
spanning the empire.

112
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,560
It brings life and wealth
to countless souls.

113
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,040
This is the very lifeline of our Song.

114
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,960
Shouhua,
the past spring is not worth grieving,

115
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,560
for next year's will be gentler still.

116
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,400
Why dwell in sorrow?

117
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,200
Well said.

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,960
Watch carefully.

119
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,640
Shouhua, you…

120
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,760
You said

121
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,800
the past is nothing to grieve,

122
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,200
but I hold on to the past.

123
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,360
Not just that. I never forget a slight.

124
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,000
You shamed me on our wedding night,

125
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,760
made a fool out of me,

126
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,920
and caused me trouble.

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,560
So, now I throw this fan into the river.

128
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,200
If you can undo the past
and return the fan,

129
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,680
we may yet repair this marriage.

130
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,240
You're asking me to fish it out?

131
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,360
But that's impossible!

132
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,160
Shouhua, please, wait!

133
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,160
Shouhua!

134
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,360
How could that be possible?

135
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,360
Shouhua!

136
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,600
Shouhua!

137
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,960
Look at him.

138
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,360
He's lost the will to live.

139
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,240
- He's not jumping to…
- You're young.

140
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,280
- Don't be reckless!
- Don't do anything rash!

141
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,440
You're young.

142
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,840
What can't you overcome?

143
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,000
- Yeah.
- Wait till you're old.

144
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,880
Even Yama won't take you without a fight.

145
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,160
They should cover this river.

146
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,640
Too many fools by the water.

147
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,880
If you're giving up,

148
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,960
leave me your boots and robes.

149
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,600
How could you say that?

150
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,360
- Shoo, shoo!
- Just a joke!

151
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,680
Out of the way.

152
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,800
Stop causing trouble.

153
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,680
So, it really is Mr. Du.

154
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,120
I thought I was seeing things.

155
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,320
Come. Tell me what's troubling you.

156
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,120
Shouhua dropped her fan.

157
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,760
She wants me to fetch it.

158
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,760
If I do, we stay married.

159
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,080
If not, I'm out the door.

160
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,920
Why didn't you say so earlier?

161
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,960
I've got an idea!

162
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,320
You do?

163
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,000
What is it? Tell me.

164
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,400
I'll fish it out for you.

165
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,200
Quick, borrow a net from the boatman!

166
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,880
Hurry. Go on!

167
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,200
- Move it!
- Faster!

168
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,880
Wait for me! I'll be right back.

169
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,280
Check carefully!

170
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,200
What about there? Anything inside?

171
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,560
Nothing.

172
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,280
Then there! Is it there?

173
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,360
Quick, there! Here. Check here!

174
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,840
Yes, right here! This spot!

175
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,320
Search thoroughly!

176
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,200
We'll find it. Here, here!

177
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,160
There, there! That spot!

178
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,400
Carefully!

179
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,320
No way. We won't find it!

180
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,640
Here, here! Listen to me.

181
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,360
I'm second-best at fishing,
and no one in Bianjing dares claim first!

182
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,760
Don't worry, I'll get it before sunset.

183
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
Mr. Du,

184
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,520
I'm truly sincere!

185
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,800
This alliance needs me.

186
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,520
You can't let my cousin kick me out!

187
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,120
Mr. Fan,

188
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,200
the fan fell in an hour ago.

189
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,480
It's probably long gone with the current.

190
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,960
Right. How did I forget that?

191
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,040
Pack up! Let's move!

192
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,440
Master, where to now?

193
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,560
Fool,
haven't you heard of marking the boat?

194
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,480
Where does the Bian River flow?

195
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,240
Head to Bian Bridge.

196
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,560
When the fan floats by,
I'll grab it there!

197
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,000
Yes!

198
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,760
Pack up! Pack up!

199
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,000
Alright, pack up!

200
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,360
You too.

201
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,600
Hurry up! Pack it up. Let's head home!

202
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,640
Go home?

203
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,720
Master, we're not going to the bridge?

204
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,280
Just teasing him.

205
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,680
You think I'm that dumb?

206
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,480
Shouhua,

207
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,480
what do you think of these?

208
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,360
Take your pick.

209
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,080
What's this for?

210
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,880
Aren't you leaving Mr. Du?

211
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,880
Better safe than sorry.

212
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,280
Married women these days,

213
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,400
always meddling and matchmaking.

214
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,560
Maybe life's good,
so they want others to share.

215
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,320
The unhappy ones
drag others into their misery.

216
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,200
Kangning, you look great.

217
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,560
I'd say your husband is doting on you,

218
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,400
serving you with care.

219
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,080
No need to tease me.

220
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,800
I was joking with you.

221
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,040
Don't take it seriously.

222
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,560
These are matches
my mother found for Qiongnu.

223
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,600
You're still in the Du Family,
and if I pick for you,

224
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,360
are you not afraid
Mr. Du will throw me out?

225
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,760
No rush for Qiongnu either.

226
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,600
Mother seems to think that

227
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,960
she or Haode will stay
to keep the family together.

228
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,640
Likely marry someone into the family.

229
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,400
These don't seem right.

230
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,880
Marrying in?

231
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Marrying in is never easy.

232
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,800
Honest ones are plenty.

233
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,680
Good matches are rare.

234
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,720
Take your time.

235
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,160
Indeed.

236
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,360
The restaurant got fine fresh fish today,

237
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,760
and some's been sent home.

238
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,280
My husband hired a chef
to make fish for Mother at home.

239
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
Didn't you say raw fish was too strong?

240
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,240
Today, I'm treating.

241
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,760
Meet me at Pan Restaurant
for something new.

242
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,560
I can't leave my mother-in-law alone.

243
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,200
She's been invited by Mother.

244
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,640
They're enjoying fish slices now.

245
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,920
Go and enjoy yourself.

246
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,640
With your kindness,
playing the hostess now,

247
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,240
I'll gladly follow your lead.

248
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,320
After you.

249
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,520
Please, have a seat.

250
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Shouhua, what's so funny?

251
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,360
Seeing your husband so humble

252
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,080
reminded me of a joke with Kangning,

253
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,160
which made it even funnier.

254
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,680
Your meddling caused all this fuss.

255
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,040
Yes, yes, you're right.

256
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,000
I said it before.

257
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,080
She likes to do the matchmaking now.

258
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,400
The cause lies with her husband.

259
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,200
When did Kangning ever match make?

260
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,840
I'm more confused now.

261
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,560
Someone!

262
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,080
Shouhua, Fuhui,

263
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,320
my marriage with Kangning

264
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,520
had its twists and turns.

265
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,120
It's all thanks to your kindness.

266
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,160
I'll never forget it.

267
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,280
This wine is hardly enough to repay you.

268
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,880
Mr. Chai, let me tell you the truth.

269
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,920
The Chai family's back-and-forth…

270
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,120
We were against it.

271
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,840
You should thank your wife.

272
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,200
Through fire and water, she stood firm.

273
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,680
She'd rather die than marry another.

274
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,880
Your union must've been heaven's will.

275
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,600
Her devotion is rare in this world.

276
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,960
Mistreat her, and we won't let it slide.

277
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,880
I'll remember your words.

278
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,520
Kangning, another toast to you.

279
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,920
Enough.

280
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,680
I'm here to drink with my sisters.

281
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,720
Don't get in the way.

282
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,280
- Alright, alright.
- Off you go!

283
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,120
Relax. I'll excuse myself.

284
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,640
He should thank Shouhua.

285
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,080
If you hadn't taken her spot,

286
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,280
how would he have such a fine wife today?

287
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,360
It was hard on Shouhua.

288
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,720
Mr. Du may be talented and promising,

289
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,000
but he's a thorny flower, hard to swallow.

290
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,560
You can't stand him or let go.

291
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,840
It's maddening.

292
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,400
Shouhua,

293
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,160
a fisherman caught
an eight-catty fish from Bian River.

294
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,280
Knowing you love fish,
we saved it for you.

295
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,880
Try it.

296
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,120
The meat's the finest.

297
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,280
Strange. How does a fan
end up in a fish, Shouhua?

298
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,920
Shouhua.

299
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,320
Such a coincidence!

300
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,000
The fan in the fish,
landing right before you.

301
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,000
Surely heaven's will, reuniting us.

302
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,520
Shouhua, did I pass?

303
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,920
Fine,

304
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,280
when Mother was busy,

305
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,480
who cared for you like a mother?

306
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,440
Now you all team up with outsiders
to trick me.

307
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,440
You…

308
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,040
Do you think that's fair?

309
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,880
Shouhua, I knew nothing!

310
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,840
I…

311
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,560
- Shouhua!
- Shouhua!

312
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,120
Shouhua!

313
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,040
Shouhua!

314
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,440
Kangning, how is it?
Is the food to your taste?

315
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,000
I said this wouldn't work!

316
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,840
Shouhua doesn't listen, yet you did this.

317
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,040
Now I'm the one scolded.

318
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,000
Kangning! Kangning!

319
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,080
What…

320
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,880
What's going on here?

321
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,160
You said

322
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,160
if I got the fan,

323
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,000
I'd pass.

324
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,240
I hope you'll keep your word.

325
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,560
I would,

326
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,560
but someone's too sly.

327
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,920
I doubt this is the same fan.

328
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,400
If you made one, you can make another.

329
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,600
Rare fans don't appear in pairs.

330
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,240
Not necessarily.

331
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,080
Envoys pass through often.

332
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,240
These treasures turn into casual gifts.

333
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,840
You've got one.

334
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,360
What about the second-ranked scholar?

335
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,560
The top scholar?

336
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,320
Even if not,

337
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,320
no craftsmen could copy it?

338
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,840
Plenty of ways to trick me.

339
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,680
So, Shouhua,

340
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,680
how will you prove it's not the same?

341
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,200
You!

342
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,120
So, you're out of words for once.

343
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,280
My fault.

344
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,000
I should've marked it.

345
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,440
Now you've got the upper hand.

346
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,120
Fine.

347
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,440
I'll take this as a pass.

348
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,680
Thank you.

349
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,960
You scold me…

350
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,520
yet still make me shoes.

351
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,040
What a fine wife I've married.

352
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,080
Yet I failed to cherish you.

353
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,120
I deserve a beating.

354
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,760
No wonder you're angry with me.

355
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
Let me try.

356
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,520
This…

357
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,680
In a few days,

358
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,240
it's my late husband's memorial.

359
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,560
By custom, I make a pair to burn.

360
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,160
They're for him.

361
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,200
If you like, I'll make you a pair too.

362
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,800
What's wrong?

363
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,760
You're so clever

364
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,880
yet you don't see what's wrong?

365
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,800
No wonder you've been so cold lately.

366
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,720
Turns out, you're still thinking of him.

367
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,800
Why can't I confront her?

368
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,160
She could sell fish, meat, medicine,

369
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,640
or wine, but no,

370
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,400
she had to open
a tea house across from us.

371
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,320
What's her plan?

372
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,600
Alright, Mother. Sit, Mother. Calm down.

373
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,040
Mother, they sell staple foods.

374
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,240
We sell tea.

375
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,680
It's not the same.

376
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,200
Who says it's not?

377
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,200
Other shops split trades.

378
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,320
Cui's does both.

379
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,480
I saw it.

380
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,040
They use silver teapots!

381
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,440
Tea for a coin, ruining prices!

382
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,160
Go scold her.

383
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,080
Afraid of her?

384
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,320
Don't add to the flames.

385
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,880
Then pour water to kill our spirit?

386
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,240
You're just scared.

387
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,200
Mother,

388
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,800
her shop is her business.

389
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,240
The excitement won't last three days.

390
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,760
A losing trade won't last long.

391
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,640
We mind our own trade.

392
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,000
Why bother with her?

393
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,920
But she sells whatever we sell.

394
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,360
She's stealing business right at our door!

395
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,640
Can I just leave it be?

396
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,840
Mother has long run this shop in Bianjing.

397
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,800
Sifu House is well-known.

398
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,480
Everyone calls you Boss Li with respect.

399
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,960
If you scold her, won't people gossip?

400
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,840
They'll say, "Cui's opened on the street.

401
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,440
Boss Li of Sifu House couldn't stay calm!"

402
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,600
Exactly.

403
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,640
By then,

404
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,200
everyone will go to Cui's
to watch the drama.

405
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,280
I won't let you go

406
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,640
because I won't let you
work for their benefit.

407
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,880
That makes sense.

408
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,680
I almost fell for her trick!

409
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,400
That sly old fox!

410
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,440
That wretched hag, nonsense!

411
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,000
What is this?

412
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,640
PAINTED BY DU YUANMING

413
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,120
Mother?

414
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,960
Mother.

415
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,080
What's this?

416
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:46,160
A wealthy Wang offered 300 strings
for Yangxi's painting.

417
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,520
I thought, 300 strings.

418
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,760
It's real money!

419
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,680
Who would turn that down, right?

420
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,920
Only a fool would!

421
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,680
Mother, how many times have I said this?

422
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,080
If you need money, come to me.

423
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,480
Don't go to Du Yangxi.

424
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,680
Do not speak like he is a stranger.

425
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,320
He's your husband,
my son-in-law, isn't he?

426
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,800
When he was down and out,

427
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,920
I saved his life.

428
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,320
And I gave him my own daughter.

429
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
Now that he's rich,

430
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,080
can't he show some respect?

431
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,160
I didn't beg for this painting.

432
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,800
He gave it willingly.

433
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,440
Mother,

434
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,480
even court painters of Xiangguo Temple

435
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,400
sell for no more than a thousand.

436
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,320
Wu Daozi's murals from the last dynasty

437
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,640
are worth just 300 strings.

438
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,360
No matter how good his work is,
it's not beyond the Painting Sage.

439
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,280
They're not after the painting.

440
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,000
They're just looking for connections.

441
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,160
That's the way of the world.

442
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,680
Nothing strange about it.

443
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,680
I know you're above all this.

444
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,400
I won't ask again.

445
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,640
Fine, fine. I'll return this one too.

446
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,800
- Here.
- This way.

447
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,680
Mother, Shouhua…

448
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,040
I've brought her here.

449
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,560
Chou'er, greet Mrs. Du.

450
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,680
Greetings, Mrs. Du.

451
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,760
What a tidy little one.

452
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,360
But how did you end up with this name?

453
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,960
I had scabs as a child

454
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,240
and lost all my hair.

455
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,840
So, they called me Chou'er, meaning ugly.

456
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,560
But I grew out of it.

457
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,400
My father said,

458
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,680
"Her heart's kind, not her name.

459
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,360
She's handy but not a talker."

460
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,680
I'll keep my head down and serve Mrs. Du.

461
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,240
Mother picked her after seeing over ten.

462
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,160
She's perfect at housework.
And she's quick-witted.

463
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,600
Shouhua, she can be your helper too.

464
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,960
Take her home today.

465
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,960
Mother, you've worked hard for me.

466
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,080
Who else would care for you like I do?

467
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,840
Chou'er, you've greeted her.

468
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,200
Come, I've got something to tell you.

469
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,680
Shouhua,

470
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,440
I know you're still
thinking of the one before.

471
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,520
Indeed.

472
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,200
Master Shiyi was truly exceptional.

473
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,760
His character and talent,

474
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,440
his grace refined,

475
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,440
his bearing extraordinary.

476
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,160
And he treated you so well.

477
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,680
But he had one flaw.

478
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,920
His life was too short!

479
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,960
Mother!

480
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,080
You said you'd mourn him for three years,

481
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,920
and I let you.

482
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,680
Master Shiyi was a noble man,

483
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,440
but Mr. Du is also an excellent match.

484
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,040
How is he not good enough for you?

485
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
Shouhua,

486
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,800
from now on,

487
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,960
let go of your sorrow,

488
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,680
open your heart,

489
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,720
and live well with your husband.

490
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,360
When you're my age, you'll understand.

491
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,360
The past, no matter how good,

492
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,680
is just a memory.

493
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,760
What matters is the one before you now.

494
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,640
That's what lasts.

495
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,800
Mother,

496
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,200
Master Shiyi was kind to our family.

497
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,920
I always feel guilty.

498
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,200
But when I face Mr. Du,

499
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,960
I don't know what to do.

500
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,200
I've never met anyone like him.

501
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,840
- Cousin.
- Why are they back again?

502
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,640
Cousin, cousin. Cousin!

503
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,440
I'm too busy. I have accounts to settle.

504
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,240
Cousin, Mr. Du is so troubled.

505
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,080
Help him out. Come on.

506
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
No. I've offended Kangning for his sake!

507
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,560
I swore not to meddle.

508
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,920
Cousin, it was your trouble
with the marriage

509
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,960
that dragged Mr. Du into this mess.

510
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,200
You left him behind now.

511
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,520
Where's your conscience?

512
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,880
Am I wrong?

513
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,040
Come. Come on.

514
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,640
Sit.

515
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,160
Have a seat.

516
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,000
I, Du Yangxi, may be humble,

517
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,640
but I have my pride.

518
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,960
Since I was young,

519
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,080
I never lowered my head

520
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,520
and never submitted to anyone.

521
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,440
But for her, I've done so much,

522
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,960
treading carefully,

523
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,800
afraid to displease her.

524
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,000
Laugh if you like,

525
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,000
but now I check her mood before I speak.

526
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,160
You don't know how bitter it is.

527
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,000
You all know about her first husband.

528
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,600
I heard Fuhui mention him.

529
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,960
He's gone now.

530
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,280
Why bring him up?

531
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,600
Not another word.

532
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,800
What did she say?

533
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,920
Just endless praise.

534
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,120
How graceful, how talented.

535
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,600
Without his illness, he was perfect.

536
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,400
She even said,

537
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,120
tie the three of us together and weigh us,

538
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,280
we'd still fall short by an ounce.

539
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,960
Doesn't that just make your blood boil?

540
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,400
- Really?
- Yes.

541
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,280
I've never heard Kangning mention this.

542
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,520
He worried that Shouhua was lonely

543
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,840
and often invited her sisters over.

544
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,640
Kangning learned zither from her father
but stopped practicing.

545
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,960
She resumed after Shouhua joined
the Wu family. Mr. Wu found her a master.

546
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,760
And when the Li family lost their lands,

547
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,760
the Wu family helped fight the case
and got them back.

548
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,120
He cared so much.

549
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,640
It's no wonder she can't forget.

550
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,160
Mr. Du, just teasing.

551
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,360
He's gone.

552
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,920
She can praise him however she likes.

553
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,320
Right? It doesn't mean much now.

554
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
Yuanming,

555
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,880
they say men love the new,
women cling to the past.

556
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,080
She's married to you
but still holds onto her first husband.

557
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,520
It shows her loyalty and deep feelings.

558
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,840
You've got to admire that.

559
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,320
Treat her sincerely
and she'll come around.

560
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,480
He's gone now.

561
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,200
How can he compete with you?

562
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,240
If he were alive,

563
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,640
I might have a chance to compete with him.

564
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,880
But now,

565
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,080
who can win a deceased darling husband
in her heart?

566
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,360
If he lived, would it be your turn?

567
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,400
Cousin!

568
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,080
Chou'er, who told you to clean up?

569
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,680
It's that meddling Chunlai.

570
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,320
My lady,
Master drank too much at Pan Restaurant.

571
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,000
No one could stop him.

572
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,880
- Master.
- Come in, quickly!

573
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,480
Careful now.

574
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,640
Come, quickly!

575
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,480
Hurry, get him in.

576
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,760
Lend a hand.

577
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,360
Master?

578
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,600
Tell me.

579
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,120
How am I worse than him?

580
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,360
Tell me.

581
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,480
Tell me.

582
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,680
Master.

583
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,480
Do you despise me?

584
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,320
What nonsense.

585
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,240
Who'd despise the third-ranked scholar?

586
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,120
I'm no third-ranked scholar.

587
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,600
I'm just an orphan with no parents.

588
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,760
I survived a shipwreck,

589
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,960
drifted ashore in a wooden tub.

590
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,400
A kind washerwoman found me

591
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,520
and took me in.

592
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,880
The villagers called me cursed from birth.

593
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,280
<i>She took in a cursed star like me.</i>

594
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,400
<i>She endured gossip, scorn from her kin,</i>

595
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,880
<i>and rejection from her husband.</i>

596
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,960
<i>Yet, she raised me to adulthood.</i>

597
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,880
I can't compare to Wu Shiyi.

598
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,240
I have no noble family,
no lofty character,

599
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,960
and I lack his generosity of spirit.

600
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,360
I'm selfish, greedy, and petty.

601
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,200
I wanted to excel in the exams.

602
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,160
I wanted the world to see

603
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,400
that even an orphan

604
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,720
could achieve greatness

605
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,560
and honor his name.

606
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,200
I wanted them to know

607
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,560
that the washerwoman they pitied

608
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,360
would one day be a Noble Lady.

609
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,560
But in doing so,
I failed to be a true gentleman.

610
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:30,520
Is this why you don't want me,

611
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,880
Shouhua?

612
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,000
How could I not want you?

613
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,640
Others say you're sophisticated and deep,

614
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,040
but I see all your goodness.

615
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
They never suffered your hardships.

616
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,320
How could they know
the wisdom born of pain?

617
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,200
But you avoid me.

618
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,160
When have I?

619
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,560
I thought couples should live
with respect and politeness

620
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,200
to last long,

621
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,800
but I didn't know what you truly wanted.

622
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,200
Liang Hong and Meng Guang
are polite and diplomatic in marriage.

623
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,880
I don't want to be a distant husband.

624
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,600
I don't want your constant respect,

625
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,520
keeping your distance. I want…

626
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,040
your kiss.

627
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,840
Fine. You can let me go now.

628
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,200
You're lying again.

629
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,520
But the hangover soup is getting cold.

630
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,240
Then tell me one thing about me
that's better than him.

631
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,200
You're sharper than him,

632
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,240
even pretending to be drunk and foolish.

633
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,440
<i>Shouhua,</i>

634
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,440
<i>please love me dearly.</i>

635
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,600
<i>Don't avoid me.</i>

636
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,040
Come in.

637
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,840
Master, Master Sang couldn't wait

638
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,720
and has gone to the scholarly assembly.

639
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,760
He asked me to inform you.

640
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,720
I see.

641
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,920
You may leave.

642
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,680
You got up early to paint.

643
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,160
What is it?

644
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,440
When did you hide it?

645
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,160
Hand it over before someone laughs.

646
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,040
Painting landscapes is a refined art.

647
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,080
Only the impure would think otherwise.

648
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,240
Masterpieces hang in grand halls.

649
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,440
Why not my wife?

650
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,680
Who dares mock that?

651
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,520
Don't keep it hidden.

652
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,680
Wear it often.

653
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,320
Then my midnight effort
won't be wasted.

654
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,560
- It's not proper.
- I don't want you to be proper.

655
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,280
Don't think I don't know.

656
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,880
You copy scriptures daily

657
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,160
to pray for him.

658
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,200
Shouhua,

659
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,000
I don't want you live in the past.

660
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,240
I want you to know that you're my wife,

661
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,720
not someone's widow.

662
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,000
Do you understand?

663
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,040
I do.

664
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,840
When I'm away,

665
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,920
think of me while painting.

666
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,560
Remember me while embroidering.

667
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,680
If you're upset,
curse me, scold me. I'd still be glad.

668
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,440
Okay.

669
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,800
I'll do as you say.

670
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,000
Now, will you give it to me?

671
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,200
Then, if you married someone else,

672
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,560
would you obey him like this?

673
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,320
What if Sang Yanrang
fainted before your sedan,

674
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,600
would you marry him too?

675
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,560
That's nonsense.

676
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,760
Don't say such things!

677
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,920
Even if it were him,

678
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,400
I'd still win you over anyway!

679
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,600
Let him keep dreaming.

680
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,080
Why are you acting crazy so early?

681
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,240
Stop it! Hand it over.

682
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,400
Come on. Give it to me!

683
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,160
Master.

684
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,920
What now?

685
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,160
The mistress says it's almost sunrise,

686
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,400
time for breakfast.

687
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,600
I'll come at once.

688
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,760
Go and prepare.

689
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,640
Understood.

690
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,280
Are you happy now?

691
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,120
This is so embarrassing!

692
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,760
Shouhua, are you upset?

693
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,600
I was wrong, Shouhua!

694
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,480
Dear guest, take a look.

695
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,320
Here you go!

696
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,120
Master Liu,
we've got fine Jian Tea in stock.

697
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,320
- Come in for a cup.
- Tomorrow.

698
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,560
- I'll come tomorrow!
- A cup.

699
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,320
It won't take long.

700
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,560
Tomorrow, I promise!

701
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,360
Miss, take a look at these flowers!

702
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,320
Master Wang,

703
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,160
Master Liu, try some herbal tea!

704
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,160
One sip will refresh you

705
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,560
and keep you energized all day.

706
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,400
Master Liu, how about a cup?

707
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,320
Come, come!

708
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,480
Here. This way, please!

709
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,040
Please, hurry inside!

710
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,240
Slow down. Careful!

711
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,880
Tomorrow, tomorrow!

712
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,880
Two guests,

713
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,720
come in for some herbal tea!

714
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,920
- That's her.
- Hurry in, Come on!

715
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,160
Everyone inside, work quickly!

716
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,120
Treat them well!

717
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,400
Mother, it's just down the street.

718
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,440
Her tender mutton with chilled noodles
is truly unmatched!

719
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,320
They've stolen so much of our business!

720
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,200
All that, just for the noodles?

721
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,840
Look at him. His eyes

722
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,960
are about to fall into the soup!
Might as well cook them too!

723
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,080
Mother,

724
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,200
I may not serve tea as well as Kangning,

725
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,920
but I'm decent enough.

726
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,480
- Why don't I join?
- Nonsense!

727
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,680
The shop's struggling.

728
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,600
I only asked you to help for a few days.

729
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,400
We're not that desperate!

730
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,840
Why throw yourself
into a crowd of stinking men?

731
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,560
Don't you want a good husband someday?

732
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,800
Ah, here you are.

733
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,160
Look at that shameless fool!

734
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,400
- Please.
- Let's see how long her pride lasts.

735
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,680
Exactly.

736
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,640
Alright, go back.

737
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,360
You go inside first.

738
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,280
This one's lovely,

739
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,000
- and the color is so vibrant!
- Yes.

740
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,920
This one's nice too.

741
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,680
I'll take it!

742
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,200
UNIQUE CHILLED NOODLES

743
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,120
Why are you here?

744
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,000
I'm here for you, Dear Rong.

745
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,840
Mother!

746
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,960
You!

747
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,880
Have some respect! What are you doing?

748
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,920
It's been a while, Dear Rong.

749
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,560
You've grown prettier.

750
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,920
Good girl, have you missed me?

751
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,560
Come. Come here!

752
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,880
We're doing business here.

753
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,080
Take your money and go gamble!

754
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,240
Stop pestering her!

755
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,080
Leave now!

756
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,160
I'll come back tonight when I win.

757
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,240
Go on!

758
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,120
Wait for me!

759
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,240
You never should've adopted that fool.

760
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,040
He angered Father into illness,

761
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,320
and he bothers us every day.

762
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,720
It's your fault for lacking ability.

763
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,160
Why don't you find me
a third-ranked scholar son-in-law?

764
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,240
Do I have to keep swallowing this shame?

765
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,880
No matter how capable they are,
they're not from my womb.

766
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,320
Even if I'm not the best,

767
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,200
you'll rely on me when you're old.

768
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,360
If you keep scolding me, I'm done!

769
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,720
You little brat, you're driving me crazy!

770
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,880
CUI TEAHOUSE

771
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,160
Master Wang,

772
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,160
been drinking again, haven't you?

773
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,560
You guessed it!

774
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,160
- Where's Dear Rong?
- Inside, of course.

775
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,800
Here, have some Er Chen Soup.

776
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,640
It's just right.

777
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,240
- Alright, alright!
- Please.

778
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,680
Come in!

779
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,040
Taoist Ritual is done today.

780
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,880
You've fulfilled your duty.

781
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,680
Mr. Du is drowning his sorrows
at Pan Restaurant.

782
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,920
If Fan Lianghan comes back,

783
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,800
he'll claim that Shouhua bullied him.

784
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,320
If you ask me,

785
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,000
Shouhua should go back
and coax him a little.

786
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,440
He's a third-ranked scholar after all,

787
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,240
a husband so many in the capital envy!

788
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,680
He's ridiculous.

789
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,360
That one's been gone for years!

790
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,920
Still jealous over someone who died young.

791
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,920
And Shouhua has to comfort him.

792
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,120
Such a petty man.

793
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,760
I used to think marriage

794
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,400
was just companionship

795
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,800
to pass the days peacefully.

796
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,680
Who'd have thought he'd be so tender,

797
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,960
so affectionate,

798
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,320
so devoted?

799
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,760
All his thoughts are on me.

800
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:57,640
Honestly,
sometimes I'm scared when I see him.

801
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,080
Scared of what?

802
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,200
Scared he'll grow cold,

803
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,520
that he'll be disappointed.

804
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,200
Scared I'm not as good as he thinks.

805
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,680
Shouhua, you're already the best.

806
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,520
But honestly,

807
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,680
those three brothers-in-law are too close.

808
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,000
We need to break them up somehow
or they'll keep causing trouble.

809
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,880
Shouhua, don't you agree?

810
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,560
Yes, you're right.

811
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,880
What's wrong? What are you looking at?

812
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,320
Don't look.

813
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,520
Madam, are you feeling warm?

814
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,760
I'm fine. No worries.

815
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,920
Lianghan, Fuhui is with child now.

816
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,200
From now on, drink and gamble less

817
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,400
and stay home with her more.

818
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,920
Just keep her happy.

819
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,160
- Alright.
- Young couples are like that.

820
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,440
Who hasn't had their ups and downs?

821
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,240
Why scold you and not others?

822
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,520
Because she cares for you.

823
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,120
Yes, yes.

824
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,480
Don't worry, madam.

825
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,600
I know my wife loves me most.

826
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,400
Yes, she scolds you because she cares.

827
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,840
She just wants the best for you, right?

828
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,920
They've arrived.

829
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,560
- Mistress, they're back.
- I'll go.

830
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,880
Chunlai, serve two melons.

831
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,080
Got it!

832
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,400
- Kangning.
- Go fetch your wife.

833
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,480
Okay.

834
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,720
- Fuhui, careful, I'll help you.
- Alright.

835
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,160
Come. Take it slow.

836
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,480
Here.

837
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,720
Hurry, come in!

838
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,960
The sun is too harsh. Go inside quickly.

839
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,400
Lianghan sent over

840
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,040
some plums and white peaches.

841
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,480
Go inside and enjoy them.

842
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,320
Chunlai, cut two big, sweet ones.

843
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,720
Not the chilled ones!

844
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,240
The well-chilled ones aren't good.

845
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,840
Fuhui can't have them.

846
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,200
Madam.

847
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,160
That wretch won't go away.

848
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,440
Who knows who he's targeting now?

849
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,960
Mr. Du is a scholar, not a fighter.
How could he scare anyone?

850
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,120
Don't worry, madam.

851
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,040
I'll deal with him.

852
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,760
I'll make sure
he won't dare show his face here again.

853
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,640
Yes, teach him a lesson.

854
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,280
Don't go easy on him.

855
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,200
Even if he dies, he deserves it.

856
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,320
Yes!

857
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,400
- Let's go.
- Okay, madam.

858
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,720
So what if he has a title?

859
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,600
Your crimes will be exposed in court.

860
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,360
Forget becoming an official.

861
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,400
You'll lose everything, even your life.

862
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,160
I spared you,
and you still harass the Li family?

863
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,640
Risking your life for lust?

864
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,200
I'm going home to mourn.

865
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,200
I've said goodbye to Shouhua.
I won't come again.

866
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,880
Nonsense! You scoundrel, still lying!

867
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,120
Get out, now!

868
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,480
See you again, and I'll beat you!

869
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,960
Let's go!

870
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,760
