00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,480
EPISODE 22

2
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,480
SHEN MANSION

3
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,080
This is your second uncle's wife.

4
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,080
This is your third uncle's wife.

5
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,120
This is your fourth uncle's wife.

6
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,680
They are all your elders.

7
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,280
Just call them aunts.

8
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,120
STUDY THE NATURE OF THINGS

9
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,920
Greetings, aunts.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,080
I pay my respects to you all.

11
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,080
I heard that Huizhao is seriously ill.

12
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,280
I am extremely worried,
so I came to visit today.

13
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,880
I wonder if he has gotten any better.

14
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,160
Right. Rumors say he has injured his head.

15
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,720
If there's a blood clot,
it could be life-threatening.

16
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,480
Is that true?

17
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,560
I wonder where the rumors came from,
and it has worried you all.

18
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,640
He just has some minor external injuries.

19
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,480
He'll go to the yamen
to deal with affairs soon.

20
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,680
Old Lady, since ancient times,
a rumor starts with one person,

21
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,600
but it can spread
through the city unstopped.

22
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,280
It's futile, no matter how much you deny.

23
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,280
We might as well
take advantage of this time

24
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,040
to make arrangements
for the Flower Festival

25
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,200
and show everyone
that Huizhao is fine and healthy.

26
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,160
Look, I have thought it through.

27
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,760
On the day of the Spring coming,

28
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,760
we would rearrange the pond pavilions,
terrace, flowers, and trees.

29
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,760
The peonies in the garden are flourishing.

30
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,920
We could get more peonies,
peach, and plum trees.

31
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,240
Plant bamboo in the corner of the wall.

32
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,360
A beautiful scene can't be without bamboo.

33
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,520
Other families

34
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,400
would play cuju and game fowl,
so it'd be very noisy and lively.

35
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,120
But it actually makes others
lose interest in visiting the garden.

36
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,760
In my opinion, we can put
some antiques and accessories

37
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,960
for small betting games
in the southeast corner.

38
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,280
On the west side, we could set up archery
targets, pitching pots, and swing frames.

39
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,840
This could show
our attentiveness and hospitality.

40
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,200
Considering the reputation
of the Shen Garden in the capital,

41
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,680
we could make 20 or 30 strings
for tea money only.

42
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,840
During the Flower Festival,
we open our gardens to the public

43
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,480
in order to share the joy with everyone

44
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,960
and appreciate the beauty of spring.

45
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,720
The Shen family has never charged
a coin for tea.

46
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,920
Where does this vulgar commoner come from?

47
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,760
GUINIANG

48
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,160
SHENG MU

49
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,960
This is your aunt.

50
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,120
Greetings.

51
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,160
The gardeners and garden keepers

52
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,520
have to be busy for a month
during the Flower Festival.

53
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,840
This tea money is their reward.

54
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,680
Guiniang.

55
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,040
Hurry up. Come over here.

56
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,800
Come to me. Come here.

57
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,520
Grandmother, may you be in great health.

58
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,840
Spend more time with me this time.

59
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,200
Don't rush to leave.

60
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,960
- Yes.
- Liu.

61
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,640
Order someone

62
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,600
to clean up the Wutong Yard
where Guiniang lives.

63
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,200
We've cleaned it up every day.

64
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,760
- Rest assured
- Good.

65
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,000
It's been not even two months.

66
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,480
Guiniang has become even more beautiful.

67
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,920
Last year,
at the Jinming Pool Flower Festival,

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,560
many people wanted to know you.

69
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,840
That embroidered screen with flowers
you sent to my house

70
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,920
was seen by Madam Zhang
of the Imperial College.

71
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,720
She insisted on taking it away.

72
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,120
You'll have to embroider another one
for me later.

73
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,040
Yes.

74
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,520
Mother.

75
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,440
Why did you choose
such a wife for Huizhao?

76
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,280
Madam, please have some tea.

77
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,960
It's not me being picky.
The wedding was arranged too hastily.

78
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,040
<i>They all look elegant but are mean inside.</i>

79
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,280
<i>Who are they trying to impress</i>
<i>with their pretense?</i>

80
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,280
<i>They are aiming against Haode.</i>

81
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
<i>If it were me,</i>

82
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,440
<i>I'd drag them out and beat them up,</i>
<i>these old hags.</i>

83
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Alright.

84
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,320
We've seen each other.

85
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,240
And I'm tired now.

86
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,240
I'm going back to take a nap.

87
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,760
Please make yourselves comfortable.

88
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,280
See you then, Old Lady.

89
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,440
Old Lady, I'll take you back.

90
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,000
You attend to the guests for me.

91
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,680
Guiniang.

92
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,400
You accompany me.

93
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,680
Yes.

94
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,720
Be careful.

95
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,960
I'll go see how
the preparation is for lunch.

96
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,080
I'll excuse myself.

97
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,320
She's already been
married into the family.

98
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,520
Why did you intentionally
make things difficult for her?

99
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,400
Mother has made a bad decision.

100
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,440
For the Li family's marriage alliance,
I've visited them again and again,

101
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,800
only then did they agree
to marry their daughter over.

102
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,600
Yet Huizhao just
called off the engagement.

103
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,400
I'm feeling very uncomfortable.

104
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,320
Fine.

105
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,680
It's alright if he married a lady
from a reputable family.

106
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,400
Out of all the girls,

107
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,640
he has to marry such a vulgar girl.

108
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,360
Tea money?

109
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,200
Mom, Haode is sensible,
and Leshan is clever.

110
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,880
They surely won't suffer a loss.

111
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,000
Before, I hope
my daughters to be obedient.

112
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,640
But after they get married, I want them
to be assertive and unruly.

113
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,960
A daughter-in-law will get bullied

114
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,760
if she's that sensible.

115
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,880
Haode has never been good
at arguing since childhood.

116
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,120
I need to see for myself to be at ease.

117
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,760
Tell him to hurry up.

118
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,800
Mom, it's right ahead.

119
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,440
There might be a distinguished guest.

120
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,080
Let's go around to the back door.

121
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,040
I'll just take a peek at Haode and go.
I don't want to cause any trouble.

122
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,040
Take a detour.

123
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,640
Here are the past two months of case files
organized by Judge Fang and Official Xia.

124
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,160
Please review.

125
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,080
<i>There are so many case files.</i>

126
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,320
<i>So, I used to spend my days like this.</i>

127
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,720
Is Haode still receiving guests?

128
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,240
What's the matter?

129
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,480
Today, the second, third,
and fourth uncle's wives all came.

130
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,880
And your aunt Madam Qiu.

131
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,640
She is the most difficult to deal with.

132
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,960
I think Lady Haode will have a hard time.

133
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,680
Aunt?

134
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,840
Those distinguished guests have arrived.

135
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,120
Everyone,

136
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
we have distinguished guests here.

137
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,160
- Invite them in now.
- Yes.

138
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,880
Mom told me to be tolerant.

139
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,880
Don't let others ridicule our Li family
not having proper family education.

140
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,360
When you go in there, just keep your calm

141
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,960
and not lose your temper.

142
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,960
Just let them talk. Ignore what they say.

143
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,320
If we talk back to elders,

144
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,920
we might be ridiculed.

145
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,040
Those despicable women! How dare they!

146
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,720
If you don't behave,

147
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,080
I'll send you back home tomorrow
and ask Mom to confine you.

148
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,520
I understand.

149
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,520
Let's go.

150
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,000
The Li family is selling tea,

151
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,440
famous in Bianjing
for their tea-making skills.

152
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,360
I was eager to see for myself,
so I invited you to make the tea.

153
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,520
Look.

154
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,880
She's really good at it,

155
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,920
much better than my tea-serving maid.

156
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,160
I wonder how many young ladies
there are in the Li family.

157
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,120
I have five daughters.

158
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,800
I heard that the eldest daughter
is married to a third-ranked scholar.

159
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,360
The second and third daughters
are married to wealthy families.

160
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,200
And there's no need to mention
the fourth daughter.

161
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,840
Madam Li, apart from
your skills in making tea,

162
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,360
you also have splendid strategies

163
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,320
to enable your daughters
to marry into prestigious families.

164
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,800
Why not share them with us?

165
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,520
Madame Qiu, didn't you
want to have some tea?

166
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Why all the talking?

167
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,360
Aunt, if you'd like some tea,
I will make it for you.

168
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,480
Isn't your Li family the one selling tea
on Pan Restaurant?

169
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,280
What? Can't I have your tea?

170
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,520
- Haode.
- If you want to have the Li family's tea,

171
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,400
you must go to Sifu House
and spend some money.

172
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,640
Today, my mother has come as a guest.

173
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,680
Since you claim
to be on behalf of the Shen family,

174
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,920
we should treat her
as a guest with hospitality.

175
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,400
Please forgive me
to be humble and ignorant.

176
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,160
I have never heard of any host
to let the guest serve tea.

177
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,880
If this were to spread,
I'm afraid others might laugh at you

178
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,040
for being disrespectful
and lacking etiquette.

179
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,120
I was fully considering your position,

180
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,160
which is why I was bold to speak frankly.

181
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,720
I hope you don't mind.

182
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,160
H-how dare you!

183
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,960
How can you be so impolite to an elder?

184
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,560
My daughter-in-law
doesn't even dare to talk in front of me.

185
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,440
Do you know how to respect the elders?

186
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,920
What is this all about?

187
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,320
Huizhao, you are really recovered.

188
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,960
Those unpleasant words outside
are indeed just rumors.

189
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,880
Nothing. We are just joking.

190
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,520
Joking.

191
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,400
Aunts,

192
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,000
recently, the Kaifeng Court
has been ordered to arrest gamblers.

193
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,600
Offenders will be executed on the spot.

194
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,040
If Zhong and Huan dare go
to the gambling house again,

195
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,120
as their elder cousin,
I will show no mercy.

196
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,240
Dare not, definitely.

197
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,120
When I return,
I will strictly discipline them.

198
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,200
Huizhao, you are his close elder cousin.

199
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,320
Please take care of him.

200
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,000
I was unaware that you are here

201
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,960
and did not personally greet you.

202
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,280
Madam, please have this cup of tea
and forgive my rudeness.

203
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,920
Huizhao.

204
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,280
Not at all. You're always busy.

205
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,040
Have tea.

206
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,360
SHEN MANSION

207
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,600
Alright, there's no need to see me off.

208
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,600
Huizhao, save the formalities.

209
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,640
I can't accept this, really.

210
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,760
I can't accept it.

211
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,880
As a son-in-law,
I must pay my respects to you.

212
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,680
You must want to talk with Haode.
I dare not disturb you.

213
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,120
Since ancient times, women and men
should be matched for marriage.

214
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,120
Our family is indeed
not as prestigious as theirs.

215
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,320
I was afraid that you'll be wronged.

216
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,640
I didn't expect Huizhao
to be so protective of you.

217
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,000
Then I could be at ease.

218
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,880
It's okay. It's just a small case today.

219
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,200
I won't take it to heart at all.

220
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,520
But that Madam Qiu is his aunt.

221
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,520
She's a relative to him,
and it will never change.

222
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,840
Later on, apologize to her.

223
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,240
I'm leaving. I'm leaving, Huizhao.

224
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,320
I'm leaving.

225
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,240
- Go back.
- Be careful on the road.

226
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,480
Go back.

227
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,760
How do you remember about
the two cousins gambling?

228
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,480
Qingshi reported it.

229
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,520
I can't even recognize
who those two aunts are.

230
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,160
I heard it from him,

231
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,280
this aunt, though not
my grandmother's own daughter,

232
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,320
has been raised by her since childhood.

233
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,240
So, she's arrogant and spoiled.

234
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,520
I apologize for her being rude.

235
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,120
Considering you stood up for me,
I won't be mad anymore.

236
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,960
Having read the case files for so long,
you might be dizzy now.

237
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,680
Let me read for you.

238
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,080
Leshan.

239
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,920
Mom.

240
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,440
It's such a small deal.
Don't take it to heart.

241
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,840
What a man, Shen Huizhao.

242
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,360
He humiliated me for his mother-in-law.

243
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,560
If not for you, I wouldn't put up with it.

244
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,440
- What is this?
- Madam.

245
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,400
It's a gift sent from the Li family.

246
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,360
Including fine teas and hams.
I am going to send them to the storehouse.

247
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,600
Inferior goods.
I don't care to look. Just throw it away.

248
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,040
Well…

249
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,240
Yes.

250
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,920
The eldest son of the family,
Liu Zong, has passed away.

251
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,480
His son Liu Ting
followed his mother, Wang,

252
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,800
who's remarried into Liu Yu's family.

253
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,640
Later, this Liu Ting died young.

254
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,200
His second Uncle Liu Wen

255
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,840
wants to have his son adopted by
his brother to carry on the line.

256
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,480
This is simply
a case of inheritance dispute.

257
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,400
Why force Wang to divorce Liu Yu?

258
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,800
Mrs. Wang's two husbands
both shared the surname Liu.

259
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,680
Distant relatives
beyond the fifth generations.

260
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,800
It's illegal to marry a widow
from a distant relative.

261
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,040
Therefore, Judge Fang has asked
the two to divorce.

262
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,240
Huizhao, you remember it all?

263
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Then, continue.

264
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,560
Do you remember

265
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,040
which chapter and section
the clause you just recalled

266
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,320
is in the law?

267
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,760
Take your time. No need to rush.

268
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,880
PENAL LAW

269
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,360
Take your time.

270
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,680
Stop it.

271
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,600
I was being too impatient.

272
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,400
The physician said that recovery
still requires some time.

273
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,840
It takes time.

274
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,920
It's alright. Don't rush.

275
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,080
Take it slowly.

276
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,120
Let's take a look at this.

277
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,680
This is a case of dispute over inheritance
between a stepwife and a maid.

278
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,680
This is about a stepson scheming to take
over the legitimate son's property.

279
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,280
Which one would you like to read first?

280
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,040
I suggest we read this one first.

281
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,400
It must be interesting.

282
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,960
Today, I wish to take Haode out.
So, I shall report to you first.

283
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,880
You want to go to the yamen again?

284
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,880
No, stay at home and recuperate.

285
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,080
My desk is already piled with case files.

286
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,280
I can't push them all to others to handle.

287
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,760
Besides, I already rested for a bit.

288
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,320
I'll follow the physician's instructions
and take the medicine.

289
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,080
With Haode by my side,
what is there to worry about?

290
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,400
Mom.

291
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,840
Mom, save me.

292
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,240
I'll go take a look.

293
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,920
Mother.

294
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,480
Mother.

295
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,600
- Mother.
- What's wrong?

296
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,440
Mom, uphold justice for me.

297
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,480
Let me see. What happened?

298
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,240
Why did you become like this?

299
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,680
- Oh my.
- Grandmother.

300
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,120
After mother fell asleep last night,
someone snuck into her room.

301
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,080
We have interrogated
the maid on night watch.

302
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,600
They all said they didn't see anyone,
nor did they hear any noise.

303
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,240
The visitor only left this note.

304
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,600
"I am a born bald, enduring suffering.

305
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,040
Long have I heard you have beautiful hair

306
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,200
and disdain artificial hairpieces.

307
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,840
Tonight, at midnight, I'll come
by the moonlight to take your hair.

308
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,880
Leaving behind a coin
as a token of thanks.

309
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,480
The Peddler Huang San
from Bianjing market."

310
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,000
No need to say more.

311
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,280
- It was all your doing.
- Aunt. It's all my fault.

312
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,280
This peddler, Huang San, sold wigs
outside Xiangguo Temple.

313
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,480
Because he fought with others,
I punished him to receive caning,

314
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,360
and he made a fuss outside
the yamen for two months.

315
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,280
I thought that was the end.

316
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,960
But I didn't expect him to seek revenge.

317
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,960
I'm sorry to implicate you.

318
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,960
Huizhao, you still defend her?

319
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,320
Can anyone enter the Shen house at will?

320
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,880
Look at me and my hair.

321
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,960
How can I return
to the Qiu family like this?

322
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,600
How can I go out like this?

323
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,880
Aunt.

324
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,360
Those who deliver water and vegetables
come and go daily.

325
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,480
Someone must have taken advantage of it
to sneak in here and act at night.

326
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,840
It's my lack of vigilance. I'm so sorry.

327
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,880
I'll order a search
throughout the entire mansion--

328
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,560
No, search the entire city
and be sure to capture the villain.

329
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,600
Aunt, please leave
after your hair grows well.

330
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,760
You!

331
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,520
- Huizhao.
- Grandmother.

332
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,480
I have matters to attend to at the yamen.
I have to leave now with Haode.

333
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,520
Go, go.

334
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,120
Come back. Don't leave.

335
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,720
- Mother.
- Huizhao.

336
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,120
Mother.

337
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,760
I am his aunt.

338
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,680
Is this how he treats his elder?

339
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,200
Look at my hair.

340
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,080
Mother.

341
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,760
My hair.

342
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,240
Alright.

343
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,760
Guiniang.

344
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,480
Apply makeup and comb the hair
for your mother.

345
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,920
What a disgraceful look it is.

346
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,360
Don't forget.

347
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,120
Choose the best wig for her.

348
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,880
Yes.

349
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,040
Mother.

350
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,680
You were sleeping so soundly.

351
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,720
Brother.

352
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,480
Leshan did it to vent for me.

353
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,440
It's understandable.

354
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,160
Sorry, brother-in-law.

355
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,960
I really couldn't help it.

356
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,200
If you do anything naughty again,

357
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,120
at least tell me in advance,

358
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,600
so I can be prepared.

359
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,560
Haode.

360
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,600
Did you see her appearance?

361
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,960
It's so funny.

362
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,040
Don't do so next time.

363
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,400
It's so funny.

364
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,520
INDICTMENT

365
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,040
<i>Huizhao, don't worry about it.</i>

366
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,800
<i>Just do as we said.</i>

367
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,000
<i>You can handle it.</i>

368
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,920
Judge Fang.

369
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,680
The case of the stepwife and maid,
An, fighting over the inheritance,

370
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,360
the judgment was somewhat inappropriate.

371
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,840
May I ask what's improper
about my judgment?

372
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,240
You two should sit down and talk.

373
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,360
An gave birth to a son for Luo Bing,

374
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,240
so Luo Bing divided his property
into three, giving one part to her.

375
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,200
The stepwife, Zou, has always been
on bad terms with Luo Bing.

376
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,760
They've been separated for many years.

377
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,280
Luo was old and confused,
so Zou came back to seize the property.

378
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,160
After An's son died,

379
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,560
Luo Bing didn't ask her
to return the property for six years.

380
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,200
His intentions were clear.

381
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,200
How can you solely believe Zou's story?

382
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,240
Send this case back for retrial.

383
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,760
Yes, Mr. Shen.

384
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,560
- Official Xia.
- Yes.

385
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,000
The case of an uncle
who kicked his nephew out of the family

386
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,800
and then seized his property
also requires further investigation.

387
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,560
Yes.

388
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,960
- I'll take my leave.
- I'll take my leave.

389
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,440
Mr. Shen, the Kaifeng Court
lacks an official

390
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,320
in charge of judicial matters.

391
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,120
There has been a pileup of cases recently,
and I have sent someone to urge.

392
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,640
The Ministry of Personnel says
the new official will come soon.

393
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,080
Understood.

394
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,520
You should also go rest.

395
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,760
Yes.

396
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,080
The medicine has been
warmed up twice already.

397
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,880
Huizhao, you've scared those two just now.

398
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,640
Why?

399
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,520
They report once every ten days.

400
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,840
And they get scolded hard each time.

401
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,880
They're drenched in sweat and need someone
to support when leaving the court.

402
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,960
I heard from Qingshi that Judge Fang
has asked for leave six times already.

403
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,040
Was I that scary before?
Just like a monster?

404
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,240
Why are they so scared of me?

405
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,520
You were not a monster

406
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,560
but cold and ruthless like chill iron.

407
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,760
You can even scare the children
to stop crying at night.

408
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,800
Then, why aren't you scared of me?

409
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,480
There are many people in the yamen.

410
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,200
Do not wander around.
Take good care of Leshan.

411
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,600
<i>She has been out of sight for a while now.</i>

412
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,040
<i>Don't bother asking.</i>

413
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,720
Bitter.

414
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,440
SIFU HOUSE

415
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,040
Let me tell you.
When I first went to the Shen family,

416
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,560
I was afraid I couldn't sleep,
so I brought some sedative incense.

417
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,360
Look, they have come in handy now.

418
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,480
And then I…

419
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,040
You are so naughty.

420
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,880
How dare she cause us trouble.

421
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,240
I have to show her what I got.

422
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,720
How arrogant you are.

423
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,760
You are really incredible and bold.

424
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,600
- You little troublemaker.
- Mom.

425
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,400
You were supposed to
look after your sister.

426
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,440
All you do is cause trouble.
What's wrong with you?

427
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,040
What's wrong with you?

428
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,280
- What's wrong with you?
- Mom.

429
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,240
What?

430
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,480
That mean old lady

431
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,160
bullied Haode first.

432
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,400
I've showed her some mercy.

433
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,080
Next time, I'll take a sewing needle
to stitch up her mouth.

434
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,120
I'll shut you up first.

435
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,880
- How dare you!
- Mom.

436
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,720
- How dare you!
- Stop.

437
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,200
What's wrong?

438
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,640
PAN RESTAURANT

439
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,400
What's wrong? Did you see something?

440
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,280
You see.

441
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,840
Who is she, acting so secretive?

442
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,280
She's asking you. Tell us.

443
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,600
It's naturally a noble lady

444
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,360
who's different from us

445
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,320
in every possible way.

446
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,800
Why are you scaring me?

447
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,000
Haode.

448
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,400
You're not the same
as you were before now.

449
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,880
You are obsessing with
resolving the cases all day.

450
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,960
- What's there to look at?
- You've finally come back.

451
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,640
- Where's fourth brother-in-law?
- He was taken away by Judge Fang.

452
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,760
Let me tell you.
Recently, I've been working

453
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,160
on these cases with Huizhao.
I found it quite interesting.

454
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,360
Look.

455
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,840
This one is the case of three brothers
disputing over land,

456
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,840
lasting for 25 years. Even their grandsons
are still suing each other.

457
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,720
If you read many of these court arguments,

458
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,160
I bet your quick wits

459
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,520
- would be more--
- Stop.

460
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,240
Now, when I hear any lawsuit,
my head starts to ache.

461
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,960
Haode.

462
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,880
I have a big secret to tell you.

463
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,880
What is it?

464
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,280
Let me tell you.

465
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,160
Really?

466
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,080
My lady.

467
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,200
My lady, go check your room. Madam is…

468
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,280
My lady, I tried to stop them,
but I can't.

469
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,960
My lady, please go and see.

470
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,160
Aunt, why are you
searching through my room?

471
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,640
I have been wearing a string
of agarwood beads since I was a child,

472
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,240
which was blessed
by Master Fuji of Xiangguo Temple

473
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,120
to bless me safe.

474
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,120
But it is missing.

475
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,080
I have reported to the Old Lady.

476
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,600
The entire mansion
must be searched thoroughly.

477
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,360
It's in here.

478
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,000
You are really from a humble family.

479
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,960
How foolish.

480
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,080
<i>She framed us so blatantly,</i>

481
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,200
<i>not pretending anymore,</i>
<i>this vicious old woman.</i>

482
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,560
Madam, please
don't make it difficult for my lady.

483
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,680
I picked it up

484
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,120
in the garden by chance.

485
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,160
I thought it was Mr. Shen's.

486
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,000
I didn't know it's your treasured item.

487
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,160
Please forgive me, Madam.

488
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,240
You can't even distinguish
your Master's items.

489
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,960
If you didn't steal it,
then you'd be so confused.

490
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:36,240
You caused a big commotion
and worried the Old Lady.

491
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,200
Haode.

492
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,680
Do you think
this maid deserves to be punished?

493
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,480
- Aunt, actually--
- I made a mistake.

494
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm willing to accept the punishment.

495
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,200
It's good then.

496
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,760
She's my maid.
You'd better let me do the punishment.

497
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,440
Madam, please forgive me.

498
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,240
I had this strange illness
since childhood.

499
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,360
I feel itchy being hit,
and I laugh when I feel itchy.

500
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,120
I didn't mean it.

501
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,520
Thank you for punishing me.

502
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,040
You mad maid!

503
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,520
- Give it to me.
- Aunt.

504
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,320
An unintentional mistake
deserves punishment,

505
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,000
intentionally stealing
gets punished more.

506
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,640
You discipline my maid so harshly.

507
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,720
If one day someone from your side
makes a mistake,

508
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,120
I hope you will be that harsh.

509
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,440
What do you mean?

510
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,680
I mean,

511
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,560
I'm afraid your hand would get hurt,
and it's not worth it.

512
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,800
Coming from a humble family,
you don't know the rules.

513
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,000
If it were my maid, she would have been
dragged out for a beating long ago.

514
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,480
Today, I just give you
a slight punishment.

515
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,960
Should she offend again,
she will not be let off easily.

516
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,800
My lady, it's all my fault

517
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,920
for not stopping her.

518
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,920
Huizhao will be back soon.
Hurry up and tidy up the room.

519
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,160
Yes.

520
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,160
Hand.

521
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,160
Hurry.

522
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,080
- Does it hurt?
- It's nothing.

523
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,120
You should have just admitted
you are my younger sister.

524
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,760
Let's see if she dares to hit you then.

525
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,920
If I admitted it, it would be inconvenient
for me to act here.

526
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,440
Then why were you laughing?

527
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,240
If I didn't laugh,

528
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,320
I might reach out
to pull off her wig then.

529
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,920
Haode, she's framing us boldly.

530
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,880
Can you stand that?

531
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,840
It's not gold or jade
but just a string of wooden beads.

532
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,480
I think she just wanted
to make me some trouble.

533
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:12,680
We must think of a way to keep her down,
so she won't dare to bully others again.

534
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,960
However, she is my aunt.

535
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,040
We can't fight her head-on
but only outwit her.

536
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,200
Come.

537
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,000
Good, amazing. Let's do that.

538
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,280
PAN RESTAURANT

539
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,960
Guiniang.

540
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,120
Mr. Wu.

541
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,320
Mother restricts me so much, I'm afraid
I may not be able to come out again.

542
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,720
Let's get to the point. Do you have
any plans to get to marry me now?

543
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,360
I've pleaded with my parents
to go for a marriage proposal.

544
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,160
But when the matchmaker
went to your house,

545
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,680
she was kicked out by your father.

546
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,160
He said you've been
engaged to the Xu family.

547
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:17,040
My parents were so angry and arranged
an engagement with the Lu family for me.

548
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,440
At this point,

549
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,600
I can't figure out any plan.

550
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,960
Go in there.

551
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,760
Mother.

552
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,400
You lowly lecher!

553
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,200
How dare you be so shameless
to seduce my daughter again!

554
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,520
I'll break your legs today.

555
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,920
- Mother.
- I'll break--

556
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,080
Don't. Mother. Don't.

557
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,720
- Don't.
- How dare you seduce my daughter.

558
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,760
Mother.

559
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,480
- Don't hit him.
- You did that?

560
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,120
Mother.

561
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,040
- Don't try to run.
- Mother.

562
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,960
Mother.

563
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,800
Mother. Don't hit him.

564
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,840
Mother.

565
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
Don't.

566
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,560
- Don't hit him, Mother.
- Stop right here.

567
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,560
- Mother.
- I'll beat you up.

568
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,040
- How dare you!
- Don't.

569
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,480
Don't hit him. Mr. Wu, run!

570
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,600
What's going on here?

571
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,320
- Don't run.
- Mr. Wu, run!

572
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,280
Auntie?

573
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,280
I wonder why this building
is surrounded by people

574
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,200
and all bystanders
get chased away completely.

575
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,720
So, it's you here catching a thief.

576
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,720
Why didn't you tell me?

577
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,680
My third brother-in-law
owns this Pan Restaurant.

578
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,960
If you had told me earlier,
I could have helped you.

579
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,240
Was that person who just went by a thief?

580
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,640
I wonder what precious thing
you have lost this time.

581
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,320
Mother, it was my own will.

582
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,600
Just let Mr. Wu go.

583
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,360
You useless brat!

584
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,760
You've disgraced me.

585
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,920
What's wrong with her?

586
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,360
Are you okay? Go fetch some water.

587
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,320
Yes.

588
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,080
Freshen up before going downstairs.

589
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,400
Haode.

590
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,800
What's wrong?
You seem distracted all evening.

591
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,560
Brother, I have done something.

592
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,040
Something a little wicked.

593
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,520
How wicked is it?

594
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,720
Haode, terrible.
Something bad happened to Guiniang.

595
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,840
Guiniang, give it to me.

596
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,160
Are you trying to drive me to death?

597
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,200
Huizhao.

598
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,840
Uphold justice for me.

599
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,960
I'm going to sue him,
that son of the Wu family,

600
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,760
for defiling the lady
of an official family

601
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,480
and disgracing my family's reputation.

602
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,960
I will never let him go.

603
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,160
Mother, if you want to sue, then do it.

604
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,840
If anything happens to him,
I will also go with him.

605
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,880
- You!
- Aunt.

606
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,680
It's late at night.
Don't scare the grandmother.

607
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,600
If you want to sue someone,
then you need to explain it in detail.

608
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,320
Come with me to the study to discuss this.

609
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,520
Someone.

610
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,280
Aunt, please.

611
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,680
Guiniang, this is all my fault.

612
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,320
I shouldn't hold grudges against
your mother and drag you into it.

613
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,040
It's all my fault.

614
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,880
Sooner or later, this would happen.

615
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,360
The Wu and Qiu families live next door
to each other.

616
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,560
Mr. Wu and I grew up together.

617
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,560
We've fallen for each other and have been
seeing each other for a long time.

618
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,160
But there is no secret that doesn't leak.

619
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,200
The Xu family has heard of this matter,

620
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,400
but they have never had proof.

621
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,080
Mother brought me here

622
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,600
just to force me to end this relationship.

623
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,280
Hearing what you said,

624
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,000
the Wu and Qiu families
are considered equal in status.

625
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,880
And you two are really in love.

626
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,680
Why don't they permit your marriage?

627
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,360
Sorry about that.

628
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,040
This is my younger sister. She's naughty.

629
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,680
She often disguises herself.

630
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,760
No wonder you don't act like a maid.

631
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,040
Several years ago,

632
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,280
when my grandfather
was still an imperial censor,

633
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,960
he impeached Mr. Wu's father.

634
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,800
There is a deep rift
between the two families.

635
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,440
They will never resolve their grievances

636
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,760
because of us two.

637
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,960
If Aunt

638
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,400
refuses to let you two marry,

639
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,760
- then--
- If he doesn't abandon me,

640
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,360
then I won't leave him.

641
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,360
If she insists me to submit,

642
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,720
I can only seek death.

643
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,200
These delicate noble young ladies
are saying to seek death easily.

644
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,760
To seek death over a marriage,
is it really worth it?

645
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,680
But she does look quite pitiful.

646
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,520
Let's help her.

647
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,480
I thought you hate her mother very much.

648
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,400
When parents do evil deeds,

649
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,440
their children shouldn't be implicated.
I am forgiving.

650
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,080
Okay, what a forgiving girl.

651
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,120
Where are you going?
I haven't finished talking yet.

652
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,360
Huizhao, this cream dessert is so smooth.
It's very sweet and fragrant.

653
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,920
I learned how to make it
from the chef of Pan Restaurant.

654
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,640
Straining the milk took quite an effort.

655
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,360
I know you have a sweet tooth.

656
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,280
I added a lot of icing sugar to it.

657
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,640
Who said I have a sweet tooth?

658
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,560
Huizhao, are you tired
from reading so long?

659
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,320
I'll give you a massage
to help you relax and ease up.

660
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,280
What do you want? Spit it out.

661
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,040
Tell me.

662
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,280
If Guiniang can't marry Mr. Wu,

663
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,040
- she would seek death.
- Ridiculous.

664
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,680
The marriage must involve a matchmaker.
It is the parents who decide the marriage.

665
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,760
I hate those
who don't cherish their lives the most.

666
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,360
Tell her to give up.

667
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,520
But our marriage involved
a matchmaker and a betrothal.

668
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,560
It was parents who decided our marriage.
Then why didn't you just accept me?

669
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,520
Slow down.

670
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,360
Huizhao.

671
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,880
Guiniang is your cousin.

672
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,200
Do you really want
to force her to seek death?

673
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,080
Just help her out.

674
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,360
Huizhao.

675
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,040
Just say yes. Huizhao.

676
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,080
It's too late.

677
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,280
Aunt has quite a temper.
This matter won't be hidden.

678
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,480
I'm afraid this matter has been spread
to the Xu family.

679
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,480
They will not let this go.

680
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,800
KAIFENG COURT

681
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,120
Huizhao, Guiniang has been crying
day and night.

682
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,600
While we can still do something about it,
why don't you persuade your aunt?

683
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,520
Stop it. This is not for you to handle.

684
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,320
Well, I have handled so many things
that were not for me.

685
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,120
Why not this?

686
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,560
- Huizhao.
- Let me go.

687
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,720
- Let me go.
- Just help them.

688
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,800
Sir, the new official has arrived.
He's in there.

689
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,040
Come on.

690
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,800
Mr. Shen.

691
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,120
It's been a while.

692
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,120
Eldest brother-in-law.

693
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,480
Please.

694
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,400
I've just returned
and I received the transfer order,

695
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,120
saying the Kaifeng Court is short of staff
and the cases are piling up.

696
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,280
I had been urged
to take the position immediately.

697
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,320
So, here I am.

698
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,080
Sorry for not having the chance

699
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,800
to inform Mr. Shen in advance.

700
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,880
Mr. Du comes at a perfect time.

701
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,800
There's a tough case for you.

702
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,240
Back then,
Mr. Du accused against his father,

703
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,880
and you insisted on sentencing him
to death in the imperial court.

704
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,360
Everyone knows you two are enemies.

705
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,760
Why would you transfer him here?

706
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,520
Is that so?

707
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,720
Hold court trial!

708
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,320
Mr. Du, the Qiu, Wu, and Xu families
are all either rich or noble.

709
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,480
As the officials' relatives involved,
they requested to listen in private rooms.

710
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,880
Please allow the steward to stand in court
and respond on their behalf.

711
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,120
Nonsense!

712
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,520
Once a writ has been filed,
it becomes a formal lawsuit.

713
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,080
According to the law of the Song,

714
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,640
even imperial relatives
must come for the trial.

715
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,120
Get both the plaintiff
and the defendant here

716
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,680
- to attend the trial.
- Yes.

717
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,080
Well…

718
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,080
Who is the plaintiff?
Who is the defendant?

719
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,880
- I'm the plaintiff.
- I'm the plaintiff.

720
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,440
- I'm the plaintiff.
- I'm the plaintiff.

721
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,080
My lord,

722
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,560
my husband's family name is Qiu.

723
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,640
We have a daughter named Guiniang,

724
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,760
who's 18 years old and has been
meticulously raised since childhood.

725
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:14,840
My husband and I hope her
to marry a fine man.

726
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,840
But the son of the Wu family
took advantage of our families' proximity

727
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,440
and defiled my daughter.

728
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,160
I am the plaintiff.

729
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,280
I want to sue the son of the Wu family
for adultery.

730
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,240
She can't discipline her daughter,

731
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,920
yet she wrongfully accused my son.

732
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,320
Separated by high walls,
with a deep courtyard,

733
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,640
you can never tell
who held the ladder to ask somebody in

734
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,560
and who held the lantern
to guide others into the room.

735
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,400
My son is just a frail scholar.

736
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,080
He can never leap onto roofs.

737
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,960
My lord, the shrew broke my son's legs.

738
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,000
- I want to accuse her of hurting my son.
- You!

739
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,360
Our Xu family presented a betrothal
through a matchmaker.

740
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,520
The gift has been delivered.

741
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,760
Qiu Guiniang
is my Xu family's daughter-in-law.

742
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,720
But the Qiu family allows
their daughter's adultery

743
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,640
and hides the truth.

744
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,760
My lord, I'm accusing Qiu Guiniang of
adultery with the son of the Wu family.

745
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,840
I am the plaintiff.

746
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,440
- I am the plaintiff.
- I am the plaintiff.

747
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,360
- I am.
- I am the plaintiff.

748
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,360
- I--
- Stop it. Shut up.

749
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,320
- My lord, I'm the plaintiff.
- I'm the plaintiff.

750
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,280
- I am the plaintiff.
- I am the plaintiff.

751
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,960
- I am.
- I am the plaintiff.

752
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,400
My lord.

753
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,320
- Court is adjourned.
- I am the plaintiff.

754
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,400
My lord.

755
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,840
- I am the plaintiff.
- I am the plaintiff.

756
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,440
The one causing trouble
in court is really Aunt?

757
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,440
Why doesn't she care about
her reputation at all?

758
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,240
All for her daughter.

759
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,360
You've seen the marriage law.

760
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,920
How is the adultery judged?

761
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,880
Male and female are each sentenced
to a year and a half of penal servitude.

762
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,480
If married, the female adulterer shall be
sentenced to two years.

763
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,440
Correct.

764
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,720
If Aunt does not accuse the Wu family,
the Xu family will not let her off.

765
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,040
Once the adultery is confirmed,

766
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,440
even if Guiniang
could escape imprisonment,

767
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,160
she can't avoid being flogged
in the court.

768
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,400
A lady getting stripped and flogged
in public

769
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,600
is much harder to endure than death.

770
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,760
When life is at stake,
reputation is no longer a concern.

771
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,440
Mr. Shen, you gave me a tough job.

772
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,240
One shrew is fine.

773
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,600
But there were three of them.

774
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,960
Is this case easy to judge?

775
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,560
Mr. Du, the one who filed the suit
is my aunt.

776
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,360
I have to avoid it.

777
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,160
Everyone knows you judge cases
only by the law but not the person.

778
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,800
His Majesty agreed you don't need to avoid
judging cases related to your family.

779
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,200
What? Encountering three women suddenly

780
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,280
makes it difficult for you too?

781
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,400
Mr. Du, how do you intend
to judge this case?

782
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,120
Although this case is complicated,
it's not difficult to judge.

783
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,880
The Qiu family shall return
all the betrothal gifts to the Xu family.

784
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,680
The son of the Wu family
and the daughter of the Qiu family

785
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,040
privately dated,
violating the marriage law.

786
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,120
Both shall receive 15 strokes
of the cane on the back

787
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,520
and cannot be married. Ask their families
to take them back for discipline.

788
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,120
Mr. Shen, what do you think?

789
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,640
Do they have to receive the caning?

790
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,960
Let's do it.

791
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,680
