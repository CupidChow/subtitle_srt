EPISODE 18

2
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,920
Who would have thought
Mr. Du was such a person?

3
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,600
Completely ruined Shouhua.

4
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,840
Such a good lady.

5
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,160
Deqing.

6
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,760
Kangning left something behind
when she left.

7
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,480
Go fetch it.

8
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,600
Yes.

9
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,160
What's this?

10
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,800
The Minister's son-in-law has come
to deliver a wedding invitation?

11
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,600
Wedding invitation?

12
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,800
Got rid of the wife of humble origin.

13
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,160
You will soon marry
the Minister's precious daughter.

14
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,920
Being victorious in the officialdom.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,200
In the bridal chamber,
you are a groom once more.

16
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,480
There is a smooth and broad path
ahead of you.

17
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,680
It can be said
to have fulfilled a lifelong ambition.

18
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,960
BLESSING FROM HEAVEN

19
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,080
Congratulations.

20
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,720
Chai,

21
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,000
my mother has lived in the Li family
for a long time. The clothes, food,

22
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,480
and money sent over
were all returned exactly as they were.

23
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,800
Would you trouble yourself

24
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,880
to pass the silver to Shouhua?

25
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,920
She won't accept your things.

26
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,160
That's her integrity.

27
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,200
I cannot ruin her principles.

28
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,640
No matter how poor the Li family may be,

29
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,800
they could still support one person.
Even if the Li family can't,

30
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,960
I am still here.

31
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,320
I definitely won't let her be angered
to death by that un-filial son.

32
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,400
So, there's no need for you
to trouble yourself.

33
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,240
Shouhua.

34
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,200
- How is she?
- Du Yangxi.

35
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,800
Even now, I still can't understand.

36
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,760
With your talent and ability, you would
have had your day of great success.

37
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,080
Why in such a hurry

38
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,040
to give up your wife
and go to the Yu family?

39
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,360
Could wealth and riches
move your heart so easily?

40
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,120
It's just that you've misjudged me.

41
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,320
I have always been someone
who chases fame and fortune,

42
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,560
an ungrateful villain.

43
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,440
Shouhua is beautiful, smart,
talented, and virtuous.

44
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,360
Although we were only together
for a short three months,

45
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,440
it was the greatest blessing of my life.

46
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,600
Ultimately, I am without conduct
and virtue, unworthy of her.

47
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,680
Today, I have come to you

48
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,440
with only one thing to ask.

49
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,880
You are the third-ranked scholar.

50
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,720
A future distinguished guest
of Minister Yu's.

51
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,080
An esteemed standing
before the officialdom.

52
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,120
Too many people want to flatter you.

53
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,320
There's no need to seek help
from a businessman like me.

54
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,400
You are overestimating me.

55
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,720
Chai,

56
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,680
those who flatter and fawn,

57
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,200
I disdain to associate with them.

58
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,120
But now that it's come to this point,
my mother refuses to acknowledge me.

59
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,520
Even my sworn brothers
want to cut ties with me.

60
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,520
In this vast world,
I find no kin upon looking up

61
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,360
and no longer
have anyone reliable to trust.

62
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,360
Chai,

63
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,400
please help me.

64
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,680
- Say it.
- The words I speak tonight

65
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,800
leave my mouth and enter your ears

66
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,320
with no third person hearing.

67
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,200
Even if it's your beloved wife,

68
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,040
you must not reveal
even a single word to her.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,040
Chai, can you do it?

70
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,080
After it's done,

71
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,120
I'll still trouble you

72
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,760
to collect my remains, arrange my burial,

73
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,600
and settle my spirit.

74
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,080
Look at this. It's really beautiful.

75
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,720
This is also beautiful.

76
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,200
Shouhua, look at these mandarin ducks.

77
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,560
They're just like the real ones.

78
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,840
Fuhui,

79
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,840
look at these twin babies on this sieve.

80
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,400
What a good omen.

81
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Indeed, well-made.

82
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,240
How much for this sieve?

83
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,760
Thirty-five coins.

84
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,600
Take another look at the floater.

85
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,640
The Cowherd and the Weaving Maiden,
only 15 coins.

86
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,240
- It's the First Lady from the Li Family.
- Everyone says a virtuous wife is good.

87
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,160
It can't compare to a rich
and honored future.

88
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,760
Even great benevolence is discarded.

89
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,520
How pitiful.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,560
I'm feeling dizzy from the heat.
I'll wait for you in the carriage.

91
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,040
Shouhua.

92
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,320
Shouhua has such a strong-willed nature.

93
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,240
How can she tolerate idle gossip?

94
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,360
Even it doesn't reach her ears,

95
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,360
a bit of wind would make her nauseate.

96
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,480
The faithless one remarries in splendor.

97
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,080
Yet Shouhua hides and skulks around.

98
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,720
Truly infuriating.

99
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,480
Shouhua's skin is not as thick as yours.

100
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,960
People's words are truly fearsome.

101
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,280
My lady.

102
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,520
What are you doing here?

103
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,880
I'll call for help.

104
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,680
I followed the Li family's carriage from
a distance just to return an old item.

105
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,240
Now that you've returned it, leave.

106
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,320
I know that matchmakers
have visited the Li family again.

107
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,080
Those who have approached the Li family
are all not from good families.

108
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,360
That Mr. Zhao from Lushi Street
has a favored maid at home.

109
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,240
His wife hung herself out of anger.

110
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,520
He is now hastily seeking a new wife
to cover the scandal.

111
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,760
And there's the son from the Liu family

112
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,600
who failed the exams multiple times.

113
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,400
Seeing me pass the exam after marriage,

114
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,440
he hopes you could help him
pass the imperial examination as well.

115
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,040
My lady.

116
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,240
None of these people are worth entrusting.

117
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,200
I hope you won't make a mistake.

118
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,680
Du Yangxi,

119
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,160
my thoughts were misguided.

120
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,160
A lifetime vow, to be
forever intertwined like water plants.

121
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,560
I will follow you through water
and stay with you through fire.

122
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,400
I know you have
a dangerous task to undertake.

123
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,000
Can I accompany you?

124
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,520
If you had spoken
these words to me sooner,

125
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,720
I would have been so happy.

126
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,840
It's just this time,

127
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,760
I can't take you with me.

128
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,080
The words I just spoke,
I hope you will remember them.

129
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,280
If you don't allow me to follow you,

130
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,400
then let me help you.

131
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,080
A climber of the powerful,

132
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,440
disrespectful, un-filial,
unfaithful, and fickle.

133
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,640
A man who divorces and remarries.

134
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,040
How dare you
rashly critique my marriage affairs?

135
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,400
Even if I choose any one of the illiterate
peddlers or servants to marry

136
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,720
once I leave this street, I'd still be 100
times better than you, a faithless man.

137
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,600
Since we are already divorced,

138
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,800
we have no further entanglements.

139
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,280
Please step aside quickly.

140
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,360
Don't block my way.

141
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,280
Go on then. Don't bring bad luck.

142
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,400
Let's go.

143
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,080
My lord.

144
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,080
We are soon to be one family.

145
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,240
There's no need for such formalities.

146
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,920
Yuanming.

147
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,360
Please sit.

148
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,440
Serve the tea.

149
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,880
Have all the matters at home
been properly dealt with?

150
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,760
I heard that Lady Li
is both beautiful, talented,

151
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,120
virtuous, and good-mannered.

152
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,760
You were a harmonious and happy couple.

153
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,160
Sadly, my daughter is willful
and my spouse indulges her,

154
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,080
leading to complications
at a critical moment and leaving regrets.

155
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,600
Now that things have come to this,
do you harbor any resentment, Yuanming?

156
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,640
I am but a humble scholar who has received
your grace without being forsaken.

157
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,720
To marry your beloved daughter, it must be
predestined affinity from a previous life,

158
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,880
only to rectify errors in this life.

159
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Since it is the will of heaven
and cannot be defied,

160
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,440
how dare I hold any grudges?

161
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,680
You have really been wronged.

162
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,520
Please sit down.

163
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,760
This matter has caused you and your mother
to turn against each other.

164
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,200
It also causes me much unease.

165
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,880
After all, in this world,
it's common to change wives,

166
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,520
but who has ever heard of someone
changing their own mother?

167
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,920
Moreover, she is your stepmother
who has shown you great kindness.

168
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,680
My wife is short-sighted.
You cannot comply with her in everything.

169
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,160
If your stepmother
refuses to attend the ceremony,

170
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,560
you must still kneel and entreat again.
Only then would it be proper filial piety.

171
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,040
Yes.

172
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,920
I will prudently follow your instruction.

173
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,560
Your stepmother saved my life.

174
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,080
She nurtured a person to be capable.

175
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,560
She is generous and righteous.

176
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,320
She is truly an exemplary model for women.

177
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,720
After you get married,
you should also bring her here.

178
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,000
Honor her even more
than your birth mother.

179
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,680
I shall also request her as a Noble Lady

180
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,920
as recompense for her kindness

181
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,800
and illuminating your virtue.

182
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,560
In the future, it will certainly
be a beautiful story among people.

183
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,120
Sir, you deeply understand righteousness.

184
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,160
I am moved to tears with gratitude.

185
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,400
I thank you profoundly
on behalf of my stepmother.

186
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,480
Still so aloof.

187
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,080
I pay my respects to Mr. Taishan.

188
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,440
You may stand up.

189
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,000
That's more like it.

190
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,040
Get out.

191
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,360
All sorts of disreputable people
come to propose marriage.

192
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,040
It dirties my mouth even to speak of it.

193
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,680
Go. Don't come knocking at my door again.

194
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,040
You don't know what's good for you.

195
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,440
What do you think
all my hardships have been for?

196
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,000
Is it not because I pity your daughter
who was abandoned?

197
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,720
Take the chance while you're young
and people still propose.

198
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,520
Wait until you're old and not attractive.

199
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,960
Even you pay a huge dowry
to be a stepmother,

200
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,120
no one will want you.

201
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,480
You stink like dog fart.

202
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,600
You're helping those scoundrels
to cheat my daughter.

203
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,280
You're still spouting nonsense?

204
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,120
If I don't tear your mouth apart,

205
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,040
you think I am soft, don't you?

206
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,880
- Stop. I'm going to tear your mouth.
- Mother.

207
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,040
These people talk in a misleading way.
Concealing the bad without mentioning it.

208
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,840
- Don't get angry.
- We don't need you to propose.

209
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,320
She's shaming you to your face.

210
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,960
Do you think you're an immortal?

211
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,640
Picked up a third-ranked scholar, your
ancestral grave emitting green smoke!

212
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,920
There's not another Jinshi
in the world for you to choose.

213
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,480
You gossip monger, dare to say
another word and see what happens.

214
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,960
I'll hit you.

215
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,360
Throw her out.

216
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
- Get out!
- Leshan.

217
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,080
I'd like to see

218
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,720
what kind of good son-in-law you can find.

219
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,480
Don't come back later begging me.

220
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,480
Tofu that's stewed until mushy
can't hold its shape.

221
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,760
Who's there?

222
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,600
Mr. Sang,
your timing is quite coincidental.

223
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,960
About Officer Liu's
granddaughter last time…

224
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,960
Madam Li, I've come in person

225
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,440
to propose marriage to Shouhua.

226
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,440
By doing this, you're deliberately making
it difficult for me, like the outsiders.

227
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,120
Before coming here,
I visited my foster mother.

228
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,280
Come.

229
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,880
Let me do it.

230
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,840
Listen to what they're saying inside.

231
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,760
Go.

232
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,360
- What did they say?
- They didn't speak.

233
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,280
- What do you mean?
- When I went inside,

234
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,440
I just gave them the two bowls of water.
I nodded and came out.

235
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
I want to listen too.

236
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,440
I asked my foster mother
about proposing to the Li family,

237
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,040
whether it would violate morality.

238
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,040
But my foster mother said…

239
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,240
<i>He and you have long been</i>
<i>separated by the end of an obligation.</i>

240
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,680
He and she are also separated
as a broken mirror and a halved hairpin.

241
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,880
If your two families are to be united,
whose principles would be violated?

242
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,160
And what morality
would it be going against?

243
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,800
I can get medical treatments

244
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,200
and food, all thanks to Shouhua.

245
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,600
If she doesn't get married,

246
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,120
in my heart,

247
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,800
shame and resentment
are hard to dissipate.

248
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,760
The illness gets worse day by day.

249
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,280
For the sake of me, this blind old woman,
and for her own sake,

250
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:48,600
I hope Shouhua doesn't waste the prime of
her life because of that un-filial child.

251
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,680
My mother-in-law has her insight.

252
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,000
But I have my own opinion.

253
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,800
If Mr. Sang wants to show pity,

254
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,320
there is no need to go this far.

255
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,320
No, it's not that.

256
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,440
I've said this to Yuanming,
but not everything.

257
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,240
I had planned to bury it
deep in my heart for life.

258
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,440
Never expected heaven to show mercy.

259
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,680
There's still a day
to confess my feelings to you.

260
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,520
Can't hear clearly.
What are they actually talking about?

261
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,080
I don't know.

262
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,280
- Mom, did you hear anything?
- No.

263
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,240
He's the new Jinshi
who just received the title of Archivist.

264
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,080
Absolutely must not miss him.

265
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,400
It's driving me mad.

266
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,320
Just accept him.

267
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,080
I accept you on behalf of Shouhua.

268
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,840
The marriage is settled.

269
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,360
Mother.

270
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,360
- Thank you, madam.
- No need to thank.

271
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,640
Shouhua.

272
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,080
This, this.

273
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,520
And this, and that.

274
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,080
- Put them all away.
- Okay.

275
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,600
What are you doing?

276
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,160
Our new brother-in-law
is not an ordinary person.

277
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,560
Shouhua, you can't wear makeup anymore.

278
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,920
Be careful
that he can't stand the fragrance.

279
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,680
Even you are teasing me.

280
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,280
I can no longer stay in this house.

281
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,880
Mom is preparing a banquet for
the future brother-in-law. I'll go help.

282
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,200
Shouhua.

283
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,040
Although it's said that when remarrying
one can decide for oneself.

284
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,840
But with Mom's hard attitude,
who can dissuade her?

285
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,360
Moreover, Mr. Sang is an upright person
with a distinguished appearance.

286
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,440
And he's just been granted
an honorable position.

287
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,560
Everyone outside praises him.
The Li family's fortune is turning around.

288
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,440
This is a great blessing.

289
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,400
It's a pity that…

290
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,280
- What?
- You are unwilling to marry him.

291
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,160
Kangning. Do you still remember
that small portrait before?

292
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,000
Was it the one that ended up
in the hands of Master Yang

293
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,880
and brought a calamity to the Li family?

294
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,760
<i>It was a fortuitously acquired</i>
<i>portrait from beyond this world.</i>

295
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,160
<i>I never leave it by my side, ever.</i>

296
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,840
<i>It was later taken away by a profligate.</i>
<i>I was still full of regrets.</i>

297
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,280
<i>Who would have known, that winter,</i>

298
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,280
<i>the paper beauty transformed into</i>
<i>a virtuous lady, appearing before my eyes.</i>

299
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,400
How numerous are the strange
happenings in this world?

300
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,760
Having lost the paper beauty,

301
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,040
yet gained a real wife.

302
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,080
After all the twists and turns,
it still belongs to him.

303
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,760
It shows that the will of heaven
cannot be defied.

304
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,000
Shouhua, I see this time,

305
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,920
even if you don't want to marry,
it won't work out.

306
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,840
I will not marry.

307
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,280
Something happened, Shouhua!

308
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,600
Madam Du had a phlegm seizure and fainted.

309
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,760
Madam.

310
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,440
She can't swallow a single sip.

311
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,720
Wasn't it said that
she was getting better yesterday,

312
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,800
that she was able
to get out of bed and walk around?

313
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,800
Why has she fainted again?

314
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,200
Have you been careless
in looking after her?

315
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,680
How would I dare to be?

316
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,800
It was just a slip of the tongue.

317
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,280
That's good news.

318
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,320
Was it about Shouhua's betrothal?

319
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,000
No, it's not.

320
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,000
It's the good news of Mr. Du's
impending marriage.

321
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,400
Upon hearing it,
Madam Du's face turned red.

322
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,400
She fainted in a fit of rage.

323
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,560
Madam Du still means well.

324
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,040
She is still indignant
on our family's behalf.

325
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,000
Such a pitiable sight.

326
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,920
Mother, are you alright?

327
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,920
Mother.

328
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,280
Are you okay, madam?

329
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,880
This…

330
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,480
This doesn't seem to be a phlegm seizure.

331
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,600
It looks like a stroke.

332
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,880
Sangma, you hurry

333
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,040
and call the physician.

334
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,960
Yes.

335
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,440
It's as if she has something

336
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,800
important to say.

337
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,640
Mother, what do you want to say?

338
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,720
Cannot…

339
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,640
Cousin, let's go.

340
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,640
YU RESIDENCE

341
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,200
Why did you drag me here?

342
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,880
Today's Mr. Du's wedding.
The Yu family has laid out a grand feast.

343
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,280
Scholars and nobles fill the hall.
A grand event in the capital.

344
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,880
- Don't you want to see the excitement?
- What's so exciting about it?

345
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,400
- I'll leave.
- Cousin.

346
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,080
He even dared to send us an invitation.

347
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,880
If we don't show,
won't it seem we're afraid?

348
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,600
We must go.

349
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,280
- Come on.
- Let go.

350
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,920
Cousin.

351
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,160
This time, our daughter
finally gets what she wishes.

352
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,800
It's all thanks to you.

353
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,920
My lord, madam.

354
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,880
The auspicious time has arrived.

355
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,280
Please, the newlyweds come forward
to perform the ceremony.

356
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,920
It has begun.

357
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Here they come.

358
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,560
A match of mythical birds,
a union made by heaven.

359
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,320
The newlyweds
first bow to heaven and earth.

360
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,160
This groom is so overjoyed
that he's all flustered.

361
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,760
Mr. Du, they're calling you
to bow to heaven and earth.

362
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,280
Exactly.

363
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,280
- Bow now.
- The groom is stunned.

364
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,680
Yes.

365
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,000
He's shy.

366
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,680
First bow to heaven and earth.

367
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,880
- What is this?
- Huh?

368
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,280
What on earth is this decorum?

369
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,960
Cousin, what's wrong with him?

370
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,680
Let's wait and see.

371
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,520
Mr. Du, what's happened?

372
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,120
I should indeed
pay my respects to the Minister.

373
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,920
Please accept Du Yangxi's three bows.

374
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,120
A lone humble scholar,
granted an official post.

375
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,040
All thanks to the Minister's promotion.

376
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,440
This first bow

377
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,640
is to Minister Yu's
generous recommendation.

378
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,560
Deeply grateful for this acquaintance.
I'm endlessly thankful.

379
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,240
My worthy son-in-law.

380
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,120
If you pay respects for your
father-in-law's favor,

381
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,960
a bow in the rear hall will suffice.

382
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,280
Where is it heard of leaving behind
the bride and guests

383
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,760
to bow alone here?

384
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,120
What are you trying to do?

385
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,800
The Minister has not only
lifted up this humble scholar,

386
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,680
but he bestowed his daughter in marriage.

387
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,400
Regrettably, I already have a wife.
I truly dare not accept the order.

388
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,120
Despite repeated polite refusals,
the Yu family stubbornly disallows.

389
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,680
Today, I have no choice but to
address it and offer my bows in farewell.

390
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,400
I have but limited abilities

391
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,600
and certainly cannot take lady Yu as wife.
I ask for your understanding, sir.

392
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,240
Du Yangxi, this is too much.

393
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,840
How can coercing into marriage
be acceptable?

394
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,840
Now this is just great.
How will the Yu family deal with this?

395
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,760
The daughter of Minister in marriage,
how is it coercion? It's clearly an honor.

396
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,520
Watch. Minister won't let him off easily.

397
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,640
This matter is not so simple.
Hold your tongue.

398
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,040
Mother.

399
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,240
- Mother.
- Don't be anxious.

400
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,440
Look.

401
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,720
Father.

402
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,760
Du Yangxi's refusal in the main hall
is immoral and disgraceful behavior.

403
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,720
Your daughter has been humiliated.

404
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,240
Father, you must
stand up for your daughter.

405
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,360
Du Yangxi.

406
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,720
Calm down.

407
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,800
I have my own plan.

408
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,200
Just now, Mr. Du said
there are three bows, right?

409
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,960
Then, what is the third bow for?

410
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,720
Our body and hair,
received from our parents.

411
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,120
The kindness of giving life,
as an ocean, is impossible to repay.

412
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,360
With this bow, I express my gratitude

413
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,560
for the benevolence
of being raised by my birth father.

414
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,000
What?

415
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,240
Birth father?

416
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,040
Birth father?

417
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,040
What did he say?

418
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,440
Who is his birth father?

419
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,600
Since when did Minister Yu
become his birth father?

420
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,960
Is this true or false?

421
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,160
Am I dreaming right now?

422
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,720
What nonsense are you talking about?

423
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,520
Who is your birth father?

424
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,200
Who are you?

425
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,840
Wasn't it said to be
the best physician in Bianjing?

426
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,480
Wasn't it guaranteed
to show improvement within three days?

427
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,840
It's been several times already.

428
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,640
But there's still no sign of improvement.

429
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,400
Mother.

430
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,720
This illness did not come about suddenly.

431
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,720
Coming three times costs a string.

432
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,480
A string of coins

433
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,720
is like a bottomless pit.
I can't hear any sound at all.

434
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,480
Madam.

435
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,960
She's awake now.

436
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,440
I heard the sound now.

437
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,320
May the Bodhisattva bless us.

438
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,520
- Mother.
- Thank you for the Bodhisattva's blessing.

439
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,560
Thank you, Bodhisattva.

440
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,320
I heard the sound. Thank you, Bodhisattva.

441
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,800
Thank you, Bodhisattva.

442
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,760
Thank you.

443
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,000
This is the medicine.
Take it with boiled water.

444
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,480
How much does it cost again?

445
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,520
- I don't want money.
- You don't?

446
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,360
Then give me a few more.

447
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,640
Thank you. Thank you so much.

448
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,640
See the physician out.

449
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,000
Thank you.

450
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,400
- Mother.
- This way.

451
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,840
I'm right here.

452
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,280
What do you want to say?

453
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,560
He is a biological child…

454
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,800
He can't…

455
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,880
What did you say?

456
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,160
Yu Weiyi.

457
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,080
Are you saying

458
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,400
Mr. Du is the biological son
of Minister Yu?

459
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,680
What?

460
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,080
Maid.

461
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,840
Quick. Help the young lady back first.

462
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,760
Hurry.

463
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,720
Mother.

464
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,320
Father.

465
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,160
Go quickly.

466
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,760
Knowing the Minister's
kindness and righteousness,

467
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,320
you shouldn't slander without evidence.

468
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,120
What about a third-ranked scholar?

469
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,840
Full of nonsense, completely ignorant
of propriety and righteousness.

470
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,120
Every word is wildly absurd.

471
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,440
It's simply unheard of.

472
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,480
Throw this madman out for me.

473
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,760
You…

474
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,040
Whether it's slander or not,
let's hear him out.

475
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,360
Why so terrified?

476
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,120
Could it be that the Yu family
really has something indecent

477
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,320
and dare not let the guests present know?

478
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,440
Exactly. Not letting one finish speaking,

479
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,120
isn't that a sign of guilt?
You can silence just one person's mouth,

480
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,360
but can you silence
the murmuring mouths here?

481
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,080
Where did these madmen come from?

482
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,040
Someone, throw them out.

483
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,800
Hurry. Tie them up.

484
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,920
Who dares?

485
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,120
Stop, all of you.

486
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,800
I have lived a life
of integrity and honesty

487
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,760
without guilt before heaven and earth.

488
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,520
Nothing shameful to hide from others.

489
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,720
Before I achieved success,

490
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,360
I had a first wife.

491
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,920
Unfortunately, she passed away early

492
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
and left no children.

493
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,280
Mr. Du repeatedly calls me father.

494
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,640
There must be some misunderstanding.

495
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,680
Thank you for your help.

496
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,440
However, this is something only I can do.

497
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,160
Please, Mr. Chai and Mr. Fan,

498
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,480
be witnesses for me.

499
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,320
Alright.

500
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,240
Twenty-eight years ago, a father and
daughter lived in Jiangling Prefecture,

501
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,800
making a living by running a pharmacy.

502
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,920
They also had
a few dozen acres of farmland.

503
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,360
They led a fairly decent life.

504
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,200
<i>That winter,</i>

505
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,640
<i>Mr. Xie carried back a destitute scholar</i>
<i>in the snowstorm.</i>

506
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,360
Young man, are you alright?

507
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,360
Sir?

508
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:20,360
<i>They fed him food, provided</i>
<i>medical treatment, and saved his life.</i>

509
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,600
XIE QIUFANG

510
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,160
<i>This young man, having lost</i>
<i>both parents, had nowhere to turn to.</i>

511
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
<i>Mr. Xie didn't mind his poverty,</i>

512
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,080
<i>treated him as his own son.</i>

513
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,560
<i>Even married</i>
<i>his only daughter Qiufang to him.</i>

514
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,640
<i>The couple were affectionate</i>
<i>and in harmony.</i>

515
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,200
<i>A beautiful pair, a perfect match.</i>

516
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,560
<i>And they were extremely filial</i>
<i>to their father.</i>

517
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,680
Unfortunately, heaven was not kind.

518
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,080
The following year
brought a devastating flood.

519
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,840
The villages and farmlands,
all waterlogged.

520
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,960
Mr. Xie, stricken with
sudden rage and angst, passed away.

521
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,000
<i>Fortunately, Xie's daughter</i>
<i>was virtuous, smart, and skillful.</i>

522
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,960
<i>She wove day and night without rest</i>

523
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,600
<i>and urged her husband to study hard.</i>

524
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,600
<i>To raise funds</i>
<i>for the examination expenses,</i>

525
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,080
<i>she did not hesitate</i>
<i>to sell herself as a maid for three years</i>

526
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,000
for the price of 120 strings.

527
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,440
- Everyone, please disperse.
- Please, go back.

528
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,560
- This way, please.
- Shall we leave?

529
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,080
- Please return.
- Take care.

530
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,880
- Let's go.
- Let's leave first.

531
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,400
Sorry for the inadequate hospitality.

532
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,920
Master Liu.

533
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,240
Master Li.

534
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,960
Master Wang.

535
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,120
Go out and wait for me.

536
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,280
You go out too.

537
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,800
I wonder

538
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,360
where did you learn all this?

539
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,520
Okay.

540
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680
Mr. Du.

541
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,000
I have never wronged her.

542
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,520
After winning the imperial examination,

543
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,280
I rushed back
to my hometown without stopping.

544
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,200
Finally, the couple was reunited.

545
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,480
After hardship comes happiness.

546
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
You have never failed Xie Qiufang.

547
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,480
Then how did she die?

548
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,960
That year, my lord
completed his term in Luzhou.

549
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,160
Xie accompanied him
to take up his post in Chizhou.

550
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,840
They encountered a storm on the way,

551
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,880
and Xie accidentally
fell into the water and died.

552
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,400
She had a short-lived fate.

553
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,080
Unfortunately, she met with this disaster.

554
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,600
Wasn't Xie Qiufang
pushed into the water by you?

555
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,520
What are you saying?

556
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,000
Isn't it so?

557
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,480
Back then,
when you were in office in Luzhou,

558
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,280
you cleared longstanding corruption
and released the innocent.

559
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,440
You aided the needy
with great political achievements.

560
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,000
You were to be called back to the capital.

561
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,600
Later, you were demoted
from Wangzhou to Shangzhou

562
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,080
because you refused a proposal
after your success in the exams.

563
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,640
You offended Liang Zhen.

564
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,600
Less than half a year
after the death of Xie,

565
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,440
you married a lady from the Liang family
and moved back to the capital soon after.

566
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,760
Since then, you have had
a smooth and rapidly rising career.

567
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,800
You have no proof
and are recklessly speculating.

568
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,960
If it spreads, how will outsiders
view the Yu and Liang families?

569
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,240
My Lord, you cannot allow him
to be presumptuous any longer.

570
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,280
It's nothing.

571
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,200
Why should I fear things
I have never done?

572
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,360
My father-in-law
has shown me deep kindness.

573
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,960
Qiufang was also deeply affectionate.

574
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,600
I reminisce
about my late wife with affection.

575
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,800
My resolve has not changed.

576
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,360
Heaven and earth
are witnesses to the truth.

577
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,200
I disdain to confess to a simpleton.

578
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,880
Rather, it is you, Du Yangxi.

579
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,880
You spout nonsense
and slander to the utmost.

580
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,800
What exactly is your purpose?

581
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,080
That's because you thought Xie was dead.

582
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,560
You think there is no witness
under heaven.

583
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,400
However, the way of heaven is clear,
retribution is certain.

584
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,280
Xie Qiufang sold herself as a maid.

585
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,480
At the Liu family,
she met a maid named Qian'er.

586
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,680
She saw that Qian'er was often humiliated.

587
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,840
When she left the Liu family,
she took Qian'er with her.

588
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,680
That night, Qian'er was also on the boat.

589
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,480
She heard a noise outside,

590
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,480
so she jumped down to save Xie.

591
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,440
Poor her, being small and weak,
how could she manage to save anyone?

592
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,440
The two were washed ashore by the waves.

593
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,120
From then on,
they became drifters in a foreign land.

594
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,000
Are you saying

595
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,320
Qiufang is still alive?

596
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,320
Then where is she now?

597
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,240
Is she doing well?

598
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,040
Xie Qiufang is already
three months pregnant.

599
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,240
The two temporarily
live in a small temple,

600
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,480
living by begging for food.

601
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,880
Months later, she gave birth to a son.

602
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,760
Xie passed away due to a serious illness.

603
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,440
It was the righteous maid Qian'er
who painstakingly raised the baby.

604
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,640
Could it be that you

605
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,720
are my son?

606
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,600
That's impossible.

607
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,480
Qiufang never mentioned it to me.

608
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,280
Seeing you repeatedly suppressed

609
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,320
in your official career,

610
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,680
fretting all day long,

611
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,760
she didn't tell you these things.

612
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,400
If we are indeed father and son by blood,

613
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,120
why didn't you tell me earlier?

614
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,520
You kept me in such painful ignorance.

615
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,040
Do you still remember

616
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,080
the scene of my mother
falling into the water?

617
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,240
<i>I braved the wind and waves to rush over.</i>

618
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,880
My lord.

619
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,760
<i>I wanted to save Qiufang.</i>

620
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,240
Save me.

621
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,640
<i>But I couldn't do it.</i>

622
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,240
My lord.

623
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,880
<i>I watched helplessly</i>
<i>as she was swept away by the water.</i>

624
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,720
<i>Even a maid knew</i>
<i>to sacrifice herself to save her master.</i>

625
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,640
<i>Why couldn't a husband save his wife?</i>

626
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,880
After the wind died down
and the waves subsided,

627
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,320
did you ever send out fishing boats
to retrieve the body?

628
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,080
After you were out of danger,

629
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,480
did you ever return along the route
to look for her,

630
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,960
or did you have someone
ask about her whereabouts?

631
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,960
That night, the storm was raging.

632
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,640
How could she, a frail woman, survive it?

633
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,160
No, you did not.

634
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,600
You watched her
as she was engulfed by the storm.

635
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,000
At that time,
you only felt relieved of a burden.

636
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,000
Because you were busy
trying to please the Liang family

637
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,640
and marry a new wife.

638
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,080
My foster mother, Qianniang, had someone
deliver a message to Chizhou.

639
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,760
But what came instead was an assassin.

640
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,440
In order to avoid disaster,
she chose to disfigure herself,

641
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,240
hiding her identity
and living in obscurity.

642
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,680
Didn't you see her that day as well?

643
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,960
Son, listen to me.

644
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,840
The hardships
you and your mother have suffered

645
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,440
are all because of the Liang family.

646
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,920
I did not kill your mother.

647
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,480
I also did not know of your existence.

648
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,560
Things have come to this and you still
think it's all the Liang family's fault?

649
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,080
Do you think
you have nothing to be blamed?

650
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,880
What wrong have I done?

651
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,320
Do you know

652
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,840
years of hard study

653
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,000
and achieving an official position
through hardships

654
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,960
is all for your mother's sake?

655
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,680
I was willing to offend the Liang family.

656
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,320
No matter how good I had been,

657
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,480
I was still demoted again and again.

658
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,760
Villages and towns under my rule
suffered locust plagues.

659
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,240
I requested six times
to open the granary for relief,

660
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,560
all obstructed by the Liang family.

661
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,240
Involving so many innocents,

662
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,000
how could I bear it in my heart?

663
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,880
Furthermore,

664
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,560
you blame me
for remarrying into the Liang family.

665
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,680
But whom else could I blame?

666
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,280
I can only blame the heavens
for being unjust to me.

667
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,240
My lord.

668
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,280
Is it you?

669
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,000
Who has been inciting you?

670
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,680
For so many years,

671
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,240
my foster mother
has sealed her lips tightly,

672
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,200
unwilling to reveal
my biological father's name.

673
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,480
Before I went to take the exams,

674
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,440
she even forced me to take an oath.

675
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,800
Even if we, father and son, meet again,

676
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,080
we shall act as strangers.

677
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,360
But there are a few words

678
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,880
I have no choice but to say on behalf of
my deceased maternal grandfather.

679
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,360
Twenty years ago,

680
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,800
the Liang family
relied on their power to oppress others

681
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,640
and forced you into marriage.

682
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,400
Twenty years later,

683
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,200
you willfully abused your power

684
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,440
and enticed me with benefits.

685
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,360
As the leader among the literati
and a mainstay of the imperial court,

686
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,680
yet you rely on your power
and betray the Emperor's grace.

687
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,000
This is disloyalty.

688
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,760
Mr. Xie

689
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,680
saved your life from the snowstorm

690
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,200
and even regarded you as his own child,

691
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,920
entrusting his only daughter
and estate to you.

692
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,080
But you were ungrateful
and forgetful of kindness.

693
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,520
You have betrayed a heavy trust.
This is un-filiality.

694
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,760
Xie Qiufang toils day and night,
supporting her husband for the exams.

695
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,880
Yet you abandoned her without a thought.

696
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,800
Setting aside your wife to remarry.
This is inhumanity.

697
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,360
As a father,

698
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,280
you failed to raise your son

699
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,920
and let him suffer hardships.
This is injustice.

700
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,160
Shut up.

701
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,440
You acknowledge me in the hall today

702
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,120
just to challenge your own father?

703
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,360
I do not wish to embarrass you.

704
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,320
It's just that as a son,

705
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,400
I have to ask you something on behalf

706
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,000
of my deceased mother once again.

707
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,280
What is it?

708
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,040
Oh, Yu.

709
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,680
On a snowy night,

710
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,480
the Xie family used a bowl of hot soup

711
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,320
to save a stranger.

712
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,120
But in the torrential river,

713
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,600
why were you unwilling

714
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,880
to save your wife

715
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,000
who has been
through thick and thin with you?

716
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,400
My lord.

717
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,120
I was just about to call someone
to rush to the Yu house.

718
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,640
Where is Mr. Du?

719
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,560
It's too late.

720
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,560
Too late? What do you mean "too late"?

721
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,000
Everything is too late.

722
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,120
My lady, Du Yuanming
has gone to the Kaifeng Court

723
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,280
to submit a complaint
and also to turn himself in.

724
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,120
<i>Before my mother died,</i>

725
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,240
<i>she only left one sentence.</i>

726
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,080
<i>Oh, Yu.</i>

727
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,360
<i>On a snowy night,</i>

728
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,160
<i>the Xie family used a bowl of hot soup</i>

729
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,440
<i>to save a stranger.</i>

730
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,240
<i>But in the torrential river,</i>

731
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,040
<i>why were you unwilling</i>

732
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,320
<i>to save your wife</i>

733
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,440
<i>who has been</i>
<i>through thick and thin with you?</i>

734
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,640
My lord.

735
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,920
Just a step away.

736
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,040
I could have grasped her hand.

737
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,520
I could have saved her.

738
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,280
Why did I hesitate at the last moment?

739
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,120
Why?

740
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,080
My lord, such big storm,

741
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,200
even the boatman met his end
in the belly of the fish,

742
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,800
let alone Xie Qiufang.

743
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,680
You have personally experienced dangers

744
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,120
and barely survived.

745
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,520
Being able to preserve your life

746
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,040
is already the blessing of heaven.

747
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,040
Why torment yourself?

748
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,120
I ask you.

749
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,840
The storm was an accident.

750
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,560
Were the assassins
sent by the Liang family also an accident?

751
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,680
My lord.

752
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,600
That Mr. Du is brainwashed by someone

753
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,080
and even dares to question
his own father publicly.

754
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,400
You don't teach your son properly

755
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,880
but blame your wife.

756
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,800
I am just a woman
who does not step out of the house.

757
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,080
Where can I go to hire a killer?

758
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,200
And I still suffer this injustice.

759
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,600
Whether it is or is not,

760
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,040
you know in your heart.

761
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,880
I have already submitted my resignation.

762
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,800
From now on, I will resign
and return to my hometown,

763
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:39,800
far from the court.

764
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,000
It cannot be.

765
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,320
My lord, you are
an important official in court.

766
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,560
How can you simply abandon your position?

767
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,480
You can't do this.

768
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,240
Then you tell me.
Why did he choose the wedding day

769
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,000
to reveal everything under heaven?

770
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,640
I understand now.

771
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,280
He had premeditated.

772
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,960
He wanted to make a public spectacle

773
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,080
and completely destroy the Yu family.

774
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,400
My lord, there must be a way.

775
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:15,280
Yes, he claims to be
the son of the Xie family.

776
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,920
But 20 years have passed,

777
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,360
and who can testify now?

778
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,840
As for that blind old beggar woman,
silencing her won't be difficult.

779
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,400
My lord,
we can't just sit and wait for doom.

780
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,600
I am just a woman.

781
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,000
Returning home is not impossible.

782
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,800
But my heartfelt speech is all for you.

783
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,480
In your purple robe and golden belt,
you are favored by the emperor.

784
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,720
How can you let a little brute
destroy everything, my lord?

785
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,720
To plead his mother's grievances,

786
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,480
he would rather sacrifice his own career.

787
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,760
Do you think he will give you

788
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,120
a way out?

789
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,160
I'm afraid
he has already gone to the court.

790
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,560
The paper from the Kaifeng Court

791
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,320
will soon be presented to the emperor.

792
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,200
Even if I don't take
the initiative to resign,

793
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,400
I'd be too ashamed
to remain at the heart of the court.

794
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,440
I advise you

795
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,560
not to bring shame upon yourself.

796
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,280
Furthermore,

797
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,560
it is I who will resign and return home.

798
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,360
As for you and your daughter,

799
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,040
you should take care of yourselves.

800
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,760
My lord, my lord.

801
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,720
My lord.

802
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,960
My lord.

803
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,240
My lord.

804
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,040
Yu Weiyi.

805
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,200
Who do you think you are?

806
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,880
Ungrateful
and abandoning your lawful wife.

807
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:34,960
It's all because of me

808
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,520
that you have high rank.

809
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,640
Now you regret and feel guilty.

810
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,680
Who are you putting on this act for?

811
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,960
Disgusting.

812
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,400
I dare to admit my own shamelessness.

813
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,160
Do you dare?

814
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,000
You're just a good-for-nothing.

815
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,240
Mom.

816
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,280
Mom.

817
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,160
Mom, what's wrong?

818
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,080
That Du has insulted me too much.

819
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,240
Father is now
the most esteemed among officials.

820
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,640
How can Du to be so presumptuous?

821
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,440
We must report to Ministry of Personnel
to dismiss him from his position.

822
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,320
Never let him serve
in office again till death.

823
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,560
And that Li family.

824
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,760
If I'd known today would've happened,

825
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:18,280
I would've let you do as you pleased,
to go hang yourself.

826
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,680
It's all over now.

827
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,760
It's all done.

828
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,600
