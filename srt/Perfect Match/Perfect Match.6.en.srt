00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,600
EPISODE 6

2
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,800
PAN RESTAURANT

3
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,560
I'm not exaggerating

4
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,240
about our Lady Wang.

5
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,960
Her beauty is beyond words.
She is also elegant and intelligent.

6
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,640
The flowers she embroiders
outshine the real ones.

7
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,400
It can even attract bees
and butterflies.

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,880
The fabric she weaves

9
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,800
is prettier than the rosy clouds.

10
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,920
How can someone be so graceful
and so skillful at the same time?

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,760
If you miss this chance, you'll have
to look in heaven for someone like her.

12
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,160
The Chai family owns thousands of acres
of land and hundreds of shops.

13
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,200
Wealth is not even worth mentioning.

14
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,160
In times of flood or drought,

15
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,280
they donate food
or repair bridges and roads.

16
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,120
They've given away
untold amounts of money and goods.

17
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,080
They are truly famous

18
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,480
for their generosity.

19
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,680
When we marry off our daughters,

20
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,560
we don't only look at wealth.

21
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,560
With talent like hers,

22
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,240
even if I had a thousand tongues,

23
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,640
I wouldn't be able to praise her enough.

24
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,520
Her good points are plain to see.

25
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,400
There's no need for me to say more!

26
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,920
A match made in heaven.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,880
Truly a match made in heaven.

28
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,160
Deqing.

29
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,880
I checked
their astrological compatibility,

30
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,720
and their birthdates
align perfectly for marriage.

31
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,120
Yes, yes, indeed.

32
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,400
This…

33
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,840
You…

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let's go.

35
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,480
An'er!

36
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,440
That Wang Shiba,
though from a military family,

37
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,040
she is well-versed in arts and etiquette
and is truly exceptional in every way.

38
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,800
She far outshines
those self-important officials.

39
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,120
She doesn't even care about your wealth.

40
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,320
She values your talent, above all.

41
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,800
Isn't she asking me to fund
her brother's honorary officer position?

42
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,040
You! Why are you so picky?

43
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,400
How many matches
have you dismissed in three years?

44
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,040
You're just trying
to make me unhappy on purpose.

45
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,320
Stop right there.

46
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,040
Do you even remember
your father's last wish?

47
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,520
Yes, I do.

48
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,920
Good that you remember.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,920
Alright, Mother. I've set my sights
on Li Kangning from the Li family.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,560
Get ready to arrange
the marriage proposal.

51
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,840
Which Li Kangning?

52
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,240
Who's this Li Kangning?

53
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,040
The one from across the street.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,360
Which family is that?

55
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,320
The family owns Sifu House.

56
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,320
Madam!

57
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,560
Madam!

58
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,080
Sir!

59
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,600
Sir!

60
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,240
My lady. It's the middle of the night.
Why aren't you asleep?

61
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,760
What's wrong?

62
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,280
Did you hear anything outside?

63
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,760
Listen closely!
Doesn't it sound like footsteps?

64
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,400
No, no, my dear.

65
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,960
Don't let your imagination run wild.

66
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,960
Those people have been arrested
and sent to the authorities.

67
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,280
How would they dare come back?

68
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,840
Who says so?

69
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,560
They just rested
at an old abandoned temple.

70
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,960
Did the interrogations
reveal their hideout?

71
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,080
Their leaders should all be arrested.

72
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,840
They will hold grudges to the death.

73
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,880
Well, they did uncover something.
I'll check with the officials tomorrow.

74
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,040
No, go ask them now.

75
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,640
I'm scared.

76
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,160
Please, just go now.

77
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,920
Get up, husband.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,320
Don't worry, my dear.

79
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,480
Before dawn,
the soldiers have raided their lair.

80
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,560
They are all caught.

81
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,320
My brother told me not to tell you.

82
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,520
Just sleep. Sleep now.

83
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,600
My lady. I was wrong, my lady!

84
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,600
I was wrong! It's all my brother's fault
for making me play the hero.

85
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,880
It's all his fault, my lady!

86
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,440
My lady! My lady!

87
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,120
Help! Help!

88
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,240
BETROTHAL LETTER

89
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,560
Mother! Shouhua!

90
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,600
Did you know that
the bandits even colluded with them?

91
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,760
Mother!

92
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,840
Is there any happy occasion
in the house today?

93
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,080
Two matchmakers are here
to arrange a marriage for Kangning.

94
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,000
That's wonderful!

95
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,520
They say fortune follows misfortune
and hardship brings prosperity.

96
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,760
Seems like that's true.

97
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,720
This is a blessing from the heavens.
Which family are they talking about?

98
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,200
What a coincidence!

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,880
It's the cousin of Fuihui's husband.

100
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,440
The young master of the Chai family.
The owner of Pan Restaurant.

101
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,200
It's the Chai family.

102
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,400
The Chai family?

103
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,120
Master Chai?

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,960
He admires

105
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,520
Kangning's virtue and beauty.

106
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,320
As for the dowry,

107
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,360
he hasn't even asked about it.

108
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,800
In all my years as a matchmaker,

109
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,480
this is the best match I've encountered.

110
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,800
You know, there are countless
mismatched marriages in the world.

111
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,280
A beautiful woman marrying a rough guy,
or a talented man with a foolish wife.

112
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,560
It's such a pity!

113
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,920
A match like yours,
with a gifted man and a beautiful woman,

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,520
is truly rare!

115
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,600
You must not miss this opportunity.
I've said all the good things I can.

116
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,120
If you're willing,
fill out this marriage agreement.

117
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,800
On such a good day,
we'll head back with your answer.

118
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,800
Why would the Chai family
come to propose marriage?

119
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,120
How could it be the Chai family?

120
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,000
I know,

121
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,400
it must be the Bodhisattva

122
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,960
who is touched by my sincere prayers.

123
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,840
They've sent an incredible blessing
to our family.

124
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,720
Thank you, Bodhisattva. Thank you.

125
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,800
Wait, no, no.

126
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,120
That's not right.

127
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,480
Kangning!

128
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,360
Can she really be this lucky?

129
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,160
It feels like a dream.

130
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,600
Pinch me, Shouhua!

131
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,640
You actually pinched me!

132
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,880
That hurt!

133
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,240
<i>Kangning, that night I rushed over,</i>

134
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,920
<i>I begged so many people</i>
<i>and even met some soldiers.</i>

135
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,240
<i>But in the end, the only one</i>
<i>who came to save you was Master Chai.</i>

136
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,560
<i>Marry him or not,</i>
<i>it's up to you to decide.</i>

137
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,400
It's real.

138
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,520
Yes, yes.

139
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,240
It's real. The Chai family really
came to propose marriage.

140
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,320
This must be a conspiracy.

141
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,000
The Chai family is tricking
my third sister into a life of suffering.

142
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,160
Who would use marriage as a trap?

143
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,200
Unless they have many sons,
that doesn't make sense.

144
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,720
No.

145
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,520
Kangning.

146
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,160
Don't you have anything to ask me?

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,080
Master Chai,
why have you suddenly come to propose?

148
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,240
I want to marry you.

149
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,760
I have something to ask you.

150
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,600
Why hasn't your family
responded to the proposal?

151
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,280
Are you dissatisfied with the arrangement?

152
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,600
Have you forgotten

153
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,200
how I teased, scolded, and even beat you?

154
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,560
Are you holding a grudge

155
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,000
and using the matchmaker
to humiliate my family?

156
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,040
Kangning, you hit and scolded me
because of a misunderstanding.

157
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,440
I've played tricks on you too.

158
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,600
It's only fair.

159
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,120
With your intelligence and character,
I admire you more than anything.

160
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,520
How could I possibly hold a grudge?

161
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,440
That would be so petty.

162
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,760
But Kangning,
why haven't you agreed to marry me yet?

163
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,360
They say the women of the Li family
in Luoyang are easily jealous.

164
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,680
Didn't those words come from your mouth?

165
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,240
I've long realized I was wrong.

166
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,760
If you don't believe me, bring out Fuhui.

167
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,680
I'll bow to her and apologize.
I'll make amends to you all.

168
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,600
Admitting it is good enough.

169
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,320
Just so you know, I'm even
way tougher than her.

170
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,120
If you want to marry me,
you must agree to one condition.

171
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,800
Kangning, please tell me.

172
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,160
If you marry me,
you can only have me in this lifetime.

173
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,080
No concubines, no maids, not even one.

174
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,200
My mother gave birth
to five daughters and one son,

175
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,680
showing that the women of the Li family
are strong and blessed.

176
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,240
If we reach 40 and still have no children,

177
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,680
it's because your greed has hindered you
from having descendants.

178
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,080
Then you may only adopt
from the same family line,

179
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,600
and no other thoughts are allowed.

180
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,800
If my fate is unfortunate

181
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,200
and I pass away before you,

182
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,040
you may remarry only after three years.

183
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,240
When the time comes for us,
you must share the same tomb

184
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,440
with me and remain by my side.

185
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,960
How is this just one condition?

186
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
However,

187
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,600
I agree.

188
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,640
Every word of mine is meant
to make you back out.

189
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,440
Yet you still agreed.
Did you hear me clearly?

190
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,760
You are Li Kangning.

191
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,120
Before I came to propose,
I already saw everything clearly.

192
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,880
You said a lot,
but I only have one thing to say.

193
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,640
The madam of the Chai family

194
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,240
must be intelligent, decisive,
exceptionally resilient,

195
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,280
and someone who truly moves my heart.

196
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,440
Kangning, you are the only one.

197
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,880
Kangning, apart from me, Chai An,

198
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,440
there is likely no other man in this world

199
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,320
who truly understands, appreciates, loves,

200
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,720
and respects you.

201
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,120
I hope you can think it over carefully

202
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,160
and agree to this marriage.

203
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,560
And you said it was just one thing!

204
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,680
How do you know that apart from you,

205
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,000
I can't find another soulmate?

206
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,040
Kangning.

207
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,880
When I was a child in Luoyang,
I planted a plum tree.

208
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,800
If you can help me
pick the highest branch,

209
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,840
I will marry you.

210
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,200
I won't eat.

211
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,280
An'er, what do you see
in Li Kangning of the Li family?

212
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,680
Isn't it just that she's
a bit prettier than the rest?

213
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,000
Fine.

214
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,920
You didn't like Wang Shiba,

215
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,560
so I got the sixth daughter
of the Lu family for you.

216
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,480
Her dowry is generous beyond words,

217
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,200
and her talents
and appearance are unmatched.

218
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,920
- Yes, yes!
- An'er!

219
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,360
Just meet her once.

220
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,480
Just one look. I promise you

221
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,200
she won't lose to Li Kangning.

222
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,280
If you agree, I'll eat.

223
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,520
Mother,

224
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,160
all the marriage agreements
have been done.

225
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,200
Whether you agree or not,

226
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,920
I am determined to marry Li Kangning.

227
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,320
I don't agree.
Can't you see how worried I am, son?

228
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,960
Mother,
all the small matters have been arranged.

229
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,400
I've chosen several
auspicious dates for the wedding.

230
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,440
Of course, as a son,
I would like you to decide.

231
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,760
But since you feel troubled,

232
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,200
I'll make the decision myself this time.
Set it for the second month next year.

233
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,760
If you'd agree with me,
I'd rather marry her tomorrow.

234
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,400
It would mean I could quickly
bring you a lovely daughter-in-law.

235
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,400
The Li family can't bear
to let their daughter go,

236
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,760
and want to keep her a few more days.

237
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,000
See, if anyone should be anxious
or worried, it should be me, your son.

238
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,840
Mother, don't worry.

239
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,880
Wait to enjoy the wedding tea
from your daughter-in-law.

240
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,600
An'er, are you trying
to drive your mother crazy?

241
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,440
How does it taste?

242
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,440
I specially asked the head chef
to make it for you.

243
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,560
Mother, I have an urgent matter
and need to go to Luoyang.

244
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,800
I'll be back in a few days.

245
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,040
I hope you will soon change your mind

246
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,960
and stop worrying.

247
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,640
I'd be heartbroken to see you like this.

248
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,680
Mother, I'm heading off now.
Take care of yourself.

249
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
You heard it all?

250
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,840
That's my good son!

251
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,800
When it comes to marriage, parents decide,
but he dares to act on his own.

252
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,320
He clearly doesn't care about his mother.

253
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,440
Cousin, if you ask me,
this is your fault.

254
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,480
When your husband passed away,

255
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,360
it was you who pushed An'er
to be independent in everything.

256
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,320
This entire family business

257
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,400
was placed solely on his shoulders.

258
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,120
I remember that year,
he was only 13, wasn't he?

259
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,360
At such a young age,

260
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,000
he was traveling around the world
with caravans.

261
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,800
Wolves, bandits, he's faced it all.

262
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,440
His personality
was shaped through those hardships.

263
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,200
Your son is responsible,

264
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,880
and now, you complain about it?

265
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,320
She comes from a humble family.

266
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,080
It does not match with our family.
I am already disliking this.

267
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,440
And yet she has such a mother.

268
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,920
Don't you know about her?

269
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,880
How could I not know?

270
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,000
My useless son.

271
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,160
I don't care if you laugh at me.

272
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,920
I don't know what
he did to upset his wife,

273
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,280
but he's been hiding.

274
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,280
Just this morning,

275
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,920
I pulled him out of the chicken coop.

276
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,480
My face burned with shame.

277
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,080
I only recently heard that

278
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,920
this family in Luoyang

279
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,760
is called the six fierce ladies
of the Li family.

280
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,280
They're no joke.

281
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,600
You must keep a close eye on An'er

282
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,160
to avoid any future disasters.

283
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,560
A daughter of the Li family
wanting to enter the Chai family?

284
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,760
Nothing but a pipe dream.

285
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,280
Someone, come here.

286
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,080
- Yes, Madam.
- Go invite Madam Li over.

287
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,640
- Tell her I have something to discuss.
- Yes.

288
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,520
Using cross-stitch with straight-stitch
makes the design flow better, doesn't it?

289
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,000
But this part isn't
embroidered delicately enough.

290
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,960
Straight-stitch…

291
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,080
Kangning, I'm afraid
you won't make it in time.

292
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,400
Let me embroider a shoe for you.

293
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,000
Pick a pattern you like.

294
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,280
No, I don't like osmanthus flowers.

295
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,560
Plum blossoms look much better.

296
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,720
How about this design
of a magpie on a plum branch?

297
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,840
Then, we can add gold and silver thread
with some beads. How does that sound?

298
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,600
Straight-stitch and cross-stitch…

299
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,440
How is it?

300
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,200
It's beautiful.

301
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,920
Fifteen, 20.

302
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,560
Fifteen, 20…

303
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,520
Mother!

304
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,640
Why are you here?

305
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,960
Shouldn't you be helping
your sister embroider her wedding clothes?

306
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,040
She's faster at calculating accounts
than doing needlework,

307
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,160
so I'm worried she won't finish on time.

308
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,320
Mother, I prepared the return gift
for the Chai family.

309
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,280
Were they satisfied?

310
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,120
Satisfied. Very satisfied.

311
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,840
Everything was well-prepared by you,
as always!

312
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,720
There's absolutely nothing
to be dissatisfied with.

313
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,960
Mother, did Madam Chai
make things difficult for you?

314
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,520
Well, even though the betrothal
is already settled,

315
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,320
she keeps causing trouble.

316
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,200
She even claimed the original date
set by the groom's family wasn't good.

317
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,760
She said the dowry wasn't clearly listed

318
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,280
and demanded a new auspicious date
to re-confirm the engagement.

319
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,480
In all my years, this is the first time
I've encountered someone so difficult.

320
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,320
But it's true.

321
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,280
I offended the Chai family in the past.

322
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,760
So, whatever they ask for,

323
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,800
I will do my best to fulfill.

324
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,960
As long as Kangning can marry smoothly.

325
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,280
That's the most important thing.

326
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,600
What I just said, you must not tell her.

327
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,280
Did you hear me?

328
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,640
Everything has to be placed properly.

329
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
Be careful. Take it slow.

330
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,360
Mother,
this is the returned engagement gift,

331
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,160
prepared exactly to the Chai's wishes.

332
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,360
Why has it been sent back untouched again?

333
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,920
Even the fish chopsticks
have been returned this time.

334
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,840
Did Madam Chai say anything?

335
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,360
Madam Li, you don't need to ask.
Just take a look and you'll understand.

336
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,520
Shouhua, how could you overlook this?

337
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,400
Go and prepare everything again.

338
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,400
Yes.

339
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,640
That's why arranging
a marriage is so difficult.

340
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,160
From the draft invitation
to the formal engagement,

341
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,880
every detail must be handled with care.

342
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,720
The living fish died halfway.

343
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,320
How unlucky is that?

344
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,360
Don't you agree?

345
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,920
Yes,
it's my fault for not thinking it through.

346
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,720
This time, I'll inspect everything
before sending it to the Chai family.

347
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,960
Our lady also
shared a little tip for your reference.

348
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,440
Replace the live fish with goldfish

349
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,320
and the fish chopsticks
with silver chopsticks.

350
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,200
It will look elegant

351
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,400
and ensure no delays.

352
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,280
So the match for both families
won't be ruined.

353
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,720
What do you think?

354
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,240
Madam Chai's suggestion
is absolutely right.

355
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,080
We'll follow everything
exactly as suggested.

356
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,320
No wonder my mistress says

357
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,200
you're the most reasonable woman
in this world.

358
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,960
As long as it's explained clearly,

359
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,640
she'll never act like those families
without a sense of propriety.

360
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,720
Some families don't
consider the difference in status,

361
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,400
whether they can match or not.

362
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,440
They always try to climb higher,
yet during marriage discussions,

363
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,560
they end up causing so many jokes.

364
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,520
You're different!

365
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,160
Whatever is asked of you,
you agree wholeheartedly.

366
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,720
You would never nitpick or make a fuss.

367
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,840
You short-lived soul.

368
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,360
If only you hadn't left us so early,

369
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,440
abandoning us halfway through life.

370
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,480
Why must I endure such treatment today?

371
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,080
I'll hit you,
so you can't rest easy day after day.

372
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,160
I'll curse you, so you can't
sleep soundly night after night.

373
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,120
I don't truly mean to hit you,

374
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,480
but Kangning…

375
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,680
She's such a considerate child.

376
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,800
Back then, when your family

377
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,320
pressured us to give up
our house and land,

378
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,040
she was so young.

379
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,640
Even so, she dared to take up a knife
to protect her mother.

380
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,800
Daughters in other families
were raised carefully,

381
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,320
but ours?

382
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,760
Every day was filled with fear,

383
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,880
hardship, and suffering.

384
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,520
It's all your fault.

385
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,160
If you have any spirit left

386
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,000
in the heavens,

387
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,040
can you protect Kangning?

388
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,880
Can you make sure
her marriage goes smoothly?

389
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,000
Can you ensure

390
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,600
there are no more obstacles?

391
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,480
Can you truly bless her?

392
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,200
You…

393
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,360
Can you

394
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,880
make her marriage smooth
and free from further trouble?

395
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,480
I am all alone now.

396
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,960
It's really

397
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,200
so hard to be a single mother.

398
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,440
Please ensure her marriage is smooth.

399
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,720
No more twists and turns.

400
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,560
Please.

401
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,240
Madam Chai, dear in-law,

402
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,360
everything was done
according to your instructions.

403
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,560
If there's still anything unsatisfactory,
just tell me, and I'll change it.

404
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,560
This time, nothing is wrong
with the preparations.

405
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,040
But the person is not right.

406
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,120
The person?
What's wrong with the person?

407
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,480
What person?

408
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,360
Madam Chai, dear in-law,

409
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,480
I know
there were some past grievances

410
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,720
between our families.

411
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,400
But it's all my fault.

412
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,120
I was blind and unreasonable.

413
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,800
I offended kindhearted people

414
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,000
and was lucky you that tolerated me.

415
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,920
Today, I'm here to sincerely apologize.

416
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,320
I hope you'll consider
the marriage between our families.

417
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,360
Drink this reconciliation wine

418
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,320
and let's wipe away

419
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,160
all the unpleasantness of the past.

420
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,320
Let's happily complete
the wedding arrangements.

421
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,320
Shall we?

422
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,200
You're overthinking.

423
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,920
I'm not so petty and unwilling
to see the bigger picture.

424
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,560
- It's just that…
- Just what?

425
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,960
Madam, we're all family here.

426
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,880
As your daughter-in-law,
I'll speak out of turn.

427
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,960
It seems Aunt has concerns

428
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,840
but doesn't want to state them outright.

429
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,920
Since our families are about to be joined,

430
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,680
if there's truly a difficulty,
it's best to speak openly.

431
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,760
You're just a child.

432
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,760
What do you understand about
the ways of the world?

433
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,720
Your aunt doesn't speak up

434
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,360
because she has a soft heart.

435
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,680
She's afraid that saying it will
cause suffering for someone else.

436
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,480
Since you're pressing for an answer, fine,

437
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,080
I'll be the villain today

438
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,640
and speak on her behalf.

439
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,400
The gifts from the Li family are fine,

440
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,200
but the person who prepared them
is absolutely not suitable.

441
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,800
For wedding preparations,

442
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,200
it's customary to choose a woman
whose parents are both alive,

443
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,480
and enjoy a harmonious marriage,

444
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,640
and have many sons and daughters.

445
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,080
Those who lost their father young,

446
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,280
became widows early, or have no son

447
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,080
are considered unlucky

448
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,480
and should be avoided.

449
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,960
Madam, how could you say such a thing?

450
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,320
- My eldest sister, she--
- Fuhui,

451
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,160
don't interrupt the elders.

452
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,520
Fine.

453
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,280
We'll find a perfect woman.

454
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,400
We'll redo… everything.

455
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,520
There's no need for that.

456
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,600
Mother, sister.

457
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,360
The adults are discussing the marriage.

458
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,760
How improper. Go back at once.

459
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,960
My eldest sister
could compose poetry at three

460
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,520
and write essays at seven.

461
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,160
She is the only one who read every book

462
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,520
in our late father's study.

463
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,280
My skills in tea brewing,
flower arranging,

464
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,400
embroidery, and sewing
were all taught by her.

465
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,520
To protect her widowed mother and sisters,
and to keep the family's land and estate,

466
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,240
she married into
the Wu family of Luoyang at just 15,

467
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,120
to a man stricken with tuberculosis.

468
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,960
She is not some woman who
brings misfortune to her family.

469
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,080
She is the pride of our Li family.

470
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,640
I kindly ask the two ladies
not to speak such hurtful words.

471
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,880
Otherwise, the ones disgraced
will be your own family.

472
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,640
You!

473
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,960
How dare you be so rude?

474
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,760
Do you still wish
to marry into the Chai family?

475
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,560
Kangning, hold your tongue.

476
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,040
Our family statuses are unmatched.
The marriage is disharmony.

477
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,400
Why force it then?
It would only lead to mutual resentment.

478
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
This marriage ends here.

479
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,520
Mother, let's go.

480
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,520
Sister.

481
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,800
Arrogance!

482
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,400
Truly, like mother, like daughter.

483
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,120
This is the legacy of their upbringing.

484
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,440
Kangning!

485
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,120
Madam Li.

486
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,240
Look, I brought back
the plum blossom you wanted.

487
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,720
Madam.

488
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,200
Aunt.

489
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,920
I must return to check
on my mother and sisters.

490
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,360
I'll take my leave.

491
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,000
The old plum tree in your courtyard
is 30 feet tall. Climbing it wasn't easy.

492
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,080
But nothing is too difficult for me
if makes you happy.

493
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,720
Kangning, let's go.

494
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,760
Kangning!

495
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,120
An'er.

496
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,040
This time,
it's not that I don't want to help you.

497
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,960
Just as the betrothal gift
was about to be sent,

498
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,680
the Li family
suddenly changed their minds.

499
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,400
It seems this marriage
truly isn't meant to be.

500
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,800
Cousin Chai, matters of marriage
are determined by fate.

501
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,680
Knowing it's destined to fail,
it's better for both sides to retreat.

502
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,440
To avoid becoming a couple
who hate each other and hold grudges.

503
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,880
Following my mother's wishes,

504
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,000
although the marriage didn't succeed,
the familial ties remain.

505
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,480
We'll still have to interact.

506
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,400
From now on, you and my third sister
should regard each other as siblings.

507
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,000
Let's not discuss marriage again.

508
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,680
Please look for another match
and find a suitable partner.

509
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,440
I don't believe
all these excuses about mismatched status

510
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,880
or disharmonious marriage.

511
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,480
Before I left, the families
exchanged betrothal notes,

512
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,800
the bride price was given,

513
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,840
and the marriage was agreed upon.

514
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,160
There were no changes.

515
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,280
There must be a reason

516
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,600
for the sudden cancellation.

517
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,400
Was it something my mother said?

518
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,120
Whatever the difficulty,
Kangning should disregard it entirely.

519
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,920
She should trust only me!

520
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,880
Even if this marriage is to be annulled,

521
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,480
bring her out

522
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,160
to tell me directly.

523
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,840
Speak up!

524
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,280
It's your fault to begin with.

525
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,280
Arguments during

526
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,880
marriage arrangements are common.

527
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,000
My aunt only asked you
to find someone perfect.

528
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,800
It was out of a desire
for a smooth marriage,

529
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,040
which is entirely reasonable.

530
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,440
And yet you guys instigated her
to cancel the marriage.

531
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,000
If you want to annul it,
you should never have let him

532
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,760
travel that far
to pick those plum blossoms.

533
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,040
Isn't this just fooling him?

534
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,400
I asked you to mediate.

535
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,320
Whose side are you on?

536
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,000
Whoever has reason,
that's the side I'll take.

537
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,080
Cousin Chai's affection
is sincere enough to move even a stone,

538
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,880
let alone your third sister.

539
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,840
Your family annulled the engagement
for no reason, and refuses to show face.

540
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,240
How could the Li family
display such heartless behavior?

541
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,360
Say that again!

542
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,800
I just did.

543
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,040
Instead of considering my cousin,

544
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,440
they cater to his mother.

545
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,840
Is she marrying my cousin
or trying to become my uncle?

546
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,280
- You--
- Enough!

547
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,480
Does Kangning truly refuse to see me,

548
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,760
not even willing to offer an explanation?

549
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,120
Cousin, it's over.

550
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,400
Let it go.

551
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,920
There are countless great women
in Bianjing.

552
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Why worry?

553
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,040
Kangning.

554
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,680
In the end, you don't trust me.

555
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,400
Cousin!

556
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,960
Why are you so heartless,
unwilling to speak the truth?

557
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,920
If I tell the truth,

558
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,960
it will create conflict
between his mother and him.

559
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,080
Marriage is meant to unite two families.

560
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,040
When they repeatedly insult my family,

561
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,720
how can I bear it?

562
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,920
Yet his mother raised him with great care.

563
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,400
If I speak out too much,

564
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,360
how can he not resent me?

565
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,280
Over time, even the most loving couple

566
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,520
will turn against each other.

567
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,320
Why suffer through that?

568
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,000
This plum branch
was originally from the Li family.

569
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,840
I'll keep it.

570
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:31,160
But please return these jewels to him.

571
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,320
He won't accept them.

572
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,240
What a shame!

573
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,000
Such a perfect match!

574
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,440
Sister Qiongnu!

575
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,280
- Sister Qiongnu.
- What…

576
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,960
What are you doing?

577
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,160
Sister Qiongnu, why aren't you speaking?

578
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,280
Third sister, look.

579
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,680
She's undoing your wedding dress.

580
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,280
Qiongnu!

581
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,600
Every stitch and thread here
was embroidered by me for you.

582
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,280
I think it's unlucky and inauspicious,

583
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,280
so I'm undoing it for you.

584
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,360
What's so unlucky about it?

585
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,600
I thought it looked fine.

586
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,480
Kangning, I have no parents.
I've been cursed with misfortune.

587
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,040
I'm afraid I've tainted your wedding dress
and ruined your marriage.

588
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,560
Blame me.

589
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,880
Blame me for it.

590
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,880
Tear it apart if you want.
It's not needed anymore anyway.

591
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,000
There are plenty of good men in the world.

592
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,680
If this one doesn't work out,
we'll find another.

593
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,480
That's easy for you to say.

594
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,280
Where are we going to find
a match better than the Chai family?

595
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,960
Have you noticed lately

596
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,400
how many scholars
have come to the capital?

597
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,440
Our tea house is packed with
people discussing poetry and philosophy.

598
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,280
All they ever talk about is knowledge.

599
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,920
It's making my head spin.

600
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,120
Even Mother is finding it hard to keep up.

601
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,280
The Spring Examination is approaching.

602
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,040
The scholars from all over our country
are flocking to Bianjing

603
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,960
to prepare for next spring's provincial
exams hosted by the Ministry of Rites.

604
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,480
This is truly a gathering

605
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,880
of brilliant minds and talents.

606
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,960
Aren't you worried about
finding a husband?

607
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,120
Here they are, delivered to your doorstep.

608
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,840
Are you thinking of catching someone
straight off the ranking board?

609
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,600
They say, a farmer by day,
a court official by night.

610
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,800
Everyone says the top scholar is the best.

611
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,000
Did you know a top scholar is fit
only for a prime minister's daughter?

612
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,200
Once they make the list,

613
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,880
all the prominent officials
will be vying for them.

614
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,040
How will you get a chance?

615
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,760
So, are you suggesting that…

616
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,280
Most of the brightest scholars
come from humble origins.

617
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,480
Not only must you know
how to identify talent,

618
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,560
but you must also act
before the rankings are announced.

619
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,520
<i>Kangning, apart from me, Chai An,</i>

620
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,200
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>there is another man in this world</i>

621
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,320
<i>who truly understands,</i>
<i>cherishes, and respects you.</i>

622
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,560
<i>I hope you'll think it over carefully</i>
<i>and agree to this marriage.</i>

623
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,200
Let Daddy pick
some red plum blossoms for you.

624
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,320
Alright.

625
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,280
Kangning.

626
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,160
Dad, the plum blossoms are so beautiful.

627
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,160
LI CHANGAN, LI'S FATHER

628
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,640
When you come of age,

629
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,840
this plum tree I planted
would have grown tall.

630
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,960
By then, I'll pick the highest branch
of red plum blossoms for you.

631
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,440
And I'll watch as your brother
carries you on his back to your wedding.

632
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,200
Dad, what's wrong?

633
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,920
My Kangning
is the most resilient in our family.

634
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,960
In the future, you must help your brother

635
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,800
look after your mother and sisters.

636
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,640
Master Chai, my master is entertaining
guests in the hall.

637
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,320
He specifically instructed us
to bring you in as soon as you arrive.

638
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,360
Thank you.

639
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,440
What an ungrateful boy!

640
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,720
No matter how much I reasoned,

641
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,280
he wouldn't agree.

642
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,360
He's just a poor scholar
heading to the exams.

643
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,200
Whether he can succeed is still uncertain.

644
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,040
Yet, he dares

645
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,560
to look down on my daughter.

646
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,440
Who would be so bold

647
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,160
as to anger you, my uncle?

648
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,720
Nephew, you're here.

649
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,720
Uncle, with the winter solstice coming
and the weather turning colder,

650
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,040
my mother asked me to bring you
some winter greens from our estate.

651
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,560
She said that the pears and clams
Aunt sent last time have been received.

652
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,920
She is very thankful for those.

653
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,920
This time, we've brought
ten melons from Jiyang.

654
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Though out of season,

655
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,280
they are as large as jars,
sweet, and crisp.

656
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,000
My aunt, who complains of a bitter taste

657
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,360
during winter, will be delighted.

658
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,320
Such small matters.

659
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,120
No need for you
to come personally next time.

660
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,800
You can just send someone.

661
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,840
But I also wanted to pay
my respects to you, Uncle.

662
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,360
Well…

663
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,560
I happened to see him
near Xingguo Temple selling calligraphy.

664
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:06,600
He writes beautifully,
and I couldn't help but admire his talent.

665
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,520
I had the thought
of marrying my daughter to him.

666
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,520
I hinted at it subtly,

667
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,600
hoping he would appreciate the gesture.

668
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,480
But who would have thought
he would outright reject me?

669
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,360
Such disrespect!

670
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,920
Old Master, you said you invited me here

671
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,520
to paint a mural.
Which is why I agreed to come here.

672
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,480
But once I'm here,

673
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,480
you're offering a dowry
and suddenly proposing a match.

674
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,520
I politely declined yet you persisted
and pressured me.

675
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,480
Do you not realize that forcing someone
into marriage is unreasonable?

676
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,080
Du Yangxi,
you haven't even taken the exams yet

677
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,560
and you already think you'll pass?

678
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:49,240
Even if you pass and work in government,
there will be so much suffering.

679
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,520
Do you know what it takes
to survive in the capital?

680
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,280
Could your yearly salary
even afford a house

681
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,400
or get a wife?

682
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,480
I came here to paint, not to marry.

683
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,120
If I'm not painting,

684
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,720
I'll take my leave.

685
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,680
Let's see if you can walk out of here.

686
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,280
Guards!

687
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,760
Uncle, calm down.

688
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,080
If he's here to paint, then let him paint.

689
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,680
Within one hour,
if the painting turns out well,

690
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,080
will you let him go for my sake?

691
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,000
If it's not satisfactory
and ruins the wall,

692
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,400
you can punish him
by making him repaint it as a laborer.

693
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,520
How about that?

694
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,440
Fine, let him paint.

695
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,480
I won't need two hours.
The burning time of an incense is enough.

696
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,000
Bring it in.

697
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,960
It's too small.

698
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,440
Uncle, who is this?

699
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,280
Just a servant.

700
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,360
Mr. Du,

701
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,400
no matter how well or poorly you paint,
the outcome won't matter.

702
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,520
If my uncle wants someone to stay,
they won't escape.

703
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,960
Master Chai, we're old acquaintances.
Won't you lend me a hand?

704
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,640
When have we met before?

705
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,160
Two years ago, during the floods in Ezhou,

706
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,920
while traveling for business,

707
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,760
you saw desperate refugees
pleading for help.

708
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,040
You ordered all the silk on your boat
to be thrown into the river

709
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,280
so the refugees could board.

710
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,400
You saved the lives
of three full boats of people.

711
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,280
How do you know about this?

712
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,600
My mother was old and blind.

713
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,480
I carried her all the way, fleeing.

714
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,840
Without your help,

715
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,760
we would have drowned in the river.

716
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,480
The memory of that moment is still vivid.

717
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,640
I thought you were still
the righteous merchant I remembered.

718
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,680
Who would have thought

719
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,920
you'd now aid in such oppressive acts?

720
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,440
The painting is done, right?
Let me see it.

721
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,120
This… This painting isn't that remarkable.

722
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,840
Uncle.

723
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,680
Uncle, the scholar taking the capital
exams has submitted his application

724
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,120
and family guarantees
to the Ministry of Rites.

725
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,840
He's registered, so you cannot detain him.
Detaining him would cause trouble.

726
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,400
Besides, the capital
is full of talented scholars.

727
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,240
Why worry about
not finding a good son-in-law?

728
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,800
If you forcibly detain him here,

729
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,000
rumors of this marriage refusal
will spread.

730
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,040
It'll make your daughter's
marriage prospects worse.

731
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,080
Fine. You're lucky this time.

732
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,880
Escort him out.

733
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,200
Why is there such a crowd?

734
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,120
What's going on?

735
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,520
You asked someone to write these.

736
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,200
"Doing good deeds brings blessings.

737
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,520
Forcing someone into marriage
cannot lead to lasting happiness."

738
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,720
This…

739
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,480
"Every small kindness has its rewards,

740
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,120
and withholding goodness
cannot be hidden from God's eyes."

741
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:26,560
This…

742
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,040
Who wrote this?
Why didn't anyone stop them?

743
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,000
We can't read,
and the guest said you wanted it written.

744
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,720
You fool!

745
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,680
Hurry up and erase it.

746
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,520
Erase it now! Quickly!

747
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,760
What are you standing around for?
Nothing to see!

748
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,520
Such audacity, Du Yangxi.

749
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,680
What's there to see?
Move along. Nothing to see here!

750
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,880
Move along, quickly!

751
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,720
Something's wrong.

752
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,000
Head to Xingguo Temple. Now!

753
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,880
- Why are we going?
- To save someone!

754
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,600
What's going on here? Stop it!

755
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,880
Let's go! Let's go!

756
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,800
Mr. Du.

757
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,360
Are you alright?

758
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,600
Sir, his injury is even worse!

759
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,760
