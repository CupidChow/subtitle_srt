00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,480
EPISODE 4

2
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,680
Once the betrothal is settled,

3
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,600
we'll all be family.

4
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,640
Kangning, hurry up and greet him properly.

5
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,160
Sir, I pay my respects.

6
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,400
Earlier, I was reckless
and ignorant and offended you.

7
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,320
I hope you'll be gracious enough

8
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,920
to forgive me.

9
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,960
It's nothing. Please, rise, my lady.

10
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,880
Sir,

11
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,280
you must understand,
we're just a humble family.

12
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,000
We're not well-versed in proper etiquette,

13
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,200
and it must've amused you.

14
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,680
So, my lady, have you
changed your mind now?

15
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,080
This is mostly my fault.

16
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,440
I didn't realize
you are someone so distinguished.

17
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,000
Sir, I had no idea that you come

18
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,160
from a noble family in Bianjing.

19
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,800
Your family even produced a consort!

20
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,480
For someone like you to lower yourself

21
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,280
to our humble home,

22
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,800
it's truly our blessing.

23
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,240
If we are still rejected,
that'd just be ungrateful.

24
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,120
Kangning, quickly, pour the wine for him!

25
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Yes.

26
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,800
Sir, it's true,

27
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,920
we're not incredibly wealthy,

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,840
but we live comfortably and have
no worries about food or clothing.

29
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,120
It wasn't easy
to raise such a delicate daughter.

30
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,800
We'd hoped she'd find

31
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,400
a good place to enjoy a life of comfort.

32
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,520
So, our entire family can…

33
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,920
Don't worry.
I'll make sure someone looks after

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,240
the business of the Sifu House.

35
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,640
We might not be as wealthy as the royalty,
but as long as I'm around,

36
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,760
your family will never
lack food or clothing.

37
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,200
Kangning, did you hear that?

38
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,560
Oh.

39
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,720
Sir, we're just a family
of unfortunate souls,

40
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,280
but it seems we've finally

41
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,920
found a big tree to shelter under.

42
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,840
Sir, this way, please.

43
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,000
Come, come. Be careful.

44
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,080
Sir, please.

45
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,000
Sir, you hold your drink well!

46
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,200
Kangning, quickly, refill his cup.

47
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,680
Brother,

48
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,480
Mother-in-law
has found an excuse to make amends.

49
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,000
She's hosting a feast for that Yang guy,

50
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,960
but he's very cautious and refuses
to go to the Sifu House.

51
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,800
So, they've chosen
the Pan Restaurant instead.

52
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,480
Come here.

53
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,520
Is Li Kangning really going to marry
into the Yang family as a concubine?

54
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,560
The Yang family's status
isn't exactly a disgrace,

55
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,440
but Yang Xian is reckless,
arrogant, and utterly lawless.

56
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,040
He's certainly no good match.
How could she be so foolish

57
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,400
as to promise Kangning to him?

58
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,880
Go on. Keep listening. Hurry, go listen!

59
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,040
- Quick!
- Wait. Wait a moment!

60
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,320
No, no, no.

61
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,440
I've had too much after just a few drinks.

62
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,680
I need some fresh air. Ms. Liu.

63
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,160
Help me to the corridor for some air.

64
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,440
Sir, make yourself comfortable.
I'll excuse myself for a bit.

65
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
Please.

66
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,360
Kangning, sit down, sit down!

67
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,440
It's not right to let
an honored guest sit alone.

68
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,200
Keep him company and have another drink.

69
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,680
- I'll just be a moment.
- Yes.

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,160
Really,

71
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,560
- can't even pick up a single shrimp?
- Here, sir!

72
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,400
Shameless scoundrel!

73
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,800
Don't rush, don't rush.

74
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,960
Rush! How could he not rush?

75
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,520
This despicable fool was hoping
for Mother-in-law to leave.

76
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,280
Brother, what were you saying earlier?

77
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,880
So, you're truly sincere.

78
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Why must you insist on taking me in?

79
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,520
The old man keeps pressuring me to marry.

80
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,440
Taking in a concubine
before the bride arrives

81
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,160
will truly infuriate him to death.

82
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,160
Sir, you really are quite amusing.

83
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,280
I've heard His Majesty plans to appoint
you as Assistant Commander of the Guards.

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,840
When I heard, I was overjoyed.

85
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,720
I present you this flower
as a token of my feelings.

86
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,080
What gift might you bestow upon me?

87
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,440
No rush. I'll send someone
to prepare something when I return.

88
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,240
That's more like it.

89
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,120
What about the skirt I gave you earlier?

90
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,280
Worried you wouldn't admit it,
I even brought it along with me.

91
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,040
Turns out I was overthinking.

92
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,880
My lady, take a look. It's right here.

93
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,920
This is embarrassing.

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,200
I'd better take it back.

95
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,440
Oh no, this won't do. This is evidence.

96
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,760
That floral veil from the other day,
was it really yours, my lady?

97
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,720
If you were setting me up,

98
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,320
I wouldn't let the Li family off lightly!

99
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,520
Sir, you're overthinking it.
If that's not mine,

100
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,480
whose could it be?

101
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Still, I've always admired

102
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,400
scholars and men of talent.

103
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,120
I've vowed to marry
a well-educated gentleman.

104
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,560
Only then would I be truly satisfied.

105
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,040
I wonder how skilled you are at poetry.

106
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,960
You are underestimating me!

107
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,200
Writing a couple of verses
is no challenge at all.

108
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,280
Brother, what's going on?

109
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,440
- Deqing.
- At your service.

110
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,040
- Follow Li Kangning.
- Yes.

111
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,440
Brother,

112
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,080
are you suspecting
that Kangning has other plans?

113
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,160
Someone as proud as she is,

114
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
I don't believe she'd willingly
become a concubine.

115
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,320
I need to see for myself

116
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,520
what scheme she's plotting in secret.

117
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,680
Sir, look.

118
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
There they are.

119
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,000
Fan Lianghan,

120
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,160
take a good look!
That woman is from the Li family?

121
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,400
We're not selling!

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,640
That's right. My wife mentioned Qiongnu
was stranded in Luoyang at the age of six.

123
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,080
She was taken in by my mother-in-law,
who intended to marry her to my uncle.

124
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,680
Who would've thought
she'd lose him before they could wed?

125
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,680
She's left as a pitiful widow.
How did she end up here?

126
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,640
- I'll go and see.
- Stay put.

127
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,320
Look at those two.

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,800
They're neither loudly hawking their wares

129
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,640
nor bargaining over prices.

130
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,000
Instead, they're glancing around

131
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,760
as if waiting for someone. Let's wait.

132
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,040
Here they come.

133
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,680
- Chamberlain Wang, Chamberlain Wang.
- I knew a court official would come.

134
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,080
I've spent a year crafting this piece,

135
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,080
including patterns
of items for all seasons,

136
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,080
adorned with rubies and sapphires.
Buy one, please!

137
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,200
Look at mine!

138
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,400
A butterfly landing on flowers,
like a real thing. A masterpiece!

139
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,600
It's much better than his.

140
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,600
Alright, alright, one at a time.

141
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,240
- My wife?
- Keep quiet!

142
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,080
Those are fine jewelries.

143
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,000
Let's have a look.

144
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,400
Such exquisite embroidery!

145
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,960
And the gems are dazzling.
What's the price?

146
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,160
Fifty strings of coins.

147
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,520
Too expensive!

148
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,720
The silk I bought yesterday
was only four strings a bolt.

149
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,360
Whose skirt costs 50 strings of coins?

150
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,280
Are you out of your mind with poverty?

151
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,760
What a beautiful pearl skirt!

152
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,120
The imperial-grade floral brocade
is only ten strings of coins.

153
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,400
This doesn't even have gold inlays!

154
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,200
The embroidery and fabric are top-notch,

155
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,560
but the pearls are just fragments.

156
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,000
This is way too expensive.

157
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,320
I think I know
who they're waiting for now.

158
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,760
What's wrong with 50 strings of coins?

159
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,520
This is an heirloom pearl canopy
from my lady master.

160
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,720
It's part of her dowry.

161
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
If the canopy were still intact,

162
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,600
I'd charge you 100,000 strings!

163
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,440
Take a good look.

164
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,680
Even though these are broken pearls,

165
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,040
they're all top-quality northern pearls.

166
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,640
You can scour this whole street

167
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,120
and you won't find anything like it.

168
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,800
You just don't know fine goods.

169
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,720
Let me take a look.

170
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,720
Sure, have a look.

171
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,040
The embroidery is truly exquisite,

172
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,840
and the craftsmanship is remarkable.

173
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,080
But unfortunately, these pearls

174
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,680
are a bit too ordinary.

175
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,640
In the palace, they're common.

176
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,640
They aren't worth much.

177
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,440
- Fine pearls, Chamberlain Wang.
- Top-quality northern pearls.

178
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,040
Since such fine goods
are beyond their reach, I'll take them.

179
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,720
My sister-in-law looks best
in pearl adornments,

180
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,080
and this pearl skirt will suit her well.

181
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,320
It's you!

182
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,160
You mentioned 50 strings of coins earlier?

183
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,560
Yes.

184
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,360
It just so happens I've exchanged
some silver. Keep the change.

185
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,520
This…

186
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,360
I'm buying it.

187
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,840
What's your problem?

188
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,640
There's a principle
of first come, first served--

189
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh, Chamberlain Wang, forgive my rudeness!

190
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,040
I ordered some wine in the Pan Restaurant
and was about to invite you to a feast.

191
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,800
How fortunate to meet you here by chance!

192
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,200
Are you treasure-hunting
for Consort Shang again?

193
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,400
On the first and 15th of every month,

194
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,880
I come here to browse the market

195
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,800
for some new and unique stuff.

196
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,680
It's just a petty way

197
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,240
to amuse the nobles.

198
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,720
Consort Shang has a particular love
for pearl adornments,

199
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,360
and this pearl skirt

200
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,240
will suit her perfectly.

201
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,400
I wonder if you could part with it?

202
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,720
Chamberlain Wang.

203
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,360
- I won't take what Consort Shang desires.
- Thank you.

204
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,920
Please.

205
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,840
Master Chai, you have opened a new shop.

206
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,800
Some other day,

207
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,920
I will personally visit
to congratulate you.

208
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,400
I must take my leave now.

209
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,960
This is just a small token of respect.

210
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,200
Tonight, I will prepare a modest banquet

211
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,400
to welcome you.

212
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,480
Chamberlain Wang, take care.

213
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,200
Please.

214
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,960
Sister-in-law,
what's so unusual about this skirt?

215
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,880
You refuse to sell it
to this buyer or that,

216
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,320
but you sell it specifically
to those who serve Consort Shang?

217
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,880
It's a misunderstanding.

218
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,520
My younger sister is getting married,
so we rushed to make a few new outfits.

219
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,760
But she insisted that pearl-studded
and jade-adorned designs are common,

220
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,440
but something this luxurious is rare.

221
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,120
It's not suitable
for ordinary families, so I…

222
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,720
I came out to create some buzz
and raised the price, of course!

223
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,440
It just happened that someone
from the palace bought it.

224
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,760
Well, how was I supposed to know
he was from the palace?

225
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,200
I didn't recognize him at all.

226
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,080
He probably hasn't gone far yet.

227
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,200
- Husband!
- Brother!

228
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,720
You know they're in trouble.
Why not show some mercy?

229
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,640
Fine, sister-in-law.

230
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,600
If you tell me the whole truth today,

231
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,360
I'll pretend I didn't see anything.

232
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,600
But if you tell even one word of lie,

233
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,680
I'll bring him back

234
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,080
and confront you on the spot!

235
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,040
<i>Kangning,</i>

236
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,200
<i>what if this plan doesn't work?</i>

237
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,080
<i>If fate isn't on my side,</i>

238
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,920
<i>then let me marry today</i>
<i>and become a widow tomorrow.</i>

239
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,040
SONG RENZONG, THE EMPEROR

240
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,520
Your Majesty, please have some tea.

241
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,880
Again, something procured
from outside the palace?

242
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,160
This doesn't comply with palace protocols.

243
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,000
Your Majesty, just tell me.

244
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,600
Do I look good

245
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,920
in this pearl dress?

246
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,520
The floral and bird patterns are lifelike,
and the design is exquisite.

247
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,200
Truly extraordinary.

248
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,600
Compared to paintings,

249
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,520
it's even more stunning.

250
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,080
Come closer.

251
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,480
BY YANG XIAN

252
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,000
- How dare you!
- Calm down, Your Majesty.

253
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,160
- Quick, summon Consort Yang!
- Yes.

254
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,880
Please, my lady,
step into the sedan chair.

255
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,360
Good son-in-law,

256
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,640
allow me to change into proper attire,

257
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,880
so I can personally escort
my daughter to your residence.

258
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,120
It's my duty

259
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,080
as a mother.

260
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,040
It's not like you won't see her again.

261
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,240
Stop being so sentimental.

262
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,240
Look, it's getting late.

263
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Time to get going.

264
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,240
If they dare
force her into the sedan chair,

265
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,040
we'll have no choice but to confront them.

266
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,200
- Hold on!
- For what?

267
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,080
If we wait any longer,
she'll be in the sedan chair.

268
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,040
Once she's at the Yang residence,
even if we have some superpower,

269
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,160
we can't get her back.

270
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,080
I said wait.

271
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,200
How am I supposed to explain this
to my wife?

272
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,920
It's getting late. Stop stalling!

273
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,040
Are you having second thoughts?

274
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,920
Get in the sedan chair now.

275
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,880
Sisters are about to be separated.

276
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,920
Must you rush so much?

277
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,200
Can't you let us say goodbye properly?

278
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,720
I said get in the sedan chair!
Didn't you hear me?

279
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,560
- Get in!
- Now, get in! Get in!

280
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,120
- Get in! Get in now! Get in!
- Get in!

281
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,760
They're stealing her away!

282
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,000
Do something! Cousin, act now!

283
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,560
Kangning!

284
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,360
Here they come.

285
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,560
Sir, don't!

286
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,680
Absolutely not! Absolutely not!

287
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,400
Palace envoys have reached our place.
They want to hold you accountable.

288
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,600
It seems to be about that pearl skirt.

289
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,000
Li Kangning,
what have you done to the skirt?

290
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,560
Sir, could it be that lewd poem

291
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,920
you personally wrote?

292
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,520
"A touch of red upon her lips,
like blossoms in full bloom.

293
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,440
Her lingering blush and loose-tied hair,
a beauty fills the room.

294
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,920
She seems no less than nymphs divine,
who grace the mountain's crest.

295
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Let not her leave for distant lands."

296
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,520
Or perhaps it's the complaint
I hid in the waistband,

297
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,400
accusing Yang Xian,
Assistant Commander of the Guards,

298
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,000
of harassing a common woman,

299
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,160
using threats and coercion
to force her into being a concubine?

300
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,400
- You're seeking death!
- You…

301
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,160
Sir!

302
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,680
Chai An, you dare stand in my way too?

303
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,440
- Guards, seize them!
- Go!

304
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,720
Who dares?

305
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,920
You've just received your appointment
through imperial favor.

306
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,360
You haven't even enjoyed
two peaceful days.

307
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,480
Yet His Majesty despises nothing more

308
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,520
than arrogant bullies

309
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,720
who exploit others.

310
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,640
I suggest you go to the palace gates now,
humbly admit your fault,

311
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,880
so not to bring Consort Yang
and the entire Yang family down with you.

312
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,120
If you continue causing trouble here

313
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,840
and the matter escalates,

314
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,040
even if His Majesty is lenient,

315
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,080
the pens of the officials

316
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,680
won't let you off.

317
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,720
I'll remember this humiliation today.

318
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,840
One day, I'll make you repay
a hundred-fold!

319
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,120
Master Yang, instead
of wasting time here making threats,

320
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,680
you'd be better off thinking about

321
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,640
the punishment
awaiting you from the palace.

322
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,120
Will it be mere dismissal

323
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,000
or demotion and exile?

324
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,640
Sir, sir!

325
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
His Majesty's command cannot be delayed!

326
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,400
Get out!

327
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,280
Go, go, go!

328
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,800
That young man is quite handsome,

329
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,400
but his temper is so foul
that it's truly frightening.

330
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,440
Kangning is too timid.

331
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,320
If it were me, I'd get in the sedan chair
and marry into his family.

332
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,000
Just watch how I'd handle him,
make him utterly obedient!

333
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,880
If he dares defy me even once,
I'd make sure he can't live

334
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,000
nor die in peace.

335
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,240
Whoever marries you might as well
have married a monster.

336
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,480
Big talk.

337
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,920
If he did marry me,

338
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,240
he couldn't serve me properly,
even if he kowtowed day and night.

339
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,640
Good son-in-law,

340
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,640
we're truly indebted to you today.

341
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,960
If not for you, Kangning
would have suffered greatly.

342
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,880
Don't mention it.

343
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,960
It's all because of Cousin's help.
Yang Xian wouldn't have dared act out.

344
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,840
Thank you, sir, for your help!

345
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,320
It was the right thing to do.

346
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,320
I have matters at home.
I'll express my gratitude another day.

347
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,000
Take care. I won't see you out.

348
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,440
Quick, go! Hurry, hurry!

349
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,040
- Mother-in-law!
- Close the door. Close it quickly!

350
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,800
Don't look, don't look. Quickly!

351
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,760
Cousin, on behalf of my mother-in-law
and Kangning, thank you again.

352
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,320
If it weren't for you,
things would have turned out much worse.

353
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,120
I don't think anyone here
truly intends to thank me.

354
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,560
Cousin!

355
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,640
Cousin!

356
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,720
My mother-in-law!

357
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,200
What am I supposed to do now?
This is hard!

358
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,640
SIFU HOUSE

359
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,440
Mom creates troubles,
but can't you act with some sense?

360
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,520
Everything I said

361
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,080
was for your sake!

362
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,520
I thought he was
a cold-hearted, distant man,

363
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,840
the hardest kind to deal with,

364
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,840
but when you were in trouble,

365
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,760
we needed the perfect timing

366
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,320
and opportunity to bring
our complaint to His Majesty.

367
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,760
Our petition made it directly
to His Majesty.

368
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,600
This must be because

369
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,320
of his hidden help with Consort Shang.

370
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,680
Also,

371
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,560
if he hadn't lent a hand yesterday,

372
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,080
your delicate face

373
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,080
- wouldn't have survived that slap.
- Alright, alright!

374
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,640
Stop it. I'll do whatever you say.

375
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,760
I'll go in later and thank him properly.
Is that enough?

376
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,160
That's what I wanted to hear.

377
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,360
You just need to be patient.

378
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,080
Fuhui.

379
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,480
Kangning was busy
in the kitchen at the crack of dawn.

380
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,080
When the mistress woke up,
she felt the warm stove ashes

381
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,920
and almost thought a thief came overnight.

382
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,760
Don't be nosy.

383
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,320
Kangning really thought of everything.

384
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,200
Let's go.

385
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,520
PAN RESTAURANT

386
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,000
Have you heard?

387
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,480
His Majesty issued a decree,

388
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,240
stripping Yang Xian of his position,

389
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,960
forcing him home
to reflect on his actions.

390
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,720
Fortunately, his father resigned quickly,

391
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,920
so he avoided being charged.

392
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,480
Otherwise, he would be punished
for allowing his son's bad deeds too.

393
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,560
I doubt Yang Xian will reemerge
for at least a year or two.

394
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,280
As expected.

395
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,240
Brother, your foresight is unmatched!

396
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
I'm impressed.

397
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,120
Even my wife couldn't stop
praising you this time.

398
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
She treated me kindly for two whole days!

399
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,800
Look at how little it takes to please you.

400
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,400
You only thank him!
Why don't you thank me?

401
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,320
Why should I thank you?

402
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,040
Women need

403
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,600
to be kept in check.

404
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,560
They should not be allowed

405
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,360
to grow too arrogantly.

406
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,480
Kangning got a good scare this time.
She'll definitely behave from now on.

407
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,400
No more being spoiled and bothersome.

408
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,720
He told me he was looking
for some dreamlike beauty.

409
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,920
If it weren't for me directing
Yang Xian to the Li family,

410
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,920
how could he have found them so quickly?

411
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,120
Master Chai,

412
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,160
I've helped you
get your revenge this time.

413
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,040
- What are you saying?
- So, it was you!

414
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,760
- Well done!
- Kangning, you've misunderstood!

415
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,720
- Hear me out!
- A nest of snakes and rats!

416
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,000
Shameless scoundrel!

417
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,960
I'll deal with you when we're back!

418
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,520
Honey!

419
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,320
Cousin, it's over, it's over!

420
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,800
I don't need you to get me revenge!

421
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,440
- What a beautiful kite!
- So pretty, so pretty!

422
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,920
- I want this one.
- Maybe I should go buy it.

423
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
- What if…?
- Wasn't your head aching all night?

424
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,440
Let me go in your place.

425
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,760
You stay at the shop. I'll go help Mom.

426
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,560
Let's go.

427
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,480
Go, go, go.

428
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,400
Goodbye, dear customer.

429
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,080
Look at them, master and servant,
both born as ungrateful wretches.

430
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,040
To make this deal happen,
you let that Wang guy

431
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,240
scam you out of an ink slab
worth 40 strings of coins.

432
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,960
Without your discreet assistance,

433
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,000
they wouldn't have succeeded
and depended on fate.

434
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,160
Not even a word of thanks.
Their consciences must be entirely dead.

435
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,400
Sir, I've told you before,

436
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,160
it doesn't pay to be a good person.

437
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,840
I did it for the Fan family
and for my cousin.

438
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,200
Do you think I did it for her?

439
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,320
Do you think I want her thanks?

440
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,360
Yes, yes, you don't care.

441
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,160
If you don't care, why are you looking?

442
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,160
- Who gave you permission to mess around?
- I was wrong.

443
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,600
- Get lost. Do something!
- This way.

444
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,560
Goodbye.

445
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,400
This way, please.

446
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,880
- Please.
- Ungrateful wretches.

447
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,960
Goodbye, dear customer.

448
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,280
Sir, are you looking to buy something?

449
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,800
Pick out some premium sandalwood for me.
Do you have any?

450
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,840
Young lady.

451
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,920
Don't be afraid, young lady.

452
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I was ignorant and rude
at the Fan family's residence.

453
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,600
Here, I sincerely apologize.

454
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,160
I'm sorry, truly sorry.

455
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,040
We do have sandalwood.

456
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,840
Wait here.

457
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,160
Master Chai!

458
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,400
Master Chai, listen to me! Master Chai!

459
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,760
I'm not lending it. Get out!

460
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,880
Master Chai, I stood up for you,
and now you treat me like an enemy?

461
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,080
This is so unfair!

462
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,240
Who said I did it for the Li family?

463
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,920
I just can't stand the sight of you.

464
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Don't linger in front of me.
Deqing, drag him out!

465
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,680
Master Liang, please leave.

466
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,840
Master Chai, does it really
have to come to this?

467
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
What's going on here? What's happening?

468
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,600
Master Fan, please intervene.
Master Chai's forbidden me from returning.

469
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,440
Without the fine wine
of the Pan Restaurant, how will I survive?

470
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,160
Serves you right, you fool!

471
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,880
Gossiping behind the scenes

472
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,640
and causing all this trouble. My knees
are sore from kneeling because of you.

473
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,120
Brother, he's at fault,
but not to the point of death.

474
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,800
Back when Pan Restaurant
hosted a wine party,

475
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,640
he begged endlessly to have
the best courtesan attend.

476
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,520
He ran himself ragged for a whole month,

477
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,880
so perhaps he's made up for his mistakes.

478
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,280
Spare him this once, for my sake.

479
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,080
Shameless.

480
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,560
You're too good at playing the nice guy.

481
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,000
It's always me taking the blame,
while you reap the benefits.

482
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,400
Who dares defy you, brother?
I'll go reason with him.

483
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,680
I bet you don't have the guts.

484
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,440
Master Chai, you promised me last time

485
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,520
to lend me that jade comb.

486
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,400
Why is he so snippy?
Who upset him this time?

487
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,360
- It's Kangning.
- Deqing!

488
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,080
What priceless comb could tempt

489
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,920
even a spoiled noble

490
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,240
like you?

491
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,560
Three years ago, I came across

492
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,560
a rare piece of fine lamb-fat jade.

493
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
I had it carved into a comb,
not worth much.

494
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,000
Listen to this!

495
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,080
That thousand-year cold jade,
mined from beneath an icy river,

496
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,960
sculpted by master artisans,
is worth tens of thousands.

497
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,760
And he calls it "not worth much".

498
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,040
Sir, Master Liu has been waiting
for quite some time.

499
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,080
I forgot. Let's set this aside for now.

500
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
Don't!

501
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,480
Last time, my mother saw

502
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,160
Madam Chai wearing it at Xiangguo Temple.

503
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,320
She was so envious.

504
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,520
Let me borrow it to have a replica made
to ease her mind.

505
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,560
Master Chai,
my mother's birthday is next month.

506
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,080
- I'm begging you, brother.
- Fine, fine.

507
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,320
- Deqing, fetch it for him.
- Yes.

508
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,800
Thank you, Master Chai.

509
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,760
Your master has spoken. Hurry up.

510
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,200
Pleasing one's elders is important.

511
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,720
Last time, I promised
Lady Lu to lend it to her,

512
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,080
so she could enjoy wearing it for a while.
A promise is a promise.

513
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,200
When I bought these, I was puzzled.

514
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,280
Well, Four Harmonies can be made
with sandalwood and musk.

515
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,160
Why buy dried cypress leaves and coptis?
We're not running an apothecary!

516
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,960
Sandalwood, agarwood,

517
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,520
borneol, and musk make

518
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,680
the premium Four Harmonies.

519
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,320
Those are sold to high-ranking officials
and wealthy merchants.

520
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,360
But I use Maoshan coptis

521
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,160
and dried cypress leaves,

522
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,080
lycée shells, and sugarcane residue
to create humble Four Harmonies

523
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,320
tailored for those literati who love
to flaunt their refined taste.

524
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,960
That's what I call a win-win situation!

525
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
Pass me the pear juice.

526
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,920
People say I'm smart,
but that's because they haven't met you.

527
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,480
You seem kind and gentle,
but when you scheme against others,

528
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,120
you're truly ruthless.
Isn't that right, Qiongnu?

529
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,120
Who says impoverished scholars
can't use Four Harmonies?

530
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,800
When hosting guests,
one must treat everyone equally.

531
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,560
I was wrong. I was wrong, sister!

532
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,240
Adding dried tangerine peel
and pine nut shells would make it better.

533
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,720
Qiongnu, that pendant is quite unique.
I haven't seen you wear it before.

534
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,480
Qiongnu?

535
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,040
Just something from a street vendor.
It cost only ten coins. It's cheap beads.

536
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,040
Qiongnu,

537
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,240
go to the kitchen
and boil some water for me.

538
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,920
I want to soak my feet later.

539
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,960
Right away.

540
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,960
Here, have a look.

541
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,760
Is there anything you like?

542
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,120
Mom,

543
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,720
stop bossing Qiongnu around.
She's not a servant.

544
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,400
When she fled to us during the famine,

545
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,480
she only had a pair
of broken straw sandals.

546
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,360
Aside from fleas and lice,

547
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,280
she had nothing.

548
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,080
I've fed and clothed her all these years,

549
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,800
raising her to adulthood.

550
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,440
Isn't that kindness enough?

551
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,960
If I don't have her do any work,

552
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,120
should I start worshiping her
like an ancestor instead?

553
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,920
What nonsense are you spouting?

554
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,800
Look at this.

555
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,440
A young lady should wear red.

556
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,920
It makes her look prettier.

557
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,360
- Mom!
- Don't take it off!

558
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,720
Leave it for my sister. It's not for me.

559
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,560
You're still hung up
on that heartless man?

560
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,720
You're in the prime of your youth.

561
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,280
Why waste it?

562
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,760
I'm telling you,

563
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,160
I've found a good matchmaker for Fuhui.

564
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,040
She's arranged meetings
with many suitable families.

565
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,880
Soon, we'll go visit each one.
Put it on, put it on!

566
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,520
Mom.

567
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,360
- Come on.
- What?

568
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,600
Sit.

569
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,840
Mother looks best with flowers.

570
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,920
- No, no, no!
- Don't move!

571
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,440
- Why wear that?
- It's a waste.

572
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,240
Don't! Alright, alright.

573
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,000
Look at that.

574
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,160
You're prettier
than the flowers themselves!

575
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,000
It does look nice.

576
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,960
Back in the day,

577
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,640
I was as radiant as a peony.

578
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,840
Sister, why is Master Liang here again?

579
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,680
Be careful on the road.

580
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,160
Let's go.

581
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,000
Alright, I'll take this string of beads.

582
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,600
My lady, you're in luck.
This was sent by someone on your behalf.

583
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,840
I don't usually care about such matters…

584
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,800
but Liang Junqing is a regular patron
at the Pan Restaurant.

585
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,480
My ties with him are superficial.
We're not alike.

586
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,120
If I let her misunderstand me any further,
it'll damage my reputation.

587
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,440
After all, we're somewhat related,
and there will be future interaction.

588
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,160
Actually, not really related at all.

589
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,960
Yes, yes, you're absolutely right.

590
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,520
Once Li Kangning comes,
the misunderstanding will be cleared up.

591
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,720
- She should be thanking you.
- Is she really that reasonable?

592
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,920
I don't think so.

593
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,200
Make way. Selling flowers!

594
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,520
Come take a look!

595
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,720
Move along.

596
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,920
Rejecting one after another.

597
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,800
What are you looking for,
a top scholar or a military champion?

598
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,320
My lady,

599
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,760
those last two…

600
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,080
One was timid and hesitant,

601
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,560
the other overly pretentious.

602
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,440
Neither is worth considering.

603
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,120
How can a skilled lady
match with an incompetent man?

604
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,800
They went to discuss a match.

605
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,840
Exactly, exactly.
You sharp-tongued girl understand.

606
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,520
I'm stuck in a mess, aren't I?

607
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,760
Well, they just weren't born

608
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,200
into wealth, were they?

609
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,360
Well, you're the best mother in the world.

610
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,240
I don't want another family,
even if there is plenty of wealth.

611
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,440
Such sweet talk.

612
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,640
I must've owed you in a past life.

613
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,720
Alright, alright. Reject them if you must.

614
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,760
Surely, not all the fine men
in Bianjing are gone.

615
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,560
We'll keep looking.

616
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,920
You look nervous.
What are you running off to do now?

617
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,760
Mother, they're selling
fish maw soup on the main street.

618
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,800
Fifth lady…

619
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,640
You're all like a hungry ghost!

620
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,040
Take it, take it!

621
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,880
Too much!

622
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,240
If you don't want to eat, fine.
I'll save a few coins.

623
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,040
Mom wants you to buy a bowl too.
Go on, go on.

624
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,400
She looks so gloomy, like a gray sparrow.

625
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,000
It's infuriating just to look at her.

626
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,800
Sir, sir!

627
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,320
Sir!

628
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,160
Didn't you want to find Li Kangning
and get an explanation?

629
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,280
She's a girl from a lowly household.
If I go to explain, it'll inflate her ego.

630
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,440
I refuse to give her that satisfaction.

631
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,000
If you try to persuade me again,
I'll hit you too!

632
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,120
I thought that water puppet show
last time was quite novel.

633
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,520
Find the performers
and have them perform in my restaurant.

634
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,480
This token serves as proof.
Now you can be assured.

635
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,960
I'm just the middleman.
Whether you come or not is your decision.

636
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,320
Qiongnu!

637
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,800
Qiongnu!

638
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,920
What's the matter?

639
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,280
Shouhua, has Qiongnu returned?

640
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,280
What task did Mom send her on this time?

641
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,680
As soon as Mom came back,
she went to the front to tend to business.

642
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,880
Haode and Leshan
went to watch the water puppets,

643
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,920
but I didn't see her.

644
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,720
What's this?

645
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,160
I noticed her sleeve was worn, so I picked
out some clothes I rarely wear.

646
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,920
The colors are to her liking.

647
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,920
Don't tell me
you secretly made something new again,

648
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,960
claiming they're old clothes
just to deceive Mom.

649
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,920
Fuhui sent some new fabric.
I can't wear it all.

650
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,840
Don't tell Mom, okay?

651
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,760
I also have a new pair of shoes,
just made and unworn.

652
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,720
Give those to her too.

653
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,440
You two are so kind,

654
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,560
but she might not even appreciate it.

655
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,520
Such a fine restaurant.

656
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,560
It's not some shabby
street performance venue.

657
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,400
Why bring in water puppets, flesh puppets,
any puppets to steal my business?

658
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,440
That Chai family has no decent people.

659
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,040
Mom, you're back. Sit down and rest.

660
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,640
My whole body aches.

661
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,800
Ms. Liu, come here and massage me.

662
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,640
Sir, the Li family's fourth and fifth
ladies are outside watching water puppets.

663
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,960
Li Kangning isn't there, though.

664
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,200
<i>She's powdered her face</i>
<i>and adorned herself with flowers.</i>

665
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,440
<i>Who knows who she's meeting?</i>

666
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,480
Sir!

667
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,600
The more I think of it, the angrier I get.
Never I've been treated this way.

668
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,240
I must make things clear to her
or I won't swallow this anger.

669
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,720
Sir, it's not appropriate
to visit her household at this hour.

670
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,240
She's an unmarried young lady.

671
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,320
You'd be thrown out by Madam Li
before you'd say a word.

672
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,960
It's all that Liang fellow's fault.

673
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,360
Tomorrow, go to Liang's house
and demand my jade comb back!

674
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,440
Did you hear me?

675
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,880
Qiongnu!

676
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,280
Tell me.

677
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,080
Where have you been?

678
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,800
- Shouhua!
- Speak up!

679
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,680
- What's going on now?
- Say it, and I won't hit you.

680
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,600
Tell me!

681
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,800
Where exactly were you this late at night?

682
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,440
Seriously, I'm angry to death. Speak up!

683
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,720
- Go to bed!
- But…

684
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,960
Your rooms are close.
Leshan must've heard it too.

685
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,680
Chunlai, stay here and keep watch.

686
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,080
Let's go and check.

687
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,400
Speak!

688
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,160
What happened? Tell me!

689
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,000
What respectable girl
runs out in the dead of night?

690
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,760
You useless thing!

691
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,760
I've raised you for nothing
all these years!

692
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,240
How long have you even been in Bianjing,
and you've already caused this trouble?

693
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,440
Tell me.

694
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,800
Which rathole
did the scoundrel come from?

695
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,160
That immoral, shameless bastard!

696
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,000
Who lured you into such disgraceful deeds?

697
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,640
Tell me!

698
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,040
If you tell me, I won't hit you.

699
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,640
I'll just go settle the score with him.

700
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,440
Speak! Tell me!

701
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,840
Who was it

702
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,040
that led you into this filthy act,

703
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,600
tarnishing our family's reputation?

704
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,280
Speak! Who was it?

705
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,920
Fine, you won't say?

706
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
- I'll beat you.
- Mom!

707
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,920
- Will you speak?
- Mom!

708
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,320
- Mom!
- Speak or not!

709
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,880
Don't get angry.
Let's talk this through.

710
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,440
Mom, come rest in my room.

711
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,240
You're too old to be getting so worked up.

712
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,520
Let me tell you.

713
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,040
I truly regret it.

714
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,760
I should never have taken you in.

715
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,760
Mom, go rest in my room for now.

716
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,040
We'll come back to question you later.

717
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,680
Mom!

718
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,120
I should never have taken her in.

719
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,120
If I hadn't taken her in,

720
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,720
my Fan'er wouldn't have drowned
in the river trying to save her.

721
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,320
He's nowhere to be found.
Not even the body is found.

722
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,320
Even now, I still dream of Fan'er

723
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,600
calling for me every night.

724
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,400
Kangning,

725
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,440
he's telling me,

726
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,480
"Mom,

727
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,440
save me!

728
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,640
It's so cold in the river.

729
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,600
Mom,

730
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,400
save me. I want to go home."

731
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,640
My poor Fan'er.

732
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,280
If only he were still here.

733
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,040
If he were here,

734
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,920
those heartless people
wouldn't think our Li family

735
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,320
is doomed to die out.

736
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,800
They wouldn't gang up to bully
us orphans and a widow.

737
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,240
Nor would they force
your elder sister to marry

738
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,960
a sickly, short-lived man.

739
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,720
When they couldn't take our wealth,

740
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,440
they called us a family of six tigers,

741
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,800
ruining your reputations.

742
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,120
They forced us to leave our home

743
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,320
and come to Bianjing to scrape by.

744
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,880
If only my poor Fan'er were still here,

745
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,480
how wonderful that would be.

746
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,840
Mom,

747
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,240
we searched the riverbanks back then

748
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,920
but never found a body.

749
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,440
If he was lucky enough to be rescued,

750
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,200
who knows…

751
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,280
Yes, Mom. I'm his twin.

752
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,920
All these years,
I've always felt he was still alive.

753
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,240
Don't try to comfort me.

754
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,040
If he were still alive,

755
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,560
why hasn't he come home?

756
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,000
Why hasn't he come home?

757
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,880
Something terrible!

758
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,720
Something terrible has happened!

759
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,320
She hanged herself!

760
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,840
Why did you save me?

761
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,400
You should've just let me die.

762
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,200
When we were kids, you, me, and my brother

763
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,320
used to play together all the time.

764
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,720
I didn't like playing with you
because you were slow.

765
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,000
But he always protected you.

766
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,360
He was my twin brother!

767
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,600
Even when he was gone,
I still treated you like a sister-in-law.

768
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,000
Whatever good food or toys I had,
I never forgot to share with you.

769
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,000
And now,

770
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,360
you want to leave too?

771
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,200
You won't even say goodbye?

772
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,640
Kangning,

773
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,960
I lost my father when I was three.

774
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,880
My birth mother, who was just a concubine,
took my dowry and rushed to remarry.

775
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,320
She saw me as a burden

776
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,720
and left me with others.

777
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,200
If it weren't for me,

778
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,760
you wouldn't have lost your brother.

779
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,360
Yes,

780
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,040
you owe my son a life. What right
do you have to take your own life?

781
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,960
If you really want to die,
pay your debt first!

782
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,760
Silly child, this is such a small matter.

783
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,600
Look at Madam Wang,
the fabric seller on the corner.

784
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,680
She's remarried four times,
and she's still living well.

785
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,640
Chastity means nothing!

786
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,920
Seeking death over something so trivial,

787
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
how foolish can you be?

788
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,560
You grew up in the Li family.

789
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,800
Mom loves you like a daughter
since you were little.

790
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,960
She may speak harshly,

791
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,040
but she's secretly
been saving up a dowry for you.

792
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,320
Don't do anything stupid again.

793
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,640
Mom, I was wrong.

794
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,800
I was truly wrong.

795
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,280
Mom!

796
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,400
He didn't succeed.
He didn't really succeed.

797
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,800
I hit him over the head with a vase,

798
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,160
and I ran away myself.

799
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,160
I was just furious,

800
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,680
afraid he'd spread rumors outside
and ruin the reputation of our sisters.

801
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,800
But what I feared most was…

802
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,440
I was scared you wouldn't want me anymore.

803
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,880
Alright, alright, stop crying.

804
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,280
Silly child.

805
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:39,840
Don't cry anymore.

806
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,160
Wipe those tears away.

807
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,680
Is it too hot?

808
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,520
My lady!

809
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,320
What now?

810
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,440
The Chai family.

811
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,200
Someone from the Chai family
has come to claim the jade comb.

812
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,360
Sir, why not have that Liang fellow
come and retrieve it himself?

813
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,760
Why bother visiting in person?

814
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,440
Master Chai, your sudden visit,
is there something important?

815
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,560
You're truly rude. No tea, no water,
and you didn't invite us to the hall.

816
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,560
Is this how one treats a guest?

817
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,600
I heard someone in your household
picked up my jade comb.

818
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,160
I've come specifically to reclaim it.

819
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,040
There are plenty of jade combs.

820
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,880
What does yours look like?

821
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,480
A comb carved
from thousand-year cold jade,

822
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,840
engraved with floral and bird patterns,
extremely delicate.

823
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,080
It was originally worn in the hair.

824
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,360
I lent it to someone to admire,

825
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,800
but it was lost in the Sweetwater Alley
on East Second Street.

826
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,360
I heard someone
in your family picked it up.

827
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,280
If it was clearly seen being taken,
why didn't you ask for it right away?

828
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,400
Isn't that why
I've come personally to retrieve it?

829
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,960
Any other jade comb wouldn't matter,

830
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,800
but this was my mother's
treasured possession.

831
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,240
Could you please return it now?

832
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,280
So, you're certain
this jade comb is yours?

833
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:23,760
Of course, it is!

834
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,120
What are you doing?

835
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,560
Return your comb!

836
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,880
Li Kangning, stop right there!
What's the meaning of this, Li Kangning?

837
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,640
Li Kangning!

838
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,760
Kangning, explain yourself!

839
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,440
You can't just barge
into a woman's chambers!

840
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,400
Kangning, what's going on this time?

841
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,120
Master Chai, please stop here.

842
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,120
- Kangning has--
- The jade comb has been returned.

843
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,960
Master Chai, please leave.

844
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,320
- Madam Li!
- See him out.

845
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,440
Madam Li!

846
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,400
Li Kangning, Li Kangning!

847
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,680
Kangning, tell me clearly.

848
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,920
What's going on this time, Kangning?

849
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:21,920
This family is truly insane!

850
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,200
Hurry, sir!

851
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,760
The big matriarch of the Li family
really might eat someone alive!

852
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,040
Disgraceful!

853
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,320
