EPISODE 24

2
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,600
Ah Zheng, the first time we met,

3
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,560
you wouldn't let go of me.

4
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,080
I know you've got a grievance, right?

5
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,720
Twice the case was retried.

6
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,360
You still wouldn't reveal the truth.

7
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,280
Is someone threatening you?

8
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,320
Or are they too powerful?

9
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,280
Afraid your family will suffer?

10
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,080
Do you have a theory, my lord?

11
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,280
You've thought of it too, right?

12
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,240
It must be a rich merchant

13
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,400
or a high-ranked official.

14
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,200
We must find the one
who truly terrifies her.

15
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,800
Only then will we uncover the culprit.

16
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,120
Even if she can't speak,

17
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,520
she could've signaled somehow.

18
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,720
But she was too scared

19
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,960
to testify.

20
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,000
It was busy with people that day.

21
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,760
So many officers and workers passing by.

22
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,160
Why did she only plead to Haode?

23
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,360
And why stop once we showed up?

24
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,080
That's why I want Haode

25
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,200
to take another shot.

26
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,720
After you were taken,

27
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,800
Granny Zhang took her grandchild with her.

28
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,720
She did laundry jobs for neighbors,

29
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,240
barely earning 20 coins a day.

30
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,920
Now,

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,840
they've sold their countryside house
and came here.

32
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,840
But they're living in temples
or under bridges.

33
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,120
If you die,

34
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,480
they won't survive much longer.

35
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,840
Your last employer.

36
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,120
Did you sign a short-term contract?

37
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,360
Do you know where it was?

38
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,600
If not,

39
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,320
was there a plaque at the gate?

40
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,920
Even if you can't read,

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,520
you'd recognize the place, right?

42
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,720
Was it the Lu's House,

43
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,040
Wang's, or Li's?

44
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,520
Here,

45
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,040
point to the word

46
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,840
on this page for me.

47
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,640
Think carefully and show me.

48
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,000
FAMILY NAMES YU, REN, YUAN

49
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,400
FAMILY NAMES FEI, LIAN, CHEN

50
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,480
FAMILY NAMES XUE, LEI, HE

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,480
XUE

52
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,280
<i>She's timid and from the countryside.</i>

53
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,760
<i>She only worked and didn't wander.</i>

54
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,560
<i>She's unfamiliar</i>

55
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,800
<i>with Bianjing's roads.</i>

56
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,720
<i>She only knows the gate had the word Xue.</i>

57
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,480
XUE'S MANSION

58
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,640
XUE'S MANSION

59
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,160
XUE'S MANSION

60
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,800
My lord,

61
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,200
this is the last

62
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,480
Xue's house in Bianjing.

63
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,240
Let's head back.

64
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,520
No, it's not the last one.

65
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,000
- One more Xue family.
- Haode.

66
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,280
The Grand Justice, Xue Guang.

67
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,280
Doesn't he count?

68
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,520
Brother, we've searched every house.

69
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,520
Why skip this one?

70
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,520
Don't tell me

71
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,960
you don't trust him.

72
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,040
Fine.

73
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,600
Let's go back to Kaifeng Court

74
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,520
and execute her.

75
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,160
Pretend this never happened.

76
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,560
- Qingshi.
- I'm here.

77
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,800
Go to Xue's residence.

78
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,520
Sure.

79
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,560
Let's go.

80
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Sit here.

81
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,880
Get off.

82
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,600
Is this really the Xue residence?

83
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,200
He visited Kaifeng Court that day.

84
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,880
The next day, I paid him a visit here.

85
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,560
Yes, it's this place.

86
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,440
Jingwei.

87
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,520
Jingwei.

88
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,480
Sir.

89
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,280
Sir.

90
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,720
Have a seat.

91
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,000
I've been an official for 40 years.

92
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,760
I'm used to a modest lifestyle.

93
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,720
My diet's simple, my clothes plain.

94
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,800
This house is all I own.

95
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,520
For years, I've only had

96
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,360
one disabled old servant.

97
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,480
My wife and young child

98
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,720
live frugally with me.

99
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,880
This is our life.

100
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,520
With only three of us,

101
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,280
we don't need maids or servants.

102
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,040
I also fear a court official living here

103
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,800
might attract gossip

104
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,840
and shame.

105
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,160
So, I've never hung a plaque.

106
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,360
Someone needs proof.

107
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,080
So, I had no choice.

108
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,520
Forgive me for the intrusion.

109
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,480
No need to apologize.

110
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
I have nothing to hide.

111
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,960
I've never done anything
to feel guilty about.

112
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,880
So, I don't fear inspections.

113
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,240
Are you satisfied now?

114
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,560
Lord Xue, forgive my ignorance.

115
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,520
You're a sage.

116
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,160
No harm done.

117
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,720
Please, have some tea.

118
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,920
Try this.

119
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,920
I have duties to attend to.

120
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,680
I can't stay long to disturb you.

121
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,720
I'll visit another day

122
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,880
to apologize properly.

123
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,280
- Goodbye.
- Take care.

124
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,680
<i>She can't read.</i>

125
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,280
<i>What if she remembered wrong?</i>

126
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,840
<i>Which surnames look like "Xue"?</i>

127
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,600
<i>Which one?</i>

128
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,200
Qingshi.

129
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,800
Sir.

130
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,440
Tell Officer Du

131
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,240
this case can't be delayed.

132
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,000
If there's no solid proof,

133
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
then uphold the verdict.

134
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,840
Murdering her husband
deserves the death penalty.

135
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,520
Oh.

136
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,680
Keep investigating.

137
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,840
- Sure.
- Go.

138
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,120
XUE

139
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,400
Dad.

140
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,040
Is it okay now?

141
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,920
You disgraceful child!

142
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,720
My years of good name are ruined by you.

143
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,840
I regret spoiling you.

144
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,240
Now, you murder and commit sins!

145
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,040
Why do I even need a son like you?

146
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,360
Others are officials. So are you.

147
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,280
Others live in luxury.

148
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,440
But I've lived in this hut for 20 years.

149
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,960
Why can't I enjoy myself?

150
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,440
A lowly farmer died. So what?

151
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,640
If you kill me for this,

152
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,440
you'll cut off your bloodline.

153
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,480
You!

154
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,240
Kaifeng already sentenced her.

155
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,120
She won't appeal again.

156
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,520
But have you cleaned out
that private house yet?

157
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,760
Especially those
who aided and abetted you.

158
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,200
Well,

159
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,080
it's okay with that house.

160
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,280
But don't worry.

161
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,480
I'll handle them.

162
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,760
I also told someone

163
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,480
to remove the plaque.

164
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,760
Fool!

165
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,680
There are not so many Xue houses here.

166
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,880
Taking down the plaque now?
It's too suspicious!

167
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,840
Dad.

168
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,920
Dad. I'm your son.

169
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,120
Save me, please.

170
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,720
That Shen guy.

171
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,120
He's your student, right?

172
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,360
He'll listen to you!

173
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,360
And that magistrate.

174
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,560
He'll listen to you!

175
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,880
- Enough.
- Dad.

176
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,720
Are you just going to watch your son die?

177
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,280
I beg you, Dad.

178
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,120
Help me!

179
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,520
I didn't want to come.

180
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,480
Granny had my bedding moved.

181
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,240
Leshan and Yinhong are sharing a bed.

182
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,560
I couldn't go there too.

183
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,360
Don't mind me. You go to sleep.

184
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,680
<i>I said don't mind me,</i>

185
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,200
<i>and you really don't?</i>

186
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,200
Brother.

187
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,800
She's innocent.

188
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,600
She's innocent.

189
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,120
You asked me to check Xue Sizu.

190
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,080
I found a private house.

191
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,640
Hurry!

192
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,200
Hurry up!

193
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,800
Be careful.

194
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,040
<i>Who'd have thought</i>
<i>Lord Xue lives so simply.</i>

195
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,320
<i>Yet his son owns houses and keeps women.</i>

196
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,280
Apart from that, there's even a troupe.

197
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,960
Did Zheng Su'e confirm it?

198
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,960
Yes, sir.

199
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,160
We arrested the servants there.

200
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,440
They're being interrogated.

201
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
About that culprit, Xue Sizu,

202
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,000
should we arrest him now?

203
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,800
Leave it to me.

204
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,960
Sure.

205
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,200
Brother?

206
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,400
Why aren't you at Kaifeng Court today?

207
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,640
Ruining my embroidery here instead?

208
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,280
I'm done.

209
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm never going there.

210
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,120
Shouhua, does Du always tell you

211
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,240
what he thinks?

212
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,480
Well, actually,

213
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,280
he carries the weight

214
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,680
and makes decisions on his own,

215
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,400
never letting me worry.

216
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,440
People say couples should
be open with each other.

217
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,840
But how many truly are?

218
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,480
It's all guesswork.

219
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,920
Back and forth.

220
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,680
That guessing's part of the fun.

221
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,280
Otherwise, marriage would be dull.

222
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,120
Haode,

223
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,480
you're going to be Mrs. Shen now.

224
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,840
Just listen to your husband.

225
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,800
Zheng's life or death isn't your concern.

226
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,440
But I can't forget her.

227
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,840
They cut her tongue and broke her teeth.

228
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,200
She was so beautiful once.

229
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,680
Who could be so cruel?

230
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,640
You mean

231
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,920
someone tortured her to break her teeth?

232
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,880
Shouhua,

233
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
your ideas are genius.

234
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,280
Those scoundrels.

235
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,000
They all confessed.

236
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,920
Yangxi.

237
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,160
What's the occasion?

238
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,120
Everyone's here.

239
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,360
Greetings to you, Mr. Du.

240
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,880
You're back.

241
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,840
Yeah.

242
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,400
The Zheng Su'e case troubles them.

243
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,040
What case did you just say?

244
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,200
Why so excited?

245
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,080
It's not for young ladies to hear.

246
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,080
Don't listen to him.

247
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,160
It's just a love scandal.

248
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,320
Sit at Sifu House for a day,

249
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
you'll hear ten more.

250
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,480
Why can't you say?

251
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,440
That's just a ridiculous case.

252
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,160
A woman surnamed Gao

253
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,120
accused her neighbor of harassment.

254
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,000
But her evidence was hard to verify.

255
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,000
What evidence?

256
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,360
Ask your Shouhua.

257
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,600
I'm going to wash up.

258
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,360
Shouhua.

259
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,360
She said

260
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,520
Liusheng snuck into her house.

261
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,560
He harassed her when she was alone.

262
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,480
He even bit her left chest hard.

263
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,200
How can officers verify this?

264
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,440
So, how was the case solved?

265
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:54,360
Tell me what you did.

266
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,160
What do you think?

267
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,160
What?

268
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,960
Look,

269
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,600
checking a chest is tricky,

270
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,360
but bite marks on food aren't.

271
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,720
Match the teeth marks and it's clear.

272
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,160
That's brilliant.

273
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,560
You should become a magistrate.

274
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,240
No one will be framed then.

275
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
Where are you going?

276
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,520
Du,

277
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,040
what methods do courts use to coerce?

278
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,000
Would Zheng be forced into confession?

279
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,720
For women,

280
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,680
they use finger clamps or flogging.

281
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,040
But no more than 200 strikes by law.

282
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,800
If she endures,

283
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,640
they can't do anything.

284
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,680
Even if she falsely confesses,
later, when the higher courts intervene

285
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,720
and find out that she got beaten

286
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,360
over 100 strikes, when the rightful
punishment is only 20,

287
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,240
the magistrate
will take the rest themselves.

288
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,160
They call it reverse penalty.

289
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,240
Would they pull teeth?

290
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,480
An oral confession.
What's the good in that?

291
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,440
That would be a real false confession.

292
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,400
Thank you.

293
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,200
Haode.

294
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,160
Haode.

295
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,280
Haode.

296
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,720
Shouhua.

297
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,560
Are they…?

298
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,480
Let me.

299
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,840
Rare to see you resting today.

300
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,680
Instead of taking your wife out,

301
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,200
you came and visited me.

302
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,520
I don't have fine food for you,

303
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,960
but I made these preserves.

304
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,560
I made them with imperial fruits.

305
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,920
Here, have a taste.

306
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,400
You are a good teacher.

307
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,920
You care about me a lot.

308
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,200
Today, I'll take this tea

309
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,480
to show my respect.

310
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,040
We're teacher and student,
like father and son.

311
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,080
Why can't you just speak plainly?

312
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,880
No need to be vague and evasive.

313
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,920
Pardon my boldness.

314
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,200
May I ask, Lord Xue?

315
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,720
If a nobleman in the city

316
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,640
abuses power and breaks laws
under his father's authority,

317
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,640
shouldn't he be held accountable?

318
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,680
What exactly did he do?

319
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,440
He seized a maid named Ah Zheng,

320
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,720
killed her husband,

321
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,000
pinned the murder on another,

322
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,920
and ordered the county magistrate

323
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,440
to cut out Ah Zheng's tongue.

324
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,640
His actions are vile and cruel,

325
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,080
depraved, heinous,

326
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,200
beyond redemption.

327
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,040
Lord Shen,

328
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,040
do you know how many cases

329
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,200
I've handled?

330
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,400
Even I've lost count.

331
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,440
Can't my decades of merit

332
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,400
be exchanged for his life?

333
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,000
It's never hard to judge a case…

334
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,840
but people's hearts.

335
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,800
Last night,

336
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,600
I kept thinking about this.

337
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,520
The law was created based on human nature.

338
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,600
Then the exceptions by human emotions

339
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,040
are selfish desires.

340
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,520
Unchecked feelings lead to injustice.

341
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,200
Unchecked greed leads to chaos.

342
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,080
When facing these exceptions,

343
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,560
those who judge the cases

344
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,040
should never be compromised.

345
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,560
I hope you understand, Lord Xue.

346
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,320
Sir, the young master
still insists on going.

347
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,640
He's testing my patience.

348
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,560
My lord,

349
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,000
you can protect him.

350
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,760
<i>Yes, I can protect him.</i>

351
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,680
<i>But compared to a reputation</i>
<i>I've built for decades,</i>

352
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,280
<i>an heir means little to me.</i>

353
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,080
You've met that man,

354
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,640
haven't you?

355
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,880
That day, you weren't scared
because Lord Shen arrived.

356
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,120
You were scared

357
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,760
because you saw Xue Guang.

358
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,920
You're afraid of him.

359
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,720
Perhaps you saw him at the manor,

360
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,760
knew he's a high-ranked official,

361
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,920
so you couldn't cry for justice.

362
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,320
Father, why are you here?

363
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,760
Who let you set up a private house here?

364
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,520
Father, let's talk inside.

365
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,720
Oh heavens.

366
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,600
I see now.

367
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,120
Your teeth

368
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,960
weren't pulled during interrogation.

369
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,000
They were knocked out

370
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,640
while resisting assault.

371
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,800
I know

372
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,600
you don't trust the officials.

373
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,080
But my husband isn't like them.

374
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,920
If you trust me,

375
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,760
trust him too.

376
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,480
Brother, I've found evidence
against the killer.

377
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,400
I heard from Qingshi. Well done.

378
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,160
You really went to the Xue house?

379
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,200
And told him about it?

380
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,080
He's Lord Xue's only son.

381
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,160
If it were me, I'd let him escape.

382
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,160
But he's the Grand Justice.

383
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,680
He can't violate the law knowingly.

384
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,720
It's precisely
because Lord Xue knows the law

385
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,160
that his crimes cause even more harm.

386
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,200
Sir, Lord Xue and his son are here

387
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,640
to turn themselves in.

388
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,120
Bring them to court.

389
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,560
Yang Zigao,

390
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,040
the magistrate summons you.

391
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,360
JUSTICE PREVAILS

392
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,600
Zheng Su'e,

393
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,640
look at these four men carefully.

394
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,520
Among them,

395
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,920
which one killed your husband?

396
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,320
SILENCE

397
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,520
Audacious woman.

398
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,560
You don't even know me,

399
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,800
yet you accuse me?
Think it can clear your name?

400
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,720
The three of you, leave.

401
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,520
On March 16th last year,

402
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,360
<i>you took Zheng into your manor as a maid.</i>

403
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,640
<i>You coveted her beauty,</i>

404
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,960
<i>constantly harassing her.</i>

405
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,680
<i>But Zheng was virtuous</i>

406
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,000
<i>and firmly refused.</i>

407
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,440
<i>On April 3rd,</i>

408
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,600
<i>to avoid your abuse,</i>

409
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,800
<i>Zheng fled back home alone.</i>

410
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,680
<i>Had you stopped then,</i>

411
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,480
<i>you might've redeemed yourself.</i>

412
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,520
<i>But instead,</i>

413
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,000
<i>you followed her.</i>

414
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,520
<i>On Buddha's birthday, April 8th,</i>

415
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
<i>when Granny Zhang</i>
<i>left to pray at the temple,</i>

416
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,280
<i>you broke into her house again.</i>

417
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,120
<i>Zheng resisted your advances.</i>

418
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,440
<i>In anger, you struck her</i>

419
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,360
<i>and broke one of her teeth.</i>

420
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,640
<i>Her husband, Zhang Min,</i>
<i>hearing her screams,</i>

421
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,200
<i>rushed in with a knife to save her.</i>

422
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,840
<i>You and two servants</i>

423
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,440
<i>killed him.</i>

424
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,040
<i>What Lord Shen claims</i>

425
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,080
is baseless conjecture.

426
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,360
Where's the evidence?

427
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,000
Bring in Han Neng and Wang Hong.

428
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,640
Han Neng, Wang Hong,
both are your servants.

429
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,000
They've confessed everything.

430
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,560
Don't tell me you don't know them.

431
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,720
These two are indeed my servants.

432
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,800
But days ago,

433
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,200
I drove them out

434
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,720
for stealing silverware.

435
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,560
They hold a grudge

436
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,400
and made this up.

437
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,960
What are you talking about?

438
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,280
We had no quarrel with Zhang.

439
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,880
Why would we kill him?

440
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,800
My lord,

441
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,840
the silverware was his bribe to us.

442
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,120
It was hush money, I swear.

443
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,120
That silverware was my mother's treasure.

444
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,280
How could I just give it away?

445
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,000
If you don't believe me,
search their homes.

446
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,040
You'll see.

447
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,880
I even reported the theft back then.

448
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,600
It was too trivial

449
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,880
to trouble you with.

450
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,760
So,

451
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,440
they framed you for firing them?

452
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,360
Why would the magistrate

453
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,080
cut her tongue?

454
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,720
Bring in Yang Zigao.

455
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
My lord.

456
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,440
Yang Zigao died in custody.

457
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,520
Lord Shen, apart from these two servants,

458
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,600
if there's no other proof,

459
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,840
I must leave for a lecture at the academy.

460
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,320
I'll take my leave.

461
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,240
SILENCE

462
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,120
- Let go!
- You husband-killing wretch!

463
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,080
I'll cut you to pieces!

464
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,000
Pull her back.

465
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,880
Stop!

466
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,440
Pull them back.

467
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,240
Zheng said she bit

468
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,160
the killer's left shoulder.

469
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,640
Guards.

470
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,960
Check his shoulder.

471
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,480
Shen Huizhao!

472
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,600
My father treated you as family.

473
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,760
How dare you betray him?

474
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,920
You heartless snake.

475
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,560
Do it.

476
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,000
SILENCE

477
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,920
My lord,

478
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,440
the old and new bite marks match.

479
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,360
Even the broken tooth aligns perfectly.

480
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,040
Xue Sizu, how dare you!

481
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,920
You deny knowing Zheng Su'e,

482
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,400
so how did she know about your bite mark?

483
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
Confess,
or you'll be flogged to death here.

484
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,520
Brother,

485
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,680
did Lord Xue truly know nothing

486
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,640
of his son's actions?

487
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,080
My lifesaver!

488
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,080
Please, no need for this. Get up.

489
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,640
No, no, take it back.

490
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,480
Take it.

491
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,880
Go home and live a good life.

492
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,040
Escort them safely home, then report back.

493
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,120
Understood.

494
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,400
You saved them.

495
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,360
Why are you crying?

496
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,120
I don't know.

497
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,640
All those wronged will be compensated.
They'll be given coins and cloths.

498
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,600
Once they're home,

499
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,680
life will better.

500
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,440
But I just feel like crying.

501
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,400
Then cry for a bit.

502
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,800
Cover your eyes
with some soaked packs later.

503
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,480
We came for hiking,

504
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,320
not for tears.

505
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,960
Granny might think I upset you.

506
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,280
Okay,

507
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,280
let's go back.

508
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,400
Brother.

509
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,640
That's it?

510
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,400
I need more consolation.

511
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,800
Didn't you promise Granny

512
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,280
you'd take me to hike?

513
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,440
I gave you the choice.

514
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,600
You chose to see them off.

515
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,360
But brother…

516
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,960
Then have tea with me
before we leave, right?

517
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,800
If not, buy me some lamb skewers.

518
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,720
That works too! Please?

519
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,160
Brother, I'm starving.

520
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,600
I'm begging you.

521
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,480
This looks nice, so fresh!

522
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,840
Smells amazing.

523
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,640
Miss, take a look.

524
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,560
Homegrown.

525
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,640
Stop the cart.

526
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,040
Stop.

527
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,160
- All good!
- Pick some fresh ones for me.

528
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,200
This is good, right?

529
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,160
Take your time.

530
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,520
I like this one.

531
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,400
Sir,

532
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,400
take your pick.

533
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,040
Try this one for me. Looks nice.

534
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,880
- Okay.
- Is it good?

535
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,760
- Sure.
- How about this one on me?

536
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,280
Here, try it.

537
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,400
Let me see.

538
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,920
Nice taste, sir.

539
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,520
This jade ring is finely crafted.

540
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,160
The paired ducks symbolize love.

541
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,520
A perfect gift for your wife.

542
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,720
Everyone loves it.

543
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,680
This one suits you well too.

544
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,880
This bracelet's lovely.

545
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,480
I'll take this one.

546
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,400
Wrap this up.

547
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,560
Of course, right away.

548
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,240
No need for that.

549
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,840
Snap out of it.

550
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,800
Haode, yesterday,

551
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,200
did something nice happen?

552
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,080
Nothing special.

553
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,480
Then, tell me

554
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,960
why you're giggling like this.

555
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,080
I'm not giggling.

556
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,920
My lady, the old lady sent a gift.

557
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,200
Some fine bird's nest

558
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,880
and fresh porridge.

559
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,600
It's just been cooked.

560
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,640
- Leave it here.
- Sure.

561
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,760
Did she hear everything?

562
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,760
She's already suspicious.

563
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,080
Always probing for answers.

564
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,920
Now she has proof.

565
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,080
What is she going to do?

566
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,800
She's going to tell them!

567
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,480
Just now,

568
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,680
outside her room, I heard them.

569
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,040
She said that's her sister.

570
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,040
Jinming Pool is bustling today.

571
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,400
Boats and performances are everywhere.

572
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,520
Those swinging on water swings.

573
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,080
They look like they're flying in the wind.

574
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,760
It's even livelier than previous years.

575
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,920
You have a day off.

576
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,480
Take your new wife out for a stroll.

577
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,680
Don't let

578
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,440
your young bride feel bored.

579
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,600
You're right, Granny.

580
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,520
My grandson,

581
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,480
you always agree but never act on it.

582
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,440
Every time I ask you to go out,

583
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,000
you sulk and look so gloomy.

584
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,280
It's hard to tell
if it's an outing or a funeral.

585
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,480
With this attitude,

586
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,400
when will I see my great-grandkids?

587
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,280
Granny, I'm here to greet you.

588
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,400
Come in.

589
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,160
Best wishes, Granny.

590
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,280
Oh, you're here too?

591
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,960
And this is?

592
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,280
I must apologize, Granny.

593
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,960
When I visited my family,

594
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,440
I told them

595
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,040
how kind you are to me.

596
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,440
You treat me like family.

597
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,080
But my sister didn't believe me.

598
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,720
She said no in-laws could be so lenient.

599
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,080
She thought it wasn't real.

600
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,920
I invited her here, but she hesitated.

601
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,960
She said she needed to disguise herself

602
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,520
as a maid to test it.

603
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,520
Now, she finally believes me.

604
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,440
That such kind,

605
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,200
understanding elders exist.

606
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,000
She changed clothes to greet you.

607
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,720
Please forgive her boldness, Granny.

608
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,640
She wanted to report this earlier,

609
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,600
but I told her to wait and observe longer.

610
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,440
Since you spoke so highly of Granny,

611
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,280
our family must live up to your words.

612
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,040
Invite someone to test us,

613
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,160
so the truth can be spread.

614
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,360
You make it sound like I seek praise.

615
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,120
That's why

616
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,560
I thought this girl resembled you,

617
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,600
and now I know she's family.

618
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,440
Granny,

619
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,440
I followed my sister's carriage here.

620
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,240
She was shocked
and wanted to send me back.

621
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,200
I insisted on staying, no matter what.

622
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,600
Please don't blame her for hiding this.

623
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,240
You all kept this from me so well.

624
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,280
Who says I'm not upset?

625
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,080
Come here quickly.

626
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,360
I love cheerful, flower-like girls.

627
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,880
You should

628
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,200
stay here longer.

629
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,840
Keep your sister company

630
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,360
and amuse me.

631
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,120
Consider it making up for your offense.

632
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,720
Another day,

633
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,880
we'll go out together.

634
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,320
Granny,

635
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,120
I still have work at the office.

636
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,600
I can't be with you.

637
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,760
I'm sorry.

638
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,120
Who's asking you to come along?

639
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,200
You're such a buzzkill every day.

640
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,600
Haode, accompany me instead.

641
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,600
Sure.

642
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,880
This way.

643
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,160
Liu, a word with you.

644
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,320
Sure.

645
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,280
Anything happening in her room,
small or big,

646
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,080
will be learned by Granny

647
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,240
within an hour.

648
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,080
You've had a bias against my wife.

649
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,080
You often spoke ill of her before Granny.

650
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,400
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

651
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,080
Master,

652
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,680
I only did it for you

653
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,920
and this family.

654
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,200
I have no selfish intent.

655
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,040
You claim to serve Granny loyally,

656
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,040
but instead,

657
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:36,000
you stir trouble and gossip.

658
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:40,480
You spy on your masters
yet call yourself a devoted servant?

659
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,080
She's my wife.

660
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,240
Whether she's good or bad,

661
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,320
she is not someone for you to judge.

662
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,560
There's no place for you.

663
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,080
Find a reason and resign.

664
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,920
I'm sorry, Master. I won't do it again.

665
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,800
Please help me, my lady.

666
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,520
My lord,

667
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,080
if Liu leaves,

668
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,960
Granny may be upset.

669
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,880
Why not let her stay,

670
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,080
serve Granny more loyally,

671
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,800
and make amends?

672
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,280
- Thank you, sir.
- Not me.

673
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,120
If you want to thank someone,

674
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,040
thank my wife, the mistress
of the Family Shen.

675
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,680
I've been foolish and offensive.

676
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,520
It's generous for you to forgive me.

677
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,320
I will improve

678
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,960
and serve faithfully,

679
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,800
never speaking out of turn again.

680
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,520
That's okay. Go.

681
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,920
Brother.

682
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
You finally admit I'm your wife?

683
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,520
Make up for the one you gave away.

684
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,320
Don't overthink it.

685
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,240
Don't think too much. Don't.

686
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,120
Who's that?

687
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,400
A new ministry officer.

688
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,760
He's solved several big cases.

689
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,520
He is a sharp young man,
highly regarded by the lord.

690
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,640
Skilled and talented.

691
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,000
Is he married yet?

692
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,960
Master Qiao,

693
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,880
every Dragon Boat Festival,

694
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,640
we place zongzi outside to honor the gods.

695
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,240
It always draws a crowd.

696
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,480
Red date, pine nut, chestnut.

697
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,800
Walnut, ginger, persimmon, ginkgo.

698
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,400
Round, pointed, pagoda-shaped,
nine-layered.

699
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,160
Name it, she makes it.

700
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,160
Of all our sisters,

701
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,520
only Qiongnu can do such work.

702
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,440
No one else can compare.

703
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,200
And this, five-colored rice cakes.

704
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,120
If you don't try one, how do you know?

705
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,760
If you don't try one,

706
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,920
how do you know?

707
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,480
Take it slow.

708
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,800
Have some tea.

709
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,160
Don't choke.

710
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,280
My lord,

711
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,440
I'm here to report a case.

712
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,880
I bumped into Master Qiao

713
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,800
and asked him over.

714
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,040
It didn't delay the matter.

715
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,240
Don't be upset, brother.

716
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,080
How's the case going?

717
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,240
Sir, Deng and Ji
had a betrothal agreement.

718
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,080
The Ji was wealthy but fell into poverty.

719
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,640
Three years ago,

720
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,320
the Deng's tried to annul the marriage.

721
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,000
The Ji's sued and took it to Kaifeng.

722
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,840
The court ruled against the Deng's.

723
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,240
They were ordered to marry as planned.

724
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,200
They lived harmoniously afterward.

725
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,520
But last month,

726
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,880
Madam Ji died suddenly during childbirth.

727
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,640
After the funeral,
the Deng's buried her quickly.

728
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,000
The Ji's, living far away,

729
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,080
arrived too late.

730
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,800
She was already buried.

731
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,200
She had a maid with her named Ah Tao.

732
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,400
She claimed that Deng killed her mistress.

733
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,040
The hasty burial was to cover it up.

734
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,480
The case caused quite a stir.

735
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,960
So many are talking about it.

736
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,920
But there's been no resolution.

737
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,640
Then, open the coffin for inspection.

738
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,800
Sir, exhuming a body is a grave matter.

739
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,840
If we find nothing,

740
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,440
the Deng's might retaliate,

741
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,760
harming your reputation.

742
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,400
The living can tell a hundred lies.

743
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,360
But the dead can only tell the truth.

744
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,440
If the Deng's protest,

745
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,080
I'll take full responsibility.

746
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,160
Just go.

747
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,360
Understood.

748
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,000

Master Qiao.

750
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,320
Why do you run faster when I call you?

751
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,080
I'm not done talking.

752
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,600
Isn't he acting strange?

753
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,760
Are you done?

754
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,000
Then go back.

755
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,840
Just go back.
