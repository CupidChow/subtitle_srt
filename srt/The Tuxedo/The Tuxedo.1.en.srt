Nothing, Bro!?

25
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,160

Aor, I have class at 11.00.

32
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,160

Oab!

Call him to cancel,

44
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,960
This is not 100% pure cotton!

45
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,040
High price, low quality, totally cheating!

46
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,920
Handle this.

47
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,560

50
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,440
Coming… Uncle

51
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,120
How is it?

52
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,080
Ah! Like your father skill

53
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,320
Never let me down.

54
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,000
Uncle, Try to sit and walk for checking?

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,760
OK

56
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,280
A bit tight around here?

57
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,840
Gosh!

58
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,560
You know it?

59
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,200
Actually, it is not too tight.

60
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,840
Still ok

61
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,360
Uncle, are you in a hurry to use the suit?

62
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,760
If not, I will fix it.

63
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,160
OK,

64
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,080
Thank you so much.

65
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,880
You are so kind, will have lots of customers

66
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,040
Not that much.

67
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,840
Many engaging customers,

68
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,120
But Oun is so demanding,

69
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,080
Even choosing customers

70
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,760
Ahh, So I should be proud, Oun chose me.

71
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,720
You get profit?

72
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,240
Actually…

73
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,520
Making suit

74
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,680
It is not just about money or profit.

75
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,880
But it concerned about mind.

76
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,840
Hey, I-Oab!

77
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,800
Nearly 11.00 am, Don’t go for class??

78
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,160
OH,

79
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,440
So may I be excused?

80
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,840
Good day.

81
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,720
Like brothers

82
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,600
How about the little one, not coming back?

83
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,880
I guess next week.

84
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,680
Ok, then I have to go.

85
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,400
Hey! Tee

86
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,800
Where are you going?

87
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,640
Hey!

88
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,520
Leave me alone

89
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,360
Catch him!

90
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,480
Stay still

91
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,520

92
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,360

94
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,400

95
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,080
Somebody, Help

96
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,600
HEY, What are you doing!

97
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,200
Let him go!

98
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,520
It is not your business

99
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,640
OK

100
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,760
Not my business

101
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,960
Heyy, Bro

102
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,240
Please Help me!

103
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,520
Hey, Let him go

104
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
Catch him!

105
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
HEYY, GO !

106
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,200
My sleeve

107
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,520
Thank you, Bro

108
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,240
Are you ok?

109
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,040
I am Ok

110
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,560
But look at my sleeve

111
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,720
Tomorrow, I have interview

112
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,840
I think I can help you

113
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,080
Haa?

114
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
Try it

115
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,640
OK

116
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Oh Ho!

117
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,080
Lucky you!

118
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,040
It fits you perfectly

119
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,120
No need to adjust

120
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,400
Thank you so much again Saving my brother

121
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,560
Otherwise, he will end up in hospital.

122
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
No problem

123
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,960
Anyone in that situation

124
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,400
Will do the same as me.

125
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,800
Button up

126
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,520
If you wear the waistcoat, no need to put the suit’s button on.

127
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,680
Oh I see

128
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,640
So I need to take it out.

129
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,920
OK, thank you a lot.

130
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,080

Looks very handsome

137
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,880
So smart

138
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,760
Already done

139
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,880
Thank you.

140
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,560

141
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,720

It’s OK,

145
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,920
You saved my brother.

146
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,080
I give you for Free.

147
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,480
Is that Ok?

148
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,920

149
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,720
Alright

150
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,000
Better than the old one

151
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,120
So where is the job interview?

152
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,640
Ohh,  hmm…

153
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,960
S P Group Ltd. Clothes Exporter

154
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,240
The owner named Mr. Seksan, isn’t he?

155
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,800
Oh.Yes, correct.

156
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,160
But I applied for Mr. Nawee’s Assistant. His Son actually.

157
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,400
Right!

158
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,520
SO…

159
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,400
May I excuse to leave now.

160
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,080
My friend is waiting.

Thank you so much.

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:09,880
See you.

164
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,800
What is it?

165
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,000
If Mr. Sichol gets the job there

166
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,400
That will be the last suit we gave him.

167
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,040
Mr. Nawee..

168
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,000
The Suit shop sent more collections

169
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,200
No!

170
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,920

174
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,120
No!

175
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,120
This is the best one

176
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,880
From all of these cheap shirts

177
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,600
Very Perfect!

178
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,160
But I don’t like it!

179
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,760
Find me new set.

180
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,640
If I don’t have suit wearing on my father’s birthday party…

181
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,200
You are all…

182
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,080
Dead!

183
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,000
Yes, Sirs

184
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,520

Let him wait.

188
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,320
If he can’t wait, just leave.

189
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,840
But this is the last one

190
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,640
And?

191
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,240
Nothing,

192
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,280
I will tell him

193
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,760

Please have a seat

210
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,280
Be yourself

211
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,760
Like you are at home

212
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,960
Have a glass of water?

213
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,080
Yes Mom

214
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,440
Yes

215
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,440
I got interview Mom

216
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,640

217
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,720
I will get the job, Mom.

218
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,320
Very Big House

219
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
How much does it cost to buy this house?

220
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,700
When will he come?

221
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,520
Face is not balance

222
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,720
Not good physiognomy

223
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,760
And…

224
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,360
Something dies in your mouth?

225
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,160
Hey!

226
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,240
My apologize, Mr. Nawee

227
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,280
Hello, Good Day

228
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,120
My name is Sichol

229
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,760
I am 27 years old.

230
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,600
Graduated Batchelor degree from…

231
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,120
What kind of song you like?

232
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,800
Sing for me.

233
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,320
Singing. For you??

234
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,120
Er…I can not

235
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,680
So what do you do in your free time?

236
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,560
My free time, I love watching movies

237
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,320
And playing football

238
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,520
Ok, then show me football

239
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,400
Here?..

240
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,680
But there is no ball.

241
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,560
Your talent?

242
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:24,840
Any?

243
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,960
My talent?

244
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,080
No talent..

245
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,000
Can you do Three-pointed tongue?

246
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,000
Three -Pointed tongue??

247
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,080
Can not…

248
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,960
Then show me somersault

249
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,040
No I can not..

250
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,560
So…

251
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,120
Go back home.

252
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,000
Excuse me!?

253
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,560
Any problems?

254
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,760
Nothing..

255
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,960
But I have not done anything yet, Mr. Nawee.

256
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,400
I already asked what you can do.

257
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,840
You can’t do anything.

258
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,000
Working here,

259
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,280
You have to try first, even you can’t.

260
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,040
If you are tarry, not immediately action.

261
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,080
Not today

262
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,320
Or tomorrow, I will fire you.

263
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,240
Waste of time.

264
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,040
Thank you for your time, Mr. Nawee

265
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
Hey, Wait.

266
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,240
Come back

267
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,000
Fitting Pattern

268
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,800
Perfect Cutting

269
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,160
Adding shoulder pads, looks like British style

270
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,920
Pleated Pants…

271
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,960
Like Italian Style

272
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,400
Yes..This is what I want!

273
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,480
Where you get this suit?

274
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,000
From my friend’s tailor shop

275
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,720
AOA Tailor

276
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,920
Do you want to be my assistant?

277
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,640
Assistant?

278
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,320
Yes.

279
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,120
Good!

280
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,360
Calling this suit maker for me

281
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,720
Your first job...starting tomorrow!

282
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
Tomorrow?

283
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,760
Next time

284
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,240
Dress up well

285
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,760
Thank you, Mr. Nawee.

286
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,840
YES!

287
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,520
I got a job!

288
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,640
Here, Mr. Nawee

289
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,520
No,

290
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,520
I will not make it,

291
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,760
Sorry for this.

292
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,680
AOW?

293
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,240
Why?

294
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,560
Here is Mr. Nawee, the heir of S P Group

295
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,760
The most important,

296
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,440
You can send him your price

297
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,360
I am sure, he will pay with no condition

298
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,720
No is No

299
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,600
Excuse me..

300
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,600
Why?

301
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,320
Mr. Aioun!

302
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,400
Mr. Aioun

303
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,680
It is not about money

304
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,040
My Brother will not make the suit for everyone,

305
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,880
If you don’t believe me.

306
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,320
Here is the name lists

307
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,520
That my brother made the suits.

308
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,200
OHH

309
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,400
That’s a lot…

310
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,680
From 100 names

311
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,880
May I return to you

312
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,120
Before I feel dazzy

313
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,800
Yes OK

314
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:06,200
Let’s say… He will make the suit only the chosen one.

315
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,560
No bad reputation.

316
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,080
Bad reputation?

317
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,200
Yes

318
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,240
Your Mr. Nawee

319
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,880
Have done anything wrong?

320
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,880
Mr. Nawee?

321
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,040
What has Mr. Nawee done before?

322
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,000
Or..

323
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,080
He is a criminal?

324
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,560
No…Can’t be..

325
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,760
What should I do?

326
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,360
Mr. Nawee.

327
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,400
Here comes the suit maker.

328
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,680
You said…he is your friend?

329
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,560
My father’s friend.

330
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,760
He is very skillful

331
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,720
Can be trusted

332
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,320
Excuse me

333
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,160
Please do the body measurement here.

334
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
17

335
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,520
He is reliable, Mr. Nawee

336
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,440
Arm

337
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,000
Err…

338
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,360
Uncle..

339
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,880
I have some issues.

340
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,960
I have unequal back on both sides

341
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,440
Need to adjust a bit on the shoulders

342
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,640
Ohh… That’s ok.

343
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,320
No need to…I will adjust for you.

344
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,360
Ok, Done.

345
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,160
Haa?

346
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,680
Already done?

347
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,480
Yes, already done.

348
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,640
So…please keep J A A Tailor shop in your mind.

349
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,080
What shop, again?

350
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:33,920
AHH!

351
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,000
Uncle…You must be hurry to get back to the shop, right?

352
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,280
Heard that lots of customers are waiting.

353
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,800
Let’s go…I will drop you.

354
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,640
Let’s go

355
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,640
Hurry up.

356
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,680
He is very professional, lots of customers waiting, Mr. Nawee..

357
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,640
Sichol!

358
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,480
Yess..

359
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,800
Yes..Mr. Nawee

360
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,720
First day of working.

361
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,760
You dare to fool me?

362
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,240
HAA?

363
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,400
See…I don’t dare to fool you.

364
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,240
But the real suit maker…doesn’t want to make the suit for     Mr. Nawee.

365
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,880
He said..Mr. Nawee

366
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,800
Used to do something wrong.

367
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,080
Do what?

368
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,320
Forget it..

369
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,880
No matter how, you must bring him to make me my suit!

370
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,720
Because I must ware the best suit on my father’s birthday.

371
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,800
Off you go.

372
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,240
Yes sirs.

373
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,520
Mr. Aioun!

374
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,880

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,760
Please..

378
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,240
No is No

379
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,880
Please help me

380
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,520
Mr. Aioun…please helpp

381
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,160
Oab

382
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,680
Uncle Chok…take care for me

383
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,760
Mr. Aioun…please

384
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,640
Mr. Aioun

385
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,560
Uncle Chok

386
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,160
Mr. Aioun…Mr. Oab, please help me

387
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,200
Don’t be stubborn

388
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,000
Mr. Aioun

389
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,760
Mr. Aioun!

390
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,000
Mr. Aioun…

391
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,480
Mr. Sichol already left

392
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,800
But tomorrow will come again

393
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,800
Hmm…I want to know

394
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,280
What has Mr. Nawee done to you?

395
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,000
Why you don’t want to make suit for him?

396
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,520
He didn’t do anything wrong.

397
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,720
But it is his father.

398
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,560
7 years ago, Mr. Seksan the owner of A P Group

399
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,480
He is our father’s customer

400
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,560
He copied our signature suit.

401
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:13,000
And re-make to be his own brand …when our father was sick.

402
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,800
How come I never know

403
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,760
You think dad want to tell this story?

404
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,520
If I were not at the shop that day when their lawyer came in

405
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,560
I would never know too

406
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,720
I see

407
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,640
So I never trust anyone

408
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,960
But…perhaps father and son are different.

409
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,800
Don’t know..

410
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,280
Father may send his son to do the same..

411
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,400
Hey Bro...think again.

412
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,680
Please help making the suit for Mr. Nawee

413
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,720
I beg you, please

414
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,400
Mr. Aioun…Please help

415
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,400
Just one time

416
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,080
Mr. Aioun..please

417
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,240
Ahh.. Mr. Aioun, please wait upstairs

418
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,720
I will try to find Mr. Nawee.

419
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,920
OK

420
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,960
Please sit here

421
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,000
I will bring some stuffs

422
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,600
Alright

423
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,080
OK

424
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,680
Excuse me

425
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,880
The one I make appointment?

426
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,480
I will do the body measurement

427
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,560
Yes..Body Massage

428
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,120
But..I will use my own massage oil this time

429
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,040
Last time, massager used some oil

430
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,160
It burned my back

431
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,400
Follow me

432
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,840
Oh…Er..

433
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,720
Why don’t you follow me?

434
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,640
Don’t get it?

435
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,680
Err I won’t…

436
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,840
I want to see your manager

437
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,240
What a poor service!

438
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,880
Where’re you going!

439
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,720
Hey! What are you doing!

440
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,120
Mr. Nawee!!

441
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:22,960
Mr. Nawee!!

442
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,100
Mr.Aioun!!

443
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,240
Sichol!

444
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,680
Mr. Aioun?!

445
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,320
Here, Mr. Aioun…perfectly fits with Mr. Nawee shirt.

446
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,960
Good looking!

447
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,960
Aah.. When will Mr. Nawee come down?

448
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,080
Ohh

449
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,760
Should be in a minute.

450
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,040
Here he comes.

451
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,400
Please..

452
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,400
Let me introduce myself in officially,

453
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,680
My name is Aioun from AOA Tailor shop.

454
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,080
Hm

455
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,520
May you advise in which occasion are you wearing this suit?

456
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,840
My father’s birthday

457
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,160
Here is the fabric samples and the pantone

458
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,080
Please have a look and see which one you like.

459
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,120
Are you the tailor?

460
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,440
Pick something for me!

461
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,400
All of these stuffs…I don’t have time to waste.

462
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,760
Let’s say..

463
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,240
I want the best suit

464
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,240
And the most impressive one

465
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,040
Why are you laughing?

466
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,240
So sorry,

467
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,080
I just feel that… your briefing…

468
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,520
It’s much over your head.

469
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,840
Whether the clothes look good or not depends on the person wearing them.

470
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,880
What is your shop name exactly?

471
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,760
A O A Tailor?

472
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,200
Frankly speaking, you should be glad

473
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,320
Frankly speaking, you should be glad

474
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,840
That I choose your little poor-no name-shop

475
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,960
So do your job…

476
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,640
What is the lecturing for??

477
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,920
What do you say?

478
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,200
Rather get the measurement done.

479
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,280
I am busy.

480
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,400
If you call “little poor-no name-shop”

481
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,200
Then see you next life.

482
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,920
I will never do it for you.

483
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,000
Right judgement on him.

484
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,720
Mr. Aioun

485
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,120
Mr. Aioun

486
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,320
Mr. Aioun

487
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,320
Mr. Aioun

488
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,120
Mr. Nawee

489
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,320
I think

490
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,880
Mr. Nawee should say Sorry to Mr. Aioun

491
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,640
What you said

492
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,960
Is a bit too much.

493
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,320
You need him to make your suit

494
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,280
But calling his shop “Little poor- No Name”

495
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,720
You want me to say “Sorry” to him?

496
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,680
Of cause

497
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,320
If you do not say “Sorry”,

498
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,320
We surely have to find the new tailor shop.

499
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,960
He will never make it for you.

500
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:27,840
Yes, I will get it.

501
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,560
This is what you are hired for.

502
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,920
OH HO..Mr. Nawee..

503
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,200
No way..

504
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,320
Listen carefully.

505
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,120
No Way..

506
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,240
AHH!

507
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,680
Sichol!

508
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,520
Got a job, but have to deal with crazy boss.

509
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,640
If I have no house rent debt,

510
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,520
I’d rather quit!

511
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,200
Here is…Mr. Nawee’s body guard photo?

512
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,040
What if that suit maker doesn’t want to make me the suit,

513
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,680
You just show him someone else photo.

514
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,440
Happy Ending.

515
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:24,800
Orr,

516
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,280
Do you really want to get over him ?!…

517
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,040
I must get the perfect suit on my father’s birthday.

518
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,040
If you miss this time,

519
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,720
Get your ass out of my house

520
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,800
And never come back again.

521
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,720
Mr. Aioun

522
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,160
I’m sorry.

523
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,160
I don’t mean to lie to you.

524
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,960
Really sorry, Mr. Aioun

525
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,160
So sorry!

526
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,400
OK!

527
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,000
Let’s do it!

528
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,920
Where is everyone?

529
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,400
Hey!  You little!

530
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,880
Hey! What are you doing!

531
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,040
You’re thief?

532
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,200
You!

533
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,440
What are you doing?

534
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:49,760
Hey!

535
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,680
Are you a thief?

536
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,320
No, I am not!

537
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:51,840
No,no…

538
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,360
Stop!

539
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,080
No, no

540
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:53,920
This is my home!

541
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,640
What’re you talking about!

542
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,160
This is Mr. Aioun’s home.

543
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:55,880
I will get in.

544
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,600
Why break into?

545
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,560
Why don’t use the door?

546
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,880
Short cut..

547
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,160
You think I’m Stupid?!

548
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:00,560
Hey!

549
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,280
Clearly that you are breaking into.

550
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,040
With my own eyes.

551
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,600
No, it’s not!

552
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,760
This is my home…

553
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,360
Come here!

554
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,040
You’re little thief.

555
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,360
I cannot breathe!

556
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,280
Ouch!

557
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,560
Try to be..

558
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,360
Let me go, let me go!

559
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,040
Looking good.

560
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:11,840
Get down

561
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,040
My back…

562
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,320
Ouch!

563
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:13,720
My back…

564
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,280
Stay still

565
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:14,880
Give me

566
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,640
Let me search.

567
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,520
Your bag…take off your back

568
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:16,880
Stop!

569
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,480
Wait, wait

570
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,440
Fatty Bag

571
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,080
My bag

572
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,160
Stop it, Bro

573
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:20,640
Stop!

574
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,120
Here..

575
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,200
Oh oh..

576
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,880
My shirt…..I took from school.

577
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,400
Go to school…why you take shirts.

578
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,800
Why don’t you go to study?

579
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,280
Haa?

580
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:27,640
Ouch!

581
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,400
Full of shirts..

582
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,280
I stay in the dorm!

583
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,480
Oh oh! Very full!

584
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:31,960
My shirts!

585
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,440
Stop!

586
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,400
Bro, Stop!

587
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,480
My shirts!

588
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:36,680
What are you doing?

589
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:37,800
Have smell

590
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,560
Your smell!

591
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,560
You’re psycho?!

592
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,400
I-Art!

593
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:42,880
Art

594
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:43,840
Mr. Sichol

595
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,520
What’s psycho?

596
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:45,960
P-Oun!

597
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,160
Help me!

598
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,440
He will not help you.

599
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,280
Who is he?

600
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,160
P- Oun

601
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,280
Aioun

602
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,480
My little brother

603
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,800
Help me…P-Oun

604
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,880
Bro..Brother?

605
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,080
Err…You just fall down

606
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,560
I help you collecting your stuffs.

607
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,760
Are you nuts?

608
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,800
What..

609
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,120
My little brother

610
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,200
He is in boarding school

611
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,160
Will return home during semester break.

612
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,400
Oh I see

613
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,400
I’m sorry

614
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,520
I am a good citizen

615
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,120
That’s ok.

616
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,040
But..

617
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,760
Why you don’t look like your brothers?

618
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,040
Err…

619
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,880
It’s..

620
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,040
He is adopted

621
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,840
Actually..

622
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,920
His dad was a friend of my dad

623
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,760
He passed away since Art was child.

624
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,520
My dad adopted him

625
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,360
What a pity.

626
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,120
Go to you room

627
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,760
Oab will bring you to.

628
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,480
That’s ok

629
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,280
I can go by myself.

630
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,080
You room..

631
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,680
Is now a storeroom

632
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,520
This semester, you have to sleep in my room.

633
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,320
Hey!

634
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,880
Bumping…why don’t you hit my face instead!

635
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:43,960
Mr. Sichol

636
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,760
Do you have something to say?

637
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,880
Errr..Ohh!

638
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,240
See…My friend would like to have a suit

639
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,800
This…is the body measurement details

640
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,840
If possible, I rather see him at my shop.

641
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,840
Some details cannot just use imagination.

642
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,640
I’m afraid that …his suit will not…

643
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,720
Perfectly fits….

644
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,720
Oh dear…

645
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,680
Err…

646
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,920
It’s..

647
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:30,960
Heyy.!!

648
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:31,760
What Art!

649
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,440
Hey! What!

650
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:33,600
What!

651
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,120
Look!

652
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:34,760
See!

653
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:35,880
Heyy!!!

654
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,040
Aoww!

655
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,920
Crashing us, don’t you say Sorry??
