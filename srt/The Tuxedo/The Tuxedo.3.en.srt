1
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,080
It’s because of Mr. Aioun… You did this to Mr. Nawee

2
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,920
Mr. Nawee called me in last night.

3
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,360
And then fired me.

4
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,480
Mom!

5
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,680
Mom!

6
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,400
Please don’t leave me

7
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,200
You…

8
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,960
Mom

9
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,360
she is my whole world.

10
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,680
Why do you smile?

11
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
You are very details

12
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,400
Have to be

13
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,720
You want the best suit, don’t you?

14
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,520
Look at the suit.

15
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,480
How is it?

16
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,120
Like it?

17
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,880
It’s ok

18
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,440
This is the best suit that I ever have.

19
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,960
Sure...

20
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,960
I made it.

21
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,240
If that’s so,

22
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,600
I must give him reward.

23
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,920
What are you doing?

24
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,200
Mr. Nawee!

25
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,160
Ouch!

26
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,520
Aow!

27
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,520
Why you sit on the floor?

28
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,120
I-Sichol!

29
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,960
Why don’t you knock!

30
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,320
Err…Sorry

31
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,040
Just…I just want to say

32
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,920
My mom is sick, she is in a countryside.

33
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,760
Nobody takes care of her.

34
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,040
My brother will return in 2 days.

35
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,640
So, I would like to take a leave tomorrow.

36
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,320
Alright, just go.

37
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,960
Do whatever.

38
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,520
Please assign someone taking care of you works.

39
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,640
Are you alright?

40
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,480
Mr. Nawee!

41
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,160
Ouch!

42
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,440
What again!

43
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,560
Nothing… I just wanna tell that

44
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,160
Today you look very handsome.

45
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,280
Surly shining brightly into your father’s eyes.

46
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,920
I go now.

47
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,640
Good day Mr. Nawee

48
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,640
Bye bye, Mr. Aioun

49
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,880
Very handsome

50
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,320
Ouch!

51
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,760
You!

52
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,440
What are you playing?

53
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,400
The suit will be wrinkled.

54
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,520
Then let Sichol takes care of it.

55
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,320
Tomorrow?

56
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,160
Wait a minute…

57
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,680
Sichol is off tomorrow!

58
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,640
Tomorrow…

59
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,880
I have no assistant.

60
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,080
You look…so good in the tuxedo.

61
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,440
Actually, I just want to show it to my special one.

62
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,000
That special one....is me?

63
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,360
Good day, Daddy

64
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,680
Nice Suit!

65
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,800
Thank you.

66
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,080
Who is this guy?

67
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,040
Err…This is…

68
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,080
I am Mr. Nawee’s assistant, sirs.

69
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,480
That’s right.

70
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,200
Good day

71
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,480
Aunty Porncheewa and Thawin are already inside.

72
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,480
Please go inside.

73
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,880
Ok everyone.

74
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,480
Let’s start.

75
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,080
That looks nice

76
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,320
But we already had some.

77
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,280
Would you try?

78
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:19,840
Hmm..

79
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,000
That’s alright.

80
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,520
So, let’s try the dessert.

81
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,320
It’s not necessary.

82
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,720
Otherwise

83
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,560
please try the cake.

84
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,960
I know that you love chocolate cake.

85
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,880
So my chef did his best.

86
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,160
He does like it.

87
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,080
But sweets are not good for dad’s health.

88
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,920
It’s unhealthy.

89
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,200
But this is no sugar added cake.

90
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,680
I said No!

91
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,920
Thanks

92
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,760
But I’d rather not having it.

93
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,560
I am full.

94
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,000
You have something to say?

95
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,360
It’s…

96
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,000
Have we done yet?

97
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
Thawin, my dear..

98
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,520
Nawee…

99
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,200
Please continue.

100
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,480
It’s about our project.

101
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,560
Good news for today.

102
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,680
Our oversea production lines,

103
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,400
three of them already confirmed.

104
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,880
But I will update more details to you tomorrow.

105
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,680
Actually, you can update here.

106
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,920
So that Thawin can listen.

107
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,480
Ohh..dear…

108
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,920
Haven’t you told him yet?

109
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,080
Here it is…

110
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,680
Porncheewa.

111
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,240
It’s not your job.

112
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,840
The reason …

113
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,280
I came here today,

114
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,000
just because I want to tell you…

115
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,360
Soon enough, I will transfer your Production Chief
Executive position …

116
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,320
To Thawin,

117
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,080
Who is my only legitimate child.

118
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
But don’t be afraid.

119
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,440
I will give you this house with 50MB cash.

120
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,640
To thank you for taking care of this company for three years.

121
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,920
From now on we have nothing to deal with each other.

122
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,600
What do you mean, dad?

123
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,840
…I don’t understand.

124
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,440
Let’s say..

125
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,080
Dad

126
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,800
will transfer your position to me

127
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,760
And then you will be free

128
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,320
You can do whatever you want.

129
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,000
Oops!

130
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,840
Nawee

131
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,000
Nawee

132
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,600
Mr. Nawee

133
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,960
I-Nawee

134
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,880
Mr. Nawee

135
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,160
Mr. Seksan

136
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,040
Wait at the car.

137
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,760
Mr. Nawee loves you so much.

138
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,480
Please don’t do this to him.

139
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,960
This is my family,

140
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,240
It’s not your business.

141
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,640
You are good at hurting people’s feeling.

142
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,840
You will feel sorry for what you’ve done today.

143
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,760
From Mr. Anan,

144
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,920
my father.

145
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,280
What have I done wrong? Aioun

146
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,360
You did nothing wrong.

147
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,120
Nothing wrong…, Nawee..

148
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,200
Everything will be alright.

149
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,280
Listen to me,

150
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,280
If he doesn’t give you a value,

151
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,800
so you don’t care about him.

152
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,360
You are much better.

153
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,680
Everything will be ok.

154
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,520
Why it has to be like this?

155
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,400
Why it turns out like this? Aioun

156
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,920
I will be your warmth.

157
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,480
You still have me, Nawee.

158
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,160
How are you?

159
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,960
I’m ok.

160
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,560
Live like a living dead,

161
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,240
it doesn’t make anything better.

162
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,520
You have to show people that you are the real one.

163
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
What should I do?

164
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,800
Let’s start from…

165
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,000
There…

166
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,600
Just try to go out…

167
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,760
Then anything is possible.

168
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:33,800
Remember

169
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,040
if you want to go outside,

170
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,320
I will be with you.

171
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,480
Hello, Oab..What’s up?

172
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,840
Hmm…Ok

173
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,760
Hey

174
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,640
please do not bring your friends as last time.

175
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,680
My birthday,

176
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,480
not yours.

177
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:20,840
Hmm…

178
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,560
I’ll be back soon.

179
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,640
What is it?

180
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,440
Ahh…

181
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,800
Oab asked me about my birthday guest.

182
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,160
You can join,

183
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,240
if you want.

184
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,040
Thanks for your invitation.

185
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,080
But I think I can’t go.

186
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,880
It’s ok…

187
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,760
up to you.

188
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,440
I’d better leave.

189
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,800
Just try to go out…

190
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,760
Then anything is possible.

191
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,360
If you want to go out

192
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,520
I will be with you.

193
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,040
Hello, Sichol.

194
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,240
Come to see me today.

195
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,440
I need your help.

196
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,000
Oh…It looks so pretty.

197
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,000
Sichol

198
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,440
Yes?

199
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,400
Can you take this to Mr. Aioun?

200
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,720
Yes sir

201
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,160
Aoh…Sir

202
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:51,960
Yes sir

203
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,840
Wait!

204
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,280
I’ll go with you.

205
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,080
Huu?

206
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,480
Mr. Nawee!

207
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,640
Mr. Nawee!

208
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,240
Are you ok?

209
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:07,840
Please clam down

210
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,760
Take deep breathe

211
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,600
Please clam down

212
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,280
Take deep breathe

213
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,600
Again…

214
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,080
And again…

215
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,240
Get in

216
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:15,480
Get in

217
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,280
Are you alright?

218
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,600
Stand back!

219
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,320
Stand back!

220
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,240
Stand back!

221
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,160
I don’t even come close…

222
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:20,920
Aah…Is that so?

223
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,080
Take deep breathe

224
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,360
Are you ok?

225
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,120
I am blowing.

226
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,080
Stay awake

227
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,880
Just stay awake

228
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,600
Take deep breathe

229
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,520
Mr.Nawee

230
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,920
What’s happening here?

231
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,720
Ahh..

232
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,600
So you are Aioun’s customer

233
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,680
I should have known you,

234
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,640
if you were his schoolmate.

235
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,600
What is your relationship with him?

236
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,960
She is his girlfriend, Mr. Nawee.

237
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,960
Here comes one more delicious menu.

238
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,040
Aunty Lek…

239
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,240
could you please change the menu?

240
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,160
Aioun doesn’t like it.

241
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,640
Why doesn’t he?

242
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,360
Ohh…

243
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,520
he doesn’t like garlic.

244
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,440
It has a strong smell.

245
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,480
But the taste is so good!

246
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,360
I don’t think so…

247
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,680
It’s his birthday.

248
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,360
Don’t make him feel uncomfortable.

249
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,600
Better try something new….

250
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,120
on your birthday.

251
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,680
Am I right? Aioun

252
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,600
Hmm

253
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,120
I don’t think so…Aioun

254
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,320
Err….

255
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,840
That’s alright.

256
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,840
I will …try

257
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,040
Let me taste it.

258
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,600
Actually…

259
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,600
it’s not that bad.

260
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,480
Here it is

261
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,240
This is your favorite pie apple.

262
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,320
I did my best!

263
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:29,960
That’s ok,

264
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,080
I will do it myself.

265
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,000
Aunty Lek did it…must be so delicious.

266
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,840
Has Noo-Chanjao graduated?

267
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,320
Yes, I have.

268
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,280
And I already got a job here,

269
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,960
Permanently move to Thailand.

270
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,560
Ohh…That’s nice

271
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,960
Mr. Aioun will have a life-time partner here.

272
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,880
Do you have a marriage plan?

273
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,560
I asked him…but he never say anything.

274
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,840
You guys have seen each other for many years since school time

275
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Should you have some plan?

276
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,160
Oh..

277
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,840
It’s up to Aioun,

278
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
if he’s ready.

279
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,800
I just recall that I have an appointment.

280
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,360
May I be excused.

281
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,120
Mr. Nawee!

282
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,160
I need some more measurements for your suit.

283
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,640
Please…follow me upstairs.

284
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,960
What suit are you talking about?

285
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,240
I don’t mean to hide you.

286
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,920
Chanjao and I

287
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,640
are not seeing each other like before.

288
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,120
You..

289
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,760
We are not in a relationship.

290
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,400
How come you’re hiding something?

291
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,600
So that you know…

292
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,400
How I feel about you.

293
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,120
I’m not sure…

294
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,360
how you feel.

295
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,480
But I

296
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,080
already fall for you.

297
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,920
Stay with me tonight.

298
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,520
How about that girl?

299
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,400
Is she your girlfriend?

300
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,120
Don’t make it complicated, Aioun.

301
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,960
To know

302
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,440
how you feel to me.

303
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,120
That’s enough.

304
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,680
Is that my present?

305
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,000
That’s pretty.

306
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,800
You made it?

307
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,440
Why it has to be a bird?

308
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,560
It means You.

309
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,600
I can go out because of you.

310
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,960
Now, it doesn’t matter.

311
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,920
Oun..Why don’t you go down?

312
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,800
I feel dizzy.

313
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,840
Are you alright?

314
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:26,920
How about…

315
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,440
Aunty Lek and Uncle Chok? Have they gone back?

316
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,560
Hmm

317
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,000
Oab and Art went to bed.

318
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,840
So..I will leave too.

319
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,040
Ohh…Hmm

320
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,680
All of stuffs downstairs…just leave them.

321
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,320
I will take care of it.

322
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,400
Hmm

323
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,160
Do you want to say something?

324
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,040
See…

325
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,920
My dad wants us to choose the engagement ring.

326
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,760
Engagement ring?

327
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,280
He wants us to get engaged.

328
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,200
Sine we’ve seen each other for years.

329
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,200
And...

330
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,280
he already made an appointment. I don’t know what to do.

331
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,240
I don’t want to forces you.

332
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,560
I know you’re not ready.

333
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,520
We cannot keep continue this unclear relationship…

334
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,760
I am not ok.

335
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,720
Engagement and Marriage is a serious matter,

336
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,760
I think I am not ready

337
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,680
When will you be ready?

338
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,240
I don’t wanna be a stupid girl, who always run after a guy.

339
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,120
We are grown up.

340
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,440
If we want to commit together…

341
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,760
Engagement is not a big deal, isn’t it?

342
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,240
You are not ready…

343
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,680
Or…you don’t love me anymore?

344
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,720
Can we talk about this later?

345
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,560
I feel very headache now.

346
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,600
Fine…Take a medicine and get some rest.

347
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,720
[sorry for last night]
[please don’t keep quiet…makes me worried]

348
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,200
How long have you been arrived?

349
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,120
Just arrived

350
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,280
Is there a reason for today schedule?

351
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,280
It’s about your tailor shop, currently it’s going so well.

352
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,200
Have you ever thought about expanding?

353
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,880
Like exporting or even expanding new branches.

354
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,200
I will ask my friend in England to take care of it.

355
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,240
Chanjao…If you have something to say, just say it.

356
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,200
My dad would like us to choose the engagement ring.

357
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,120
Are you free today?

358
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,800
It’s already appointed?

359
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,280
Can I say No?

360
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,160
If you don’t want to get engaged,

361
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,200
Just talk to me frankly.

362
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,320
So that I don’t have to wait anymore.

363
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,760
If you want me to go…so I will go.

364
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,680
Yes, Mr. Sichol.

365
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,040
I don’t know what to do, who to discuss with.

366
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,120
Mr. Nawee stays only in his room.

367
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,240
Don’t touch the food.

368
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,040
Don’t care about his works.

369
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,560
I really don’t know what to do.

370
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,440
Do you want me to see him?

371
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,120
Mr. Aioun!

372
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,240
Need to hang up now!

373
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,680
He doesn’t like garlic

374
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
It has a strong smell.

375
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,880
But the taste is so good!

376
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,880
Do you have a marriage plan?

377
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,480
It’s up to Aioun,

378
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,720
if he’s ready.

379
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,560
Mr. Nawee

380
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,560
Mr. Nawee

381
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,040
Mr. Nawee, please open the door.

382
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,880
Mr. Nawee

383
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,640
Mr. Nawee

384
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,080
Mr. Nawee

385
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,240
Are you crazy?

386
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,120
It’s so late, why you are here?

387
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,480
So that you know

388
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,640
ว่าผมรู้สึกยังไงกับคุณ

389
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,240
I’m not sure

390
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,600
how you feel.

391
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:32,400
But I already fall for you.

392
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,960
No more hurting yourself, Nawee

393
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,360
Sichol told me you never leave your room.

394
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,160
Let’s go outside.

395
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,120
Mr. Aioun.

396
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,000
Where are you taking me?

397
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,840
To see the world…

398
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,880
You always stay inside the house.

399
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,000
I don’t want to…take me home…

400
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,680
Hey…We’ve gone so far…too far to go back.

401
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,400
I will bring you a good coffee.

402
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,640
Be right back.

403
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,400
I’ll be back in a minute.

404
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,480
Listen to me!

405
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,400
We both may not see each other anymore.

406
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,840
I will soon move to England.
