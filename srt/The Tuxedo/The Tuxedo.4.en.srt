1
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,400
Ahh..

2
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,280
So you are Aioun’s customer

3
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,360
I should have known you,

4
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,320
if you were his schoolmate.

5
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,160
I’m not sure…

6
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,400
how you feel.

7
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,520
But I

8
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,120
already fall for you.

9
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,920
Mr. Aioun.

10
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,800
Where are you taking me?

11
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,640
To see the world…

12
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,680
You always stay inside the house.

13
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,800
I don’t want to…take me home…

14
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,480
Hey…We’ve gone so far…too far to go back.

15
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,960
Youu..

16
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,680
What’s your name?

17
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,320
Have you got a girlfriend?

18
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,960
Wanna take a photo?

19
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,600
What’s your name?

20
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,240
You’re a bastard…a bastard…

21
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,160
You’re a bastard…a bastard…

22
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,920
No!

23
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,240
a bastard… a bastard…

24
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,000
I am not!

25
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,800
Ahh!!

26
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,480
Mr. Nawee!

27
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,880
Yes, you are a bastard…

28
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,920
No, I am not…

29
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,360
No, I am not a bastard…

30
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,400
You are a bastard…

31
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,040
a bastard… a bastard…

32
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,160
Mr. Nawee

33
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,000
Mr. Nawee

34
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,760
Mr. Nawee

35
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,640
Mr. Nawee

36
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,440
Mr. Nawee

37
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,560
Mr. Nawee

38
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,560
Mr. Nawee

39
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:48,840
Mr. Nawee

40
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,080
Nawee, my son!

41
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,720
Mom!

42
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,960
My son!

43
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,240
Nawee…

44
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,360
Mom

45
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,640
Mr. Nawee

46
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,760
Mr. Nawee

47
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,440
Can you hear me now?

48
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,000
Feel better?

49
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,960
Hmm

50
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,800
What are you doing?

51
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,760
See…your heart stops shaking.

52
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,480
You can go outside from now on.

53
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,160
If you are scared, just tell me.

54
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,280
I’ll be with you.

55
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
I’ll always be your warmth.

56
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,600
I promise.

57
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,320
Yes, I have graduated…Already
got a job here and permanently move to Thailand.

58
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,000
Ohh…

59
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,480
That’s nice. Mr. Aioun will have a life-time partner here.

60
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,360
I have to tell you that from now on…

61
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,520
We should never meet again.

62
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,120
Because of Chanjao?

63
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,440
We are not…

64
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,040
Being nice to me…

65
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,840
Will I be appreciated?

66
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,520
Totally I’m not.

67
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,680
You must think that I am so pathetic…

68
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,280
Why are you saying that?

69
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,280
I never think in that way.

70
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,600
You are so attractive to others,

71
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,680
You are so attractive to others,

72
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,720
then you try to be nice to dominate a loser like me?

73
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,280
Mr. Na…

74
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:32,880
Mr. Nawee!

75
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,640
Are you alright?

76
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,680
Go back to your place.

77
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,120
You are nothing else...just a suit maker.

78
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,080
You really think I feel something?

79
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,800
What are you doing?

80
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,680
I am sketching the suit pattern!

81
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,320
What?

82
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,760
Sketching the suit pattern!

83
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,200
Can’t hear it, say it out loud.

84
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,640
Are you trying to be cheeky?

85
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,840
I’m sketching the suit pattern.

86
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,520
Sketching the suit pattern?!

87
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,240
What suit?

88
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,400
Our family business!

89
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,560
Can you make it?

90
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,960
Of cause, Bro!

91
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,640
Really??

92
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,520
Thought you can only cut the glass

93
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,760
Yeah, cut it to pour down your head!!

94
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,880
Feew..

95
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,080
Hey!

96
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,880
A turtle?

97
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,800
Here..

98
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,760
Considering as my apology.

99
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,080
Hoo…

100
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,440
I will take a good care of him.

101
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,200
Actually, you are a nice guy, aren’t you?

102
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,880
I already named him.

103
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,720
What’s his name?

104
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,560
Kun-Chieng

105
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,480
Haa?

106
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,080
It’s not cool.

107
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,000
If you don’t like it, give him back.

108
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,560
Heyy

109
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,200
Oh Ho……

110
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,040
I’m kidding…Just kidding…

111
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,280
Hi

112
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,120
Got an engagement ring yesterday? How is it?

113
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,040
Chanjao and I…we broke up.

114
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,000
Ha?

115
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:02,920
Are you ok?

116
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,200
Emm

117
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,880
Do you want me to see him?

118
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,360
Mr. Aioun!

119
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,200
Need to hang up now!

120
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,200
What’s wrong?

121
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,880
Something’s wrong?

122
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,360
I…

123
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,640
I am not ready to be engaged.

124
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,160
I am so sorry.

125
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,320
You mean just now or forever?

126
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,120
You should have told me earlier.

127
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,680
So, we both would not waste our time.

128
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,960
Finally, we are back to be friend.

129
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,720
I really feel that our feelings have changed.

130
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,600
But I don’t expect …

131
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,400
it will turn out like this.

132
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,560
Thanks for telling me the truth.

133
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,320
Nickname789designer@hotmail.com

134
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,960
This is Nick’s email, the tailor shop’s owner in England. He’s interested in your shop.

135
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,280
You can send him email.

136
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,080
Thanks for your help, Chanjao.

137
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,840
You really put a lot of your effort.

138
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,120
Mr. Aioun.

139
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,120
As you know,

140
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,480
Staff members keep resigning.

141
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,360
He also reduced my salary.

142
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,560
I guess he wants me to resign too.

143
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,400
Then, I have to find part-time jobs.

144
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,440
At first, I would also like to quit,

145
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,680
But when I looked at him……

146
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,520
As a matter of fact,

147
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,040
I really don’t want to get involved.

148
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,840
But I was thinking that…

149
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,200
It would be better if during the time of Mr. Nawee

150
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,160
has got the gentle and kind person as Mr. Aioun

151
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,640
taking care of him and stay beside him.

152
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,360
I guess Mr. Nawee will have a better life.

153
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,840
I…

154
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,880
I’d like to see him.

155
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,680
But I think he doesn’t want to see me anymore.

156
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I’m not so sure…

157
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,240
I don’t know if we will see each other again.

158
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,800
Soon, I will move to England.

159
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,920
Ha?

160
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,920
England?

161
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,960
Correct.

162
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,800
Mr. Nawee!

163
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Mr. Nawee!

164
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,960
Emergency!

165
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:06,920
I-Sichol!

166
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,920
Have told you million times to knock the door!

167
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,720
Ohh Mr. Nawee

168
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
Ohh Mr. Nawee

169
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
Stop mumbling.

170
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,000
Mr. Aioun will move to England soon.

171
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,280
Ha?

172
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,960
Moreover,

173
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,520
He already broke up with Ms. Chanjao.

174
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,560
