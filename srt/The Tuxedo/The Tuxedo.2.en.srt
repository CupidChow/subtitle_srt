1
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,560
What is it?

2
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,600
If Mr. Sichol gets the job there

3
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,840
That will be the last suit we gave him.

4
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,880
Mr. Nawee!!

5
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,400
Mr. Aioun?!

6
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,760
If possible, I rather see him at my shop.

7
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,520
Err…

8
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,760
It’s..

9
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,720
My friend…

10
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,120
He’s….

11
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,560
Mr. Oab,.

12
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,440
Could you please grab tissue for me?

13
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,600
Behind your back..

14
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,560
Coming..

15
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,880
Coming…Coming..

16
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,280
It’s…

17
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,320
My friend..

18
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,920
My friend…he is really sick,

19
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,360
Seriously

20
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,160
He is a bedridden patient for years.

21
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:16,960
See..

22
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,280
He told me..

23
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,760
He would like to wear a smart suit

24
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,320
Before the doctor..

25
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,400
Before the doctor will remove the respirator

26
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,760
Please help me

27
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,240
Please

28
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,080
Mr. Aioun..Please…

29
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,280
Ok, I will do.

30
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,240
Really?

31
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,120
Yes,

32
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,120
I’m so happy

33
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,200
Very happy

34
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,680
Tissue… Where is tissue?

35
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,680
Please wait a minute.

36
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,320
I will bring catalogue.

37
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,680
Ok,

38
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,400
My friend will be very happy too

39
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,760
Mr. Sichol

40
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,160
Crying...

41
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,920
But no tears?

42
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,000
It’s inside.

43
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,640
In here.

44
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,800
You don’t see it?

45
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,560
But you can feel it.

46
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,040
How it’s really pain

47
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,640
Your friend is so lucky

48
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,920
My brother will make the suit for him, no need to come to the shop.

49
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,680
Really?

50
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,280
Yes

51
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,600
Thank you so much

52
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,600
Here

53
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,280
Let him select the fabric,

54
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,000
Collar, and button styles.

55
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,480
I already sorted everything out.

56
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,800
Can open this box

57
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,400
This box?

58
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,080
yes

59
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,080
Thank you

60
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,480
Ohh..

61
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:37,960
If my friend knows

62
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,160
He will be very happy

63
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,000
Ohh..I better leave now.

64
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,840
Thank you so much

65
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,200
Good bye

66
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,200
What?

67
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,440
Hmm

68
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
Got it

69
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,880
Cleaning first

70
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,400
Ready?

71
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,160
1…2….Tada!

72
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,120
Like it?

73
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,680
You think I’m a fool? If you want to have the suit,
please go to somewhere else.

74
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,720
Like it?

75
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Why is nothing?

76
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,360
We have to use his sympathy

77
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,760
What are you looking at?

78
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,000
Come closer

79
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,560
Hurry up

80
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,800
Ok

81
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,760
closer

82
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,280
What?

83
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,880
P-Oun!!

84
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,680
I-Art!

85
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,360
Hey! What!

86
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,520
What!

87
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,040
Look!

88
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,680
Take a Look!

89
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,640
เห้ย!!!

90
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,280
Mr. Sichol!

91
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,400
What happen, Mr. Sichol?

92
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,040
It’s because of Mr. Aioun… You did this to Mr. Nawee

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,880
Mr. Nawee called me in last night.

94
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,320
And then fired me.

95
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,840
At the beginning…I felt very relieved.
To get away from that guy

96
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,360
But when I returned home, found creditors attacked me

97
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,200
I have no money to give them

98
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,800
So..

99
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,240
Let me help you?

100
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,200
How much you owe them..I will help

101
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,040
That’ ok

102
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,760
You help me many times

103
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,720
Or…

104
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,560
You can work in my shop.

105
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,840
The Salary may not high as much as Mr. Nawee..

106
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,200
But can help you pay your debt.

107
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,000
The point is about salary.

108
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,920
The thing is..

109
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,400
I worked with Mr. Nawee for a while.

110
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,800
Before he fired me, he told me that.

111
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,400
He would pay me

112
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,480
What if..

113
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,520
You agree to make him the suit.

114
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,640
What’s wrong with him?

115
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,840
Mr. Aioun

116
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,920
Say something

117
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,160
I- Oab

118
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,120
Any free time tomorrow?

119
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,680
Already fully booked

120
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,480
But we are free after we close.

121
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,600
Then…

122
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,200
Tomorrow at 21.00pm, bring him here?

123
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,840
This is the last time that I will help you.

124
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,360
Oh, really?

125
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,440
Thank you so much

126
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,720
Yes

127
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,200
Ohh..

128
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,400
Do you have 200 Baht?

129
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,760
What?

130
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,040
I will..

131
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,320
Buy some medicine at the shop.

132
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,080
You can use ours

133
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,600
Oh. You have one?

134
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,400
I-Art

135
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,000
OK

136
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,000
May I have painkillers 2 units

137
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,840
OK

138
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,560
I will get it.

139
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,800
Thank you

140
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,640
Hello Mr. Nawee

141
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,640
Everything is done

142
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,280
Ok..Yes..Ok

143
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,760
Yes

144
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,160
Sichol

145
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,800
What happened to your face?

146
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,120
Come closer

147
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,640
What?

148
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,000
Aorr..

149
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,640
Had a fight with some kids

150
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,120
Look like shit

151
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,520
Tomorrow at 20.30pm, please prepare the car.

152
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,080
Mr. Nawee will be at the shop.

153
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,000
What?

154
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,600
Are you kidding?

155
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,480
Aow!

156
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,280
Seriously

157
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,120
Ohh…Sichol

158
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,440
You’ve been working here for a month,

159
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,440
Don’t you notice that Mr. Nawee never leave home?

160
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,720
Ohh …

161
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,320
That’s true

162
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,880
Why I never leave home?

163
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,480
I heard that he got some mental illness.

164
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,040
Like…He doesn’t want to see many people.

165
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,280
Since he was young..

166
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,800
He would go out with his mother.

167
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,080
But since his mother passed away, he decided

168
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,080
Not to go out again.

169
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,120
I guess, you must bring the suit maker to the house again.

170
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,200
Aoy..

171
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,480
What again?

172
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,160
I’m in a trouble again..

173
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,360
Get away from me!

174
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,600
Aow!

175
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,520
Can’t you say Sorry?

176
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,520
You little …

177
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,440
I-Oab

178
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,600
What are you arguing?

179
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,880
It’s the turtle.

180
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:29,760
Turtle?

181
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,160
Emm

182
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,240
Last semester, I-Art bought a turtle.

183
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,720
His name is Sho-Gun

184
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,640
I saw him always play with the turtle, no studying.

185
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,280
So I hided it, …after that it disappeared.

186
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
You lost it?

187
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,080
I forgot that a turtle has legs

188
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,160
I guess it already found the sea.

189
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,880
Funny..

190
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,720
P-Oun

191
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,400
Anybody will be mad at this.

192
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,240
Say sorry to him?

193
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,880
Try to talk with

194
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,720
Try to play with

195
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,800
But he doesn’t care

196
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,640
Don’t know what to do

197
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,640
Grow up!

198
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,040
Don’t play around

199
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,560
Talk to him..

200
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,040
[How do I bring him out?]

201
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,120
What are you looking at?

202
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,640
Aor…Nothing

203
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,480
Just today, you look very handsome.

204
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,600
Why Aioun has not arrived yet?

205
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,040
Well, It’s still not the appointed time yet.

206
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,720
[then anesthetize.]

207
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,280
Want to have some glass of water?

208
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,800
Will cool down..

209
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,000
No..leave it..

210
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,600
[anesthetize plan is not working]

211
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,560
[if that…it’s my turn…]

212
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,800
Mr. Nawee

213
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,960
Aliens!

214
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,720
Where?

215
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,800
Mr. Nawee

216
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,920
Mr. Nawee

217
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,120
ได้ผล

218
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,240
Lying down. Not possible to do measurement

219
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,200
Have to stand up

220
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,800
He cannot stand up

221
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,680
Not a small guy

222
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,480
I think..

223
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,240
Help carrying him?

224
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,560
Ok

225
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,200
Let’s go

226
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,080
Ok, Mr. Sichol

227
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,600
I-Sichol!

228
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,360
Ouch!

229
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,760
Heyy!!

230
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,240

It’s me

234
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,400
Hey!

235
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,440
Mr. Nawee

236
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,320
What’s happening?

237
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,120
Clam down

238

Measuring your size, it will finish soon,

239
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,080
Mr. Aioun, …go on

240
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,400

Chest is 38

245
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,800
Go on, Mr. Aioun go on

246
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
This is not my home!

247

Why you play with him, Cherrene?

273

He is a bastard

274

Yes, you are.

Do it, P-Oun

287
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,960
Take it easy..

You..

302
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Nightmare?

303
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,120
Nothing

304
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,360
Just feel not comfortable.

305
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,160
Where am I?

306
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,240
In my room

307
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,280
How are you?

308
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,480
Still feel dizzy?

309
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,520
Better now.

310
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,360
Sichol told me that you have trouble when leaving the house.

311
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,240
We never though that thing will go this far.

312
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,000
Sorry.

313
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,960
Ok, you will go back now?

314
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,680
I will call Sichol.

315
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,480
Wait.

316
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,200
Let me rest here for a moment.

317
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,320
Your button is detached

318
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,920
I guess it fell off while you were shocking at downstairs.

319
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,520
Let me fix it.

320
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,720
No need to..

321
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,840
I will buy the new one.

322
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,960
Why have to buy the new one?

323
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,600
Just a small torn

324
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,240
I can fix it easily.

325
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,880
You are like that since your childhood?

326
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,160
Hmm

327
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
I don’t like seeing many people.

328
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,680
I feel I cannot breathe.

329
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,600
Have you seen the doctor?

330
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,120
Excuse me…I am over 20 years old..

331
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:55,200
I’ve been thru all of sciences…but I am not cured

332
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,160
Anyway,..

333
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:07,440
Better to be alone…feel happy

334
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,320
To be alone.

335
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,080
Don’t you feel lonely?

336
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,840
Of cause

337
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,280
But what should I do?

338
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,360
How can I force someone to stay with me?

339
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,920
I see..

340
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,520
So when your father comes to see you,

341
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,760
You want to do it your best, right?

342
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,760
You know me well.

343
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,360
Mind reader?

344
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,720
Am I right?

345
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,680
Ouch!

346
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,320
Hey!

347
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,960
I will clean the wound

348
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,600
Art, try to do it first.

349
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,800
Call me if you need some help.

350
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,640
OK

351
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,480
Arrr!

352
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,320
I am late..

353
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,120
Will I be there in time?

354
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,120
I-Oab, will you go with me?

355
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,200
I will meet supplier.

356
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,680
Ok..Let’s go.

357
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,640
Ouch!

358
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,480
Are you teasing me?

359
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,960
Nope..I just grab my pencil.

360
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,640
I’m in a hurry..

361
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,800
I-Art, please take care of the shop.

362
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,600
Ok, no prob

363
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,880
You think that other people’s matters are so trifle.

364
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,400
Then It’s my turn.

365
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,760
What should I do..

366
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,440
Just…leave it here a minute..

367
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,000
I will follow you

368
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,920
I will grab it

369
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,560
Ok go go

370
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,600
Aow, Keep going

371
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,000
Heyy

372
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,720
Where is everyone

373
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,560
Hey!

374
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,320
Keep doing!

375
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,320
Ok Great!

376
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,680
Ok Nice

377
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,160
Get it all…last one

378
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,680
Hurry up, Hurry up

379
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,360
Move move

380
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,120
Ohh

381
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,680
Hit the tower

382
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,000
The Inner

383
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,920
Aunty Lek

384
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,320
Yes?

385
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,680
Where have the clothes gone?

386
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,200
Ohh..These clothes?

387
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Mr. Aioun told me that he will not use them anymore,

388
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,120
So I threw them all.

389
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,880
Haa?

390
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,160
Where is it?

391
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,480
Oab said it should be in this room.

392
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,760
I-Art!

393
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,520
Have you seen Oab’s leather notebook?

394
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,480
Err…

395
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,640
Err…

396
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,640
Good day Mr. Sichol

397
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,000
Can you make me appointment with Mr. Nawee?

398
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
I lost his body measurement note

399
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,640
Ok

400
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,960
I will see him tonight

401
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,800
Thank you.

402
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,520
See?

403
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,840
P-Oun has to take responsibility.

404
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,320
You knew. What’s inside that notebook.

405
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,120
Sorry

406
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,480
Play fool..

407
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,360
You even took my turtle and hid it

408
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,400
I don’t mean to..

409
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,640
So me too

410
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,880
If you said you don’t mean to, so why you do this?

411
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,840
I did as what you did.

412
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,280
Heyy..

413
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,120
Why’re you guys having argument?

414
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,000
I-Oab

415
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,480
He said Sorry

416
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,520
Just forgive him.

417
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,080
Ohh..P-Oun

418
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,120
When I took and hid his turtle,

419
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,880
He’s mad at me for years

420
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,360
You want me to forgive him now?

421
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,720
Too easy?

422
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,400
Years ago,

423
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,240
You don’t really feel sorry for this.

424
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,400
Always play around

425
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,000
You don’t really care what I’ve lost.

426
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,040
You know…Sho-Kun..

427
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,240
May be just a turtle for you..

428
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,080
But it is my whole world..

429
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,880
I-Art..

430
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,160
I’m really Sorry

431
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,080
I haven’t though about it before.

432
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,320
So…I am sorry for what I did too.

433
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,600
About the notebook

434
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,080
Herr..

435
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,760
Let’s say

436
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,960
We are good now.

437
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,520
Hmm.

438
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,160
From now on…you must tell me everything.

439
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,000
I am a bad mind reader

440
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,480
Deal

441
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,280
Come here

442
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:16,960
Hey! What?

443
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,360
Come here

444
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,920
Are you mad?

445
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,640
Why you hug me?

446
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,600
We are good now!

447
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,400
No more hug..

448
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,400
Ok,..

449
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,760
I will assign Sichol to recheck whether if there is any issues.

450
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,880
I will feedback you.

451
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:53,920
Good,

452
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,120
manage it.

453
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,480
Ok

454
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,120
Dad..

455
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,480
Er…

456
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,800
I feel very thankful

457
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,160
That you let me arrange the party here this year.

458
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,960
The party always held at the master house,

459
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,040
Changing the place is not the big deal.

460
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,240
I am so glad having meal with you again

461
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,360
Since mom passed away,

462
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,880
We barely talk.

463
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,120
Apart from work.

464
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,000
My work is my life.

465
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,000
What can I do?

466
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,040
Take care of yourself.

467
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:39,760
Good day, sirs

468
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:00,960
Hey!

469
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:01,720
You!

470
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,360
You!

471
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,720
What’s wrong?

472
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,440
Nothing

473
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,680
I’m just happy

474
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,400
Haa?

475
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,400
Do you know?

476
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,520
This is my first time,

477
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:30,120
My dad said something else apart of working stuff to me.

478
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,320
And how you lost?

479
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,040
How you lost my measurement details?

480
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,480
My brothers were teasing each other.

481
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,040
It’s good to have siblings like yours.

482
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,520
Feel not lonely

483
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,160
It depends…

484
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,560
Sometimes, I just want to stay silence.

485
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,840
Then you wanna join me?

486
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,720
Silence as what you want.

487
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,840
Crazy…

488
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,240
How long have you been alone?

489
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,040
Can’t remember.

490
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,720
Since my mom passed away?

491
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,320
My mom

492
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,480
she didn’t want me to go out.

493
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,360
She’s afraid people will gossip about me.

494
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,160
My mom always went out with me.

495
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:52,960
Mom

496
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,360
she is my whole world.

497
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,240
But sometimes

498
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,520
I just wonder

499
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,760
About the perfect family.

500
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,880
What do they do in a day?

501
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,400
Do they talk to themselves?

502
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,160
When they get troubles

503
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,080
Do they wonder?

504
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,080
What they did,

505
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,680
It’s right

506
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,280
or wrong.

507
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,160
You don’t even think about trying to get out?

508
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,440
Let’s do cold turkey?

509
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,960
You need to overcome your fears.

510
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,520
What for?

511
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,680
If anything happens

512
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,440
who will take care of me?

513
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,160
Me..

514
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,560
When you feel like want to go out,

515
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,560
Just tell me.

516
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,320
Just tell me the truth.

517
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,640
You didn’t lose my body measurement.

518
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,400
But you just want to see me…

519
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,040
Am I right?

520
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,720
What if…

521
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,440
That’s right?

522
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:09,920
What are you doing?

523
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:24,720
Everything is done

524
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,200
Then…I’m leaving.

525
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,640
What?

526
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:04,800
Thank you.

527
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,400
What’s wrong with you?

528
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:40,880
Hmm?

529
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,080
Smiling like you are in love.

530
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,360
What? …I always smile.

531
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,680
So how was Mr. Nawee yesterday?

532
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,920
He’s fine

533
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:53,880
Why?

534
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:55,680
Nothing.

535
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,840
Just saw news on the internet, they shared
Mr. Seksan’s son photo, the billionaire.

536
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,160
I though it was Mr. Nawee.

537
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:07,840
But…

538
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,400
look!

539
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,000
P-Oun

540
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:26,640
Haa?

541
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,640
Are you Ok?

542
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,640
Nothing.

543
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,000
Get back to work.

544
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,280
So weird.

545
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,480
Better try something new…on your birthday.

546
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,360
Am I right? Aioun.
