1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Xiangshan He Shun Film Co., Ltd.

2
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,520
They were so eager to kill him.

3
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,280
His Highness doesn't want to admit that Zhao killed your mother.

4
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,760
If there is no evidence,

5
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,560
my father only wants to see what he sees.

6
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,960
I'm just curious.

7
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,600
Lin Feng,

8
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,200
found out where we hid the witness?

9
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,720
You suspect me?

10
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,360
If only I never suspected you.

11
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,560
I thought about it for a whole day.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,560
I think Ah Lian is suspicious.

13
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,920
You may have a point.

14
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,400
Lin Che.

15
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,160
When did you know I wasn’t Cho Bo-ah?

16
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,280
When I first met you,

17
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,160
when I first met you.

18
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,600
Rumor has it that Zhao Bao'er is extremely ugly.

19
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,360
I married a beauty.

20
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,520
At first,

21
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,960
I thought the Zhao family set you up

22
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,800
to keep you by my side.

23
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,759
Later I found

24
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,520
you didn't really help them.

25
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,000
You have your own opinion.

26
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,560
Since you found out,

27
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,400
why didn't you expose me?

28
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,960
Why should I expose you?

29
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,800
Since you're not helping Lin Feng,

30
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,560
maybe it's good for me.

31
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,120
Is it really good for you?

32
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,720
Why are you being so weird today?

33
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,720
If you're not only good for me,

34
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,160
you’re also the one I’ve tried my best to protect.

35
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,160
Lin Che.

36
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,720
What do you like about me?

37
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,960
Since when did you like me?

38
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,360
You're a very independent woman.

39
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,200
Actually,

40
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,800
I've tested you many times.

41
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,160
You played a game with me and Lin Feng.

42
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,720
You're unwilling to be a puppet.

43
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,560
You still have a heart.

44
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,960
There are so many poor people in this world.

45
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,560
Can you help them all?

46
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,320
Are you not helping because you can't?

47
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,079
Besides, you're different from them.

48
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,560
You are the son of His Highness.

49
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,399
You have the responsibility to protect one side.

50
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,560
You should be the people's food and clothing.

51
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,800
to protect them.

52
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,760
But now?

53
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,880
you ate the grain they took for the royal family

54
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,080
and hurt your people.

55
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,920
and care about the people.

56
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,560
Most importantly,

57
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,680
you make my heart flutter.

58
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,280
I miss you.

59
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,159
You know what?

60
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,159
I didn't see you today.

61
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
I missed you.

62
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,400
But I don't want you to like me.

63
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,480
I don't deserve your love.

64
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,280
It’s not up to you to decide.

65
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,360
Lin Che.

66
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,320
What would you want to do

67
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,880
what would you want to do?

68
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,280
I will try my best to save you.

69
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,080
What if

70
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,560
you have only one day left,

71
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,480
What do you want to do?

72
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,440
At midnight,

73
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,440
safe and sound.

74
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,200
Rou.

75
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,320
Rou.

76
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,720
Little fool.

77
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,640
Little fool.

78
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,280
Here.

79
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,280
Rou.

80
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,680
Your eyes haven't recovered yet.

81
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,480
Don't worry about me.

82
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,240
Rou, don't be afraid.

83
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,800
I promised you.

84
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,240
to watch the stars with you every night.

85
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,800
I brought the stars here.

86
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,920
You can't see it.

87
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,200
How can you be sure there are stars?

88
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,200
Rou, don't cry.

89
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,920
There is dew in the morning.

90
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,120
Tomorrow is sunny.

91
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,840
I can see the stars tonight.

92
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,080
Rou.

93
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,800
Don't be sad.

94
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,640
I'll always be here with you.

95
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,880
Let's watch the sunrise tomorrow, okay?

96
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,440
Fool.

97
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,240
Take me away.

98
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,320
Let's get out of here, okay?

99
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,480
Rou, I can't leave now.

100
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,640
My parents are locked up by Lin Feng.

101
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
My sister is in trouble too.

102
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,800
I... I have to help them.

103
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,480
How could this happen?

104
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,800
Do you want me to beg her?

105
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,880
Mother has always loved me.

106
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,200
She will let them out.

107
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,880
Rou, this is not as simple as you think.

108
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,080
Stay here.

109
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,320
Take care of yourself.

110
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Wait for me to pick you up.

111
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,720
Let's go together, okay?

112
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,080
You will come back to pick me up.

113
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,440
right?

114
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,480
I will.

115
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,840
Let me dance for you.

116
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,720
Sure.

117
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,040
But I can't see it.

118
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,680
It’s OK. I have an idea.

119
