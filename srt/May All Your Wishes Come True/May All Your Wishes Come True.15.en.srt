1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Xiangshan He Shun Film Co., Ltd. Ltd. Ltd. Ltd. Ltd.

2
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,640
I called you many times.

3
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,040
Why didn't you see me?

4
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,920
I’ve been studying food since I was a kid.

5
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,960
If the Queen doesn’t listen to me,

6
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,120
the taste of the food will be half gone.

7
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,880
I can't manipulate the queen.

8
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,800
But I’m stubborn

9
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,240
I’m stubborn.

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,400
To avoid conflicts with the Queen,

11
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,520
I chose to avoid it.

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,960
You mean I'm petty?

13
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,240
My love.

14
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,640
I wouldn't dare even if you gave me 10,000 guts.

15
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,080
I...

16
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,080
I...

17
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,160
I heard that

18
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,880
the queen always eats to meet friends.

19
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,759
That's why she recommended food through the spoon.

20
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,320
Why are you so serious?

21
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,759
I'm just kidding.

22
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,520
Just kidding.

23
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,480
You scared me.

24
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,800
Your Highness, you are so naughty.

25
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
Let me tell you.

26
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,480
I

27
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,920
respect you.

28
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,800
Do you know?

29
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,720
In my heart,

30
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,320
in my heart.

31
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,440
Really.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,079
Tell me what your special rules are.

33
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,280
So mysterious.

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,360
I'll forgive you for everything.

35
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,800
I promise I won't let you down.

36
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,320
Good wine.

37
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,000
If one bottle goes down,

38
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,440
it'll be great.

39
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,240
Your Highness.

40
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,079
Special rules.

41
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,080
Who?

42
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,360
It's me.

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,720
Let me remind you.

44
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,520
You can't drink water

45
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,800
you can't drink water.

46
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:17,880
Okay.

47
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,880
My daughter can be saved.

48
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,680
You may leave.

49
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:20,760
Yes.

50
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,800
It's time to drink.

51
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,800
Good wine.

52
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,120
Come and have a look.

53
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,520
Let's go over there.

54
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,000
The rice grains of South Bridge are thick.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,880
It tastes sweet.

56
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,640
Boss.

57
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,040
How much is the rice?

58
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,280
490 yuan.

59
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,600
So expensive.

60
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,960
Is this expensive?

61
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,240
Go out and ask around.

62
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,400
The next stall costs 500 yuan.

63
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,480
Tao Yi Rice Shop costs 600 yuan.

64
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,760
Let's go.

65
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,520
Where did the boss come from?

66
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,960
Yo.

67
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,920
Your rice looks good.

68
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,760
Where did you get it?

69
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,680
Nanqiao.

70
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,520
The rice grains of Nanqiao are thick.

71
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,880
It tastes sweet.

72
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,360
Judging from the streets,

73
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,159
there must be a lot of people in Nanqiao.

74
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,880
There are dozens of cars in a row.

75
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,560
All those who are capable have sent their representatives.

76
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,280
We'll pay you triple.

77
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,680
Who doesn't?

78
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,880
How is it? Almost all the surrounding areas are here.

79
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,520
Even rice shops from Nanqiao are so far.

80
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,000
The price is indeed a bit high.

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,960
How dare you say that?

82
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,520
It's all your doing.

83
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,960
I'll see what you'll do.

84
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,600
What are you praying for?

85
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,920
What's so ugly?

86
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,720
God of Bandits.

87
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,760
This is the God of Bandits.

88
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,960
This must be Taotie.

89
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,840
Sir,

90
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,880
You look decent,

91
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,960
but you have no manners.

92
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,920
You judge people by their looks.

93
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,320
Linglong eyes are light and yellow whiskers.

94
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,960
When I open my eyes,

95
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,920
God is terrifying.

96
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,200
Although it's hard to tell a man from a woman,

97
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,120
he saved the refugees and the people in the city.

98
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,600
Although he was extremely ugly,

99
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,880
he has a heart for the world.

100
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,680
Yes.

101
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,560
You know what?

102
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
your mouth

103
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,360
is quite similar.

104
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,080
There are no gods in the world.

105
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,520
We have to rely on ourselves.

106
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,640
The God of Bandits is not everything.

107
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,600
Nonsense.

108
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,760
Yes, you are speaking ill of the God of Bandits.

109
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,760
Release the food!

110
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,040
Release the food!

111
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,240
God is watching!

112
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,000
Brothers, food is distributed in West Street.

113
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,040
Let's go.

114
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,720
Let's go and see the God of Bandits.

115
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,320
What God of Bandits?

116
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,040
Release the food!

117
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,000
Release the food!

118
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,280
Don't worry, everyone has food.

119
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,600
Open the granary.

120
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,640
Boss, Lin Che.

121
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,360
Be kind.

122
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,760
There are food suppliers there.

123
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,640
Everyone has food.

124
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,520
Don't rush.

125
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,360
Give out the food!

126
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,880
It's really high.

127
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,159
The rice price in Yongzhou is rising.

128
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,120
the grains nearby will hear

129
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,680
They came all the way to sell grain

130
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,720
to make a fortune.

131
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,400
But when they arrive,

132
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,680
when they arrive.

133
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,040
to catch them off guard.

134
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,560
If they continue to sell at a high price,

135
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,920
no one will buy it.

136
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,440
If you go out of town,

137
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,640
it'll cost a lot.

138
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,080
In this way,

139
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,760
these foreign grains have no choice

140
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,720
to sell food at a low price.

141
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
You're smart.

142
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,360
Of course. I made my wish.

143
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,440
When everything comes to my eyes,

144
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,080
when they come to my eyes.

145
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,440
As long as it's related to money,

146
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,680
I know it better than anyone.

147
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,560
Since you calculated it so clearly,

148
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,840
tell me

149
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,160
what the local grains should do.

150
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,560
Outer grains are too expensive

151
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,840
due to the high grounding cost.

152
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,800
will naturally lower the grain price.

153
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,560
But it's not a long-term solution to open the granary.

154
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,080
When the warehouse is out,

155
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,040
these local officials can still

156
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,840
they can still sell grain at a high price.

157
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,080
Yau Kee Rice Shop has belonged to the Zhao family for more than ten years.

158
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,400
Tang's Rice Shop has been there for six years.

159
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,040
Princess Zhao, you can't just let her die.

160
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,760
Yes. In order to cover the rice,

161
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,720
our rice shops

162
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,080
for six months.

163
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,720
With Tao Yi Rice Shop now,

164
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,760
we don't even have any trousers left.

165
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,120
When the summer food arrives,

166
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,760
the new rice becomes rice.

167
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,240
Chen Mi becomes moldy rice.

168
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,440
It's not a big deal.

169
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,840
The crucial moment is,

170
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,800
we can't panic first.

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,600
I have bought all the grain merchants around Yongzhou.

172
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,280
The food from Tao Yi Rice Shop won’t last long.

173
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,880
Lin Che was prepared.

174
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,680
