00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Xiangshan He Shun Film Co., Ltd.

2
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,800
Sweet contact.

3
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,720
What are you thinking?

4
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,640
What kind of tea did you drink?

5
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,760
Let me try it.

6
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,200
Okay.

7
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,960
Good tea.

8
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,840
What kind of cake did you eat?

9
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,640
Let me try

10
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,520
It's so sweet.

11
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,640
Is it good?

12
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,440
Yes.

13
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,280
Can I feed you if it's delicious?

14
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,120
Sure.

15
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,000
If it's so delicious, eat it all.

16
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,000
Honey, I got scalded.

17
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:51,920
You...

18
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,120
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
What are you looking at?

20
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,720
What is this?

21
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,360
Why did I fall asleep?

22
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,400
No.

23
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,840
Again.

24
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,000
The water level is not right.

25
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,840
The water

26
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,120
If it doesn't pass the tea powder,

27
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,040
Wow

28
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,200
Your eyelashes are so long.

29
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,840
Can you close your eyes and let me see?

30
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
I closed my eyes.

31
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,520
Catch.

32
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,800
Whether he blushes or not,

33
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,920
just say it.

34
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,440
Why are you blushing?

35
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,200
Honey.

36
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,240
Look.

37
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,840
What does this mean?

38
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,840
A gentleman has a heart.

39
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
As the old saying goes,

40
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,720
Your eyelashes are so long.

41
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,000
Let me tell you.

42
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,400
You have the right eye this time.

43
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,400
My eyelashes are prickly.

44
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,800
All women who have seen my eyes

45
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,840
Do you know what they like about me the most?

46
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,240
They like me when I look back and smile.

47
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,200
I'm in a good mood today.

48
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,760
Let me show you.

49
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,920
Then tell me if he's blushing or not.

50
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,240
Why are you blushing?

51
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,600
Hey.

52
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,280
Why are you blushing?

53
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,480
In your eyes...

54
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,920
It's okay. I have my unique skill.

55
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,000
I call it the close eyebrows.

56
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,840
Honey, I feel some pain here.

57
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,120
Can you help me

58
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,600
if it was bitten by a mosquito?

59
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,360
Where?

60
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,200
Is it?

61
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,480
At this time

62
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,600
The distance between eyes

63
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,720
We can basically feel each other's breath.

64
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,440
At this moment,

65
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,320
Don't wait.

66
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,400
Take him down now.

67
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,200
At this time, he will definitely

68
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,000
kiss you.

69
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,440
No.

70
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,240
Cheers.

71
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,159
What are you doing? This is a drill.

72
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,240
Do you know that?

73
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,640
Lin Che has a different brain.

74
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,200
I have to teach him based on his talent.

75
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,720
All right, you can leave now.

76
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,240
Honey, it's late.

77
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,440
I'm going to the side room to rest.

78
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,840
Honey.

79
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,039
It hurts here.

80
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,520
Honey, take a look.

81
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,320
Is it bitten by a mosquito?

82
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,640
It's been three autumn.

83
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,040
Where did the mosquitoes come from?

84
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,720
But there's a drum pack here.

85
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,280
It hurts and itches.

86
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,760
Honey, help me check what's going on.

87
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,200
Really?

88
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,600
Do you like me?

89
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,080
No.

90
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,240
There's nothing here without you.

91
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,560
You said you were bitten by a mosquito.

92
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,160
He's obviously playing tricks.

93
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,440
to get closer to you.

94
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,040
But I remember you said last time

95
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,840
that those who are better than me are like stars in the sky.

96
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,840
Ants on the ground.

97
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,440
Now you're saying this again.

98
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,680
I knew it wouldn't work.

99
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,000
Then I'll have to use my ultimate skill.

100
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,680
I'm popular.

101
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,160
Honey, I know what you like.

102
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,280
I saw it that day.
