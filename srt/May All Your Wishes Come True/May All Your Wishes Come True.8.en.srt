1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Xiangshan He Shun Film Co., Ltd.

2
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,800
Be careful.

3
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,120
That's too much.

4
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,520
Are you okay?

5
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,160
Let's go.

6
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:03,760
Go!

7
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,240
Go!

8
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,440
Run!

9
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,560
Move!

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,800
Let's go.

11
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,800
Brother and sister-in-law, this way.

12
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,360
Stop!

13
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,200
Stop!

14
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,000
Stop!

15
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,039
Wait.

16
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,400
Come here.

17
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,360
You two hide here.

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,560
I'll lure them here.

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,360
No.

20
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:53,520
I'm here.

21
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,520
Come after me!

22
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,240
Get down!

23
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,040
After them!

24
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,040
Hurry!

25
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,040
Rou's men are very murderous.

26
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,120
Stay here.

27
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,000
Don't go anywhere.

28
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,640
Be careful.

29
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,680
Ah.

30
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,160
Hey.

31
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,960
Oh.

32
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,200
Come here

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,960
He ran away

34
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,160
Ouch

35
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,760
Are you tired? Put it down.

36
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,640
Put them down.

37
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,840
Brothers,

38
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,800
our acting today is really good.

39
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,160
I've achieved my goal.

40
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,360
We got the money.

41
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,840
We can go home now.

42
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,160
Where is he?

43
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,200
Who is it?

44
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,160
The show is over.

45
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,000
Stop acting.

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,840
Let's go.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,800
Almost.

48
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,280
Where are Lin Che and others?

49
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,840
What do you mean?

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,920
What's going on?

51
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,400
Oh

52
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,200
Oh, my brain.

53
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,240
You didn't give me enough money, right?

54
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,200
Don't worry. I'll pay you when I get back.

55
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,240
As long as you let me sleep tonight.

56
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,200
Who sent you here?

57
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,200
Lin Che is so skilled.

58
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,440
What are you doing?

59
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,040
Fool.

60
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,000
You're awake.

61
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,040
Don't worry. You're safe now.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,840
Thank you.

63
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,159
Recently, I've been preparing spices to paint.

64
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,840
Which one smells better?

65
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,680
Which one is sweeter?

66
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,320
No.

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,840
Smell it.

68
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,720
I don't smell it.

69
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,880
You smell good.

70
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,040
You little fool.

71
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,400
Don't hesitate.

72
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,560
Why would I save you if I wanted to hurt you?

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,840
Smell it.

74
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,840
Ouch

75
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,360
I forgot I can't smell these two spices together.

76
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,760
You witch!

77
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:56,880
Rou.

78
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,720
Brother.

79
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,920
Are you okay?

80
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
Are you hurt?

81
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
Why are you here?

82
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,840
I'm fine. He saved me.

83
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,520
Thank you for saving me.

84
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,040
May I know your name?

85
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,000
Where do you live?

86
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,040
I can ask my family to prepare a gift.

87
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,080
I...

88
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,600
I came from the north to escape from famine.

89
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,440
My family was poor when I was young.

90
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,440
I learned some martial arts.

91
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,080
to make a living on the street.

92
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,240
That won't do.

93
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,000
Give him a job.

94
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,400
As the saying goes, I have to repay you for saving my life.

95
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,680
If you don't mind,

96
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,440
I can arrange a job for you.

97
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,520
Your salary may not be high,

98
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,440
but it's more decent than the acrobatics you mentioned.

99
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,240
I'll accept it then.

100
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,000
I didn't mean to offend you.

101
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,680
I will take responsibility.

102
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,000
No.

103
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,520
You don't have to.

104
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,920
Rou is my sister.

105
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,840
Maybe you didn't mean to offend her when you saved her.

106
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,440
Let's forget about it.

107
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,520
You don't care about me.

108
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,720
Don't worry about it

109
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,480
It's against the rules.

110
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,800
You don't have to care.

111
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
But I have my own rules.

112
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,920
I can't break it.

113
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,000
I just want to be your guard

114
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,240
and keep you safe.

115
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,680
Please don't laugh.

116
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,320
I'm doing something serious

117
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,320
serious thing.

118
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,360
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,120
Rou.

120
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,679
What do you think?

121
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,720
Well,

122
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Let's put it beside him and see how he does.

123
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,120
Let's see if you can

124
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,040
to protect my sister.

125
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,840
Thank you, sir.

126
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,600
Isn't this the mark we just made?

127
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,960
We're back.

128
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,120
Wen Youcai, what's wrong with you?

129
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,520
Didn't you say you know this place very well?

130
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,960
with your eyes closed?

131
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,880
No.

132
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,800
It's too dark.

133
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,120
It's not my fault.

134
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,560
No.

135
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,080
We can't go any further.

136
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,640
The forest ahead is getting tighter.

137
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,960
and we don't know the terrain.

138
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,440
It'll be more troublesome if we run into a beast.

139
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,680
Let's stay here tonight

140
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,400
and go back to the mansion tomorrow morning.

141
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,600
Alright.

142
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,440
Let’s see what else you can do.

143
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,440
Lin Che is in love.

144
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:00,760
