1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Xiangshan He Shun Film Co., Ltd.

2
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,200
You can't eat hot tofu if you're anxious.

3
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,440
You almost made your father angry today.

4
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,120
In my eyes,

5
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,800
Lin Che can do anything.

6
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,840
He always talks about Lin Che.

7
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,720
Even praising me and bringing Lin Che along.

8
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,920
Get up.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,240
You have a bigger plan.

10
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,360
Mother has her own plan.

11
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,240
Lin Che is kind to his servants.

12
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,360
But if he had an affair with the servants,

13
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,240
this matter will change.

14
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,120
Mother.

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,560
Did you poison Lin Che?

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,200
I’ve spread the rumor about Lin Che’s inappropriate behavior.

17
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,400
Now,

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,800
waiting for Jing to enter Lin Che’s room.

19
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,440
Jing.

20
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:46,680
Young Master.

21
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,960
The ginseng soup Her Highness made for you.

22
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,840
Why do you look so pale?

23
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,960
Okay, I'll take it in.

24
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,759
Yes.

25
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,960
No one can go near the inner room tonight.

26
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,200
Do you know why?

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,120
Why?

28
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,120
I saw Jing go in.

29
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,640
Didn't you say you have something important to do tonight?

30
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,720
No one can disturb him.

31
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,000
What is it?

32
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,120
I think

33
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,360
it's a romantic story.

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,720
You keep shouting

35
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,840
you're afraid I'll harass you.

36
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,320
Who's taking advantage of you now?

37
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,240
I even reflected on myself because I misunderstood you.

38
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,840
I even blamed myself.

39
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,640
The person who drugged her

40
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,520
just want me and Bo-ah to be a real couple?

41
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,800
Not exactly.

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,079
You...

43
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,520
Bao.

44
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,720
Sorry.

45
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,560
Leave now.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,680
If I offend you later,

47
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,640
Slap me.

48
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,440
What are you doing?

49
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,400
You asked for it.

50
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,640
I haven't done anything yet.

51
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,040
I must agree to this request.

52
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,120
to help you sober up.

53
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,120
You...

54
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,800
It's my fault.

55
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,960
A woman like you

56
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,800
doesn't need anyone to protect you.

57
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,320
Right now!

58
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,720
Get out of my room.

59
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,560
Fine.

60
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,640
Don't think that

61
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,480
you can get rid of the suspicion of flirting with me that day.

62
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,400
I know how glib-tongued you are.

63
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,680
I'm glib-tongued.

64
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,480
I...

65
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,320
Jo Bo-ah.

66
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,360
I told you

67
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,560
you're up to no good.

68
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,640
You're not leaving?

69
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,560
I'll leave.

70
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes.

71
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,400
I fell in love with you at first sight.

72
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,200
I can't sleep at night.

73
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,560
Just listen to me.

74
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,040
No.

75
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,680
Stop!

76
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,120
I...

77
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,920
I really...

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,280
Run.

79
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,240
I can't run anymore.

80
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,320
Stop running.

81
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,320
Wait a minute.

82
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,160
Let me think about it.

83
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,120
Let’s hide in Lin Che’s room.

84
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,600
because we don’t want our daughter to be bullied.

85
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,840
I thought about it.

86
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,200
Actually, it's okay

87
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,160
it’s OK.

88
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,520
If our daughter really marries Lin Che,

89
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,600
we will be in-laws.

90
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,840
Our daughter is dead now.

91
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,320
What are you thinking?

92
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,200
Come back!

93
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,640
Are you stupid?

94
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,120
If Lin Che really falls in love with our daughter,

95
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,360
he’ll get the antidote for her.

96
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,440
That's right.

97
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,240
Sister.

98
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,520
Then what should I do?

99
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,760
You...

100
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,160
Go back.

101
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,840
It won't last long.

102
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,760
Sister.

103
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,160
When I get the antidote,

104
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,720
let's go together.

105
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,280
A loving scene.

106
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,320
It's time to play with Master.

107
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,800
You said you love me.

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,840
It's me.

109
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,720
There are countless people who love me.

110
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,720
I want to know your reason.

111
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,920
I like you.

112
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,320
A toad wants to eat swan meat.

113
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,440
You don't know what's good for you.

114
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,600
You're average from your body to appearance.

115
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,040
I hate your personality even more.

116
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,960
People who are prettier than you are like stars in the sky.

117
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,600
There are countless ants

118
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,520
countless.

119
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,760
You...

120
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,680
You didn't see other girls looking at me.

121
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,240
The people in the mansion

122
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,120
or power.

123
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,560
Who would tell you the truth?

124
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,640
They wish that one day

125
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,400
you'd be happy to fall off.

126
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,480
People who praise you don't necessarily treat you sincerely.

127
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,040
They probably want you to be so arrogant

128
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,000
and kill yourself.

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,680
Shut up!

130
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,360
Do I need you to lecture me?

131
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,080
Hurry.

132
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,600
Your Highness, Your Highness, Crown Prince, kneel down.

133
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,280
I won't argue with you about this.

134
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,360
Leave now.

135
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,000
I should have been drugged.

136
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,840
Although we are husband and wife,

137
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,160
we are not a real couple.

138
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,840
I don't want to take advantage of you.

139
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,440
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,840
Your Highness.

141
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,320
Rong Ah Lian, go report to him.

142
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,200
Who?

143
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,560
Honey.

144
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,160
Suzhen.

145
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,160
Greetings, Father, Mother.

146
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,840
This...

147
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,400
It's late.

148
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,560
Why are you all here?

149
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,800
What's the matter?

150
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,360
I don't know who did this.

151
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,080
My wife and I

152
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,440
are greeting Duke Zhou.

153
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
I don't know which unruly servant

154
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,480
locked the door.

155
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,720
I heard some noise outside.

156
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,960
I thought I caught the locked servant.

157
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,440
but it startled my father and mother.

158
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,200
I feel so ashamed.

159
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,840
Che’s marriage is normal.

160
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,240
In that case,

161
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,160
I'm the one who broke the rules.

162
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,560
All right.

163
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,320
Don’t blame yourself.

164
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,840
After all, you’re worried about Che.

165
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,040
Keep investigating.

166
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,800
We must find out the truth.

167
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,040
Yes, Your Highness.

168
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,880
What?

169
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,320
I haven't been in the toilet for days.

170
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,640
Hurry up.

171
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,600
Once it hits the soul,

172
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,000
Refreshing.

173
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,800
Comfortable.

174
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,360
Lin Che doesn’t look that bad.

175
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,320
No.

176
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,760
Am I that charming?

177
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,600
I was drugged.

178
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,560
All you think about is asking me to leave.

179
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,960
What am I thinking?

180
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Isn't that better?

181
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,800
We've settled this.

182
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,920
From now on, we have nothing to do

183
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,960
with him.

184
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,600
He's dressed like this.

185
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,200
Where are you going?

186
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,440
Let's go.

187
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,000
He came out so mysteriously

188
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,960
just to visit the brothel.

189
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,360
Sir.

190
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,880
So this is what you like.

191
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,520
Sir, you tied me tightly.

192
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,280
I like it so much.

193
