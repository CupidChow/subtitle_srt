1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Xiangshan He Shun Film Co., Ltd.

2
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,720
Good rabbit.

3
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,920
Don't move.

4
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,400
Don't move.

5
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,880
Be good.

6
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,440
Don't move.

7
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,720
Don't run!

8
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,240
Rabbit.

9
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,360
Stop!

10
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,280
Why are you laughing?

11
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Come and help.

12
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,880
Oh.

13
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,400
Leave it to me.

14
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,240
Grab it!

15
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,520
Give me a hand.

16
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:51,079
Why didn't you take it out earlier?

17
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,640
You didn't ask me.

18
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,680
I...

19
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,920
Yes, it's not. It's not. It's not. It's not.

20
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,640
The fire wasn't raw,

21
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,240
you're quite skillful.

22
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,400
As Miss Zhao,

23
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,200
you know these.

24
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,320
The north is full of famine.

25
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,840
I learned these from the refugees.

26
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,120
I don't know if I can use them one day.

27
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,240
You're right.

28
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,040
There's a drought in the north.

29
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,240
Why don't we bring our parents-in-law here

30
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,440
and enjoy life together?

31
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,040
No need. My brother is married.

32
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,160
He will take care of my parents.

33
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,280
And my brother's child needs parents to take care of.

34
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,000
Why don't we

35
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,360
in a few days

36
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,720
to visit you.

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,120
My mother said

38
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,079
I wasn't pregnant with the child of the Lin family.

39
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,120
If she doesn't see me,

40
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,600
even if she doesn't see me.

41
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,079
Your mother is right.

42
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,160
It's time to put it on the agenda.

43
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,400
Brother and sister-in-law.

44
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,440
I caught the rabbit.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,920
Try it.

46
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,240
It looks good

47
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,160
It looks a little hot

48
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,840
It smells good.

49
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:38,400
Of course, this method comes from the Beggar Sect.

50
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,280
You might not have tried it.

51
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,720
Who taught you

52
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,000
Who taught you this?

53
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,440
A refugee taught me.

54
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,280
A nickname.

55
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,520
Rabbit.

56
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:54,960
Not bad.

57
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,720
When I was young,

58
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,800
my mother often saved refugees.

59
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,480
Maybe I learned it from the refugees.

60
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,240
I loved it.

61
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,200
Mother often made it for me.

62
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,680
Then Little Madam...

63
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,240
Hush.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,280
It's fine if you're outside.

65
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,800
Don't mention Little Madam Ye in the mansion.

66
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,920
My mother died of illness.

67
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,920
This is a taboo

68
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,720
This is a taboo.

69
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,520
She's not Little Madam.

70
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,200
Open the door!

71
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,880
Open the door.

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,920
Remember,

73
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,080
I only have one wish.

74
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,920
I hope Che can grow up safely.

75
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,680
You must be careful with your words and actions in the mansion.

76
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,840
Don't expose yourself.

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,800
Open the door!

78
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,040
Che, remember what I said.

79
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,520
Mother.

80
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,320
Mother.

81
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:55,880
Che.

82
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,560
Mom.

83
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,920
Che.

84
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,000
Mother.

85
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,520
Come with me.

86
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,160
Okay.

87
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,640
I don't know what happened back then,

88
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,320
but if she had a soul in heaven,

89
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,120
she must be very happy.

90
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,720
You grew up healthy.

91
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,400
I haven't fulfilled

92
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,360
what she wanted.

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,120
But her real wish has come true.

94
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,080
As parents,

95
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,560
what they really think

96
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,480
is not necessarily to let their children become famous.

97
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,680
I just want them to grow up safely

98
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,800
and live a happy life.

99
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,680
Let's not talk about this.

100
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,240
Wait for me.

101
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,200
Look.

102
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,840
Yes.

103
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,840
This is the earth.

104
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,520
This is the sky.

105
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,840
This is a forest.

106
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,720
Then what is this circle?

107
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,440
This is a rotating star.

108
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,040
Rou, you're not serious.

109
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,600
Look at mine.

110
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,200
Wow.

111
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,600
Wow.

112
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,600
Jo Bo-ah.

113
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,400
I made mushroom soup.

114
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,320
You can have the first bowl.

115
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,919
Can you drink this?

116
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,000
Try it.

117
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,480
What should we eat?

118
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,920
How about this cup for Wen Youcai?

119
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,760
Thank him for saving my life today.

120
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,720
This first bowl of Yulu Fairy Wine is for you.

121
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,520
You should drink it.

122
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,400
I'll accept it.

123
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,840
But I want to propose a toast.

124
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,120
As you wish.

125
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,360
What do you think?

126
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,400
Yes.

127
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,000
This is the most delicious soup I've ever had.

128
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,840
The fragrance of grass

129
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,680
the texture of mud.

130
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,520
Oh, the firewood is running out.

131
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,440
I'll go get some firewood

132
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,040
Okay.

133
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,680
Then I...

134
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,200
There's firewood here.

135
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,880
It's okay. I'll get you another bowl.

136
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,480
Here's another one.

137
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,840
The big one should go easy on the small one.

138
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,280
Why don't you drink it softly?

139
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,720
Drink it then.

140
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,240
It's delicious.

141
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,360
I love it forever.

142
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,320
I’ll go find some firewood for Youcai.

143
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,880
Jo Bo-ah.

144
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,240
It’s OK. There’s the biggest one.

145
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,520
How is it?

146
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,000
Delicious.

147
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,720
You risked your life to save me today.

148
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm really touched.

149
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,920
Why?

150
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,280
I found the robbers.

151
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,840
I felt guilty.

152
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,600
Besides, if I don't save you,

153
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,280
I'll be the scapegoat.

154
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,120
Saving a life is better than building a seven-level pagoda.

155
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,120
Don't mention it.

156
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,240
Jo Bo-ah.

157
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,400
Let me ask you a question.

158
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,040
Answer me honestly.

159
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,600
Do you

160
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,160
like me?

161
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,520
Do you like me?

162
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:43,480
Lin Che, Meng En.

163
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:43,840
Xu Zi Yin made a wish.

164
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,440
Wen Youcai, Han Haotian.

165
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:44,720
Lin Rou, Chen Chuqi.

166
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,080
Lin Rou. Chen Chuqi.

167
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,400
Lin Feng Yi, Jin Wangwang.

168
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:45,720
Lin Feng Yi, Jin Wangwang.

169
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,120
Lin Yan and Yang Jun.

170
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,400
Lucky Du, Tan Yinmin.

171
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:46,720
Lucky Du, Tan Yinmin.

172
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,000
Qian Youfu Yi, Guo Chang.

173
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,280
Qian Youfu Yi, Guo Chang.

174
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:47,640
Zhao Mingzhu, Liu Lingling.

175
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,320
Lin Dao Cheng, Feng Wusheng.

176
