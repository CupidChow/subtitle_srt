1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Xiangshan He Shun Film Co., Ltd.

2
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,240
Zhao Bao'er.

3
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,120
Yes?

4
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,360
Let me ask you a question.

5
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,680
Answer me honestly.

6
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,520
Yes.

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,360
Do you

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,040
Do you like me?

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,000
Ah.

10
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,600
Do you like me?

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,600
What is this?

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,520
He's so serious.

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,840
Does he really love me?

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,880
I only cheat money and not love.

15
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,120
Why do you ask?

16
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,200
You don't like me.

17
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,560
Don't change the subject.

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,600
I'm asking you now.

19
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,760
Did you make the soup with it?

20
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,120
Yes.

21
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,039
You've finished it.

22
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,600
Isn't this a green hand?

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,320
Fireflies.

24
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
There are no fireflies.

25
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,240
Oh.

26
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,640
Fireflies.

27
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,160
Catch it.

28
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,120
Hey.

29
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,520
Got it.

30
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,040
So many people.

31
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,079
What's going on?

32
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:34,880
Stop!

33
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,840
Don't touch my sister!

34
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,240
When did you get sick?

35
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,040
Bite me.

36
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,360
What a big braised pork!

37
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,280
Again?

38
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,360
Braised pork.

39
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,880
Ah.

40
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,760
I know Jo Bo-ah.

41
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,240
you've liked me for a long time.

42
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,320
What happened today

43
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,680
what happened today.

44
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,200
But we need a long-term plan.

45
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,240
so that we won't let you down.

46
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,880
The way of Confucius and Mencius.

47
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,160
How did this braised pork study?

48
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,120
Braised pork.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,840
Stop!

50
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,160
Stop!

51
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,160
Braised pork.

52
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,840
I don't understand.

53
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,640
how can a lady like you have so much strength?

54
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,640
I don't understand.

55
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,519
Such a big piece of braised pork.

56
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:18,760
No.

57
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,640
You can talk.

58
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,040
I still can't eat.

59
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,480
You...

60
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,040
You're all hallucinating.

61
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,600
You...

62
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,280
You...

63
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,080
Let go!

64
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,280
What are you doing?

65
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,840
I can't breathe.

66
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,200
I'm drowning.

67
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,680
Drowned?

68
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,280
Something's bothering me.

69
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,840
It's a water ghost.

70
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,040
No.

71
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,840
You mean I'm a water ghost?

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,640
Hey.

73
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,040
Let me give you a hint.

74
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,520
You can breathe.

75
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,720
Brother, you saved a life.

76
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,520
is better than building a seven-level pagoda.

77
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,160
Zhao Bao'er.

78
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,159
I...

79
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,080
artificial respiration.

80
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,640
What?

81
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,040
You were drowned.

82
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,240
There's no water here.

83
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,120
I told you there's no water here.

84
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,680
I fell into your trap again.

85
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,320
Braised pork.

86
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,760
What a big braised pork!

87
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,040
Braised pork, don't run!

88
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,320
Braised pork!

89
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,200
Where are you going?

90
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,240
What are you doing?

91
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,920
Braised pork.

92
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,000
I heard that you fell from the hill.

93
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,000
What's going on?

94
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,440
Who is this young man?

95
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,320
Father.

96
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,400
We were attacked last night.

97
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,760
The robbers are ruthless.

98
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,600
There are many people.

99
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,040
Luckily, this warrior helped us.

100
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,240
Otherwise, we would have died.

101
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,560
The mansion is recruiting guards.

102
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,320
So I recommended him here.

103
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,480
Anyone alive?

104
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,800
They came prepared.

105
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,880
Once they get caught,

106
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,080
he will take poison and commit suicide.

107
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,080
Report what happened last night to the Ministry of Justice.

108
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,600
and ask him to give me an answer in two days.

109
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,560
Yes.

110
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,320
Lu'er.

111
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,520
Take this young man to rest.

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,120
Yes, Your Highness.

113
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,640
There are many refugees recently.

114
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,760
Most of them are desperate.

115
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,040
It's five times more than normal burning and looting.

116
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,520
In my opinion,

117
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,400
don't go out for the time being.

118
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,080
Protect yourself.

119
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,800
The refugees flooded into Yongzhou.

120
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,480
Unfortunately, many officials stocked up goods.

121
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,720
and sold grain at a high price.

122
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,520
and upset His Majesty.

123
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,920
It's not easy

124
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,240
to help His Majesty.

125
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,600
The power involved in this is complicated.

126
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,920
We have to supervise the rice price

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,200
and can't offend anyone.

128
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,600
Wind, Che, Yan'er.

129
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,000
What do you think about this?

130
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,400
Before the poison attacks,

131
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,160
if I can gain your trust,

132
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,120
you may be safe.

133
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,040
Zhu, Bao, Rou.

134
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,560
Go back to your room.

135
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,240
But...

136
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,640
Yes.

137
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,880
You may leave too.

138
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,240
Let's go.

139
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,160
Curiosity kills the cat.

140
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,120
Making public panic in the court

141
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,120
to make everyone

142
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,120
to figure out His Majesty's intention.

143
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,840
Governor Xu will lead the way to lower the rice price

144
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,520
to create a malicious competition.

145
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,200
and put on a show that everyone will scare themselves.

146
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,400
Recently, the Longzhou Competition has been held.

147
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,440
and set up awards for you.

148
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,960
There are many rich businessmen in Yongzhou who like to watch games.

149
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,000
Daxing Civil Engineering

150
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,400
to encourage the rich in the city

151
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,080
build a house

152
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,240
and build a temple.

153
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,400
Rich merchants get cheap manpower.

154
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,440
The refugees solved the survival problem.

155
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,040
but the refugees' famine can be solved.

156
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,680
Where is Che?

157
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,600
Father.

158
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,320
I'm stupid.

159
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,760
I didn’t think of a good prescription.

160
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,640
Che never talks.

161
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,600
He has many ideas.

162
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,280
Father,

163
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,000
You let him go every time.

164
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,440
I have to let him say it today.

165
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,840
Yes, Che.

166
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,160
Just say it once.

167
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,320
Everyone is waiting.

168
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,240
Stop making fun of me.

169
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,040
I'm not good at politics.

170
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,680
All these are curing the symptoms, not the root.

171
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,120
My husband told me

172
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,560
told me a plan.

173
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,760
Please give your husband a rice shop

174
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,040
to solve this problem.

175
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,840
When did I...

176
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,520
If you don't agree,

177
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,600
