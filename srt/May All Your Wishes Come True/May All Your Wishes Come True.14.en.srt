1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Xiangshan He Shun Film Co., Ltd.

2
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,560
Come on.

3
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,960
Kill him!

4
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
Please spare my life.

5
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,800
Don't panic.

6
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,760
You're not Cho Bo-ah.

7
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,600
I'm so happy.

8
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,960
Why are you so happy?

9
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,200
Since you already know,

10
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,800
I don't have to hide it from you.

11
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,160
To me, I'm not Cho Bo-ah.

12
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,000
The real Cho Bo-ah has a lover.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,120
doesn't want to marry you.

14
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,400
but I have to take care of my family's mission.

15
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,560
I just wanted to help her.

16
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,200
to replace her.

17
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,360
Then the cicada removed its shell.

18
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,800
But I didn't expect Lin Feng poisoned me.

19
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,280
by Lin Feng.

20
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,920
You knew I wasn't Jo Bo-ah, right?

21
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,040
But for you,

22
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,800
as long as I'm not a member of the Zhao family,

23
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,960
you will be happy.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,199
and take the opportunity.

25
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,080
Pretend to be deaf and dumb.

26
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,720
You mean I'm using you?

27
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,600
Am I wrong?

28
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,800
You're a villain. You're a villain.

29
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,240
You...

30
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:19,960
make a wish.

31
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,960
Think about it.

32
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,640
Did I tell you from the beginning

33
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,640
to prevent you from getting involved in this dispute?

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,200
Don't help Lin Feng anymore. Also,

35
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,600
Don't get involved in this dispute.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,800
Okay.

37
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,960
Anyway,

38
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,040
Now you know everything about me.

39
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,320
I only have a cheap life.

40
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,640
Do whatever you want.

41
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,600
I played a trick today.

42
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,160
I was wrong.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,960
Even so,

44
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,760
I'm willing to tell you the truth.

45
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,960
How do I know if you're telling the truth or not?

46
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,640
I swear if I lie,

47
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,240
I will grow old with you.

48
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,720
You are...

49
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,840
This is the worst oath.

50
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,040
If you lie,

51
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,200
punish me for not being able to grow old with you.

52
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,440
Then...

53
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,120
What do you mean?

54
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,120
Make a wish.

55
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,280
I like you.

56
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,600
But I'm a thief.

57
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,440
You may be a thief,

58
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,640
you are the kindest person in the world.

59
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,440
You care about the world

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,400
and saved the refugees in the city.

61
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,840
You are kind.

62
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,480
I was right about you.

63
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,840
But you're too reckless.

64
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,320
You should think it over.

65
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,320
This is the result of my careful consideration.

66
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,880
Don't be so nervous.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,800
I'm just telling you my decision.

68
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,360
As for what you think,

69
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,640
it's up to you.

70
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,240
Jo Bo-ah.

71
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,440
Let me ask you a question.

72
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,040
Do you like me?

73
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,400
So beautiful.

74
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,560
So you're the legitimate daughter?

75
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,240
My mother's family, Ye family, gradually fell.

76
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,280
Zhao used her power to threaten my father.

77
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,240
I didn't know what happened when I was young.

78
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,200
I thought my mother was too weak

79
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,280
I didn't know how to compete for favor.

80
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,240
I thought I was smart

81
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,840
and wanted to help my mother win the favor.

82
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,560
But I've exposed my talent.

83
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,000
I made the Zhao family desperate

84
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,080
and killed him.

85
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,600
When did Che learn to shoot so well?

86
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,600
What did I teach you?

87
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,720
Don't expose yourself.

88
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,120
Mind your words and actions.

89
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,400
Why didn't you listen?

90
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,680
Mother, you are the princess.

91
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,720
Our food and clothing are half as good as the ones next door.

92
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,160
My classmates laughed at me.

93
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,760
They said I have no parents.

94
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,000
I need to make the inkstone brush into a broom.

95
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,000
Che.

96
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,000
It’s my fault.

97
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,320
You must be careful with your words and actions in the mansion.

98
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,640
Don't expose yourself.

99
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,760
You'd better play dumb.

100
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,920
You must live.

101
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,960
Pretend to be sick

102
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,720
Pretend to be weak and narcissistic

103
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,080
He doesn't do his job to survive.

104
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
He's not a narcissist.

105
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,040
He's really narcissistic.

106
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,000
Really.

107
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,159
By the way,

108
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,360
why did you make me unconscious on our wedding day?

109
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,520
I didn't lie to you.

110
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,320
I didn't want to touch you.

111
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,960
You belong to the Zhao family.

112
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,040
I have to know more about you.

113
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,160
Then why were you so anxious

114
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,960
on the second day I entered the mansion?

115
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,920
The deceased wife's tombstone?

116
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,880
Yes.

117
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,360
That's the ancestral tablet I secretly made for my mother.

118
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,400
Your mother?

119
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,040
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,520
It's strange.

121
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,080
no one dares to mention Ye family.

122
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
It's really weird.

123
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,040
I heard from Rou that

124
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,600
Ye was executed for adultery.

125
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,960
so he ordered

126
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,600
not to be buried in the royal mansion.

127
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,960
and put them in the ancestral tablet.

128
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,800
Che, remember what I said.

129
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,560
Mom.

130
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,640
Che.

131
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,240
Mother.

132
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,840
Mother.

133
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,000
Che.

134
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,600
Mom.

135
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:53,960
Che.

136
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,960
Young Master.

137
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,560
Young Master!

138
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,360
Mother.

139
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,360
Young Master.

140
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,840
Young Master, come back!

141
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,080
Mother!

142
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,080
Mother.

143
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,880
Remember what you said.

144
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,640
Mother.

145
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,760
Mother.

146
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,920
It's just a false charge.

147
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,400
I found someone who can prove my mother's innocence recently.

148
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,160
Do you remember the hairpin in the dark market?

149
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,720
It belonged to my mother.

150
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,440
In that case, it's not far to clear your mother's name.

151
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
It won't be that easy.

152
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,560
Father loves Jo Myung Joo deeply.

153
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,400
Being soft-hearted is his biggest weakness.

154
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,880
So, to clear your name,

155
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,280
I must gain His Highness's trust

156
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,240
and take the throne back.

157
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,320
You have no right to speak.

158
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,800
Who cares about your mother?

159
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,880
Tell me, how can we help you?

160
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,920
We will do anything.

161
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,280
The mansion is full of bloodshed.

162
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,200
I can't let you get involved in this.

163
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,520
Don't underestimate us.

164
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,880
We're doing our best.

165
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,760
You're smart.

166
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,080
We may not be as good as you

167
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,640
But in terms of

168
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,880
in the market,

169
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,760
You're not as good as us.

170
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,240
To put it bluntly,

171
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,040
We're gangsters.

172
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,160
That's right. barefoot people are not afraid of wearing shoes.

173
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,400
Yeah

174
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,240
Look at you.

175
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,400
I can see that

176
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,760
A fair lady has nothing to do with you.

177
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,000
Is this ruffian something to brag about?

178
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,120
You're so proud.

179
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,960
Anyway, we need to join the battle.

180
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,120
Let's form an alliance.

181
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,520
No.

182
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,560
Sword is ruthless.

183
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,720
I can't put you in danger.

184
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,760
We just think you'll become a good prince

185
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,200
and a good prince.

186
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,680
right?

187
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,120
Yes.

188
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,160
How about we make a bet?

189
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,280
If we can help you solve the problem

190
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,680
