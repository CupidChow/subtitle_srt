1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Xiangshan He Shun Film Co., Ltd. Ltd. Ltd. Ltd.

2
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,800
I hope Zhao Bao'er

3
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,319
is not as bad as the rumor.

4
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,920
This maid...

5
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,000
No, Sister.

6
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,240
We can't touch the dowry.

7
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,520
According to our family motto,

8
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,759
rob the rich and help the poor.

9
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,000
They only want to be rich and merciless.

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,240
You can't do that. You can't do that.

11
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,640
It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal.

12
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,320
The Zhao family seized it.

13
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,360
by the Zhao family.

14
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,280
Besides,

15
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,520
Zhao Bao'er was almost forced to die for love.

16
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,640
The Zhao family deserved it.

17
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,920
Can this birthmark work?

18
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,680
It's fine.

19
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,040
The Lin family has never seen what Zhao Bao'er looks like anyway.

20
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,520
Once we enter the Lin Mansion,

21
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,280
we'll be free.

22
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,560
Sister, I trust you.

23
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,160
Jo Bo-ah is saved.

24
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,280
and the refugees.

25
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,440
We can kill two birds with one stone this time.

26
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,040
Why is there an orange on the ground?

27
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,360
Yes.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,040
Dear.

29
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,079
Cui has been an ordinary girl since she was young.

30
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,960
She personally cares about it.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,040
Please don't expose her and break her heart.

32
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,520
Don't worry.

33
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,760
A girl should respect her heart.

34
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,840
Let me see what is the treasure in the Zhao family.

35
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,080
What is it?

36
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,480
Nothing.

37
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,320
Jo Bo-ah

38
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,440
is not that ugly.

39
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,000
Look at his figure.

40
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,560
Look at this. Look at this.

41
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,080
Yes.

42
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,560
Bring me what you dropped.

43
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,680
Yes.

44
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,400
Do you really want to read this wooden book?

45
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,760
Let's see what the Zhao family is hiding.

46
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,360
to hide.

47
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,360
I'm doing this for your own good.

48
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,360
If I do,

49
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,200
you might be different.

50
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,320
It turns out that the Zhao family's dowry

51
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,159
is used to teach their daughter and son-in-law.

52
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,640
Here.

53
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,960
I didn't expect a woman like you

54
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,880
to see such a dirty thing.

55
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,920
Sister.

56
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,840
After he goes into the bridal chamber alone,

57
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,000
you'll create chaos.

58
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,080
I'll take the chance

59
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,440
take this pill.

60
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,520
they will think

61
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,160
really killed herself.

62
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,920
That way, Zhao Bao'er can be fulfilled.

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,120
Filial piety and filial piety.

64
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,200
We won't hurt the Zhao family in the Western State.

65
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,080
Understood.

66
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,240
I always advise

67
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,480
women shouldn't be too indulgent.

68
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,080
But I think

69
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,000
everyone has a secret affair.

70
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,600
It was my fault.

71
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,200
You're right. You're right.

72
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,680
I don't have that kind of desire.

73
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,000
I can't explain.

74
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,960
I'll hang up now.

75
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,760
But there's one thing

76
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,240
I don't understand.

77
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,800
What is it?

78
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,360
Although I'm called Master Tsu

79
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,880
you can't be like this

80
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,280
My wife asked me to go back and look at the bronze mirror.

81
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
I did.

82
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,680
From any angle,

83
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,040
it's still perfect.

84
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,240
You're still a gentleman.

85
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,159
You...

86
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,680
You drugged me.

87
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,160
Mother.

88
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,800
What are you doing?

89
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,000
Look, look, look, look.

90
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,440
I forgot.

91
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,840
to pick up my sister.

92
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,440
Don't worry about your sister.

93
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,520
She is known as

94
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,480
known as the God of Bandits.

95
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,360
She'll be back soon.

96
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,080
Sleep.

97
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,320
Okay.

98
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,120
I lost my virginity.

99
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,600
Why don't I feel anything?

100
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,480
Monster!

101
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,640
You pervert!

102
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,080
Be careful. Be careful.

103
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,600
Vicious.

104
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,800
So evil.

105
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,480
Sign the card before you die.

106
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,760
Okay.

107
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,680
I made my wish.

108
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,160
Today, I will enforce justice on behalf of heaven.

109
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,880
and see who will die today.

110
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,960
Young Madam.

111
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,960
You're awake. What are you doing?

112
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,799
Your son...

113
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,280
Where is my husband?

114
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,600
Young Master is waiting for Young Madam in the study.

115
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,360
to serve tea to His Highness and Her Highness.

116
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,720
Okay.

117
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,720
Lend it to me.

118
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,480
Young Madam, where are you going with the feather duster?

119
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,040
Lecher, kill me!

120
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,560
How dare you!

121
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,320
Bastard!

122
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,600
Madam, stop it.

123
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,840
I didn't expect

124
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,280
you know kung fu.

125
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,120
None of your business.

126
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,240
Lecher.

127
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,400
First of all,

128
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,160
Who is a lecher?

129
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,080
Of course it's you.

130
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,880
Why did you make me unconscious?

131
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,560
I'm afraid you'll harass me.

132
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,000
