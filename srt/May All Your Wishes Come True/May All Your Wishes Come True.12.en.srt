1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Xiangshan He Shun Film Co., Ltd.

2
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,160
Sister.

3
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,480
Are you okay?

4
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,280
You're not feeling well, right?

5
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,720
Sister, what's going on? I haven't...

6
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,280
You...

7
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,320
Waiting for you to save me.

8
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,160
I'm cold.

9
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,840
I'll get changed later.

10
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,840
That's my sister.

11
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,760
Where's Ye?

12
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,080
He's so young.

13
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,160
Why is he called Ye?

14
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,360
I didn’t know Lin Che called me that.

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,880
Oh.

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,000
Over there

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,560
I like pork elbow very much.

18
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,360
Really I'll ask the chef to cook for you

19
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,240
Great.

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,080
Your clothes are not right.

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,720
Do you think so?

22
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,240
You have to wear it like this.

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,440
You have to put this here.

24
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,800
That's cool

25
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,880
Thank you.

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,280
I knew it.

27
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,720
I'll sort it out for you.

28
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,800
I can do it myself.

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
That's cool

30
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,880
You look good in it.

31
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,600
Go back to work.

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,759
I'm leaving.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,800
Bye.

34
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,640
Come with me.

35
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,320
What?

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,400
Oh no, I forgot about this.

37
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,440
What's wrong?

38
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,480
You go first.

39
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,040
Go to the rice shop first. Who will take me away?

40
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,920
Leave me alone.

41
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:33,960
What about you?

42
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,240
Leave me alone.

43
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,040
Okay.

44
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,440
That's a decoction to relieve the poison.

45
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,800
I'm afraid you don't have many days left.

46
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,680
I'm so mad.

47
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,640
I was about to save the hero.

48
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,520
I don't know where Wen Youcai came from.

49
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,040
The idiots I hired

50
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,400
who I hired.

51
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,240
I shouldn't have saved that much.

52
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,960
I should hire some strong men.

53
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,000
Have you

54
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,520
Have you noticed anything?

55
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,720
That's quite something.

56
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,079
Tell me.

57
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,560
Come on.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,520
Lin Che is actually strong.

59
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,880
and muscular.

60
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,480
He has a strong body.

61
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,480
More importantly, he has internal strength.

62
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,760
Interesting.

63
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,360
You took credit to His Highness

64
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,040
to save your life, right?

65
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Of course not.

66
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,680
The Crown Prince is a smart man.

67
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,600
How could I use such a foolish method

68
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,360
to test your IQ?

69
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,240
It's just that the poison is coming.

70
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,159
I deliberately set a trap for you.

71
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,560
Please protect me.

72
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,080
so that I won't let you down.

73
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,440
Please tell me.

74
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,920
I will raise the rice price

75
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,760
in Lin Che’s name

76
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,680
and ruin his reputation.

77
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,280
Okay.

78
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,560
You exchange the results with me for the antidote three days later.

79
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,360
Yes.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,680
It's so expensive.

81
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,000
Stop arguing.

82
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,640
Hit him.

83
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,680
Beat him!

84
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,800
You want us to die?

85
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,520
Shameless!

86
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,040
What’s going on?

87
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,280
Mr. Che ordered it.

88
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,240
What?

89
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,080
Yes.

90
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,120
Why did you raise the rice price?

91
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,760
Three days have passed.

92
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,880
Have you made up your mind?

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,560
Why did you raise the rice price?

94
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,080
To make money.

95
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,000
I asked the rice shop to supervise the rice price.

96
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,040
That's your conspiracy.

97
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,720
I won’t do it.

98
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,880
Lin Che.

99
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,920
Uncle Qi just sent off his daughter

100
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
and sent his daughter away.

101
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,960
He regretted it.

102
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,600
Because he didn't know until the last moment

103
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,240
his daughter kept lying to him

104
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,240
to give him food.

105
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,960
Now he's dead.

106
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,960
That's Miss Zhao.

107
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,640
She has nothing to eat.

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,240
So there's no milk.

109
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,280
I had no choice.

110
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,400
She can only feed her child

111
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,520
with her own blood.

112
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,840
And him.

113
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,720
He...

114
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,440
They…

115
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,440
Why, Lin Che?

116
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:45,760
It’s unnecessary.

117
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,800
It's really unnecessary.

118
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,040
A few taels of silver

119
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,280
may be a cup of new tea

120
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,280
or some snacks.

121
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,240
But for them,

122
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,200
a few taels of silver can save their parents and siblings.

123
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,560
Do you know him?

124
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,960
Is that the point?

125
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,280
There are so many poor people in this world.

126
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
Can you help them all?

127
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,920
Are you not helping because you can't?

128
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,720
Besides, you're different from them.

129
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,360
You are the son of His Highness.

130
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,080
You have the responsibility to protect one side.

131
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,280
You should be the people's food and clothing.

132
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,560
to protect them.

133
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,520
But now?

134
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,560
you ate the grain they took for the royal family

135
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,800
and hurt your people.

136
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,400
I was right about you.

137
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,120
I'll help you ask His Highness for credit

138
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,440
and fulfill your wish.

139
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,480
Don't work for Lin Feng anymore.

140
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,159
Also,

141
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,720
don't get involved in this dispute.

142
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,200
You...

143
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,240
Look.

144
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,040
It's time to see people's hearts.

145
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,240
Ye.

146
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,440
It's Young Master.

147
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Take it easy.

148
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,680
Lin Che

149
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,040
raised the grain price

150
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,120
the grain price of all rice shops in Yongzhou.

151
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,600
Some shops are out of greed.

152
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,200
Some don't dare to offend you.

153
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,560
and raised the price.

154
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,960
I shouldn't have trusted him.

155
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,160
I told you.

156
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,560
A man's mouth

157
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,800
A liar.

158
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,960
I...

159
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,200
Just tell me what we should do now.

160
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,240
We have to change the plan.

161
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,159
I'm afraid stealing the rice shop will become a target.

162
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,840
Steal a private bank?

163
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,400
If refugees have money,

164
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,280
they should buy grain.

165
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,120
No one can control us.

166
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,640
Youcai, search our goal.

167
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,680
Let me see who is the lucky one.

168
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,040
Jiu Si Private Bank is notorious.

169
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,840
and made a fortune.

170
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,960
After the refugees from the North infiltrated Yongzhou,

171
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,280
increased the interest by three times.

172
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,720
and double the profit.

173
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,080
He even put up the blood mark.

174
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,760
Okay, it's him.

175
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,360
Get ready.

176
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,360
The bandit family has opened.

177
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,000
You want to leave?

178
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,160
Sure.

179
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,000
Take me with you.

180
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:23,640
Roada Xu who made a wish.

181
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:23,920
Wen Youcai, Han Haotian.

182
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,280
Wen Youcai, Han Haotian.

183
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,600
Lin Rou, Chen Chuqi.

184
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,240
Lin Feng Yi, Jin Wangwang.

185
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,920
Lin Yan and Yang Jun.

186
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,240
Lucky, Tan Yinmin.

187
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:26,840
Qian Youfu Yi, Guo Chang.

188
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,200
Zhao Mingzhu, Liu Lingling.

189
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,520
Zhao Mingzhu, Liu Lingling.

190
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,160
Lin Dao Cheng, Feng Wusheng.

191
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,440
Ye Zi, Yi, Yi, Yi.

192
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,760
