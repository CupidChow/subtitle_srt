3
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,920
It's time to get up.

4
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,160
Your Highness.

5
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,560
Princess Consort.

6
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,560
Time to get up.

7
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,120
Your Highness.

8
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,080
Princess Consort, help!

9
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,760
Her Highness has passed away.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,800
Honey, I'm back.

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,880
You're back.

12
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,680
Pour me a glass of water.

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,440
Are you tired?

14
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,240
No.

15
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,680
Have some tea.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,520
How do you feel

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,320
How do you feel?

18
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,480
Let me tell you.

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,680
Today is the first day of the court.

20
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,640
Murderer!

21
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,360
Murderer!

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,000
Kill my mother!

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,880
A life for a life!

24
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,880
Yan'er.

25
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,880
What are you doing?

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,000
Brother.

27
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,920
Don't make any more mistakes.

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,560
The sea of bitterness is endless.

29
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,080
and turn back.

30
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,080
He killed my mother.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,240
What did you do to my mother?

32
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,640
to make her condition deteriorate?

33
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,600
Zhao never hugged you when you were young.

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
Do you know why?

35
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,080
Why?

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,440
You're not her biological daughter.

37
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,640
Impossible.

38
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,039
If you don't believe me,

39
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,080
you can do a blood test.

40
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,360
I'm not the one you should hate.

41
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,440
but her.

42
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,520
You are just a tool for her to fight for power.

43
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,960
And your bloodline

44
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,720
have never been qualified to be the crown prince.

45
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,160
Isn't that ridiculous?

46
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,160
Brother.

47
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,840
No way.

48
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,520
Brother.

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,160
No way.

50
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,320
Impossible.

51
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,160
I'll kill you.

52
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,800
Yan'er.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,960
Yan'er.

54
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,120
Yan'er.

55
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,920
Brother.

56
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,200
Don't make any more mistakes.

57
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,520
Don't make any more mistakes.

58
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,920
Yan'er, why are you doing this?

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,800
Brother.

60
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,040
Make yourself happy.

61
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,120
Yan'er.

62
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,960
Yan'er!

63
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,760
Yan'er.

64
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,320
Yan'er.

65
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,640
When did you ask for a letter from His Majesty?

66
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,200
When the rice price of Yongzhou fell,

67
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,640
when the rice price of Yongzhou declined.

68
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,760
She will definitely expose you

69
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,360
to make you known.

70
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,040
His Majesty was happy then.

71
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,040
It was also a good time for us to report.

72
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,000
So you knew

73
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,959
when the Zhao family reaches this point,

74
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,640
she will lose favor.

75
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,240
That's right.

76
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,600
What if you fail?

77
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,240
His Majesty won't spare me.

78
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,240
you have to divorce me.

79
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,400
I

80
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,320
I won't divorce you even if I divorce the people in the world.

81
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,040
No way.

82
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,159
You have to be a good prince.

83
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
Don't waste it.

84
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,520
You belong to the world.

85
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,000
I belong to the world.

86
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,360
but I belong to you too.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,840
Lin Che. Yes?

88
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,560
I didn’t know you were so calculative.

89
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,440
Of course.

90
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,720
I’m good at

91
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,440
and calculating.

92
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,440
Have you calculated this?

93
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,320
How dare you trick me?

94
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,560
By the way,

95
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,280
how did your eyes get better?

96
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,200
My wife made me fall off the wall.

97
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,240
I fell down from the wall.

98
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,040
You want to fall?

99
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,159
You should have told me earlier.

100
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,280
We're willing

101
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,480
to do this job.

102
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,120
The famous doctor His Majesty found said he broke the bruises in his brain.

103
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,040
It will be fine.

104
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,480
I didn't expect

105
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,320

106
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,800
