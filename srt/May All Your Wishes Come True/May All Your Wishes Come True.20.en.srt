1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Xiangshan Firm Co., Ltd. Ltd. Ltd. Ltd. Ltd. Ltd. Ltd. Ltd.

2
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,600
No.

3
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,920
What's wrong? What's wrong?

4
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,480
Why are you...

5
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,000
I only give you two hours.

6
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,280
Do as I say.

7
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,480
Dear.

8
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,920
The wedding night.

9
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,400
We haven't finished the merging wine yet.

10
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,720
Let's make it up today.

11
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,080
Okay.

12
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,759
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,960
I can't do it.

14
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,400
I can’t.

15
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,280
Lin Che! Come on!

16
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,640
Che!

17
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,120
Doctor, save him!

18
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,520
You can't get your head cured.

19
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,960
What a coincidence, Your Highness.

20
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,760
The guards and doctors are here.

21
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,200
I'm afraid it's not predictable.

22
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,960
Please spare my life, Your Highness.

23
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,320
Mr. Lin has been poisoned for two hours.

24
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,560
He can't come back to life.

25
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm powerless.

26
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Take him down and behead him.

27
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,640
Please spare my life.

28
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,120
Please spare my life!

29
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,240
Please spare my life!

30
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,680
Please spare my life.

31
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,079
Tell me.

32
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,480
what is love?

33
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,240
[can't resist human selfishness.]

34
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,760
Arrest the prostitute who killed Che.

35
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,560
Wait.

36
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,160
I've done what I promised you.

37
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,320
Where is the antidote?

38
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,240
What antidote?

39
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,000
Don't bite me.

40
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,600
I think His Highness has lost his memory.

41
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,760
Let me help you recall.

42
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,800
The maid Chun who drugged Ye

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,720
colluded with the guards in the mansion.

44
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,880
She has been hiding a daughter in the mansion.

45
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,600
Everyone in the mansion knows about this.

46
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,240
Nonsense.

47
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,040
You can leave now.

48
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,200
Guard at the door.

49
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:51,240
This woman is the witness who was drugged

50
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,120
who was drugged to the side room.

51
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,159
because of his illegitimate child,

52
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,800
because of his illegitimate child.

53
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,000
The Crown Prince must have killed the wrong person.

54
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,440
So what?

55
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,520
Lin Che is dead.

56
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,280
Who cares about the past?

57
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,520
Anyone can fabricate witnesses.

58
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,240
Why do you think people will believe you?

59
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,880
The testimony of a murderer.

60
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,480
I told you.

61
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,520
I can help you completely remove his worries.

62
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,680
As long as you give me the antidote,

63
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,920
I can tell you where she is.

64
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,000
I killed Lin Che.

65
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,040
You should believe

66
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,480
I... I am very useful to His Highness.

67
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,520
You stole the antidote.

68
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,680
Lin Che won’t hurt you.

69
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,480
I know that better than you.

70
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,520
Make your wish come true.

71
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,920
You killed your husband for your own benefit.

72
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,400
Do you think I will still believe you?

73
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,360
Your Highness, did you hear that?

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,240
His Highness didn't deny

75
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,320
the Ye family was poisoned and framed by Zhao family.

76
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,520
Bastard!

77
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,200
Help! Help! Help!

78
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,000
Guards!

79
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,400
Take this beast out!

80
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,200
Father!

81
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,760
It's not like that, Father.

82
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:36,960
Father.

83
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,200
Father.

84
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,360
It's not like that, Father.

85
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,240
I have my reasons.

86
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:48,960
I did it

87
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,000
the Zhao family of Yongzhou intentionally murdered Ye family.

88
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,520
and reversed the truth.

89
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,800
and caused Ye family to be wronged.

90
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,720
and colluded with merchants.

91
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,760
and maliciously raised the grain price of Yongzhou

92
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,320
and defamed the reputation of the mansion.

93
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,280
and be cautious with the mansion.

94
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:03,840
Respect.

95
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,680
and benevolence.

96
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,560
Practice.

97
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:05,920
Work hard.

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,520
The family motto goes against the rules.

99
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
and cane him 20 times according to the family rules.

100
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,160
I didn't mean it, Your Highness.

101
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,640
Your Highness, Lin Feng is ruthless.

102
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
He's so powerful.

103
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,800
You didn't report it.

104
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,880
She poisoned her to threaten her family

105
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,320
to help Zhao hide the truth

106
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,240
to get rid of their family.

107
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,240
by any means.

108
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,440
[I cannot set an example for the royal family.]

109
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,120
I hereby dismiss the title of Crown Prince of Linfeng.

110
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,000
and be demoted to the second son.

111
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,000
He did it wrong to save the Lin family.

112
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,120
Your Highness.

113
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,160
My mother's family is more powerful than her family.

114
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,240
I love you more than her.

115
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,880
and I can help you.

116
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,560
Your Highness.

117
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,440
Stop.

118
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,040
Your Highness.

119
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,160
Since ancient times, a life for a life.

120
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,440
As you wish.

121
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,000
Don't be sad.

122
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,799
Zhao has been favored for so many years.

123
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,480
Falling down is not a matter of time.

124
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,280
The evil will suffer.

125
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,600
She will seek her own death.

126
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,960
Good people don't live long.

127
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,000
A disaster lasts a thousand years.

128
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,480
Why?

129
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,760
If we want to save him,

130
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,440
I'll make him turn back.

131
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:57,880
Xu Zi Yin made a wish.

132
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,200
Xu Zi Yin.

133
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,480

Lin Dao Cheng, Feng Wusheng.

142
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:02,680
Leaf, one, one, one, one, one, one, one.

143
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,000
A leaf will lead to a war.

144
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,640
A Lian, Xu Shiyao.

145
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,000
