1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Xiangshan He Shun Film Co., Ltd.

2
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,000
Action.

3
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,479
What took you so long?

4
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,640
What's going on, little fool?

5
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,960
No hurry.

6
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,960
Let's take our time.

7
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,080
Come on.

8
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,560
Hurry up.

9
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,440
I found something.

10
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,720
Look, I found a treasure box.

11
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,040
Wake up.

12
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,720
You are my guest.

13
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,640
Welcome, guest of honor.

14
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,680
Sorry for not welcoming you.

15
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:49,960
What brings you all here?

16
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,400
Let me guess.

17
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,400
Are you here

18
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:55,680
to steal?

19
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,480
No.

20
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,040
Absolutely not.

21
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,640
You have the key to the warehouse.

22
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,280
Are you here for dinner?

23
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,040
We're here for cats.

24
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,480
We lost a raccoon that has been keeping for seven years.

25
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,279
Yes.

26
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,240
Do you think I'm a fool?

27
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,920
Thief is not done by a gentleman.

28
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,440
Don't do such

29
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,280
such a despicable thing.

30
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,920
Humph.

31
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,160
You're full of benevolence and morality.

32
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,800
A bunch of thieves and women.

33
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,000
Don't you feel guilty for what you've done?

34
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,200
What did we do?

35
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,560
We're making a fortune.

36
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,760
Release the blood mark.

37
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,920
We are here to rob the rich and help the poor.

38
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,080
and enforce justice.

39
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,800
What a joke.

40
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,920
Our boss lost money to help the refugees.

41
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,480
The honor of Jiu's Private Bank

42
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,040
can’t be slandered by you.

43
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,320
Nine.

44
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:52,920
We...

45
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,360
Wait.

46
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:54,400
Yes.

47
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:54,920
What is it?

48
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,720
Nine.

49
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,680
Bank?

50
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,200
This...

51
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,040
What's going on?

52
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,280
What's going on?

53
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:02,960
I don't know.

54
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,680
It's your fault.

55
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,360
We only care about the signboard.

56
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,880
That's JiuMitsui Private Bank.

57
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,480
It's totally different from the notes.

58
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,760
Fine.

59
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,040
You are illiterate.

60
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,400
We are here to rob the rich and help the poor.

61
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,720
Since we're all trying to help the refugees,

62
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,880
It's just a misunderstanding.

63
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,880
Please forgive me.

64
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,680
Please spare us.

65
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,320
We will recite sutras for you.

66
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,840
Bless Jiu's Private Bank to be famous.

67
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,320
I’m afraid you have to ask our boss.

68
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,159
Our boss prepared two kinds of punishment.

69
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,200
The first is cooking.

70
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,920
It means to strip you naked

71
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,440
and boil hot water in the pot.

72
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,240
and scream.

73
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,040
your meat

74
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,840
will slowly be separated.

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We'll add more firewood.

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,800
Enough.

77
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,320
Stop it.

78
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,680
I don't know what's better.

79
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,120
No.

80
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,280
This is abuse of personal punishment.

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,960
There's no need to steal.

82
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,480
Did you see the delicate girl next to you?

83
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,000
Do you know who she is?

84
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,560
Yes.

85
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,560
You look like the moon.

86
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,320
Skin is better than snow.

87
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,640
My eyes are like a clear water.

88
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,480
When I was looking forward to it,

89
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,200
not to show you her face.

90
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,960
She is the princess of our dynasty.

91
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,560
As long as you let us go home today,

92
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,880
we will pay back

93
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,320
will be paid back.

94
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,360
and 10,000 taels of gold.

95
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Yes.

96
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,680
We were going to let you go, but...

97
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,280
we wanted to let you go.

98
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,360
But you said the princess is here.

99
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,760
We have no choice but

100
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,880
kill you.

101
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,520
Once His Highness finds out,

102
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,040
he won't let us off.

103
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,960
Even if you dress like this,

104
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,840
even if you dress like this.

105
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,560
Who knows she's here?

106
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,080
Everyone in the mansion knows where we are going.

107
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,480
Yes.

108
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,880
I won't admit it.

109
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,080
Will they still say

110
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
you came to my bank to steal?

111
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,800
We'll die anyway.

112
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,800
I'll kill them!

113
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,880
I...

114
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,320
Hero.

115
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,520
Wrong.

116
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,120
Go back.

117
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,480
Go back.

118
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,600
You stepped on my clothes.

119
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,960
Actually, it’s not that complicated.

120
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,560
Our boss said

121
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,720
we can let you go

122
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,560
we can let you go.

123
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,160
How would I know

124
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,160
your boss will keep his promise?

125
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,680
Right?

126
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,800
Do you have any conditions to talk to me?

127
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,440
Since you treat me politely,

128
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,800
we should trust you.

129
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,320
Have you heard of the God of Bandits?

130
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,040
The God of Bandits who saved the refugees in the city?

131
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,200
Exactly.

132
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
We did mean to rob the rich and help the poor.

133
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,000
But we found the wrong place.

134
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,440
Please forgive me.

135
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,720
It is said that the God of Bandits has gone without a trace.

136
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,000
No one has ever seen his true face.

137
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,039
How can you prove it?

138
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,800
How can there be anyone in this world without showing a trace?

139
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,040
But the people and refugees we helped

140
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,480
never betray us.

141
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,240
The God of Bandits is never alone.

142
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,320
but four.

143
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,280
Although we are not related by blood,

144
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,800
we've already become family under the peach garden.

145
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,680
This is my father.

146
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,920
Qian Lai Fu.

147
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,600
He's good at making weapons.

148
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,560
It's me.

149
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,000
This is my mother.

150
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,440
Lucky Du is good at inner arts.

151
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,040
This is my sister.

152
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,480
She's the core of our team.

153
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,440
Sister.

154
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,040
You are Lin Che?

155
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,800
You are Lin Che.

156
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,480
Brother.

157
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,120
Lin Che.

158
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,880
Is it really you?

159
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,000
Brother.

160
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,960
Let go of us.

161
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,160
It hurts.

162
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,360
Brother.

163
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,400
Stop it!

164
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,360
Brother.

165
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,640
It's really you.

166
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,600
How could you do this?

167
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,600
Lin Rou.

168
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,040
How dare you

169
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,840
How dare you do sneaky things with them?

170
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,640
And you made your wish.

171
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,160
You hid it from me so hard.

172
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,400
I'm far away from Zhao Bao'er.

173
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,680
I don’t believe you didn’t notice it.

174
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,280
Where are you going?

175
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,640
Don't you dare hurt my daughter!

176
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,960
