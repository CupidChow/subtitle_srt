1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Xiangshan He Shun Film Co., Ltd.

2
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,920
When did this happen?

3
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,600
Do you have evidence?

4
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,600
You want evidence?

5
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,680
Okay.

6
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,240
What's going on?

7
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,760
Wait here.

8
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,920
Ye!

9
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,160
Ye!

10
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,320
Young Master.

11
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,160
Ye!

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,800
Ye!

13
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,800
Ye!

14
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,840
Young Master.

15
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,280
Ye!

16
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,680
Ye!

17
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,840
I failed to protect the witness.

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,600
It's a crime.

19
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,960
Ye!

20
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,240
Ye!

21
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,280
Her Highness hid your identity for you.

22
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,760
and taught you manners.

23
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,920
She treats you as her own daughter.

24
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,200
How dare you say she colluded with merchants

25
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,880
and framed her for killing Ye family.

26
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,920
My mother didn't trust you entirely.

27
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,079
I was the one who put in a good word for her.

28
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,800
Now you're fighting in your den.

29
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,480
You're such an ungrateful person.

30
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:41,880
I'm framed!

31
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,240
How is that a false accusation?

32
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,120
25 years ago,

33
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,720
my mansion was in trouble.

34
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,760
My mother was willing to marry you as a concubine.

35
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,160
to be a concubine.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,800
Even when the Ye family was alive,

37
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,160
His Highness still dotes on Mother.

38
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,760
Ye's affair.

39
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,240
My mother hid it for her

40
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,280
until she couldn't hold back the fire.

41
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
I had to expose

42
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,200
My mother didn't eat or drink.

43
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,800
and guarded her tomb for days.

44
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,280
To make up for her debt,

45
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,160
she treats Lin Che better than us.

46
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,640
She’s so pure and kind.

47
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,440
How dare you say she colluded with merchants

48
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,079
and framed her for killing Ye family?

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,480
Since you're so upright,

50
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,120
why do you feel guilty?

51
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,720
Why did you kill him?

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,800
Ridiculous!

53
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,000
Even His Highness can't tell who killed Butler Ye.

54
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,560
You're wise

55
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,360
The play you're playing

56
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Why are you asking me?

57
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,280
Liar has three levels.

58
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Lies.

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,160
Lies are the first priority.

60
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,800
Only one lie.

61
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,480
The rest are the truth. The second level.

62
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,560
The scariest thing in deception

63
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,760
is the third level.

64
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,120
You lied to yourself.

65
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,560
You even believe in yourself.

66
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,160
There are no flaws.

67
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,279
Sometimes,

68
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,040
I really feel sorry for you.

69
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,120
Do you know why you always lie to yourself?

70
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,880
Because the real you

71
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,480
You're the one who hates it.

72
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,760
make a wish.

73
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,960
Do you think you got the antidote

74
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,480
and His Highness trusts you,

75
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,440
you can do whatever you want.

76
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:48,960
What?

77
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,640
You think I don’t know you got the antidote?

78
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,360
You deliberately revealed the location of the antidote?

79
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,240
No.

80
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,880
It's not the antidote.

81
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,120
It can be delayed.

82
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,320
Oh, right.

83
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,640
if your meridians float on the surface,

84
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,720
it means

85
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,480
the poison is coming.

86
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,880
Do you want to know who told me?

87
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,320
I don't care.

88
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,800
No, you do.

89
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,360
Think about who knows about this.

90
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,440
He used your secret

91
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,600
with your secret.

92
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,280
Wake up and make a wish.

93
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,640
He already knew who you are.

94
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,040
Why didn't you say anything?

95
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,760
He just wants you to help him get the throne.

96
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,240
He's not the kind of person who fights for power.

97
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,320
What a joke.

98
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,200
What level do you know about him?

99
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,800
We grew up together.

100
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,360
I've stepped on more tricks than you.

101
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,640
How about we make a deal?

102
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,000
Although there was no solid evidence last night,

103
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,920
he did suspect you.

104
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
I can help you to clear his suspicion.

105
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,600
No need.

106
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,360
If you don't agree,

107
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,960
I can only report this to His Highness.

108
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,200
and let him decide whether I can get the antidote

109
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,000
and continue to win His Majesty's favor.

110
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,080
Hey.

111
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,600
I have a friendly suggestion.

112
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,400
I told you Lin Che betrayed you long ago.

113
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,159
You said you’d help us to clear Prince’s suspicion.

114
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,080
Since you want to betray us,

115
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,720
why don't

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,880
be more thorough?

117
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,840
Father, Mother, you...

118
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,120
I'm fine.

119
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,960
Daughter.

120
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:36,920
It doesn't hurt.

121
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,440
I'm fine.

122
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,200
Daughter.

123
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,320
We're fine.

124
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
Don't listen to him.

125
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,360
Gosh.

126
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,400
Make a wish.

127
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,040
Your parents' lives are in your hands now.

128
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,640
If you want them to live,

129
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,600
kill Lin Che.

130
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,280
You!

131
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,080
Father!

132
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,920
Fuzi, what’s wrong?

133
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:07,880
Fuzi!

134
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,680
Father!

135
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,080
Fuzi, are you okay?

136
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,520
Don't scare me.

137
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:18,880
STATE

138
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
This flower

139
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
is

140
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,800
Beautiful.

141
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,280
You haven't named our Little Fu yet.

142
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
No!

143
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,559
No.

144
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,799
Do you want me to kill you?

145
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,520
I'll kill you.

146
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,680
Make a wish.

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No one cares about the life of a thief.

148
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
I only give you two hours.

149
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,520
Do as I say or...

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,200
I promise you.

151
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:25,840
Lin Che is in love.

152
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,120
Xu Zi Yin made a wish.

153
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,480

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,840
