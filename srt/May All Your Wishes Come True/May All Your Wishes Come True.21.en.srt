1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Xiangshan He Shun Film Co., Ltd.

2
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,520
Why do you have to elope?

3
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,400
Fool.

4
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,160
Rou, are you okay?

5
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,960
Long live Your Majesty.

6
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,400
Rise.

7
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,280
Your Majesty.

8
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,000
Uncle, we haven't seen each other for a long time.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,680
Did you break it?

10
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,160
No.

11
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's go.

12
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,960
I heard that this morning,

13
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,080
you signed a petition with the Zhao Party

14
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,680
to sue Xu Ru wishing for concealing his identity

15
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,000
and tricked me and His Majesty.

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,560
Is that true?

17
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:34,920
What?

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,640
You...

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,039
A few days ago,

20
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,080
The lowly bandits stirred up the court.

21
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,840
and bring shame to the royal family.

22
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,160
Your identity as a thief is a hidden danger.

23
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
The paper can’t keep fire.

24
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,840
It will explode soon.

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,039
the mansion will be implicated.

26
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,920
Father, I'm doing this for the sake of the mansion.

27
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,920
Feng'er.

28
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,479
I know what you're up to.

29
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,039
After what you did,

30
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,560
what do you think of me?

31
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,320
and the dignity of the mansion?

32
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:00,840
Father,

33
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,440
please make a decision as soon as possible.

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,400
To prevent this from implicating the royal mansion,

35
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,199
In my opinion, ask Che to write a divorce letter

36
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,919
to solve this problem.

37
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,240
Good.

38
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,079
You've all grown up.

39
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,640
I don't think I can make the decision in this family.

40
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,480
Father.

41
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,880
You should make a decision.

42
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,520
Please make a decision as soon as possible.

43
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,880
Without the divorce agreement,

44
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,480
I’m afraid Che’s career will be in danger.

45
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,720
What should I do?

46
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,040
If I don’t divorce Lin Che,

47
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,280
it will affect him

48
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,680
for many years.

49
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,360
will be lost because of me.

50
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,880
let alone avenge my father.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,480
What should I do?

52
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,960
Here comes His Majesty!

53
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,920
Long live Your Majesty!

54
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,680
Rise.

55
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

56
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,200
Brother, after so many years,

57
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,560
you still like to be serious.

58
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,880
Please, Your Majesty.

59
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,320
Your Majesty, why are you here?

60
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,800
It's all because of what happened in your mansion.

61
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,800
Your daughter

62
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,360
is capable.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,960
to elope.

64
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,680
Rou.

65
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,440
How could you do such a treacherous thing?

66
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,000
Why are you scaring him?

67
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,560
I'm here today

68
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,560
to come here today.

69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,280
Wen Youcai.

70
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,200
Lucky Du.

71
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,200
Make a wish and receive the decree.

72
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,320
Although you are bandits,

73
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,720
but you are brave and righteous.

74
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,960
to punish evil and promote good.

75
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,160
rob the rich and help the poor.

76
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,600
and save the refugees in the city.

77
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,720
He is hereby conferred the title of the bandit family.

78
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,279
Although I made a wish in the name of Zhao Bao'er,

79
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,360
in the name of Zhao Bao'er,

80
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,480
and married into the royal mansion.

81
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,280
But considering his original intention was to help Zhao Bao'er

82
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,880
to save Zhao Bao'er and Wang Yi.

83
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,080
My merits are even.

84
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,159
After the special approval,

85
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,600
and let it go.

86
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,520
Respect this.

87
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,120
The Thief Family, accept the decree.

88
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,840
Rise.

89
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

90
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,960
I know you lied to me.

91
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,400
Che’s sincerity touched me.

92
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,520
Look.

93
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,400
What is this?

94
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,120
A joint handprint of thousands of refugees.

95
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,680
Zhao Bao'er and Wang Yi's love letters.

96
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,520
The grace records of the people.

97
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,160
are pleading for you every single word.

98
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,640
Water can carry a boat

99
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,040
and overturn the boat.

100
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,920
The people will support him.

101
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,600
By the way, what else was it?

102
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,120
Oh.

103
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,400
Marriage granted.

104
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,000
Lin Rou.

105
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,600
and Wen Youcai.

106
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,200
Take the order.

107
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,840
This...

108
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,360
Your Majesty, my daughter, Lin Rou, is a princess.

109
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,400
How could he marry a mortal?

110
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,240
He used to be a thief.

111
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,320
Brother, you're pedantic.

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,520
Good and evil have nothing to do with identity.

113
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,000
is about virtue.

114
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

115
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,440
Thank you, Your Majesty.

116
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,840
Make a wish.

117
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,520
You married Lin Che

118
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,480
as you wished.

119
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

120
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,120
Your Majesty.

121
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,400
I request a marriage.

122
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,760
Who are you marrying?

123
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,320
I want to marry Qian Lai Fu.

124
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,480
Marrying a dead man

125
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,120
Being a widow after getting married.

126
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,600
It's a wedding day, isn't it?

127
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,080
I'm willing to never get married.

128
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,760
Please grant me a marriage.

129
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay, I'll allow it.

130
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

131
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,840
Her Highness wishes to see you.

132
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,080
I really failed.

133
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,920
Now even you can laugh at me.

134
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,240
and make a wish.

135
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,640
Do you think I won't rise again?

136
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,400
Have you ever given birth to a daughter?

137
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,040
Nonsense!

138
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,800
Everyone in the mansion knows that

139
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,200
I gave birth to a son.

140
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,360
His Highness named him Wind.

141
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,240
Really?

142
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,080
Niao Niao.

143
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,120
You are Niao Niao?

144
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,680
Actually, you were pregnant

145
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,159
you were pregnant, right?

146
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,520
But that child is not His Highness's.

147
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,560
You lied to His Highness

148
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,760
and married into the Lin family.

149
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,800
I just want my mother to have a son.

150
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,200
But I didn't expect my daughter to be born.

151
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,840
I can't be the enemy of Ye family.

152
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,520
You treat me as your own daughter.

153
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,520
and abandoned me as a shield.

154
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,520
You secretly replaced me with Lin Feng

155
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,040
to be your pawn in my place

156
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,280
and complete your plan.

157
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,080
Niao Niao.

158
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,760
Where have you been these years?

159
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,000
I've been looking for you.

160
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,240
Stop being hypocritical.

161
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,560
I'm just a threat to you.

162
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,159
It's a stain in your life.

163
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,120
No, it's not like that.

164
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,960
Niao Niao.

165
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,520
I...

166
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,080
I asked the old lady to send you to a rich family.

167
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,159
How could you...

168
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,640
You probably offended that nanny.

169
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,400
Since young,

170
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,760
she instigated me to steal.

171
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,040
Until she died,

172
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,600
I started wandering around Yongzhou.

173
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,600
and snatched food from the wild dogs in the slums.

174
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,320
Luckily, I met Du Niang.
