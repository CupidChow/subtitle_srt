1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Xiangshan He Shun Film Co., Ltd. Ltd. Ltd. Ltd. Ltd. Ltd. Ltd. Ltd. Ltd.

2
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,240
First of all,

3
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,960
Who is a pervert?

4
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,960
Of course it's you.

5
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,720
Why did you make me unconscious?

6
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,520
I'm afraid you'll harass me.

7
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,760
What did you say?

8
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,960
You carry the painting with you

9
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,960
I look like Elder Tsu

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,240
Of course I'm afraid you're up to no good

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,720
Ridiculous.

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,240
You were the one who wanted to knock me out

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,080
and hurt me.

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,720
Did I do anything to you?

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,200
Didn't you notice?

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,000
I...

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,120
How would I know?

18
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,160
Besides, since you're married to me,

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,720
you're mine now.

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,680
It's fair and square for me to kill you.

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,560
What lecher?

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:18,600
I...

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,320
What?

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,840
There is only one reason for me to do this.

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,440
I don't want to touch you.

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,160
but I'm afraid you'll be sad.

27
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,000
Since you don't want me to touch you,

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,840
That's great.

29
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,440
We can get along peacefully.

30
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,039
Don't act like a thief.

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,759
Who knows what your purpose is?

32
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,560
Maybe you have a special fetish.

33
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,479
Young Master.

34
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,840
The carriage is ready.

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,840
I'll remember this.

36
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,440
I'm not a vegetarian.

37
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,640
Father.

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,640
Mother.

39
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,920
Bao and I are here to greet you.

40
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,960
This arm...

41
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,040
Father, Mother.

42
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,960
Please have some tea.

43
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,240
Che.

44
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,040
Thank you, Father.

45
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,400
Bao.

46
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,160
Here.

47
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,120
Thank you, Mother.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,240
By the way, Bao,

49
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,360
when is your birthday?

50
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,760
I let people remember.

51
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:49,600
Mother.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,880
I've made up my mind.

53
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,440
Since I married into the Lin family,

54
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm a member of the Lin family.

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,160
I'm a ghost of the Lin family.

56
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,520
My birthday...

57
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,040
Let's call it yesterday.

58
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,120
Your Highness.

59
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,000
Look how smart this new wife is.

60
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,880
Yes.

61
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,440
I've been reading the Analects lately.

62
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,000
I heard that you are well-versed in Confucius and Mencius.

63
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,240
and read a lot of books.

64
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,320
I admire you.

65
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,360
I have something I don't understand.

66
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,000
May I ask you something?

67
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,000
Sure.

68
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,840
The three armies can seize the commander.

69
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,920
A man cannot steal his ambition.

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What do you mean?

71
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,040
How would I know?

72
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,240
It sounds like a man.

73
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,840
Then let him take the blame.

74
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,720
Okay.

75
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,760
I can't tell you.

76
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,160
This sentence describes my husband.

77
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,160
His Highness is quite handsome.

78
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,920
Your wife has sharp eyes.

79
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,520
I can see that even if Che is ill,

80
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,120
he’s still ambitious.

81
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,200
You’re right.

82
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,040
Che does have

83
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,080
in making incense.

84
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,000
I know you're not Zhao Bao'er.

85
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,520
Thank you, God of Bandits.

86
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,159
God of Bandits is really a deity.

87
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,120
Don't be nervous.

88
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,440
I've asked the warehouse

89
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,400
the jewelry you stole.

90
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,760
Thank you.

91
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,960
I don't mean to offend you.

92
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
I'll leave tonight.

93
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,960
Please check the accounts.

94
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,680
I'll make it up for you.

95
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,800
No need. Just stay at home.

96
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,760
There are many refugees lately.

97
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,120
If you weren't desperate,

98
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,960
you wouldn't have gone this way.

99
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,000
I admire your generosity and foresight.

100
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,120
But I won't stay for long.

101
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,080
Thank you for your kindness.

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,840
You're welcome.

103
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,200
Actually, I have a favor to ask you today.

104
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,440
You flatter me.

105
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,840
I'm indebted to you.

106
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,040
How can I not help him?

107
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,840
Lin Che has been coveting my position for a long time.

108
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,720
I’m deeply surrounded.

109
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,040
Although he was weak and sick,

110
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,560
I still think he's pretending to be a pig and eating tiger.

111
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,040
I feel uneasy.

112
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,520
Can you keep an eye on him?

113
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,120
The third rule of the family.

114
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,159
you can't participate in court disputes.

115
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,280
I will do my best.

116
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,040
I chose Jo Bo-ah

117
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,400
because he and Lin Che are doomed to opposition.

118
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,720
and poor family.

119
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,080
and the Zhao family

120
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,440
can be used by us.

121
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,640
This wild girl doesn't seem to be easy to control.

122
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,280
Thank you for your tea, Your Highness.

123
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,040
Goodbye.

124
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,040
Since you don't trust me,

125
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,920
I won't beat around the bush.

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I poisoned the tea you just drank.

127
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,440
As long as you keep an eye on Lin Che.

128
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,840
and report our whereabouts,

129
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,640
I can give you an antidote every 15 days.

130
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,280
I guarantee you won't go crazy and laugh to death.

131
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,480
Despicable.

132
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,640
Shameless!

133
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
How dare

134
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,720
in the royal mansion.

135
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,680
Haha.

136
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,760
Your Highness.

137
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,280
I was joking.

138
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,240
There’s a deep gap

139
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,920
between Lin Che and me.

140
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,440
and a huge grudge.

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Even if His Highness doesn’t say it,

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,400
I won't stand against him.

143
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,120
Don’t panic, Your Highness.

144
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,560
I’ll keep an eye on Lin Che.

145
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,840
Thank you, heroine.

146
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,080
I'll kill him.

147
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,880
Not to mention there are masters in the mansion,

148
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,040
I've tried my trick twice.

149
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,960
No hair.

150
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,320
He's taller than me.

151
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,880
Oh.

152
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,640
Not tall.

153
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
Anyway, to get the antidote,

154
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,960
we have to use wisdom.

155
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,880
They give me the antidote every 15 days.

156
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,640
When they give me the antidote,

157
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,000
we will know where the antidote is.

158
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,320
By then...

159
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,120
Okay.

160
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,840
Before that,

161
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,960
we all need to be valued by the Lin family.

162
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,840
Yes.

163
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,560
One more thing.

164
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,000
Did Lin Che do anything to me

165
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,159
after he knocked me out.

166
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,880
I thought I was cunning enough.

167
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,360
But compared to them,

168
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,360
I'm just a sheep

169
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,000
and entered the King of Hell.

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,040
The King of Hell asked me how I died.

171
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,840
I had no idea.

172
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,920
According to my experience,

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,200
Lin Che is still a kid

174
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,720
He’s still a kid.

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,800
I know you best.

176
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,520
This is the first time for a man.

177
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,760
he wants to do it twice.

178
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,440
But if he hates you,

179
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,440
and doesn't like you,

180
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,040
he won't have a second time.

181
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,720
He will feel rejected.

182
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,400
What do you mean?

183
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,360
If he takes advantage of my sister,

184
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,440
he has to be responsible.

185
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,760
Who wants him to be responsible?

186
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,919
Stop arguing.

187
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,600
I have an idea.

188
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,160
to determine if he is a gentleman.

189
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,520
You pretended to be drunk

190
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,240
