1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Xiangshan He Shun Film Co., Ltd.

2
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,880
Although I'm weak and sick,

3
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,800
but it's my personal hobby.

4
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,320
But you know martial arts.

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,120
Father.

6
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,160
What you said is true.

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,080
One rice shop can solve the problem.

8
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,600
I'm all ears.

9
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,200
Can you make a bet with Bao?

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,360
Why do you want to bet?

11
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,600
This concerns the court.

12
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,800
You're a girl.

13
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,720
Don't talk nonsense.

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,360
I just want to contribute to the Lin family.

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,320
If we succeed,

16
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,480
can we ask His Highness for a wish?

17
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,680
As long as I can help His Majesty,

18
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,560
I have more than one wish.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Since you want to gamble,

20
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,400
I should keep a sense of mystery.

21
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,200
Father, I don't think it's appropriate.

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,280
It concerns the dignity of the royal family.

23
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,320
Bao'er is a woman.

24
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,000
She didn't go to the court.

25
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,000
I didn't know that the court was in turmoil.

26
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,200
It's dangerous.

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,840
If something happens,

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,880
will you take the responsibility?

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,080
Yes.

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:36,800
Okay.

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,680
I accept the bet.

32
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,400
Please.

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,520
There are bandits who learn from each other.

34
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,880
and learn from each other.

35
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,280
At that moment, I thought

36
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,880
this is the man who protected me.

37
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,280
Stop talking nonsense.

38
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,960
Tell me.

39
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,880
What do you want a rice shop for?

40
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,240
Move the money to the government.

41
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,520
and fight against poison with poison.

42
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,680
Be specific.

43
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,920
I used to...

44
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,759
It's hard to explain.

45
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,560
Just leave it to me.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,840
Thank you for your words.

47
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,000
for giving up your life for me.

48
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,079
Thank you.

49
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,079
How are you going to thank me?

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,440
A drop of water should be repaid with a spring.

51
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,040
How do you want me to thank you?

52
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,680
I think it's simple.

53
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:37,880
You

54
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,079
spend the night with me.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,800
Ah.

56
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,000
No way

57
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,040
Again?

58
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,760
Have you found out what you asked?

59
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,240
Is it as I thought?

60
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,680
Bao’er

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,920
She did hire a group of robbers.

62
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,680
But she didn't do it for you.

63
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,000
but to act.

64
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,160
It was someone else.

65
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,800
switched the robbers to a servant who killed you.

66
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,840
As expected,

67
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,160
she was used by Lin Feng.

68
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:24,960
Ziye.

69
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,720
Maybe Zhao Bao'er can be used by us.

70
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,000
But Young Master,

71
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,760
you've exposed your kung fu skills to save her.

72
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,160
I don't want to see your long-planned plan

73
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,840
to be ruined by her.

74
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,920
Maybe

75
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,480
I can make her tell the truth.

76
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,960
You're awake.

77
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,960
Let me tell you first.

78
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,800
There is silicone powder in the wax oil.

79
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,280
It's highly poisonous.

80
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,080
Ye and I have taken the antidote in advance.

81
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,240
So it's fine.

82
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,440
The less you talk,

83
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,839
the longer you live,

84
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,920
Understood.

85
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,079
Ye.

86
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,760
Lin Che, this is the second time you drugged me.

87
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,840
And you are strong.

88
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,680
and strong.

89
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,200
Why do you always pretend to be weak?

90
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,800
How dare you say that?

91
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,840
If it wasn't for saving you,

92
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,200
I would have exposed my martial arts.

93
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:41,960
Yes.

94
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,080
You're guilty of catching me.

95
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,440
Ye.

96
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,120
It's double poison now.

97
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,360
I said

98
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,880
A piece of crap.

99
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,280
What do you want me to say?

100
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,640
Why did you take the credit?

101
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,280
His Highness is the Supreme Lord.

102
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,680
It's normal for me to please him.

103
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,600
If my wish is fulfilled,

104
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,600
it'll be gold and silver.

105
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,280
and a great fortune.

106
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,560
I'm just a weak woman.

107
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,280
I just want to live.

108
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,080
Cut the crap. I know who you work for.

109
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,960
Let's make a deal.

110
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,440
She wants to make a deal with me.

111
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,080
I don't think you know what's going on.

112
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,840
You're in no position to negotiate with me.

113
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,880
My people are still in the mansion.

114
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,680
Even if I die,

115
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,200
someone will still tell Lin Feng

116
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,840
you're pretending to be a pig and eating a tiger.

117
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,840
Actually, I had no choice.

118
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,920
I was poisoned by Lin Feng.

119
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,280
Many things are not what I want.

120
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,840
As long as you are willing to detoxify me,

121
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,240
I'll do whatever you want.

122
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,960
I'm willing to do anything.

123
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,480
How do I know this is not a trick?

124
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,400
I haven't settled with you

125
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,880
I haven't got even with you yet.

126
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,120
I don't have time to waste.

127
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,800
I'll give you three days.

128
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,159
If I don't have an answer within three days,

129
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,720
it's up to you.

130
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,800
Female motto.

131
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,880
The Classic of Filial Daughter.

132
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,080
Why isn't there a male virtue motto?

133
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,160
It seems that we chivalry women have higher status.

134
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,920
Physics.

135
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,520
Is it comfortable?

136
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,560
It's uncomfortable, right?

137
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,480
Are you going to the toilet?

138
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,000
Because you're thirsty.

139
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,800
You need water.

140
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,040
So you're going to the toilet?

141
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,240
Hey.

142
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,360
even if you're thirsty,

143
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,600
you don't need to go to the toilet.

144
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,080
I have

145
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,480
I have food

146
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,600
and drinks.

147
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,240
What about you?

148
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,360
Just drink whatever you want.

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,280
Oh, right.

150
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,760
Your mouth is sealed.

151
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,080
I don't think you can drink it.

152
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,880
But it's okay.

153
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,600
I'll drink it for you.

154
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,440
to receive people with a letter.

155
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,000
The world believes

156
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,640
[If you don't believe in people,]

157
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,160
My wife is suspicious.

158
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,960
Oh no, Miss Rou loves this book so much.

159
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,200
she must have acknowledged these principles.

160
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,559
If she knows my real identity,

161
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,080
and knows I lied to her,

162
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,440
Fool.

163
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,440
Miss Rou.

164
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,440
Why are you here?

165
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,960
What are you looking at?

166
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,680
Nothing.

167
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,680
Male virtue.

168
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,000
It teaches a man to obey a woman with three obediences and four virtues.

169
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,840
A man should obey three obediences and four virtues of a woman.

170
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,600
Yes.

171
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,160
Why haven't I seen

172
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,880
Which three, which four virtues?

173
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,240
Exactly.

174
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,480
I'm not married yet.

176
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,760
A wife dies from a daughter.

177
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,880

I made such a rule today.

185
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,080
and I will follow it.

186

I’m just not as famous as Ban Zhao.

187
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,840
Otherwise, I'll write a book

188
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,640
and let all men obey it.

189
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
Fool. Yes.

190
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,360
Even if you wrote it,

191
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,000
no one will obey.

192
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,600
Why?

193
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,080

194
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,000
Why do they recommend it?

195
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,200
You're indeed a princess.

196
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,480
You're right to the point.

197
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,800
You're amazing.

198
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,240
Fool.

199

201
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,280

202
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,040
will you blame me?

203

I don’t want you to suffer if I find out.

206
