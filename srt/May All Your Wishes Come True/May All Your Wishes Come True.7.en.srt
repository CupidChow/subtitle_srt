1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Xiangshan He Shun Film Co., Ltd.

2
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,920
Let me do it.

3
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,960
Let me.

4
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,560
Honey, have some soup.

5
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,960
Honey, have some lotus roots.

6
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,720
My husband doesn't eat lotus root.

7
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,240
Have you heard of the ghost market?

8
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,800
It's called the dark market.

9
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,039
You know that place?

10
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,759
They said it's in West Street.

11
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,039
in West Street.

12
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,000
It's crowded at midnight.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,200
Lights are clear

14
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,400
and disappeared at midnight.

15
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,160
It's just some merchants trying to avoid the local rent.

16
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,600
Most of the deals there are dirty.

17
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,320
It's a good name to call it Ghost Market.

18
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,440
Sounds interesting.

19
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,600
Can you show me around?

20
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,720
No.

21
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,520
Why do you get involved with that evil aura?

22
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,520
Let's eat.

23
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,560
Let's eat.

24
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,720
If you make a wish, I’ll give you three more days.

25
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,120
If Lin Che doesn’t love you,

26
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,520
I’ll let you be together.

27
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,760
Since I married you,

28
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,200
since I married you.

29
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,400
My husband has always been a gentleman.

30
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,920
and considerate.

31
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,040
I only have this little request.

32
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,880
You will agree.

33
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,960
Right?

34
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Get me another bowl of soup.

35
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,600
Okay.

36
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,120
No.

37
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,079
You...

38
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,400
Drink it or not.

39
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,720
You said you wouldn't come,

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,520
but your body is very honest.

41
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,560
Women who can act cute are the best.

42
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,360
Ziye said

43
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,200
my mother's butterfly hairpin appeared in the ghost market.

44
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,360
Is it a coincidence or...

45
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,360
Have a look.

46
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,600
Mother's belongings.

47
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,399
It's really here.

48
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,760
Is this hairpin beautiful?

49
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,600
Very vulgar.

50
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,480
My wife is beautiful.

51
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,800
It looks better with this hairpin.

52
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,040
As the saying goes,

53
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,560
The blossom is green and the clouds are slippery.

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,680
Po-chai falls down with green hair.

55
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,159
Rou.

56
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,960
Is your sister-in-law beautiful?

57
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,600
I didn't know

58
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,280
you could be so beautiful?

59
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,360
You can't make a wish.

60
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,160
You're so indecisive.

61
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,960
Beauty.

62
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,960
But he called me Beauty.

63
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,880
Do you like it?

64
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,200
No.

65
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,920
Suzhen,

66
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,000
Actually, I prefer this hairpin.

67
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,360
You know

68
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,320
I've always liked to make spices.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,800
There's a strange fragrance on this hairpin.

70
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,040
I want to buy it and study it.

71
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,880
As a man,

72
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,920
as a man.

73
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,640
It's nothing.

74
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,720
I understand.

75
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,080
Respect and love.

76
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,720
Leave it to me. Don't worry.

77
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,960
There's a leaf on this hairpin. I don't like it.

78
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,760
How much is it?

79
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,320
Ten taels.

80
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,600
So expensive?

81
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,400
7 taels.

82
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,920
Nine taels is not less than one tael.

83
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,360
There was no bargain.

84
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,040
At midnight,

85
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,880
The weather is dry.

86
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,600
Beware of fire.

87
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,120
At midnight,

88
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,960
The weather is dry.

89
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,680
Watch out for the fire.

90
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,720
Little Witch.

91
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,280
Little Witch.

92
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,800
Why isn't she back yet?

93
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,080
Little Witch.

94
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,600
Little Witch.

95
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,520
You're the best.

96
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,760
If you want to bring me delicious food from the ghost market,

97
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,159
What food?

98
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,360
in our mansion.

99
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,800
You don't know?

100
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,320
When the chicken hatches,

101
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,320
You can eat it before it's formed.

102
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,080
Your hairpin is not pure gold.

103
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,160
It's mixed with impurity.

104
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,800
The Marble is nice.

105
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,400
Unfortunately,

106
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,560
there was a large amount of high-quality ice seed in Yongzhou last month.

107
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,400
I'm afraid the glutinous seeds are not easy to sell.

108
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,080
It's only worth five taels in Yongzhou.

109
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,360
You can sell it in the Western State.

110
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,160
and reduce the travel expenses.

111
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,120
I'll calculate seven taels for you.

112
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,920
So what if I sell it next month?

113
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,200
There is no place to rent in the dark market.

114
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,880
But the glutinous seeds will be reduced next month.

115
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,720
I'll buy it next month when it's down to six taels.

116
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,040
Miss.

117
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,440
Miss.

118
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,800
You're right.

119
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,159
In that case,

120
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,680
Seven taels.

121
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,400
It's okay to sell it to an expert.

122
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,000
You're amazing.

123
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,040
Sir,

124
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,800
My wife likes this hairpin very much.

125
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,200
Can you introduce the hairpin seller?

126
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,120
I'm afraid we can't do that.

127
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,280
After all, the secret market is doing an underground deal.

128
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,000
Why isn't he here yet?

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,120
Please forgive me.

130
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,080
Hi.

131
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,000
Come here.

132
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,080
Come here.

133
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,720
Five more taels after it's done.

134
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,679
This...

135
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,760
On the 15th of this month,

136
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,360
at Zuixian Pavilion.

137
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,960
In that case,

138
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,880
Thank you.

139
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,440
The flowers can't bloom too well.

140
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,000
If it blooms too much,

141
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,280
it'll be too dazzling among the flowers.

142
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,640
For everyone's sake,

143
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,400
someone will pinch their heads.

144
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,920
Mother.

145
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,520
Is everything done?

146
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,880
This fake Jo Bo-ah

147
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,320
will be the scapegoat who killed Lin Che.

148
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,720
However,

149
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,800
Rou will be with us tonight.

150
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,720
I've ordered the assassins

151
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,200
not to hurt Rou.

152
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,200
I'm afraid this sword will be blind.

153
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,000
Why do you want to see this hairpin seller?

154
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,800
I'm going to ask him to make another one for me.

155
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,520
Seriously.

156
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,400
You paid back

157
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
was returned by you.

158
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,000
Do I look like I'm short of money?

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,280
You noblemen are so extravagant.

160
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,600
You don't know the suffering of the mortal world.

161
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,080
Mother told me

162
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,720
the Zhao family in the Western State is very poor.

163
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,880
Sister-in-law, you must have suffered a lot since you were young.

164
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,800
Now that you're married, you should enjoy your life.

165
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,160
Brother, you must treat your sister-in-law well.

166
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,720
Rou, you don't understand.

167
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,720
Not all women

168
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,320
need protection.

169
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,600
By the way,

170
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,240
you're good at business.

171
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,000
I've always been

172
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,200
Baby.

173
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm not interested.

174
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,840
My mother knows a lot about it.

175
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,000
She taught me everything.

176
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,120
Let’s go.

177
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:40,760
Lin Che, Meng En.

178
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,080
Xu Zi Yin made a wish.

179
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,440
Xu Zi Yin.

180
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,720
Wen Youcai, Han Haotian.

181
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:41,920
Lin Rou Yi, Chen Chuqi.

182
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,240
Lin Rou Yi, Chen Chuqi.

183
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,680
Lin Feng Yi, Jin Wangwang.

184
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:42,960
Lin Feng Yi, Jin Wangwang.

185
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,360
Lin Yan and Yang Jun.

186
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:43,720
Lucky Du, Tan Yinmin.

187
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,000
Lucky Du, Tan Yinmin.

188
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,240
Qian Youfu Yi, Guo Chang.

189
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,560
Qian Youfu Yi, Guo Chang.

190
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:44,960
