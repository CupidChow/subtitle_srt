1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Xiangshan He Shun Film Co., Ltd.

2
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,080
I'm popular.

3
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,560
Honey, I know what you like.

4
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,800
I saw it that day.

5
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,480
This...

6
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,560
Come on.

7
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:49,880
Come on.

8
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,920
Tie me up.

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,120
I can't wait.

10
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,960
You're a noble lady.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,200
How can you be so frivolous?

12
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,680
You like this?

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,480
Really?

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,319
Then go play by yourself.

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,120
You said he has fallen in love with you.

16
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,360
What evidence do you have?

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,360
He...

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,600
He blushes when he sees me.

19
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,880
Why are you blushing?

20
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,200
In your eyes,

21
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,160
He thinks I'm special.

22
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,560
I'm different from ordinary women.

23
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,560
He even kissed me.

24
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,720
Did he protect you?

25
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,920
No.

26
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,199
Make a wish and I’ll give you three more days.

27
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,600
If Lin Che doesn’t love you,

28
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,080
I’ll let you be together.

29
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,520
He has never experienced love.

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,200
He has feelings for you.

31
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,600
No need.

32
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,320
I won't force you.

33
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,040
How about this?

34
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,960
I'll ask him to go to the dark market tomorrow

35
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,079
to assassinate him.

36
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,720
I took the chance to play a trick to save the hero.

37
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,760
That day,

38
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,000
a weak young master

39
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,160
met a heroine who saved him with his life.

40
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,760
who saved him with his life.

41
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,760
gentle and beautiful.

42
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,680
save him at the critical moment.

43
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,680
to fulfill all his fantasies about his lover.

44
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,440
I don't believe we can't beat him.

45
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,720
Uh.

46
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,120
This...

47
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,560
That's great.

48
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,040
I look forward to your good news.

49
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,520
Really?

50
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,520
Very suitable.

51
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,400
Really?

52
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,480
Don't say that.

53
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,240
It's because you're born pretty.

54
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,240
What?

55
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,840
You're so eloquent.

56
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,480
Your hairstyle

57
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,200
It doesn't look good.

58
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,600
I'll comb it for you next time.

59
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,240
Okay.

60
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,480
Then we have a deal.

61
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,760
What are you doing?

62
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,640
Really?

63
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,760
Of course.

64
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,440
This knife is fast.

65
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,079
Why sharpen it?

66
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,320
I'm going to kill these adulterers.

67
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,079
I won't see you off then.

68
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:49,960
I'll come again.

69
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,040
Okay.

70
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,560
Goodbye.

71
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,160
Are you tired?

72
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,240
Let's take a seat.

73
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,959
Have a seat.

74
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,480
Why are you holding a knife?

75
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,360
I want to kill a chicken for you tonight.

76
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,280
Have a seat.

77
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,160
Mother.

78
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,640
Pour some tea.

79
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,680
Okay.

80
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,680
All right.

81
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,480
Hey, girl.

82
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,159
Why were you looking for me?

83
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,480
Oh.

84
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,880
By the way, dad,

85
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,040
I found out something happened to Lin Yan a few days ago.

86
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,360
Hello, Mrs Liang.

87
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,080
You scared me.

88
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,159
What is this?

89
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,159
Jigong's sole pancake.

90
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,640
I don't know where my mother fell in love with it.

91
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,600
I tried it.

92
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,159
The taste is amazing.

93
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,000
Princess Zhao loves this pastry very much.

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,880
She can't help herself.

95
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,600
I want two hawthorns.

96
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,040
Mother.

97
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,000
What are you doing?

98
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,280
I'm making

99
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,600
Jigong's sole pancake

100
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,360
The pancakes stepped out

101
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,160
and roast it on fire.

102
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,720
It's crispy fragrance.

103
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,800
This shoe pancake...

104
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,320
can be widely spread among refugees and beggars.

105
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,080
which means its taste is unique.

106
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,360
Princess Zhao is used to delicacies.

107
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,000
Sometimes she would want to pick wild flowers on the street.

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,200
Yeah

109
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,280
More importantly,

110
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,080
the shoe pancake contains a lot of fruit in the mountains.

111
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,440
It's good for your stomach.

112
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,480
I found out a few days ago

113
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,480
Princess Zhao is suffering from constipation.

114
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,280
Girl,

115
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,480
The trick you taught me works well.

116
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,240
Now Princess Zhao

117
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,920
my shoes pastries.

118
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,200
I want to stand

119
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,120
I want to sit.

120
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,960
Your mother is really good at cooking.

121
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,320
Right, honey?

122
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,920
Princess Zhao is tired of the food in the mansion.

123
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,000
She always wants something fresh.

124
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,400
and forced Master Zhao to study new recipes.

125
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,240
So I gave her some advice.

126
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,560
I didn't expect Princess Zhao to like it.

127
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,160
I love it too.

128
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,280
Daughter, I'll listen to you.

129
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,760
No matter how much Master Zhao begged me,

130
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,280
I won't make shoe soles anymore unless

131
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,080
he recommended me to Princess Zhao.

132
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,600
Did he?

133
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,760
No.

134
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,480
It's okay.

135
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,880
He'll come back in a few days.

136
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,280
When he comes again,

137
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,960
when Princess Zhao wants to eat it till she can't.

138
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,120
This is called what can't be eaten is always the best.

139
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,880
Forget it.

140
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
One more thing.

141
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,080
Give it back if you don't want it.

142
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,080
You don't understand. If you were me,

143
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,280
if you were me.

144
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,560
Yes.

145
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,120
I love stories.

146
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,200
No.

147
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,080
There's no story.

148
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,960
Don't mind her.

149
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,440
I just love telling stories.

150
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
and listen to stories.

151
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,800
He likes stories.

152
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,800
That's easy.

153
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,040
Daughter, let me tell you.

154
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,280
When I was young,

155
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,040
What about all kinds of love and hatred?

156
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,960
is...

157
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:43,880
Yes.

158
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,600
More salt than he eats.

159
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,800
Okay, try it.

160
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:47,760
Try it.

161
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,280
Youcai.

162
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,240
I haven't seen him for days.

163
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,880
Where did he go?

164
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,880
I guess

165
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,320
she must have been abducted by someone's daughter.

166
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,400
That's good.

167
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,160
I think there's a new mark

168
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,800
left us a new mark every day.

169
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,720
Are you trying to scare me?

170
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,120
Lin Che, Meng En.

171
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,480
Xu Zi Yin made a wish.

172
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,120
Wen Youcai, Han Haotian.

173
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,400
Lin Rou, Chen Chuqi.

174
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:52,760
Lin Rou. Chen Chuqi.

175
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,080
Lin Feng Yi, Jin Wangwang.

176
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:53,760
