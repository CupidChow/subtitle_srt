1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Xiangshan He Shun Film Co., Ltd.

2
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,240
By the order of the emperor,

3
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,080
According to the decree,

4
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,640
Lin Che, son of Lin Daosheng,

5
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,960
Be kind.

6
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,160
Open the granary and give out food.

7
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,960
and set an example for the royal family.

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,760
to make peace with Yongzhou's grain price

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,480
to show the virtue of the royal family.

10
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,400
and show the prestige of the royal family.

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,600
I hereby appoint Lin Dao

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,360
the second rank prince.

13
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,320
They’ve all been promoted.

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,360
Lin Che is the Vice Minister of Revenue.

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,520
Respect this.

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,440
Thank you, Your Majesty.

18
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,200
What are you doing? Open it.

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,960
Princess, we have no choice.

20
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,479
Why are you putting me under house arrest?

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,600
Your Highness, I heard that you've been close to Guard Wen recently.

22
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,240
She asked you to reflect on yourself.

23
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,479
I'm a princess.

24
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,400
Who are you to tell me who I'm dating?

25
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,720
Congratulations on your promotion.

26
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,160
Congratulations.

27
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,000
The official is not high.

28
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,360
As long as you can get promoted.

29
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,760
Money doesn't matter.

30
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,120
As long as it can rise.

31
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,960
Let's congratulate Vice Minister Lin.

32
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,760
Congratulations, Vice Minister Lin.

33
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,560
Congratulations.

34
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,920
A pot of wine brings us together.

35
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,720
Many things in the past

36
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,360
in the ancient times.

37
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,760
Here, let me propose another toast.

38
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,320
Cheers.

39
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,240
What are you waiting for?

40
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,120
Let's eat. It's a family dinner today.

41
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,000
Don't be shy.

42
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,920
Let go!

43
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,920
It's such a big day.

44
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,480
Rou still doesn't want to attend?

45
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,240
Father.

46
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,440
Rou caught a cold a few days ago.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,520
Mother and I have visited her today.

48
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,320
She's fine.

49
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,840
I think I look haggard

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,960
and doesn't want to see anyone.

51
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,280
Rou has 800 reasons not to see anyone.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,800
She loves drawing.

53
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
A few days ago,

54
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,920
Rou is getting better.

55
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,840
She even wants to go out and play.

56
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,600
Why is he not here today?

57
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,400
Maybe he's sick again.

58
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,400
It's all my fault.

59
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
I don't know.

60
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,320
Did I spoil her too much

61
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,920
or too careless?

62
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,560
Rou

63
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,240
doesn't talk much.

64
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,440
She always lives in her own world.

65
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,880
Do you think I'm too indecisive

66
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,320
and too weak?

67
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,040
I'm not a good mother.

68
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,240
You're so patient with Rou.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,760
The doctor said Rou's illness was brought by the mother.

70
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,079
It's all my fault.

71
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,440
When you were pregnant with Rou,

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,600
I always neglected you.

73
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,560
and misunderstood you.

74
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,280
and made you depressed.

75
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,360
Rou became autistic.

76
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,440
and doesn't like to see people.

77
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,120
It's none of your business.

78
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,760
It's all my fault.

79
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,960
Put the fetus first.

80
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,600
Mother.

81
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,280
How did you feel when you gave birth to me?

82
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,120
How did it feel to have a brother?

83
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,760
Why am I so rough and thick-skinned?

84
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,440
You're smart.

85
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,800
His Highness treats me well.

86
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,320
How would I know why you two are different?

87
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,960
I heard that if you're exhausted when you're pregnant,

88
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
If you worry too much,

89
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,280
the baby will be calm and worried.

90
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,520
If you feel relaxed,

91
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,720
when they feel relaxed,

92
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,680
the child born will be carefree.

93
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,600
Be optimistic.

94
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,960
I’m curious.

95
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,520
I don't know why you are so worried.

96
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,200
Don't listen to hearsay.

97
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,720
and believe these nonsense.

98
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,960
Bao.

99
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,360
How do you feel

100
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,240
in the palace today?

101
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,600
I heard His Majesty praised you for your intelligence.

102
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,640
A talented woman from Jiangnan.

103
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,520
Is that true?

104
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,360
Che is smart.

105
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,840
He proposed to His Majesty

106
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,159
to promote Daxing Civil Engineering

107
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,960
to encourage rich businessmen to build more houses.

108
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,320
to summon the abbots of all temples in Yongzhou.

109
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,800
Since there are many workers in the famine,

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,960
the price is cheap.

111
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,320
Please repair the temple.

112
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,320
In this way,

113
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
the refugees can earn their own food.

114
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,840
As the saying goes,

115
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,800
When His Majesty heard it,

116
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,760
he will be very happy.

117
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,960
I have to promote him.

118
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,320
That’s right.

119
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,320
Che is always smart.

120
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,680
You’re a good teacher.

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,320
As for me, I'm timid.

122
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,480
When I saw His Majesty,

123
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,680
he was so scared that he couldn't speak.

124
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,320
When he opened his mouth,

125
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,680
when he opens his mouth.

126
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,000
so that we can talk.

127
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,720
It's just that I have lingering fear.

128
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,520
I lied to His Majesty.

129
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,280
Ridiculous!

130
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,600
How can you lie to His Majesty?

131
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,600
His Majesty asked us to record

132
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,040
the list of officials who participated in high price selling grain.

133
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,080
I deliberately hid it from the Zhao family.

134
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,720
Father.

135
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,120
This ledger

136
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,200
recorded the improper trade between the Zhao family and several rice shops.

137
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,840
The most notorious Soren Rice Shop

138
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,800
The country is a rice shop.

139
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,400
Their mastermind is the Zhao family.

140
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,000
Look at what your family did.

141
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,200
I have no idea

142
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,960
I know nothing, Your Highness.

143
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,000
I always pity those refugees.

144
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,320
Every spring,

145
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,760
every spring.

146
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,600
to send them rice and cotton blankets.

147
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,200
You know that too.

148
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,440
How could I earn money from the refugees?

149
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,480
This is more than

150
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,880
than the money.

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,680
How could Princess Zhao not know?

152
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,040
conservative sects and main battles.

153
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,280
Their disputes are on fire.

154
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,000
The royal mansion is taking care of all the connections in the court.

155
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,440
and the mansion has no income.

156
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,440
All I can do is ask for allowance from my family.

157
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,560
and promised them one by one.

158
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,400
That's how I maintained the expenses of this mansion.

159
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,200
Who would have thought my mother's money would come from this?

160
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:52,920
You...

161
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,440
Are you stupid?

162
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,120
Not all money can be used.

163
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,159
to use anything.

164
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,000
Father,

165
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,120
We need to give His Majesty an explanation.

166
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,360
Don't lie to His Majesty.

167
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,720
or implicate the mansion.

168
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,560
Let the Zhao brothers explain themselves.

169
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,160
Your Highness.

170
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,920
Your Highness.

171
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,280
I will plead with His Majesty.

172
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,400
It's not against the law

173
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,080
is not against the law.

174
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,600
or severe punishment.

175
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,280
Just stay at home and don't go out.

176
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,400
You can't show up in public anymore.

177
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
What are you doing?

178
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,920
The family is celebrating.

179
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,600
You're in mourning.

180
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,840
I want to live a few more years.

181
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,880
Father,

182
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,120
Do you remember

183
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,520
Today is mother's death anniversary.

184
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,240
You have no right to decide on this family.

185
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,080
Put this away.

186
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,520
Sister.

187
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,760
Do you still resent me for revealing you?

188
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,240
I hope you can turn over a new leaf.

189
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,520
I don't want to see you again.

190
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,880
What are you doing?

191
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,000
This is ridiculous.

192
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,920
Since ancient times,

193
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,400
I've never heard of it.

194
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,920
A murderer deserves a toast to the dead.

195
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,560
What murderer?

196
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,600
Che, what are you talking about?

197
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,440
All these years,

198
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,200
if you hadn't mentioned it to my father,

199
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,880
in front of my father,

200
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,800
The whole mansion

201
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,480
can still be

202
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,280
as others see.

203
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,880
Everyone is happy.

204
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,840
But you have to disgust me with this.

205
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,960
Don't blame me for bringing up what happened back then.

206
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,200
Your mother did something dirty.

207
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,360
No wonder someone exposed her.

208
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,320
What do you mean?

209
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,520
Princess Zhao.

210
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,400
Do you remember who drugged my mother?

211
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,840
and sent her into the Dai family’s room?

212
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,520
Che, I know you hate me.

213
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,160
I shouldn’t expose your mother to Prince.

214
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,440
But I can't simply

215
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,680
shouldn't be put on people's heads.

216
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,360
Am I more wronged than Dou E?

217
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,360
Your mother was drugged.

218
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,360
When did this happen?

219
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,160
Do you have evidence?

220
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,080
You want evidence?

221
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,120
Okay.

222
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,200
