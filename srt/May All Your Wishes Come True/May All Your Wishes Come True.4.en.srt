1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Xiangshan He Shun Film Co., Ltd.

2
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,520
This way.

3
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,280
Hurry!

4
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,040
The assassin is there.

5
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,520
Princess.

6
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,760
An assassin broke in.

7
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,880
and ran to your room.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,920
I’m worried about your safety.

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,760
so I came to check.

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,400
Princess, are you alright?

11
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,040
Keep quiet.

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,560
Princess, if you don't say anything,

13
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,560
I'm going in.

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,480
I just saw a solo movie going to the backyard.

15
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,200
Let's go.

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,360
You're injured.

17
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,039
I have a special ointment.

18
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,240
Let me bandage your wound.

19
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,600
Do you think I'm stupid?

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,160
If you don't bandage your wound,

21
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,960
you'll die first.

22
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,520
I'll apply medicine for you.

23
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,920
I forgot to put chili powder in this medicine.

24
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,840
This snake

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,120
is called step smile.

26
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,320
You'll get poisoned if it bites you.

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,560
and die laughing.

28
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,160
So tell me the truth.

29
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,400
or I'll put it in the cabinet.

30
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,759
Heroine.

31
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,919
Please spare my life.

32
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,440
I've been afraid of snakes since I was young.

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,160
I'll tell you.

34
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,880
Okay.

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
What's your name?

36
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,240
My name is Wen Youcai.

37
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,320
Wen Youcai.

38
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,320
May I know your name?

39
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,000
I...

40
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,640
Why should I tell you?

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,079
Heroine.

42
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,240
I went to hell.

43
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,520
the king of hell asked me how I died.

44
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,160
I can give him an explanation.

45
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,800
Take it away.

46
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,640
Okay.

47
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,520
Please.

48
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,520
My name is Lin Rou.

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,680
Why are you here?

50
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,079
I...

51
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,440
Steal.

52
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:42,960
Steal?

53
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,720
I have no money.

54
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,320
I haven't eaten for days.

55
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,560
I'm starving.

56
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,079
How is it going?

57
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,520
I found it.

58
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,480
The Zhao family from the Western State

59
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,800
is the list of private salt informants.

60
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,160
Zhao Bao’er doesn’t have it.

61
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,000
Since Zhao Bao'er has a problem,

62
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,720
sooner or later, the Zhao family will take care of her.

63
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,920
Let's wait and see.

64
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,400
Yes.

65
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,040
What do you think of your young master?

66
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,040
Of course.

67
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,760
The women who want to pounce on you

68
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,840
can line up from Yongzhou to the Western State.

69
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,880
If I were a woman,

70
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,680
you are nothing.

71
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,960
But Zhao Bao'er...

72
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,280
She asked me to go back and look at the bronze mirror.

73
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,760
She said I look average.

74
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,640
What kind of face is this?

75
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,040
like a star in the sky.

76
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,560
Young Master, we can't be influenced by her.

77
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,640
How could I be affected by her?

78
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,000
By the way,

79
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,200
Recently, after the God of Bandits opened the granary,

80
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
has increased the interest.

81
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,600
The people's suffering won't decrease.

82
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,960
Okay, I got it.

83
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,280
Please come in.

84
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,760
Sir.

85
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,960
What brings you here?

86
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,320
Sir.

87
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,840
We can't simply enter the room upstairs.

88
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,000
I want that room.

89
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,840
This is our new

90
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,640
the new Oiran.

91
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,120
has been taken away by other customers.

92
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,400
Ah

93
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,680
Bulyu

94
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,960
Welcome the guests.

95
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,560
Sir.

96
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,360
Sir.

97
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,560
You're so bad.

98
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,240
I like it so much.

99
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,159
Sir, look at me.

100
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,080
It's so dark.

101
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,000
Kiss me.

102
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,600
I hate this.

103
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,159
Come on.

104
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,680
I've given you enough money.

105
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,480
Come on.

106
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,080
Kiss me.

107
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,159
What are you doing?

108
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,360
You should...

109
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,040
Forget it.

110
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,840
I know nothing.

111
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,640
I'm so worried if we kiss or not.

112
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
Are you crazy?

113
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,160
Sir, you tied him so tightly.

114
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,840
I love it.

115
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,960
I can't move the willow.

116
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,320
Sir.

117
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,560
Excuse me.

118
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,640
Go on.

119
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,920
You're so bad.

120
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,040
What's your name?

121
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,480
Are you new here?

122
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,000
Young Master.

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,400
The remaining 2,000 taels of Pu Yue

124
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,640
The lotus moon is 2100 taels.

125
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,800
After the refugees of Qingzhou flooded into Yongzhou,

126
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,160
The moon can gain 5,000 taels.

127
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,120
Meng,

128
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,040
How about this?

129
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,960
the people won't receive any interest within three months.

130
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,000
You only charge interest for three months.

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,640
You'll get the principal in the last month.

132
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,640
No, Young Master.

133
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,000
Jiuji can’t bear such a loss.

134
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,240
Maybe I’m narrow-minded.

135
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,640
You've been a business genius since childhood.

136
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:53,159
I'm afraid this is a new strategy.

137
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:54,960
Maybe.

138
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,520
He actually likes this.

139
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,800
The day before yesterday,

140
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,200
and sleep with fragrance.

141
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,000
Yesterday, I ate and slept.

142
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,120
and made a wish, you're replaying the letter for me.

143
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,320
There's more in the back.

144
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm going to the brothel for dinner today.

145
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,799
Going to brothels?

146
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,640
Yes.

147
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,799
Let me tell you.

148
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,760
His hobby is

149
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,440
Amazing.

150
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,240
He can't go to a brothel.

151
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,679
He's deceiving people.

152
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,039
making a wish.

153
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,040
You're still not close to me.

154
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,040
These are all deceptive tricks.

155
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,280
Make a wish.

156
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,320
I don't have much patience.

157
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,840
The poison will take effect soon.

158
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,640
You’d better make Lin Che trust you.

159
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,920
and fall in love with you.

160
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,680
Find out his real whereabouts.

161
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,480
Okay.

162
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,800
Mother.

163
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,360
I have a friend.

164
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,160
Yes.

165
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,320
She wants a man to fall in love with her.

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,240
What should she do?

167
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,360
Friend?

168
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,080
Which friend?

169
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,360
What friend?

170
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,280
I think it's you.

171
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,400
No.

172
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,640
It's really a friend of mine.

173
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,640
Daughter,

174
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,560
Do you have a crush on Lin Che?

175
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,680
No.

176
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,600
