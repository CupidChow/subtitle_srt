1
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,780
Haa...

2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,520
Haa...

3
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,380
Senpai, this feels great!

4
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,010
Ow, that's hot...

5
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,890
Senpai, your turn for the shower.

6
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,070
How did this happen?

7
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,610
How did this really happen?

8
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,730
A business trip?

9
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:00,950
Yeah.

10
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,858
It's a project I've been working on

11
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,305
with Hiroko since last year,

12
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,546
but I can't make it this time

13
00:01:05,554 --> 00:01:07,085
because of another engagement.

14
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:08,750
Can you go instead?

15
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,290
A business trip

16
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,740
with Hiroko-senpai? Just the two of us?

17
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,040
Yeah, it's an overnight trip,

18
00:01:14,292 --> 00:01:15,368
but it will be

19
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:16,860
a great learning experience.

20
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,000
I'll do my best!

21
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,030
I'll pour my entire soul into this!

22
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,030
You don't have to go that far...

23
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,820
Then, I'll excuse myself.

24
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,002
A battle I cannot afford to lose

25
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:34,307
is starting now!

26
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,290
"AYAKA is in LOVE with HIROKO"

27
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,555
"Episode 3"
"A double bed with a straight"

28
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,446
This one or this one? Which one
do you think I should take on the trip?

29
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,500
Which one?

30
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,160
I think this one is ravishing.

31
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,622
But to abandon this
prim and proper one is...

32
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,180
Umm...

33
00:02:36,971 --> 00:02:38,158
By the way, why are you

34
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:39,534
choosing underwear?

35
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:42,995
Because it's my first business
trip with Hiroko-senpai!

36
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,690
If there's a problem with

37
00:02:44,715 --> 00:02:46,605
Hiroko-senpai's work because of me,

38
00:02:46,628 --> 00:02:47,956
that would be terrible.

39
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,816
So I have to wear
auspicious underwear.

40
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,530
For good luck, huh?

41
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,920
Yes.

42
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,710
Why are you laughing?

43
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,270
No, it's just so you, Ayaka.

44
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,090
Huh?

45
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,680
You're always so honest.

46
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,420
I suppose.

47
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,765
If it's for good luck,

48
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:12,741
I'd go with the prim and proper one.

49
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,720
Right?

50
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,690
I was leaning towards that one too!

51
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,160
- Okay, I'll take this one!
- Yeah.

52
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,420
Alright.

53
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,485
Wow, Hiroko-senpai works on

54
00:03:24,501 --> 00:03:26,110
local events too.

55
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,030
Yeah.

56
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,430
It's surprising, right?

57
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,434
But Hiroko-senpai is so busy,

58
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,226
it'd be better to handle it remotely.

59
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,650
I thought so too,

60
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:37,076
but if that's the case, I wouldn't be
able to go on a business trip with senpai.

61
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,621
Ayaka,

62
00:03:40,645 --> 00:03:43,112
you truly like Hiroko-senpai, don't you?

63
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:44,780
Yes.

64
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,880
I really like her.

65
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,900
You mean you're sharing a room?

66
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,970
We're not sharing a room!

67
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,430
It's for work!

68
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,630
If it were me, I'd find any excuse

69
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,930
to get into the same room!

70
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,180
Heh, don't assume I'm like you.

71
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,711
Hmm... But is this really okay,

72
00:04:13,727 --> 00:04:14,727
Hiro-chan?

73
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,000
Can you stay calm in such a situation?

74
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,380
Even you, Mama...

75
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:22,827
It's strictly work.

76
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,230
Besides...

77
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,740
That girl has a boy she likes.

78
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,191
Ayaka, this is your first

79
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,242
business trip, right?

80
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:48,017
Yes.

81
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,472
But I'll do my best

82
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,231
not to trouble you, Senpai!

83
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,400
Wow, that's reassuring.

84
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,140
Yes.

85
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,480
I wore the one Risa chose, but...

86
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,040
(An auspicious day)

87
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,420
Cha...

88
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,730
(Love Hiroko)

89
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:14,090
- Heave Ho!
- Heave Ho!

90
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,770
Senpai, can you accept me now?

91
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,610
Yes!

92
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,450
- Heave Ho!
- Heave Ho!

93
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,460
Ayaka!

94
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,290
Let's go.

95
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,760
Yes.

96
00:05:27,114 --> 00:05:30,230
Focus! We're working today.

97
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:36,007
The event we're planning will be

98
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,246
held here at this market.

99
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,790
It's such a lively place.

100
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,610
Yeah.

101
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,570
Yamamoto-san.

102
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,030
Oh, Hiroko-chan!

103
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,860
- Hello.
- Ah, I've been waiting for you.

104
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,590
Alright.

105
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,590
Sorry, sorry, please excuse me.

106
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,326
This is Yamamoto-san from

107
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:55,904
a traditional tuna factory.

108
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,160
And this is my junior colleague...

109
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,630
I'm Toda Ayaka.

110
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,260
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you for coming all this way.

111
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,015
I'm sorry I don't have a business card.

112
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,649
Yamamoto-san makes

113
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:08,355
delicious tuna croquettes

114
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,330
and now he's ready for this project.

115
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,010
- Oh.
- No.

116
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,211
That's because Hiroko-chan

117
00:06:12,228 --> 00:06:13,375
planned the project.

118
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,704
This meeting could've

119
00:06:14,712 --> 00:06:15,756
been done remotely, though.

120
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,020
No, I wanted to see you, Yamamoto-san.

121
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,354
And I wanted to eat those

122
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:21,518
delicious tuna croquettes.

123
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:22,493
Really?

124
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:25,195
Then this is for you.

125
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,550
- Yay!
- Here, take it.

126
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,420
- Is it okay?
- Thank you!

127
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,080
Enjoy!

128
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,030
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

129
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,260
Eat them while they're hot.

130
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:32,800
Umm...

131
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,960
Hiroko-chan

132
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,436
really pays attention to

133
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:36,655
each of us individually.

134
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,120
- I'm really grateful.
- No,

135
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:42,978
I just enjoy working with everyone here.

136
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,010
Senpai's work is so warm.

137
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,810
I'll work hard to stand by your side.

138
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,530
Going to the chairman's place next, yes?

139
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,120
Yes.

140
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,100
Do your best.

141
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,080
- Yes.
- Yeah.

142
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,370
- Excuse us.
- Sure.

143
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,000
- Thank you!
- Yeah.

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,050
- See you later.
- Thank you!

145
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,250
Bye-bye!

146
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,460
(Sweet potato seaweed
a gift from the Akamoku ocean)

147
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,200
(Tuna Kushikatsu
stewed tuna)

148
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,080
- Ah! Hiroko-san!
- Ah, Hatanaka-san!

149
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,190
- Long time no see.
- It's been a while.

150
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,420
Ah, that is...

151
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,670
- It's completed, right?
- That's right.

152
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,450
Are you okay? Let me help.

153
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,450
Oh, thank you.

154
00:07:26,342 --> 00:07:28,250
- Here you go.
- Huh? You are...

155
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,187
I'm Todo Ayaka from SAL Creative,

156
00:07:30,212 --> 00:07:32,345
helping with this year's event.

157
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,725
I'll give it my all! Nice to meet you!

158
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,710
Thank you very much. Just here is fine.

159
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,160
- Thank you, thank you!
- Are you alright?

160
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,370
- Alright.
- Oh, please wait.

161
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,560
- Oh.
- Oww...

162
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,030
You dropped something, Uncle.

163
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,610
- Ah. Thank you.
- No problem.

164
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,080
But I'm an "Auntie."

165
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,550
"Auntie?"

166
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,730
This is the chairman.

167
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,390
I'm so sorry!

168
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,390
I apologize deeply!

169
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,270
- Her eyesight isn't great.
- Sorry, I'm truly sorry.

170
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,880
We apologize.

171
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,180
Chairman, nice to meet you.

172
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,260
Haa... I'm tired.

173
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,860
I'm so sorry, Senpai,

174
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,340
for my manners.

175
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,480
It's okay.

176
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,120
The chairman said you were energetic.

177
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,480
Yes.

178
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:24,057
Yes...

179
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,820
I even wore my good luck underwear…

180
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,130
Haa...

181
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:38,220
But I was a bit impressed.

182
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,530
Huh?

183
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,150
Ayaka, you've changed.

184
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,580
Really?

185
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,110
Yes.

186
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,530
The past you...

187
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,220
How should I put it?

188
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,910
I used to be quite rigid.

189
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,300
Let's go. Well?

190
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,690
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

191
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,570
Let's go. That's great!

192
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,520
- Everyone, let's go!
- Let's go!

193
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,660
Calm down, let's take that one too.

194
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,160
Sure.

195
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,700
- You're going too, right?
- Yes.

196
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,330
- Yes.
- I'm glad.

197
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,510
Umm... Ayaka-chan, right?

198
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,451
We'll discuss about

199
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:19,147
tomorrow's gathering.

200
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,570
What do you think, Ayaka-chan?

201
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,380
I'm going home.

202
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,380
Oh, sorry, do you have plans?

203
00:09:28,148 --> 00:09:29,328
It's time to clock out.

204
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,440
Oh.

205
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,630
Is joining necessary?

206
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,070
Ah.

207
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,180
Not necessary...

208
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,700
Excuse me then.

209
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:42,600
Let's go.

210
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,730
You're going, right?

211
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,450
That's right.

212
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,970
- It's fine.
- Ah, Ayaka-chan...

213
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,140
- Huh?
- Huh?

214
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,440
Ah? Huh?

215
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,760
Hey, everyone, look this way.

216
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,860
- Stop looking already! Stop!
- I already stopped.

217
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,380
- Huh?
- What are you doing?

218
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,620
I'm sorry.

219
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,020
Not at all, not at all.

220
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,670
It wasn't a bad thing.

221
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,110
But now...

222
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,670
I want to learn from you, Senpai,

223
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,950
and work well with each person.

224
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,050
So I can stand by your side proudly.

225
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,350
I see.

226
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:27,121
And it's because of you, Hiroko-senpai,

227
00:10:27,137 --> 00:10:28,730
that I've changed.

228
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,920
Even during today's trip,

229
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,180
I realized again

230
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,800
how much I like you, Hiroko-senpai.

231
00:10:49,137 --> 00:10:50,837
- What's wrong?
- Ah.

232
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,370
Ah... No.

233
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,040
It's nothing...

234
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,370
shall we go buy some souvenirs later?

235
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,780
Souvenirs for Risa?

236
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,630
For Risa too,

237
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,635
but I also want to give them

238
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,909
to others as well.

239
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,260
It's the hotel.

240
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,650
Hello.

241
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,560
Maybe I got a little closer to Senpai.

242
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,301
Even if the good luck charm

243
00:11:22,326 --> 00:11:23,497
didn't work perfectly.

244
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,090
Huh?

245
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:31,930
Yes.

246
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,150
We sincerely apologize!

247
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,148
No worries, if the drainage pipe burst,

248
00:11:41,164 --> 00:11:42,898
there's nothing we can do.

249
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,600
We tried to arrange a replacement room,

250
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,370
but all the singles are occupied...

251
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,250
Huh?

252
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,740
We'll guide you to a double room.

253
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,790
Wait, what? Wait!

254
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,300
Good job, good luck charm!

255
00:11:57,736 --> 00:11:59,480
My self-control is at risk!

256
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,690
Wow, it's spacious.

257
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,660
Double...

258
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,750
A double bed?

259
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:11,915
What is this honeymoon setup?

260
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,404
What kind of apology is this?

261
00:12:13,412 --> 00:12:14,833
What kind of trial is this?

262
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,590
Calm down!

263
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,020
Can I even calm down?

264
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,900
Being alone with Hiroko-senpai

265
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,516
in a honeymoon-type room

266
00:12:23,524 --> 00:12:24,586
with a double bed!

267
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,680
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance!

268
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,020
Thank you, good luck charm!

269
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,370
Thank you, good fortune!

270
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,880
Let's unpack.

271
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,750
Ah, yes.

272
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,243
Wait, are you planning to

273
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:47,576
wear that tomorrow?

274
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,760
Isn't it too short?

275
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,410
And it smells… nice…

276
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,550
- Senpai.
- Yes?

277
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,710
Do you want to take a shower first?

278
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,690
Or later?

279
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,410
Or...

280
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,020
should we go together?

281
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,590
So, how will you respond?

282
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,970
Are there that many options?

283
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,402
What are you saying?

284
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:14,098
You can go first, Ayaka.

285
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,940
Okay, I'll go first then.

286
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,750
Sure.

287
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,580
No. I won't back down this easily.

288
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,210
Don't think about weird things!

289
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,880
Remember, Hiroko, she's straight!

290
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:32,475
And she has a guy she likes!

291
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,480
Haa...

292
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,070
I can't miss this chance!

293
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,410
I'll use every method

294
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,610
to confess my feelings to Hiroko-senpai.

295
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,730
Why?

296
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,590
Why did this have to happen?

297
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,160
Ugh. I can't calm down.

298
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,490
I need coffee.

299
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,660
Alright, ah.

300
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:14,960
Haa...

301
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,620
Haa...

302
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,770
Senpai, this feels great!

303
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,430
Ow, that's hot...

304
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,370
Senpai? Are you okay?

305
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,880
I'm fine!

306
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,620
Why am I going through this ordeal?

307
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,010
Haa...

308
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,730
I'm glad I brought this…

309
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,230
Alright!

310
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,560
Senpai, you can take a shower now.

311
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,760
Okay, I'll go...

312
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,100
Hey, hey, hey! Are you insane?

313
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,489
Sorry.

314
00:15:04,498 --> 00:15:06,669
This is what I usually wear at home.

315
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,540
Of course, I bought this new!

316
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,430
Ah… I see.

317
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,710
Oh! Senpai,

318
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,185
this body milk is

319
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:18,169
amazing for moisturizing.

320
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,000
And...

321
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,950
And it smells so good.

322
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,360
Ah… that's nice.

323
00:15:29,659 --> 00:15:31,180
Want to smell it?

324
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,640
Smell it? From her skin?

325
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,760
Ah, it's okay.

326
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,923
I can smell it from here,

327
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:45,119
it's really nice!

328
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,890
Hmm... Not working.

329
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,910
In that case…

330
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,030
Hiroko-senpai.

331
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,920
Can you apply this on my back?

332
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,240
Come on! Apply it, Senpai!

333
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,531
Wait, are straight people

334
00:16:01,556 --> 00:16:03,236
usually this defenseless?

335
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,360
How does my back feel?

336
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,256
I don't understand what
girls these days play at.

337
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,756
What's the right move?

338
00:16:16,781 --> 00:16:18,295
What's straight-like answer?

339
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,050
Ayaka!

340
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,790
You'll catch a cold dressed like that!

341
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,060
Look, there's a yukata.

342
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,010
Wear it. You need to stay warm.

343
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,930
I'm going to take a shower now!

344
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,613
I already did this much

345
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:37,136
and it's still not reaching her.

346
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,080
Don't give up! Keep moving forward.

347
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,120
That was dangerous!

348
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,391
I was really flustered,

349
00:16:44,408 --> 00:16:45,946
but I somehow managed.

350
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,060
Huh? I can manage, right?

351
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:56,020
Senpai, I'll dry your hair!

352
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,570
Ah! It's okay!

353
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,339
My hair is like a Golden Retriever's!

354
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:02,355
Thank you!

355
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,185
What a coincidence!

356
00:17:03,201 --> 00:17:04,026
I have one at my parent's house.

357
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:04,690
I'm good at it!

358
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,920
No, really, it's okay!

359
00:17:06,285 --> 00:17:08,625
My hair is really bad. Thanks.

360
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,500
Senpai.

361
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,170
I don't know why I feel a bit cold…

362
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:22,870
Can you warm me up?

363
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,000
Ah. Cold?

364
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,370
That's terrible.

365
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,370
I'll call the front desk and get help.

366
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,240
Umm... What to do?

367
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,000
Good afternoon! No! Good evening!

368
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,560
Could we get a blanket?

369
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,600
Yes, a thick one, please.

370
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,640
Alright, let's go to sleep.

371
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,400
Senpai, I'm a bit scared of the dark.

372
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,250
Can we hold hands while we sleep?

373
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,160
Scared?

374
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,615
Then, I'll leave this light on!

375
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:55,796
Ah, no nightlight?

376
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,620
Then I'll turn this lamp on.

377
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,650
It's okay, we'll wake up in the morning.

378
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,690
Let's sleep.

379
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,956
Is being in the same room

380
00:18:09,972 --> 00:18:11,796
with these straights this dangerous?

381
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,058
I only knew how to act

382
00:18:13,074 --> 00:18:14,628
with ulterior motives.

383
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,950
I wasn't aware at all.

384
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,425
I put so much effort,

385
00:18:18,441 --> 00:18:20,026
why doesn't she understand?

386
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,331
Even friends would notice something

387
00:18:22,356 --> 00:18:24,378
if I acted like this!

388
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,580
But I don't have many friends to know…

389
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,780
I knew it...

390
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:35,030
is this love just that impossible?

391
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,400
But now...

392
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,970
I want to learn from you, Senpai,

393
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,330
and work well with each person.

394
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:58,040
So I can stand by your side proudly.

395
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,140
Ayaka. Are you awake?

396
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,670
Ah. Yes.

397
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,730
Can you keep me company?

398
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:31,920
Huh?

399
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,450
Thank you.

400
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,040
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

401
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,236
This sake is...

402
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,290
Someone at the market gave it to me.

403
00:19:59,962 --> 00:20:02,392
I thought of sharing it with you.

404
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,100
With me?

405
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,710
You worked really hard today, right?

406
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,350
You've been studying a lot since

407
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,630
you decided to go on this trip, right?

408
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,550
Not quite enough.

409
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,880
Thank you for your hard work.

410
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,870
I...

411
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,624
Want to receive compliments

412
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:36,881
from the senior I like.

413
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,650
So I'm trying my best.

414
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,613
If you keep saying

415
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:50,318
such misleading things…

416
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,450
I might take you seriously.

417
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,390
Ah.

418
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,270
She's weak to alcohol.

419
00:21:03,074 --> 00:21:04,581
That was close!

420
00:21:04,606 --> 00:21:06,925
Glad she didn't hear that!

421
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,220
Haa...

422
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,640
- Haa...
- Haa...

423
00:21:19,532 --> 00:21:21,310
Time to head back to the city!

424
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,450
Yes!

425
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:25,940
Ah.

426
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,010
Ayaka, you've got a stain there.

427
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,980
Where?

428
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,380
Here.

429
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,460
Oh, you're right!

430
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,580
How did that happen?

431
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,380
Huh?

432
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,530
See?

433
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:40,520
Haa...

434
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,630
Senpai, this feels great!

435
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,550
Ow, that's hot...

436
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,050
Ah.

437
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,040
That was my fault!

438
00:21:49,065 --> 00:21:51,315
Ah. It's totally fine.

439
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,812
I've been wearing this for a while

440
00:21:52,837 --> 00:21:53,797
and was thinking of getting

441
00:21:53,822 --> 00:21:54,586
a new one anyway.

442
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,460
No, no, no! What to do?

443
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,606
Are you free this weekend?

444
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,114
Let me buy you a new one!

445
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,130
Hiroko-senpai... A new outfit?

446
00:22:05,511 --> 00:22:07,470
Could that be…

447
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,020
A date?

448
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,450
(Next episode)
Are you free this weekend?

449
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,560
Let me buy you a new one!

450
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,920
Hiroko-senpai... A new outfit?

451
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,200
I think senior is very energetic.

452
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,490
Meeting Ayaka outside of work

453
00:23:39,514 --> 00:23:41,155
feels very refreshing.

454
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,370
Right.

455
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,240
Well? Do you like it?

456
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,794
Looking at others with

457
00:23:45,818 --> 00:23:47,095
those seductive eyes.

458
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,130
I did not!

459
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,365
The person Ayaka likes

460
00:23:49,381 --> 00:23:50,756
is Hiroko-senpai, right?

461
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,255
A love that couldn't be conveyed,

462
00:23:52,271 --> 00:23:53,471
just forget about it.

463
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,040
So cute.

464
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,560
It didn't reach her at all.

465
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,650
Is it because I'm a woman?
