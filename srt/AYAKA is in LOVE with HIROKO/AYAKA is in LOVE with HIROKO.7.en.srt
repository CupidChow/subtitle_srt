1
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,450
I...

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,170
love Hiroko-senpai!

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,570
Huh?

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,220
- Huh?
- Huh?

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,130
So, I'm going to pursue her!

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,716
I'll do my best to win

7
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:21,921
Hiroko-senpai's heart!

8
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:25,078
Of course, I will do my work properly!

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,030
And I won't cause any problems.

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,840
Thank you very much!

11
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,365
But I have an appointment,

12
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:34,016
so I'll be out until around noon!

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,160
Thank you for listening!

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,370
It's over.

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,430
Now, what will

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,880
everyone's reaction be?

17
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:55,850
Disappointed.

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,950
Forced laughter?

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,800
Or boycott?

20
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:03,220
Or...

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,550
Wait, Hiroko.

22
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,365
That was a

23
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:15,116
once-in-a-lifetime confession!

24
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,678
What are you standing around for?

25
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:17,486
Come on!

26
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,300
As expected of Hiroko-senpai!

27
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,090
Even girls are into you!

28
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,170
I was aiming for Ayaka-chan, though!

29
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,810
Kids these days have guts!

30
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,941
Confessing in front of

31
00:01:25,957 --> 00:01:27,006
everyone like that!

32
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,880
So, what's your response, Hiroko?

33
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,990
Come on!

34
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:30,800
Huh?

35
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,300
Huh?

36
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,670
This kind of reaction?

37
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,380
Wait!

38
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,110
I really like Hiroko-san!

39
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,420
Are you seriously going to date Ayaka?

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,170
Huh?

41
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,890
I'll also pursue her!

42
00:01:48,351 --> 00:01:50,007
I won't lose to Ayaka!

43
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,190
Ugh.

44
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,080
Because Hiroko's so kind.

45
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,520
So you're quite popular.

46
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,780
Hey! Don't cause a scene

47
00:01:58,788 --> 00:02:00,306
in the office, okay?

48
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,160
Right?

49
00:02:02,127 --> 00:02:03,097
You too.

50
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,270
Me?

51
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,316
Thanks for your hard work. Risa.

52
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:09,321
Hey, Ayaka,

53
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:10,640
about this morning…

54
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,810
Yeah. I managed to raise my voice!

55
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,110
That's not what I meant.

56
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,360
Mama told us about it.

57
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,080
That's why Hiroko-chan

58
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,080
has been working desperately

59
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,450
hiding the truth

60
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,730
ever since that happened.

61
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,120
So why…

62
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,430
I'm absolutely sure it'll be okay.

63
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,820
Ayaka...

64
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,510
I

65
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,480
will never give up on Hiroko-senpai.

66
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,250
"Ayaka is in Love with Hiroko"

67
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,890
"Episode 7 Girls' stuff"

68
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,460
What do you intend to do?

69
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,530
Saying that in front of everyone.

70
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,808
I just wanted everyone

71
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,353
to know how I feel.

72
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,360
I

73
00:03:48,126 --> 00:03:50,816
don't intend to come out at the company.

74
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,970
- So...
- I understand.

75
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,840
I will never leak Hiroko-senpai's secret

76
00:03:56,848 --> 00:03:58,325
from my mouth.

77
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,400
I just...

78
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,980
can't give up

79
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,951
because I'm in love with someone

80
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:07,167
who's a woman.

81
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,870
Just as you can't tell the truth,

82
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,880
I also can't lie about my feelings.

83
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,880
Ayaka...

84
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,251
If Hiroko-senpai isn't interested

85
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:21,651
in dating me…

86
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,880
my feelings for
Hiroko-senpai are mine alone.

87
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,210
No one can interfere with them,

88
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,790
not even Hiroko-senpai.

89
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,140
But...

90
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:37,960
I…

91
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,300
Also,

92
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:42,474
I didn't confess without any chance.

93
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,460
Huh?

94
00:04:46,842 --> 00:04:48,119
I knew it, you really like

95
00:04:48,152 --> 00:04:49,524
off-shoulder tops,

96
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,043
When I walked in,

97
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:52,277
you had an expression

98
00:04:52,278 --> 00:04:53,316
that you're pleased.

99
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,990
Even if you try to hide it, it's no use.

100
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,920
Because I'm always watching.

101
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,850
I've been watching you for a long time.

102
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,481
I'll pursue you with all my strength,
so be prepared!

103
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,130
What does this mean?

104
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,609
No, but off-shoulder tops

105
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,985
are just unfair.

106
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:25,880
Haa...

107
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,407
Did you hear about Ayaka-chan's

108
00:05:30,423 --> 00:05:31,906
confession yesterday?

109
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,203
Yeah, she confessed to

110
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:34,648
Hiroko-senpai, right?

111
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,980
Well, it's fine, right?

112
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,070
We need to accept things

113
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,490
in this era.

114
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,540
Right? I hope it works out!

115
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,540
Yeah.

116
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,350
I guess I'll try harder too.

117
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,100
- How about we plan an event for this?
- This era...

118
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,980
Work, work.

119
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,870
Is this right?

120
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,060
Here?

121
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,080
No.

122
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,710
Huh? Maybe over here?

123
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,720
Ayaka, what are you doing?

124
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,410
I'm making this for Hiroko-senpai.

125
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,260
Ayaka-chan, did you come out?

126
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,810
Huh? Come out?

127
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,890
- Come...
- Disclosure one's sexual orientation.

128
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,420
Oh, is that so?

129
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,970
I already come out, huh?

130
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,417
It's okay,

131
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:21,506
I like both yuri and BL,

132
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,040
so I understand!

133
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,490
Ah...

134
00:06:25,322 --> 00:06:26,812
I don't accept that!

135
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,100
I like Hiroko-san more!

136
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,870
I want Ayaka-chan to succeed, though!

137
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,651
Yeah, typically, liking a guy

138
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:36,729
gives them an advantage,

139
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,213
seeing Ayaka-chan's big changes

140
00:06:38,222 --> 00:06:39,526
would be exciting!

141
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,220
Ayaka-chan, if you have any problems,

142
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:43,269
come to me!

143
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:48,275
Everyone seems to be supporting her,

144
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,435
but…

145
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,740
It's nothing.

146
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,252
I just want to tell the person

147
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:53,488
I like how I feel.

148
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:54,880
Huh?

149
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:56,308
Alright.

150
00:06:56,715 --> 00:06:58,015
That's right!

151
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,689
Everyone, instead of supporting

152
00:06:59,705 --> 00:07:01,174
the love between the girls,

153
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,916
let's support Ayaka and

154
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:04,986
Hiroko-senpai's relationship!

155
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,370
Yes, exactly!

156
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,980
Ayaka and I are pure romantic rivals,

157
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,120
so it's not about gender!

158
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,770
Right?

159
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:15,710
Yes, that's right!

160
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,580
Ah… I guess so.

161
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,058
Maybe we were treating it too specially.

162
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,074
Sorry.

163
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,975
Good for you, Ayaka!

164
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,930
Ayaka?

165
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,090
Okay! Done!

166
00:07:30,642 --> 00:07:32,250
I'm going to win Hiroko-senpai's

167
00:07:32,258 --> 00:07:33,625
heart and stomach, rigth?

168
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,910
- Ah...
- Ah...

169
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,050
That's so like Ayaka-chan.

170
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,053
Hiroko-senpai! Thanks for

171
00:07:50,077 --> 00:07:50,996
your hard work!

172
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,350
Please enjoy this for your lunch break!

173
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,250
What kind of decoration is that?

174
00:07:54,505 --> 00:07:56,415
I made this for you, senpai!

175
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,320
Here you go!

176
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,450
Ayaka, that's...

177
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,120
Here you go!

178
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,410
Yes.

179
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,930
Bon appétit.

180
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,430
It's delicious.

181
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,417
I've been practicing every day

182
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,542
since the last time I made you bento.

183
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,970
Since then...

184
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,143
you've always liked me.

185
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,560
Senpai,

186
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:30,790
ahhh...

187
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,160
Ahh...

188
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:35,508
No, no, no!

189
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:37,598
I'll eat it myself! Thank you.

190
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,900
That was close!! I was about to eat it.

191
00:08:45,595 --> 00:08:46,655
Not yet...

192
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,200
The battle has only just begun.

193
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,440
The battle...

194
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,330
Good morning.

195
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,710
Senpai! Good morning!

196
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,050
Abdominal surface.

197
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,100
I've decided on a girly look today!

198
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,860
Do you like this kind of outfit?

199
00:09:13,575 --> 00:09:14,550
I love it!

200
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,020
Thank goodness, you like it!

201
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,680
What? Did I say that?

202
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,020
It was on your face!

203
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,620
Huh?

204
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,932
This is the schedule for

205
00:09:21,948 --> 00:09:23,246
next week's music event!

206
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,790
Please check it!

207
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,470
Thank you.

208
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,300
Well then, I have a meeting.

209
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,350
Haa...

210
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,020
Ayaka is so motivated.

211
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,300
The next proposal was also approved,

212
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,770
so it seems like work is going great.

213
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,540
Right?

214
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,580
I'm so glad, Hiroko.

215
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,985
Feeling motivated by such

216
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:56,548
a hardworking girl every day.

217
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,640
No...

218
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,330
Yeah.

219
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,830
- Hiroko-senpai!
- Hmm?

220
00:10:13,107 --> 00:10:14,797
Today I'm wearing slits!

221
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,100
Slits!

222
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,320
Ah.

223
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,850
You don't have to show them.

224
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,756
There's been a schedule change from

225
00:10:22,781 --> 00:10:24,346
the other party for tomorrow's meeting,

226
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,420
so I've reserved a different

227
00:10:25,444 --> 00:10:26,340
conference room!

228
00:10:26,365 --> 00:10:27,470
Oh, thank you.

229
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,500
And...

230
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,223
I've also compiled the improvements that

231
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:31,714
came up in yesterday's meeting!

232
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:32,349
Huh?

233
00:10:32,969 --> 00:10:33,945
You compiled this in such

234
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:34,806
a short amount of time?

235
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,740
Yes! Because I thought it was necessary!

236
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,250
Oh... that's a big help, thank you.

237
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,810
And this too.

238
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,610
Hmm?

239
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:44,870
Is this a document too?

240
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,720
It's a love letter.

241
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,680
A 10,000-word masterpiece.

242
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,360
Please read it all.

243
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,250
A love letter?

244
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,490
Wow! A love letter!

245
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,810
Finally, making a proper approach.

246
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,390
No, this approach isn't proper!

247
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,590
Hiroko-senpai,

248
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,030
I'll write you a love letter too!

249
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,480
Yeah. Thanks.

250
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,830
Hmmm...

251
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:33,807
Stretching, so cute.

252
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,209
Senpai!

253
00:11:36,234 --> 00:11:38,767
I can't reach this document up there.

254
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,530
I'll get it.

255
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,970
Thank you, senpai.

256
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:46,740
Too close!

257
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,320
There's such a big height difference.

258
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,230
Ah, ah, ah.

259
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,120
Ah... I'm sorry!

260
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,450
Ah.

261
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,770
Slapping a wall fiercely?

262
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,740
Indeed.

263
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,130
No!

264
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,710
I didn't do it!

265
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,000
Wait!

266
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,010
Yuya!

267
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,180
(Dear Hiroko-senpai)

268
00:12:25,352 --> 00:12:26,482
Hey, do your work.

269
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:27,760
Yes.

270
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,130
Senpai!

271
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,600
Oh.

272
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,750
Cute hairstyle.

273
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,150
How about we go on a date sometime?

274
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,040
A date?

275
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,410
Wait, everyone's looking.

276
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,130
Huh?

277
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,230
I want to get some exercise!

278
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,470
Do you want to play sports with me?

279
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,520
Huh?

280
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,500
Everyone...

281
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,150
are you all getting used to it already?

282
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,870
Senpai! Do you want to go on a date?

283
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,450
Okay, I'll go!

284
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,220
But please keep your voice down.

285
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,160
Yay!

286
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,690
Ha... so cute!

287
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,560
Okay,

288
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,800
let's do it.

289
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,180
I'm going to play tennis with senpai.

290
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,890
Senpai! Please be gentle.

291
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,470
Okay!

292
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,270
Senpai's gym clothes! They're cool!

293
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,030
Ayaka's gym clothes are cute.

294
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,460
Oh!

295
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,240
Senpai, your ball is strong!

296
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,680
Really? Ayaka has good control, too.

297
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,770
It's kind of refreshing.

298
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,100
Almost lovely.

299
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,180
Ahhh,

300
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,943
it's great to be able to

301
00:13:59,968 --> 00:14:01,648
play sports with senpai!

302
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,320
Ah!

303
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,320
Whoa!

304
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,010
You're good.

305
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,140
Ha, that was fun!

306
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,190
Right?

307
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,972
It's been a while since

308
00:14:19,997 --> 00:14:21,089
I last exercised.

309
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,480
It was my dream.

310
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,894
To hang out with you on a day off...

311
00:14:26,902 --> 00:14:28,582
for no particular reason.

312
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:32,930
So...

313
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:34,957
I'm so glad I mustered up

314
00:14:34,982 --> 00:14:36,402
the courage to ask you out.

315
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,880
Me too.

316
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:58,550
Huh?

317
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,170
I'm sorry.

318
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,630
Ummm...

319
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,600
There was some sweat.

320
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,920
Does this...

321
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:14,760
Could it be...

322
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,720
Good morning, Hiroko-senpai!

323
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,000
Ayaka, good morning.

324
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,490
Thank you for yesterday!

325
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,190
Likewise.

326
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,310
If it's not too much trouble for you,

327
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,520
would we go out together again?

328
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,520
Ah...

329
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,010
Yeah.

330
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,990
Is this...

331
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,660
Do I have a chance...

332
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,501
In that case, let's arrange for

333
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,086
our next meeting to be next Friday.

334
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,450
Yes, yes, yes.

335
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:52,910
Mmm.

336
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,720
By the way, Hiroko-kun,

337
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,126
I heard a junior female employee

338
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,759
confessed her feelings to you?

339
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:02,980
It even reached Saruta-san's ears?

340
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,990
You hear that a lot these days.

341
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:08,820
It's called LGBTQ, right?

342
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,330
Yes.

343
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,540
Yeah.

344
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,730
Well, love is free, isn't it?

345
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:14,840
Yeah.

346
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,450
- Right.
- Yeah.

347
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,070
But...

348
00:16:22,007 --> 00:16:23,887
Those girls are fine now,

349
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,495
but what will they do when

350
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,199
they get married and

351
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,920
have kids in the future?

352
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,130
You're right.

353
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,610
- How old is she?
- Umm...

354
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,690
23 years old.

355
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,150
Hmm, she's young!

356
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,070
Well,

357
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,441
it's good to have that

358
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,106
kind of life experience.

359
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,050
- Yes.
- Yes.

360
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:50,720
Oh, that's right. Saruta-san.

361
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,190
Hmm?

362
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,170
- How was that sauna you mentioned?
- Ah! I was wondering about that too!

363
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,460
- Ah, right.
- Yes.

364
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,570
- There was something like that.
- How was it?

365
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,360
That's how I was supposed to react.

366
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,860
- How nice.
- The water was so good.

367
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,060
I almost got it wrong.

368
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,310
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

369
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,820
That's right, Hiroko-kun.

370
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,667
Make sure you think about

371
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:08,824
that thing properly.

372
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,800
Yes.

373
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,267
You weren't in the office,

374
00:17:27,275 --> 00:17:28,475
so you're here.

375
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,960
Oh. Ayaka.

376
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,420
Your hair is messy!

377
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,730
Have you been here this whole time?

378
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,920
No, just a while ago.

379
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,580
It's time to go, so I'll go now.

380
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,390
Did she just avoid me?

381
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,150
If she feel the same way,

382
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:00,382
why are you still hesitating?

383
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,620
- Public confession?
- Public confession?

384
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,140
Something has happened

385
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,080
since you last came here.

386
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,530
As expected of Ayaka, she went all out.

387
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,305
That's great! I want someone to do

388
00:18:37,321 --> 00:18:39,375
something emotional like that to me too!

389
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,880
What did the company say?

390
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,830
Was Ayaka-chan boycotted?

391
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,310
Mmm...

392
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:46,930
Well...

393
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,518
It was a different reaction

394
00:18:48,534 --> 00:18:49,586
than I expected.

395
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:50,940
Of course.

396
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,030
Things have changed since the old days.

397
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,610
But...

398
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,462
Some people were being considerate

399
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,136
and keeping up with the times.

400
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,423
Those girls are fine now,

401
00:19:01,691 --> 00:19:03,234
but what will they do when

402
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:04,939
they get married and

403
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,480
have kids in the future?

404
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,618
Not everyone has intention of

405
00:19:08,642 --> 00:19:10,576
giving sincere congratulations.

406
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,330
Hiro-chan.

407
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,710
Ah, what a gloomy woman!

408
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
I could never sleep

409
00:19:15,951 --> 00:19:16,895
with a woman like that!

410
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,966
I'd never sleep with

411
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:19,146
a woman like you either!

412
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,340
I wouldn't sleep with you either!

413
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,810
First of all, I'm not interested!

414
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,800
- Huh? I'm not interested either!
- Oh. Isn't it about time now?

415
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,900
Aren't you going home?

416
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,210
- I just got here!
- Oh, is that so? That's good for you.

417
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:27,620
Hmph!

418
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,530
Shut up!

419
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,610
Umm...

420
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:43,804
That thing you were talking about...

421
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,972
was this a reply to what happened

422
00:19:45,981 --> 00:19:46,988
the other day?

423
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,580
Ayaka,

424
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,820
what do you want to do with me?

425
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,830
Huh?

426
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,590
Ummm...

427
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,520
I want to become closer to you.

428
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,400
And...

429
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,930
I'd like to go out with you!

430
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,750
Umm...

431
00:20:16,727 --> 00:20:17,857
If we go out together,

432
00:20:18,493 --> 00:20:19,970
what do we have to do to reach the goal?

433
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,590
I don't know what the goal is, though.

434
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:24,870
Ah...

435
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:27,710
Go on a date.

436
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,110
Oh.

437
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,720
The other day was fun.

438
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:33,950
Yes.

439
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,780
We ate dessert and took pictures.

440
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,200
And we went on trips!

441
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,920
That's right,

442
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,945
we went on a business trip together.

443
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,480
Yes, it was for work,

444
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,860
but we rode the train, ate meals...

445
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,570
it was so much fun.

446
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:52,990
Yeah.

447
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,860
I had fun too.

448
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,570
And then...

449
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,620
Do that...

450
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,070
H...

451
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,160
Hug each other.

452
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,420
Senpai.

453
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,190
What's next?

454
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,220
Kiss...

455
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,430
No, just kidding.

456
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,880
You've achieved everything.

457
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,180
Let's end this here,

458
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,770
Ayaka.

459
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,110
Huh?

460
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,060
I'm going to seal

461
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,140
my feelings here.

462
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,370
That's how

463
00:22:30,256 --> 00:22:32,050
I protect Ayaka.

464
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:45,850
(Final episode)

465
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,180
Why don't you understand?

466
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,610
Don't you actually like Ayaka?

467
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,750
Is that okay? What if Hiroko finds out?

468
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:57,090
Stop killing your feelings.

469
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,260
I...
