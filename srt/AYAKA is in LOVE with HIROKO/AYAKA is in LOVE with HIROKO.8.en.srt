1
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,440
You've achieved everything.

2
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,620
Let's end this here,

3
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,140
Ayaka.

4
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,620
Huh?

5
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,070
I can't accept that.

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,170
I did

7
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,340
my best to do everything you wanted.

8
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,060
Could you please listen to my request?

9
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:50,830
Huh?

10
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,780
I...

11
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:58,770
cannot like you.

12
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,940
"Ayaka is in Love with Hiroko"

13
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,450
"Episode 8: The Decision of Love"
Collect these documents

14
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,360
- Yes.
- to use in the next meeting.

15
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:05,700
Yes.

16
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,380
Is it not good?

17
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,350
Would this be alright?

18
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,020
Oh, sorry. Please decide on this

19
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:12,206
within the next week.

20
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:12,860
- Yes.
- Yes.

21
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,970
Oh, this...

22
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,560
Does Hiroko look cooler than ever?

23
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,100
Mmm...

24
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,131
When she's worried,

25
00:02:22,156 --> 00:02:24,225
she likes to put pressure on herself.

26
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,410
It must be because of that.

27
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,750
Because she's a very responsible person,

28
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,295
she probably thinks she has to

29
00:02:34,327 --> 00:02:36,100
devote her life to work.

30
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,430
Times have changed.

31
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,146
Is she an old-fashioned office worker

32
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:41,132
or something?

33
00:02:41,157 --> 00:02:43,087
What do you mean by that?

34
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,470
- Ayaka.
- That startled me.

35
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,480
You like to suddenly appear.

36
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,870
What is Hiroko-senpai worried about?

37
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,200
No, that matter...

38
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,940
Haa... Right.

39
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,734
Hiroko-senpai is becoming

40
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,190
a sales manager?

41
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,080
Don't tell everyone yet.

42
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,707
Even though it's
something that be accepted

43
00:03:13,716 --> 00:03:15,396
without a second thought,

44
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,460
that woman likes to cause problems.

45
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,320
By the way, Yuya...

46
00:03:21,774 --> 00:03:23,469
Is it okay to talk about this

47
00:03:23,477 --> 00:03:25,157
without telling Hiroko?

48
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,410
Yeah.

49
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,960
Well,

50
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,060
if it were Ayaka, it should be fine.

51
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,420
Huh?

52
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,770
Right.

53
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,198
There must be some sides that

54
00:03:39,206 --> 00:03:40,268
only Ayaka can see.

55
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,700
Only I can see?

56
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,180
Whether it's good or bad,

57
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,920
Hiroko always carries the burden alone.

58
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,520
Hiroko-senpai, good morning.

59
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,640
Good morning.

60
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,950
Senpai, please let me help you.

61
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,339
Oh, Ayaka, thanks.

62
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:08,035
That was a great help.

63
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,619
Then...

64
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:10,932
Oh, can you hold this

65
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,006
while we wait to present?

66
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,830
Yes, leave it to me.

67
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,330
Hiroko-senpai, this is...

68
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,980
I'd like you to check this for me.

69
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,040
- Sure.
- Thank you.

70
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,110
This character...

71
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,720
When Hiroko is with Ayaka, it's like

72
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,165
she doesn't have to go to

73
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:31,672
any lengths to do anything.

74
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,399
I think she probably

75
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:34,735
enjoys herself with you.

76
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,660
Perhaps.

77
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,710
It's not just a matter of promotion,

78
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,927
but maybe she's carrying

79
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:43,302
something alone.

80
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,200
"Alone?"

81
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,310
I knew it.

82
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,660
Moreover,

83
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,070
since before, Hiroko always

84
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,120
blamed herself before blaming others.

85
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,890
That's why...

86
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,360
if Hiroko ever seems cornered,

87
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,630
I want you to say...

88
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,220
Huh?

89
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,360
- Hiroko-senpai.
- Oh, Risa.

90
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,690
What happened with Ayaka?

91
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,250
Hmm?

92
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,370
You're avoiding Ayaka, right?

93
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,440
You're really watching, huh?

94
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:46,950
Of course.

95
00:05:47,742 --> 00:05:49,430
It concerns my crush.

96
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,450
Senpai...

97
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,080
You really like Ayaka, don't you?

98
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,640
Sorry, I have a meeting later.

99
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,860
I want to learn from you, Senpai,

100
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,220
and work well with each person.

101
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,360
So I can stand by your side proudly.

102
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,550
I see.

103
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,411
And it's because of you, Hiroko-senpai,

104
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:43,876
that I've changed.

105
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,030
Even during today's trip,

106
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,380
I realized again

107
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,390
how much I like you, Hiroko-senpai.

108
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,300
I...

109
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,360
really like this girl, huh?

110
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,400
Haa...

111
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,400
What are you thinking about now?

112
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,420
Huh? Really?

113
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,380
- Yay!
- Oh!

114
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,880
Thank you very much.

115
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,500
We'll be in your care.

116
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,200
- We did it!
- Yay!

117
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,230
Hiroko-senpai is capable,

118
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,800
loved by the boss and the subordinates,

119
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,460
and is relied upon by everyone.

120
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,720
Even then...

121
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,430
And...

122
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,650
Who will Hiroko-senpai rely on?

123
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,930
What do you want to talk about?

124
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,960
I've said everything.

125
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:06,880
Yes.

126
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,953
But it didn't come from the heart,

127
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:10,978
did it?

128
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,734
Hiroko-senpai said that

129
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:17,601
because you wanted to protect me, right?

130
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,180
What are you talking about?

131
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,680
I don't care what other people say.

132
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,690
I don't care what other people say.

133
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,100
I just...

134
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,360
simply like Hiroko-senpai.

135
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,590
We are a boss and the subordinate.

136
00:08:43,478 --> 00:08:45,228
And we are one generation apart in age.

137
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,840
Yes.

138
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,670
First of all,

139
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,420
we are both women.

140
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,800
It's not related.

141
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,700
Moreover,

142
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,990
we can't get married.

143
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,799
What then?

144
00:09:00,815 --> 00:09:02,565
What about parents and children?

145
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,840
Let's think about that together.

146
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,640
Heh.

147
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:08,990
Think about that together?

148
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,640
Don't carry it all by yourself.

149
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,030
What you are worried about,

150
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,440
let me bear it too.

151
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,420
Don't say it so easily.

152
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,580
Haa...

153
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,900
To continue to stay in the company,

154
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,080
the relationship you want is too risky.

155
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,200
Not everyone actually understands.

156
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,170
Even you yourself may be criticized.

157
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,500
No matter what we do,

158
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,980
you and I will never be happy.

159
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,580
- That's not true.
- It is true.

160
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,850
It happened before.

161
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,890
A relationship ended because of that.

162
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,020
Why don't you understand?

163
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,770
Don't look down on me.

164
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,840
The one who doesn't understand is you.

165
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,095
If you don't want to reveal it,

166
00:10:08,104 --> 00:10:09,656
then you don't have to.

167
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,166
If someone makes fun of you,

168
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,230
just tell me.

169
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,480
I won't lose to other people's voices.

170
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:15,820
But...

171
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,208
do you think someone will

172
00:10:18,232 --> 00:10:19,592
actually do that?

173
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,620
Huh?

174
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,180
Yuya-senpai and Kumi-senpai said,

175
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,300
if Hiroko ever seems cornered,

176
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,350
I want you to say...

177
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,910
that we will

178
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,880
not leave Hiroko alone ever again.

179
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,360
I'm sure Senior Hiroko will understand.

180
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,174
That it's different from when

181
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:44,955
your senpai had to face the pain.

182
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,050
No one said anything bad about you.

183
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,750
That...

184
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,698
Isn't it the trust that you

185
00:10:52,706 --> 00:10:54,588
worked so hard to build?

186
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,990
Just like you did to me

187
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,534
didn't you also do it on purpose

188
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:02,982
to face everyone?

189
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,830
Stop killing your own feelings.

190
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,790
But...

191
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,542
you're still young,

192
00:11:19,558 --> 00:11:21,581
and can still get married and have kids.

193
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,433
There are many good people

194
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:25,776
outside the company.

195
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,237
There is still a possibility that

196
00:11:27,246 --> 00:11:28,726
you'll fall in love with someone else.

197
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:29,955
Is that really alright?

198
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,487
Even though I know that you

199
00:11:32,503 --> 00:11:33,506
have an ex-girlfriend.

200
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,090
Did your ex like it?

201
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,550
Even though you treat me like a kid.

202
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:40,500
My niece! I think you're like my niece.

203
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,680
Even though you lied.

204
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,730
I...

205
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,100
am not a lesbian.

206
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,600
Even if I got dumped,

207
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,190
But even so, I like you.

208
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,194
About marriage, kids, us being women,

209
00:11:54,218 --> 00:11:55,256
whatever it may be,

210
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,585
I'll never give up on you

211
00:11:56,593 --> 00:11:57,686
for those reasons,

212
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,014
absolutely not.

213
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,640
I don't like others.

214
00:12:14,937 --> 00:12:16,257
That kind of thing...

215
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,867
I don't want to hear it from

216
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,500
the mouth of the person I like.

217
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,270
I see...

218
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
I...

219
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,020
kill my own feelings,

220
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,470
and made the woman I like get hurt.

221
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,480
I'm sorry.

222
00:12:54,535 --> 00:12:55,590
I'm sorry, Ayaka.

223
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,630
I like Ayaka.

224
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,580
I don't want to...

225
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,430
lose the person I love

226
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,880
again.

227
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,300
(One year later)

228
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,250
Hiroko won't be here today, huh?

229
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,793
Seems like being a sales manager

230
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:22,796
is a lot of fun.

231
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,490
Huh, a promotion?

232
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,660
Amazing.

233
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,760
No, huh? But why?

234
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,031
How did you know about

235
00:14:29,047 --> 00:14:30,312
Hiro-chan, your enemy?

236
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,450
That is...

237
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,174
I know that from someone lovely

238
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,286
that I'm talking to.

239
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:35,970
Huh?

240
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,360
You have a girlfriend?

241
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,575
Ah, hello.

242
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,160
Welcome, my love.

243
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:45,950
Huh?

244
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,640
- Huh?
- Huh?

245
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,615
Risa-chan, are you sure

246
00:14:50,631 --> 00:14:51,846
about this woman?

247
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,580
Huh?

248
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,560
- No, we haven't...
- We're getting to know each other.

249
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,000
Right, Risako?

250
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,850
Risa-chan.

251
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,070
If you don't like it, just say "no".

252
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,539
Even if you're a Mama,

253
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:05,047
don't speak rudely.

254
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,140
- Yes.
- Hmm?

255
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,360
(Otori Jinatsu
Event Producer)

256
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,730
(Global event producer)

257
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,100
What a truly wonderful person.

258
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,020
Ayaka-senpai.

259
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,943
There's a lot of work that

260
00:15:28,951 --> 00:15:30,551
needs to be checked.

261
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,380
Sure.

262
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,820
Let's check them all out.

263
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,680
Sorry, I'm not very good.

264
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,350
Even though I thought

265
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,308
I should learn faster, but...

266
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,790
Don't do it alone.

267
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,870
Let's try together.

268
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,610
Yes.

269
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,120
Then, this way.

270
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,770
Where do you want me to check?

271
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,110
- On the second page...
- Mmm.

272
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,620
Boo!

273
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,900
Hiroko-san, you came today.

274
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,730
Good job.

275
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,620
I thought you would be shocked.

276
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,400
Oh.

277
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,890
Food is ready. Let's eat.

278
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:16,990
Yes.

279
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:22,270
Just like a newly married couple.

280
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,300
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

281
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,080
Mmm!

282
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,310
Delicious!

283
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,670
That's good.

284
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,820
Because you usually cook all the time.

285
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,100
It's fine.

286
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,334
As a sales manager,

287
00:16:44,342 --> 00:16:45,906
you always have to come home late.

288
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:46,950
Of course it's my job.

289
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,330
How is the new employee?

290
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,220
She's a good kid and very diligent.

291
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,596
Plus, everyone uses

292
00:16:54,612 --> 00:16:56,705
the guide that you made.

293
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,130
Wow, I'm glad then.

294
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,130
If it's Hiroko-san's, it must be good.

295
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,510
Everyone believes that.

296
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,480
No.

297
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,140
I trust everyone too.

298
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,940
Of course Ayaka too.

299
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,640
Hiroko-san.

300
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,650
This is the day...

301
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,910
Oh, smells so good.

302
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,990
What's wrong, Ayaka?

303
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,160
Hiroko-san...

304
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,500
Kiss!

305
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,750
Now, kiss me!

306
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,910
Her eyelashes are so long.

307
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,780
So cute.

308
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,320
Ayaka is so cute.

309
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,360
That's not it.

310
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,740
Alone in the same room with me,

311
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,180
don't you want to do this and that?

312
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,680
"This and that?"

313
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,030
I...

314
00:18:23,207 --> 00:18:24,730
have no charms?

315
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,980
I can't say that

316
00:18:26,158 --> 00:18:27,138
I'm so serious that

317
00:18:27,162 --> 00:18:28,356
I don't dare touch her.

318
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,720
No.

319
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,050
That's not it.

320
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,420
Not at all.

321
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,020
I'm glad you feel that way.

322
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,381
So please wait for me

323
00:18:39,406 --> 00:18:41,163
to handle my feelings

324
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,850
for a bit more?

325
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,330
Huh?

326
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,350
Because I...

327
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,700
want to cherish you, Ayaka.

328
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,110
Ah.

329
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,820
Alright.

330
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,860
I'm sorry, Ayaka,

331
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,550
for many things.

332
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,080
"For many things?"

333
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,060
In the end, I didn't come out.

334
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,160
Oh.

335
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,562
I know I'm making you

336
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:16,320
endure unnecessary things.

337
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:17,810
But...

338
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,370
I want to stay with you, Ayaka

339
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,910
and stay in the company, too.

340
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,400
I'm sorry that

341
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,370
you're dating a selfish person.

342
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,650
I actually wanted to shout it out

343
00:19:33,681 --> 00:19:35,481
to everyone in the company.

344
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,210
That "Hiroko-san is my girlfriend"

345
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,860
five times a day.

346
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,640
Wow, that's more than I thought.

347
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,240
But

348
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,860
I'll do my best to endure.

349
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,280
Over the years,

350
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,650
Hiroko-san has faced many problems

351
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,860
because you choose to protect others,

352
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,640
but I love what you chose.

353
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,410
Thank you, Ayaka.

354
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,190
(SAL Creative)

355
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,030
Right.

356
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,700
This...

357
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:28,690
Umm...

358
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,851
I heard that last year,

359
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:33,094
Ayaka-san confessed to manager Hiroko.

360
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,620
That's right.

361
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,800
Does that mean...

362
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,790
they're dating?

363
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,930
I wonder.

364
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,390
I don't know.

365
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,580
My approach didn't shake her one bit.

366
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,340
So sad.

367
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,750
Ayaka is still advancing like usual.

368
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:53,850
But well,

369
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,730
if they don't tell us themselves,

370
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,710
we shouldn't judge them.

371
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,470
Right.

372
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,890
But...

373
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,184
These days...

374
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:10,254
If you ask which one is expressing more,

375
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,920
it should be Hiroko...

376
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,120
Now, Hiroko-san.

377
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,790
- Do your best this after noon.
- Yes, thank you.
