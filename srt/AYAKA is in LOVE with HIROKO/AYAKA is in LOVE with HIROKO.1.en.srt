1
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,294
Good morning, Hiroko-senpai!

2
00:00:38,966 --> 00:00:40,210
Good morning, Ayaka.

3
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,930
You look different today.

4
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,100
Good morning, Yuya-senpai.

5
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,730
I bought new clothes.

6
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,600
Oh, I see.

7
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,150
They look good.

8
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,360
Yeah, cute.

9
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,240
They suit you, Ayaka.

10
00:00:54,962 --> 00:00:56,520
Thank you!

11
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,640
- Hiroko-senpai!
- Yes?

12
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,510
Hey, Risa.

13
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,130
Is that really Ayaka?

14
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,040
Yes.

15
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,170
Speaking of Ayaka...

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,020
She used to be so serious.

17
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,770
She hated socializing.

18
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,280
- It's time, I'm going home.
- She was called the Iron Mask

19
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,457
since she didn't care about love

20
00:01:16,465 --> 00:01:17,296
or nonsensical stuff.

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,420
But what's with that smile?

22
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,730
Something nice must have happened.

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,610
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

24
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,510
Ayaka, you look cuter.

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,860
Thanks.

26
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,170
What's with this outfit?

27
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,550
It's nothing.

28
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,290
Just felt like it.

29
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:41,180
Oh? Did you find someone you like?

30
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,840
No! This outfit is...

31
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,590
Hey.

32
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,620
You're being rude to Ayaka.

33
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:47,851
Hiroko-senpai.

34
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,320
Stop slacking and get back to work!

35
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,450
Sorry.

36
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,050
Thank you, Hiroko-senpai.

37
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,320
No problem.

38
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,400
But...

39
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,740
You look especially cute today, Ayaka.

40
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,900
Even I can't help but notice.

41
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,640
I...

42
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,335
wore this because I wanted

43
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,921
you to see it, Hiroko-senpai.

44
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,160
Huh?

45
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,610
Our office has a loose dress code.

46
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,897
Wearing what you like

47
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:27,420
makes you feel motivated.

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,610
See you later.

49
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,570
It didn't reach her.

50
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,010
That was close!

51
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,790
Oblivious straight people are scary!

52
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,450
"AYAKA is in LOVE with HIROKO"

53
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,520
"Episode 1: Don't fall
in love with the straights"

54
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,606
That day,

55
00:03:38,622 --> 00:03:40,481
I fell in love for the first time.

56
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,520
Hiroko-senpai!

57
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,030
What's going on, everyone?

58
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,490
Hiroko-senpai, I'm sorry.

59
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:51,737
Because of me...

60
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,200
Because of me the event...

61
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,170
Huh?

62
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,684
I don't know how

63
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,934
to take responsibility...

64
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,520
Huh?

65
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,470
Senpai?

66
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,840
- You're funny, Ayaka.
- Ah.

67
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:18,150
It's okay! It's okay!

68
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,960
Because I'm in charge of this,

69
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,000
so leave it to me.

70
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,170
But it's my fault...

71
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,440
Calm down.

72
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,170
Hiroko-senpai.

73
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,280
I know you're serious and hardworking.

74
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,170
Everyone does, so do I.

75
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,460
So it's okay.

76
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,490
Leave it to me.

77
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,730
Why is she being so kind to me?

78
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,010
What kind of person

79
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,510
is Hiroko-senpai?

80
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,310
(Bar Kiyoko
Women Only)

81
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,300
(Bar Kiyoko)

82
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,560
That straight girl is dangerous!

83
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,450
Haa...

84
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,049
Coming in looking so cute

85
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:20,156
in broad daylight...

86
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,180
Good morning, Hiroko-senpai!

87
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,270
- I bought new clothes.
- An off-the-shoulder top?

88
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,120
She keeps saying things

89
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:27,713
that give me the wrong idea!

90
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,720
I...

91
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,968
I wore this because I wanted

92
00:05:30,984 --> 00:05:32,445
you to see it, Hiroko-senpai.

93
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,370
Clothes she wants me to see?

94
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,160
I'll stare at them!

95
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:43,830
Haa...

96
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,801
I'm being led on by

97
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:47,270
an oblivious straight girl.

98
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,422
Isn't she a junior at your company?

99
00:05:52,447 --> 00:05:53,642
10 years younger?

100
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,640
Not 10 years. 13 years apart.

101
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,080
So she's 23?

102
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,119
There are couples with age gaps,

103
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:01,346
you should just date her.

104
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,230
No way.

105
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,712
Hiroko has decided not to

106
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:05,736
get involved with straight girls.

107
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,110
Huh? Really?

108
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,510
- The 'Ace' Hiroko?
- What's with the 'Ace'?

109
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,810
Well, when it comes to Hiroko-chan,

110
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,622
her first love started with
an upperclassman in middle school.

111
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,050
Excuse me!

112
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,650
Oh, a high schooler?

113
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,942
As soon as she turned 18,

114
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,910
she barged into a lesbian bar.

115
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,840
Welcome!

116
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,601
She achieved conquests with a

117
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:35,164
100 women at lesbian events,

118
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,731
meeting women through apps

119
00:06:53,756 --> 00:06:57,067
both domestically and internationally.

120
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,170
In sickness and in health,

121
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,010
she never stopped going after women.

122
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,550
Isn't she a hardcore lesbian?

123
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,702
You have nothing to worry

124
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:13,327
about with liking women.

125
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,460
- Hardcore indeed.
- Shut up!

126
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,527
Well, you've been busy with work

127
00:07:17,552 --> 00:07:19,075
these past few years,

128
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,000
so no time to play.

129
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,800
Exactly!

130
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,644
And that girl is definitely

131
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:26,349
only interested in men.

132
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,490
But if she's that flirtatious,

133
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,860
maybe even if she's a straight girl,

134
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,790
she might fall for you?

135
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,130
No way.

136
00:07:39,628 --> 00:07:41,368
The fact that she likes to approach me

137
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,210
must have been a generational gap?

138
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,010
Yeah, kids of that generation

139
00:07:46,027 --> 00:07:47,336
are more touchy-feely.

140
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,380
Exactly!

141
00:07:49,347 --> 00:07:51,437
It's just how the youth play these days.

142
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,760
Eh? No. You have to keep yourself warm.

143
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,810
- It's okay, it's okay.
- If she ever says,

144
00:07:56,294 --> 00:07:57,840
'Oh... it was just skinship, '

145
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,670
If she ever says that

146
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,100
I'd die of embarrassment!

147
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,030
I don't want to die like that.

148
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,132
Ugh...

149
00:08:06,163 --> 00:08:08,163
I don't want to be messed around with by

150
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:10,388
an oblivious straight girl again!

151
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,290
That outfit is just a makeover.

152
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,660
But how could she wear that?

153
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,351
With the shoulder part open,

154
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,609
if you pull it, it would pop!

155
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,460
Geez, Hiro-chan, you're too loud.

156
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,030
What should I wear tomorrow?

157
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,040
An off-the-shoulder top is a must!

158
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,150
Oh.

159
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:42,879
The next fashion event is for students?

160
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,800
Yeah.

161
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,980
Kids these days are so stylish.

162
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,620
It's great that they enjoy fashion.

163
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,090
But don't you think there are

164
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,240
(Number one hit)
a lot of revealing clothes lately?

165
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,500
(This summer, let's show off your skin)
a lot of revealing clothes lately?

166
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,250
(This summer, let's show off your skin)
Look, I couldn't wear them.

167
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,390
Look, I couldn't wear them.

168
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,779
We might not wear them,

169
00:08:58,795 --> 00:09:00,466
but they're cute.

170
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,390
I like clothes like that.

171
00:09:02,517 --> 00:09:03,677
Huh?

172
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,650
Look at this one.

173
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,380
- Huh? Is this a skirt?
- I don't know if this a skirt

174
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,700
or a top.

175
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,760
Which one is it?

176
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,190
These are the clothes senpai likes!

177
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,120
Okay, what else...

178
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,290
(A ranking of the items you want
your girlfriend to wear in the summer)

179

(Can't help falling in love...
Bare-legged mini skirts are a must)

180
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,480
Yeah...

181
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:33,880
Ah!

182
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,890
Bare legs!

183
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,600
Good morning, Risa.

184
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,390
Good morning, Ayaka.

185
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,830
You're wearing cute clothes again today.

186
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,840
- Good morning, everyone.
- Ah.

187
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,720
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Hiroko-senpai!

188
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,890
Ah! Wait!

189
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,268
I was just wearing this because

190
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:01,526
it's the product we're collaborating on.

191
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,740
Huh? Is it trending?

192
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,260
I like you, Hiroko-senpai,

193
00:10:04,277 --> 00:10:05,735
so I tried copying you!

194
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,800
- What's with you?

195
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,050
- I got one too.
- Huh?

196
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,990
I feel like I can work harder if

197
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,580
- I have the same one as Hiroko-senpai!
- That's not true at all.

198
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,420
- I have it too!
- Me too, me too!

199
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,880
- It can't be helped!
- Me too, me too!

200
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,630
Stop it, what are you doing?

201
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,170
- Huh? Even Yuya?
- I'll try my best.

202
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,620
- Seriously?
- Even he's wearing it.

203
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,720
- Oh, that looks a bit strange.
- As expected of Hiroko-senpai,

204
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,350
she's popular with both men and women.

205
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,514
As expected of

206
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,625
the ace of the sales department.

207
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,630
Huh?

208
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,340
Enough already.

209
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,340
What should I do?

210
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,460
It's so cool.

211
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,820
- It can do that?
- Right!

212
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,790
- It's quite convenient.
- I think it's great.

213
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,895
Whoa... What, what, what, what?

214
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,570
What, what, what?

215
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,560
Oh, Ayaka?

216
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,380
Senpai, I thought you might be tired.

217
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:18,106
Oh! Those puppy eyes...

218
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,410
Huh? Why?

219
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,830
You were rubbing your eyes this morning.

220
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,290
This morning?

221
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,360
Off-shoulder, mini skirt!

222
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,158
Oh!

223
00:11:34,174 --> 00:11:35,439
Lately, I've been having

224
00:11:35,464 --> 00:11:37,064
terrible eye strain.

225
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,150
What a relief!

226
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,800
I bought this for you, Hiroko-senpai.

227
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,010
A hot eye mask.

228
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,010
She subtly grabs my hand?

229
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,330
Oh, thank you.

230
00:11:47,952 --> 00:11:49,522
Ayaka, you're very observant.

231
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,130
Yes, I'm always watching.

232
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,580
Only you, senpai.

233
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,170
Take this! Caring junior appeal!

234
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,790
Please, understand my feelings!

235
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,420
W-what does she mean?

236
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,560
I'm happy!

237
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,490
- I'll go see the eye doctor tomorrow.
- Yes.

238
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:11,990
And this too!

239
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:13,110
Ah! Thank you!

240
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,190
Haa...

241
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,750
Love is so difficult.

242
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,898
Ah, dammit!

243
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:26,957
A straight girl made my heart race!

244
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,368
It's so easy to get hooked!

245
00:12:29,393 --> 00:12:31,415
It doesn't even take a second!

246
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:34,120
Maybe you're her 'oshi'?

247
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,564
Oh, 'oshi' is a term

248
00:12:35,572 --> 00:12:37,255
you hear a lot these days!

249
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,829
Misunderstanding that as love

250
00:12:38,838 --> 00:12:40,243
is too embarrassing.

251
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,806
I would never like you,

252
00:12:41,814 --> 00:12:43,126
not in a million years.

253
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,640
I don't want you either!

254
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,740
Well, firstly, Hiro-chan

255
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:51,105
keeps it a secret at work.

256
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,050
Oh, really?

257
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,910
Yeah, well.

258
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,244
How do you manage to keep it a secret

259
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:00,269
when you love women so much?

260
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,300
Well, a lot happened.

261
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,330
- Mama! Another round, please!
- Sure.

262
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,010
Haa...

263
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,100
- I think I drank too much.
- Hey, hey, sister.

264
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,710
She's got a good figure too.

265
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,440
- How annoying.
- Beg first.

266
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,320
- So cute.
- Can you please move?

267
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,390
- How about this?
- Let's ask her the important question.

268
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,600
- What cup size are you?
- Huh?

269
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,930
Hey, sister, what cup size are you?

270
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,510
- Stop it! I said cut it out!
- Tell us!

271
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,920
Okay, that's enough.

272
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,630
Huh? What's with this old lady?

273
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,630
- I'm not an old lady!
- Stop it!

274
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,593
It's not funny to point a camera

275
00:14:14,618 --> 00:14:16,591
at someone who doesn't like it.

276
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,117
Don't you know what's right

277
00:14:18,142 --> 00:14:19,262
and wrong yet?

278
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,820
- I'll remember this!
- Huh?

279
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,860
What? You're nice guys.

280
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,670
Shoo, shoo, shoo!

281
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,130
Dammit.

282
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,540
- Haa...
- Umm...

283
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,750
Thank you, Hiroko-senpai!

284
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,800
Ayaka?

285
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,090
Were you still out this late?

286
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,080
I was doing some shopping.

287
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,630
Huh?

288
00:15:06,342 --> 00:15:09,762
- Thank you for walking me home.
- No problem.

289
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,710
This is about all I can do for you.

290
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,820
You always help me, senpai.

291
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,010
Do I?

292
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,200
It makes me happy.

293
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:22,780
But...

294
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,239
Maybe dressing like this

295
00:15:26,264 --> 00:15:27,442
isn't good after all...

296
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,490
You look cute.

297
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,560
- Huh?
- It suits you really well.

298
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,175
It's not right that people say

299
00:15:37,191 --> 00:15:38,574
those things just because

300
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:39,831
you dress how you like.

301
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,510
Senpai...

302
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,730
Ayaka, you're not doing anything wrong.

303
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,670
I...

304
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,310
- I really like you, senpai.
- Huh?

305
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,660
I love that about you, senpai!

306
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,330
Thank you.

307
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,940
It means a lot to hear that.

308
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,567
As a senpai, being liked

309
00:16:18,592 --> 00:16:20,272
by juniors is everything.

310
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,550
- Huh?
- Yeah.

311
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,890
It's late. Get inside now.

312
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,410
Alright.

313
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,220
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you for your hard work.

314
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,270
That was close!

315
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,245
I almost mistook another straight girl's

316
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:48,756
misleading words as genuine!

317
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,530
(STOP)

318
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,690
I will embarrass myself to death again.

319
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,230
Senpai, you idiot!

320
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,670
Idiot, idiot!

321
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,810
(SAL Creative)

322
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,060
Hey, Ayaka.

323
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,353
Kumi-senpai and the others

324
00:17:07,377 --> 00:17:08,706
are going to karaoke. Want to come?

325
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,620
No, thanks.

326
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,470
Right, you don't like karaoke.

327
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,880
Yeah.

328
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,340
Heading home?

329
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,600
Oh, Hiroko.

330
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,580
We're going to karaoke. Want to join?

331
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,170
Oh. Sounds good. It's been a while.

332
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,870
- Great, let's go!
- Let's go!

333
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
- See you, Momo-chan!
- Yes, good job.

334
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,020
- Wait.
- Thank you for your hard work.

335
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,950
- Huh? I wonder if Ryo booked a room?
- Risa.

336
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,440

a past boyfriend's favorite?

363
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,430

she must have had a boyfriend before...

Really?

369
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,350
Ayaka, you're not good with alcohol.

370
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,000
It must be related.

00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:27,450

372
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:33,455

It's nice to be young.

379
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,620
That Iron Mask girl is totally into it.

380
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,630
She must have a crush on some guy.

381
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,355

Oh? Ayaka! Are you okay?

386
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,540
Huh?

387
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,950
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

388
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,190
Wait, what?

389
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,060
Oh!

390
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,040
Can I fall in love with you?

391
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,900
Can't it be me?

392
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,180
I'm serious!

393
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,910
I'm really in love with you!

394
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,800
(The Future of Aya, Hiro)

395
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,570
How to make our crush like us?

396
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,080
The important thing is to follow.

397
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,001
After that,

398
00:22:56,017 --> 00:22:57,345
it's even more important to

399
00:22:57,361 --> 00:22:58,326
observe them.

400
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,980
To make your senpai fall in love,

401
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,380
I need a plan.

402
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,921
Working outside of the office

403
00:23:03,937 --> 00:23:05,115
with just Hiroko-senpai?

404
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,085
This is your first time

405
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,066
working outside, right?

406
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,070
Yes.

407
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,300
But I won't cause trouble to my senpai.

408
00:23:10,317 --> 00:23:11,116
I'll try.

409
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,140
I want to follow senpai even further.

410
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,270
I'll do my best with everyone.

411
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:20,520
I insist on being beside my senpai.

412
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,840
Can we sleep holding hands?

413
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,550
Straights are really scary.

414
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,670
Ayaka is coming to the company event?

415
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,217
Think about what you want to do

416
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,248
or what you like and have fun doing it?

417
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,600
What I want to do...

418
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,317
Are you free on your day off?

419
00:23:34,342 --> 00:23:35,811
I'll buy you a new outfit.

420
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,442
Eh, Hiroko-senpai

421
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,286
is going to buy me a new outfit?

422
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,387
Meeting Ayaka outside of work

423
00:23:41,412 --> 00:23:43,092
feels very refreshing.

424
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,360
- Right.
- So cute.

425
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,260
Just this, today can already be fun.

426
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:49,890
Yes.

427
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:53,420
(This is a work of fiction)
How come it's like this? How?

428
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,820
I already did this much,

429
00:23:55,836 --> 00:23:57,617
why am I not reaching her yet?

430
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,937
(She's too slow)
