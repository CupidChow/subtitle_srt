1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:04,640
I'm sorry, Risa.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,290
I...

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,880
I can't date you, Risa.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,530
- But, Hiroko-senpai…
- She lied.

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,550
But I think there's a reason.

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,600
A reason?

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,640
I don't understand.

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,420
But I...

9
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,620
I want to know more about Hiroko-senpai.

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,872
I...

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,660
I really like Hiroko-senpai.

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,450
But, Risa...

13
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:47,610
Risa...

14
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,850
Could it be that...

15
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,860
you also like women?

16
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,420
Hiroko-senpai,

17
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,420
I need to talk to you.

18
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:26,850
Okay.

19
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,160
I understand.

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,060
I heard at the bar that

21
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,870
you like women, Hiroko-senpai.

22
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,500
Yes.

23
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,950
I heard.

24
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,235
That you've been going to

25
00:01:45,252 --> 00:01:46,696
lesbian bars for a long time,

26
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,920
dating many women casually, and that

27
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,635
you're a champion pick-up artist.

28
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,560
Oh, that's a bit exaggerated.

29
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,530
And

30
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,480
that you lied to Ayaka.

31
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,460
Ah…

32
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,440
I know about that too.

33
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,160
Why did you lie to Ayaka?

34
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,870
Why, you ask…

35
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:11,197
Because you didn't want

36
00:02:11,213 --> 00:02:12,228
to face her, right?

37
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,560
Until now,

38
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,169
Ayaka thought she couldn't

39
00:02:16,194 --> 00:02:17,474
convey her feelings because

40
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,583
she was so no good.

41
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,677
Even though she tried so hard

42
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:23,811
to express herself,

43
00:02:23,835 --> 00:02:25,768
it didn't reach you...

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,780
Hiroko-senpai...

45
00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:36,222
You didn't intend to face Ayaka, right?

46
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,380
I love Ayaka.

47
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:42,157
As a woman,

48
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,190
I'm in love with Ayaka as a woman!

49
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,050
But...

50
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,000
It couldn't be me!

51
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,830
Even if you lied,

52
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,268
for Ayaka,

53
00:03:00,284 --> 00:03:01,877
it has to be Hiroko-senpai only!

54
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,640
What am I saying?

55
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,600
It's not going to make a difference.

56
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,630
When you go out with a woman,

57
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,220
it's all about the body, isn't it?

58
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,599
As long as they have boobs,

59
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:17,418
it's all okay.

60
00:03:17,442 --> 00:03:19,820
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm not that bad.

61
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,560
There's no way a breast monster

62
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,120
would understand!

63
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,540
"A breast monster?"

64
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,470
What?

65
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,230
Huh?

66
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,930
Just now...

67
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,300
That means...

68
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,833
I wore this because I wanted you

69
00:03:38,858 --> 00:03:39,919
to see it, senpai!

70
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,880
Huh?

71
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,040
I'm always looking

72
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,350
at you, senpai.

73
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,760
I...

74
00:03:47,892 --> 00:03:49,372
Can I fall in love with you?

75
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,830
Please have this for lunch.

76
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,552
I want to receive compliments

77
00:03:52,568 --> 00:03:54,248
from the senior I like.

78
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,770
So I'm trying my best.

79
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,980
I'll keep it as an inheritance.

80
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,983
I realized again

81
00:03:57,999 --> 00:03:59,026
how much I like you, Hiroko-senpai.

82
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,440
Wait! Huh?

83
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,993
There's something

84
00:04:03,018 --> 00:04:04,448
I want to tell you now.

85
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,030
Hiroko-senpai!

86
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,690
Senpai!

87
00:04:07,785 --> 00:04:08,995
Senpai!

88
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,150
I...

89
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,670
really like you, Senpai.

90
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,110
It's me.

91
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,720
The one Ayaka likes

92
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,450
is me!

93
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,620
Ayaka has been telling me all along.

94
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,710
That she loves me.

95
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,020
But I…

96
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,620
assumed she was straight.

97
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,150
I didn't notice her feelings.

98
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,810
And lied about not being a lesbian.

99
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,070
I have to face

100
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,890
Ayaka properly.

101
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,880
"Ayaka is in Love with Hiroko"

102
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,800
(Episode 6: Therefore I won't give up.)

103
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,620
I...

104
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,390
I want you to be the next sales manager.

105
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,200
What, me?

106
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,040
Yes.

107
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,868
We nominated a candidate,

108
00:05:44,884 --> 00:05:46,176
and the vote was unanimous.

109
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,946
I'd feel reassured handing over

110
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:49,642
the baton to someone

111
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,070
as dedicated to their work as you.

112
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,500
And you're also highly trusted

113
00:05:53,525 --> 00:05:54,625
by your subordinates.

114
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,055
I want you to be

115
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,547
our first female sales manager

116
00:05:58,572 --> 00:05:59,790
in this company.

117
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,810
Well, during Chinatsu's time here,

118
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,560
it didn't happen.

119
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,570
Chinatsu-senpai.

120
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:11,510
I know you have your own circumstances,

121
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,915
so you don't have to decide right away.

122
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,430
Just think about it.

123
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,640
Yes.

124
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:18,640
Yeah.

125
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,360
Excuse me.

126
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,800
Oh, really?

127
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,890
- Do you always drink lattes?
- Yes, always.

128
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,800
Oh, Hiroko-senpai, good work!

129
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,360
Good work!

130
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,380
- Let's have lunch together tomorrow!
- Sure, sounds good!

131
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:37,036
Hiroko-senpai, please take me

132
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:38,026
golfing this weekend!

133
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,050
- It's still too early for you.
- Huh?

134
00:06:40,205 --> 00:06:41,935
Just kidding, I'll take you next time!

135
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,750
Thank you!

136
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,770
In reality,

137
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,944
if I'm really trusted by

138
00:06:47,952 --> 00:06:49,232
my subordinates,

139
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,180
It's because of the lies I've built up

140
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,300
over the years.

141
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,730
Risa.

142
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,470
Umm... Ayaka,

143
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,890
are you almost done with work?

144
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:39,900
Almost..

145
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,580
Umm... Well...

146
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,330
Umm...

147
00:07:47,018 --> 00:07:49,090
You see...

148
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,610
Ayaka, Risa, good work.

149
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,850
Good work.

150
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,940
I got this earlier.

151
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,400
It's a place near the station.

152
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,479
If you're free, why don't

153
00:07:58,495 --> 00:07:59,588
you two go together?

154
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,830
Thank you!

155
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,440
You mean, me and Risa?

156
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:06,720
Ah...

157
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,290
But aren't you two friends?

158
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,370
Friends?

159
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,060
Ah, sorry.

160
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,930
Ayaka doesn't seem to think so...

161
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,020
You

162
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,080
think of me

163
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,980
as a friend?

164
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:27,540
Yes.

165
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,320
I want to get closer to you.

166
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,340
I'm happy.

167
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,983
This is the first time

168
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:37,359
I've ever had a friend.

169
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,670
Can we exchange

170
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,690
contact info later?

171
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,160
Sure.

172
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:48,107
I'll go get ready to leave!

173
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,400
Ayaka.

174
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:54,960
I...

175
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,490
thought you two fit well together.

176
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,530
Huh?

177
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,060
You two should talk more.

178
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,470
You'll become better friends.

179
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,780
(Komai Risa)

180
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,230
(The meeting will be postponed to
2 p.m. tomorrow.)

181
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,320
(Got it)

182
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,256
Even though she found out

183
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:26,671
her junior likes her,

184
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,970
she still doesn't seem happy.

185
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,050
Don't make a sad face. It is annoying.

186
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,390
I can hear you, you two.

187
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,550
We're talking loud for you to hear!

188
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,390
Now, now, no fighting.

189
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,310
Geez. Why are you so down?

190
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,294
Even if your secret leaked out

191
00:09:43,303 --> 00:09:44,277
in the office,

192
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:45,583
the girl who you kept saying

193
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:47,550
she was straight turned out not to be.

194
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,080
There's no problem.

195
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,500
You...

196
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,970
Lying to yourself about your feelings,

197
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,660
what are you protecting?

198
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,120
What a relief

199
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,920
that you came.

200
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,330
What is you want to talk about?

201
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:19,860
Well...

202
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,160
Risa,

203
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,600
you've always been with me,

204
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,970
and you've always cared about me.

205
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,100
To me,

206
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,720
you're very important.

207
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,100
Ayaka.

208
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,290
But…

209
00:10:43,812 --> 00:10:46,010
I still like Hiroko-senpai.

210
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,400
But...

211
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,030
I don't want to lose you, Risa.

212
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,940
It's really selfish,

213
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,420
I'm sorry...

214
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,330
But...

215
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,860
But I want to be friends

216
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,750
with you forever, Risa.

217
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,260
Even though you don't like me,

218
00:11:39,248 --> 00:11:40,334
but why are you crying

219
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,467
for someone like me?

220
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,970
You've always been totally fine

221
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,150
with being alone.

222
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,490
Even if...

223
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,500
it might take time,

224
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,310
but I...

225
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,710
I want to be friends with you too.

226
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,270
I want to spend a lot of time,

227
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,440
face each other,

228
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,730
and talk a lot.

229
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,420
Ayaka.

230
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,490
Risa.

231
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,240
Please make up with me!

232
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,810
Hiroko-senpai

233
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,900
haven't said anything to you yet?

234
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,840
Huh?

235
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:50,350
Yeah.

236
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,680
I...

237
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:54,517
I've already spoken to Hiroko-senpai

238
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,210
about her lying,

239
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,005
which is probably because

240
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:00,466
she doesn't want to face you.

241
00:13:01,674 --> 00:13:04,384
If Hiroko-senpai said that,

242
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,520
she must have had a reason for it.

243
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,850
I want to know.

244
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,090
Then, let's ask someone who knows her.

245
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,890
Huh?

246
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,710
I'll go with you.

247
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,990
I'll support your love…

248
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,370
Because we're friends.

249
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,400
Thank you, Risa.

250
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:33,590
Let's go get ready.

251
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,860
Goodbye...

252
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:46,690
My unrequited love.

253
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,900
Welcome.

254
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,440
Oh?

255
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,910
The reason Hiro-chan lies...

256
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:08,210
I think Hiroko-senpai has her reasons.

257
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,660
Mama

258
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,610
if you know anything, please tell me.

259
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,610
A long time ago,

260
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,890
there was a senior

261
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,440
who quit the company

262
00:14:29,465 --> 00:14:31,145
to protect Hiro-chan.

263
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,660
Huh?

264
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,230
(Otori Chinatsu)

265
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,780
Chinatsu-senpai.

266
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,870
(My One Fair)

267
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,230
(Summer 2014
Regional Restoration Project)

268
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,930
(A new project proposal)

269
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,340
It's fine. I'll handle it...

270
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,697
Then, tell the client that.

271
00:15:04,713 --> 00:15:06,056
I'll head over there soon.

272
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,110
Yes. Understood.

273
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,150
Senpai.

274
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,890
- I chose this, but...
- Yes, here.

275
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,930
- Thank you.
- Please check this.

276
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,980
Chinatsu-senpai is amazing.

277
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,880
- She handles big projects by herself.
- This is good.

278
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,984
I hear she's being considered

279
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:23,196
for the next sales manager.

280
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,650
Whoa! You scared me!

281
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,660
Yuya!

282
00:15:29,716 --> 00:15:31,161
Hiroko, you really like

283
00:15:31,186 --> 00:15:32,866
Chinatsu-senpai, huh?

284
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,110
Chinatsu-senpai

285
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,260
was the most capable

286
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,490
and coolest person.

287
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,290
Hiroko!

288
00:15:46,481 --> 00:15:47,499
The project you came up

289
00:15:47,524 --> 00:15:48,776
with is likely to get approved!

290
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,340
Huh?

291
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,820
Let's make it a success!

292
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,410
Yes.

293
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,860
So I didn't notice...

294
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,057
that someone was

295
00:15:59,073 --> 00:16:00,436
watching Chinatsu-senpai

296
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,880
with ill intentions.

297
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:09,970
Yes,

298
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,360
it looks good.

299
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,500
You've really grown, Hiroko.

300
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,480
Thank you!

301
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,860
Umm...

302
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,280
Dan I ask you something?

303
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:24,640
Hmm?

304
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,160
My feelings

305
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,570
for you, Chinatsu-senpai,

306
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,817
did it reach you?

307
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,740
Hiroko's feelings...

308
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,550
I understand it well.

309
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:06,730
Huh?

310
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:21,052
Chinatsu and Hiroko...

311
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,520
they seem suspicious, right?

312
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,140
Yeah.

313
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,350
They're those folks.

314
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,420
- Huh?
- Huh?

315
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,940
You mean they're homosexuals?

316
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,100
Seriously?

317
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,330
I heard Chinatsu got that big project

318
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,020
was because she was sleeping

319
00:17:32,036 --> 00:17:33,465
with the female president.

320
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,950
Sleeping her way up the ladder?

321
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,480
Getting promoted so quickly

322
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,996
in a male-dominated company,

323
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:39,356
so it was because of this.

324
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,490
She'll do anything for work.

325
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,470
I suppose so.

326
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,960
That's what I heard.

327
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,110
I don't care about those lies.

328
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,330
It's okay.

329
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,080
So, Hiroko's the same?

330
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,276
Maybe she's trying to do

331
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,165
the same thing as Chinatsu.

332
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,290
At that moment,

333
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,250
Those women...

334
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,620
- like to suck their way up.
- I didn't understand

335
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,117
Chinatsu-senpai was the person who could

336
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:03,921
think of others more than anyone else.

337
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,960
That she's the one who thinks about me

338
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,980
more than herself.

339
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,619
Chinatsu has been taking

340
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:14,706
a lot of time off.

341
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,350
Yeah.

342
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:17,556
Maybe they found out about her

343
00:18:17,572 --> 00:18:19,516
affair with the female president.

344
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,220
Huh?

345
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,500
Isn't Hiroko the same?

346
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,460
Someone saw them holding hands often.

347
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,080
Doing that at work.

348
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,150
"Forbidden love," huh?

349
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,430
Wow...

350
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,490
What are you saying?

351
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,020
I can't take this anymore!

352
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,130
Hiroko.

353
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,480
Chinatsu-senpai.

354
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,520
I'm sorry.

355
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,420
Huh?

356
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,480
Because of me, you're suffering.

357
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,310
"Because of me?"

358
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,190
It's okay.

359
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,950
I'll protect you, no matter what.

360
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,860
Chinatsu-senpai?

361
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,260
At the end of that day,

362
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,366
it was announced that

363
00:19:05,398 --> 00:19:07,038
Chinatsu-senpai had resigned.

364
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,690
(Otori Chinatsu)

365
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,690
(Calling Otori Chinatsu)

366
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,420
The number you have dialed

367
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,232
is not in service.

368
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,780
Please recheck...

369
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,010
Hiroko.

370
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:31,430
Did you hear?

371
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,899
The rumors about Chinatsu-senpai

372
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,124
were all lies.

373
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,470
People entered work at the same time

374
00:19:40,502 --> 00:19:41,556
to spread rumors because

375
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,586
they didn't like her.

376
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,260
You were caught up in it too.

377
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,989
Rumors about a lesbian love triangle

378
00:19:46,005 --> 00:19:47,045
and all that.

379
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:48,750
It's terrible.

380
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,498
There's no way someone as busy as

381
00:19:50,514 --> 00:19:51,607
Chinatsu-senpai had time

382
00:19:51,616 --> 00:19:52,810
to sleep with someone.

383
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,100
The one that Hiroko admired,

384
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,240
isn't that kind of person.

385
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,943
It must've been awful for you, dealing

386
00:19:58,952 --> 00:20:01,021
with those baseless rumors, right?

387
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,470
You weren't happy, right?

388
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,600
It's not entirely baseless.

389
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,010
I finally understood why

390
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,320
Chinatsu-senpai resigned.

391
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,910
Chinatsu-senpai

392
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,230
was protecting me.

393
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,610
Thanks, everyone.

394
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,120
All I can do now is...

395
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,100
live at the company

396
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,242
as normally as I can,

397
00:20:28,258 --> 00:20:29,938
and not waste the chance

398
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,680
Chinatsu-senpai gave me.

399
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,420
I knew it.

400
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,370
I...

401
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,110
No way.

402
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,790
Why?

403
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,655
Why should someone have to quit

404
00:20:49,664 --> 00:20:51,326
their job because they like women?

405
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,040
I agree,

406
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,610
but

407
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,390
there was a time when society

408
00:20:57,406 --> 00:20:58,554
was much harsher

409
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,120
and more prejudiced

410
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,670
than you think.

411
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,950
That's why Hiro-chan

412
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,380
has been working desperately

413
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,250
while hiding the truth

414
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,490
ever since that incident.

415
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,430
So...

416
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,499
the reason Senpai can't respond

417
00:21:18,515 --> 00:21:20,256
to my feelings is because she's afraid

418
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,775
I won't be able to stay at the company

419
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
if it's revealed. Right?

420
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,580
That's what she thought, right?

421
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,358
Hiro-chan's thinking

422
00:21:28,382 --> 00:21:30,350
might old-fashioned.

423
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,061
She probably believes that if she

424
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:36,419
has more power within the company,

425
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,400
she can protect her subordinates

426
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,665
from going through

427
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:42,361
the same sadness she did.

428
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,340
She's probably thinking that.

429
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,320
I see…

430
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,360
If it's you two,

431
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,910
I have a feeling you two can change

432
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,330
Hiro-chan's difficult life.

433
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,260
I...

434
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,200
I've made up my mind.

435
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,580
I...

436
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,460
Hiroko-senpai, I love!

437
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,950
- Huh?
- Huh?

438
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,630
Huh?

439
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:45,720
(Next episode)

440
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,680
I'll do my best,

441
00:23:46,712 --> 00:23:47,806
please prepare yourself.

442
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,290
- A public confession?
- A public confession?

443
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,477
Doing that in front of others

444
00:23:50,486 --> 00:23:51,636
must have some meaning.

445
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,660
The fight has only just begun.

446
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,609
Not everyone expresses their

447
00:23:55,617 --> 00:23:57,326
congratulations sincerely.

448
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,390
I won't give up on Hiroko-senpai.
