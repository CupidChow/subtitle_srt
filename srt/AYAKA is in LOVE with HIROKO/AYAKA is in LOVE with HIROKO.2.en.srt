Huh?

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,160

Um, senpai.

Still into that otome game, huh?

73
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,969
There’s no character

74
00:04:31,977 --> 00:04:33,657
I can’t capture now.

75
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,406
Now I can give advice on

76
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,640

00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,510

79

Even a game can boost

80
00:04:43,555 --> 00:04:45,235
your confidence so much.

81
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,391
How can I capture the person I like?

82
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,810
- Huh?
- That startled me.

83
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,300
When did you get here?

84
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,580
Oh, are you interested too, Ayaka?

85
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,909
Yes. How can I capture

86
00:04:56,925 --> 00:04:58,496
the heart of the person I like?

87
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,070
Ah, we're just talking about a game.

88
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,640
I knew it!

89
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,990
The key is to

90
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,040
make them see you in a new light!

91
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,045
Show them your potential

92
00:05:08,053 --> 00:05:09,435
and surprise them!

93
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,550
Got it!

94
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,230
After that...

95
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,200
skinship!

96
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,700
Physical touch to make their heart race!

97
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,350
I never thought of that before!

98
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,340
But above all,

99
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,870
observe them closely!

100
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,000
Observe them?

101
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,130
Thank you. I'll take your advice.

102
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,850
Yeah, do your best, Ayaka!

103
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:35,520
Yes!

104
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,760
Geez...

105
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,179
I never thought Ayaka

106
00:05:46,187 --> 00:05:47,867
was into otome games.

107
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,920
No, I seriously doubt that.

108
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,070
Alright, then...

109
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,140
What should I do next?

110
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,600
Is she really going to be okay?

112
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,920
In order to capture Senpai's heart,

113
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:02,498
I need a strategy!

120

121

It's impossible at this rate.

122
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,200
Ayaka, what's wrong?

123
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,660
That's a lot of documents.

124
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,900

127
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,560
- so I'm studying up.
- Oh!

128
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,730
You're as dedicated as ever.

129
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,740
But it's not coming together well.

130
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,520
Right, Yuya-senpai,

131
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,580
could you give me some advice?

132
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,550
Sure, if you're okay with it.

133
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,610

Yes.

136
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,460
Yes! I'm on fire right now!

137

how can I make it more understandable?

142

I want you to check this proposal.

148
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,110
Of course.

Ayaka, you put in a lot of effort.

160

Did she notice me in a new light?

161
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,210
You worked hard with Yuya, didn't you?

162
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,220
Yes! Yuya-senpai gave me lots of advice.

163

164
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:15,982
invite him out for dinner.

165
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,320
Huh?

Senpai, are you tired?

170
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,850
Oh, Ayaka.

171
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,310
Yeah I guess so,

172
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,708
my shoulders are so stiff.

173
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,350
Ah.

174
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,300
Senpai, can I give you a massage?

175
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,250

00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:30,625
I'm really good at massages!

190
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,290
- Really?
- Excuse me.

191
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:32,990
Wait!

192
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,517
Whoa!

193
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,900
Hiroko-senpai's shoulders

194
00:09:35,924 --> 00:09:37,124
are like rocks?

195
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,380
Oh? A massage?

196
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,680
I'm super strong!

197
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,480
- Really?
- Let me handle it.

198
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,230
- Wait, I...
- I've got this.

199
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,520
Whoa! Is this real?

200
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,850
A massage?

201
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,400
Seems like you need more strength.

202
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,880
- Gee, it can't be help, allow me.
- Should have better strength.

203
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,450
- Come, come.
- Alright! Let's go.

204
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,450
- Wait.
- Huh?

205
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,690
- So hard!
- I will massage...

206
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,790
- Let me do it...
- Is this part real?

207
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,700
- A massage is needed.
- Everyone, keep it up!

208
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,450
I lost.

209
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,028
Wow, thanks to everyone,

210
00:10:15,052 --> 00:10:17,145
my shoulders feel so much better!

211
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,330
Haa!

212
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,090
Thank you all!

213
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,340
- Wow! Amazing!
- That's great!

214
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,640
Thank you very much.

215
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,410
Thank you very much.

216
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,100
- What a relief.
- Absolutely.

217
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,390
That's great.

218
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,300
Haa...

219
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,890
It's not going well...

220
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,540
But above all,

221
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,380
observe them closely!

222
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,490
Observation, huh...

223
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,070
Yes, that's right.

224
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,230
Understood.

225
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,750
Three days from now, got it.

226
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,140
Yes, sorry.

227
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,940
Thank you.

228
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,860
- Hiroko.
- Haa...

229
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:05,939
Dinner's at 7 PM at
the place near the station.

230
00:11:05,964 --> 00:11:07,340
Oh, right.

231
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,320
A lot of dinners lately.

232
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,460
Yeah, but you know,

233
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,751
I haven't had a nice,

234
00:11:13,775 --> 00:11:15,295
cozy meal at home recently.

235
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,690
Ah, right, me too.

236
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,700
Ayaka, you're not leaving yet?

237
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,620
Risa, how to make a bento box?

238
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,810
Huh?

239
00:11:28,075 --> 00:11:30,055
You're only capable of boiling water.

240
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,620
I'm only capable of boiling water.

241
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,760
But I want to make one

242
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,127
for someone I like.

243
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,390
Please Risa, teach me.

244
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:41,980
Alright.

245
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,380
Thanks.

246
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,610
Alright.

247
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:51,780
Haa...

248
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,350
Alright.

249
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,420
Whoo...

250
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,584
Hiroko-senpai's heart capture,

251
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,576
mission 3,

252
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,500
bento box.

253
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,350
(Hiroko-senpai's heart capture,
mission 3)

254
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,200
(bento box)

255
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,790
(How to make karaage)

256
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,500
She ate a lot of karaage at karaoke,

257
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,470
so she must like it...

258
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,610
Besides...

259
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,920
Ayaka, you're good at cooking.

260
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,450
I made it with all my
heart for you, Senpai!

261
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,300
Ahh...

262
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,550
Mmm.

263
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,060
It's delicious with so much love.

264
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,450
It's like a love bento from a wife.

265
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,230
Senpai!

266
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Take that.

267
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,910
Alright, let's do this!

268
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:25,670
Here you go.

269
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,330
Thanks, Mama.

270
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,625
How's it going with

271
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,906
that junior of yours?

272
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,630
Mmm...

273
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,880
She's still making me misunderstand,

274
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,270
but she's working hard every day.

275
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,970
Huh?

276
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,770
That's nice.

277
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,210
Mmm.

278
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,657
Well, sometimes she's acting

279
00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:49,485
weirdly close, though.

280
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,370
Maybe she really likes you?

281
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,790
No way, no way.

282
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,960
I'm serious!

283
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,490
I'm really in love with you!

284
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,340
No.

285
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,380
I don't think so.

286
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,000
Huh?

287
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,660
Huh?

288
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,110
Huh?

289
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,691
No matter how it's peeled,

290
00:14:24,716 --> 00:14:26,238
it's still a an onion?

291
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:30,070
Dark matter?

292
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:35,850
Whoa!

293
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,410
The eggs exploded?

294
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,780
Huh?

295
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:40,820
Huh?

296
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,360
Thanks to Risa's recipe,

297
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,030
the taste is okay...

298
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,320
but...

299
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,640
This appearance is not okay.

300
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,700
No time to start over.

301
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,160
(If it doesn't look good, just cut some
seaweed into cute shapes!)

302
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,570
Risa...

303
00:15:50,386 --> 00:15:51,330
Done!

304
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,290
(SAL Creative)
Hiroko-senpai.

305
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,640
(SAL Creative)

306
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,240
Good morning.

307
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,700
Good morning.

308
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,700
- Hiroko-senpa...
- Hiroko-senpai! We have a problem.

309
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,110
- What happened?
- Are you free now?

310
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,830
- Yes, I am.
- Let's go to the conference room.

311
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,700
- What's going on?
- This way.

312
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,750
- Is it scary?
- No.

313
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,140
It's scary.

314
00:16:14,476 --> 00:16:17,910
This time... Hiroko-senpai.

315
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,530
- Ah! Hiroko-senpa...
- Sorry, Hiroko.

316
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,750
Can we reschedule the meeting planned

317
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:25,286
for this afternoon to now?

318
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,250
Sure, no problem.

319
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,070
- Thanks.
- What is it?

320
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,603
Apparently, they're into

321
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:30,900
coming in the early morning now.

322
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:31,906
Whoa! Saruta-san?

323
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,180
It's too early.

324
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,480
Sorry for changing the time.

325
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,980
It's fine.

326
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,670
Haa...

327
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,680
Oh, by the way,

328
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,001
what’s that girl's name

329
00:16:45,018 --> 00:16:46,376
who submitted the project?

330
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,420
- Oh, Ayaka-chan?
- Yes, yes.

331
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,680
Her project was quite good.

332
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,100
Right? I thought so too.

333
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:53,950
Yeah.

334
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,580
But she doesn't smile much, does she?

335
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,160
- Can she handle sales?
- She's fine.

336
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,230
She may look a bit clumsy,

337
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:07,045
but she's very serious and capable.

338
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,180
- I see,
- Yes.

339
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,320
that’s good to hear.

340
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,820
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

341
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,280
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

342
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,480
Yuya, you understand Ayaka well.

343
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,470
Really? I think everyone does.

344
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,180
- Hiroko-senpai!
- Oh!

345
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,984
There's been equipment trouble

346
00:17:35,008 --> 00:17:36,436
at the Hiratsuka Park event.

347
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,870
Oh no! Really?

348
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,170
- I'll go then.
- Yes, I'll go first.

349
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,130
Yes.

350
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,090
Ahh, today is so hectic.

351
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,190
- Hiroko-senpai!
- Oh... Ayaka!

352
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,610
Umm... Here, I made this bento box.

353
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,320
- Please eat it for lunch!
- Huh? For me?

354
00:18:13,573 --> 00:18:14,355
Yes.

355
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,150
I heard you’ve been eating out a lot.

356
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,070
And only having jelly for lunch.

357
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,580
Huh? I'm glad.

358
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,650
Thank you, Ayaka.

359
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,760
Yes.

360
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:27,510
Well, I'm off then!

361
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,610
Have a good day.

362
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,170
At last...

363
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,340
Mission

364
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,140
accomplished!

365
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,880
Ready, set, lift!

366
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,940
- Alright.
- Haa...

367
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,600
It's alright, I can handle this.

368
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,560
Ah, we're really sorry.

369
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,030
It's no problem.

370
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,900
- Thank you.
- It's alright.

371
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,740
Thank you.

372
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,020
- Thanks again.
- Ah, yes.

373
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,570
- Haa...
- Haa...

374
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,660
I'm exhausted.

375
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,750
Thanks, Risa.

376
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:13,764
No problem.

377
00:19:13,788 --> 00:19:15,496
You worked hard too, Hiroko-senpai.

378
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,990
Thanks for your hard work.

379
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,840
Alright, since we solved the problem.

380
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,290
It might be late but let's have lunch.

381
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,290
Yes.

382
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,720
Huh That's rare! A bento box?

383
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,950
Yes, Ayaka made it for me.

384
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,410
- Huh? Ayaka?
- Yeah.

385
00:19:41,962 --> 00:19:43,072
It's cute.

386
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,280
She worked hard on this.

387
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,990
Bon appétit.

388
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,660
Mmm...

389
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,210
It's tasty.

390
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,880
Geez...

391
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,350
I haven't had a homemade bento in ages.

392
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,270
Mmm!

393
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,790
The karaage is delicious!

394
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,647
Oh,

395
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:19,271
Yuya-senpai also said he likes karaage.

396
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,910
That's great.

397
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:30,254
Yuya-senpai gave me lots of advice.

398
00:20:30,705 --> 00:20:32,370
If your proposal gets approved,

399
00:20:32,394 --> 00:20:34,095
invite him take out for dinner.

400
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,380
She may look a bit clumsy,

401
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,210
but she's very serious and capable.

402
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,210
Oh, I see...

403
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,110
The one she likes is Yuya.

404
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,890
So this was just practice.

405
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,000
How dangerous.

406
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,780
It knew it was just a misunderstanding.

407
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,508
I'll never be hurt from

408
00:21:10,524 --> 00:21:11,797
misunderstanding again.

409
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,520
Even though, I said that...

410
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,890
Senpai, this feels great!

411
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,440
Ow, that's hot...

412
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,300
Senpai, your turn for the shower.

413
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,550
How did this happen?

414
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,110
How did this really happen!

415
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,510
(Next episode)
Working outside of the office

416
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,790
with just Hiroko-senpai?

417
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,868
Even if she couldn't see,

418
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:34,876
I'll wear my best lingerie.

419
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,938
This is your first time

420
00:23:35,954 --> 00:23:36,946
working outside, right?

421
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:37,550
Yes.

422
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,446
But I won't cause trouble to senpai.

423
00:23:39,462 --> 00:23:40,546
I'll do my best.

424
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,550
I want to follow senpai even further.

425
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,580
I'll work hard with everyone.

426
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,950
Ayaka, you've changed.

427
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,230
I'll lead you to a double bed room.

428
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,030
Can you help apply it on my back?

429
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,030
Oblivious straight people are scary!

430
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,540
Want to go together?
