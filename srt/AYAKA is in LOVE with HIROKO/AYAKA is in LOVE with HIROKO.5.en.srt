1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,110
(10 Years Ago)

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,679
I thought this was

3
00:00:05,695 --> 00:00:08,312
a place where I can confirm my identity.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,430
Hey, hey, want to have a drink together?

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:21,740
Sure!

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:24,980
Here,

7
00:00:25,877 --> 00:00:26,854
I don't have to hide

8
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:27,816
anything from anyone.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,350
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

10
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,438
Here, I can be honest with myself.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,420
- What's your name?
- Shuri.

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,650
- Shuri-chan.
- Yes.

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,420
I...

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,180
Or so I thought.

15
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,510
Hiroko-senpai?

16
00:00:42,298 --> 00:00:43,278
Ayaka.

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:44,930
Oh,

18
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,250
do you two know each other?

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,560
Hiroko-senpai.

20
00:00:53,062 --> 00:00:54,352
Please wait!

21
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,810
Why is Hiroko-senpai…

22
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,490
- Hiroko-senpai!
- Huh?

23
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,990
Senpai, why are you running away?

24
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:11,520
Huh?

25
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,090
No.

26
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,800
Ayaka, why were you at that bar?

27
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,680
That's because…

28
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,430
Were you dragged in?

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,630
You might not know,

30
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,460
but that bar isn't just a regular bar.

31
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,420
I know!

32
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,670
I knew and I went.

33
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:31,410
Huh?

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,410
I like women!

35
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:37,600
Huh?

36
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,730
You like women...

37
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,500
- Yuya-senpai gave me a lot of advice…
- No.

38
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,310
It's fine, it's just water.

39
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,020
No, please come with me.

40
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,900
She didn't like Yuya?

41
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,300
Hiroko-senpai.

42
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,430
I have something I need to tell you now.

43
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,390
Actually...

44
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,060
Actually I...

45
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,680
Ah, wait!

46
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,580
Ayaka, are you okay?

47
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,490
Ayaka!

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,840
Are you okay?

49
00:02:15,284 --> 00:02:16,854
I feel sick…

50
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,270
This is why you shouldn't drink so much

51
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:20,809
when you can't handle it.

52
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,540
You see...

53
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,957
I was the one who invited

54
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:28,502
Ayaka to that bar.

55
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,440
Huh?

56
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,909
This is my first time

57
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:35,192
that I fell in love with a woman.

58
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,820
The thing Ayaka wanted to tell me…

59
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,040
is that she's dating Risa?

60
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,980
Hiroko-senpai, why…

61
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,830
Wait! Ayaka!

62
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,120
"Ayaka is in Love with Hiroko"

63
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,010
"Episode 5
Because I fell in love with you"

64
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,240
(Komai Risa:
I've sent Ayaka home safely)

65
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,940
What a relief. But...

66
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,950
They weren't straight?

67
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,970
Huh? Seriously?

68
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,460
I was sure she was straight.

69
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,960
Can this even happen?

70
00:04:03,237 --> 00:04:05,410
No, right? Huh? Or is it?

71
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,570
But she's dating Risa…

72
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,921
I wore this because I wanted you

73
00:04:15,929 --> 00:04:17,202
to see it, Hiroko-senpai.

74
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,290
I...

75
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,207
Want to receive compliments

76
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:21,465
from the senior I like.

77
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,250
So I'm trying my best.

78
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,920
In any case,

79
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,800
I was completely mistaken, huh?

80
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,270
But...

81
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,060
But if she likes women...

82
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,540
Can't it be me?

83
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,220
No.

84
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,099
Ayaka and I are just

85
00:04:44,107 --> 00:04:45,310
boss and subordinate.

86
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,060
And besides,

87
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,320
I absolutely can't let my secret out.

88
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,530
Oh, Ayaka?

89
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,280
What's wrong?

90
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,730
What's with the warrior stance?

91
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,920
Hiroko-senpai…

92
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,082
I have something to ask you

93
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,129
about yesterday.

94
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,530
Oh, are you feeling okay now?

95
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,080
- I'm fine.
- Good, then.

96
00:05:16,147 --> 00:05:17,697
What I want to ask is…

97
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,110
Why were you at that bar?

98
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,657
That's right! We have a meeting

99
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:23,746
first thing this morning!

100
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,180
I totally forgot,

101
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,200
okay!

102
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,330
Let's work for our health.

103
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,280
Thank you.

104
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,910
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

105
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,080
Please handle the scheduling over there.

106
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,540
- Yes, I'll take care of it.
- Yes.

107
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,130
- Senpai!
- Whoa! A ninja?

108
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,415
I have something to ask

109
00:05:40,431 --> 00:05:41,486
you about yesterday.

110
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,800
Ah! That's right!

111
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,336
I have plans with Yuya

112
00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:45,235
right after this!

113
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:46,046
Sorry!

114
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,110
Yuya?

115
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,970
Alright, I'm heading out.

116
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,970
- Ah. Thanks for your hard work.
- Thanks for your hard work.

117
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,260
Whoa!

118
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,390
Senpai.

119
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,520
I need to talk to you.

120
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,070
Ah, alright.

121
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,289
Ayaka-san, you don't need

122
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:20,756
to stand guard like that.

123
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,610
But Senpai, you keep trying to run away.

124
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,790
Running away?

125
00:06:24,815 --> 00:06:26,524
People who do that are terrible.

126
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,620
Hiroko-senpai,

127
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,665
you remember what I said

128
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,050
yesterday, right?

129
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,940
What you said yesterday?

130
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,690
I like women!

131
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,330
Ummm...

132
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,159
Hiroko-senpai,

133
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:44,864
why were you at that bar?

134
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,580
You knew it was a lesbian bar

135
00:06:49,604 --> 00:06:51,404
and you went there, right?

136
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,620
That is...

137
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,750
Could it be that...

138
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,940
you also like women?

139
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,280
I...

140
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,200
Because I'll always protect you, Hiroko.

141
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,790
I...

142
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,570
I'm not a lesbian.

143
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,060
Huh?

144
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,400
I happened to be nearby and wandered in.

145
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,660
Then Mama invited me in.

146
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,040
I had no idea what kind of place it was,

147
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,120
but I hit it off with the patrons

148
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,520
and now I'm a regular.

149
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,600
Is that so?

150
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,520
Yeah.

151
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,225
I don't really understand

152
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:52,913
the relationships between females,

153
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,240
but I think love should be free.

154
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,640
I support your relationship.

155
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:00,990
Do your best.

156
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,460
- No way. How?
- Right?

157
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,500
Ah, welcome.

158
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,410
Oh, it's you from the other day.

159
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,896
What's up, Risapon?

160
00:08:26,904 --> 00:08:28,584
Are you here to see me?

161
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,850
Risapon? You're getting friendly fast.

162
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,849
That girl was called Ayaka-chan, right?

163
00:08:34,873 --> 00:08:36,606
She's not with you today?

164
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,640
No. Today, it's just me.

165
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,390
Speaking of which, that kid...

166
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,650
Seemed to know Hiro-chan.

167
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,050
Umm, this "Hiro-chan" is...

168
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,860
the 'Ace' everyone was talking about?

169
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,540
Oh, yeah,

170
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,610
that's our ace, Hiroko.

171
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,815
As long as there are boobs,

172
00:08:57,823 --> 00:08:59,072
she's okay with anyone!

173
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,500
She's a boob monster.

174
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,840
That's in the past.

175
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,900
But she has become more mature lately.

176
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,020
Well, I'm still higher ranked than her.

177
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,930
Such a petty rank competition.

178
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,480
My, you're good at drinking.

179
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,740
Liking women…

180
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,336
It's not something to be
ashamed of, right?

181
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,540
Of course not.

182
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,100
You can't hunt good prey if you're shy.

183
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,770
You're overstating.

184
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,400
I knew it.

185
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,266
Even though, it shouldn't be

186
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,337
something to hide.

187
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,780
Haa...

188
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,240
It's not convenient.

189
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,920
And there was a mention of my ex too.

190
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,720
But...

191
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,790
Ah, right.

192
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,530
Yeah.

193
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,454
How about this? Isn't this chic?

194
00:10:02,463 --> 00:10:03,823
Like this, bam.

195
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,212
I don't really understand

196
00:10:06,236 --> 00:10:08,056
the relationships between females,

197
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,520
but I think love should be free.

198
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,920
I support your relationship.

199
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,130
Ayaka.

200
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,570
Today, do you have a moment?

201
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,870
I need to talk to you.

202
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,280
Hmm?

203
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,010
So, what did you want to talk about?

204
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,000
Hiroko-senpai…

205
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,570
is lying.

206
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,680
Huh?

207
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,280
Sorry,

208
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,580
I overheard you and Hiroko-senpai

209
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,310
talking the other day.

210
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,910
I asked the bar's regulars.

211
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,324
The 'Ace' they mentioned

212
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,860
was Hiroko-senpai.

213
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:17,120
Huh?

214
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,281
They said she's been going to

215
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:22,015
lesbian bars since she was a teen

216
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,250
and was a notorious playgirl.

217
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,290
But Hiroko-senpai said she wasn't…

218
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,020
That's why I'm saying she's lying!

219
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,400
Why?

220
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,959
Maybe she's embarrassed

221
00:11:36,984 --> 00:11:38,584
to come out at work.

222
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,770
Ashamed?

223
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,126
Even after you came out

224
00:11:45,142 --> 00:11:46,386
about liking girls,

225
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:48,627
she still finds it embarrassing.

226
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,940
I know you like Hiroko-senpai.

227
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,290
But

228
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,195
isn't it her cool image at work

229
00:12:00,211 --> 00:12:01,491
that you're attracted to?

230
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,040
It might not be her true self.

231
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,250
Her true self…

232
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,870
Even if everything is a lie,

233
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,870
do you still like Hiroko-senpai?

234
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,080
Ayaka…

235
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,143
choose me.

236
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,470
Huh?

237
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,160
Before...

238
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,200
When I said I had someone I liked

239
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,760
it was you, Ayaka.

240
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,820
Huh?

241
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,810
I'd never lie to you.

242
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,475
I'm not embarrassed

243
00:12:46,491 --> 00:12:48,865
of liking girls or liking you!

244
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,340
Oh.

245
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,790
It's just Hiroko.

246
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:01,900
I thought it was Risapon.

247
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,560
"Risapon?" Who's that?

248
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,330
The young girl who came the other day.

249
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,990
She visited again.

250
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,110
Huh? Risa?

251
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,580
Oh, you know her too?

252
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,340
Did you pick her up?

253
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:19,028
I told her all about

254
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:20,920
your old exploits yesterday.

255
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,330
She's a junior at work.

256
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,020
- Huh?
- Huh?

257
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,140
Ayaka, too.

258
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,880
- Huh?
- Huh?

259
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,160
Are you serious?

260
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,540
Risa-chan didn't mention that at all!

261
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,100
Then the suggestive junior

262
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,710
you mentioned was…

263
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,720
Ayaka.

264
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,340
Sorry, Hiro-chan…

265
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,270
Are you okay?

266
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,720
Ayaka.

267
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,320
- Even if everything is a lie,
- Do your best.

268
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,370
do you still like Hiroko-senpai?

269
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,900
I'll massage...

270
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,710
So cute.

271
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,870
I...

272
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,710
I'm not a lesbian.

273
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,870
The real Hiroko-senpai,

274
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,820
what's she like?

275
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,670
Fun times.

276
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,190
This...

277
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,490
Right.

278
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,470
That moment.

279
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,850
Yeah.

280
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,880
Okay,

281
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,910
let's go with this!

282
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,850
Yes.

283
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,150
How's it going?

284
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:04,177
Even if this is the first time

285
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:05,746
a newbie leads a project...

286
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,260
Are you getting along with everyone?

287
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,810
I don't know.

288
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,425
Even if we're not close,

289
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:11,761
we can work together.

290
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,030
Ayaka, do you enjoy coming to work?

291
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,740
Work can be tough, and we do it to live,

292
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,840
but since we still come every day,

293
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,710
don't you think it would be more fun

294
00:15:29,735 --> 00:15:31,297
if you had something you wanted to do

295
00:15:31,322 --> 00:15:32,322
or liked?

296
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,800
Something I want to do…

297
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,960
Something I like...

298
00:15:38,277 --> 00:15:41,257
Yes. Anything.

299
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,223
Something you're interested in,

300
00:15:43,232 --> 00:15:44,747
or someone you want to see.

301
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,980
Don't you enjoy anything?

302
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,810
Not at the moment.

303
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,320
Yeah.

304
00:15:56,591 --> 00:15:58,217
Let me know if you find something.

305
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,110
What a strange person.

306
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,540
Interests and fun things,

307
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,760
forget about those things.

308
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,960
But...

309
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,570
Huh? Really?

310
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,280
Yes! Thank you so much.

311
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,570
Goodbye.

312
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,470
They said yes! Yay!

313
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,500
Senpai always looks so happy working.

314
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,540
Alright!

315
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,270
Yeah.

316
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,117
Is there something else we can do

317
00:16:35,142 --> 00:16:37,529
to surprise the guests?

318
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,560
Yeah...

319
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,260
Ah. How about a surprise guest?

320
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,070
Oh! That's a great idea!

321
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,590
If ‘Tadaken' came, it'd be amazing!

322
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,530
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah.

323
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,170
"Tadaken?"

324
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,790
- That would be such a surprise.
- Exactly.

325
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,070
Amazing.

326
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,000
- Good, right? He's handsome, too.
- Right.

327
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,860
I'll invite Tadaken.

328
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:01,220
- Huh?
- Huh?

329
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,350
Seriously, Ayaka?

330
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:06,402
Yeah. I can contact him.

331
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,890
We're from the same hometown.

332
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,190
- Huh?
- Huh?

333
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,020
- That's amazing!
- That's so cool!

334
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,900
- Is Tadaken coming?
- Yeah.

335
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,220
- Oh my gosh.
- Fantastic!

336
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,250
- If we can...
- Everyone's ready, right?

337
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,190
complete here...

338
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,060
Leave it to me.

339
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:26,491
Here's our surprise guest, Tadaken-san.

340
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,378
Ah, nice to meet you all.

341
00:17:28,403 --> 00:17:30,114
Thanks for having me today.

342
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,680
- Huh?
- Umm...

343
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,840
- Well...
- Wait.

344
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,660
Ah, yes, yes.

345
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,180
Ayaka.

346
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:38,977
Wait.

347
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,190
Who is that?

348
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,880
That's Tadaken-san, isn't it?

349
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,977
Wait, Tadaken,

350
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,175
as in the handsome actor,

351
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,335
Tada Kensuke, right?

352
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,420
Huh? No, he's Tadaken, the comedian.

353
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,530
Who's this "Tada Kenji" comedian?

354
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,300
Huh? But...

355
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,927
In my hometown,

356
00:17:58,943 --> 00:18:00,239
when you say "Tadaken",

357
00:18:00,248 --> 00:18:01,567
you mean Tada Kenji-san.

358
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,010
He's really well-known back home.

359
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:04,570
Haa...

360
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,817
What should we do?

361
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:06,911
There's a talk segment

362
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:08,186
with him in the program!

363
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,895
And it's scripted for

364
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,020
discussing his movies!

365
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,671
Should we cancel

366
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:15,155
the surprise guest segment?

367
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,420
We should confirm with Hiroko-senpai.

368
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,190
- I'll go.
- I'll go too.

369
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,530
Sorry! Thank you so much!

370
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:22,520
Hiroko-senpai!

371
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,030
What's going on?

372
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,430
Hiroko-senpai! I'm so sorry!

373
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,780
Because of me...

374
00:18:29,302 --> 00:18:31,542
Because of me, the event is...

375
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,710
Huh?

376
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,320
I thought

377
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,770
if I could do everything by myself

378
00:18:42,603 --> 00:18:44,663
like Hiroko-senpai,

379
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,180
work would be more fun.

380
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,853
This is the result of not communicating

381
00:18:51,877 --> 00:18:52,994
with my colleagues.

382
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:54,890
But...

383
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:58,611
I don't know how to take responsibility…

384
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,260
Senpai?

385
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,320
Oh, Ayaka is too funny.

386
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,120
You really think unlike others.

387
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,300
"Tada Kenji..."

388
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,750
Ummm...

389
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,860
Wow. It's fine.

390
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,530
A local comedian guest

391
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,570
sounds fun.

392
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,770
But, the script for the talk event…

393
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,720
Don't worry.

394
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,840
I'm responsible for this.

395
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:35,880
I'll handle it.

396
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,100
But it's all my fault

397
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,790
- the event…
- Ayaka.

398
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,100
Calm down first.

399
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,220
Hiroko-senpai.

400
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,373
The fact that you're earnest

401
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:47,771
and hardworking,

402
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,450
everyone knows it, including me.

403
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,350
So it's okay.

404
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,360
Leave it to me.

405
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:06,110
Why is she so kind to me?

406
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,160
What kind of person

407
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,010
is Hiroko-senpai?

408
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,863
Wow, this was the liveliest event

409
00:20:14,888 --> 00:20:16,871
I've ever attended.

410
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,074
I couldn't believe

411
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:19,957
I was the surprise guest!

412
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,600
No, the tour talk was fantastic!

413
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,550
Not at all.

414
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,440
- Please, this way!
- Yes.

415
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,100
Senpai!

416
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,650
Thank you so much!

417
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,930
No.

418
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,270
Ayaka,

419
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,633
you thought about what I said about

420
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,531
finding something fun, didn't you?

421
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,830
That makes me happy.

422
00:20:49,017 --> 00:20:50,237
I

423
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,100
found something.

424
00:20:52,595 --> 00:20:53,830
Something I'm interested in.

425
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:54,890
Hmm?

426
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,180
I'm interested in you, Hiroko-senpai!

427
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,700
That's great.

428
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,920
Then...

429
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,310
Come to me then.

430
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,920
Yes. At that moment, I...

431
00:21:23,457 --> 00:21:26,437
I really realized I'm in love.

432
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,650
I must listen properly.

433
00:21:37,794 --> 00:21:39,914
It's too late to say it now.

434
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,191
Because I want to

435
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,888
know more about senpai.

436
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:51,157
All I can do now is...

437
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,890
live at the company

438
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,320
as normally as I can,

439
00:21:58,345 --> 00:22:00,887
and not waste the chance.
Chinatsu-senpai gave me.

440
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,860
(Next episode)

441
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,160
I like Ayaka.

442
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,094
As a woman,

443
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,816
I love Ayaka who is a woman.

444
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,238
The reason why senpai couldn't

445
00:23:36,254 --> 00:23:37,796
accept my feelings was because...

446
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,520
What are you protecting?

447
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,406
That you had to lie
to yourself like this?

448
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,540
Hiroko, let's make it happen.

449
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:46,490
Hiroko really likes Chinatsu, right?

450
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,320
At that time, I didn't know at all.

451
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,450
I have made up my mind.

452
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,230
I must face Ayaka seriously.

453
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,090
But I don't want to lose Risa.
