1
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,131
Are you free this weekend?

2
00:00:20,147 --> 00:00:21,346
Let me buy you a new one!

3
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:23,980
Hiroko-senpai... A new outfit?

4
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,987
It was my fault,

5
00:00:25,003 --> 00:00:26,416
let me buy you a new one.

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,710
Yes, I'll leave it to you.

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,080
Ayaka.

8
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:40,230
Hmm?

9
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,590
Sorry, did I make you wait long?

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,720
Senpai's casual outfit.

11
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,320
Ayaka.

12
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,660
How delightful.

13
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,410
"Ayaka is in Love with Hiroko"

14
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,080
(Episode 4: Can't lose confidence
from dating a straight person)

15
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,915
Meeting Ayaka outside of work

16
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:41,720
feels very refreshing.

17
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,420
Right.

18
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,950
So what kind of clothes do you want?

19
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,663
Umm...

20
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:50,163
I usually wear one type of outfit.

21
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,520
So I want your input, Senpai.

22
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,290
That's fine.

23
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,781
But I don't know much about

24
00:01:57,805 --> 00:01:59,617
what youngsters wear these days.

25
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,270
That's just an excuse.

26
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,156
I'll take this opportunity to have

27
00:02:03,172 --> 00:02:04,801
Hiroko-senpai help me choose clothes

28
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,715
and find out what she likes.

29
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,080
Isn't that... "sugar daddy?"

30
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,620
Who's a sugar daddy?

31
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,975
I stained that girl's clothes

32
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:22,092
so I'm buying a new one as an apology.

33
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,811
That's good then,

34
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:25,756
what's there to worry about?

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,930
I didn't think of crossing the line.

36
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,620
But even if I didn't,

37
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,570
I'm afraid of digging my own grave.

38
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,148
Because you're staring at that girl

39
00:02:35,179 --> 00:02:36,554
with an ulterior motive.

40
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,360
No, I 'm not.

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,900
Huh? But you're thinking that she's

42
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,450
"pretty cute" right?

43
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,880
Well, I do think she's cute.

44
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,610
She's cute indeed, but...

45
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,870
Well, well.

46
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,570
There are many types

47
00:02:54,602 --> 00:02:56,149
of cuteness, after all.

48
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,680
- That's what you meant, right?
- Yes, Mama.

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,660
As expected of Mama.

50
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,660
But you're staring at her

51
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:02,488
with an ulterior motive.

52
00:03:02,512 --> 00:03:03,552
No, I'm not.

53
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,890
She's a junior in my eyes.

54
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,010
Geez, you guys keep imagining things.

55
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,020
Senpai, I finished choosing.

56
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,590
Oh.

57
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:23,980
What do you think?

58
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,380
Ah...

59
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,329
It's cute but how about

60
00:03:28,354 --> 00:03:30,154
you try other outfits too?

61
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,310
Yes.

62
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,830
Huh?

63
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,860
- Is this one good?
- Above knee length skirts.

64
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,510
- How about this one?
- See through back.

65
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,210
- Or this...
- A bunny?

66
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,530
Why are there only sexy outfits?

67
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,056
At this rate, I'll look at her

68
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:52,338
with an ulterior motive.

69
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,080
How is it? Do you like it?

70
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,150
I really like it.

71
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,177
It's cute but you should choose

72
00:04:00,193 --> 00:04:02,138
something more natural looking.

73
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,560
Is that so?

74
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,272
Keep them as options,

75
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:06,788
and let's go see other stores?

76
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,560
- Right, then I'll go get changed.
- Sure.

77
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,540
So it's not this type?

78
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,431
It's super cute but I don't want

79
00:04:22,456 --> 00:04:24,737
other men to see her at all.

80
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,610
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

81
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,260
- It's so delicious.
- Yeah.

82
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,020
Mmm...

83
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,710
What's the matter?

84
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,740
No, it's nothing.

85
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,190
- Ayaka.
- Yes?

86
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,588
Do you go out with friends

87
00:04:57,613 --> 00:04:59,293
on weekends like this?

88
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,670
Umm... Not really.

89
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,710
Although sometimes Risa invites me,

90
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,220
but we've never done anything like this.

91
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,310
Because I never had any friends before.

92
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,500
Ayaka, let's take pictures.

93
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,520
Huh?

94
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,391
Since you said that,

95
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:28,461
let's take pictures.

96
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,760
Wasn't that trending not too long ago?

97
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,960
Yes, let's take pictures.

98
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,300
Alright, cheese.

99
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,020
So cute.

100
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,280
Then, let's have a lot of fun today.

101
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,180
Yes.

102
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,680
Let's take some pictures.

103
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,050
Ah, wait, this is...

104
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,981
I've never seen it before.

105
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,540
This is a video.

106
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,920
(Ayaka sent a picture)

107
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,350
(Shopping with Hiroko-senpai)

108
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,420
Ayaka has changed.

109
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,500
May I sit next to you?

110
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,790
Ah, sure.

111
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,740
It's like I've never talked to Ayaka

112
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,634
because she doesn't smile,

113
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:58,962
so she's a bit scary.

114
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,260
Umm...

115
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,410
Ayaka-chan is a serious person, right?

116
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,090
Is that so?

117
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,275
Yes. I see you collect information

118
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,971
by yourself all the time.

119
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,798
When I'm very focused,

120
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:19,353
I can't see what's around me.

121
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,090
So, before I knew it, I was all alone.

122
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,310
Ah, is that so?

123
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,378
Actually, I don't really dare

124
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:31,073
talk to other people myself.

125
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,700
Yeah, I thought so.

126
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,580
Huh?

127
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,180
That's why I thought

128
00:07:41,204 --> 00:07:42,993
I would get along well

129
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,770
with you, Risa.

130
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,010
Ayaka, you're so cute when you smile.

131
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,870
The first one who saw your smile...

132
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,420
was me.

133
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,220
Is that so...

134
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:18,690
I...

135
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,250
Haa...

136
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,890
Umm...

137
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,760
It's really cute.

138
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,700
It's good for going dancing.

139
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,070
What?

140
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,650
Oh.

141
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,000
I've never seen a t-shirt

142
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:37,056
like this before.

143
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,050
You're right.

144
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,410
Oh!

145
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,420
What about this one?

146
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,060
It's really cute.

147
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,340
- I'll try it on.
- Yeah.

148
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:46,840
Alright.

149
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,420
Senpai!

150
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,100
What do you think?

151
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,450
Oh, it's pretty. It really suits you.

152
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,870
Completely different from before,

153
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,880
it's cute, like a niece

154
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:05,622
you'd see over New Year's.

155
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,260
It's my first time wearing this style.

156
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,310
Huh?

157
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,780
But you always wear a cute style.

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,620
Yes.

159
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,240
Because I want you to see, after all.

160
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,800
Then I'll buy this outfit.

161
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,590
No, no, let me buy it.

162
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,380
- Is that alright?
- Of course.

163
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,160
- I'll have this one.
- Thank you very much.

164
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,630
But I'm glad

165
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,350
that we find an outfit that suits you.

166
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,880
- It's a good store.
- Thank you very much.

167
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,700
- I'll come again.
- We'll be waiting.

168
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:38,810
This one is good too.

169
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,890
Do you have it in other colors?

170
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,059
Thank you very much,

171
00:09:43,075 --> 00:09:44,196
I'll keep it as an inheritance.

172
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,310
No, you have to wear it.

173
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,890
- Then I'll wear it over and over again.
- Yeah, that's how it should be.

174
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,500
Yes.

175
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,280
Meeting on a weekend like this,

176
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,960
eating a cake together,

177
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,594
and choosing an outfit for me,

178
00:09:55,602 --> 00:09:56,602
this is...

179
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,900
What's wrong?

180
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,980
Well, today...

181
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:04,680
Da...

182
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,260
- Da... Date.
- Ah.

183
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,730
- What do you think about this?
- A scrunchie?

184
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,230
- Yeah.
- Ah, I've never used it before.

185
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,660
If you use this, you'll look so cute.

186
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,830
I'll use it next time.

187
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,070
- Shall we go look inside?
- Yes.

188
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,450
Wow...

189
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,130
Oh!

190
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,680
Huh?

191
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,950
I think flowers suit you.

192
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,480
This...

193
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,770
In sickness and in health,

194
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,690
I swear to love senpai forever.

195
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,980
Ayaka, let's live together.

196
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,530
Yes.

197
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,250
Kiss...

198
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:09,930
What?

199
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,360
What's wrong? Feeling dizzy?

200
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,060
Are you okay? Feeling unwell?

201
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,030
I'm alright.

202
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,520
No, I just thought

203
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,940
"today is absolutely fun."

204
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,020
So cute.

205
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,090
Huh?

206
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,330
Ah, sorry.

207
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,900
No, well...

208
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,200
A niece.

209
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,114
I think you're just like a niece.

210
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,250
A niece?

211
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,630
Umm... I think you're cute.

212
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,926
Like my niece who dresses up

213
00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:42,817
beautifully for a relative's wedding.

214
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,132
Could it be that she thinks this is

215
00:11:48,157 --> 00:11:49,866
like hanging out with her niece?

216
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,310
(SAL Creative)

217
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,841
Well... then let's celebrate

218
00:11:54,857 --> 00:11:57,390
the successful opening of Mellow Hall.

219
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,320
Cheers!

220
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,790
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

221
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,410
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you for your hard work.

222
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:08,680
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you for your hard work.

223
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,623
Ayaka, you're dressing in

224
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,555
a different style again.

225
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,869
This is an important dress,

226
00:12:13,877 --> 00:12:15,246
don't touch and dirty it.

227
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,530
So cold.

228
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,630
Hey, Ayaka, aren't you too cold to me?

229
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,780
Ayaka is like this with everyone.

230
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,450
- Right?
- I didn't intend to do that at all.

231
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:26,980
Everyone,

232
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,520
good job.

233
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,680
Yuya-senpai, Hiroko-senpai, good job.

234
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,271
We're successful like this

235
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:34,116
because everyone cooperates.

236
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:34,940
Thank you.

237
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,983
Not at all. It's all thanks to

238
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:38,772
Hiroko-senpai and Yuya-senpai.

239
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,570
Geez, that's not it.

240
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,090
Senpai is really awesome.

241
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,710
But you did your best too.

242
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,819
Isn't the way she acts

243
00:12:45,827 --> 00:12:46,876
completely different?

244
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,220
- I thought so too.
- I'll do my best.

245
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,760
- I knew it...
- Senpai, let's drink to the success.

246
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,460
- Ayaka.
- Yes.

247
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,090
Oh.

248
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,430
You like Yuya-senpai, right?

249
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,110
Huh?

250
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,730
No need to be shy.

251
00:12:58,065 --> 00:12:59,293
You're completely different

252
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:00,456
in front of Yuya-senpai.

253
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,270
Can you not assume weird things?

254
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,270
I understand,

255
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:04,816
I'll keep it a secret for you.

256
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,510
It's not like that.

257
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,920
The one I like...

258
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,270
is capable, cool, and mature.

259
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,873
A kind person who doesn't

260
00:13:13,898 --> 00:13:15,490
discriminate against anyone.

261
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,180
Even so...

262
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,010
they're absolutely dense.

263
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,480
Wait, that...

264
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,960
What's everyone talking about?

265
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,710
- Oh!
- Sorry!

266
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,630
It's fine, it's just water.

267
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,070
- It's not a problem at all.
- No, please come with me.

268
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,590
- Senpai, this way...
- Wait...

269
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,650
- Huh?
- Huh?

270
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:39,412
Someone capable, cool, and mature.

271
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,723
A kind person who doesn't

272
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:41,696
discriminate against anyone.

273
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,920
Even so, they're absolutely dense.

274
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,090
It's clearly Yuya-senpai.

275
00:13:47,595 --> 00:13:48,820
I knew it, Ayaka...

276
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,260
is in love, huh.

277
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,880
Everyone is speaking nonsense,

278
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,904
it's not fun at all.

279
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,950
You're right.

280
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,040
About the one I like...

281
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,130
I guess nobody actually knows.

282
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,170
It's not like that.

283
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,180
Huh?

284
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,390
I know

285
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,114
that the one you like isn't Yuya-senpai.

286
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,926
The one that you like...

287
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,090
is Hiroko-senpai, right?

288
00:14:46,192 --> 00:14:49,559
How... did you know?

289
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,960
Because I...

290
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,940
have always been watching.

291
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,200
What's with that smile?

292
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,380
Senpai...

293
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,990
I want to make it for someone I like.

294
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,790
Mmm!

295
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:03,800
The karaage is good.

296
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,390
You really like Hiroko-senpai.

297
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,710
Yeah.

298
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,010
A lot.

299
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,320
I also...

300
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,300
have someone I like too.

301
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,440
And that person...

302
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,820
is a woman.

303
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,050
Because you look at Hiroko-senpai

304
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,970
with eyes full of love,

305
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,100
so I knew.

306
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,410
- Senpai, this way...
- Wait...

307
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,410
Haa...

308
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,530
Is that so?

309
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,310
Yeah.

310
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,580
So...

311
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,440
I'll be cheering on

312
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:19,744
your love, Ayaka.

313
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,760
Thank you, Risa.

314
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,650
Let's do our best.

315
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,000
Yeah.

316
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,480
You also like women too?

317
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,010
I wasn't aware at all.

318
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,700
Yeah.

319
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,000
If I didn't know that you are a lesbian,

320
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,834
I don't think I'd have told you.

321
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,865
"Lesbian?"

322
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,170
Huh?

323
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,120
- No way, you didn't know?
- No, I am a bit aware.

324
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,990
Umm... But I'm a lesbian?

325
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,290
No.

326
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,040
I'll let you decide on that.

327
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,369
On the other hand,

328
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:22,074
I don't care about that.

329
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,340
Yeah.

330
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,533
Because I just liked someone

331
00:17:25,565 --> 00:17:26,656
for the first time,

332
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,212
so I didn't know about that.

333
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,170
I see.

334
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,430
I...

335
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,330
When falling in love with

336
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,786
a woman for the first time,

337
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,240
I didn't understand much at all.

338
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:46,780
Ah.

339
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,004
I heard there's a bar

340
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,700
where lesbians hang out.

341
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,300
(Lesbian bar in Tokyo
Bar Kiyoko)

342
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,270
Huh? You've been there before?

343
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,750
No, but...

344
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,610
Actually, I thought I'd give it a try.

345
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,290
Ayaka, if you don't mind,

346
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:14,098
do you want to go together?

347
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,870
Yeah.

348
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,550
I also...

349
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,478
I would also like to consult on

350
00:18:24,494 --> 00:18:26,275
how to communicate my feelings

351
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,360
to Hiroko-senpai.

352
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,370
Oh, welcome.

353
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,610
Hello.

354
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,480
Is this your first time?

355
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,870
Ah, yes!

356
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,350
You don't have to be that tense.

357
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,290
Come in.

358
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:54,900
Yes.

359
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,080
Thank you.

360
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,140
Thank you.

361
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,060
Make yourself comfortable.

362
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,360
Alright?

363
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,050
Make myself comfortable...

364
00:19:13,176 --> 00:19:14,380
can I do that?

365
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,760
It didn't reach her at all.

366
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,880
Is it because I'm a woman?

367
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,630
Because I'm a subordinate?

368
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,590
Is it because of me?

369
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,000
Ugh.

370
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,220
Ayaka, you're making yourself

371
00:19:35,228 --> 00:19:36,316
too comfortable.

372
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,564
Lately, I've often heard stories

373
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:38,656
about love in the company.

374
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,090
Office romance

375
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,720
seems to be tough.

376
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,050
Hmm?

377
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,580
A love that couldn't be conveyed,

378
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:47,846
why not give up?

379
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,950
Huh? When did you reach there?

380
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,776
If you like beautiful big sister type,

381
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,165
there's one here.

382
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,166
Just end your love

383
00:19:55,198 --> 00:19:56,565
for that dense senpai.

384
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,310
- And choose me.
- Hey, hey.

385
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,006
Don't flirt with girls who came

386
00:20:01,015 --> 00:20:02,036
for a love consultation.

387
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,150
If it was me, no matter what you want,

388
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,950
- I'll give you anything.
- Huh?

389
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,220
Then please help me date my superior.

390
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:17,940
Huh?

391
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,750
Besides, I'm not into

392
00:20:19,774 --> 00:20:21,508
beautiful big sister type,

393
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,770
I only like senpai.

394
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,070
You're interesting, Ayaka.

395
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,523
If it's Ayaka, maybe our ace

396
00:20:31,548 --> 00:20:33,304
wouldn't be able to handle you.

397
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,760
"Ace?"

398
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,490
Besides me, there's another person

399
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,270
that don't meet eye to eye,

400
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,020
but she's very popular among girls.

401
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,610
Right?

402
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,178
She's a professional

403
00:20:47,203 --> 00:20:48,883
at flirting with women.

404
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,360
"Ace?"

405
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,109
If you consult that person,

406
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:54,375
maybe your relationship

407
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,953
with your senior will develop.

408
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,500
She should be here soon.

409
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,510
Haa, so tired.

410
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,710
Mama, a strong sake, please.

411
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,260
Hiroko-senpai?

412
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,080
Ayaka.

413
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,070
Oh.

414
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,400
You two are acquaintances?

415
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,910
Hiroko-senpai.

416
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,600
Please wait!

417
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:42,703
Hiroko-senpai!

418
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,410
Why did you run away?

419
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,530
Huh?

420
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,720
No.

421
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,390
What were you doing at that bar?

422
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,850
That is...

423
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,110
Ah, someone invited you there?

424
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,090
Umm, perhaps you don't know,

425
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,170
but that's not an ordinary bar.

426
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:00,820
I know.

427
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,150
That's why I went there.

428
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:04,830
Huh?

429
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,730
I like women.

430
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:11,930
Huh?

431
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:30,770
(Next episode)

432
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:31,973
Why did you go to

433
00:23:31,997 --> 00:23:33,445
that bar, Hiroko-senpai?

434
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,329
Liking women isn't something

435
00:23:35,353 --> 00:23:36,793
to be ashamed of.

436
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,220
You also like women, senpai?

437
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,360
She's okay with anyone with breasts.

438
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,830
She only needs large breasts.

439
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,645
If there's something you want to do

440
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,680
or things that you like,

441
00:23:47,696 --> 00:23:48,916
wouldn't it be more fun?

442
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,580
Hiroko-senpai lied.

443
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,150
About everything.

444
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,420
Even so, you still like Hiroko-senpai?

445
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,600
The real Hiroko-senpai,

446
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,710
what is she truly like?
