00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,650
Not only can you dance,

84
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,760

85
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,890
- That's true.
- Yeah.

00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,200
Bai Luo, you're honestly amazing.

87
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,450

98
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,840

112
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,330

Please, help us.

117
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,240

You've got the wrong person.

129
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,360

132
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,120

133
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,640
Don't you get it?

134
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,730
