This is Qian Bufan's cargo manifest.

Any news about Caishen?

23
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,020
Nothing yet.

24
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,780
But Qian Bufan

25
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,260
places an order every month.

26
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,210
Yet the Merchant Guild

27
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,370
has no record.

28
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,460
(Yufan porcelain, 50 boxes, 500 yuan)

29
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,300
Here's what I think.

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,500
(Cargo Manifest)

31
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,980
This order is actually opium.

32
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,940
If we trace where it came from,

33
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,260
we might find Caishen's warehouse.

34
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,780
What's this?

35
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,060
Take this to Qian Bufan.

36
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,340
(Action Plan)

37
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,420
Are you using yourself as bait?

38
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,170
I can't agree with it.

39
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,290
Why not?

40
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,140
It's too risky.

41
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,380
That's the only way
to get to Qian Muchen.

42
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,620
We don't need to
risk it all for Qian Bufan.

43
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,450
Only if he sends someone after me,

44
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,490
will Qian Muchen act against him.

45
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,890
Your father helped me a lot.

46
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,060
I can't just watch you risk your life.

47
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,850
There's another way.

48
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,100
I'm always here.

49
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,380
There's no turning back.

50
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,940
If you don't agree,

51
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,530
then our partnership ends here.

52
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,910
Young Master,

53
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,620
this is the Vice Chairman of QMG.

54
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,730
He's waiting for you.

55
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,370
You can go now.

56
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,370
Yes.

57
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:55,730
Have a seat.

58
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,900
Mr. Qian,

59
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,010
I need your help.

60
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,730
Just tell me about it.

61
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,090
Qian Bufan.

62
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,450
That wretched guy!

63
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,570
He...

64
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,370
I told you to push down supplier prices.

65
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,290
Can we even make money out of it?

66
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,890
Sorry...

67
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,210
Dad!

68
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,810
Why won't you listen?

69
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,420
I told you not to do these things.

70
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,420
Well,

71
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,450
young people have their own ideas.

72
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,810
Grab some water.

73
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:43,810
Go on.

74
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,290
Hey, little one,

75
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,420
you must be tired.

76
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,450
Come take a break.

77
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,650
Have a seat, come on.

78
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,170
Just relax a bit.

79
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,530
You've worked hard all day.

80
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,090
Look at you, sweating so much.

81
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,860
Let me mop you up.

82
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,060
So, how do you want my help?

83
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,370
Bring down Qian Bufan.

84
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,700
Here's proof
of his embezzlement for years.

85
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,980
But this alone isn't enough.

86
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,620
Qian Bufan

87
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,890
has gotten close with foreigners lately.

88
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,370
He's holding some goods for them.

89
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,450
If we move that shipment,

90
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,260
the foreigners will hold him responsible.

91
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,770
Sir, he's here.

92
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,140
Mr. Luo.

93
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,210
Long time no see.

94
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,580
What brings you here?

95
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,650
I'm here to talk business.

96
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,460
Consider this a gift.

97
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,900
(Action Plan)

98
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,420
My guy stole this from Paramount.

99
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,260
A plan to sideline
the Qian Merchant Guild.

100
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,490
So how do you want to work together?

101
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,370
I'm all ears.

102
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,140
You and I team up.

103
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,050
Let's take over his business.

104
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,020
But first,

105
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:58,980
help me get rid of someone.

106
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,050
Bai Luo.

107
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,810
Why this place?

108
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,860
It's pretty quiet here.

109
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:26,890
Do you remember?

110
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,330
We used to come here for our dates.

111
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,860
Sorry, Luo.

112
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,100
I'm late.

113
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,180
What happened to your face?

114
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,610
I ran into the guy who picked on you.

115
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,090
I taught him a lesson.

116
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,860
Does it hurt?

117
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,770
Can you stop doing things

118
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,930
so impulsively?

119
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,260
I hate seeing you get hurt.

120
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,860
Did you get hit again?

121
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,090
But I won the fight.

122
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,700
I brought you this.

123
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:14,770
Or, maybe,

124
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,650
I can go buy you another bag.

125
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,210
I thought I'd never see you again.

126
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,450
Luckily,

127
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,140
you're back.

128
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,650
But I'm not the same anymore.

129
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,580
Nothing could really change you.

130
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,900
You're still the Bai Luo I know.

131
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,740
This time,

132
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,050
I'll make sure you're safe.

133
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,210
Are you hurt at all?

134
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,050
You should go back.

135
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,450
Young Master,

136
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,300
the assassin was

137
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,370
Qian Bufan's man.

138
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,330

I didn't expect this.

140

Qian Bufan really wants us gone.

141
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,730
I caused all this.

142
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,250
It's not your fault.

143
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,140
Why did you step in front of me?

144
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,170
Because I'm your fiancée.

145
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,140
Don't ever do that again.

146
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,540
I couldn't protect you before.

147
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,220
