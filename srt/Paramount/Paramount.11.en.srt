Qian Muchen.

21
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,740
Tang Zhong.

22
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:35,690
Inspector Tang.

23
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,820
What do you mean?

24
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,970
Heard your warehouse had an incident.

25
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,620
Is a warehouse fire a crime?

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,460
You're overreaching here.

27
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,780
Drop the act.

28
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,100
You have foreign goods, don't you?

29
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,820
And they were taken from the QMG.

30
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,050
Stolen, to be exact.

31
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,530
Did I just spill your secret?

32
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,620
You're an inspector.

33
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,780
Think before you speak.

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,820
Got any proof?

35
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,210
Knew you'd ask me that.

36
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,980
Without proof,

37
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,050
am I allowed to come see you?

38
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,450
This guy works for you, right?

39
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,380
Guess you can't deny it now.

40
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:01,970
Fine.

41
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,450
Even if I stole it,

42
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,840
it's just a few boxes of silk.

43
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,220
Name your price.

44
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:09,980
I can pay for it.

45
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,370
Smart move.

46
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,580
Not much.

47
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,330
Five million.

48
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,460
US dollars.

49
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,570
Even boxes of gold

50
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,090
wouldn't be worth that much.

51
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,460
Does that matter?

52
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,450
As long as you can pay up,

53
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,340
I'll let you go right now.

54
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,250
- Take him!
- Inspector Tang.

55
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,090
I honestly don't have that much.

56
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:53,930
But

57
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,010
I can return the goods untouched.

58
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,620
Trying to stall, huh?

59
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,810
Inspector Tang, you can wait half a day.

60
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,780
And you can't actually prove

61
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,100
this batch of goods

62
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,810
has already been burned.

63
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,540
Alright.

64
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,140
Let's see what tricks you have left.

65
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,090
But first,

66
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,370
you can't move an inch from here.

67
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,460
- Cuff him!
- What are you doing?

68
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,810
This must be Miss Bai.

69
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,370
Cherish this moment.

70
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,420
It's your last meeting with your fiancé.

71
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,450
But if you want to leave,

72
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,650
you're free to go.

73
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,700
You mean it?

74
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,540
I keep my word.

75
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,530
A true songstress indeed.

76
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,220
Knows when trouble's coming

77
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,370
and saves herself first.

78
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,700
(Kasili)

79
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,010
The Police Bureau went to Paramount,

80
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,810
trying to charge Qian Muchen.

81
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,140
So what now?

82
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,260
I want to ask you

83
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:44,890
to help him out.

84
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,860
Did you really fall for him?

85
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,330
I'm not sure.

86
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,210
Don't forget our deal.

87
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,650
You help me take over the Qian family.

88
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,820
I know.

89
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,180
Qian Muchen is Dock Gang's top rival.

90
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,490
Do you think I'd help him?

91
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,860
I'm heading out.

92
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,140
But I'll help you.

93
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,580
Got this just this morning.

94
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,050
It's about Qian Bufan.

95
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,810
He bribed Tang Zhong.

96
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,900
I was worried you'd get involved,

97
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:53,810
so I got it for you.

98
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,490
Why?

99
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,770
I kept hiding my feelings before.

100
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,260
Now I've changed my mind.

101
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,020
I really like you.

102
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,210
Even if you have no one to rely on,

103
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,280
I'll still be here for you.

104
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,300
No need to reply,

105
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:26,890
just take note.

106
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,770
Thank you.

107
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:42,930
You should head back.

108
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,220
(Paramount)

109
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,050
You can't leave.

110
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:09,930
What do you want?

111
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,980
Police Bureau business.

112
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:13,770
Step aside.

113
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,770
Didn't you hear me? Move!

114
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,860
Inspector Tang.

115
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,770
Stay calm.

116
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,460
Got the goods back?

117
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,540
They're outside.

118
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:37,650
Keep an eye on him.

119
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,380
(Paramount)

120
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,650
Sir,

121
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,040
I've checked it.

122
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,580
It really is the missing batch.

123
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,480
Are you messing with me?

124
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,530
Listen, I have a hundred ways

125
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,810
to make your life a living hell.

126
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:22,980
Explain yourself.

127
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,420
I knew all along Qian Bufan set me up.

128
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,800
So those boxes sent to the warehouse

129
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,420
were the fake ones.

130
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,140
Open it for me.

131
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,050
Let him open it.

132
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:29,890
Inspector Tang.

133
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,370
Sorry you came here for nothing.

134
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:42,850
This isn't over yet.

135
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,810
Qian Muchen.

136
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,410
Even if you return the goods,

137
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,140
your theft from QMG

138
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,260
is still a fact.

139
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,260
I can still take you to court.

140
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,060
Qian Bufan.

141
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,780
You're not the only one with proof.

142
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,250
This shows

143
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,810
(Transaction History)

144
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,460
transfers between Qian Bufan
and Tang Zhong.

145
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,170
Recently, a lot of cash

146
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,410
moved from your account

147
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,170
straight to Tang Zhong's account.

148
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,580
That's enough to prove

149
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,540
you paid off Tang Zhong

150
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,050
and set us up.

151
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,540
You...

152
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,100
You're making this up.

153
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,490
How can you prove it's real?

154
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,660
I can prove it.

155
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,620
Dad.

156
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,970
Unbelievable!

and set fire to Muchen's warehouse.
