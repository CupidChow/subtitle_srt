20
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,410
What about my father?

21
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,810
Just because he refused to join you all,

22
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,890
you hired Caishen to wipe out my family.

23
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,620
What did they ever do wrong?

24
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,130
I had given your dad

25
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,810
a chance.

26
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,210
It was him.

27
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,210
He brought this

28
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,050
on himself.

29
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,050
Don't blame me.

30
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,890
It's not my fault.

31
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,530
Only your death can settle
my family's score.

32
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,300
Next up is Caishen.

33
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,890
Who really is Caishen?

34
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,050
Answer me.

35
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,300
Qian Zhongli won't recover.

36
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,370
Soon,

37
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,440
you'll take over your family's business.

38
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,780
So, what's your plan?

39
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,090
First, I'll hand some assets

40
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,820
to the Organization

41
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,220
as the funds.

42
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,870
Then give the workers a bonus.

43
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,620
So they can live better.

44
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,610
After all,

45
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,220
they are innocent.

46
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,620
Next, we just need to find Caishen.

47
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,850
Then the opium business here

48
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,660
will be wiped out for good.

49
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,180
By the way,

50
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,530
the Yunnan branch

51
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:20,980
has already started moving.

52
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,620
How did you know

53
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,330
that the Lin family

54
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,580
is in Yun County?

55
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,820
Is it tasty?

56
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,820
Yeah, not bad.

57
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,010
We don't have this kind

58
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,550
in my hometown Yun County.

59
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,290
Stop asking.

60
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,340
I heard Qian Zhongli had a stroke.

61
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,700
No one can stop you now.

62
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,730
Lin Na.

63
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,320
You really helped me out.

64
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,650
Then do me a favor in return.

65
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,260
I really trust you.

66
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,420
From the moment we met,

67
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,420
I knew you had what it takes.

68
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,420
You helped me beat the old buyer.

69
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,200
This might affect you.

70
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,220
I chose all this on my own.

71
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,140
It's beautiful out here.

72
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,130
Come here with me

73
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,060
more often.

74
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,130
My Lady,

75
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,140
something happened.

76
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,010
Our factory in Yunnan got raided.

77
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,540
Muchen,

78
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,230
I have something to handle.

79
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:55,770
Excuse me.

80
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,260
Lin Na,

81
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,890
Lin City's situation is a mess now.

82
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,530
Maybe lay low out of town?

83
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,450
Don't worry.

84
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,950
Let's wait out this rough patch,

85
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,450
then we'll head back together.

86
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,930
I'm here to say goodbye.

87
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,330
Is it because of him?

88
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,930
No.

89
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,650
Then why leave?

90
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,490
You've already helped me so much.

91
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,770
Qian Zhongli is finished now.

92
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,050
Everything needs to
go back to the start.

93
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,180
I'll look into Caishen myself.

94
00:05:59,090 --> 00:05:59,980
Everything I did

95
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,140
was never for any reward.

96
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:07,980
Luo Shi,

97
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,770
I don't have room for new feelings.

98
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,440
I don't want to let you down.

99
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,420
Luo,

100
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,380
I'll keep waiting for you.

101
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,860
Take care.

102
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,100
(Sinsin Department Store)

103
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,450
My Lady, you have a guest.

104
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,860
He says it's about Qian Muchen.

105
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,740
Let him in.

106
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,940
We're all busy here.

107
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,580
So I'll be blunt.

108
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,260
Qian Muchen tricked you.

109
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,780
(Top Secret: Qian Muchen)

110
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,740
(Top Secret: Qian Muchen)

111
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,860
Since you don't trust Grandpa,

112
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,170
then trust me.

113
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,260
I'll represent Grandpa

114
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,090
to make this deal.

115
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,170
Lin Na.

116
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,810
Lin City's situation is a mess now.

117
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,460
Maybe lay low out of town?

118
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,180
Qian Muchen works for the Organization.

119
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,330
Who are you?

120
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,460
Miss Lin, your memory is really bad.

121
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,260
I helped you dodge the Dock Gang's hit.

122
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,530
You're Caishen.

123
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,930
Why should I trust you?

124
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,260
You have no other choices.

125
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,490
The Lin Factory being raided

126
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,860
was all because of Qian Muchen.

127
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,770
And there's something even bigger.

128
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,300
Qian Muchen's partner is Bai Luo.

129
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,740
They were once engaged.

130
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,490
Do you know Miss Bai?

131
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,860
No, I don't.

132
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,300
Miss Bai, please.

133
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,930
Why are you always distracted

134
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,140
when you're with me?

135
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,260
Got someone else in your mind?

136
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,090
Give me a second.

137
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,860
It's me.

138
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,450
Lin Na?

139
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:37,770
What's up?

140
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,260
Are you

141
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,900
really being honest with me?

142
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,650
Just answer me.

143
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,180
Why ask me that?

144
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,330
My dad just asked me

145
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,100
to go back to Yunnan soon.

146
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,140
Do you think I should go back?

147
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,250
Don't go back.

148
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,490
Stay overseas for a while first.

149
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,180
Alright.

150
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,260
Why are you telling me all this?

151
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,260
Let's work together

152
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,780
