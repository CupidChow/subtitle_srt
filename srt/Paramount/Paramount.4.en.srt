Young Master,

22
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,820
are we still working with Master Rong?

23
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,180
No rush.

24
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,590
Let it sit for a while.

25
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,580
Understood.

26
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,460
Oh, right.

27
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,580
Here's the info you wanted on Miss Bai.

28
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,820
I heard she knew Luo Shi years ago.

29
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,460
Could she be with the Dock Gang?

30
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,660
(Bai Luo, female, 24, Lin City)

31
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,030
Kid, selling cigarettes here?

32
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,180
Did you pay your fee?

33
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,470
Or just hand over that box.

34
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,980
(Qing'an, cigarette seller)
as a gift for me.

35
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,830
Come back here.

36
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,110
Trying to run, huh?

37
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,060
Teach him a lesson.

38
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,510
Stop right now.

39
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,060
None of your business.

40
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,350
Hey, you're pretty cute.

41
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,700
Hey, are you okay?

42
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,140
Get up.

43
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,420
You troublemaker.

44
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,430
How dare you hit me?

45
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,270
Watch out!

46
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,060
- Run!
- Go!

47
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,420
Are you alright?

48
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,590
Where's your home?

49
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,270
I don't have one.

50
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:48,800
Come on.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,930
Come with me.

52
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,110
What's your name?

53
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,630
Qing'an.

54
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,250
What about your family?

55
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,470
They're all gone.

56
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,390
Let me be your sister then.

57
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,510
Sis.

58
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,900
There's powder on your sleeve.

59
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,270
I want to stay with you.

60
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,740
Is that okay?

61
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,490
Then come to work with me.

62
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,670
- Aunt Mei.
- You're here.

63
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,660
How was the banquet last night?

64
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,820
And this is?

65
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,070
My little brother.

66
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,510
He's here to help me today.

67
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,740
Where's Mr. Qian?

68
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,860
He's not here.

69
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,520
(This is an opportunity.)

70
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,540
Sis, are you alright?

71
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,500
I'm fine.

72
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,590
Just a little prick.

73
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,100
How did you get so careless?

74
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,510
I'll get you some alcohol.

75
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,540
Qing'an, I'm changing clothes.

76
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,510
Wait outside for me.

77
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,790
Don't let anyone come in.

78
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,050
Who are you?

79
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,430
Bai Luo brought me here.

80
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,020
She's changing now.

81
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,940
(Qian Muchen, Luo Shi)

82
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,580
Bai Luo.

83
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,540
You can't go in.

84
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,850
This is the Paramount.

85
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,780
There's nowhere I can't enter.

86
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,420
Step aside.

87
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,700
Mr. Qian, you're here.

88
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,220
What's going on here?

89
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,630
Why didn't you answer just now?

90
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,440
My hand's hurt.

91
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,640
It's hard to change clothes.

92
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,800
How's your hand now?

93
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,980
Let me clean it for you.

94
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,860
Any moves from Luo Shi?

95
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,860
Young Master.

96
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,300
The Dock Gang's goal

97
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,740
is to take over the Qian family.

98
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,180
And...

99
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,140
they've planted spies in the Paramount.

100
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,820
What did you say?

101
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,500
They've already made a move.

102
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,820
Use whatever means necessary.

103
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,380
Find the informant right away.

104
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,980
Understood.

105
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,980
Today, I want to thank someone important.

106
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,940
I heard she's known Luo Shi for years.

107
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,340
I'm just a struggling songstress.

108
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,940
Whoever's got power and money,

109
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,980
that's who I stick with.

110
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,100
(Bai Luo.)

111
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,580
(Kasili)

112
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,600
I've got a new plan.

113
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,620
Let's hear it.

114
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,100
I forged an agreement.

115
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,180
(Three copies.)
It could turn Mr. Rong against Mr. Qian.

116
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,700
Mr. Rong is cautious and clever.

117
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,020
He won't trust you easily.

118
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,900
I've got my own way.

119
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
What do you need from me?

120
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,820
Stir up a fight between the two sides.

121
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,180
Why did you decide to work with me?

122
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,980
I owed your father

123
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,580
a big favor.

124
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,600
Think of this as me repaying him.

125
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,740
(Paramount)

126
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,100
How did your foot get like this?

127
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,500
New shoes.

128
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,680
I couldn't bring myself to wear them,

129
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,860
so I gave them to her.

130
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,780
Let me get you another pair.

131
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,780
It'll be fine with time.

132
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,580
Don't be so delicate.

133
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,180
Shasha's right.

134
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,780
At Paramount,

135
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,580
we all follow the rules.

136
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,740
Exactly, that's how it is.

137
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,380
Mr. Qian's got a point.

138
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,380
Here at Paramount,
we don't bend the rules.

139
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,680
Understood.

140
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,140
I'll wear them until they fit.

141
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,900
Aunt Mei, it's my turn on stage.

142
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,180
Let's go.

143
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,020
Aunt Mei.

144
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,540
Let Shasha go up first.

145
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,020
Alright.

146
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,420

Mr. Qian, you won't let me perform.

152
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,060
Are you trying to turn me down?

153
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,460
If I accept it,

154
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,340
what'll happen to me?

155
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,620
Maybe I'll end up on the street,

156

lose everything I have.

159

Bai Luo.

160
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,340
Here's a chance.

161
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,140
Tell me who you really are.

162
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,140
I can let you go.

163
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,820
What are you afraid of?

164
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,980
Are you working for Luo Shi?

165
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,620
What did you say?

166
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,540
I don't understand you.

167
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,180
Just be honest with me.

168
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,420
I can still spare you.

He's the Dock Gang's spy.

171
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,860
(Agent Code 7)

172
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,740
What's wrong, Mr. Qian?

173
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,420
Am I really with Luo Shi?

174
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,610
Looks like I was wrong.

175
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,060
Today,

176
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,380
you put on quite a show.

177
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,020
You keep doubting me.

178
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,900
Are you scared I'll get back at you?

179
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,180
You want me,

181
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,860

182
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,340
What did you say?

183
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,980
Bai Luo.

184
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,580
You really think I can't leave you?

185
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,100
I'll come to your villa tomorrow night.

186
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,220
This is your last chance from me.

187
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,220
