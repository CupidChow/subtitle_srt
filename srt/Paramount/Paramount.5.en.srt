I only believe in myself.

28

If that's how you feel,

29

then I guess

Miss Bai,

37
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,510
I've been around in this world for years.

38
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,760
Do you think just a piece of paper

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,150
can prove anything?

40
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,400
I knew you wouldn't trust me easily.

41
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,790
Tonight, you'll sign with Qian Muchen.

42
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,960
He won't show up, trust me.

43
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,510
If he doesn't make it,

44
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,590
you'll work with me instead.

45
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,910
Let's take Qian Muchen out.

46
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,160

Qian Muchen,

51
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,600
you're dead!

(you'll cherish more)

54
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,190
(since you've lost me once.)

55
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,670
(But it'll just fuel my revenge.)

56
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,240
(Losing everything)

57
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,030
(is what you truly deserve.)

58
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,320
You're awake already.

59
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,670
I haven't slept this well in ages.

60
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,760
How about you?

61
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,510
Did you sleep okay?

62
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,000
All these years,

63
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,320
I've had nightmares every night.

64
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,760
Where were you?

65
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,630
I've been searching for you.

66
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,000
Luo,

67
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,110
I'll be by your side.

68
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,040
I have to head back.

69
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,620
(Paramount)

70
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,040
Mr. Qian,

71
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,040
Master Rong sent someone
to give you this.

72
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,720
I'm returning it.

73
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,190
He said,

74
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,280
he'll wait for you tonight
at Linjiang Road Church.

75
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,200
You really dared to show up.

76
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,280
Master Rong, we have no bad blood.

77
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,000
Why did you take her?

78
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,830
Let me ask you something.

79
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,440
Last night,

80
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,550
where did you go?

81
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,630
It has nothing to do with you.

82
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,760
You little brat.

83
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,420
You really think you can play me?

84
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,040
Alright.

85
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,230
Since you're already here,

86
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,350
then no one's leaving.

87
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,920
I call you Master Rong out of respect,

88
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,830
but I suggest you let her go.

89
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,760
That way, you might walk out whole.

90
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,600
Pretty bold of you.

91
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,230
Qian Muchen,

92
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,160
you better figure this out.

93
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,760
You're the one who started this.

94
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,880
I invited you in sincerely,

95
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,470
but you actually

96
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,280
