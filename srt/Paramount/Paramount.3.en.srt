What's your relationship with Luo Shi?

What are you really hiding?

22
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,330
I'm just a down-on-her-luck songstress.

Whoever's got money and power,

24

that's who I stick with.

Just like this.

26
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,850
It's what all songstresses do.

27
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,410
Nothing to be surprised about.

Unless...

29
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,690
Mr. Qian, are you jealous?

30
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,850
If you want me,

31
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,890
you've got to prove it.

32
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,020
If it's money you want,

33
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,890
I can make you the star at Paramount.

34
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,900
Not enough.

35
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,130
I want to be your date

36
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,340
at Master Rong's banquet.

37
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,980
(You've been gone so many years.)

38
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,420
(Now you suddenly appear.)

39
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,850

Mr. Qian, are you waiting for me?

44
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,770
I'm returning this.

45
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,460
Thank you.

46
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:00,770
Let me do it.

47
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,730
I can take you to Master Rong's banquet.

48
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,530
Thanks, Mr. Qian.

00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,210
Take care, Mr. Qian.

(Yongrong Casino)

57
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,260
Mr. Qian is here.

58
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,620
Pleasure to meet you.

59
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,340
My special guest.

60
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,450
Welcome, Mr. Qian.

61
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,730
You really light up the whole casino.

62
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,780
Thanks for the invitation.

63
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,980
Miss Bai is here too.

64
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,650
Master Rong, your luck is amazing.

65
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,260
Master Rong won again.

66
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,120
Congrats, Master Rong.

67
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,740
Seems like when Miss Bai shows up,

68
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,860
my luck just gets better and better.

69
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,180
We'll excuse ourselves for now.

70
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,980
We won't bother you, Mr. Rong.

71
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,260
Go ahead.

72
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:23,980
Mr. Qian.

73
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,530
Aren't you taking me on a tour?

74
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,860
Why did you want to come?

75
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,740
Bai Luo,

76
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,610
you've really changed a lot
over the years.

77
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,980
It's attractive,

78
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,490
but I sense something dangerous
about you.

79
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,420
Honestly, I don't feel a thing for you.

80
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,090
Save your energy.

81
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,460
I'll remember what you said, Mr. Qian.

82
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,420
Since you feel nothing at all,

83
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,260
then no matter what I do,

84
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,260
you won't get upset, right?

85
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,090
Thanks for inviting me.

86
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,980
If you need anything,

87
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,820
just let me know.

88
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,970
Exactly.

89
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,610
Helping you is our duty.

90
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,330
We all look out for each other.

91
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,460
Master Rong's banquet

92
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,740
is really something special.

93
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,780
That's true.

94
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,900
The drinks are top-notch.

95
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,740
Absolutely.

96
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,020
Mr. Qian,

97
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,980
it's been ages.

98
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,140
You're looking well.

99
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,580
Mr. Qian.

100
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,120
Mr. Qian.

101
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,090
Have a drink with me?

102
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:19,930
Together.

103
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,900
A charming woman like Miss Bai

104
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,090
drinking alone?

105
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,210
That feels a bit

106
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,860
lonely, doesn't it?

107
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,420
You're so beautiful.

108
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,140
Have you ever thought about

109
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,460
working at my casino?

110
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,740
Miss Bai, I promise you,

111
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,180
with your looks,

112
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,140
you could win over every man here.

113
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,980
They'd all be captivated by you.

114
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,020
Just say yes to my offer,

115
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,580
and I'll give you anything you want.

116
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,260
You can name your price.

117
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,860
Plus,

118
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,370
if you join me,

119
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,740
I can offer you a package

120
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,180
more competitive than Paramount's.

121
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,050
- Come on.
- You're too kind.

122
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:27,900
Cheers.

123
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,140
Take a look.

124
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,460
Look at Miss Bai.

125
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,330
She is something.

126
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,740
See how happy she makes Master Rong.

127
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,330
He's so delighted.

128
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,860
- He always wants
- I'll need

129
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,610
- company when he drinks.
- your support.

130
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,490
Looks like tonight...

131
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,090
Master Rong, you mean it?

132
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,930
I always keep my word.

133
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:57,980
What do you think?

134
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,060
Give it some thought.

135
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,140
Sure, Master Rong.

136
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,130
Master Rong.

137
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,930
How does this wine

138
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,850
taste tonight?

139
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,340
So, how is this wine, really?

140
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,290
You'll need to try it to know.

141
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:18,780
Is that right?

142
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,290
Did you drink too much?

143
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,130
Miss Bai.

144
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,850
Do you think so too?

145
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,810
Let's talk somewhere else.

146
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,410
She came here with me.

147
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,060
Qian Muchen.

148
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,850
Do you know who you're talking to?

149
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,690
Let's go.

150
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,900
Keep playing, it's fine.

151
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,060
It's all good, keep drinking.

152
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,010
Mr. Qian.

153
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,730
You lost your cool just now.

154
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,540
If you care that much
about others' opinions,

155
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,370
then what was that all about?

156
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,220
Master Rong is not as fake as you.

157
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,780
At least,

158
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,020
I could feel what he wanted.

159
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,460
Were you putting on a show for me?

160
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,260
Don't you think you're overthinking it?

161
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,140
What does this have to do with you?

162
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,410
I told you,

163
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,700
I just want to be with someone rich.

164
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,970
You don't need anyone else.

165
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,140
I can give you everything you want.

166
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,410
You said you felt nothing,

167
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,460
so am I just here on your call,

168
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,410
something you can toss aside?

169
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,260
I won't accept that.

170
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,490
If you want me,

171
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,580
you need to let go of control.

172
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,340
I'm the one in charge here.

173
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,370
I'll wait

174
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,870
