20
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,530
Mr. Qian, your way of welcoming guests

21
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,660
is really unusual.

22
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,450
I came all this way,

23
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,650
and you just sent a nobody
to meet me.

24
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,930
I didn't greet you myself,

25
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,100
so I must apologize.

26
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,210
Please forgive me.

27
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,660
However,

28
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,180
Miss Lin, you misunderstood me.

29
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,780
This is my grandson.

30
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,810
He's also my successor.

31
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,210
From now on, he'll be the one

32
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,410
negotiating with you.

33
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,820
Muchen,

34
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,440
what are you waiting for?

35
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,570
Say hello to Miss Lin.

36
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,530
Shake hands.

37
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,530
Nice to meet you.

38
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:20,890
Mr. Qian,

39
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,620
my goods are always in demand.

40
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,130
There are plenty of people

41
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,020
offering more than you.

42
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,820
So,

43
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,370
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,260
Miss Lin,

45
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,480
if you want to play dirty,

46
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,210
this small team isn't enough.

47
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,650
Don't act rashly.

48
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,610
Muchen.

49
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,180
This is

50
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,700
just a little test from the Lins.

51
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,100
The Lin family

52
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,300
never

53
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,130
deals with timid people.

54
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,050
Miss Lin,

55
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,140
what do you think?

56
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,890
How's my grandson?

57
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,210
Not bad at all.

58
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,370
Alright then,

59
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,500
I'll just be upfront.

60
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,450
I'm planning to

61
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,650
raise the price by twenty percent.

62
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,060
But,

63
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,140
I want double the goods.

64
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,260
You have such a driven successor.

65
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,580
Future deals will go smoothly.

66
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,170
But in business,

67
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,290
comparing offers is just normal.

68
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,970
Of course.

69
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,930
I'll think about it.

70
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,700
Wait for my word.

71
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:21,930
Let's go.

72
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,420
Muchen,

73
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,730
you stay here.

74
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,980
Host Miss Lin for lunch.

75
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,320
Today,

76
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,420
you did well.

77
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,620
I noticed

78
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,140
she really appreciates you.

79
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,010
Lately,

80
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,260
spend more time with her if you can.

81
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,370
Try to settle the price soon.

82
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,180
Luo,

83
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,700
I'll go see

84
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,530
Lin Na first.

85
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,370
I'll come with you.

86
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,650
I want to meet her too.

87
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,420
You can come as my fiancée.

88
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,780
That might lower her guard.

89
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,580
After we get revenge,

90
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:49,930
what will you do next?

91
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,610
What about you?

92
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,460
If I leave Lin City,

93
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,840
would you come with me?

94
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,460
Why are you still here?

95
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,580
Miss Lin,

96
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,420
care to join me for lunch?

97
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,650
Actually, I have a guest to meet.

98
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,330
Let's go together.

99
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,860
Miss Lin,

100
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,610
welcome.

101
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,170
This is...

102
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,860
This is Bai Luo.

103
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,490
She's my

104
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,700
fiancée.

105
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,820
Miss Lin,

106
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,820
please, have a seat.

107
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,860
No need to introduce you two, right?

108
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,930
Qian family and Dock Gang.

109
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,020
I'll only pick one buyer.

110
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,740
So I need you two

111
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,930
to really show your sincerity.

112
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,980
Mr. Luo,

113
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,420
I want to raise the original prices

114
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,090
by thirty percent.

115
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,860
No problem.

116
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,260
Sorry.

117
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,370
I'll go clean this up.

118
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,180
How did you become his fiancée?

119
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,900
Does this have to do with you?

120
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,050
Don't you know Lin Na is dangerous?

121
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,140
Come with me.

122
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,490
Are you crazy?

123
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,980
Do you want to ruin everything?

124
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,140
I think you're the crazy one.

125
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,180
Why drag Luo into this?

126
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,700
She's back.

127
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,020
Take me home.

128
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,300
Miss Lin,

129
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,580
I'm waiting for your answer.

130
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,770
Mr. Luo's offer.

131
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,300
What do you think?

132
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,650
I can offer more than him.

133
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,180
Do you know Miss Bai?

134
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,420
No, I don't.

135
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,610
The way Mr. Luo looks at her

136
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,490
is so tender.

137
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,490
I don't trust men in love.

138
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,490
I made this myself.

139
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,100
Try it.

140
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,850
You know this place well?

141
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,330
Back then,

142
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,540
I escaped to Lin City
with a group of orphans.

143
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,780
Your father who helped us out

144
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,810
and bought this shop for us.

145
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,170
That's how we got to survive.

146
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,500
Don't worry.

147
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,730
I'll avenge your father.

148
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,620
Come on, eat up.

(Laobaidu Wharf)

150
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,290
I know this isn't easy for you.

151
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,020
Miss Bai has joined the Dock Gang.

152
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,810
She's your rival now.

153
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,540
If she gets in your way,

154
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,290
