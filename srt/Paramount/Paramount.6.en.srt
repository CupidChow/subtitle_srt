Young Master, the casino is all set.

21
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,460
(Qian Merchant Guild)

22
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,730
Chairman Qian,

23
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,850
I didn't know
you and Young Master Qian had issues.

24
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,570
That's the truth.

25
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,690
(Qian Bufan, Chairman of QMG)
I'm just a businessman.

26
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,620
Why work with Qian Muchen?

27
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,620
Doing business with the Guild

28
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,050
is your only real option.

29
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,210
But...

30
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,370
Go on.

31
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:23,530
Sir.

32
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,100
Take a look.

33
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,140
(The Qians Take Over)

34
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,320
(Casino)
Master Rong is gone.

35
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,380
His casino was taken over
by Qian Muchen.

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,330
How is that possible?

37
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,450
If you keep ignoring Qian Muchen,

38
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,660
your right to inherit could be at risk.

39
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,380
Hit him hard!

40
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,980
Stop!

41
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,420
Please, let me go.

42
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,980
You acted really fast.

43
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,060
Over just one night,

44
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,990
you took over
all of Master Rong's casinos.

45
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,740
It's been two years since the Organization
tightened its grip

46
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,980
(Sange, liaison)
on Lin City.

47
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,060
Now in Lin City,

48
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,980
only the Dock Gang

49
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,580
and the Qian family remain.

50
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,810
As your liaison,

51
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,420
it's my duty to warn you.

52
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,700
The road ahead will be dangerous.

53
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,050
I know that.

54
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,480
Why did Master Rong
turn on you so suddenly?

55
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,470
I think I know why,

56
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,010
but it doesn't matter.

57
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,010
If he doesn't show up,

58
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,090
you'll work with me

59
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,220
to take out Qian Muchen.

60
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,700
Then,

61
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,530
I'm sure

62
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,450
you've already made up your mind

63
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,580
about the plan.

64
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,060
Kidnap me.

65
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,290
What do you need from me?

66
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,090
Start a fight between them.

67
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,930
(Since Qian Muchen killed
Master Rong for me,)

68
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,780
(I can use him
to bring down his family from inside.)

69
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,730
The conflict I started

70
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,170
actually helped Qian Muchen.

71
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,700
Is this how you work with me?

72
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,700
You don't trust me.

73
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,240
Remember what we agreed on?

74
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,940
Did you forget already?

75
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,700
(A month ago)

76
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,380
Miss Bai,

77
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,060
where are you going?

78
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,300
How much longer do you want me here?

79
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,740
Your skills

80
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,700
still have a long way to go.

81
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,380
I don't want to keep waiting anymore.

82
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,940
Since we're working together,

83
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,220
every decision should be mine.

84
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,420
You won't risk your life for nothing.

85
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,700
So, what's your plan?

86
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,060
Back then, Qian family
sent a hitman Caishen.

87
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,660
He vanished for years.

88
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,780
But now he's shown up again.

89
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,780
He's one of your enemies too, right?

90
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,140
How can you prove it's really him?

91
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,020
Remember this watch?

92
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,260
It belonged to him.

93
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,460
Where did you get it?

94
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,140
Dock Gang has its own sources.

95
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,060
I'll help you with revenge.

96
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,460
But you need to help me
take over Qian family.

97
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,740
What should I do?

98
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,340
Get inside Paramount.

99
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,620
Start with Qian Muchen.

100
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,510
I won't break our deal.

101
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,060
But here's the thing.

102
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,820
There's progress
on the Caishen.

103
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,490
He's doing business with Qian Bufan.

104
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,300
Who's Qian Bufan?

105
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,360
The leader of the Qians.

106
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,780
He's also Qian Muchen's uncle.

107
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,620
He just got back from the US

108
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,020
and took over
the Qian Merchant Guild.

109
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,660
You can get close to him
through Qian Muchen.

110
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,350
- Chairman Qian.
- Move.

111
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,580
Chairman Qian.

112
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,020
My door's expensive.

113
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,020
You killed Master Rong

114
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,300
and took over the casino.

115
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,060
Did you even talk to me?

116
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,700
What's your attitude, kid?

117
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,400
I'm your uncle.

118
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,150
I know that.

119
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,900
Otherwise, you wouldn't even
get to talk to me.

120
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,220
You...

121
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,060
How about this,

122
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,540
let the Guild

123
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,020
take over the casino.

124
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,220
On what grounds?

125
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,940
I earned it fair and square.

126
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,490
What does it have to do with you?

127
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,140
Would you dare tell the president?

128
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,340
I've made money for the Qian family.

129
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,180
Grandpa will definitely back me.

130
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,140
Or are you going to keep it,

131
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,020
and pocket everything yourself?

132
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,580
Let me remind you,

133
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,260
take care of yourself.

134
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,660
What did you say?

135
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,730
Those canaries you're keeping,

136
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,930
their expenses are huge.

137
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,500
I'm worried you can't handle it.

138
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,420
It's not just about the money.

139
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,920
If it's too much,
send them to Paramount.

140
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,460
I'll take care of them.

141
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,860
You little brat.

142
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,420
Don't forget

143
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,460
your dad was born illegitimately.

144
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,580
What makes you think
you can challenge me?

145
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,900
You outsider.

146
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,040
You said your uncle came to see you.

147
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,300
Did he hit you?

148
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,180
He doesn't like you?

149
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,900
You know,

150
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,900
my father was born out of wedlock.

151
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,580
No one in the Qian family respects me.

152
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,780
These years,
I've made them a lot of money.

153
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,490
My uncle thinks I'll fight him
for the inheritance.

154
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,780
He's always seen me as a threat.

155
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,340
How can I help you?

156
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,500
Luo,

157
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,980
I couldn't protect you before,

158
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,940
but it's different now.

159
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,860
Come back to me,

160
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,500
okay?

161
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,540
I don't want to
keep being someone's secret.

162
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,070
I want you to marry me.

163
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,480
Why are you up so early?

164
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,540
I'm heading back now.

165
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,300
Since you don't marry me,

166
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,540
then what am I doing here?

167
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,980
Luo,

168
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,540
you need some rest.

169
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,300
Take a break from Paramount for now.

170
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,780
(Paramount)

171
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,420
Bai,

172
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,820
you're amazing.

173
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,180
Once you get on stage,

174
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,420
so many guys fall for you.

175
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,260
Isn't that right?

176
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,100
Don't say things like that.

177
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,820
If Mr. Qian hears, he'll be upset.

178
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,140
Yeah, let's not talk about it.

179
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,780
Everyone, keep it down.

180
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,290
Aunt Mei, even Mr. Qian has power.

181
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,660
He can't eat people, right?

182
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,620
Yeah.

183
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,300
Aunt Mei.

184
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,300
What's up with these shoes?

185
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,780
What's wrong?

186
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,820
How many times have I said,

187
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,660
I don't like this style at all.

188
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,740
That was my mistake.

189
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,980
I'll change them tomorrow.

190
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,860
Put them on for me.

191
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,580
This is really too much.

192
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,980
I think you've forgotten

193
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,860
who the star at Paramount is.

194
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,380
Alright.

195
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,980
I'll put them on for you.

196
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,500
Aunt Mei.

197
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,240
Let me do it.

198
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,020
Your feet are beautiful.

199
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,460
Right, Aunt Mei?

200
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,620
They are.

201
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,180
You asked to see me.

202
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,660
I told you before,

203
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,140
you don't need to please anyone.

204
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,500
I also said,

205
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,300
I need something official.

206
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,100
Why do you keep giving me mixed signals?

207
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,220
We can pretend
not to know each other.

208
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,740
You saw it yourself.

209
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,340
I'm just a songstress
anyone can push around.

210
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,840
If I want to survive,

211
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,700
I need someone to back me up.

212
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,700
If you can't marry me,

213
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,240
then I can choose anyone I want.
