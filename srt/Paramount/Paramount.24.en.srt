(Lin'an Welfare Home)

21
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,260
Zhang Fu'an once lived here.

22
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,900
But he passed away long ago.

23
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,300
He had a younger brother.

24
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,060
Here's a photo of them.

25
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,930
The one with the birthmark

26
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:44,980
should be Zhang Fu'an.

27
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,010
But the guy next to him

28
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,740
looks so familiar to me.

29
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,380
This one

30
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,620
is Zhang Fu'an's brother,

31
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,100
Zhang Qing'an.

32
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,260
Hurry back to Paramount.

33
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,940
I'll distract Qing'an for now.

34
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,130
You try to catch him.

35
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,460
Got it.

36
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,620
Be careful, okay?

37
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,340

38
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,710

39
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,870
Qing'an.

40
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,410
Luo.

41
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,700
Why are you here?

42
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,770
Leave.

43
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,090
Now!

44
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,130
Long time no see.

45
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,810
Sis.

46
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:07,770
Qing'an,

47
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,820
who really is Caishen?

48
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,820
It's always been me.

49
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,890
Then why does the file say Zhang Fu'an?

50
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,180
You really don't know?

51
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,100
A dead person's ID is the perfect cover.

52
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,740
Otherwise, I wouldn't last this long.

53
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,980
Did you approach me on purpose?

54
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,380
That's right.

55
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,980
All of this

56
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,650
was my plan.

57
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,960
- How dare you!
- Watch out!

58
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:52,850
Hey, sis,

59
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,680
I want to stay with you.

60
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,490
Is that okay?

61
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,840
Then come to work with me.

62
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,380
I didn't mean to overhear you.

63
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,850
I just wanted to see you.

64
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,380
Sorry about that.

65
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,020
Mr. Qian.

66
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,570
I can go instead.

67
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,580
I'm a fresh face.

68
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,260
It'll be easier to move the goods.

69
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,130
Otherwise, how could I

70
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,100
have taken down Qian Zhongli?

71
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,740
So,

72
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,700
you killed my whole family.

73
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,300
(Five years ago, Bai family)

74
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,380
That's right.

75
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,820
They were innocent!

76
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,460
So what?

77
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,570
I just get paid to do my job.

78
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,850
Whether they're innocent or not,

79
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,460
it's none of my business.

80
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,740
So you found me. What now?

81
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,770
All of this, every bit of it,

82
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,110
is because of Qian Zhongli.

83
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,600
If you want to blame someone,

84
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,900
blame the Qian family!

85
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,770
Let me help you.

86
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,290
Stop.

87
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,820
Stop right now!

88
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,210
Qing'an, Qian Zhongli is already gone.

89
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,170
Let him go!

90
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,770
What?

91
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,700
What did you say?

92
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,540
Let him go.

93
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,010
Let him go?

94
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,430
Qian Zhongli hired me
to wipe out the Bai family,

95
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,330
then tried to silence me after.

96
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,870
If I hadn't gone into hiding,

97
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,610
I'd have died.

98
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:16,930

99
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,450

00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,570
Don't trust him.

103
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,570
Leave.
