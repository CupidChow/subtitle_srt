(Paramount Merged
Into Qian Merchant Guild)

21
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,860
Qian Muchen

22
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,940
has brought Paramount into the Guild.

23
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,090
Not only the Paramount,

24
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,830
but also the casino.

25
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,150
The Guild belongs to Qian Zhongli.

26
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,870
Why did Qian Muchen do that?

27
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,830
I'm not really sure,

28
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,510
but he once mentioned

29
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,590
it was all to convince Mr. Qian.

30
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,870
Sort of a compromise.

31
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:48,870
For what?

32
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,620
Seems like

33
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,380
it's for marrying you.

34
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,570
Sis,

35
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:58,590
didn't you know?

36
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,550
Give me a bit more time.

37
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,580
Once I take over the Guild,

38
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,070
I'll marry you.

39
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,420
It wasn't easy to make time

40
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,870
to have dinner with you.

41
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,300
I hid it from you for a reason.

42
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,350
I wanted to be with you.

43
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,620
I've been working so hard for us.

44
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,390
Can't you wait a bit longer?

45
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,780
He gave up everything for you

46
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,140
and handed all the businesses
to Mr. Qian.

47
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,540
Sis.

48
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,110
Sis.

49
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,100
Are you okay?

50
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,540
I'm fine.

51
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,430

Muchen.

53
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,740
I was just seventeen

54
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,140
when I started this path.

55
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,990
Do you know what I went through?

56
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,700
You need guts to survive.

57
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,380
You also need brains.

58
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,430
Listen up,

59
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,020
the real threat isn't the enemy.

60
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,190
It's the people close to you.

61
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,270
In business,

62
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,380
if there's a traitor nearby,

63
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,660
you won't get very far.

64
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,350
What do you think?

65
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,860
Anyway,

66
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,860
I won't allow

67
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,300
something like that to happen.

the Dock Gang's informant.

No way, she'd never...

80
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,070
She's been lying to you all along.

81
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,550
Go.

82
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,740
Take care of her.

83
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,420
If not,

84
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,710
I'll do it myself.

85
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,550
Muchen,

86
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,020
if you want to be my heir,

87
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,910
you can't be too soft.

88
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,470
You get that?

89
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,550
All these years,

90
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,380
do you know why I always

91
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,350
know your whereabouts?

92
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,220
Mr. Qian.

93
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,190
Sasha?

94
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,380
She works for you.

95
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,990
I have people around you,

96
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,860
and your uncle.

97
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,030
But now,

98
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,830
we don't need them anymore.

99
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,660
Muchen.

100
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,730
I know everything you've done

101
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,750
for marrying me.

102
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,940
I was wrong about you.

103
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,060
Luo.

104
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,030
Grandpa agreed to our marriage.

105
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,310
Is that true?

106
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,370
He's handed the family business

107
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,110
all over to me.

108
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,900
Will you help me run it?

109
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,550
Please?

110
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,100
What's your connection to the Dock Gang?

111
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,830
I honestly didn't expect it.

112
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,060
You used to seem so gentle.

113
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,500
Now you're an informant
for the Dock Gang.

114

(Bai Luo)

115
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,180
You tried so hard to get close to me

116
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,780
just for Luo Shi.

117
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,780
Answer me.

118
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,620
What are you really after?

119
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,780
You're right.

120
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,270
I planned all of this.

121
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,380
I'm here to help him
take over the Qian family.

122
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,180
Pull the trigger.

123
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,270
Master Rong's party is in three days.

124
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,660
I can go with you if you want.

Since we're already engaged,

126
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,060
should I visit your family?

127
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,830
How did you get this wound?

128
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,830
It was your uncle.

129
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,750
Was being with me also just a lie?

130
