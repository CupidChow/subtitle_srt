69
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,980
do you know

00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,780

71
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,460
Come here.

72
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,540
These ones

73
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,700
are all opium.

74
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,420
Every shipment

75
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,700
will be sent to Southeast Asia.

76
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,010
This is what the Qian family

77
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,370
is really in business for.

78
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,450
Only this high-profit trade

79
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,700
lets us rule Lin City alone.

80
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,540
Muchen,

81
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,620
take a look.

82
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,900
Kid,

83
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,260
all of this

84
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,930
will be your responsibility.

86
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,500
I need you to

00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,780
welcome an important guest from Yunnan.

88
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,220
This guest matters a lot.

89

Yes.

93
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,080
Help me with the luggage.

94
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,530
Where's Mr. Qian?

95
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,180
Mr. Qian couldn't make it today.

96
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,610
Sorry about that.

97
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,370
I want him to apologize in person.

98
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,700
My father once told me,

99
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,050
we only work with sincere people.

100
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,700
Why did I travel this far?

101
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,370
I think you know why.

102
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,020
You should head back.

103
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,300
What's our next move?

104
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,930
The Qian supplier is Lin Na.

105
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,370
She's already in Lin City.

106
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,540
Take her out.

107
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,900
Qian Zhongli's business will fall.

108
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,490
Qian Zhongli's on high alert now.

109
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,210
Getting rid of her is tough.

110
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:20,890
Leave it to me.

111
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,420
Got a plan?

112
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,140
I'll find a way to reach Lin Na

113
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,580
as a prospective buyer

114
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,820

115
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:41,890
Luo,

116
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:43,890
come back with me.

117
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,170
Why are you here?

118
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,930
I should be asking you.

119
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,020
I need to talk to you.

120
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,490
This isn't the Paramount.

121
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,210
Don't cause trouble.

122
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,140
She's my fiancée.

123
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,420
Not anymore.

124
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,700
Stay away from her.

00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,100
Qian Muchen.

126
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,900
Our engagement is over.

127
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,610
Ever since you pointed a gun at me,

128
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,090
there's nothing left to say.

129
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,980
We can't go back.

130
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,650
Muchen,

131
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,100
when you see Miss Lin,

132
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,930
be careful with your words and actions.

133
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,450
I get it.

134
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:34,700

137

Miss Lin,

138
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,980
this is

139
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,370
a small token from us.

140
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,050
Muchen.

141
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,170
This is the Second Young Lady

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,010
Lin Na.

143
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,130
Oh right,

144
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,700
you met before.

145
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,370
Mr. Qian, your way of hosting

146
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,490
is definitely unique.

147
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,290
I came all this way,

148
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,590
and you just sent a staff member
to meet me.

149
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,540
I didn't greet you myself,

150
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:25,930
so I must apologize.

151
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,050
Please forgive me.

152
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,600
However,

153
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,020
Miss Lin, you misunderstood me.

154
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,610
This is my grandson.

155
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,870
He's also my successor.

156
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,050
