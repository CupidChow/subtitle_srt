(Paramount)

21
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,780
Morning, Mr. Qian.

22
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,370
Mr. Qian.

23
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,620
Hey sis, you're here.

24
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,130
You look sharp today.

25
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,070
Keep up the good work.

26
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,560
Let me know if you need help.

27
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,300
(Paramount)

28
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,180
Mr. Qian.

29
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,010
Here's Qian Bufan's warehouse location.

30
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,660
I've already moved the guards away.

31
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,260
The delivery for foreigners

32
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,340
is set for tomorrow.

33
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,010
If we move this batch tonight,

34
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,180
Qian Bufan is done for.

35
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,830
Alright, I'll head back now.

36
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,950
I'll go there tonight.

37
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,780
I'll go with you.

38
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,290
It's too risky.

39
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,860
Better not go.

40
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,170
I'm worried about you.

41
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:50,860
Sis.

42
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,450
I didn't mean to overhear you two.

43
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,940
I just wanted to check on you.

44
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,610
Sorry about that.

45
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,140
It's fine.

46
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,540
You're my brother.

47
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,490
There's nothing to hide between us.

48
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,010
Mr. Qian,

49
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,630
how about I go instead?

50
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,570
No one knows me there.

51
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,090
I can move the goods easily.

52
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,700
(Qian Muchen's warehouse)

53
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,180
Come over here.

54
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,940
What's in Qian Bufan's shipment?

55
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,010
Why is it so heavy?

56
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,010
No idea.

57
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,860
Our job's just to sneak it out.

58
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:32,850
Hide it right here.

59
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,050
Qing'an,

60
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,140
keep watch here tonight.

61
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,220
There's a fire!

62
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,290
Someone, help!

63
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,630
Put out the fire!

64
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,460
(Paramount)

65
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,650
What happened?

66
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,370
It's burned down.

67
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,060
What?

68
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,170
Take Luo home.

69
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,080
Tell her,

70
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,170
I won't be back tonight.

71
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,540
Yes.

72
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:32,930
It needs attention now.

73
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,580
What happened?

74
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,210
Muchen's warehouse caught fire.

75
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,740
How do you know?

76
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,090
I've been tracking Bufan's moves.

77
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,490
Looking into his deals with Caishen.

78
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,580
And I found out,

79
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,810
Qian Muchen's people

80
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,980
broke into Bufan's warehouse

81
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,560
and stole a batch of goods.

82
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,930
I didn't get to check what it was.

83
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,900
Then I got attacked.

84
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,610
All I saw was

85
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,650
the attacker was wearing

86
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,490
a Police Bureau uniform.

87
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,580
When I woke up,

88
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,980
the warehouse was burned down.

89
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,900
Why did Qian Muchen steal those goods?

90
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,490
Qian Muchen planned

91
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,530
to work with the Vice Chairman of QMG

92
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,810
to move Qian Bufan's goods

93
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,610
for bringing down Qian Bufan.

94
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,170
You all fell for it.

95
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,610
This has to be Qian Bufan's setup.

96
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,300
Setting the fire

97
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,580
was probably Qian Bufan's idea too.

98
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,700
Luckily, it's just a scratch.

99
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,700
I'll be fine after some rest.

100
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,010
Thanks.

101
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,860
No need to thank me.

102
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,030
You have to stay alive.

103
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,700
You mean a lot to me.

104
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,420
Qian Bufan is close
to the Police Bureau.

105
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,580
Qian Muchen may not handle it well.

106
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,820
Bai Luo,

107
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,140
please be careful.

108
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,140
If things get dangerous,

109
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,700
come find me.

110
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,740
I have to go now.

111
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,490

114
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:11,930
I'll take one.

115

I'm fine.

124
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,140
Qian Muchen.

Chief Inspector at the Police Bureau)

What do you mean?

129
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,410
I heard your warehouse had trouble.

130
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,050
Is a warehouse fire a crime?

131
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,610
You're overreaching here.

132
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,100
Drop the act.

133
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,540
You have foreign goods, don't you?

134
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,490
And they were taken from the QMG.

135
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,490
Stolen, to be exact.

136
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,780
Did I just spill your secret?

137
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,130
