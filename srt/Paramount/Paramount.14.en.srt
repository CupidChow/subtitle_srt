Miss Bai.

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,240
Mr. Qian asked me to pick you up.

23
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:29,700
To where?

24
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,260
He's taken over the Guild

25
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,570
and wants to celebrate with you.

26
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,980
I'm not going.

00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,860
By the way,

31
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,300
Miss Bai won't be coming.

32
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,590

Your engagement with Miss Bai

37
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,300
can be put on hold for now.

38
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,660
I don't want to wait anymore.

Congratulations.

00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,890
I thought you wouldn't show up.

Miss Bai,

42
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,090
have something to eat.

Where's Qian Muchen?

44
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,090
He has something important,

45
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:46,930
so he can't join you.

Bai, Didn't you go to

60

the Qian Residence?

61
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,620
Qian Residence?

62
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:04,780
Looks like

63
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,650
some people are still in the dark.

64
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,730
The Qians are having

65
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,220
a family banquet.

66
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,370
Even you know about it.

67
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,180
Yeah.

68
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,340
Even we've heard about it.

69
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,730
But the real fiancée

70
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,220
doesn't know a thing.

71
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,260
Mr. Qian

72
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,090
probably just toying with her.

73
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,810
No way,

74
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,500
they're already engaged.

75
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,980
Engaged?

76
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,740
He still could call it off.

77
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,370
Mr. Qian,

78
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,140
I heard you handed the Guild

79
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,530
over to Mr. Qian.

80
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,370
Yeah.

81
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,610
Muchen

82
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,370
will be my successor.

83
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,180
Your future looks bright.

84
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,370
It's all thanks to my grandpa.

85
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,580
Muchen.

86
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,300
What brings you here?

87
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,050
And who is this?

88
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,980
I'm Muchen's fiancée.

89
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,330
Oh,

90
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,580
I haven't heard of it.

91
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,100
Grandpa,

92
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,370
sorry, I'm late.

93
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,210
Paramount was a bit swamped.

94
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,770
You're not mad at me, are you, Grandpa?

95
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,740
Of course not.

96
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,860
Mr. Qian,

97
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,810
I'll take my leave now.

98
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,580
Goodbye.

99
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,860
Take care.

100
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,140
I'm going to get some rest.

101
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,980
Why did you go there without telling me?

102
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,610
I'm your fiancée.

103
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,300
Don't I have the right to go?

104
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,300
You know I didn't mean that.

105
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,140
Even Aunt Mei and Shasha
knew about the banquet,

106
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,260
but I had no idea.

107
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,260
What do you take me for?

108
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,020
I kept it from you for a reason.

109
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,370
I've been working hard to be with you.

110
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,420
I've never stopped trying.

111
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,210
Can't you wait a bit longer?

112
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,100
Working hard?

113
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,860
It's all about taking over
the family property.

114
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,180
All you care about

115
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,610
is your own interests.

116
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,770
Bai Luo,

117
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,140
watch what you say.

118
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,140
That look is just like five years ago.

119
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,580
You really haven't changed at all.

120
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,490
Fine.

121
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,740
Since we both have our own reasons,

122
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,650
let's stop forcing each other.

123
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,750
We shouldn't meet anymore.

124
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,170
Muchen,

125
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,460
I was being too stubborn.

126
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,300
Qian Muchen,

127
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,140
whether we meet is up to me,

128
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,930
not you.

129
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,610
If I just wave you over,

130
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,140
you'd come running to me.

131
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,700
So, I get to decide.

132
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,780
According to this file,

133
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,930
before she joined Paramount,

134
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,930
she already knew the Dock Gang.

135
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,420
That's right.

136
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,260
Even the financial records

137
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,020
of Bufan and Tang Zhong

138
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,970
were given to her by Luo Shi.

139
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,130
Tomorrow,

140
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,340
have Mu Chen meet me.

141
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,820
(Bai Luo)

142
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,330
Sis.

143
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,370
I bought this for you.

144
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,450
Hurry, try it.

145
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,440
Why did you move out
of Mr. Qian's place?

146
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,220
Here's today's newspaper.

147
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,660
(Paramount Merged
Into Qian Merchant Guild)

148
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,660
Qian Muchen

149
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,730
has brought Paramount into the Guild.

150
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,260
Not only the Paramount,

151
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,780
but also the casino.

152
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,020
The Guild belongs to Qian Zhongli.

153
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,540
Why did Qian Muchen do that?

154
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,050
I'm not really sure,

155
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,290
but he once mentioned

156
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,610
it was all to convince Mr. Qian.

157
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,660
Sort of a compromise.

158
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,580
For what?

159
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,830
