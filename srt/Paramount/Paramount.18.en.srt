This isn't easy for you.

22
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,650
Miss Bai has joined the Dock Gang.

23
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,460
She's your rival now.

24
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,180
If she gets in your way,

25
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,940
you'll have to make a choice.

26
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,780
Understood.

27
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,170
We're so close to the finish line.

28
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,620
We need Lin Na to trust us.

29
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,210
That's the key to taking down

30
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,660
Qian Zhongli.

31
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,940
I'll close the deal with Lin Na soon.

32
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,940
If there's a chance,

33
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,100
find out
where the Lin family's factory is.

34
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,780
The Yunnan branch

35
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,300
will back you up with the cleanup.

36
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,730
Grandpa.

37
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,290
You asked to see me.

38
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,260
Muchen,

39
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,660
Miss Lin wants to

40
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,170
look around Lin City.

41
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,370
Can you

42
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,980
act as her guide?

43
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,690
Muchen,

44
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,890
make sure to keep Miss Lin company.

45
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,740
You're my guide.

46
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,700
Aren't you going to explain a bit?

47
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,220
The buildings here

48
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,450
are over a hundred years old.

49
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,890
What about this grass?

50
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,530
Is it a hundred years old too?

51
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,890
Maybe these trees are.

52
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,580
Have you decided who to trade with?

53
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,090
I want to stay in Lin City

54
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,420
a few more days.

55
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,890
You're just dragging things out

56
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,700
for raising the price.

57
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,170
I thought you were just skilled.

58
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,260
Turns out you're also smart.

59
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,260
I'll add fifty percent to the price.

60
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:23,930
Let's close the deal.

61
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,570
Alright?

62
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,030
I'm hungry.

63
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,290
Let's grab something to eat.

64
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,220
Why are you rushing this deal?

65
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,860
Grandpa picked me as his successor.

66
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,800
I don't want to let him down.

67
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,780
But how are you so sure

68
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,730
Mr. Qian wants you to take over?

69
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,140
He kept my goods in Lin City to sell.

70
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,290
The ones shipped aboard

71
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,570
were lower quality.

72
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:15,860
You didn't know that?

73
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,620
Honestly, I really wasn't aware.

74
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:18,890
But pretty soon...

75
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,450
How can I do business
with someone I can't trust?

76
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,460
Wait a second.

77
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,930
Miss Lin, if you can't trust Grandpa,

78
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,290
then trust me.

79
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,370
I'll represent him

80
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,220
to do the deal with you.

81
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,650
You want to go against him.

82
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,530
The Qian family will be mine.

83
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,260
So if I work with you,

84
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,180
what do I get out of it?

85
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,460
You'll get more benefits.

86
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,050
Lin Na's goods are stashed right here.

87
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,490
We move in tomorrow.

88
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,210
You must secure those goods.

89
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,610
Do you understand?

90
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,460
Got it.

91
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,450
You head out first.

92
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,880
Yes.

93
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:11,930
Tomorrow, we will

94
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,530
raid Lin Na's warehouse.

95
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,930
So you're taking action.

96
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,020
If these goods go public,

97
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,320
Lin Na won't have a place in Lin City.

98
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,650
Qian Zhongli will lose his supplies.

99
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,860
I'll go with you.

100
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,170
No, you stay here.

101
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,490
Wait for my update.

102
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,140
This is my responsibility.

103
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,460
I can't let you take the risk alone.

104
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,450
Miss Lin.

105
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,420
Here's your letter.

106
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:57,930
What's wrong?

107
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,460
People here are really impatient
in business.

108
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,300
Tomorrow.

109
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,580
I'll give you an answer.

110
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,340
(Sincere Company Limited)

111
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,180
You've been quiet

112
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,050
since just now.

113
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,300
Does my outfit look good?

114
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,090
You look great in anything.

115
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,300
What's that?

116
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,820
Red delicious apple.

117
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,210
Foreign fruit.

118
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,860
I've never seen one before.

119
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,680
You can give it a try.

120
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,180
If you like it,

121
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:04,650
tell me your address.

122
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,490
I can deliver it to Yunnan for you.

123
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,740
No need for that.

124
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,700
Where are we going?

125
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:13,770
Let's get going.

126
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,050
This place looks pretty old.

127
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,860
I grew up here as a kid.

128
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,210
Not at the Qian family estate?

129
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,120
My father was born illegitimately.

130
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,190
He wasn't allowed to live there.

131
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,460
We only dropped by sometimes.

132
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,090
So,

133
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,700
that's why you want to be the heir.

134
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,450
Have you decided

135
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,370
to make a deal with me?

136
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,580
My father once said,

137
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,650
you have to truly know your partners.

138
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,810
He'd probably really like you.

139
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,490
Planning to ditch me?

140
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:25,980
Luo.

141
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:27,610
I'll come back.

142
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,330
I have to be part of this.

143
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,700
If anything happens to me,

144
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,370
at least you'll still...

145
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,610
Getting justice for my family
is my goal.

146
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,980
I can't let you carry all this alone.

147
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,610
What's the price for this deal?

148
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,380
Take a guess.

149
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,540
Same as before,

150
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:26,900
but I want double.

151
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,460
I'll check with Grandpa.

152
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,300
No.

153
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,170
I want you to decide.

154
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,850
You said you wanted to handle this alone.

155
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,340
I can help you skip Qian Zhongli.

156
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,050
That's why I want double.

157
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,460
It might break the rules,

158
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,020
but since it's you,

159
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,900
I think it's okay.

160
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,290
You're really brave

161
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:03,970
and also smart.

162
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,580
But most importantly,

163
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,460
I really admire you.
