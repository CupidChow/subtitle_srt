20
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,060
Do you realize
how risky it is to come here?

21
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,730
You're the one in danger.

22
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,060
I heard Qian Bufan losing his job.

23
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,820
You've met Qian Zhongli.

24
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,140
Qian Zhongli

25
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,970
killed Tang Zhong without hesitation.

26
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,410
You can't take him on.

27
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,810
But this is something I have to do.

28
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,540
Besides, Qian Zhongli trusts Mu Chen.

29
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,410
So I won't be in any danger.

30
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,100
You're underestimating him.

31
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,050
Qian Zhongli

32
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,010
has been dealing opium
with gangs in Yunnan.

33
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,010
What?

34
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,690
Qian Bufan teamed up with Caishen,

35
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,590
and that provoked Qian Zhongli.

36
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,050
So he paid the price.

37
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,470
Zhongli doesn't even trust his son.

38
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,400
He won't trust you.

39
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,340
I've never meddled in your plans,

40
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,500
but this time,

41
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,730
I want you to step out of it.

42
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,770
Staying close to Qian Muchen

43
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,940
is really dangerous.

44
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,900
If you need help,

45
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,530
the Dock Gang is here for you.

46
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,860
Luo.

47
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,540
You're back.

48
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,400
Did Grandpa mention the proposal?

49
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,290
He did.

50
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,770
But I need to sort out

51
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,180
the business first.

52
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,460
What's wrong?

53
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,010
I don't want to wait anymore.

54
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,140
Give me a little more time.

55
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,370
Once I take over the Guild,

56
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,650
I'll marry you.

57
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,980
Muchen,

58
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,650
I'll go see Grandpa with you.

59
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,820
Next time, okay?

60
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,740
(Paramount)

61
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,580
Mr. Qian, it's been ages
since you came by.

62
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,290
No wonder the place feels brighter.

63
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,340
Turns out it's because you're here.

64
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,090
Thank you, Aunt Mei.

65
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,260
It's my job, really.

66
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,730
Aunt Mei, bring out a good bottle.

67
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,010
Right away.

68
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,770
Muchen.

69
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,260
You've managed this place really well.

70
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,210
But just a ballroom alone

71
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,810
won't be enough to help the family.

72
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,900
If you want to stand out

73
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,700
in Lin City,

74
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,050
you'll need bigger business ventures.

75
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,490
You're right.

76
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,210
Here's the red wine.

77
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,740
We also have new pastries.

78
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,860
Give them a try.

79
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,100
Not bad at all.

80
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,860
Here you go. Enjoy it.

81
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,400
Mr. Qian.

82
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,260
Go ahead.

83
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,260
Aunt Mei, you missed a glass.

84
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,330
I'll pour it myself.

85
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,170
Don't mind me.

86
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,140
Grandpa.

87
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:39,770
Muchen.

88
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,980
Grandpa, why didn't you tell me

89
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,980
you were coming?

90
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,370
I'm just dropping by with Grandpa.

91
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,610
Grandpa,

92
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,740
let me toast you.

93
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,170
Luo.

94
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,700
What is it?

95
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,860
As your fiancée,

96
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,650
can't I toast Grandpa?

97
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,140
Here you go.

98
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,170
Luo,

99
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,300
Grandpa and I
have a business to discuss.

100
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,260
You should head back.

101
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,140
Grandpa,

102
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,580
Muchen and I
are having our wedding next month.

103
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,700
You have to be there, okay?

104
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,420
I feel a bit tired right now.

105
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,580
I'm heading out.

106
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,650
So, you mean,

107
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,460
she's met Luo Shi before?

108
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,860
Someone, come here.

109
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,140
Go find out

110
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,900
everything for me.

111
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,210
Bai Luo's background.

112
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,930
See what she's been up to
these five years.

113
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,740
Bring me all the details.

114
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,420
Have a seat.

115
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,700
I can't visit as often lately.

116
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,050
Try this.

117
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,460
I bought it for you.

118
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,460
This is a villa in the suburbs,

119
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:03,930
close to Lin City.

120
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,130
What do you mean?

121
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,700
Stay there for a while.

122
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,470
Once I'm done with the Guild,

123
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,720
I'll get you back home.

124
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,330
Where are you going?

125
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,100
To handle things at Paramount.

126
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,410
I need to head over.

127
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,260
You're leaving now?

128
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,200
It took a lot for me to make time

129
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,540
to have a meal with you.

130
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,380
Thanks.

131
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,330
Luo.

132
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,250
I'm really busy too.

133
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,220
Maybe next time.

134
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,690
When that day comes,

135
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,580
