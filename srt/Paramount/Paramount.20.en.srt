=Episode 20=

20
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,590
He actually wants to
replace Qian Zhongli.

21
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:28,970
Might as well use this chance

22
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,490
to take revenge.

23
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,290
What if he's just like Qian Zhongli?

24
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,940
That won't happen.

25
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,260
He'd never touch opium.

26
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,180
Power often

27
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,210
changes people.

28
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,660
Why'd you come to me?

29
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,780
After this plan is done,

30
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,510
I hope you won't take over
the opium business.

31
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:28,890
Bai Luo,

32
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,620
what do you really want?

33
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,130
Justice for my family.

34
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,300
Years ago, my dad looked into
the opium source

35
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,530
and made a lot of enemies because of it.

36
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,300
In the end, Caishen wiped out
my whole family.

37
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,740
Qian Zhongli was the one behind it all.

38
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,340
I'll never let him get away with it.

39
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,340
This all started because of opium.

40
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,380
I don't want you to follow in his path.

41
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,700
I didn't know Grandpa did that.

42
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,900
Please, trust me.

43
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,420
I believe you.

44
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,650
You said you didn't know,

45
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,890
but do you remember what you did then?

46
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,420
You broke off

47
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,810
our engagement and dumped me.

48
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,650
That's not true.

49
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,780
(Five years ago, Qian Residence)

50
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,620
Did the Bai family hand over the ledger?

51
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,560
Not yet.

52
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,220
Looks like that old man

53
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,780
is really determined to take the lead.

54
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,890
If he still won't give us the evidence,

55
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,780
grab his daughter

56
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,530
and send her to those enemies.

57
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,700
I'm sure he cares about her.

58
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,860
I didn't think it through.

59
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,420
Grandpa wanted to hurt you,

60
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,010
so I wanted to keep you safe.

61
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,730
This is the only way I know.

62
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:12,890
Please forgive me.

63
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,620
Forgive?

64
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,780
How can you say that

65
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,290
like it means nothing at all?

66
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,810
I believe everything you said.

67
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,890
But these last five years,

68
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,450
every day was filled with pain.

69
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,290
That pain is carved in my heart.

70
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,490
How could you ever feel that?

71
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,260
I know you wanted to protect me.

72
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,490
But forgiving you isn't so easy.

73
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,610
Besides, there are bigger things to do.

74
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,980
Qian Zhongli will pay for what he did.

75
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,770
So will that hitman Caishen.

76
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,740
What's going on here?

77
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,370
I invited Mr. Luo and Miss Bai

78
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,260
to go on a trip.

79
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,180
Everyone's here now.

80
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,490
Let's get going then.

81
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,330
Miss Bai, please.

82
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,490
Thank you.

83
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,020
Thanks, Mr. Qian.

84
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,330
Luo.

85
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:32,890
Give it a try.

86
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,090
It tastes pretty good.

87
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,650
You really care about Miss Bai.

88
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,740
She deserves it.

89
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,610
What are your plans, Mr. Luo?

90
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,100
I'm planning to

91
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,580
leave Lin City with Luo

92
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,990
and live a simple life.

93
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,170
What about you?

94
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,370
I'll run the business here

95
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,370
with Muchen.

96
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,460
So, Miss Bai, you're leaving.

97
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,090
I'm sure Mr. Qian and Miss Lin

98
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,770
will manage the business well.

99
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,140
When will you close the deal?

100
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,740
Don't rush it.

101
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,490
Lin Na.

102
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,530
We've got plenty of time.

103
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,020
So let's keep some space.

104
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,580
Let's take it slow.

105
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:41,650
Alright?

106
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,490
When you say space,

107
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,420
do you mean this much,

108
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,740
or this much?

109
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,260
But you're right.

110
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,700
We do have a lot of time ahead.

111
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,970
My dad agreed I could stay in Lin City.

112
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,220
Aren't you happy, Muchen?

113
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,410
Why are you always distracted

114
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,610
when you're with me?

115
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,730
Is it due to someone else?

116
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,940
Of course not.

117
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,290
If you choose to be with me,

118
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,220
I need you to be all in with me.

119
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,740
