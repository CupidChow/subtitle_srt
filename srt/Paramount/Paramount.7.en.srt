can you become the sole heir.

Leave alone, or should I walk you out?

62
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,780
I paid for this.

63
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,930

76
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,780
You brought me back.

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,500
Do you want to tell me something?

78
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:47,930
Luo, why don't you

79
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,770
move in with me?

80
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,020
Maybe give it a little time.

81
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,330
I don't want people to look down on me.

82
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,930
Since we're engaged now,

83
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,490
should I visit the Qian family?

84
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,900

85
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,610
you not see them at all.

That's me.

101
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,050
Here's your letter.

102

Isn't that Mrs. Qian?

She always acts so proper.

104
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,900
But secretly, she's flirting everywhere.

I don't get why Mr. Qian

106
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,740
even likes someone like you.

107
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,090
If you don't know why he likes me,

108
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,740
at least you know
why he doesn't like you.

109
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,330
What did you say?

110
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,370
Because as a woman,

111
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,610
you're just not charming at all.

112
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,820

Seeing you now, I get why.

123
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,660
You probably already know,

124
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,610
I'm Qian Muchen's uncle.

125
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,020
That means we're family now.

126
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,930
Uncle, is there something you need?

127
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,340
Miss Bai, you're gorgeous

128
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,780
and so talented too.

129
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,540
But being with Qian Muchen,

130
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,260
what a shame.

131
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,700
Why would you say that, uncle?

132
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,730
As for Qian Muchen,

133
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,050
he looks impressive,

134
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,540
but in reality,

135
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,140
he's an illegitimate child.

136
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,340
So he can't inherit anything from us.

137
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,260
If you stay with him,

138
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,020
life won't be easy for you.

139
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,380

I've met many songstresses.

141

someone with money.

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:03,930
Miss Bai,

144
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,900

Go ahead, uncle.

00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,330
What do you need?

153
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,460
Back then, Qian family
sent a hitman Caishen.

154
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,490
He vanished for years,

155
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,610
and just resurfaced recently.

156
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,260
He's doing business with Qian Bufan.

157

You can approach him
through Qian Muchen.

It's simple.

159
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,410
Just take this,

160
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,290
and put it in Qian Muchen's office.

161
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,020
I'll get the Police Bureau
to search the Paramount.

162
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,140
He's definitely involved somehow.
