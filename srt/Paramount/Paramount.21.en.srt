Aren't you happy, Muchen?

22
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,410
Why are you always distracted

23
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,540
when you're with me?

24
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,700
Got someone else in your mind?

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,060
Of course not.

00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,060
If you choose to be with me,

27
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,290
I need you to be all in with me.

28
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:58,770
Alright?

29
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,860
I'm just worried about our deal.

30
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,770
You don't have to.

31
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:09,930
The deal is scheduled

32
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,970
for the day after tomorrow.

33
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,460
This is Qian Zhongli's warehouse.

34
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,180
Tomorrow, we'll split up.

35
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,040
Lin Na and I will go to

36
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,500
the deal location.

37
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,690
Luo Shi,

38
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:41,980
you and Bai Luo

39
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,540
secure the warehouse.

40
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,340
And after that?

41
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,210
Let's expose

42
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,050
his opium dealings,

43
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,820
so he faces the consequences he deserves.

44
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,850
I'll reach out to reporters

45
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,290
to get it covered.

46
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,260
Once we're done,

47
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,600
let's meet up at the warehouse.

48
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,810
Stay safe out there.

49
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,730
Miss Lin,

50
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,430
I'm curious about something.

51
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,140
How did you find out

52
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,020
that we were targeting you?

53
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,060
(For Lin Na's eyes only)

54
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,180
(For Luo Shi's eyes only)

55
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,620
It's from Caishen.

56
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,100
He told me

57
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,290
where your warehouse was.

58
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,300
(Luo Shi, Lin Na)

59
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,260
The same handwriting.

60
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,460
(Luo Shi, Lin Na)

61
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,410
So, in other words,

62
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,260
Caishen leaked the news

63
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,410
to Miss Lin purposely,

64
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,180
trying to cause infighting.

65
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,780
(Distribution Area)

66
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:41,780
(Linjiang Dockworkers Union)

67
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,340
Young Master,
Mr. Qian sent me for the goods.

68
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,370
What's going on?

69
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,900
Let's head back now.

70
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,250
I have to

71
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,810
clear things up with Qian Zhongli.

72
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,620
I'll go with you.

73
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,900
It's not appropriate.

74
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,300
I'll be back.

75
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,620
Nobody moves.

76
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,970
Sir, all the opium is here.

77
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,970
Luo Shi, the reporters have arrived.

78
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,130
Mr. Luo.

79
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,090
Is Qian Zhongli really selling opium?

80
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,850
Did you find the opium

81
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,780
in his warehouse.

82
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,020
It's all over there.

83
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,900
Let's go. Get photos of everything.

84
00:07:59,130 --> 00:07:59,970
Don't worry.

85
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:01,900
This time, Qian Zhongli

86
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,850
will be convicted.

87
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,460
No idea how Qian Muchen is doing.

88
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:21,930
Luo,

89
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,970
let's go see Qian Zhongli.

90
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,510
You should settle things

91
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,090
face to face.

92
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,740
Let's go.

93
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,020
Did the deal go smoothly?

94
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,370
Say something.

95
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,340
Someone,

96
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,650
get in here.

97
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,690
- Someone.
- Grandpa,

98
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,760
they're all out delivering goods.

99
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,370
Muchen,

100
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,940
what are you planning to do?

101
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,690
Qian Zhongli.

102
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,570
All these years,

103
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,340
you've sold opium
hurting people in Lin City.

104
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:54,690
Today,

105
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,340
it's time you paid the price.

106
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,780
And you think you can do that?

107
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,490
- Speak.
- Mr. Qian,

108
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,780
our warehouse has been raided.

109
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,540
The press exposed the opium trade.

110
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,610
The police are on the way to arrest you.

111
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,130
You need to leave Lin City now.

112
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,570
You did all this, didn't you?

113
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,250
Why would you do this to me?

114
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,050
You destroyed everything I built.

115
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,900
Muchen,

116
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,460
I was going to make you my heir.

117
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,930
How could you treat...

118
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,010
your...

119
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,210
own grandfather?

120
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,210
Grandpa,

121
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,730
I never wanted to be your successor.

122
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,590
Besides, I'm already
with the Organization.

123
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,490
Our goal is clear,

124
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,170
to protect the people
from people like you.

125
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,130
Ever sale

126
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,140
has its buyer.

127
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,780
Did I force them to use opium?

128
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,020
That was their choice.

129
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,780
They brought it on themselves.

130
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,540
None of them are innocent.

131
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,380
They...

132
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:28,780
