It might not follow the rules,

but since it's you,

22
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,980
I'm okay with it.

23
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,220
You're really brave

24
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:38,940
and also very smart.

25
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,570
But most of all,

26
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,380
I really admire you.

27
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:17,980
My Lady,

28
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,050
just as you arranged,

29
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,410
we've got them under control.

30
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,180
Go ahead.

31
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,730
Let's move.

32
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,420
I'll show you something.

33
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,820
Mr. Luo,

34
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,530
I'm honestly here to do business.

35
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,550
But you tried to set me up.

36
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,890
She isn't involved.

37
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,410
Come at me.

38
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,700
Weren't you always after him?

39
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,370
I'll help you.

40
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,460
Take them out.

41
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,460
Qian Muchen.

42
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,290
You owe me an explanation.

43
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,340
Are you alright?

44
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,220
What happened here?

45
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,570
Why are you here?

46
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,420
Not your concern.

47
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,060
You need to figure out

48
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,570
how to face Lin Na

49
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,620
after you've done this.

50
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,260
Don't worry.

51
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,620
Please be careful.

52
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,460
Look after Luo.

53
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,700
Lin Na.

54
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:57,980
Why did you stop me?

55
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,920
We can't take them out.

56
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:01,980
To bring Grandpa down,

57
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,930
I need the Dock Gang.

58
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,620
They were planning to go after me today.

59
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,820
I'll discuss

60
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,900
a deal with them.

61
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,260
On my own,

62
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,170
I can't take on Grandpa.

63
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,580
This is the first time I've shown mercy.

64
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,100
Show me

65
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,460
I made the right call.

66
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:50,930
Who sent you here?

67
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,610
What are you up to?

68
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,670
What do you want?

69
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,900
Come any closer and I'll act.

70
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,410
Do you know where you are?

71
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,410
This is our turf.

72
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,860
Let him through.

73
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,940
Something's up?

74
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,010
Mr. Luo.

75
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:15,980
Let's work together.

76
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,100
I need your support

77
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,550
to replace Qian Zhongli.

78
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,820
Why should I trust you?

79
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,340
You know

80
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,940
I'd never risk Luo's safety.

81
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,820
Hello, Miss Bai.

82
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,570
I heard

83
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,610
you used to be a songstress.

84
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,260
So how did you become
Mr. Luo's fiancée?

85
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,780
Just kidding.

86
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,390
Don't take it seriously.

87
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,220
Miss Lin, you're right.

88
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,500
I really don't deserve Mr. Luo.

89
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,340
I don't care about it.

90
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,850
You two seem really in love.

91
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,540
No wonder Mr. Luo would do anything

92
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,940
just to protect Miss Bai.

93
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,220
There were some misunderstandings.

94
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,820
Don't dwell on the past.

95
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,660
Cheers.

96
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,260
Miss Lin,

97
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,540
you seem pretty close

98
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,820
with Mr. Qian.

99
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,940
We're just business partners.

100
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,780
That's right.

101
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,450
I really like him.

102
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,010
What about Mr. Qian?

103
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,730
Do you like Miss Lin?

104
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,290
That doesn't matter.

105
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,610
All that matters is that I do.

106
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,540
Miss Lin and I have decided

107
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,260
to make a deal without Qian Zhongli.

108
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,820
This way, we can sideline Qian Zhongli.

109
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,410
If the Dock Gang helps out,

110
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,220
we'll have a better shot.

111
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,180
If we help you,

112
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,570
what's in it for us?

113
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,690
The benefit is

114
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,850
I spared your lives that day.

115
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,980
Do you really have a choice?

116
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,170
We have things to do.

117
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,220
Excuse me.

118
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,890
Come on, let's take a walk.

119
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,050
Honestly, I don't like
the opium business.

120
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:18,890
It's just not my thing.

121
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,570
I really like Lin City.

122
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,780
I'm planning to stay and invest here

123
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,460
with you by my side.

124
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,550
I'm not free
to show you around every day.

125
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,330
Keep the change.

126
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,330
Here you go.

127
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,530
It's not washed yet.

128
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,770
Now it's clean.

129
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,730
Does it taste good?

130
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,730
It's pretty good.

131
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,930
We don't have this fruit

132
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,470
