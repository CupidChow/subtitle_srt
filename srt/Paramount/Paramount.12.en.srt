and set fire to Muchen's warehouse.

26
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,050
Arrest him immediately.

27
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,620
That old man just won't quit.

28
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,130
Go to hell!

29
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,500
Mr. Qian, let us handle this.

30
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,690
Blame the Qians

31
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,090
if you want to blame someone.

32
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,780
Dad,

33
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,300
please calm down.

34
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,980
This is all your doing.

35
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,260
No, it's not.

36
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,100
It's because of him.

37
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,060
He stole from the QMG.

38
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,980
You've always tried to frame Muchen.

39
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,380
It's you,

40
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,060
always stirring up trouble.

41
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,100
Qian Muchen.

42
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,660
You really dared to hit me.

43
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,500
Dad.

44
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,900
This outsider

45
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,570
deserves to be behind bars.

46
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,410
- Enough.
- I...

47
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,730
Here's what we'll do.

48
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,010
From now on,

49
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,930
you're no longer

50
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,220
the Chairman of QMG.

51
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,890
Muchen will take over.

52
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,340
Dad,

53
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,650
I'm your real son.

54
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,370
Where am I supposed to go?

55
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:44,860
Well,

56
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,700
you should ask the new Chairman.

57
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,260
If Muchen

58
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,730
wants to keep you around,

59
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,620
then you can stay in the Guild.

60
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,490
Muchen.

61
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,650
Look,

62
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,180
we're all family.

63
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,140
We share the Qian family's blood.

64
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,730
Right?

65
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,490
Apologize to her.

66
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,010
Miss Bai,

67
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,460
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,060
It's my fault.

69
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,650
Grandpa.

70
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,530
My uncle keeps bothering my fiancée.

71
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,450
If he stays in Lin City,

72
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,580
I won't take over the Guild.

73
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,010
Dad,

74
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,700
you can't just listen to them.

75
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,910
Dad, I'm sorry.

76
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:01,890
I won't do it again.

77
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,060
I'll change, I promise.

78
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,620
- Give me another chance.
- Enough.

79
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,890
How about this,

80
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,530
you'll take over

81
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,530
the guild from out of town.

82
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,210
Get out right now.

83
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,890
Bufan.

84
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,460
Pack your things.

85
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:50,890
Leave now.

86
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,610
Alright.

87
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,450
Muchen,

88
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,650
after all,

89
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,420
he's still my son.

90
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,460
Since you want me to take over,

91
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,610
there must be a reason

92
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,860
you don't trust him anymore.

93
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,020
You just want me to say this for you.

94
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,040
Oh right,

95
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,740
I forgot to ask earlier.

96
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,700
Who is she?

97
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,580
Grandpa.

98
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,490
I'm Luo.

99
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,300
Luo?

100
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,260
You really are Luo?

101
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,980
Where have you been
all these years, kid?

102
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,900
After my dad passed away,

103
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,370
I moved out of town.

104
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,580
I just got back recently.

105
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,290
Glad that you're back.

106
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,930
Muchen just said you're his...

107
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,260
fiancée.

108
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,770
Are you engaged now?

109
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,100
I want to marry Luo.

110
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,330
Alright.

111
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,460
That sounds good.

112
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,330
Think of it as my way

113
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,530
of honoring your dad.

114
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,260
Take good care of Luo.

115
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,170
Young Master,

116
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,420
Mr. Qian asks you to come home.

117
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,490
He wants to see you alone.

118
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,090
Luo, head to Paramount first.

119
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,460
I'll wait for you.

120
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:58,890
Muchen.

121
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,860
I've noticed

122
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,400
how well you've done these years.

123
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,150
You've made a lot of money
for the Qian family.

124
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,460
In terms of business,

125
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,140
you're way better

126
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,390
than my own son.

127
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,530
So I was thinking,

128
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,180
what if you

129
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,370
became my successor?

130
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,460
Grandpa, I'm flattered.

131
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,860
It never occurs to me like that.

132
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,490
But since

133
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,460
I've entrusted the QMG to you,

134
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,860
I'll definitely

135
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,260
do my best to train you.

136
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,210
However,

137
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,930
if you want to be the heir,

138
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,370
you can't get involved with a songstress.

139
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,460
If you marry a songstress,

140
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,700
what kind of impression will we make

141
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,410
to the business community in Lin City?

142
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,050
Luo isn't...

143
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,140
Isn't good enough for you.

144
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,490
Call off the engagement.

145
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,180
By the way,

146
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,140
earlier,

147
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,900
that Vice Chairman who set you up

148
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,290
is about to leave Lin City.

149
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,370
You know,

150
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,780
how I've made it this far?

151
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,180
Because

152
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,700
I never forgive

153
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,540
those who betray me.

154
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,860
Young Master, we've brought him in.

155
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,660
Mr. Qian, please let me go.

156
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,500
I know I was wrong.

157
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,460
I was forced, Mr. Qian.

158
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,140
It was all under Qian Bufan's orders.

159
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,980
Mr. Qian, please, Mr. Qian.

160
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,370
I was so wrong.

161
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,970
I... I was forced into this.

162
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,260
I won't ever do it again.

163
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,660
Please, forgive me. I'm sorry!

164
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,490
He was involved in

165
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,570
Qian Bufan's opium dealing.

166
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,390
Qian Zhongli asked me to take over.

167
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,030
The timing is perfect.

168
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,260
We might be able to take

169
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,730
his trafficking network in one move.

170
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:30,810
What's wrong?

171
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,660
Qian Zhongli won't let me marry Luo.

172
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,970
This chance won't last long.

173
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,290
Maybe put your engagement

174
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,140
on hold for now.

175
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,660
Or,

176
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,730
get Miss Bai out of Lin City first.

177
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,780
Once things calm down,

178
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,410
bring her back then.

179
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,140
Mr. Liu.

180
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,540
- Welcome to Paramount.
- Yeah.

181
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,220
- We're truly honored.
- Thank you.

182
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,060
Miss Bai.

183
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,990
I have something to take care of.

184
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,340
- Excuse me.
- Go ahead.

185
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,380
Alright.
