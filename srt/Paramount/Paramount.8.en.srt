Mr. Qian, look at this.

50
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,700
She's trying to hurt you.

(Qian Merchant Guild)

53
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,980
you would have set me up.

54
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,620
Since you've already decided,

55
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,170
why even ask me?

56
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,140
Why are you helping Qian Bufan?

57
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,530
No matter what I say,
you won't believe me.

58
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,340
Want to punish me?

59
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,530
Do whatever you want.

60
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,290
What if I said I was forced?

61
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,060

62
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,260

63
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,500
You're still pretending?

64
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,810
How did you get hurt?

65
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,810
It was your uncle.

66
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,420
If I didn't frame you for him,

67
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,980

don't listen to her nonsense.

00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,010
- But I...
- Leave!

72
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,090
You should have told me sooner.

73
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,700
As your fiancée,

74
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,050

I face are endless.

75
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,840

(Qian Bufan invites you to the QMG.)

81

If you don't know why he likes me,

82
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,370

why he doesn't like you.

88

I have nothing to say to him.

89

I'm afraid you don't have a choice.

90

Sis, let's go, now.

92
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,750
Qian Bufan sent people after us.

93

Yes.

96
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,650
Go on.

97
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,210

Are you alright?

99
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,020

100
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,180
I didn't do what he told me.

101
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,930
Move in with me.

102
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,260

103
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,900

For now,

105
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,930
I can't fall out with him yet.

109
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,780
Mr. Qian, I'd like to work here.

110
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,100
Why's that?

111
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,420
Because

112
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,580
I want to earn money.

113
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,310
