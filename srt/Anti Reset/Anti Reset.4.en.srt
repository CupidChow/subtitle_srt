00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,877
So this is

00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,945
how it feels to have someone around.

5
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:52,285
Give it to me.

00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:53,953
Thank you.

7
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,582
Master, enjoy your breakfast.

00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,750
Thank you.

00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,961
History changes

10
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,163
because of different elements.

11
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,766
What was thought to be just a minor change

12
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,768
could have a massive impact,

13
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,105
which also creates the uniqueness
of history's existence.

14
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,591
Okay.

15
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:23,343

Do you want to come to school with me?

Can I?

39
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,015
Thank you, Master.

40
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,259
Let's go.

41
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,144
Master, do you like your job?

42
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:29,182
I hear that students nowadays
are hard to manage.

43
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,019
Apart from poor logic, bad expression,

44
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,787
and indigent argumentation skills,

45
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,355
everything else is fine.

46
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,626
Well, would you scold them?

47
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:42,895
No.

48
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,564
Learning is their responsibility.

49
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,566
I don't judge students based on grades.

50
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:53,206
Are you curious about going to school?

51
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,243
I have the data,

52
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,479
but I have never experienced

53
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,647
the feeling of sitting in the classroom

54
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,649
and attending class with classmates.

55
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,351
What I mean is

56
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,720
did you really go to school for classes?

57
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,356
I did not.

58
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,091
It's just a setting.

59
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,392
A situational setup.

60
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,895
It's okay.

61
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,097
You're always welcome in my class.

62
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,067
Hello, teacher.

63
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,237
Okay, we're about to be late.

64
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,438

65
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:29,041
What kind of student were you
when you were in school?

66
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,779
Reading, thinking, and taking tests.

67
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,615
Nothing special, I guess.

68
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,351
No, it sounds fun.

69
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,489
Didn't we agree not to call me 'Master' before?

70
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,258
Can your settings be changed?

71
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,760
I am your possession.

72
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,896
You can ask me to call you anything.

73
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:51,898
I've promised to treat you as a person.

74
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,033
Why do you still use the word 'possession'?

75
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,070
Well…

76
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,072
Honey.

77
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,112
Hasn't anyone told you
the meaning of this word?

78
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,081
It symbolizes submission.

79
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,751
It implies owning someone's life.

80
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,237
Listen to yourself.

81
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:16,756
I don't know what strange data
have been inputted into you.

82
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,426
Does he not like that?

83
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,161
Or is there something wrong?

84
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,796
Then,

85
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,766
what do you wish me to call you, Master?

86
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,435
Mr. Chu?

87
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:30,970
Professor Chu?

88
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,505
Chuchu?

00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,242

90
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,545
Pingping?

91
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,719
Bro.

92
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,656
Oppa.

93
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,726
Or…

94
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,328
baby?

95
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,267
You can decide

96
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,935
on what to call me.

97
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,802
Thank you.

98
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,575
You can sit over there.

99
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,288
Okay, class, we will begin.

100
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,923
Having studied history for so long,

101
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,592
you should be able to grasp

102
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,927
that during a person's lifetime,

103
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,496
it's almost impossible

104
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,164
to fully vindicate their experiences.

105
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,199
What we can do

106
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,534
is to try our best to make amends

107
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:09,902
within the long river of history.

108
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,672
Thus, historical revisionism

109
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,273
has its significance.

110
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:17,943
Everything I've experienced
has accumulated to who I am today.

111
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,680
History exists because it is remembered.

112
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,549
Oscar Wilde is a great example.

113
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,184
During his lifetime,

114
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,837
he faced a great deal of unfair treatment.

115
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:30,122

Hey, are you a transfer student?

122
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,290
But it's not the beginning of the semester now.

123
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,324
How come there is a transfer student?

124
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:06,792
Exactly.

125
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,360
What's your name?

126
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,863
You dare to take this mandatory history class.

127
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,131
I'm impressed.

128
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,567
I am Heng 9.

129
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:19,305
May I ask why it's bold to take this class?

130
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,674
You don't know?

131
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,811
You see, Professor Chu's is always serious.

132
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,480
And he asks sharp questions.

133
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,582
If you get called on in class,

134
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,717
you will be terribly tortured.

135
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,755
But though he has a stern face,
he is still very handsome.

136
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,756
Tell me honestly.

137
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,824
Did you take the class because you think
the professor is handsome too?

138
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,826
Stop being so infatuated.

139
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,862
Honey.

140
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,205
Ice-cold?

141
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,307
Perhaps the history and future of humans

142
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,409
may be revised due to differences

143
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,312
in experience and perspective.

144
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,049
You sound awfully like Professor Chu.

145
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,618
What's your relationship?

146
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,021
Cousin?

147
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,388
Sibling?

148
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,390
Distant relative?

149
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,859
Caregiver?

150
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:15,795
Bodyguard?

151
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,163
I'm not.

152
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,400
Or do you two have some kind of secret?

153
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,337
Wu Xiaojing,

154
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,439
if you could use

155
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,042
even one-tenth of your imagination
on your report,

156
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,544
it would surely be excellent.

157
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:34,613
Come here.

158
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,487
He is a dear younger brother of mine

159
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,022
who came to take care of me.

160
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,324
He will be with me for the next few weeks.

161
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,759
Don't you bully him.

00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:49,795

163
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,803
He's too cute.

164
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:58,904
Let's go. We'll be late.

Department of History

166
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,121
Last time when the Boss came,

167
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,524
I learned that you are afraid
of the smell of oil fumes,

168
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,025
and don't like to eat fried foods.

169
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,843
You took so many notes.

170
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,114
Taking notes

171
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,649
makes you seem more human.

172
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,623
So how was your first class?

173
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,126
Once the scenario is set,

174
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:57,196
it's only after actually experiencing something

175
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,064
that people's emotions can be stirred

176
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,900
by their immediate reactions.

177
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,835
Just like only after a pilot flies up

178
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,004
and truly touches the sky,

179
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,206
will one feel an indescribable emotion

180
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,942
due to that sense of vastness.

181
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:19,151
If we apply historical revisionism

182
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,153
to an individual,

183
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,955
does that mean

184
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,524
that when one's historical memory
is reorganized,

185
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,960
perhaps he can also construct new narratives

186
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,962
and redefine the future?

187
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,702
Can a person also construct new narratives?

188
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,245
You listened very carefully.

189
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,479
I've written down

190
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,881
every word you said.

191
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,653
Bro.

192
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,422
Don't walk so fast.

193
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,923
This isn't a stroll.

194
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,325
It's practically powerwalking.

195
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,460
You've decided to call me 'bro'.

196
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:05,064
Isn't that how you introduced
me to your classmates?

197
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,498
A dear younger brother.

198
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,237
I spent my time here

199
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,906
from college to doctoral classes.

200
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,909
That building is for Taiwanese history.

201
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,011
This one here is for world history.

202
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,346
I also took some classes

203
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,714
in historical philosophy back there.

204
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,850
And this is the legendary

205
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,986
Confession Lake

206
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,155
Legend says if two people
share their feelings here,

207
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,991
they will stay together for life.

208
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,961
I'm sure you have heard

209
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,963
many confessions here.

210
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,069
Professor.

211
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,371
This is for you.

212
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:47,606
Why me?

213
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:51,443
Because I think you're very smart
and serious, I admire that.

214
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,379
So if someone has the same qualities as me,

215
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,780
you would like them too.

216
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,549
I hope you'll think about it carefully.

217
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:58,984
Don't gamble your time and happiness

218
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:00,619
on someone's external attributes.

219
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,489
Mr. Chu.

220
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,358
I think we're quite suitable for each other.

221
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,895
- Why?
- Because our tastes are very similar.

222
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,897
It's worth a try.

223
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:15,067
Similar tastes do not
necessarily mean suitability.

224
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,668
Just like a high-end watch

225
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,737
isn't necessarily suitable for everyone.

226
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,343
Yiping.

227
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,245
You've been single for so long.

228
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,080
How about we try to be together?

229
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,481
What's the purpose?

230
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,316
Humans are social animals.

231
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,286
Two single people should
be together for warmth.

232
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,989
If it's cold, you can turn on the heater.

233
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,991
This is not what it means
for two people to be together.

234
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,863
When in a relationship,

235
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,532
a person's voice and body

236
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,534
would be very different from the usual.

237
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,505
From a neurological perspective,

238
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,641
being in love rewards the brain.

239
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,109
The brain secretes many substances

240
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,277
such as dopamine,

241
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,611
making people happy.

242
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,349
Have you ever been in love, Master?

243
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,554
No.

244
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,224
Why?

245
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,060
Aren't you curious?

246
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,796
Would the dopamine triggered by love

247
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,331
or hormones

248
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,767
cause changes in the human body

249
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:26,872
in the same way

250
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,074
as what was experienced virtually?

251
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,611
So, in your settings,

252
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,613
is there a virtual love experience?

253
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,417
To what extent?

254
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:42,688
Come here.

255
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,190
Be careful.

256
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,127
Don't move.

257
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,901
Do you feel anything at this distance?

258
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,409
The social safety distance of 1.5 meters.

259
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:07,212
It's polite, maintaining a comfortable space.

260
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,418
If it is someone you are closer to,

261
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,356
they can get this close,

262
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,260
0.46 meters.

263
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,775
As for the closest distance,

264
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,417
0.15 meters.

265
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,926
If you feel a difference,

266
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,928
it means your virtual experience

267
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,930
was quite close to reality.

268
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,022
My database shows

269
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,791
when humans kiss,

270
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,026
seventeen sets of muscles
in the lips and tongue

271
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,028
will be in a tense state.

272
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:34,333
This proves that my data seems to differ

273
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,867

So this is the correct way to use muscles.

284

Does this count as understanding
each other's intentions?

[Making Virtual Experience Closer to Reality]

286
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,962
Would adding so many parameters

287
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:12,848
make it break down easily?

288
00:22:12,848 --> 00:22:14,566
I don't know.

289
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,469
As the first artificial intelligence
with so many sensors,

290
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,738
we can only test and see where its limits are.

291

What's the point of that?

293

His function is to provide care.
