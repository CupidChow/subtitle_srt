3
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:12,145
The results should come out this time, right?

4
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,781
Test results show emotions of sadness and anger

5
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,483
don't affect him much.

6
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,853
But there is one value that's really strange.

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,388
What?

8
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,625
His tolerance for love is quite low.

9
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:26,893
Why is that?

10
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:30,497
After all, he is an AI
with emotional tendencies.

11
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,232
He should give love to his master,

12
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,833
instead of receiving.

13
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,403
Such a setting should be quite reasonable.

14
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,938
If we encounter issues, we'll ask the boss.

15
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:41,307
So it turns out

16
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:44,277
love is such a painful thing.

17
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:49,182
But it's unlikely that a master would give
so much love to artificial intelligence.

18
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,984
Consider it a pass on the test.

19
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,186

Okay?

185
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,619
You're mine now.

186
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,022
You have to hold your ground.

187
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,224
But to me,

188
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,959
you're more than just a product.

189
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:57,362
You are irreplaceable and one of a kind.

190
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,498
No. 9.

191
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,233
Why did you record without permission

192
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,902
and marked it undeletable?

193
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:08,740
Alright.

194
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,276
Today's demonstration teaching ends here.

195
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,512
Chu Yiping.

196
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,048
You don't mingle with people.

197
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,351
Are you going to fall in love with an AI?

198
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,122
When I sent No. 9 over,

199
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:26,959
did it help you or hurt you?

200
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,798
Boss, just implant this chip into Heng 9,

201
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,666
and he can be RESET.

202
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,668
Should we implant it right away?

203
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,783
During these days I was away,

204
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,685
did you not eat well again?

205
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,789
I tried doing it myself,

206
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,524
but it doesn't seem to work.

207
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,895
Can you cook for me?

208
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,599
But it tastes awful.

209
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:13,205
But I really want to try your cooking.

210
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,741
Please?

211
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,075
Dear.

212
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:20,512
Okay.

213
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,947
Wait for me.

214
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,423
Are you alright?

215
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,464
My database shows

216
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,866
humans do this when they get burned

217
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,535
to alleviate the pain.

218
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,771
Did you look up the wrong information?

219
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,507
Shouldn't people be touching their ears?

220
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:41,026
I'll take it from here.

221
00:22:56,608 --> 00:23:00,512
Even if one day I can't be by your side,

222
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,881
you still have to take care.

223
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,306
What's wrong?

224
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,676
Can we sleep together?

225
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,446
You don't need to sleep.

226
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,681
You're not going to watch me
all night, are you?

227
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:38,950
And I remember the wish list

228
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,952
doesn't seem to include this.

229
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,288
Yes, it does.

230
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,490
I just added it.

231
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,758
Now that you put it that way,

232
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,360
how can I say no?

233
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,030
Come on.

234
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,048
Listening to your heartbeat like this,

235
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,683
it's so loud.

236
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,120
It has to beat.

237
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,858
This must be the sound of a heart fluttering.

238
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,695
Would your heart

239
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,096
beat faster

240
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,666
because of me?

241
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,717
Do you want to try

242
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:48,353
something we haven't done before?

243
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,965
I just want to remind you

244
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,034
that I have additional functions.

245
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:24,523
But actually, I'm not experienced.

246
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:26,958
It's okay.

247
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,094
Let me do it.

00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,203
I thought you had disappeared.

255
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:34,552
What you activated was not
an additional function.

256
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,455
It's love.

257
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:38,556
Right?

258
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:49,668
A kiss on the hair means longing,

259
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,706
on the ear, temptation,

260
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,279
on lips, love,

261

262
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,723

belongs to me.

265
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,147

not to challenge your man's willpower

I'm begging you.

275
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:23,895
Could all these

276
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,830
possibly be illusions created by settings?

277
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,098
You didn't take good care of me.

278
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,166
You left me behind.

279
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,868
That's very irresponsible.

00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:32,337
