It doesn't matter whether I like it or not.

188
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,353
My life from my birth to the age of 80

189
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,856
was constructed in a database.

190
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,358
Those settings are all very vague.

191
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,727
That's why I envy your lives.

192
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,597
But I know that's not right.

193
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,900
In the beautifully literary terms of humanity,

194
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,902
it's a luxury.

195
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,907
What will you be doing when you're 80?

196
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:00,412
The system's design is very traditional.

197
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,182
It's probably a scene like that.

198
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,253
With company.

199
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,255
What does he look like?

200
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,659
It doesn't matter what he looks like.

201
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,494
After all, it's all virtual.

202
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,371
You once said

203
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,808
that everything we've gone through
has created the present,

204
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,443
and then accumulated to become me.

205
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,079
So I consider myself very fortunate

206
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,081
to be by your side.

207
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,118
If after a long, long time,

208
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,453
the person by your side is still me,

209
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,689
that would be even better.

210
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,558
We could grow old together.

211
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,529
But my appearance can't age.

212
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,899
Wouldn't we look strange when the time comes?

213
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,802
I don't know if Boss will solve it for us.

214
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,173
But if we have to change the shell,

215
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,942
wouldn't that be expensive?

216
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,379
What should we do then?

217
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,918
Do you have any wishes?

218
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,360
Wishes?

219
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,557
What wishes do you have? Tell me.

220
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,292
Let's fulfill them together.

221
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:25,064
My wish is to fulfill your wishes.

222
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,299
You are an independent entity.

223
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,501
You can also have your own wishes.

224
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,239
None of us own anyone.

225
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,775
So, you should care more about yourself.

226
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,846
Isn't it a bug

227
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:43,449
to make choices

228
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,284
following one's consciousness?

229
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,520
Human emotions

230
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,156
do not belong to any string
of numbers or coding.

231
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,392
And the way this world operates

232
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,728
never has a correct answer to begin with.

233
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,731
So you don't have to live
according to the original settings.

234
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,236
Can I really do that?

235
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,489
Do you have any place in mind you'd like to go?

236
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,127
I want to go to the riverbank.

237
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,628
The riverbank?

238
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,698
Okay, I'll look it up.

239
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,249
Your wish is to come here.

240
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,884
I've always been curious.

241
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:57,022
Although this place is dark, smelly,
infested with mosquitoes,

242
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,458
and full of various dangers,

243
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,647
and the behavior of couples

244
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,382
has no value whatsoever,

245
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:26,118
why does everyone still enjoy it tirelessly?

246
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,755
That might be because

247
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,924
you don't have much experience with love.

248
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,229
Come on.

249
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,931
Consider it a return for your care.

250
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,233
Hold hands, and feel it.

251
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,879
How is it?

252
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,647
Do you feel anything different?

253
00:16:56,382 --> 00:17:00,219
The way you hold hands
is like an adult holding a child's hand.

254
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,988
It lacks a romantic touch.

255
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,090
It should be like this.

256
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,570
Although you're not used
to someone holding your hand,

257
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,839
I hope that when I'm with you,

258
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,841
we can keep holding hands.

259
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,781
Let's go.

260
00:17:33,264 --> 00:17:38,128
♫ I hide in yesterday
where there's no fuss or noise ♫

261
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:43,072
♫ I don't rehearse your silly laughter ♫

262
00:17:43,072 --> 00:17:47,785
[Holding on without letting go]
♫ Just wondering what your hugs would feel like ♫

263
00:17:47,785 --> 00:17:54,535
♫ Keep the heartbeat
of your love for me in mind ♫

264
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,961
♫ Fortunately, you don't know ♫

265
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:42,720
♫ Just like the bell that jingles
as you lift your head ♫

266
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,458
♫ My intense longing burns ♫

267
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,768
♫ Tears trace the corners of my eyes ♫

268
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:51,713
♫ Like an overheated tsunami ♫

269
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:56,185
♫ Fortunately, you don't know ♫

270
00:18:56,206 --> 00:19:01,570
♫ I hide in yesterday
where there's no fuss or noise ♫

271
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:06,005
♫ I don't rehearse your silly laughter ♫

272
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:10,629
♫ Just wondering what your hugs
would feel like ♫

273
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:18,648
♫ Keep the heartbeat
of your love for me in mind ♫

274
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,274
We are both very cute.

275
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,427
Writing notes.

276
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:56,995
What era are we in?

277
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,697
I thought you'd send your wish list

278
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,699
via a message.

279
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,135
This is called a sense of ceremony.

280
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:07,506
And it feels more personal this way.

281
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,044
Is printing out photos the same?

282
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,882
I've seen the photo frames in your room.

283
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,152
You were smiling so happily in them,

284
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,154
just like you are now.

285
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:29,761
Don't humans always care
about the sense of ceremony?

286
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,597
Don't you?

287
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,334
I'm curious about what's in your head.

288
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,174
Einstein said that emotions and desires

289
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,109
are the driving force

290
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,744
behind all human efforts and creation.

291
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,746
In this definition,

292
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,681
Heng 9 with desires

293
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,683
is more human-like than I am.

294
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,772
You can't give me away to someone else.

295
00:20:56,772 --> 00:20:59,558
You know, I will only have you in here.

296
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:00,726
There won't be anyone else.

297
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,061
Since you've chosen to wear this to swim today,

298
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,224
you might as well skip eating.

299
00:21:04,224 --> 00:21:05,314
You'll gain weight.

300
00:21:05,314 --> 00:21:07,532
If life just stops here forever,

301
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:08,734
that would also be fine.

302
00:21:19,126 --> 00:21:26,270
♫ Turns out that a long time is not forever ♫

303
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,862
♫ A hand held for so long ♫

304
00:21:28,862 --> 00:21:32,904
