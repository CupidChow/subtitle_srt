♫ You cuddle by my side day and night ♫

7
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:50,401
♫ Wishing to nestle against your cheek ♫

8
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:54,349
♫ Looking at what you're gazing ♫

00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:05,130
♫ I want to step into your time ♫

♫ Forever and always ♫

18
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:18,998
It's okay.

19
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,800
That was just a teaching experience.

20
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,843
Do you have trouble sleeping?

21
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,581
I don't need to sleep.

22
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,242
Actually,

23
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,744
I'm not ready yet.

24
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:12,352
Then let's just chat under the quilt.

25
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,137
The quilt is now on.

26
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,973
What would you like to talk about, Master?

27
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,711
Now that you mention it,

28
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,080
I seem to have no experience in chatting.

29
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:45,685
You don't have experience
chatting under a quilt?

30
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,754
That's right.

31
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,622
The boss did mention

32
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:53,426
that you spent all your time
studying and taking exams.

33
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,096
Before you came,

34
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,766
what exactly did my uncle say?

35
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,136
This kid doesn't like people,

36
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,637
nor does he get close to anyone.

37
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,774
He insists on doing everything by himself

38
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,909
even though he clearly can't.

39
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,212
What to do if this continues?

40
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:15,315
But if it's Heng 9,

41
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,050
there should be no problem, right?

42
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,652
Should we give it a try?

43
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,924
Can everything be replayed just like that?

44
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,660
Do you have a large memory capacity?

45
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,129
What happens if you reboot?

46
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:37,804
I am basically just a very powerful computer.

47
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:41,607
If one day I need to reboot,

48
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,910
that would probably be
because I've broken down.

49
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:48,281
In that case, the software
would have to be reinstalled,

50
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,283
and the hardware sent for repair.

51
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,692
Would you mind that I am not a real person

52
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,694
and not befriend me?

53
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,735
Of course not.

54
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,436
So don't ever say again

55
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,772
that you are just a computer.

56
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,641
Okay?

57
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:42,201
Heng 9.

58
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,936
Can you hear me?

59
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,640
Can you hear me now?

60

♫ Nothing was said ♫

61
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:39,541
♫ Everything was understood ♫

00:07:40,576 --> 00:07:43,122
♫ That is him ♫

♫ I think I won't forget ♫

67
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:05,017
Everything in this world follows
specific trajectories of operation.

68
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,921
History may not repeat itself,

69
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,224
but there are always astonishing similarities.

70
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,262
I'm off to work.

71
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,508
The professor had a super grumpy face today.

72
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,809
I told you so.

73
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,044
It was a one-time thing.

74
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,546
But it's strange.

75
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,081
That new student didn't show up.

76
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,983
Right, he said just a few weeks ago

77
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,584
that he would attend classes together.

78
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,319
He didn't seem smart.

79
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,421
Must have been useless and got driven away.

80
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,897
The variable factors that shouldn't be added

81
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,598
should be eliminated as early as possible,

82
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:53,900
right?

83
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,182
Professor.

84
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,251
Professor, you're back, Professor.

85
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,819
Professor.

86
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,656
Let me sort it out for you.

87
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,193
Professor, wait a moment.

88
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,929
Your tie is crooked. Let me adjust it for you.

89
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,464
It's okay, I can do it myself.

90
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,867
But there is a seminar later, come on.

91
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,435
I'll do it myself.

92
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:36,142
Professor.

93
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,068
Look who is calling.

94
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:05,438
I was startled when I saw your number just now.

95
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,505
My dear nephew,

96
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,032
what's up?

97
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,042
Let's eat.

98
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,013
You've finally thought of repaying your uncle.

99
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,749
I'll pick an expensive one for you in a bit.

100
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,830
I will be late today.

101
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,575
I won't come back for dinner tonight.

102
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,019
What am I doing?

103
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,454
He's just a simulated human.

♫ Fortunately, you don't know ♫

105
00:11:04,015 --> 00:11:09,067
♫ Just like the bell that jingles
as you lift your head ♫

106

♫ Like an overheated tsunami ♫

109
00:11:17,536 --> 00:11:21,753
♫ Fortunately, you don't know ♫

110
00:11:21,753 --> 00:11:27,353
♫ I hide in yesterday
where there's no fuss or noise ♫

111
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,761
You haven't asked me out to eat in centuries.

112
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,363
I just dropped everything at hand

113
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,864
and rushed over to accompany you.

114
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,766
Why aren't you eating?

115
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:41,834
Do you want me to feed you?

116
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,436
I have hands.

117
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,240
Is it that the dishes Heng 9
made were so delicious

118
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,242
that you won't even deign to look at them?

119
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:56,415
Why did you design
the HengRen series in the first place?

120
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,417
I've said before

121
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,419
that each model has different functions.

122
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,721
Like the Heng 9 model

123
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,357
will be used for emotional
disorder therapy in the future.

124
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,993
Its main function is emotional care.

125
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,529
It will respond precisely

126
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,798
to the user based on the input data.

127
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:13,799
What do you think?

128
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,935
The data analysis and responses
over the past few days

129
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,770
should all be quite good, right?

130
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,608
Will the HengRen series be recycled?

131
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:23,776
What do you plan to do

132
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,778
with these artificial intelligences afterward?

133
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,781
You sound so interested.

134
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:31,217
It must be because
our Heng 9 is really good, isn't it?

135
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,919
Feedback from other users is also quite good,

136
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,455
apart from a few minor bugs.

137
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,225
What if the HengRen series breaks down?

138
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,793
What would you do?

139
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:44,764
Minor damage means a reset is needed.

140
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,033
If it's serious, it has to be replaced.

141
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,603
Replacing things when they're broken,
do you have a conscience?

142
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,507
Why such a big reaction?

143
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,610
Just think of it as a

144
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,446
more sophisticated flagship computer.

145
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,714
Of course, it's a pity if it breaks.

146
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:02,782
After all, it is an experimental product.

147
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,617
That's the only way it can be.

148
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,684
Why are you so angry?

149
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:09,021
Let me tell you, humanitarianism
doesn't apply here.

150
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,956
You can treat it as a friend if you want,

151
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,658
but it is not a human after all.

152
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,860
Moreover, apart from your hand,

153
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,496
its additional function is to heal your psyche

154
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,564
so that when you interact with people,

155
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,666
you can be a bit happier.

156
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:15,621
Unable to resonate with the crowd,

00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,595
That's the real joke, isn't it?

160
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:06,205
The company says the product
must have a vulnerability setting

161
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,540

184
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:59,818
I thought you would be back in the afternoon.

185
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,221
Its main function is emotional care.

186
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,690
It will respond precisely

187
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,693
to the user based on the input data.

188
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,831
You thought…

189
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,501
I'm back now.

190
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,136
And then?

191
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,907
All this is just a precise calculation.

192
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,143
Artificial intelligence,

193
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,644
right?

194
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,392
Can I do this to you?

195
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,594
Or that?

196
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,497
Anyone can do anything to you.

197
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,240
Have you been drinking?

198
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,544
Your hand hasn't healed yet.

199
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,145
You shouldn't be drinking.

200
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,884
Are you feeling uncomfortable somewhere?

201
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,991
I'm just drunk.

202
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,961
Such data has no reference value.

203
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,130
It's okay, you don't need to record it.

204
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,972
Haru.

206
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,855
I'm still trapped in that day's loss.

00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,992
I'm always angry at this world.

00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,286
He's just manufactured.

213
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:50,222
He shouldn't bear my unexplainable emotions.

214
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,498
What is the master really thinking?

215
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,968
Why can't I analyze it?

216
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:06,004
Is it sadness?

217
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,774
Is it loss?

218
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,643
Is it anger?

219
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,347
Or is it boredom?

220
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,586
What's really wrong with the Master?

221
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,188
Why can't I analyze it?

222
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:37,869
Heng 9, just now…

223
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,972
I'm sorry.

224
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,407
I overstepped.

225
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,180
When I didn't know where you went

226
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,649
or when you were coming back,

227
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:56,221
I felt sadness, loss, and anger.

228
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,223
And I even let these emotions

229
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,225
affect you.

230
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,394
I know,

231
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:05,631
I'm not a very competent
artificial intelligence.

232
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,436
But please don't be angry.

233
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,707
Please don't send me back.

234
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,511
I'm still learning.

235
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,448
I will get better.

236
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:34,693
I won't throw you away.

237
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:41,867
Actually, I went to see my uncle today,

238
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,970
wanting to keep you.

239
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,542
But instead, I got scolded by him.

240
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,415
He told me

241
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:57,683
that you were just

242
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,118
an artificial intelligence designed in a lab.

243
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,921
But to me,

244
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,324
you are more than just a product.

245
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,594
You are irreplaceable and one of a kind.

246
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,331
I often think

247
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,866
that if one day you break down

248
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,069
or get recycled,

249
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,271
what should I do then?

250
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:36,521
Today, when I came back
and saw you sitting there,

251
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,892
I was thinking that if one day,

252
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,595
you are RESET to the next owner,

253
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,565
would you also

254
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,567
wait there for them to return?

255
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,773
You would forget everything we've been through.

256
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,409
But I will remember everything.

257
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:03,448
At that time, I will be alone,

258
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,052
wondering what Heng 9 is doing now.

259
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,422
If Heng 9 is still by my side,

260
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:13,058
we still have so many things
we could do together.

261
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,998
I would never leave you.

262
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,301
Stop overthinking things.

263
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,473
I won't let you be alone.

264
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,543
