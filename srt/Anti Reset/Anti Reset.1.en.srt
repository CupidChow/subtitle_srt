Hello, this is a delivery
from Hengji Intelligent Development.

00:00:46,076 --> 00:00:49,512
It requires Mr. Chu Yiping's signature.

[Episode 1 The First Day of Receiving Goods]

5
00:01:07,654 --> 00:01:13,746
♫ You cuddle by my side day and night ♫

6
00:01:13,746 --> 00:01:17,838
♫ Wishing to nestle against your cheek ♫

7
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:22,287
♫ Looking at what you're gazing ♫

8
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:28,271
♫ You make the static life different ♫

9
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:32,787
♫ I want to step into your time ♫

10
00:01:32,787 --> 00:01:36,768
♫ And backup all the scenes ♫

11
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:43,731
♫ Your smile brightens up my entire universe ♫

12
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:47,379
♫ I want to dream the dream you wish to dream ♫

13
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:51,455
♫ Strolling under the starry sky ♫

14
00:01:51,455 --> 00:01:58,356
♫ On what grounds can I hold your hand ♫

15
00:01:58,356 --> 00:02:02,391
♫ You're my eternal love evermore ♫

[AntiReset]

18
00:02:12,576 --> 00:02:15,200
- Professor.
- Xiaojing. [Department of History]

19
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,702
Why did you choose to teach history?

20
00:02:19,604 --> 00:02:22,407
Why did you choose to study history?

21
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:24,743
Because I am poor at mathematics and sciences.

22
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:27,045
But I am good at memorizing things.

23
00:02:27,045 --> 00:02:29,780
I like history because of its accumulated certainty.

24
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,883
Raymond Claude Ferdinand Aron once said that history always serves life.

25
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:36,288
It provides examples, evaluates the past,

26
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:40,222
or puts the current moment into the unfolding of its becoming.

27
00:02:40,222 --> 00:02:43,495
What about historical revisionism?

28
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:48,967
Denial comes from disagreement.

29
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:52,702
If one agrees,denial won't exist.
[Department of History]

30
00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:57,409
History is a play without an ending.

31
00:02:57,409 --> 00:02:59,711
Every scenario that seems like an ending

32
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:02,580
is the beginning of a new episode.

33
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:06,051
Just as Romain Rolland believed,

34
00:03:06,051 --> 00:03:09,721
history is written for the living.

35
00:03:10,522 --> 00:03:14,159
Having rifled through the dead's pockets,

36
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,061
the living move on
over the corpses of the dead.

37
00:03:49,027 --> 00:03:51,029
Professor.

38
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:52,720
Xiaojing.

39
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:01,004
I'm sorry. Professor, are you okay?

40
00:04:01,004 --> 00:04:02,774
Is there an emergency?

41
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:06,909
I…I just wanted to give you this century cake

42
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:08,413
and savor the taste of history together.
- Thank you for your kindness.

43
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:09,481
Thank you for your kindness.

44
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:11,249
But I don't really eat these.

45
00:04:11,783 --> 00:04:13,418
Let's go.

46
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:18,390
Come on.

47
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:31,668
I'm heading to the hospital. I will skip
the department meeting this evening.

48
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:35,307
Professor, what's wrong? I'll go with you to the hospital.

49
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:37,042
No, thank you.

50
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:39,064
Professor.

51
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:58,430
Why didn't you reply to your uncle's messages?

52
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,731
Busy.

53
00:04:59,731 --> 00:05:02,200
How has your week been?

54
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:05,170
Nothing special.

55
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,472
Don't try to dismiss me in 30 seconds.

56
00:05:07,472 --> 00:05:10,075
Class is over, right? What were you doing just now?

57
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:12,644
What took you so long to answer the phone?

58
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:14,246
I'm on the way to the hospital.

59
00:05:14,246 --> 00:05:16,581
I might have a dislocated shoulder.

60
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:18,583
You're injured?

61
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:21,819
Excuse me, we can go now.

62
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:33,632
How did you end up like this?

63
00:05:33,632 --> 00:05:35,667
Saving someone.

64
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,436
I was saving someone. It was an accident.

65
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:41,438
A student jumped on me. It was either my dislocation or her falling down the stairs.

66
00:05:41,438 --> 00:05:43,808
What a caring professor.

67
00:05:43,808 --> 00:05:46,211
Are you sure there's no need for surgery?

68
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:48,346
I would be hospitalized that way.

69
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:50,081
I don't have the time.

70
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,051
Then I will act as your left hand.

71
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:55,186
Come on, I'll do it.

72
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:05,497
Let's go

73
00:06:05,497 --> 00:06:07,431
I can walk by myself.

74
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,388
It's so inconvenient missing one hand.

75
00:06:30,388 --> 00:06:31,923
Do you want me to hire a nurse for you?

76
00:06:31,923 --> 00:06:34,659
No need, I can manage on my own.

77
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:37,228
No way.

78
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:39,698
Eating, drinking, and going
to the bathroom using one hand.

79
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:41,499
What if it becomes a habitual dislocation?

80
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:43,667
Let me tell you. If not cared for properly,

81
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:45,970
you might suffer
from a frozen shoulder when you're older.

82
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:52,243
Or do you want me to take care of you?

83
00:06:52,243 --> 00:06:53,311
No, it won't work. I'm a man, heavy and coarse.

84
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:55,780
I'm a man, heavy and coarse.

85
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,382
I can do it alone.

86
00:06:57,382 --> 00:06:59,117
Alone, alone.

87
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:00,452
Why be alone at this time?

88
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:02,654
This child is so annoying.

89
00:07:02,654 --> 00:07:05,056
History has made him insensitive.

90
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:07,192
I didn't ask you to like me.

91
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:10,095
Okay.

92
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:12,130
That's not what I meant.

93
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,664
Come on.

94
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:17,068
Your parents don't dislike you.

95
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:20,538
They just prefer doing scientific research.

96
00:07:20,538 --> 00:07:23,774
In the whole world, I care for you the most.

97
00:07:26,477 --> 00:07:29,078
Come on, have a seat. - I'll go get you some water.
- I can walk on my own.

98
00:07:29,113 --> 00:07:31,349
Okay, you sit down then.

99
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:34,219
I'll get your medicine for you.

100
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:36,287
It's time to take your medicine.

101
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:55,173
Come on.

102
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:58,608
Made with love. Eat while it's hot.

103
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:09,354
I have been boiling water and making
instant noodles myself since young.

104
00:08:09,354 --> 00:08:12,457
Your love seems a bit casual.

105
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:13,792
So you say.

106
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:16,628
Look at how empty your fridge is.

107
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:19,164
What else did you expect?

108
00:08:19,164 --> 00:08:20,799
It's been a few years since you moved in.

109
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:23,168
But your house looks as empty as a model home.

110
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:24,969
Are you even human?

111
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:28,973
Yes.

112
00:08:28,973 --> 00:08:32,243
I can give you a spot as a tester.

113
00:08:32,243 --> 00:08:34,011
What do you mean?

114
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:39,817
The company's developed robots
are undergoing secret tests.

115
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:43,254
If it's not human, your sense of rejection won't be as strong.

116
00:08:43,254 --> 00:08:46,789
It also happens to be a model designed to be used in the future

117
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:49,427
for patients with emotional disorders.

118
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:52,162
You can be a tester. Give us some feedback.

119
00:08:52,162 --> 00:08:54,665
Emotional disorders? Me?

120
00:08:54,665 --> 00:08:57,068
You have to learn to get along with people.

121
00:08:57,068 --> 00:08:59,037
Even if you want to be single for life,

122
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:02,440
when you are old, can't walk, and need diapers,

123
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,310
you'll need to get along with your caregiver.

124
00:09:07,545 --> 00:09:09,414
Let me see.

125
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:12,283
I have a business trip tomorrow.

126
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:15,220
Okay, then. I'll have it delivered to you.

127
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,121
And don't go running around this week.

128
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:20,525
I'll have He Li call in sick for you at school.

129
00:09:20,525 --> 00:09:21,959
Done.

130
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:24,629
Are you done?

131
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,703
- This was made for me.

132
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,804
- But you weren't eating it.
- If you want to eat, go and make another.

133
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:23,388
Hello, this is a delivery
from Hengji Intelligent Development.

134
00:10:24,555 --> 00:10:27,392
It requires Mr. Chu Yiping's signature.

135
00:10:58,189 --> 00:10:59,891
Is this the item?

136
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:03,695
Although we have confirmed
your appearance and identity,

137
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:07,363
allow me to ask again, are you Mr. Chu Yiping?

138
00:11:07,363 --> 00:11:09,767
A signature in person is needed.

139
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:11,336
Confirmed?

140
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:13,171
Have we met before?

141
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:16,572
Or are they so considerateto attach my photo to the delivery?

142
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,010
Hello, I am Product No.9 from HengRen series of Hengji Intelligent Development.

143
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,411
of Hengji Intelligent Development.

144
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:22,380
Since your limb is currently impaired, the company has already completed
the initial setup for me.

145
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,949
the company has already completed
the initial setup for me.

146
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:28,984
Mr. Wei Heng said you find it a hassle so you surely won't mind.

147
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:42,700
The company's developed robots
are undergoing secret tests.

148
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,135
If it's not a human,your sense of rejection won't be as strong.

149
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:54,078
You are a robot?

150
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:57,315
I am AI artificial intelligence.

151
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:07,258
Uncle. Playing big, huh?

152
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:11,496
In order to get me a nurse, you even got a real person disguised as a robot delivered to the doorstep?

153
00:12:11,496 --> 00:12:13,164
Does Hengji now have
a talent agency department?

154
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:14,766
You got the delivery.

155
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:16,501
It looks like a human, right?

156
00:12:16,501 --> 00:12:18,903
I was stunned when I first saw it.

157
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:20,138
Try touching it for me.

158
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:25,106
This series is integrated with Hengji's humanoid art skills.

159
00:12:59,677 --> 00:13:02,045
That's the switch. Do not touch it casually.

160
00:13:02,045 --> 00:13:04,215
A force shutdown would occur.

161
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,227
Mr. Chu. Do you always communicate with people

162
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:17,895
in such distance at the door?

163
00:13:17,895 --> 00:13:19,397
May we enter first?

164
00:13:19,397 --> 00:13:21,966
Then I will explain to you
my method of application.

165
00:13:23,735 --> 00:13:26,569
Okay. Please come in.

166
00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:00,938
Technology has really advanced nowadays.

167
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:15,553
There are a few questions
I need to understand first.

168
00:14:16,554 --> 00:14:18,690
Do you need to eat?

169
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,659
Or, must you eat?

170
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:25,530
Charging should suffice, right?

171
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,566
Otherwise, how would you digest it?

172
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:31,269
Does your data need to be updated regularly?

173
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:33,371
Do you feel heat or cold?

174
00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:36,107
Does this hurt?

175
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:38,342
How advanced is your intelligence?

176
00:14:53,825 --> 00:14:55,493
Hello, Mr. Chu.

177
00:14:55,493 --> 00:14:58,129
I formally introduce myself to you.

178
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:01,264
I am the latest product
of the confidentiality group from Hengji Intelligent Development Division,

179
00:15:01,264 --> 00:15:03,000
HengRen Series No. 9.

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,403
You may call me Heng 9.

181
00:15:05,403 --> 00:15:09,106
My purpose is to accompany and assist clients with physical disabilities.

182
00:15:09,106 --> 00:15:13,945
Whether it's daily living, nursing care, companionship, or entertainment,

183
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:16,347
they all fall within my range of services.

184
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:20,616
I would like you
to understand the product first before using it.

185
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:28,558
I am 100% anthropomorphic, indistinguishable from humans in daily life.

186
00:15:28,558 --> 00:15:30,428
Anything a human can do, I can do it.

187
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:33,197
As for how to execute it, that is a company secret.

188
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:35,500
I'm sorry I cannot explain it to you.

189
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,603
As for what you were curious about just now, this is a light energy receiver.

190
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:40,304
It can automatically store energy,

191
00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:44,439
and is also the most important energy nexus on me.

192
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:48,646
Currently, the foundation of my database has been input based on my growth background.

193
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:50,147
I am 22 years old.

194
00:15:50,147 --> 00:15:52,049
At four, I attended
the Happy Hengji Kindergarten.

195
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:54,685
At seven, I was in class nine,
grade one, at Hengji Primary School.

196
00:15:54,685 --> 00:15:57,453
At eight, I became the class president. At nine, I was chosen as a model student.

197
00:15:57,453 --> 00:16:00,456
At 18, I went to university and studied Life Sciences and Technology.

198
00:16:00,456 --> 00:16:02,793
In my sophomore year,
I joined the Coffee Research Club.

199
00:16:02,793 --> 00:16:07,565
Currently, after graduation, I plan to…
- So, you did attend classes,

200
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:11,199
I mean, did you really go to school for classes?

201
00:16:13,237 --> 00:16:14,739
I did not.

202
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:18,340
It's just a setting. A situational setup.

203
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:39,027
You just said that you can do everything humans can.

204
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:24,875
Mr. Zhu, you really like shaking hands.

205
00:17:31,048 --> 00:17:35,317
Could it be that this producthas a hypnotic effect?

206
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:44,595
Anyway, how it operates is the utmost secret.

207
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:46,364
Don't try to pry anything out of me.

208
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:49,000
Besides, let me tell you, you are really lucky.

209
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,734
Among the nine models developed this time,

210
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:52,637
others all have individual testers,

211
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:55,406
but this one with perfect
emotion management scores

212
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:57,274
was just left for you.

213
00:17:57,274 --> 00:18:00,544
And I had my secretary input a lot of data,

214
00:18:00,544 --> 00:18:03,780
guaranteeing his reactions won't irritate you.

215
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:07,618
How long is the testing period?

216
00:18:07,618 --> 00:18:10,321
There's no need to fill in
any experience log, right?

217
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:13,758
It seems you are not
planning to return the product.

218
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:15,493
It can be returned?

219
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:17,028
Nope.

220
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:19,829
At least he can help keep an eye on you,
the one-armed professor

221
00:18:19,829 --> 00:18:21,198
so that I don't have to worry.

222
00:18:21,198 --> 00:18:23,634
Just make good use of him.

223
00:18:23,634 --> 00:18:26,137
Don't worry about wearing it out.
Use it well and freely.

224
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:27,604
Bye-bye.

225
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:12,283
Mr. Wei Heng said your refrigerator was empty

226
00:19:12,283 --> 00:19:15,085
and asked me to bring over some groceries.

227
00:19:16,954 --> 00:19:18,322
Thank you.

228
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:36,237
So…Does that make you my master now?

229
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,016
If not, am I not allowed to eat?

230
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:46,884
Do I need to scan any QR Code?

231
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:49,253
Or is there some kind of contract to sign?

232
00:19:49,253 --> 00:19:51,555
Or should I ask my…

233
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:04,869
I've seen a Japanese manga before

234
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:07,971
and the robots in it are activated this way.

235
00:20:08,655 --> 00:20:14,647
♫ You cuddle by my side day and night ♫

236
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:18,081
♫ Wishing to nestle against your cheek ♫

237
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:21,970
♫ Looking at what you're gazing ♫

238
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:30,120
credit

239
00:20:30,127 --> 00:20:32,630
This doll is so realistic, isn't it?

240
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:36,167
Could it be a real person pretending
to be a doll as a prank?

241
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:38,068
That's a secret.

242
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:41,138
Don't touch it randomly.

243
00:20:41,138 --> 00:20:43,074
Hurry and take a picture.
It needs to be returned

244
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:46,975
The boss ordered it for a VIP client to try out
first thing tomorrow morning

245
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,549
It's fully equipped inside?

246
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:53,117
Of course.

247
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:55,986
But this No. 9 is the most unique one.

248
00:20:55,986 --> 00:20:59,354
Its functions and performance are all enhanced
in terms of emotions and thinking.

249
00:20:59,354 --> 00:21:02,725
If you disrespect it, it can get angry.

250
00:21:02,725 --> 00:21:04,616
Sounds incredible.

251
00:21:04,616 --> 00:21:07,063
When I take pictures, would it start moving and try

252
00:21:07,063 --> 00:21:09,567
to discuss the next moves with me?

253
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:10,968
That's impossible.

254
00:21:10,968 --> 00:21:14,503
The robot won't activate before a contract is signed

255
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,224
Hurry and take a picture.

256
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:27,016
♫ How many times has Earth's civilization
been destroyed and reborn ♫

257
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:36,994
Actually, you're not as annoying as the boss described.

258
00:21:36,994 --> 00:21:39,496
I don't like people coming
into my territory and making a mess.

259
00:21:40,898 --> 00:21:43,266
Accepting a master is a lifetime matter.

260
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:52,450
song title

261
00:21:55,416 --> 00:22:02,560
♫ Turns out that a long time is not forever ♫

262
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,152
♫ A hand held for so long ♫

263
00:22:05,152 --> 00:22:09,894
♫ Has become a hand waving goodbye ♫

264
00:22:09,894 --> 00:22:14,368
♫ The promises so bravely
voiced at the beginning ♫

265
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:18,456
♫ Have now lost the reason to be fulfilled ♫

266
00:22:18,456 --> 00:22:20,192
♫ A beginning with no end ♫

267
00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:24,512
♫ If we must pursue who's at fault ♫

268
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:30,231
♫ Blame it all on me ♫

269
00:22:30,231 --> 00:22:34,112
♫ Since words of love are spoken
without a second thought ♫

270
00:22:34,112 --> 00:22:38,172
♫ Why can't I let go with ease ♫

271
00:22:38,172 --> 00:22:45,504
[AntiReset]
♫ Some loss is called gaining ♫
