00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,341
Starting preparations this early?

15
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,343
I thought Wei Heng was coming tomorrow.

16
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,647
Some dishes are suitable
for stir-frying over high heat.

17
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,183
But dishes that take time to simmer slowly

18
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,751
will have a special flavor.

19
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,643
Is it broken?

20
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,580
Maybe it's just an operational error.

21
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,381
Things break.

22
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,383
Just like historical dynasties.

23
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,621
One fails, gets renewed,
and then declines again,

24
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,055
waiting for its new master.

25
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,158
Those who are reluctant to let go
are usually the old ministers.

26
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:23,129
They can't let go of the past,
being reluctant to lose.

27
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,667
So if you never had something,
you wouldn't be disappointed, right?

28
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,788
What's wrong?

29

31
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,730
That's so old-fashioned.

32
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,434
My database shows

33
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,936
that humans grew up playing this.

Okay?

00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,440
Why are you collecting these?

52
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,078
These are all proofs of existence.

53
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,346
I can't throw them away.

54
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:55,982
Even without these,

55
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,384
important memories will remain.

56
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,120
Just like history,

57
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,989
not all events are recorded,

58
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,425
but those who experienced them will remember.

59
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,195
But they might forget.

60
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:13,132
If one day all memories disappear,

61
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,701
at least these can prove that this moment

62
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,270
truly existed.

63
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,177
Humans themselves are products of history.

64
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,013
What their existence shows

65
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,282
is an ongoing process of becoming.

66
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,552

67
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,821

68
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,960

71
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:02,849
For us,

72
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,217
for me,

73
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,918
and for Master,

74
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,854
can we have something more?

75
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,331
Is this me?

00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,788
Boss, I'm reporting for duty.

79
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,124
Has my nephew contacted you
these past few days?

80
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,592
Nope.

81
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,581
Chu Yiping is a difficult guy.

82
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:54,333
So, there are no customer service complaints

83
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,616
or requests for returns?

Heng 9 is really something.

85
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,415
Chu Yiping doesn't get along with people.

86
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,286
Or maybe

87
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,988
it's no problem because he's not a person?

88
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,830

has come to see you.

How can it be so perfect?

93
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,690
I knew our company, Hengji

94
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,592
is truly incredible.

95
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,461
He's basically a real person.

96
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,229
Are you here for self-admiration?

97
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,332
I just came back from a business trip,

98
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,318
and I've come to see my nephew
with a broken hand.

99
00:10:02,318 --> 00:10:03,536
How are you?

100
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,871
Has Uncle's product taken good care of you?

101
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,173
I haven't seen you for a week,

102
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,207
and you've gained weight.

103
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,577
Less nonsense. Just eat and get going.

104
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,579
How heartless.

105
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:40,673
Heng 9,

106
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,876
these dishes look amazing,

107
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,278
but the taste might be a bit too bland.

108
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,383
You socialize a lot in your daily life.

109
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,285
Fasting might be better for your health.

110
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,454
According to my observation,

111
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:58,958
you have gained 2.7 kg since our last meeting.

112
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:03,029
And your figure is not as good as Mr. Zhu's.

113
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,334
Let me take a look.

114
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,243
Okay, I won't touch him.

115
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,879
The people in the lab don't allow it either.

116
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,282
But I'm the boss.

117
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,351
I have to try out the feel and texture.

118
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,852
How else will we mass-produce it later?

119
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,822
Mass-produce?

120
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,024
With such a high cost,
how can you mass-produce?

121
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,427
What's expensive is the core,
not the appearance.

122
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:38,497
You know our subsidiary, Hengchang Intimacy

123
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,700
is dedicated to developing
the demand for intimacy

124
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,635
between technology and humanity.

125
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,037
The anthropomorphic effect
is very good this time.

126
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,973
Combine this humanoid form
with just a little bit

127
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:50,743
of artificial intelligence reactions,

128
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,745
the effect will be awesome.

129
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,680
After the channels are opened,

130
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,783
'Making Hengchang part of your daily life'

131
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,885
won't be just a catchphrase.

132
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,887
Swindler.

133
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,991
However, although it's much more expensive
than the inflatable ones,

134
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:09,628
high quality aligns better with human needs.

135
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,064
It will surely become a bestseller.

136
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,066
You know, for the HengRen series,

137
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,901
every model has locked functions.

138
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,337
If you have special requirements…

139
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,108
Go change the sheets for me first.

140
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,909
I just did.

141
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,512
I want it cleaner.

142
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,514
Okay.

143
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,294
I don't have those needs.

144
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:45,831
We are both men.

145
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,700
No one's judging.

146
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,702
You've been single all along.

147
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,604
Uncle will grant you permission

148
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,273
so that he can take better care of you.

149
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,709
Although Heng 9's special function

150
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,211
is in the aspect of emotional care,

151
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,380
with this feature activated…

152
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,250
- You've eaten enough, right?
- Not yet.

153
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,752
I've just sat down.

154
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,423
By the way, the company has released
a new vacuuming robot.

155
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:12,825
I'll have it sent over to you tomorrow.

156
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,027
This one is not broken, so no need.

157
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,764
Is this HengRen series a trial version?

158
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,766
It's in the testing phase. What's up?

159
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,736
What to do if it breaks?

160
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:26,438
Is there a problem with Heng 9?

161
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,073
We'll repair it.

162
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,141
Like a computer.

163
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,209
As long as the core isn't damaged,

164
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,877
the exterior can be repaired.

165
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,479
Like I said before,

166
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,448
the company has mastered a new way
of creating anthropomorphic forms…

167
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,191
For humans,

168
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:48,384

00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,991
History becomes memory,

185
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:30,162
and influences choices,
both consciously and unconsciously.

186
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,500

You can take a shower today.

191
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,350
However, to avoid moving your joints

192
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,285
and causing unnecessary damage,

193
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,287
I will be helping you.

194
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,091
It's okay.

195
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,759
I haven't moved my left arm for so long.

196
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,994

Hurry up and get dressed.

226

Cold showers are beneficial for one's health.
