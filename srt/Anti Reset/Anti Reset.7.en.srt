My database shows

that alpacas and capybaras are both community-living animals.

63
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,375

You must stay healthy.

68
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,947
Companionship is a process of accommodating the other person's emotions,

69
00:06:57,947 --> 00:07:02,322
making them feel that they are not alone,

70
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:06,459
giving them the feeling of having someone stable and calm by their side.

71
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,874
Alpacas and capybaras both originate from South America.

72
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,143
They were originally half an earth away,

73

What a coincidence that you're swimming here, too.

128
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,686
Professor, has your shoulder healed?

129
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:11,123
You're in such good shape. Do you train regularly?

00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,224
Brother, we should go now.

131
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:15,294
Wait. I'm not done talking.

132
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,563
What are you doing?

133
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,732
Professor, you usually swim back and forth a dozen times.

134
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,233
Why are you leaving so early?

135
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,068
Let's go, Brother. I'm hungry.

136
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,570
I'm hungry, too.

137
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,338
Let's eat together.

138
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,274
You're dressed so beautifully today.

139
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,075
It's a pity not to swim more.

140
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,778
Yes, Miss He.

141
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:35,080
Since you've chosen to wear this to swim today,

142
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,683
you might as well skip eating. It'll make you fat.

143
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,385
You're the one who will get fat.

144
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,287
Let's go.

145
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,769
He Li was recommended by a professor.

146
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,971
She's quite capable at work.

147
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,574
But she prefers to use body language

148
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,876
to express a sort of appreciation.

149
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,580
The day I arrived,

150
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,116
was it she who came to look for you at home?

151
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:15,821
She even showed me many photos of you two having fun together.

152
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,656
"Professor Chu usually swims back and forth a dozen times.

153
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,792
Today, you're leaving so early."

154
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,728
For your next rehab, just ask her to accompany you.

155
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:26,999
After all, you only let me stay by the side.

156
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:30,968
No, really, there's nothing between us except work.

157
00:14:30,968 --> 00:14:34,437
When she came that time, it was to deliver some documents.

158
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,975
As for the photos, they should all be group photos or something.

159
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,448
When it comes to swimming, we don't meet that often.

160
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,184
And my lane is always very far from hers.

161
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,425
If you don't like her, just ignore her.

162
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,430
You can't expect me to act like what's on TV,

163
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,733
like I would fire her or anything.

164
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,402
She was recommended by a senior colleague.

165
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,537
I can't do that.

166
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,441
You can't expect me to act like they do in the movies.

167
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,543
I'm not.

168
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,449
I'm certainly not that type of person.

169
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,886
Nor am I that kind of artificial intelligence.

170
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,523
Don't believe those TV shows and movies.

171
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,625
They've all taught you bad habits.

172
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,463
Of course, I know you're not that kind of person.

173
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:38,368
Actually, when you stepped in to bail me out,

174
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:40,205
I was so happy.

175
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,375
After all, ever since I was young,

176
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,011
I've always dealt with everything by myself.

177
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,065
I'm sorry.

178
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,134
I shouldn't have treated Miss He that way.
