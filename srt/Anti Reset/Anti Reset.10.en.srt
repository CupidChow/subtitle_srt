00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,669
I will no longer be me.

when they can't be repaired.

116
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,147
So I made a documentary

118
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,786
As for this time,

119
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:38,958
think of it as a movie we watched together.

120
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,960
It was beautiful.

121
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,264
But after watching it, when it's over,

122
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,600
we should return to the daily routine.

124
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:04,083
is the place where we first met.

125
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,419
I still remember

126
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,687
that back then, you just wouldn't believe

127
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,689
that I am an artificial intelligence.

128
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,492
You had to touch me all over.

129
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,528
I think you just wanted
to take advantage of me.

130
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,297
This is where I first

131
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,299
cooked a meal for you.

132
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,136
Remember to eat less instant noodles
and energy bars in the future.

133
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,205
Try more of the original flavors of food.

134
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,641
It's healthier that way.

135
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,814
Actually, I still don't quite understand

136
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:35,915
why you had to drive me

137
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,017
out of the bathroom

138
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,920
when your arm was injured.

139
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,856
You must promise me

140
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,927
that in the future, you will let
someone accompany you

141
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,263
and let others help you,

143
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,735
This is where we first

144
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,737
went shopping together at the supermarket.

145
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,306
Here

146
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,576
is where I truly sat in a classroom
for the first time and took a lesson.

147
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,679
The Professor Chu I know

148
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,882
is warm, sincere,

149
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,752
and not scary at all.

150
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,857
Here

151
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:21,060
is when I first touched an animal.

Here

155
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:33,506
is how I learned what a kiss means.

156
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:46,018
It turns out that even if it's dark, smelly,
and filled with mosquitoes,

157
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,487
as long as lovers can stay together,

158
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,690
it's called romance.

159
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,293
I'm sorry

160
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,895
for making you worry.

161
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:02,001
I believe the happiness we experienced

162
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,170
at the highest point in the city

163

and the scenery we have seen together

166
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,584
are all truly special.

167
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,857
But I'm sorry.

that I will only be your Heng 9.

173
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,721
But you have to promise me

174

that you must find someone
who takes care of you

175
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,059

How can you be so heartless?

193
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:28,367
How could you erase everything completely,

194
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,135
leaving nothing for me?

205
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:04,490
and at the same time, fifty million
new ones are born.

206
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,628
If every seven years,
all cells are replaced for once,

207
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,766
would people's longing also be replaced
by new cells

208
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,868
within seven years?

209
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,507

[Seven Years Later]

214
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:39,885
Hello?

215
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,221
You aren't spending your birthday alone, right?

216
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,990
The department's office had
a birthday celebration in the afternoon.

217
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,660
You must have felt awkward.

218
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,598
I have to go now.

219
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,366
I've forgotten what I was supposed to do.

220
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,003
Cooking for yourself on your birthday?

221
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:59,872
Come on, Uncle will treat you to a meal.

222
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,473
Let's head out now.

223
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,312
Hello?

224
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,047
Are you listening?

225
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,453
He said if I couldn't find someone
to take care of me,

226
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,522
at least I should take good care of myself.

227
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,992
Cooking home is healthier.

228
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,460
I'll pass on the offer.

229
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,662
Okay.

230
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,932
I will leave you alone then.

231
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:27,966
Bye.

232
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,323
Silly child.

233
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,726
It's been so long.

234
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,529
What are you still holding on to?

235
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,936
Turns out nothing has been let go.

236
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,571
Nothing has been forgotten.

237
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,517
I've gotten old too,

238
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,387
starting to get sentimental
over these little things.

239
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,205
Sorry.

240
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,875
Human beings are just that limited.

241
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,380
Even if I go back to that time,

242
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,916
I would still make the same decision.

243
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,723
But because there are infinite possibilities,

244
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,628

247
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,884
I made the dishes he once made.

Mr. Chu Yiping's signature required.

249
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:03,722
Hello.

250
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,724
This is a delivery
from Hengji Intelligent Development.

251
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,559
Is Mr. Chu at home?

252
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,800
Although I am the most
advanced artificial intelligence,

253
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,301
with this way you're hugging me,

254
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,537
it's hard to tell whether you'll break me.

255
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:22,374
You…

256
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,608
What's wrong with me?

257
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:24,743
Am I cuter?

258
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,345
Or more charming?

259
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,714
You hugged me without even looking.

260
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,482
Aren't you afraid of hugging the wrong person?

261
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:31,783
Or no matter who it is,

262
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,318
you would hug them this way?

263
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,824
You don't have someone new, do you?

264
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,726
Is it not convenient for me to come in?

265
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,829
This isn't a dream, is it?

266
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:48,533
Master.

267
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,202
Please continue to guide me.

268
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:21,166
Your guidance seems a bit intense.

269
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:24,836
Only this way,

270
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:26,838
can I be sure you really came back.

272
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,566
I give my child to you.

273
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:58,203
Every five years, I'll provide an
advanced beauty treatment.

274
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,971
The cost is on me.

Good morning.

00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,760
Why not on the lips?

286
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,033
You should brush your teeth first.

287
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,512
You were eager.

You must not be impatient.

You'd better not find me boring.

00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,060
I certainly won't.
