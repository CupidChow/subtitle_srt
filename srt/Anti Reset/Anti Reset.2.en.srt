You're not thinking of buying it, are you?

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,809
If it's just the individual figure, it would be several million.

Let me help you.

33
00:03:04,232 --> 00:03:06,451
Hello, Professor. I'm near your house.

34
00:03:06,451 --> 00:03:09,122
I've prepared some materials
and breakfast for you.

35
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,757
You probably haven't eaten yet.

00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,358
I have eaten.

37
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,631
Professor, is there someone in your house?

38
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:18,832
It's not someone.

39
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,700
Just let me know when you arrive.

40
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,835
Okay, bye.

41
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,840
There's a robovac here. You can use it.

42
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,944
Robovac.

43
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,713
I know other companies
have also developed robots.

44
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:37,648
But no matter what, they're not as excellent
as Hengji Intelligence.

45
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,055
You just have to press this button, and then adjust the mode.

46
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,923
I know how to use it.

47
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,958
But, Master, this isn't a robot.

48
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,595
It's just a vacuum cleaner.

49
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,463
It can come out to patrol every day,

50
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,799
but if you want to keep your house clean,

51
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,167
you still need me to do a thorough cleaning.

52
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:09,549
Actually, you're not
as annoying as the boss described.

53
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,185
Boss?

54
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,853
Is it Wei Heng?

55
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,989
Did he say I was annoying?

56
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,391
Shouldn't you be calling him Uncle?

57
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,328
What exactly has he been teaching you?

58
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,064
The boss didn't teach me personally,

59
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:28,331
but he asked the secretary to input a lot of useful information for me.

60
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:30,337
Useful?

61
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:34,338
He didn't ask you to take good care of me or something, did he?

62
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,378
So in response to cleaning and care needs,

63
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,080
do you authorize me to come and go as I please?

64
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:49,520
Professor, with your injured handshall I come over?

65
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,760

usual look at school.

The injured arm and his steel-hard self

73
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:39,899
adds a bit of vulnerability to him.

00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,486
Are you happy to be with me?

182
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,759
Does it matter who you are assigned to?

183
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,761
After all, it's just a trial.

184
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,732
I'll prepare a guest room for you.

185
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,367
But you'll have to tidy it up yourself.

186
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,204
I am fine here.

187
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,540
The greatest principle of being
an artificial intelligence

188
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,909
is not to interfere with the master's life.

189
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:48,180
Everything in this world
deserves a place to live.

190
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,449
Even a sweeping robot has its own home.

191
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,117
So why should you stay here?

192
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,119
Furthermore,

193
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,421
don't call me Master anymore.

194
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,989
And stop addressing me so formally.

195
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,791
Since you've come here,

196
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,793
treat this place like your own home,

197
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,530
at least until you leave.

198
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,222
Chu Yiping.

199
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,224
Is this what you normally eat?

200
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,659
It's convenient.

201
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,695
I'll find someone to cook and clean for you.

202
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,729
No need.

203
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,865
I don't like people coming
into my space and making a mess

204
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,871
Dinner will be ready in ten minutes.

205
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,270
I'll do it.

206
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,306
Head.

207
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,530
We don't wear this.

208
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,699
Therefore, I don't have
this information in my database.

209
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,234
I'll know it by next time.

210
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:23,869
It's okay

211
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,170
Once you learn, you'll know how to do it.

212
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:30,470
♫ Fortunately, you don't know ♫

213
00:18:30,481 --> 00:18:35,306
♫ Just like the bell that jingles
as you lift your head ♫

214
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,728
♫ My intense longing burns ♫

215
00:18:37,728 --> 00:18:40,183
♫ Tears trace the corners of my eyes ♫

216
00:18:40,183 --> 00:18:43,936
♫ Like an overheated tsunami ♫

217
00:18:43,936 --> 00:18:48,576
♫ Fortunately, you don't know ♫

218
00:18:48,576 --> 00:18:53,986
♫ I hide in yesterday
where there's no fuss or noise ♫

219
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:58,766
♫ I don't rehearse your silly laughter ♫

220
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:02,969
♫ Just wondering what your hugs
would feel like ♫

221
00:19:02,969 --> 00:19:08,247
♫ Keep the heartbeat
of your love for me in mind ♫

222
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,748
Does it not suit your taste?

223
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,803
It's not that.

224
00:19:13,803 --> 00:19:16,588
Looking at the style,

225
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:18,590
I thought it would taste better.

226
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,028
You must eat out often,

227
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,330
with high oil and salt content,
and your flavor preference is strong.

228
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,238
This is a special diet arranged

229
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:34,840
for your recovery period.

230
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,409
It's balanced and healthy.

231
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:40,012
As for the taste,

232
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,114
that might be a matter of personal opinion.

233
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:46,718
I am the best at cooking in the HengRen series.

234
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:13,111
Half of a person is a companion.

235
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,380
History tells us

236
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,916
when you allow someone into your life,

237
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,985
space is shared,

238
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,187
behaviors are validated,

239
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,690
and self-consciousness is divided.

240
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,274
So I really can't take a shower?

241
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,210
Sponge bathing in the first week is recommended

242
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,713
to avoid hot water causing
your blood to circulate too quickly.

243
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,456
Your mobility is currently still limited.

244
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,758
The risk of accidents
in the bathroom is quite high.

245
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,560
I must accompany you throughout.

246
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,161
Otherwise, if there's an issue,

247
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,563
I won't be able to assist you immediately.

248
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,231
That would be my negligence.

249
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,040
Master,

250
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,842
let me pick that up for you.

251
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,898
Master,

252
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,734
you may sit down now.

253
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,169
I will help you with your bath.

254
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,787
How did Hengji make you all so lifelike?

255
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,056
What do the other eight look like?

256
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:39,524
Do they look like you too?

257
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:41,760
Not the same.

258
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,030
I know they're not the same.

259
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,198
What I mean is, are they…

260
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,799
I mean,

261
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,001
I am different from them.

262
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,276
That very moment,

263
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,344
I understood.

264
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:01,747
This is not a robot.

265
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,615
It's just a vacuum cleaner.

266
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:07,119
I am the best at cooking in the HengRen series.

267
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:12,090
Everything longs for recognition,

268
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,994
and if it exists, it does not
wish to be erased.

269
00:23:23,872 --> 00:23:28,192
♫ In the fifth solar system ♫

270
00:23:28,192 --> 00:23:32,512
♫ I pay with waiting ♫

271
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,884
After too many disappointments,

272
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:39,951
it's easy for one

273
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:42,254
to stop expecting
the unexpected from the world.

274
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:45,843
♫ Rescuing the soul ♫

275
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:49,392

♫ I want to wake up for you ♫

As Martin Luther King once said,

279
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:13,351
we must accept finite disappointment,

280
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,688
but never lose infinite hope.

281
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:19,858
What will this relationship

282
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,860
turn out to be?

283
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:27,808

Do you take cold showers? Why?

309

Every model has locked functions.

310
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,704
If you have special requirements…

311
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,238
You are my first owner.

312
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:49,474
Taking good care of you is my duty.

313
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,409
