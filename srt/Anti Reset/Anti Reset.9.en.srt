This painting reminds us

31
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,663
of France in the 16th century.

32
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,231
At that time, a certain culture

33
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,699
known as the salon culture was very popular.

34
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,634
Hearing the word 'salon', you might

35
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,604
think of a place for manicures
or beauty treatments.

36
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,673
Women at that time didn't have jobs,

37
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,975
were afraid of being bored at home,
and wanted to pursue knowledge.

38

00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,579

00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,381

184
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:17,088
♫ On the contrary ♫

185
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:21,632
♫ Our ending has nothing to do
with not loving anymore ♫

186
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,258
The reason that made me
rush back recklessly that day

187
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,824
♫ The story may take a new twist ♫

♫ Struggling, making the same mistakes again ♫

189
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:40,472
How boring and how much of a failure I am

190
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,241
to make Heng 9 want to leave?

192
00:15:47,768 --> 00:15:51,810

♫ Some loss is called gaining ♫

201
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,927
I'll make something for you one last time,

202
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,631
although it will be gone once eaten.

203
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,801
But that's okay too.

204
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,416
It will be digested into nutrients

205
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,941
and then forgotten, completely and utterly.

206
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,406
I will disappear entirely from your life

207
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,009
to ensure your future

208
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,312
wouldn't be disturbed by me.

209
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,164
You're back.

210
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,600
This is the contract.

211
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,572
Actually, you were tricked
by me in the beginning.

212
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,141
We never signed a contract.

213
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,845
From the start, I never wanted

214
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,481
to treat myself like a commodity
and sign a contract,

215
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,718
but rather, someone applying
for a job here with you.

216
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,256
However, being too greedy

217
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,258
created many bugs.

218
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,795
My actions overstepped the bounds

219
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,164
and made our relationship confusing,

220
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,435
leading to the situation now.

221
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,141
There's no confusion.

222
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,275
I like you.

223
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,077
You want to stay by my side.

224
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,445
Isn't that the case?

225
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,082
You know it, don't you?

226
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:15,220
All this might well be illusions
caused by the settings.

227
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:19,324
During the last maintenance,

228
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,528
it was discovered that my
emotional cognition core system

229
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,997
had some problems

230
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,900
that will inevitably cause you
more trouble in the future.

231
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,670
So this trial period

232
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:34,706
should be suspended for now.

233
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,643
No.

234
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:39,845
If you refuse,

235
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,314
the company will have to stop

236
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,082
producing products like us.

237
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,250
In the future, many people

238
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,252
will not be able to enjoy such services.

239
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,729
If one day,

240
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,199
you are RESET to the next owner,

241
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,700
will you also

242
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,869
wait there for him to return like this?

243
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,271
You will forget everything we've been through.

244
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,141
But I will remember everything.

245
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,011
I'm sorry.

246
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,447
It's the end now.

247
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:17,316
But I'm still so willful.

248
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,554
You are running away

249
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,789
without taking good care of me.

250
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,991
This is very irresponsible.

251
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,495
But I'm about to break down.

252
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:34,800
I don't want you to see me broken.

253
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,668
I'm sorry.

254
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,837
It must be my fault.

255
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,772
I've never loved anyone.

256
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,375
So I don't know how to love properly.

257
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,576
It's my fault.

258
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,878
I caused this for you.

259
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,480
It's not your fault.

260
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:53,118
You gave me a lot, a lot of love.

261
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,555
I have to thank you

262
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,891
for giving me the experience of being human.

263
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,295
This is the first time.

264
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,297
and also the last time.

265
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,303
Even if I am RESET,

266
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,839
this is still an irreplaceable memory.

267
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,911
Please remember me.

268
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,181
But you must not miss me too much.

269
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:28,520
After all, this memory is really interesting.

270
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,664
Please don't leave, okay?

271
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,100
I'm begging you.

272
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,070
Please don't go.

273
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,405
Okay?

274
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,176
Don't leave me.

275
00:22:05,234 --> 00:22:08,416
[I give you the answer with a whole memory.]

276
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,777
Are you a robot?

277
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,178
Does the data need to be updated regularly?

278
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:01,980
Do you feel hot and cold?

279
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,982
Wait for me.

280
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,317
I'll finish quickly.

281
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:06,518
Then let's go home.

282
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:08,520
There will be plenty of time.

283
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,788
Let's continue tomorrow.

284
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:10,822
Okay?

285
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,926
To my dearest master,

286
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,462
I am broken.

287
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,234
After the RESET, I will no longer be me.

288
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,337
As for this period of time,

289
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,839
think of it as a movie we watched together.

290
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,642
It was beautiful.

291
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:36,548
But after watching it, we should return
to the daily routine.

292
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:38,683
You can do it.

293
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,752
I believe in you.

294
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,522
Promise me, you must find someone
who takes care of you.

295
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,323
Don't grow old alone.

296
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,859
Just this once, will you return Heng 9 to me?

297
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:48,860
I'm sorry.

298
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,396
I can't grow old with you.
