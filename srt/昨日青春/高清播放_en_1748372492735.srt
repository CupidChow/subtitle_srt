I'm going to eat something.

00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,140
Is it a set this time?

00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,140
It's nice.

152
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,140
I've been longing for it since I was young.

00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,140
I'm sorry.

154
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,140

Hurry up.

157
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,140
I forgot something.

158
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,140
It's a souvenir from the mayor.

159
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,140

I forgot.

165
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,140
Why is Kochi still here?

166
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,140
I'll stop today.

167
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,140
Is it possible...

168
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,140
Oh, no.

169
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,140
Did he just drop through?

170
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,140
It's not possible.

171
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,140
This way.

172
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,140
The car's here.

173
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,140
Here's your luggage.

174
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,140

Oh, it's coming!

Yes, you should.

191
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,140
Why are you playing so little?

192
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,140
I'm not playing.

193
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,140
I'm not playing!

194
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,140

00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,140
Let's go to Kochi.

204
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,140
Let's go to Kochi.

205
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,140
You're so lame.

206
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,140
I want to be like that old man.

207
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,140
That's too much.

208
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,140
It's not funny.

209
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,140
Do you think so?

210
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,140
I want to see it.

211
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,140
I want to see it, but...

212
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,140
Rock-paper-scissors.

213
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,140
Rock-paper-scissors!

214
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,140
Let's go!

215
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,140
Let's go!

216
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,140
Let's go!

217
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,140
Let's go!

218
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,140
Let's go!

219
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,140
Let's go!

220
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,140
Let's go!

221
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,140
Let's go!

222
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,140
I'm not playing.

223
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,140
I played, but he's not playing.

224
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,140
Let's go!

225
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,140
I'm not playing.

226
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,140
I'm not playing.

227
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,140
You're not gonna be play, right?

228
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,140
Of course not.

229
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,140
I can't go inside and play You can't go inside and play

230
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,140
That farmers can't do.

231
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,140
You can just play more Let's go!

232
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,440
Is this Kochi?

233
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,140
Shoot

234
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,140
What the hell are you doing?

235
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,140
Put your nose between his mouth.

236
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,140
I'm wrong, you need bounce back!

237
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,140
I can't.

238
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,140
You're over there.

239
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,140
Go home.

240
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,140
I can't.

241
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,140
Go home.

242
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,140
Bye.

243
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,140
I love you.

244
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,140
I love you, Ko-chan.

245
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,140
I know. Be quiet.

246
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,140
I can't hear you.

247
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,140
I know. I love you.

248
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,140
See you tomorrow.

249
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,140
See you today.

250
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,140
Bye.

251
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:19,140
The Eid al-Fitr prayer of Geladar

252
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,140
It's the April Fools Sale again.

253
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,140
Kill me.

254
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,140
I don't want to work.

255
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,140
Koji, what about your graduation?

256
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,140
I'll be there soon.

257
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,140
I'll work when I graduate.

258
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,140
I'll be a construction worker when I graduate.

259
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,140
No, no. You're going to university.

260
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,140
What about that?

261
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,140
Did you get your scholarship?

262
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,140
Not yet.

263
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,140
But I have a good feeling about it.

264
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,140
I'm thankful that I have a job every day.

265
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,140
I'm going to work when I graduate.

266
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,140
Thank you.

267
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,140
Thank you.

268
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,140
See you.

269
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,140
I'm lost.

270
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,140
I'm going to work.

271
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,140
I'm going to work.

272
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,140
Thank you.

273
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,140
I'm going to work.

274
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,140
Thank you.

275
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,140
The police are coming.

276
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,140
Shall we go to the main building?

277
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,140
Or shall we go to the police car?

278
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,140
Please come in.

279
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,140
It's 0.

280
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,140
It's the express train.

281
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,140
Thank you.

282
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,140
Wait.

283
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,140
Where are you going?

284
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,140
Home.

285
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,140
Where are you going?

286
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,140
Please come in.

287
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,140
Please come in.

288
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,140

Please enter the home area.

298
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,140
Who will save.

299
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,140
Who will save.

300
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,140
Who will save.

301
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,140
Is that all right?

302
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,140
That was...

303
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,140
What?

304
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,140
You don't have a height limit?

305
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,140
Yeah, can I try again?

306
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,140
A height limit.

307
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,140
No!

308
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,140
It's different!

309
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,140
Here, here, here!

310
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,140
Hey!

311
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,140
Hey!

312
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,140
Hey!

313
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,140
If I were to be the only one who got hurt, you'd be in trouble!

314
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:13,140
The police are just a weapon that protects the wealth of the country and the poor!

315
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:29,140
Hey, what's your next move?

316
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,140
Hey, stand up!

317
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:39,140
Yuta, you're such a bad kid.

318
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:44,140
I'm sorry, but the principal said I should be the only one who got hurt.

319
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:49,140
I'm sorry, but the principal said I should be the only one who got hurt.

320
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:58,140
I'm sorry, but the principal always cares about cars so I'm lonely.

321
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:03,140
I'm sorry, but I'm a cleaner too.

322
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,140
Is that so?

323
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:14,140
Yuta always plays with the coat, so I can only play with Z.

324
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:20,140
I wish I could have been lonely for three years.

325
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,140
I'm sorry I didn't notice.

326
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,140
Yuta, you've lost some weight.

327
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:34,140
I'm on a digital detox, so I left my phone at home.

328
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,140
I can't provide you with the information on the night of the incident.

329
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:46,140
I believe that you should focus on teaching the teachers instead of getting information from your phone.

330
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,140
Next...

331
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:55,140
You left your phone at home just like him.

332
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,140
Where were you last night?

333
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,140
Answer my question.

334
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,140
I'll give you another chance.

335
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,140
Don't listen to him.

336
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,140
You guys are the ones who decide.

337
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,140
Why do you decide when you have evidence?

338
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,140
Have you ever heard of pattern recognition?

339
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,140
You've been a principal for so long.

340
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,140
You don't know much about AI, but you know most of the patterns.

341
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,140
Especially the ones you've grown up with.

342
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,140
What do you mean?

343
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,140
You're different from the average Japanese.

344
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,140
What do you mean?

345
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,140
You're good at collecting money and showing off your sport.

346
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,140
What are you doing?

347
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,140
Enough!

348
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,140
So...

349
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:06,140
You're going to pay for the construction of this building?

350
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,140
That's impossible.

351
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,140
You're getting paid for your school.

352
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,140
Well, I guess so.

353
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:26,140
All of the 428 high schools in Tokyo are asking for the same money.

354
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,140
You can't just sit around and do nothing.

355
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,140
So...

356
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:41,140
If you're confident, you want to be the underling of this building?

357
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:49,140
All of this is for your own safety.

358
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,140
That's right.

359
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,140
I'm going to go.

360
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,140
If you keep that attitude,

361
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:22,140
you won't be able to get the money back.

362
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,140
I'm going to make sure you don't see this.

363
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,140
Hey, your phone.

364
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,140
You're so stubborn.

365
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,140
You're going to get caught.

366
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,140
You heard me.

367
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,140
I know, but you're always like this.

368
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,140
You'll do well.

369
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,140
I'm sorry.

370
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,140
Are you okay?

371
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,140
Here.

372
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,140
Oh.

373
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,140
Thanks.

374
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,140
That principal is the worst.

375
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,140
He's so racist.

376
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,140
Yeah.

377
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,140
Why is he always like that?

378
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,140
He's so cool.

379
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,140
He's so cool.

380
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,140
No.

381
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,140
He's normal.

382
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,140
That car is so cool.

383
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,140
It's so cool.

384
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,140
Who did this?

385
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,140
I wanted to think of it.

386
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,140
Let's go.

387
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,140
Bye.

388
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,140
Your phone.

389
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,140
So...

390
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,140
You can get it back.

391
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,140
No.

392
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,140
I'm not angry.

393
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,140
It's an earthquake.

394
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,140
It's an earthquake.

395
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,140

It's an earthquake.

397
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,140
It's an earthquake.

398
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,140
It's close.

399
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,140
It's close.

400
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,140
Give it to me.

401
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,140

Something amazing happened.

00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,360
Oh no.

I'm sorry.

453
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,360
For safety, we must be alert.

454
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,360
We're against the rules.

455
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,360
It's delicious.

456
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,360
If I had a right to vote...

457
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,360
I would have voted for you.

458
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,360

00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,360
Is it hot?

462
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,360
No, it's okay.

463
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,360
Well, I'm sorry.

464
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,360
It's okay.

465
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,360
It's okay.

466
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,360
Sit down.

467
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,360
There's something I have to explain to you.

468
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,360
What's that?

469
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,360

What?

477
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,360
There was no problem before.

478
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,360
It's cute.

479
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,360

It's cute.

484
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,360
It's cute.

485
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,360
Ata-chan, Ata-chan.

486
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,360
It's dangerous.

487
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,360
He went to the police station.

488
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,360
What?

489
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,360
What?

490
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,360
What?

491
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
What?

492
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,360
What?

493
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,360
What?

494
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
What?

495
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,360
Wait a minute.

Wait a minute.

497
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,360
Wait a minute.

498
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,360
Wait a minute.

499
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,360
I didn't hear it.

500
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,360
Wait a minute.

501
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,360
It's cute.

502
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,360
It's cute.

503
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,360
It's cute.

504
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,360
A lot.

505
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,360

More!

509
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,360
A lot.

510
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,360
I said more!

511
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,360
More!

512
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,360
More!

513
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
Let's go!

514
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,360
Go!

515
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,360

I'm not sure.

527
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,360
I'm not sure.

528
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,360
I'm not sure.

529
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,360

542
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,360

00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,360
I'm not sure.

548
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,940
It seems he mentioned it before.

549
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,940
Our generation lots to choose from.

550
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,820
It made me really scared.

551
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,600
Oh no.

552
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,860
I'm the one who heaven's here with everything!

553
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,260
But it pisses me off every time

554
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
someone does do things like this.

555
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,320
There you go…

556
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,740
No one really cares about where you come from.

557
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,940
That's the way it is.

558
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,940
I can understandoya.

559
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:41,320
You need to事 appearance management and summarize evidence 🳨

560
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,080
That's crap.

561
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:50,360
But you know, you've given up on us since the beginning.

562
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,360
You've given up on our generation.

563
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,360
Kou, you're right.

564
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,360
You need to have hope for your generation.

565
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,360
This is the restaurant.

566
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,360
Is that a new one?

567
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,360
Yes.

568
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,360
This one?

569
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,360
What's that?

570
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,360
I don't know.

571
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,360
Yuta, where are you going?

572
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,360
Yuta's not in the mood.

573
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,360
He's not in the mood.

574
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:12,360
Yuta and Kou will become famous musicians and go abroad.

575
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,360
I'm not in the mood.

576
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,360
I'm a fool.

577
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,360
You'll find something.

578
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,360
I'm fine.

579
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,360
I'm smart and I can speak Chinese.

580
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,360
You can go anywhere.

581
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,360
I can't speak Chinese.

582
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,360
You can't go anywhere.

583
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,360
What?

584
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,360
He hasn't left yet?

585
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,360
Kou told me.

586
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,360
That's bad.

587
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,360
You need to tell Yuta.

588
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,360
Have you ever talked to Yuta like that?

589
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,360
Yuta.

590
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,360
Yuta.

591
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,360
I need to talk to you.

592
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,360
What?

593
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:13,360
I'm going to America after graduation.

594
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,360
America?

595
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,360
Why?

596
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,360
I'm going to the university in America.

597
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,360
Really?

598
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,360
Congratulations.

599
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,360
I was worried about you.

600
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,360
Why are you worried?

601
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,360
You're enjoying it.

602
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:38,360
Yuta said we were together even after graduation.

603
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,360
I couldn't say it.

604
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,360
But I'm glad Yuta is okay.

605
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,360
Are you okay?

606
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,360
I should have said it sooner.

607
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,360
I'm fine.

608
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,360
Hey!

609
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,360
Come here!

610
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,360
Yuki was here.

611
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,360
It was really bad.

612
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,360
Yuta.

613
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,360
There was a booth here.

614
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,360
Function Man was here.

615
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,360
The lights were here.

616
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,360
I want to see where my father grew up.

617
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,360
There are relatives here.

618
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,360
It hasn't changed for a while.

619
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,360
But one saloon is...

620
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,360
Detroit.

621
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,360
The holy place of techno.

622
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:08,360
Forced labor from an honest person.

623
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:18,360
Staff drink water while waiting for work to start.

624
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,360
What about vice?

625
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:28,360
Forced labor for white beginners propagates revenge.

626
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,160
Så

627
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,360
is

628
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,760
this

629
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,760
is

630
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,660
So

631
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,880
show me do

632
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,180
so

633
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,180
Garcia.

634
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:24,740
organisers

635
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,180
Yes.

636
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:33,180
Don't lie, believe it.

637
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:37,180
Don't lie, believe it.

638
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:44,180
The greatest thing in this world is the computer.

639
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,180
Can we change society with demo?

640
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,180
I don't know.

641
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:04,180
But if we make it so big that it stops the economy,

642
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:07,180
we can compromise the power.

643
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,180
That's the idea.

644
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,180
What do you think?

645
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,180
It's a demo.

646
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,180
What's inside?

647
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,180
There's a demo next week.

648
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,180
Shall we go?

649
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,180
Fumi, let's go.

650
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,180
Hey, Fumi.

651
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,180
What?

652
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,180
You're going to the demo next week, right?

653
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:32,180
I'm going.

654
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,180
I want to go.

655
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,180
Okay.

656
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,180
It's okay. We're still young.

657
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,180
We can remember Chinese right away.

658
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:47,180
My Chinese is the same as kindergarten.

659
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:50,180
Of course, I can't speak Taiwanese.

660
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,180
When I talk to my father,

661
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,180
my mother translates everything.

662
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,180
I'm really good at it.

663
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:21,180
You can understand what's important without words.

664
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,180
Right, Wata?

665
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,180
What?

666
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,180
Yeah, that's right.

667
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,180
I'm fine.

668
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,180
I'm smart.

669
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,180
I'm fine.

670
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,180
Okay.

671
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,180
What's going on?

672
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,180
What's going on?

673
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,180
What's going on?

674
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,180
What's going on?

675
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:16,180
Good morning.

676
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,180
Good morning.

677
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,180
This is what I told you yesterday.

678
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:32,180
You read books with paper?

679
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,180
I like books with paper.

680
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,180
I see.

681
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,180
I'm sorry.

682
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,180
I'm sorry.

683
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,180
I like books with paper.

684
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,180
Thank you.

685
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,180
I'll see you tonight.

686
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,180
What's wrong?

687
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,180
I can't help it.

688
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:46,180
If the old economy is in trouble,

689
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,180
the fire department will be over.

690
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,180
You guys are also releasing fire-fighting machines.

691
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,180
I'm worried about the beer.

692
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,180
Don't give up.

693
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,180
Even if you didn't get a job or a university,

694
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,180
be grateful to the principal.

695
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,180
I'm sorry.

696
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,180
Thank you.

697
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:19,180
You can't use that room anymore.

698
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:21,180
If you want to use the equipment,

699
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,180
you have to apply for it by the day before tomorrow.

700
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,180
I'll put the documents here.

701
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,180
Use it with the equipment you want to use.

702
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,180
It's time for school.

703
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,180
Tomino.

704
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,180
Tomino.

705
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:43,180
You were on a 10-point discount.

706
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:47,180
I'm going to clean up this week's office.

707
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,180
Hey.

708
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:02,180
What?

709
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,180
What?

710
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,180
What's the danger of fires?

711
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:30,180
I've never been worried about it.

712
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,180
It's weird.

713
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,180
But I can't help it.

714
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,180
What can't you do?

715
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,180
We're here.

716
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,180
Everyone says that.

717
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,180
But it's a school.

718
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,180
It's a secret.

719
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:55,180
I'm sure you're just trying to get a reason to fire me.

720
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:59,180
Seriously, the principal of the school.

721
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,180
Bring all the documents.

722
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,180
How?

723
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:07,180
We can steal them.

724
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,180
Good idea.

725
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,180
Let's steal them.

726
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:13,180
We don't need to be scared by the surveillance system.

727
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,180
But the cameras...

728
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,180
It's weird to be under surveillance.

729
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,180
We can steal 5 points.

730
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:21,180
But I'm on a 10-point discount.

731
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,180
Why are you giving up so early?

732
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,180
You're following the rules.

733
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,180
I'm sorry.

734
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,180
Did you say you were going to be evacuated today?

735
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,180
No, I didn't.

736
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,180
What about this?

737
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,180
Everyone, let's go out immediately.

738
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,180
Okay.

739
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,180
They're not evacuating.

740
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,180
They're evacuating.

741
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,180
It's okay.

742
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,180
Left, left.

743
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:02,180
I'm not going to let you go.

744
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,180
What are you doing?

745
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34,180
Hurry up.

746
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,180
I'm going home too.

747
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,180
Why?

748
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,180
Where are you going?

749
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,180
I'm going to the bathroom.

750
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,180
I'm going to see my girlfriend.

751
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,180
What?

752
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,180
You?

753
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,180
That girl?

754
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,180
Really?

755
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,180
Everyone asked.

756
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:06,180
I got a girlfriend.

757
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,180
Congratulations.

758
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:10,180
Why are you telling me so early?

759
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:33,180
Just a little music and you can't think?

760
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:36,180
Do you know what's going on in the world?

761
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:39,180
What?

762
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,180
What's wrong with you?

763
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:43,180
Come on, do it.

764
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:49,180
I'm going to die without noticing while everyone is playing.

765
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,180
If you die anyway, you'll die with joy.

766
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:54,180
They die without noticing while playing.

767
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:57,180
What do you mean they die? They die for fun.

768
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,180
Oh, Kou.

769
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:10,180
Look at this.

770
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:12,180
Gold leaf.

771
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:15,180
It's rare to see it at convenience stores.

772
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:18,180
Compared to Kou's mother, it's not that much.

773
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:21,180
It's like he's not thinking about anything.

774
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:24,180
I can't do it either.

775
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:33,180
I understand what Kou is saying.

776
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:38,180
But I can't stay with him for a while.

777
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:53,180
She doesn't really need help.

778
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:16,440
The training hop-up8, simulation reporter

779
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:21,180
Second question

780
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,700
Folk music

781
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:24,960
Well hello

782
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,440
So slow

783
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,800
Do you want me to hire someone who's late?

784
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,240
I'm on the phone, sitting together

785
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,820
annon

786
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,040
You're DJing, so rare

787
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,240
You like old music?

788
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:42,880
Yes

789
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,720
I haven't heard any new tracks

790
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,520
There's nothing new.

791
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,520
So I can only discover the old masterpieces.

792
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,520
Don't say such a sad thing.

793
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,920
I can come here every day.

794
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,720
Maybe.

795
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,720
You can say yes when you do that.

796
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:21,920
Yes.

797
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,320
Yusuke, I'm going to work on the weekend.

798
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,320
Thank you.

799
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,720
I'm going to work on the weekend.

800
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,920
I'm going to work on the weekend.

801
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,120
I'm going to work on the weekend.

802
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,320
I'm going to work on the weekend.

803
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,520
I'm going to work on the weekend.

804
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,720
I'm going to work on the weekend.

805
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,920
I'm going to work on the weekend.

806
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,120
I'm going to work on the weekend.

807
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,320
I'm going to work on the weekend.

808
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,520
I'm going to work on the weekend.

809
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,720
I'm going to work on the weekend.

810
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,920
I'm going to work on the weekend.

811
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,120
I'm going to work on the weekend.

812
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,120
I'm going to work on the weekend.

813
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,320
I'm going to work on the weekend.

814
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,520
I'm going to work on the weekend.

815
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,720
I'm laying.

816
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:41,920
Sorry.

817
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,680
You know, there's a difference between a demo and a job.

818
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,980
It's not a job. It's a peaceful demo.

819
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,480
Why is that?

820
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,080
An earthquake happened.

821
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,620
An alarm went off.

822
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:54,380
A few police officers rushed out and started to attack us.

823
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,520
It's our job to protect the people.

824
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,380
Police officers protect power.

825
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:01,220
There's a video. It's been turned into a mobile unit.

826
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,220
Hey! Hey!

827
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,620
You kids, shut up.

828
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,120
Get out.

829
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,220
As I said earlier,

830
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:17,880
I'm the one who sent them to the demo.

831
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,880
They're not to be blamed.

832
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,480
If you want to get rid of them, I'll be in charge.

833
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,620
What's going on with the school?

834
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,380
I'm sorry.

835
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,220
The police are calling for you.

836
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,520
I'll let you know.

837
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,020
I'm sorry.

838
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:32,980
Get out.

839
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,480
Excuse me.

840
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,580
What's going on?

841
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:41,420
Mr. Okada took our kids to the street?

842
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,680
Please explain.

843
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:46,480
I'm sorry for what happened to our kids.

844
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,380
I'm sorry.

845
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:54,480
Couldn't you have done it a little cuter?

846
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,820
I didn't do it.

847
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:58,180
You put a tattoo on your face.

848
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:00,880
What about music?

849
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,880
You said you'd start a unit with Yuta.

850
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:09,320
That's why I went to the demo to change something.

851
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,320
What's with the attitude?

852
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:17,120
You're only thinking about living a comfortable life.

853
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,780
It's not comfortable.

854
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:31,180
Not at all.

855
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:33,680
Not even now.

856
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,280
That's why I want you to choose your own future.

857
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,280
I want to live a comfortable life.

858
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,280
I've been thinking about it for you.

859
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:47,280
I've been thinking about it for you.

860
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,280
Have you ever thought about it?

861
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:57,780
I don't have to think about it.

862
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,780
Are you okay?

863
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:12,280
Oh, it's you.

864
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,280
Good evening.

865
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,280
Be careful.

866
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,280
The police are looking for you.

867
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,280
If you need anything, just let me know.

868
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,280
Thank you.

869
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,280
I'm sorry.

870
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,280
I'm sorry.

871
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,280
I'm sorry.

872
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:23,280
I'll be your replacement for Okada when you graduate.

873
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,280
What?

874
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:27,280
He's not as good as you, so do your best.

875
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,280
Okay, thank you.

876
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,280
You're welcome.

877
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,280
I'm sorry.

878
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,280
I have to fix this habit.

879
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,280
I'm going to bring the booth to the club.

880
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,280
I can't study here.

881
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,280
I see.

882
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:16,280
I have to bring the documents.

883
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:19,280
Look, I'm a god now.

884
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,280
It's a lot of work.

885
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,280
Are you going to look at it again?

886
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,280
Are you really cleaning?

887
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,280
It's been re-opened.

888
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,280
I just wiped it.

889
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,280
I'm sorry.

890
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,280
Hey.

891
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,280
Hey.

892
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,280
Help me if you're in my way.

893
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:13,280
I'm not the only one being suspended.

894
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,280
Don't walk around the place you wiped.

895
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,280
You're still wet.

896
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,280
Okay.

897
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,280
I'm sorry.

898
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:50,280
I'm sorry.

899
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:15,280
Are you going to wait here until it dries?

900
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,280
I'm sorry.

901
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,280
What's wrong?

902
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,280
Did you check the application?

903
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,280
What are you going to do with the key?

904
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,280
If you take the key, you'll be suspended.

905
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,280
Shut up.

906
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,280
Hey.

907
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,280
Let go of the rules!

908
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,280
Let go.

909
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,280
Let go.

910
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,280
Let go.

911
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:54,280
Let go.

912
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:56,280
Let go.

913
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,280
Let go.

914
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,280
What are you doing?

915
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,280
I'm just checking the application.

916
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,280
It's a long way from the base.

917
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,280
You can't smoke here.

918
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,280
I'm sorry.

919
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,280
Hey.

920
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,280
Let go.

921
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,280
Why?

922
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,280
Captain, stop smoking.

923
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,280
That's weird.

924
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,280
Let go.

925
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,280
Why?

926
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,280
Let go.

927
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,280
Wait.

928
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:40,280
Let go.

929
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,280
Let go.

930
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,280
Let go.

931
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:50,280
Let go.

932
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,280
I'm going home.

933
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,280
Another date?

934
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,280
I don't know.

935
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,280
Dating and having a girlfriend are important.

936
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,280
For example, sex?

937
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,280
No way.

938
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,280
Rock, paper, scissors.

939
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,280
Rock, paper, scissors.

940
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,280
What do you mean?

941
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,280
What do you mean?

942
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:26,280
Do you think you can have fun with your friends?

943
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,280
Yes.

944
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:32,280
Do you think you can change if you shout on the street?

945
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,280
I don't understand.

946
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,280
Look at reality.

947
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:39,280
You give up and you'll have more fun.

948
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,280
Shut up.

949
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,280
I'm serious.

950
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:46,280
You don't think about anything.

951
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,280
Think about yourself.

952
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,280
I'm thinking.

953
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:52,280
Think.

954
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,280
People change.

955
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,280
I want you to change.

956
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,280
How?

957
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,280
Think about yourself.

958
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:21,280
I think we're fundamentally different.

959
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:23,280
We're the same.

960
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:28,280
I knew you from kindergarten.

961
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:31,280
I saw you for the first time.

962
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:39,280
I did the same thing for the first time.

963
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:49,280
Do you have any other friends?

964
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:18,280
I'm sorry.

965
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:30,280
This is good.

966
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,280
Right?

967
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,280
Excuse me.

968
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:50,280
Please turn off the music.

969
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,280
It's annoying.

970
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:58,280
Where are you from?

971
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,280
I'm from Kisaburo.

972
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,280
What's this?

973
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,280
A music player.

974
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,280
You're a high school student.

975
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,280
Show me your stuff.

976
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,280
What is it?

977
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:24,280
You don't have a special certificate.

978
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,280
Do you have a card?

979
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:30,280
I do, but I don't need it.

980
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,280
Please help me.

981
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,280
I don't have a cell phone.

982
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,280
Calm down.

983
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,280
I don't have a cell phone.

984
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,280
Please help me.

985
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,280
Thank you.

986
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:51,280
I'll take you home.

987
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,280
You can go home.

988
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,280
I'm the one playing music.

989
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,280
I'll just go home and show you.

990
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,280
I'm sorry I can't help you.

991
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:52,800
so

992
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,800
I'm sorry.

993
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:10,800
Good morning.

994
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:12,800
Good morning.

995
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:15,800
Stand up.

996
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:16,800
Stand up.

997
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:22,800
Attention.

998
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:25,800
Stand up.

999
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,800
Today we have a special guest.

1000
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,800
Please welcome him.

1001
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:38,800
Please come in.

1002
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,800
Please come in.

1003
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,800
The Self-Defense Force?

1004
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,800
That's scary.

1005
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:51,800
What's going on?

1006
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:52,800
I'm surprised.

1007
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:54,800
I'm surprised.

1008
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:01,800
We will have a special discussion with the Self-Defense Force.

1009
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,800
Students who haven't heard the speech don't need to hear it.

1010
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,800
Please be seated in room 305.

1011
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,800
Please go to your seats.

1012
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:22,800
3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 19, 21, 23, 25.

1013
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:24,800
Why do we have to go back?

1014
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,800
That's right.

1015
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:29,800
The Self-Defense Force has to have a nationality.

1016
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,800
I live in this country.

1017
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:35,800
I think it has something to do with it.

1018
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,800
It's a decision to protect the country.

1019
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,800
If you don't go out soon, you'll be suspended.

1020
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,800
We heard about the Komare incident.

1021
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,800
Don't talk about it.

1022
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,800
You're Japanese, right?

1023
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:50,800
Please go back to your seats.

1024
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,800
This class is really troublesome.

1025
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,800
Everyone else, go to bed.

1026
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,800
I'm going to bed because the teacher told me to.

1027
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,800
Yes, yes. Anything is fine.

1028
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:10,800
What's wrong?

1029
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:12,800
That...

1030
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:34,800
What?

1031
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,800
What does that mean?

1032
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:38,800
The other day, the teacher said that the teacher was suspended.

1033
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,800
Yes, he said that.

1034
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,800
The teacher is too strange.

1035
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:45,800
He's not a teacher.

1036
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:47,800
We're like criminals.

1037
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:49,800
I don't understand.

1038
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,800
Let's ask for a system of surveillance.

1039
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:54,800
Let's do that.

1040
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:56,800
That's too much.

1041
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:57,800
Why?

1042
01:15:58,800 --> 01:15:59,800
There are many bad tricks.

1043
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:01,800
That's right.

1044
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,800
It's easy to criticize.

1045
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:05,800
But we should think about something more neutral.

1046
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:09,800
So, did anything good happen when the surveillance camera was installed?

1047
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:10,800
No.

1048
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,800
But it's always like this, right?

1049
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,800
That's why we don't need to accept it.

1050
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:17,800
Right, Kou?

1051
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:20,800
Yes.

1052
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,800
Let's go to the principal with this.

1053
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:27,800
Let's go.

1054
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:35,800
What?

1055
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:37,800
Let's go together.

1056
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,800
You're going to the principal again?

1057
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,800
I don't want to be a problem.

1058
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:48,800
What's wrong?

1059
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,800
Let's go together.

1060
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:50,800
We're going.

1061
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:53,800
Let's go together.

1062
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,800
I didn't expect it.

1063
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,800
But I'm not disappointed when I see the school.

1064
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:04,800
Let's go together.

1065
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:07,800
Let's go together.

1066
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:12,800
Let's go together.

1067
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,800
To be honest, it's good to have you in the group.

1068
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:20,800
I'm happy.

1069
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:25,800
If you give me a score, I'll have to see your ugly face.

1070
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:26,800
What are you talking about?

1071
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:28,800
You love me.

1072
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:29,800
No, no.

1073
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,800
I want to see it every day.

1074
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,800
Please listen to me.

1075
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,800
You guys are annoying.

1076
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,800
The principal is weird.

1077
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,800
He doesn't come out until I tell him.

1078
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,800
Please give me a picture.

1079
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,800
The students are talking.

1080
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,800
I'm sorry to say that this is the end of the interview.

1081
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,800
Please go to the exit.

1082
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,800
I want to send it to you.

1083
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:53,800
I understand.

1084
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,800
Thank you very much.

1085
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:55,800
I'm sorry.

1086
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,800
I'm going to listen to the students.

1087
01:17:58,800 --> 01:17:59,800
Please.

1088
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:02,800
Please go to the police station.

1089
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:04,800
Let's stop here for now.

1090
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:06,800
Thank you.

1091
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:08,800
Please.

1092
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:15,800
What is it?

1093
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:32,800
What is it?

1094
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,800
What?

1095
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:02,800
What?

1096
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,800
I'm telling you from the bottom of my heart.

1097
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,800
You may think that the rules of this school are strict.

1098
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,800
But the world is much more strict.

1099
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,800
If you go out into society, you will not be forgiven.

1100
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,800
It's strange to follow the wrong society.

1101
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:49,800
Then let's assume that the education committee has given you the necessary.

1102
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:51,800
I...

1103
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,800
Even if the policy changes, from next year...

1104
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:58,800
You will graduate from school by then.

1105
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,800
You will not be treated as a child.

1106
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,800
Why are you doing this?

1107
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:07,800
That's right.

1108
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:27,800
Is everyone here?

1109
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,800
Yes.

1110
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:40,800
Oh, there it is.

1111
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:47,800
Hello.

1112
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:56,800
Hello.

1113
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:03,800
Hello.

1114
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:11,800
Yuta.

1115
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,800
Surprise!

1116
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:16,800
Stop it.

1117
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:20,800
Hurry up.

1118
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:22,800
You are good friends.

1119
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:24,800
You are good friends.

1120
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:26,800
Let's all toast.

1121
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:28,800
Let's toast.

1122
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:31,800
Cheers.

1123
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:48,800
It's Kono's turn.

1124
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,800
It's difficult to do it anywhere.

1125
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:55,800
Can you do it?

1126
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:57,800
You can do it.

1127
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:00,800
Scream out of the balcony.

1128
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:02,800
Kono, please.

1129
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:04,800
Please.

1130
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:06,800
Kono.

1131
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:08,800
Who is it?

1132
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:10,800
Is it that girl?

1133
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:12,800
I told you not to do it.

1134
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:13,800
I'm sorry.

1135
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:23,800
It's okay, right?

1136
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:25,800
I'm hungry.

1137
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:27,800
Eat, eat.

1138
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:29,800
It's good.

1139
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:31,800
It's good.

1140
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:33,800
It's good.

1141
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:35,800
You can't eat it.

1142
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:37,800
It's good.

1143
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:39,800
It's not mine.

1144
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:40,800
It's sharp.

1145
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:42,800
It's dangerous.

1146
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,800
I like you, Atachan.

1147
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,800
I like you, too.

1148
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:05,800
I like you, too.

1149
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,800
You have to say something new.

1150
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,800
I couldn't think of anything.

1151
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:17,800
Before you two come back,

1152
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:19,800
I'll make it romantic.

1153
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:22,800
Let's go.

1154
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:24,800
I'll put candles in the kitchen.

1155
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:26,800
Okay.

1156
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:41,800
I have a lighter.

1157
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:43,800
Thank you.

1158
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:47,800
I'm sorry, Tom.

1159
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:49,800
I'm going to school.

1160
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:51,800
It's okay.

1161
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:53,800
See you later.

1162
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:58,800
Okay.

1163
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:06,800
I sometimes think about it.

1164
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:08,800
Okay.

1165
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:12,800
If I met Yuta for the first time at college,

1166
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,800
would we have been friends?

1167
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:22,800
Hey, Oto.

1168
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,800
He hasn't changed a bit since he was a kid.

1169
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,800
That's why you like him.

1170
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:34,800
Yuta.

1171
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:40,800
I'm sorry.

1172
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:42,800
I'm going to school.

1173
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:44,800
I'm sorry.

1174
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:46,800
Wait.

1175
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,800
Take the rest of the candles.

1176
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:51,800
Is it okay?

1177
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:53,800
Of course.

1178
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:55,800
Everyone is hungry.

1179
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:57,800
Thank you.

1180
01:24:58,800 --> 01:24:59,800
I'm going to school.

1181
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:10,800
I'm sorry.

1182
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:12,800
I'm sorry.

1183
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:14,800
I'm sorry.

1184
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:16,800
I'm sorry.

1185
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:18,800
I'm sorry.

1186
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:20,800
I'm sorry.

1187
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:22,800
I'm sorry.

1188
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:24,800
I'm sorry.

1189
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:26,800
I'm sorry.

1190
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:28,800
I'm sorry.

1191
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:30,800
I'm sorry.

1192
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:32,800
I'm sorry.

1193
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:34,800
I'm sorry.

1194
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:36,800
I'm sorry.

1195
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:38,800
I'm sorry.

1196
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:40,800
I'm sorry.

1197
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:42,800
I'm sorry.

1198
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:44,800
I'm sorry.

1199
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:46,800
I'm sorry.

1200
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:08,800
Okay.

1201
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:10,800
I'm sorry.

1202
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:23,800
What?

1203
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:24,800
I don't know.

1204
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:25,800
Come in.

1205
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:26,800
Come in.

1206
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:38,800
Tyrone?

1207
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:42,800
What are you doing here?

1208
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:43,800
Okuro-san.

1209
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:44,800
Come in.

1210
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,800
Is there anyone who has fish allergy?

1211
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,800
I have some for everyone, turn around.

1212
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,800
I don't need it.

1213
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,800
If you don't eat, you won't be able to hold your body.

1214
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:14,800
It's my treat.

1215
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:15,800
You don't have to pay.

1216
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:17,800
Here.

1217
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,800
I don't want to be treated like that.

1218
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,800
It's not a strategy or anything.

1219
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:25,800
You can't eat what you've been given.

1220
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:29,800
Here, eat it.

1221
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:34,800
Eat it.

1222
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:42,800
Eat it.

1223
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:45,800
Eat it.

1224
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:50,800
Eat it.

1225
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:55,800
Eat it.

1226
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,800
If you don't eat, everyone here will be in trouble.

1227
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:01,800
Everyone, everyone.

1228
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:02,800
Be serious.

1229
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:10,800
Oh.

1230
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:12,800
Oh.

1231
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:18,800
Oh.

1232
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:21,800
What a waste.

1233
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,800
You shouldn't be so concerned about food.

1234
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:33,800
I'm done.

1235
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:36,800
I don't want to go to college.

1236
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:39,800
I'm going home.

1237
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:41,800
I don't want to go.

1238
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:57,800
Look at this.

1239
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:08,800
It's a new one.

1240
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:12,800
It's a new one.

1241
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:14,800
Thank you.

1242
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,800
Thank you.

1243
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:22,800
It's delicious.

1244
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:24,800
I'm starting to talk.

1245
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:26,800
It's delicious.

1246
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:28,800
I'm going home.

1247
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:30,800
I'm going home.

1248
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:32,800
I'm going to go to the library.

1249
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:37,800
One day, a teacher at school

1250
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,800
lectured in front of a student.

1251
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:44,800
He said,

1252
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,800
I can't be a good person

1253
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:51,800
if I don't get a perfect score in the test.

1254
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:54,800
Yes.

1255
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:57,800
If you eat shit, believe it.

1256
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,800
If you eat shit, believe it.

1257
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:09,800
The greatest thing in the world is the electronic calculator.

1258
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:23,800
Thank you.

1259
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:33,800
Thank you.

1260
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:03,800
Thank you.

1261
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:12,800
The test was really good.

1262
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:19,800
Why did you feel so bad?

1263
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:26,800
I was frustrated that I could only

1264
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:29,800
talk to my parents.

1265
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:30,800
I was frustrated.

1266
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:33,800
I wanted to do more.

1267
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:34,800
Let's go to the morning.

1268
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:35,800
Let's go.

1269
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:36,800
Let's go to the morning.

1270
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,800
I don't care how much I'm beaten.

1271
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:42,800
I want to have more fun.

1272
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:45,800
I can't wait.

1273
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:48,800
Shut up.

1274
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:57,800
It's time for the graduation ceremony.

1275
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:58,800
Let's start.

1276
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:02,800
First, stand up and say your name.

1277
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,800
Stand in front of the principal and say your name.

1278
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,800
You will be given a certificate of graduation.

1279
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,800
Take it with both hands and say your name.

1280
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,800
And then go to the national flag.

1281
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:22,800
Thank you.

1282
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:26,800
Thank you.

1283
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:32,800
I heard about this school.

1284
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:38,800
A few students came to the principal's office yesterday.

1285
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:45,800
They asked me to manage this school.

1286
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,800
To put it bluntly, the purpose is one thing.

1287
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:56,800
To respect the will and freedom of the students at the educational site.

1288
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:05,800
I will be very supportive of their pure thoughts.

1289
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,800
But, in order to do that,

1290
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:18,800
the education itself cannot be done without the security of the body.

1291
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:23,800
The other day,

1292
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:31,800
the educational site, which was supposed to be safe, was attacked.

1293
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,800
The whole thing happened.

1294
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:38,800
It's very unfortunate.

1295
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,800
What I want to tell you is that

1296
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:50,800
if you want to do it,

1297
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:56,800
you can reconsider the security system.

1298
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:02,800
But,

1299
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:05,800
you have to take responsibility for your freedom.

1300
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,800
The terrorist attack that happened in Hong Kong the other day,

1301
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,800
that threatened the school's safety,

1302
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:24,800
that turned the safety from the school to the ground,

1303
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:29,800
and the people who did such an act,

1304
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,800
please take responsibility.

1305
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:37,800
But, under those conditions,

1306
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:40,800
we will consider the security system.

1307
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:42,800
It's not a promise!

1308
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:43,800
I didn't hear that condition!

1309
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:44,800
It's a promise!

1310
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:45,800
What is that?

1311
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,800
Why are you saying that now?

1312
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:48,800
Give me back my time!

1313
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:49,800
Listen to me!

1314
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:50,800
Listen to me!

1315
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:51,800
Wait a minute!

1316
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:52,800
I'm not convinced!

1317
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:53,800
Hey, you in the back!

1318
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:55,800
What is it?

1319
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:56,800
Excuse me.

1320
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,800
I don't know who did the car accident.

1321
01:34:58,800 --> 01:34:59,800
Excuse me.

1322
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:00,800
Go ahead.

1323
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:04,800
I don't think there's a need to remove the security system.

1324
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:07,800
It has a side effect, and I think it works.

1325
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:08,800
Sit down!

1326
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,800
It's completely private.

1327
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,800
I think it's because there are some bad things in the school.

1328
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:12,800
What do you think?

1329
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,800
The students who don't know Japanese manners

1330
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,800
are taking advantage of others' effort.

1331
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:17,800
What are Japanese manners?

1332
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:18,800
I think this system is necessary.

1333
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,800
I think it's necessary too.

1334
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:22,800
Rules are important.

1335
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:25,800
If there are no rules, things will get complicated.

1336
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,800
It may not be good for everyone,

1337
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,800
but I think it's more important to stand up for yourself.

1338
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:31,800
If you think so,

1339
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:34,800
you can just go to war and kill the carrots.

1340
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:35,800
But you're killing them right in front of you.

1341
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:36,800
It's a big mistake.

1342
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:37,800
I want to go home soon.

1343
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,800
It's not good to think that it's a big mistake.

1344
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:41,800
Think about it.

1345
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:04,800
Excuse me.

1346
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:07,800
Please listen.

1347
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:10,800
I'm sorry.

1348
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:38,800
I did that by myself.

1349
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,800
I was just kidding.

1350
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:41,800
Excuse me.

1351
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:42,800
Thank you.

1352
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:50,800
Stop messing around.

1353
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:52,800
Stop messing around!

1354
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:53,800
Do something about it!

1355
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:54,800
Stop it!

1356
01:36:56,300 --> 01:36:57,800
Stop it!

1357
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:04,800
There's a hole.

1358
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,800
The students got a hole.

1359
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:15,420
Test...

1360
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:29,100
Great!

1361
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:31,360
Good!

1362
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,360
What did you get??

1363
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:38,360
What's going on?

1364
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:40,360
It's a good thing we're in elementary school!

1365
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:42,360
What?

1366
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:44,360
It's a good thing we're in elementary school!

1367
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:08,360
What was that?

1368
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:16,360
Like I said earlier...

1369
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:18,360
the school president officials don't want to be talked about in court

1370
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:20,360
as of now.

1371
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:22,360
We will find out the pending member and bring them to court.

1372
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:24,360
Other students...

1373
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:26,360
shouldn't definately agree to not strengthening school sustainances,

1374
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:33,500
but you can call the Department of

1375
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:35,820
Come on!

1376
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:37,660
I'm sorry.

1377
01:38:37,660 --> 01:38:40,660
Oh, I'm sorry.

1378
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:42,160
Thank you.

1379
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,360
I'm sorry.

1380
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:22,360
Ouch.

1381
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:23,360
Ouch.

1382
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:24,360
Ouch.

1383
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:26,360
I'm sorry.

1384
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,360
Are you 14?

1385
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:37,360
Next week.

1386
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,360
Then,

1387
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:43,360
you're an adult now.

1388
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:06,360
I'm sorry.

1389
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:32,360
What are you doing?

1390
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:36,360
Why are you crying?

1391
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:38,360
I'm not crying.

1392
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:39,360
Are you okay?

1393
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:41,360
I'm okay.

1394
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:43,360
Are you okay?

1395
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:44,360
No.

1396
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:48,360
If you're going to play something, make it a fun song.

1397
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:52,360
For example?

1398
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:54,360
For example?

1399
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,360
What should I say?

1400
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:06,360
I'm sorry.

1401
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:36,360
I'm sorry.

1402
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,360
Bye.

1403
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:11,360
I'll be back in the summer and in the new year.

1404
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:13,360
Come and play with me.

1405
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,360
Make friends with me.

1406
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:36,360
I'm sorry.

1407
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:56,360
Congratulations.

1408
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:00,360
Congratulations.

1409
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:03,360
Thank you.

1410
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,360
Thank you.

1411
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:21,360
Good luck.

1412
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:23,360
Good luck.

1413
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:32,360
Congratulations.

1414
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:36,360
Congratulations.

1415
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:39,360
Congratulations.

1416
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:41,360
Congratulations.

1417
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:56,360
Congratulations.

1418
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:58,360
That's right.

1419
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:02,360
I'm so happy!

1420
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:04,360
I'm so happy!

1421
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:06,360
I'm so happy!

1422
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:16,360
It's not like that.

1423
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:18,360
I'm usually this tall.

1424
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:20,360
I'm this tall.

1425
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:22,360
I can only speak.

1426
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:24,360
I'm this tall.

1427
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:26,360
Look at me.

1428
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:29,360
It's scary.

1429
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:31,360
It's scary.

1430
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:33,360
It's not.

1431
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,360
Where did you buy this? It's the best.

1432
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:37,360
I made it.

1433
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:39,360
You made it?

1434
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:41,360
I should sell it.

1435
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:43,360
Why do you want to do this?

1436
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,360
I can sell it.

1437
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:47,360
You can definitely be a designer.

1438
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,360
I can definitely do that.

1439
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:51,360
Let's do it.

1440
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:53,360
Stop it.

1441
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:55,360
You ignored me when I said the same thing.

1442
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,360
Did I?

1443
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:59,360
Yes.

1444
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,360
I'm sorry.

1445
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,360
Why do you always ignore me?

1446
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:05,360
I don't know.

1447
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:07,360
Stop it.

1448
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:11,360
How about we go out for dinner?

1449
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:15,360
My parents are taking me out for dinner.

1450
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:17,360
Let's go.

1451
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:21,360
I'll go with you.

1452
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:23,360
I'll go with you.

1453
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:25,360
Together?

1454
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:27,360
I'm so nervous.

1455
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:29,360
I'm scared.

1456
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:31,360
It's okay.

1457
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:33,360
It's okay.

1458
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:35,360
I'm so nervous.

1459
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:37,360
See you next time.

1460
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:41,360
Congratulations.

1461
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:43,360
Bye.

1462
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,360
Bye.

1463
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:49,360
Bye.

1464
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,360
Bye.

1465
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:19,360
Let's go.

1466
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:21,360
I'm going to the apartment.

1467
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:23,360
I'm going to leave my house.

1468
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:25,360
I'm going to leave my house.

1469
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:27,360
Really?

1470
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,360
I'm going to give my mom a loan.

1471
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:31,360
I'm going to give my mom a loan.

1472
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:33,360
Really?

1473
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:35,360
See you next time.

1474
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:37,360
See you next time.

1475
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,360
I have a loan.

1476
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:43,360
I have a loan.

1477
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:45,360
You're going to give me a loan?

1478
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:47,360
It's going to take a lifetime.

1479
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:49,360
I don't have a loan.

1480
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:53,360
Okay.

1481
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:55,360
See you next time.

1482
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:59,360
Bye.

1483
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:01,360
Bye.

1484
01:47:47,360 --> 01:48:05,980
the

1485
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:08,780
the

1486
01:48:08,780 --> 01:48:16,460
filled

1487
01:52:16,460 --> 01:52:20,460
Thanks for watching!
