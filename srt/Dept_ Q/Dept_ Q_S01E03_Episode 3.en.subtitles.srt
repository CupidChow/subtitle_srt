1
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,960
Oh, my fucking tooth.

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,600
Hello, Merritt. We've been thinking that

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,680
maybe we've made a mistake.

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,840
We've not applied enough pressure
to properly motivate you.

5
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,040
So today,
we're gonna turn up the pressure.

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,760
Literally.

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,560
See if that jogs your memory.

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,840
As you'll see, your body can adjust

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,320
to the increases
in air pressure over time.

10
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,680
But it's a bit uncomfortable.

11
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,640
Ah, you're fine.

12
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,960
As long as nobody comes
and opens those vents above you.

13
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,720
Of course,

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,160
if that happened,

15
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,360
with the increase of pressure,

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,200
well, let's just say it'd be a big mess.

17
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,440
The sort where the undertaker uses a mop
to gather you up.

18
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,840
I don't really know
how much of it you'd feel,

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,080
your body instantly imploding like that.

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,160
I hope you won't have to find out.

21
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,040
Get it together, you fucking loser.

22
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,800
Yes. I will tell him.

23
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,600
I will tell him that too.

24
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,960
-Tell me what?
-You're not answering your phone.

25
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,600
-For good reason. What's the second thing?
-That was the second thing.

26
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,080
What's the first thing?

27
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,080
William Lingard's gone missing.

28
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,000
-When?
-He ran away last night.

29
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,080
Threw a television set through a window
and escaped.

30
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
Last night.

31
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,320
At the same moment
you had your press conference.

32
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,120
Interesting timing, don't you think?

33
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,400
He's watching me on the telly,

34
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,360
throws his telly out the window,
runs away.

35
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
That's pretty interesting.

36
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,040
Do you think it's possible
your press conference provoked him?

37
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,440
It provoked the fuck out of me,
but that's not the question.

38
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,080
The right question is, where's he going?

39
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,280
What time did Merritt buy those crisps?

40
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,640
The transaction went through at 10:22 a.m.
Just after they left Oban.

41
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,560
Then what?

42
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,040
William was seen
by the assembly station just…

43
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,120
just before 11:00.

44
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,720
-Do we know what they were fighting about?
-William's hat. It blew overboard.

45
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,920
He tried to climb the rails
to get it back.

46
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,320
-It blew overboard?
-He threw it for some reason.

47
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,280
The wind picked it up
out of the camera frame.

48
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,840
And it was windy that day, yeah?

49
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,720
As it is at this moment. Very windy.

50
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,760
And very, very cold.

51
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,560
But it was nice inside, wasn't it?

52
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,440
Can I borrow that?

53
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,440
Why?

54
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,240
-Interesting.
-Yeah.

55
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,960
Excuse me, folks.

56
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,680
Thank you. Thank you.

57
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,320
So all these cameras were in place
four years ago, yeah?

58
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,640
Yes. I have seen the footage.

59
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,080
And Merritt is not in any of it
after she leaves William.

60
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,320
Right. So we're back where we started.

61
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,720
She was on the boat,
and then she wasn't on the boat. Wicked.

62
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are now berthed in…

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,240
So she hadn't been home for a while.

64
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,080
Not since she was a teenager.

65
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,000
She bought the tickets in the morning,
so it wasn't planned.

66
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,080
-They would have had to have been lucky.
-Fuck yeah.

67
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,880
No one could've known
William was gonna lose his hat

68
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,400
or that she would come
down here to find it.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,680
So a crime of opportunity. She comes upon
the wrong person at the right time?

70
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,480
No, they'd been watching her.

71
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,000
To follow someone everywhere they go,
day and night, without being seen,

72
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,840
it takes a lot of experience.

73
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,120
Or dedication, my friend.
Someone really fucking wanted her.

74
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,640
Talk about dark clouds.

75
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,040
The Lingard family had
a bloody thunderhead looming over them

76
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,440
that followed them to and fro
and everywhere in between.

77
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,120
I've never known such a multitude
of bad luck to afflict just one family.

78
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,680
First the mother dies,
the kids too wee to fend for themselves,

79
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,640
the dad too drunk to be of any help.

80
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,920
-Mum died, how?
-Is that not in Merritt Lingard's file?

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,720
It was an auto accident.

82
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,160
I'm asking you. As the local law,
you must have a point of view.

83
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,280
It's my point of view
that what happened is what's in the file.

84
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,400
She fell asleep at the wheel
and drove off the road.

85
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,800
-Is there an accident report?
-There is indeed.

86
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,080
In Glasgow, where it actually happened.

87
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,000
You weren't curious?

88
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,160
It was inevitable.

89
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,600
The dark cloud?

90
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,760
The darkest.

91
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,880
-What was she doing in Glasgow?
-I haven't the faintest idea.

92
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,160
But I can tell you that the boy stepped up
and rose to the occasion.

93
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,840
He was a fine student and a fine athlete.
As good a lad as any.

94
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,720
-And Merritt?
-Trouble.

95
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,960
Always one foot in the inferno.
Certainly no stranger to this office.

96
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,560
Not the obvious type
to grow up to be a prosecutor.

97
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,080
Well, you walk in on your brother
getting his head stoved in,

98
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,680
it has an effect.

99
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,040
Yes, could you please give us some details
of the attack on William Lingard?

100
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,040
Harry Jennings, a local offender,
was behind a string of robberies.

101
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,920
He broke into the Lingard house
when William was home asleep.

102
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,880
-And Merritt?
-She was out.

103
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,080
Getting high, most likely,
with some bloke.

104
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,320
She liked them, if you know what I mean.

105
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,680
What about this other guy that beat him,
this… Harry Jennings?

106
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,560
He died trying to evade arrest.

107
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,640
-Died how?
-He jumped off the ferry.

108
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,680
He tried to run away
by getting on a ferry?

109
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,360
He wasn't a very bright lad.

110
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,960
He thought he'd given us the slip,
but we phoned the captain.

111
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,600
And when the captain
and the first mate approached him,

112
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,880
he jumped overboard.

113
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,080
Boat doesn't seem high enough
to kill somebody.

114
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,120
It is if you're drunk enough,
and Harry Jennings most definitely was.

115
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,160
His blood alcohol peaked
at somewhere between blootered

116
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,040
and completely fucking wrecked.

117
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,080
Speaking of which,

118
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,120
is there a particular pub
that I can find Jamie Lingard?

119
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,040
Nope. The man dried out some years ago.
Stays out the pub.

120
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,000
Right now, you'll probably find him
down the harbor,

121
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,360
playing cards with the other fishermen.

122
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,440
He's still fishing?

123
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,600
Not many fish left now, but up here,

124
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,440
they give it a go
right up till their wraith takes the helm.

125
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,560
-How poetic.
-Mm, regular Rabbie Burns, me.

126
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,160
Must be nice to have the time.

127
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,320
Well, thanks so much
for sharing some of it.

128
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,440
-I saw you on the telly.
-Yeah?

129
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,560
I thought you were gonna throw up
right there and then.

130
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,240
Scottish weather doesn't agree with me.

131
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,120
I've known you for all of two minutes,
and already I get the feeling

132
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,840
that there's not much
that does agree with you.

133
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,320
No wonder there's no crime up here.
You just see through it all.

134
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,800
There's not much crime here

135
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,280
because all the arseholes are
down in London.

136
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,080
-Ah.
-I bring it up because it made me wonder.

137
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,040
Do you really believe
what you were saying up there?

138
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,200
You honestly think you're gonna find her?

139
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,360
Honestly?

140
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,320
I don't know if anyone will find her,

141
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,800
but it'd be nice to know
what happened to her.

142
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,200
Because you're curious?

143
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,400
Because I'm not big
on the dark cloud theory.

144
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,680
What you doing?

145
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,040
Police.

146
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,760
We don't have to break every rule.

147
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,680
Very tidy.

148
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,240
Uh-huh.

149
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,080
Cozy little place like this,

150
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,880
it's so hard to believe
that anything bad could happen.

151
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,840
Well, bad things did happen.

152
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,600
Not a lot of sarcasm in Syria, I take it.

153
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
Very little, sir.

154
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,680
Pictures of William.

155
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,800
No pictures of Merritt.

156
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,880
Because she was always
a right cunt, that one.

157
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,600
Mr. Lingard, police.

158
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,640
-DCI--
-I don't care who you are, cop.

159
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,040
You cannae just walk intae a man's house.

160
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,560
You're absolutely right.
I do apologize. Door was open.

161
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,520
What you doin' here?

162
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,120
We're reopening the investigation
into your daughter's disappearance.

163
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,760
-Why?
-New evidence has surfaced.

164
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,960
What new evidence?

165
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,720
Excuse me for asking, but why do you call
your daughter a right cunt?

166
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,560
Because that she was.

167
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,240
And yet, at the age of 24,
she became William's guardian, not you.

168
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,200
I wasn't given much choice in the matter.

169
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,160
She wanted to drag me to court
to prove I was unfit to be his dad.

170
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,840
You didn't challenge the petition.

171
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,720
I'm no fancy lawyer.
You think I stood a chance?

172
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
Well, you also had a criminal record.

173
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,360
Drunk driving, 2001. Common assault, 2003.

174
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,160
I never said she was wrong.

175
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,560
It's true. I was drunk most of that time.

176
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,880
Even in church.

177
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,040
She did the right thing.

178
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,960
I was unfit.

179
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,000
And then she comes to find you
12 years later. Any idea why?

180
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,120
I didn't even know she was coming at all.

181
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,680
I told your lot last time.

182
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,280
She wanted nothing to do with me.

183
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,840
-When was the last time you saw William?
-Day after, in hospital.

184
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,840
That's it? You never saw him again?

185
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,040
I couldn't. Too hard.

186
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,760
Even after Merritt disappeared
and you knew he had no one?

187
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,280
He was such a good boy.

188
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,760
So sweet, so smart.

189
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,440
Had so much promise.

190
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,280
I just couldn't see him like that.

191
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,560
Did you ever try to find them?
Merritt and William?

192
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,320
Why would I bother?
She clearly didn't want to be found.

193
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,080
And that's why you won't find her either.

194
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,240
I'm very good at finding things
that don't want to be found.

195
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,240
Yeah, outside of your self-control.

196
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,960
Thank you, Mr. Lingard.

197
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,440
She stole from me.

198
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,240
Stole what exactly?

199
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,840
A necklace. Belonged to Lila, her mum.

200
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
Was all I had left of hers.

201
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,280
It was mine, not Merritt's,
but she took it.

202
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,160
She knew what it meant,
but she took it anyway.

203
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,720
Just to hurt me.

204
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,160
Which she did.

205
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,920
Okay.

206
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,560
Thank you.

207
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,560
Life's already painful enough
without having one's family make it worse.

208
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,880
There it is.

209
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,600
Your ma learned
that there was no going home.

210
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,320
She tried many times,
but they wouldn't have her.

211
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,200
Not after I…

212
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,520
How did they put it?

213
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,840
"Undid her."

214
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,840
They cut her off.

215
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,040
They told her if she stayed with me,
she'd get nothing.

216
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,680
Even after you were born,
and then your brother.

217
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,080
-They wouldn't speak to her.
-She said they thought you were too old.

218
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,720
Aye, that they did.

219
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,960
But I could have been 20 years younger

220
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,000
and they would have thought
the same of me.

221
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,200
Because I was a fisherman.

222
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,560
Not a doctor or a lawyer

223
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,920
or, better still, a banker.

224
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,600
I thought I was saving her
from those posh Edinburgh folks,

225
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,760
so it broke my heart
to hear I was smothering her.

226
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,160
That she was so unhappy.

227
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,680
That she'd leave us all
and go back to them.

228
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,000
Well, she knew that they weren't
gonna give her any help

229
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,760
as long as she was with you.

230
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,840
Aye, as long as she was with me.
But she would have come home.

231
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,640
She wasn't coming home.

232
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,800
She would've made it right with them
and come back.

233
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,880
No.

234
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,920
There was no making it right.

235
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,360
She wanted them to put
something aside for me and William.

236
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,280
She would never abandon her children.

237
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,440
Is that really what you think?

238
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,440
All I want to say to you is…

239
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,080
as angry as you are with me,

240
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,200
I'm twice as angry with myself.

241
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,960
And maybe you knowing that

242
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,080
will make you less hell-bent all the time

243
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,600
on making me even angrier.

244
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,480
You were right about one thing.

245
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,640
You didn't save her.

246
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,520
She died

247
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,320
trying to save you.

248
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,840
Merritt.

249
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,280
Please, don't.

250
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,960
Fuck you!

251
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,440
Whatever happened on that island,
we won't find it in any file.

252
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,960
No, which is why
I need you to find William.

253
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,800
-You want me to find William?
-I just said I did.

254
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,360
And you will allow me to do this?
To look for him by myself?

255
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,400
Who better than Mr. "I'm good at finding
things that don't wanna be found"?

256
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,880
William won't be
as hard to locate as some.

257
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,200
Tell me something.

258
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,320
Back home, were you working
for the good guys or the bad guys?

259
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,080
When you know which is which,
please do tell me.

260
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,880
Night, William.

261
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,440
Could you please turn
the fucking noise down?

262
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,200
-Listen to it.
-I can't.

263
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,960
My eardrums have exploded
out of my fucking eyeballs.

264
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,480
Just fucking listen to it.

265
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,400
It's about you and me, all right?
How you make me feel.

266
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,640
I can't talk to you

267
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,120
I can talk to anyone

268
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,760
-I can talk to anyone…
-Okay, I get it.

269
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,640
You've made your point.

270
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,840
-Look, Mum fucked us both.
-There's another way you could put that.

271
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,240
I was thinking me and you could have…

272
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,840
could have a truce.

273
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,680
Truce, okay. What's that look like?

274
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,480
It looks like you stay out of my shit
and I stay out of yours.

275
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,680
Oh, that sounds great,
but we have to live together.

276
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,600
Until when?

277
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,840
Until you are old enough
to live on your own.

278
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,240
-Well, I think I'm old enough now.
-Oh, I beg to differ.

279
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,560
You know, you are really shit
at the whole father thing.

280
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,920
Oh, and you really excel
at the whole son thing.

281
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,360
Uh, stepson.

282
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,600
Compared to others in my situation,
I'm pretty fucking good.

283
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,680
Well, one's goal in life
should be to raise the bar.

284
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,040
Maybe… let's stop trying.

285
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,400
-Let's pretend we're in the army.
-In the army?

286
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,280
You have your duty and assignments,
and I have mine.

287
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,880
That only works
if you actually do your assignments.

288
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,400
Okay, if I do,
then will you leave me the fuck alone?

289
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
-No.
-Why not?

290
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,680
Because I am your commanding officer,
not your comrade.

291
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,400
Look, I'll make my bed, clean the toilet.

292
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,040
-Use your headphones for your other music.
-Fine.

293
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,040
Maybe not skip school.

294
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,240
-So much.
-It is so fucking boring.

295
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,800
Okay, look, look.

296
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,840
I do all of that, uh-huh,

297
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,640
and you try, just try, not to be
such a massive fucking arsehole.

298
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,360
I can try.

299
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,280
Nobody wanted this situation. I get it.

300
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,040
Let's not pretend it's anything more
than just an arrangement for now.

301
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Okay.

302
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
Good morning.

303
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,760
Since when do you smoke?

304
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,480
-Since a few minutes ago.
-Jesus.

305
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:48,240
I just, um, wanted to check in
after the other day, see how you're doing.

306
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,760
You know, I'm no stranger
to mental health problems.

307
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,920
You might remember that I had
my own wee meltdown a few years back.

308
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,200
Wee? You were talking in tongues
or something. It was fucking weird.

309
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,880
-I was not.
-Yeah.

310
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,120
That was just a joke Hardy made one time.

311
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,160
We all have our moments.

312
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,560
I mean, who hasn't had a panic attack
in this horrible world we live in, huh?

313
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,680
Rose, fuck sake.

314
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,840
Stop with the cute act and just tell me
what the fuck it is you want.

315
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,600
-I just…
-Just what? Just fucking what?

316
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,680
Would you let me join your new department?

317
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,920
Why on God's green earth
would you want that?

318
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,640
Because I haven't been
on an actual case in two years.

319
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,000
All they give me is
paperwork no one else wants to sort.

320
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,040
And, quite frankly,
it's better than doing nothing.

321
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,720
-What is it you think I'm doing?
-I have no idea.

322
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,440
But I know Akram's been helping you.

323
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,640
This morning, he asked me
to get him a pool car.

324
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,880
So?

325
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,400
So he's a civilian,
and you're letting him investigate.

326
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,800
He's my assistant.
He's assisting me in my investigation.

327
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,640
Is that how you think Moira would see it?

328
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,960
Oh, attagirl. Blackmail me.
That'll get you what you want every time.

329
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,560
The last thing I need

330
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,120
is another person down here
hogging all the air.

331
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,360
I could cover old leads.
Uh, take witness statements. Write up--

332
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,040
I'm doing all that.

333
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,800
-I'm a good digger.
-A what?

334
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,760
Research. Digging.
That's what I know how to do.

335
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,240
And Hardy knew that. He was the only one
who had me figured out.

336
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,640
-Took me under his wing.
-Ooh, did he, now?

337
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,400
Oh, don't say it like that.
The man's lying in a hospital bed.

338
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,560
You know, not many men offer to help
without strings.

339
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,080
There's always a string.

340
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,960
-Carl, that is just disgusting. He's--
-Hardy knew your old man.

341
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,240
-Oh.
-Yeah, he was his training officer.

342
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,480
-Hardy never said anything.
-He wouldn't.

343
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:36,360
So then Hardy would definitely want you
to take me on, wouldn't he?

344
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,840
We will try it for one day.

345
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,120
Thank you, Carl. Thank you. I--

346
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,760
Shut up. I'm not done.

347
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,840
You can have one day,

348
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,920
and if you manage to not annoy me
by the end of said day,

349
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,600
then maybe, maybe, I'll think about it.

350
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,160
Where do you want me?

351
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,560
For now, you can share
that desk with Akram.

352
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,120
-You'll speak to Moira? Make it official?
-Let's see how it goes.

353
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,720
Yeah, sure.

354
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,960
What cunt's been sleeping in my bed?

355
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,200
And what cunt's been eating my porridge?

356
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,600
And what cunt's gonna get the fuck out

357
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,040
before I huff and puff
and cut his fucking throat?

358
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,040
Well, go on, then.

359
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,600
What's your name?

360
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,880
I don't think the dog can talk.

361
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,120
Away you go, ya wee fuckin' prick!

362
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,560
Get tae fuck, ya fuckin' spastic!

363
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,800
Do you mind?

364
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,920
Your chewing, it's loud.

365
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,800
Misophonia.

366
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,640
What?

367
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,280
My dad had it. It's a thing
where a person's very sensitive to sounds.

368
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,960
I'm only sensitive
to annoying sounds, like chewing.

369
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,280
-And slurping.
-Oh, sorry.

370
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,160
Or your voice, frankly.

371
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,680
Were you close with your father?

372
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,080
You want to talk about my family?

373
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,040
I could give a shit about your family.
I'm asking about your father. You close?

374
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
Uh…

375
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,640
He divorced my mum when I was five.
Married a dental hygienist.

376
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,640
Actually, it was his dental hygienist.

377
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,720
-Do you talk to him still?
-Now and then.

378
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,480
Birthdays, holidays, that sort of thing.
But less and less.

379
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,560
He's got other kids now. Pretty soon,
I can imagine us not speaking at all.

380
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,680
And that would be okay?

381
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,160
It's not like there's a lot there
beyond that he made me with my mum.

382
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,360
Say he never spoke to you for 12 years.

383
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,920
What sort of thing
would make you wanna go and see him?

384
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,720
If he were sick.
You know? Dying. Say goodbye.

385
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,680
Any other reason?

386
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,000
You want to know why
Merritt went back to Mhòr.

387
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,400
-Why didn't you just say so?
-I'm trying to get to know you.

388
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,880
Ach, are you fuck.

389
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,560
Nah, Merritt's a totally different thing.

390
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,640
How so?

391
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,720
Well, her dad was a drunk. A shit.

392
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,360
He claims he had no idea she was coming,
that this was last minute.

393
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,040
So maybe it is as simple
as she was threatened and ran away.

394
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,120
-That's the obvious choice, sure.
-What's your theory, then?

395
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,480
You're asking me what I think?

396
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,040
No doubt you have your own clever insight
to counter my obvious one.

397
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,120
There was another reason
that Merritt went back to Mhòr,

398
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,520
and it had nothing to do with her dad.

399
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,080
I think she went back there
to see someone else.

400
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,080
You already knew that.

401
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,400
This was like a… teaching moment.

402
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,720
A what?

403
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,000
-You wanted to teach me.
-I don't teach.

404
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,560
Look at you,
being a right proper mentor and all.

405
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,520
-I'm no one's fucking mentor.
-You know, I'm touched, Carl, really.

406
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Are you through?

407
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,520
-Oh.
-Right.

408
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,520
Seeing as we don't have Merritt's phone,
start with her work diary.

409
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,240
Go back three months.

410
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,680
Look for strange appointments,
unexplained meetings,

411
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,960
notes that she made to herself.

412
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,440
Okay. Um, does this mean I get to stay?

413
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,080
Go through her bank statements.

414
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,080
And anything that stands out,
no matter how small.

415
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,680
Purchases she made.
Places she went that don't make sense.

416
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,440
Uh, what about her email threats?

417
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,520
All traced to different Internet cafés,
piggybacked from off-site.

418
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,640
Hmm. Be worth to see if anyone collected
any digital media from those places.

419
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,760
Anyone from here, I mean.

420
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,280
I doubt it, considering the investigation
wasn't exactly that thorough back then.

421
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,840
Which brings me
to another way of looking at this.

422
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,840
Was it deliberately fucked up?

423
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,960
What, seriously?

424
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,320
Well, team leader was Fergus Dunbar,
whose biggest case prior to this was

425
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,560
the Royal View Hotel housekeeping
robbery and blackmail scandal.

426
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,800
I don't know that one.

427
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,000
Right.

428
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,760
How did Dunbar get the case?
Who was it who made the decision?

429
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,240
You want us to investigate us?

430
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,680
Starting now, yeah. We look at everyone.

431
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,240
DCI Morck. How are you feeling?

432
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,040
I need a list of Merritt's colleagues,
the ones she worked most closely with.

433
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,640
I thought that maybe
you were having a heart attack.

434
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,120
That would include magistrates

435
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,320
and solicitors, obviously,
from the other side.

436
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,360
Well, you must surely have
their statements from last time.

437
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,000
Last time was bungled. I'd like to ask
my own questions this time.

438
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,920
In your own careful way, I'm sure.

439
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,240
Did you know
that Merritt was receiving death threats?

440
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,520
Working here, it would be unusual
if she hadn't been.

441
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,120
These particular threats
don't correlate to any particular case.

442
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,840
Just someone who wanted to kill her.

443
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,560
Among other things. Jesus.

444
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,960
She didn't mention this to you?

445
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,840
No, but then again, she wouldn't have.

446
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,760
-Meaning she didn't trust you?
-No.

447
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,320
Meaning that she was never one of us.

448
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,320
She wore the clothes,
she spoke the language,

449
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,160
but she was always,
as they say, on the outside looking in.

450
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,800
Because of who she was
or because of how she was treated at work?

451
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,160
Oh, do fuck off, Carl.

452
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,480
I gave her more opportunities than anyone.
I gave her my respect.

453
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,320
But Merritt, eh, she always wanted more.

454
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,640
She wanted your job?

455
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,360
She was in a hurry. Let's put it that way.

456
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,680
And then four years ago,
she kills herself, and you thought what?

457
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,080
I thought her darker side
had finally caught up with her.

458
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,520
-Her darker side?
-Merritt had secrets.

459
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,680
The answer to where she is now,
be it above or below ground,

460
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,880
is likely to be found in one of them.

461
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,120
That's all you're giving me?

462
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,360
That she, like the rest of the human race,
had secrets?

463
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,760
That's all I have.

464
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,400
Oh, and, DCI Morck,

465
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,080
in the future, I'd like you
to keep in mind that I'm lord advocate

466
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,560
and not some crim
you ambuscade in the car park.

467
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,480
If you wish to speak with me,
arrange it through my office.

468
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,560
"Ambuscade."

469
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,600
I'll remember that.

470
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,960
Hey. Wake up.

471
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,640
Who the fuck are you?

472
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,680
Did you find these in the wall?
Did you open the wall?

473
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
Open what wall?

474
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,680
The one upstairs.
The one that has been ripped open.

475
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,200
-You a cop?
-Please, answer my question.

476
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,360
-The other guy did that.
-What other guy?

477
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,440
-You are a cop.
-This guy?

478
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,560
Aye, him. The freak.

479
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,400
-Where is he now?
-You don't carry a gun, do you?

480
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,280
It's not allowed. My da was a cop.

481
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,960
What would I need a gun for?

482
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,320
The man that was here,
that opened the wall. Where is he now?

483
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,480
I don't have to tell you.

484
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,800
Where is he now?

485
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,400
It hurts, I know.

486
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,000
It's a pressure point.

487
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,960
Soon you will feel it
directly behind your eyes,

488
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,680
and then you will vomit.

489
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,440
He ran away. We don't know where he went.
He just ran down the road.

490
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,800
Thank you very much.

491
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,960
-Ah.
-Afternoon, Mrs. Marsh.

492
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,720
Can you not leave me be?

493
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,760
William Lingard isn't in there,
by any chance?

494
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,080
Of course he's not in here.
He's at Egley House.

495
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,720
He was, but he ran off two days ago.

496
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,640
-What makes you think he's here?
-This is CCTV from a mile up the road.

497
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,920
Oh, William.

498
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,560
He was here for a little while
after Merritt disappeared.

499
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,800
He'd know the way.

500
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,680
He may know the way, but he's not here.

501
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,200
So you'd have no problem
if we come in and take a look around?

502
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,920
I have a massive problem
with you coming in

503
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,160
and having a look around.

504
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,640
-Fred was a collector.
-Fred?

505
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,440
My ex-husband.

506
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,880
I only keep them up
because they're calming.

507
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,200
-So you're not religious?
-Not anymore.

508
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,520
No.

509
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,120
After we lost our baby,
my faith faded away,

510
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,680
along with my marriage.

511
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,080
I was lucky to get that job with William
when I did. It filled a void.

512
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,600
Merritt was always telling me
I was too close.

513
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,840
I hope you never find her.

514
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,760
-Excuse me?
-Carl.

515
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,560
I don't mean that in any cruel way.

516
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,760
No?

517
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,720
Merritt was
the most rueful person I've ever met.

518
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,120
Must be a relief for her, wherever she is.

519
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,200
Carl.

520
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,720
William!

521
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,520
I have to say, you know,
if I saw me on the telly,

522
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,680
I'd jump out of a window too.

523
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,720
This comes from the house?
From the box in the wall?

524
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,480
-Mm.
-Cormorant?

525
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,200
Or maybe a great northern diver.
A shorebird though.

526
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,440
Shorebird? You saw this bird on the water?

527
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,520
Maybe on the ferry?

528
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,240
That's the hat you wore on the ferry?

529
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,160
Can he write?

530
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,440
He draws beautifully.
You draw… beautifully.

531
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,280
He has aphasia.
He can draw, but he can't write.

532
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,800
You saw someone
with that hat on the ferry?

533
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,760
Not on the ferry.

534
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,680
At home.

535
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,680
You saw someone wearing that hat at home?

536
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,240
At home and on the ferry?

537
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,280
Mm.

538
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,120
With Merritt?

539
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,960
Scratch it!

540
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,520
Stop it.

541
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,080
Another reason people hate you.
Your brilliant sense of timing.

542
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,880
He's English.

543
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,600
I'm so sorry. I'll leave you to it.

544
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,120
Aw, please don't rush off on his account.

545
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,200
Another minute
and her and I would've been making plans.

546
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,120
How's your wife?

547
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
So I went up to Mhòr yesterday.

548
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,280
Talked with Jamie Lingard,
Merritt's father.

549
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,960
-Did you, now?
-Mm-hmm.

550
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,160
You'd have liked him.

551
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,200
Proper sweetie.

552
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,480
He said that when she was younger,

553
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,840
she was not at all
the upright citizen she became.

554
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,520
Not at all ambitious
or motivated to do anything

555
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,640
beyond looking for a good time.

556
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,640
Makes you wonder what happened to her.

557
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,680
Did you read the file on her?

558
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,760
Nah. Been super busy
playing squash and going to the cinema.

559
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,680
And?

560
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,200
Whatever happened on the boat
wasn't planned. Crime of opportunity.

561
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,120
-Well, we both agree on that.
-Bumped into the wrong someone.

562
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,160
That all you got?

563
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,520
I'm in bed reading a fucking file.
What do you expect?

564
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,400
-I really enjoyed your press conference.
-Oh, fuck off.

565
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,000
No, you looked like
you were in charge up there.

566
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,120
Once more, fuck off.

567
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,320
What happened?

568
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,920
Oh, I was ambushed. Wasn't prepared.

569
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,920
Really? 'Cause it looked a lot
like your wee arse dropped out.

570
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,880
Let's see how you deal with walking into
a room full of fucking journos.

571
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,280
I can't walk.

572
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,280
Can you get me a computer?

573
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,400
Depends.

574
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,400
You gonna pull the fucking cripple card
every time we have a row?

575
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,920
I might.

576
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,880
But if I'm gonna help you,
I'm gonna need a computer.

577
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,600
If I can't be out in the world
doing what I do normally,

578
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,760
I'm gonna have to do it
another way, aren't I?

579
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,120
I'll get you one.

580
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,480
Yep?

581
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,960
Word has it that your new assistant
is running around like a cop.

582
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,160
He is a cop.
Or he was, you know, back in Syria.

583
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,400
Except that, as I'm sure
you're well aware, this isn't Syria.

584
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,000
-No, there's actual sunshine in Syria.
-Carl.

585
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,920
Look, I gave him an errand, is all. Jesus.

586
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,800
His job is to sort and file.

587
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,280
Well, it's a waste of the man.
He's good. Annoying… but good.

588
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,480
And I'm gonna take Rose as well.
Turns out she's not as dumb as she looks.

589
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,440
A, you can't say things like that anymore,
and B, no, you're not.

590
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,040
We're getting close on Merritt Lingard.

591
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,120
Oh.

592
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,440
-Tell me.
-Not yet.

593
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,040
Right. I can only assume
you're full of your usual shite.

594
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,480
-Just give me Rose and a laptop.
-You already got one.

595
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,160
-Akram doesn't.
-He doesn't need one.

596
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,600
-Thanks, Mother. This was great.
-Where you going?

597
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,880
-To my office.
-Ah, would that it were so, hmm?

598
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,560
You seem to be forgetting
to turn up to your appointments.

599
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,080
I'm not forgetting.

600
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,640
Oh, well, then you seem to be forgetting
that these sessions are mandatory

601
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,880
when an officer's been involved
in a shooting.

602
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,240
Do you want me to actually solve cases
or sit around whining about my childhood?

603
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,480
Oh.

604
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,720
I shudder when I think of you as a child.

605
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,600
Go to the sessions or I'll give
your assignment to someone else.

606
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,240
So you ratted me out, huh?

607
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,200
-I'm worried about you.
-Oh, well, that must gall you.

608
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,160
I wasn't before,
but I am now, after your little episode.

609
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,400
I was dehydrated, okay?

610
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,360
I'd imagine you must have been,
after all that sweating.

611
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,880
So you watched it?

612
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,960
Several times, with and without sound.

613
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,800
I had a panic attack once.

614
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,000
-It wasn't a panic attack.
-On the day of my wedding.

615
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,520
-Before or after?
-During.

616
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,920
-The talky bit.
-Nice.

617
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,400
Except I couldn't speak,
so I couldn't say, "I do."

618
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,040
If I was a religious type,
I'd say God was trying to rescue me,

619
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,640
but as a person of science,
I'll just say I got lucky.

620
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,160
Lucky?

621
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,680
Well, it turns out
he already had a family back in Leeds.

622
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,520
-Wife, etc.
-Awesome.

623
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,440
Yeah.

624
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,080
Greedy fucker.

625
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,880
Not sure I could pull that off.
Fucking logistics alone, Jesus.

626
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,000
I'm sure it wasn't easy.
I mean, fair play to Albert.

627
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,840
Albert, yeah?

628
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,000
Mm-hmm?

629
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,120
Had you pegged
as more of a Jake or a Luke type.

630
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,120
Anyway,

631
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,080
in case you missed it,
that was me opening up.

632
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,720
Showing you how it's done.

633
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,360
Thank you, yeah. Very educational.

634
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,600
You're welcome.

635
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,760
They were here
when we got in this morning.

636
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,760
Every case Merritt Lingard ever worked on.

637
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,360
Okay, well, keep hold of them
for a week or so,

638
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,600
and then send them all
except the last five cases she worked on

639
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,240
back to the Procurator Fiscal.

640
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,840
-You are serious?
-You wanna go through 'em?

641
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,920
Shouldn't we?

642
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,320
Only out of desperation.
You are gonna go up to Mhòr tomorrow.

643
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,680
Weren't you and Akram just there?

644
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,120
We were. And it was so pretty,
we thought that you should see it too.

645
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,520
Really?

646
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,160
Right.

647
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,360
William Lingard was beaten
by Harry Jennings during a robbery, so--

648
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,960
Jennings died trying to escape.

649
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,560
-I know this.
-I'm just showing you I've read the file.

650
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,400
How about showing me instead that
you can wait until I'm fucking finished?

651
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,520
How about that?

652
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,200
I want you to go up there,
and I want you to chat up the local law.

653
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,960
Prick named Cunningham.

654
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,440
-Chat him up?
-You know, work him.

655
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,480
Something in particular
you're looking for?

656
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,280
Yeah, get him talking about the family,
about Jennings, anything

657
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,400
that he didn't tell me, basically.

658
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,440
Why wouldn't he want to tell you?

659
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,760
Carl and the constable
did not get off on the right foot.

660
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,640
-Huh. Imagine that.
-I've gotta go.

661
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,200
Wait. Does this mean
I'm only doing this because I'm a woman

662
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,480
and you think I can use that
to soften him up somehow?

663
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,080
-Or because I'm a good police offic--
-First one.

664
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,120
Jasper?

665
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,960
Martin!

666
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,800
Right, talk to me.

667
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,600
He got a call from his mother.

668
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,080
Next thing I know, he's cursing a storm,
and he's tearing the place up.

669
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,280
-I thought things were getting better.
-Apparently not.

670
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,520
-Where did he go?
-I don't know, but, um… he had a suitcase.

671
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,560
Fucking hell.

672
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,280
If there was no confrontation…
No altercation.

673
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,440
If there was no altercation,

674
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,360
why didn't you call
for an ambulance sooner, Mr. Finch?

675
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,480
It must have been obvious to you
that your wife's injuries were severe.

676
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,920
-…focused.
-Are you happy that's puréed enough?

677
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,760
-That's good.
-Okay.

678
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,840
He wants to get everything exactly right.

679
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,480
I've actually done this all by myself.

680
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,440
I'm so happy. I'm so proud of you.

681
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,800
I actually have.

682
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,080
I knew that we were going
to work together to make art.

683
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,320
"L. H."

684
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,600
"L. H."

685
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,600
"Why are you here?"

686
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,160
Oh fuck.

687
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,160
Hi, Mum.

688
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,680
I'm at home.

689
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,320
I'm just… getting ready for a date.

690
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,200
No, no, no, you've not met him,
but he's… he's very nice.

691
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,440
Um…

692
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,120
Very successful.

693
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,960
Runs his own

694
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,760
car service.

695
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,920
No, Mum, he's not an Uber driver.
He's the owner.

696
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,920
Yeah, it's, um…

697
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,280
Daniel.

698
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,280
Boobrie.

699
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,600
Yeah, Mum, that is his name.
Uh, look, I've gotta go.

700
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,560
Uh… I'm just out of the bath,
and I need to dry off, okay?

701
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,840
Love you. Bye.

702
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,240
Fuck.
