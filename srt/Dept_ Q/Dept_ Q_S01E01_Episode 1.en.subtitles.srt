1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,160
-What brought you to the door?
-Routine wellness.

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,240
Your man's daughter
in Lancaster called in.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,200
Said her dad hadn't returned her calls.
The door was open when I got here, so…

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,560
Open or unlocked?

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,640
Open.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,920
Body's in the chair.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,600
Okay.

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,560
Well, I'm gonna take a wild guess
and say that's the murder weapon.

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,280
Aye, probably stabbed in the head,
I'd say.

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,840
Let's not be hasty, D.I. Hardy.

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,120
He could have fallen onto the knife
in the kitchen there

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,320
and then stumbled back
into his favorite chair.

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,080
Grabbing the blanket as he went.

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,800
-Makes perfect sense, yeah.
-At least he was comfortable.

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,240
As for that knife in his head,
it's a beauty.

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,160
-I think the weapon came from here.
-Don't touch that.

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,800
Put your fucking hands
behind your back, yes?

18
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,920
Yes, sir.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,200
How long have you been on the job?
A month?

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,480
Three, sir.

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,800
Judging by the flowerpot outside,
the same number of times you've puked.

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,120
It's the smell, sir.

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,400
It's not rocket science.
Just open a window.

24
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,240
You checked them anyway, right?

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,880
Che… Checked them?

26
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,680
Yes, checked them.

27
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,320
Are they open? Are they closed?
Are they locked? Are they broken?

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,360
Is there another door?
Ooh, does it look forced?

29
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,960
Fucking anything
apart from, "Ooh, it smells,"

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,880
which we kind of already know.

31
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,720
I was instructed to wait for the team.

32
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,640
Then go outside and wait.

33
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,040
Or you could fucking learn something
by going and checking on all of that now.

34
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,280
Start with the kitchen, yeah?

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,440
Don't touch anything.

36
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,600
Amazing mentor you are.

37
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,440
I know. It's a gift.

38
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,440
You have one new message.

39
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,760
I know you're listening to these messages.

40
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,160
I know you're pretending
they don't bother you,

41
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,920
same as you pretend
you're a righteous person.

42
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,280
You're not a righteous person, Merritt.

43
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,240
You're a fucking selfish,
manipulative bitch,

44
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,520
and very soon, I'm gonna find you,

45
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,800
rip that black heart out of your chest,
and fucking feed it to you.

46
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,400
So enjoy your final moments.

47
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,640
So it was just a coincidence, then,

48
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,520
that on the day before she was planning
on moving into a new flat,

49
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,520
your wife, visibly upset,
ran out of a restaurant

50
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,040
in which the two of you
were previously seen arguing,

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,800
and when you got home,
she fell down the stairs

52
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,720
and suffered two hip fractures,

53
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,120
a broken wrist, multiple lacerations,

54
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,600
as well as the severe head trauma
which killed her.

55
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,480
Mr. Finch,

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,880
can you not see what we all clearly see?

57
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,760
That this woman clearly didn't fall.

58
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,200
She was pushed

59
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,960
by you.

60
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,080
After you and your wife fought at dinner,

61
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,400
when you discovered
she was planning to leave you,

62
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,840
you, to quote your own family,

63
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,640
flew off the handle,
and you pushed her down the stairs.

64
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,000
-I didn't push her down the stairs.
-Yes, you did.

65
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,400
I found her!

66
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,400
At the bottom of those stairs.

67
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
Dead.

68
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,800
All twisted up.

69
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,040
I can't close my eyes
without seeing her like that.

70
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,120
I did not kill my wife,

71
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,800
either on purpose or by accident.

72
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,960
I loved her.

73
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,120
And if she was unhappy with me,
with our marriage, as you now imply…

74
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,520
I had no idea.

75
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,280
My wife saved my life.

76
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,600
She made me a better person.

77
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Now…

78
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
I'm lost.

79
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,960
When the defense isn't objecting
to something they normally would,

80
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,720
one has to think it's a trap.

81
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,560
-Liam.
-But you plowed on.

82
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,360
Someone with more experience
might have understood.

83
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,720
What are you on about?

84
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,160
All that about Finch being so violent
he clearly threw his wife down the stairs.

85
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,680
His counsel just sat there, kept quiet.

86
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,840
Even Finch noticed.

87
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,920
Maybe he didn't object
because it's all relevant.

88
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,120
-Relevant and admissible are different.
-That depends on how one hears it.

89
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,000
All the jury heard
was that he loved his wife.

90
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,960
I was supposed to show you the ropes,
not help you hang yourself with them.

91
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,320
It's not your fault.

92
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Yeah, I know.

93
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,640
That was all a performance.
Finch was full of shite.

94
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,040
The man should win a fucking BAFTA.
Nearly had me in tears.

95
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,000
He's not wrong.

96
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,120
He's still raging
that you gave me this case and not him.

97
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
Well, maybe. But still.

98
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,600
You go too far sometimes.
And today was a perfect example.

99
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,000
What was I supposed to do?

100
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,360
You left me hanging.
You wouldn't let me use Kirsty's evidence.

101
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,520
She was not going to help you.
She would have made it worse, in fact.

102
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,760
-Well, without her, there was no evidence.
-There's plenty of evidence.

103
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,760
You had what you yourself described
as a slam-dunk case.

104
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,120
And then you proceeded to tell the jury
just how convinced you were

105
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
that the man in the box was a murderer.

106
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,520
Once the jury gets alone in a room,

107
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,440
the facts of the case
become the topic at hand,

108
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,120
not how badly the killer might feel
or how much love he had for his victim.

109
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,800
No one can say what a jury will do.

110
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,360
-I'm just saying they know he did it.
-Do they?

111
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,280
Or do you just expect them
to think you're right?

112
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,960
I was gonna ask you
to join me for a quick drink, but…

113
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,000
I think I just pissed on that idea.

114
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,400
Carl Morck?

115
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,440
Dr. Sonnenberg.

116
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,680
I'm Dr. Irving.

117
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,200
Dr. Sonnenberg broke her hip,
so I'm filling in.

118
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Pick one.

119
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,000
Dr. Sonnenberg break
her hip playing tennis, did she?

120
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,600
An incident in the garden
is what they told me.

121
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,560
Go ahead, try one.

122
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,160
I left my racket at home.

123
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,720
They're therapeutic.

124
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,320
You squeeze them. Calms you down.

125
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,360
-Does it work?
-Try it.

126
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,720
-Keep it.
-Thank you.

127
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,920
Aren't you supposed to ask me
some questions?

128
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,160
I can, or we can just keep sitting here.
It's your 50 minutes.

129
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,960
And I was all set to dive
into my unhappy childhood.

130
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,080
I'm much more interested
in your unhappy adulthood.

131
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,880
"How'd ya feel, Carl?"

132
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,680
More like, how does it feel
to get shot, Carl?

133
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,600
I've heard it described as feeling like
being stung by 100 bees in the same place.

134
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,040
If all the bees were on fire

135
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,120
and they were flying at your face
at twice the speed of sound,

136
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,360
you could describe it like that, sure.

137
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,200
You don't look like a shrink.

138
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,520
-You'd prefer I had a beard?
-It would give us something to talk about.

139
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,720
I'm sure we've already
got plenty to talk about.

140
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,720
I just don't understand
the necessity of all this. I really don't.

141
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,400
You're saying you don't want to be here?

142
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,280
It's okay. Neither do I.
It's a shitty job talking to you lot.

143
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,240
Doesn't sound like
you like your job very much.

144
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,920
Would you like talking to you?

145
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,240
Fair point.

146
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,800
All right.

147
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,200
I'm tired of
"What it feels like to get shot."

148
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,880
-Ask me another question.
-You give me permission?

149
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,040
Let's just see how it goes.

150
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,520
I see in your file
you're on an antidepressant.

151
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,920
-That's in my file?
-Among other things.

152
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,240
-Such as?
-I've only glanced at it.

153
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,560
Have you been feeling depressed, Carl?

154
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,720
No more than normal.

155
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,720
If I was shot in the face,
I might feel depressed.

156
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,840
-I might feel angry.
-Not me.

157
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,720
-So all good, then?
-From my end, yeah.

158
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,360
So no need for me to ask
about anxiety or sleep problems

159
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,000
because, of course,
you've experienced none of that.

160
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,240
-I don't sleep much anyway.
-Mm-hmm.

161
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,440
So, then, this is just
a giant waste of our time.

162
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,080
Well, those are your words, not mine.

163
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,400
Okay. I get your point
about talking to police officers.

164
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,280
Really? Just gonna eat that
in front of me?

165
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,440
It's normally my lunch hour,
but I wanted to fit you in.

166
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,760
Of course, that was before I heard
how well you were doing.

167
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,400
I said I got your point.

168
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,440
The truth is, Carl,
a computer could just as easily tell you

169
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,240
that after the incident in Leith Park,

170
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,160
you're gonna have problems
interacting with other human beings.

171
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,760
And at some point,
you might need some help.

172
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,560
I had problems with other human beings
long before I was shot.

173
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,720
Yeah.

174
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,400
The phrase "superiority complex"

175
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,880
seems to be the overall theme
of your personnel file.

176
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,280
-Is that the file you barely glanced at?
-I didn't say "barely."

177
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,920
Are you superior, Carl, to other people?

178
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,520
Well, it's a low bar, isn't it?

179
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Wow.

180
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,840
I will now read from a statement
written by Caroline Kerr, witness.

181
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,520
"On the morning of October 17th,

182
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,520
I was walking with my eight-month-old
through Leith Park

183
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,000
when I observed a man in dark clothing
go into the back door of flat number 226."

184
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,960
"Approximately five minutes later,
I saw the man exit the flat

185
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,720
and walk to a blue compact car
of a make I couldn't identify."

186
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,080
-This was your statement four months ago.
-I know.

187
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,280
But now I've had some time
to think about it,

188
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,960
I'm not sure it was the same flat.

189
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,120
You said in your statement
you were positive.

190
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,800
I think I made a mistake.

191
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,000
Caroline, a policeman is dead.

192
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,760
Another policeman's paralyzed.

193
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,280
And I'm very sorry.

194
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,280
If someone's threatened you,

195
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,760
told you to change your statement,
we can protect you.

196
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,280
No one's threatened me.
I thought I was sure, but I'm not.

197
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,560
-Caroline, you saw a man--
-No. I only thought I did.

198
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,560
I'm very sorry.

199
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,160
God, I don't think I'm ready
for you to be back so soon, Carl.

200
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,680
Hello, Rose.

201
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,240
-Your face isn't sagging.
-Excuse me?

202
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,880
Well, I thought one side of your face
would be all… saggy.

203
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,000
I didn't have a stroke. I was shot.

204
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,120
Hmm. Is there a scar or anything?

205
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,120
In there, out there.

206
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,560
Nice.

207
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,080
At least you don't need a wee helmet
like my nephew.

208
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,360
-Is she in?
-Do I look like a PA?

209
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,160
Yeah, you do.

210
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,560
Maybe you saw her leave,
perhaps heard where she was going.

211
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,640
Sorry.

212
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,600
Who's that?

213
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,600
Moira's stalker.

214
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:07,240
Nah, he's just after a job.
Brings me these if I let him sit there.

215
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,120
They're gonna rot your teeth.

216
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,360
Lovely to have you back, Carl.

217
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
See ya.

218
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,120
-Prick.
-Heard that.

219
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,440
Meant you to.

220
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,560
Oh, for fuck's sake!
This is why I wanted her out the press.

221
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,120
"Mother and baby in pushchair
witness murder."

222
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,280
We practically led them to her door.

223
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,240
She lives in the neighborhood.
It's possible they saw her at the scene.

224
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,600
Recognized her later on.

225
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,280
Well, she was your only witness.
So now what?

226
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,680
We just need time.

227
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,360
You've had four months.

228
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,720
And maybe some more manpower.

229
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,480
D.C.I. Morck's back today.

230
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,280
How could you not give us time to prepare?

231
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,120
There's no preparing for Carl.

232
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,680
Jesus, Carl!

233
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,200
You asked to see me.

234
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,400
An hour ago.

235
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,640
D.C.I. Bruce.

236
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,160
Carl. Welcome back.

237
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,600
Good to see ya. You look--

238
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,560
Like shite?

239
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,800
Not quite that good.

240
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,080
I'm sorry I didn't die, Logan.

241
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,240
I'll get over it.

242
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,000
-We really are glad to have you back.
-I assume by "we," you mean no one.

243
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,920
We should probably talk about Leith Park.

244
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,680
I know all about it. I was there.

245
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,840
-I meant the investigation.
-So did I.

246
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,640
I'm guessing nothing from the fragments
that came out of the wall,

247
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,080
no prints or DNA beyond those belonging
to me, D.I. Hardy, and Anderson,

248
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,640
no CCTV, and no cooperating witnesses.
Is that about right?

249
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,560
We had one until about five minutes ago.

250
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,680
Wow.

251
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,120
Keep up the good work.

252
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,040
The place had been wiped ahead of time.
It seemed pre-planned, organized by a pro.

253
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,160
-A pro wouldn't leave Hardy or me alive.
-Backup had arrived.

254
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,720
-How do you know?
-I was with 'em.

255
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,640
-Did you see the shooter?
-No.

256
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,640
Well, I'm back.

257
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,760
So I'll take Wilson and Clark
off your hands, and we'll just start over.

258
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,040
Get your own f--

259
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,280
Lovely to see you, Carl.

260
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
Sorry.

261
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,960
-You can't investigate your own shooting.
-I know. I just wanted to see his face.

262
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,360
Do you ever stop and wonder
why people hate you?

263
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,360
No.

264
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,280
Okay, so?

265
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,120
So it never crossed the line.

266
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,160
The referee gave it.

267
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,040
No, the linesman gave it.

268
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,640
Yeah, so it was a goal.

269
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,800
No, the linesman gave it
because he was Russian.

270
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,240
Why the fuck would he?

271
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,040
It was the Cold War.
The fucking Russians hated us.

272
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,320
I know, but they hated the Germans more.
We're talking 1966.

273
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,880
It was 20 years after the war. Also…

274
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,920
Also what?

275
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,080
Also, the Germans beat the Soviets
in the semi-final.

276
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,680
So the linesman had
a score to settle, didn't he?

277
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,120
Look, even if any of this Tartan Army
conspiracy bullshit was actually true,

278
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,880
which it's fucking not, it's irrelevant
because England scored again.

279
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,440
-We won 4-2. Bosh.
-Aye.

280
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,800
That's because the Germans
were pressing for an equalizer,

281
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,080
which they shouldn't have been

282
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,720
because your third goal
was never a goal in the first place.

283
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,040
-What the fuck do you think of that?
-Fucking get over it.

284
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,880
We won. Why can't you just let it go?

285
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,840
-Good morning, sirs.
-Hang on, mate.

286
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,160
It's the fucking attitude we hate.
Commentators banging on about 1966.

287
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,040
What you hate is the fact that England won

288
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,040
and you lot never will
'cause you're fucking shit.

289
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,960
You can't even qualify, let alone win.

290
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,080
Fucking Uruguay won it twice
before your lot did.

291
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,320
You don't see them acting all
Billy Big Baws about it 60 years later.

292
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,320
D.I. Hardy, D.C.I. Morck.

293
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,080
Anderson, sir. Where's the rest of you?

294
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,600
On the way, I'd imagine.
What are we looking at?

295
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,320
Dead male. Sixties, best I could tell.
I… I didn't get too close.

296
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,680
-How do you know he's dead?
-It's kind of obvious.

297
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,880
-Obvious?
-The smell, sir, and, um…

298
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,240
-I think you'll know when you see him.
-What brought you to the door?

299
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,440
Routine wellness.

300
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,480
Your man's daughter
in Lancaster called in.

301
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,080
Said her dad hadn't returned her calls
for a couple of days.

302
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,360
The door was open when I got here, so…

303
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,320
-Open or unlocked?
-Open.

304
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,000
-What do you think? Wait for the boys?
-So youse aren't the response unit?

305
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,440
We were nearby.
Thought we'd take a look. Is that okay?

306
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,480
Might as well do.

307
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,120
Body's in the chair.

308
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,280
Ch… Checked them?

309
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,000
Yes, checked them.

310
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,680
Are they open? Are they closed?
Are they locked? Are they broken?

311
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,680
Is there another door?
Ooh, does it look forced?

312
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,240
Fucking anything
apart from, "Ooh, it smells,"

313
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,960
which we kind of already know.

314
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,320
I was instructed to wait for the team.

315
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Either go back outside and wait
or learn something

316
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,240
and go and check all of that out now,
starting with the kitchen.

317
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
Sir.

318
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,520
Don't touch anything.

319
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,880
Amazing mentor you are.

320
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,720
I know. It's a gift.

321
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,280
Anderson, sir.

322
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,720
How long you been on the job? A month?

323
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,960
Three, sir.

324
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,080
Tell you what,
there's nothing like a bit of a shoot-out

325
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,880
to age the fuck out of you.

326
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,520
A total fucking cock-up.

327
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,200
I mean, first, they roll up on a scene
that's not even theirs.

328
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,200
Then they march
straight into a fucking ambush.

329
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,320
Real question is why they decided
to show up in the first place.

330
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,280
Because Morck can't fucking help himself.

331
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,360
Has--

332
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,080
Is this the car?

333
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,920
Simple yes or no.

334
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,320
Is this the car the witness said
she saw the shooter get out of?

335
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,720
Yes, but she's not a witness anymore.

336
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,160
-She recanted, but she's still a witness.
-Can't use her. Not in court.

337
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,840
We're not the fucking courts, are we?

338
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,800
-What's this here?
-What's what where?

339
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,720
Where's the nearest McDonald's?

340
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,280
There's one by the station.

341
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,040
Not here.

342
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,560
Near fucking Leith Park.

343
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,280
There's one on Market Road.

344
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,120
Did you check the CCTV there?

345
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,680
Okay. Come here.

346
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,560
What does this look like?

347
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,200
-That could be anyone's.
-Yeah, could be.

348
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,160
Well, it wasn't listed by forensics.

349
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,120
Well, that's two fuckups, then.

350
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,480
What else do you see? What about you?

351
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,920
The bag and the cup. They weren't there
before the car got there.

352
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,320
It'd be good to see
if the CCTV at the McDonald's caught

353
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,640
a guy dressed all in black
buying a milkshake, no?

354
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,080
Why would the shooter leave the scene
then come back?

355
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,640
Wrong question. Why did he stay?

356
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,600
The shooter was watching the house
to see who showed up.

357
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,840
-How do you know that?
-Because what other explanation is there?

358
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,520
Our theory is
that these are two separate crimes.

359
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,920
One shooting, one stabbing.

360
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,560
-I'm not sure that's the theory to pursue.
-Why not?

361
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,840
Because that means
that's two separate crimes

362
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,960
you've gotten fucking nowhere with.

363
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,200
Focus on the shooter.

364
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,600
Focus on what the fuck
he actually did that day.

365
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,400
You've got it all up here.

366
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,960
And check the CCTV at the McDonald's.

367
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,360
Please.

368
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,920
Homicide rates are up.

369
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,960
Holyrood is accusing us
of letting too much slip through the net.

370
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,040
I suppose, maybe, we should work
a little harder at solving crimes.

371
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,280
I'll get right on that.

372
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,080
-Anything else?
-Moira--

373
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,160
Seriously, Jonathan? Et tu?

374
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,280
No one's accusing you of anything.
We're just having a conversation.

375
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,280
One that began with, "So, Moira, tell us,
what's up with your miserable solve rate?"

376
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,840
You disagree with the numbers?

377
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:46,560
Not at all, but we have MITs
working without crime scene officers.

378
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,600
Two forensic experts
across a whole department.

379
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,640
I'm aware of the financial issues.

380
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,080
But there's some concern
about public perception.

381
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,920
Perception is neither my problem
nor my department.

382
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,320
Figuring out how to spend
what money I don't have

383
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,240
on actual investigations is.

384
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,200
I'm assuming you know about
the Windley case up in Aberdeen.

385
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,360
All I know is what I've read.

386
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,360
Some police officer,
retired now, who never let it go.

387
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,960
Sixteen years without a solve

388
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,920
until they get a DNA hit
from a trace off her clothes.

389
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,840
Can't wait for the podcast.

390
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,040
Exactly. That was good optics.

391
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,440
Killer's been put away years after
they thought they'd gotten away.

392
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,840
Personally, I think it's better
we put them away sooner.

393
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,640
The cabinet secretary is proposing
we establish a new department.

394
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,160
One that's focused
on examining similar cases

395
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,480
which might serve the public's interest.

396
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,200
Doesn't the solving of every case
serve the public interest?

397
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,520
You're a good officer, Moira,

398
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,240
but sometimes you forget
the wider picture.

399
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,840
Look, I need to be solving
the cases on my desk yesterday,

400
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,880
not ones from before I was born.

401
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,080
I've barely got enough detectives
to cover the ground as it is,

402
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,400
let alone a new department.

403
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,400
I should mention
the department will have its own budget.

404
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,080
What sort of budget?

405
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,080
A substantial one.

406
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,560
Depending on the cases you choose.
Bigger profile the better.

407
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,240
The Crown Office has put together
a list of cases to consider.

408
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,320
And, of course,
you'd have an advocate at your disposal.

409
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,960
I'll have full discretion over all of it,
cases and budget?

410
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,400
It's your department.

411
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,720
I suppose I could make that work.

412
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,360
Good.

413
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,040
Now, who do you have in mind for the job?

414
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,480
Only me.

415
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,680
I went back today.

416
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,640
Nothing's changed. All fucking morons.

417
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,000
I think I'm just gonna put my time in
and be done with it.

418
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,800
And then, who knows?
Maybe I'll just hang out with you.

419
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,800
Argue about football.

420
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,280
Smells good.

421
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,000
It's nearly done.

422
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,840
It's been a long day, I'm sure.

423
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,040
I'll take it from here.

424
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,240
I firmly believe
that those who commit violent crime

425
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,080
don't ever truly get away with it.

426
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,680
Um, the court might set them free,

427
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,960
but be it conscience,
karma, or the universe,

428
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,320
they are, ultimately, one way or another,
punished for what they've done.

429
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,880
That was Merritt Lingard,

430
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,600
the lead prosecutor
in the Graham Finch trial,

431
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,640
which reaches its conclusion…

432
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,040
You're not gonna make me
watch that nonsense, are you?

433
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,040
Oh, I see.

434
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,560
Your choice.

435
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,680
As long as it's got nothing
to do with criminals or courts.

436
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,960
Oh, blow ye winds over the ocean

437
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,280
Oh, blow ye winds over the sea

438
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,400
Oh, blow ye winds over the ocean

439
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,880
And bring back my Bonnie to me

440
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,280
You're still here.

441
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,840
Oh, it was no trouble. He's all set now.

442
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,160
That's very nice of you.

443
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,240
-I'll just get my coat.
-My brother is a grown man.

444
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,760
He's not a child.

445
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,680
Of course.

446
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,720
I'm saying that he's not your baby boy.

447
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,960
-I know.
-What?

448
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,800
I know he's not my baby boy.

449
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,680
Then treat him as such.

450
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,360
Yeah.

451
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Martin!

452
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,680
-I don't know what you expect from me.
-Could you turn it down?

453
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,720
I could, yes.
You need to talk to him first.

454
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,120
I don't pay £500 a month
to have my ears bled out.

455
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,720
-It's bad enough he eats all my food.
-I can't hear you.

456
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,160
I'm serious. I get that he hates you.
Has he really gotta take it out on me?

457
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,280
I'm trying to work in here.

458
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,320
Work? Oh, you got a job, then?

459
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,600
Can't hear you.

460
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,760
-What the fuck?
-The house is on fire.

461
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,880
-Fuck off. I'd smell the smoke.
-This room is disgusting.

462
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,240
So what? I mean, this whole place,
it's just a dump.

463
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,560
You could get off your arse
once in a while and clean it

464
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,680
because Martin is not
a parlor maid, you know?

465
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,960
Yeah, well, I've got homework, so…

466
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,920
Biology?

467
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,480
Turn it down,

468
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,000
or I will throw everything in this room
out of the fucking window.

469
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,960
You're a prick.

470
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,560
So I keep hearing.

471
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,200
-Good morning, madam.
-Who are you?

472
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,240
Uh, I'm Akram Salim.
I've been waiting to see you.

473
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,800
And the wait continues. I'm very busy.

474
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,760
Yes, I work part-time in admin, mostly IT,

475
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,480
but I was hoping
I might move into your department.

476
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,160
-Uh, I have experience back home in Syria.
-Speak to recruitment.

477
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,880
Yes. They say nothing is available,
but if you just give me a moment--

478
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,240
I'm afraid there's no path
for you here, then.

479
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,160
How did he get in here?

480
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,920
-Um…
-Is that a pass I see?

481
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,280
No, he just, um…

482
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,160
He works in IT. He's not allowed
in this part of the building.

483
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,240
If you try these, you'll understand.

484
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,480
Get rid of him.

485
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,760
You're a cop.

486
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,640
Who says?

487
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,000
That thing round your neck.
Have you shot anyone?

488
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,080
Not today.

489
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,520
Have you seen dead bodies?

490
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,000
A few.

491
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,440
-I saw my granda dead.
-Yeah?

492
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,040
He pished himself.

493
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,280
You didn't kill him, did you?

494
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,200
Nah. My mum said it was
all the Tennent's and crisps that got him.

495
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,640
Well, that's not a bad way to go.

496
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,960
Whoa. My own department?

497
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,440
Congratulations.

498
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,600
Are you joking?

499
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,280
It's been commissioned
by the cabinet secretary himself.

500
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,680
-Really?
-Yeah.

501
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,800
You'll be reviewing cold cases
from all over the country.

502
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,360
There's a list here from the Crown Office.

503
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,120
You can pick whichever ones you want.

504
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,680
And you'd have your own contact there,
if you'd like.

505
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,040
Contact? What, some lawyer?

506
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,280
If you'd like.

507
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,760
Who exactly will I be in charge of?

508
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,520
Just you.

509
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,200
A department of just me?

510
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,160
Oh, you'll have an office,
whatever resources you need.

511
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,400
Well, I'll need a car.

512
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,360
No, we can't just give you a car.
This isn't The Price is Right.

513
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,880
You just said I'd be reviewing cases
all over the country.

514
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,960
What happens if I get one in Inverness?
Do you expect me to take a bus?

515
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,440
I'll see what I can do.

516
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,720
So can I tell the deputy chief constable
that you're on board?

517
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,400
Where's this office?

518
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,360
Q? Where the hell's that?

519
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,920
Downstairs.

520
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,200
The offices are numbered
downstairs, Moira.

521
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,360
I meant, downstairs downstairs.

522
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,920
Fucking hell.

523
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,720
Jesus.

524
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,040
Yeah.

525
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,080
This'll do.

526
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,440
I can't let you in here anymore.
Boss's orders.

527
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,440
Turns out she doesn't have
much of a sweet tooth.

528
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,080
Those were amazing.

529
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,000
My wife's special recipe.

530
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,440
She would be pleased
to know you like them.

531
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,720
And thank you for your hospitality.

532
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,280
Oh, um, I'm gonna need that, um…

533
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,520
-Oh, right.
-…pass. Yeah.

534
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
Thanks.

535
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,640
Good luck.

536
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,080
Fuck, Rose!

537
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,320
Chief wanted me to tell you

538
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,240
she looks forward to hearing
which one you pick first.

539
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,080
Oh, great.

540
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,680
What you working on?

541
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,440
I was working on taking a fucking nap.

542
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,640
Yeah, you're probably gonna need
someone's help getting through all these.

543
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,480
You're absolutely right.

544
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,920
Uh, that's not what I…

545
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,720
Fuck.

546
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,720
I want one new computer
and one new telephone on every desk.

547
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,600
And put your old telephones
into this wee bin here.

548
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,640
All right?

549
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,240
Uh, Moira?

550
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,120
Hi! Oh.

551
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,400
-Fuck's sake.
-Hi.

552
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,640
You can't expect me
to go through those files on my own.

553
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,080
You only have to choose one.

554
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,280
There's decades' worth
of evidence down there. I'd need a team.

555
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:39,200
I thought you understood it was just you.
You're more than capable.

556
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,440
Uh, that big telly, into my office,
and the chair, behind my desk.

557
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,280
We're just, uh, moving things around.

558
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,880
I thought you said the cabinet secretary
requested this department.

559
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,360
That the reputation of the entire force
was on the line.

560
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,200
Well, I think that's overstating.

561
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,680
Oh, well, let's invite him down
to my office, shall we?

562
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,040
We can all sit on the urinals
and talk it out.

563
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,600
Fine. I'll find you an assistant
to lighten the load, okay?

564
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,360
Mm-hmm. Oh, and by the way,
it was never meant to be an office,

565
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,880
so anything you could do
on the refurbishment budget.

566
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,720
-You know, if there's anything left.
-Don't push your luck.

567
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,920
And I want the first case
for the end of the week.

568
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Yeah, yeah.

569
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,000
In the High Court of Justiciary,
court number six,

570
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,240
Her Majesty's advocate
against Graham Finch.

571
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,360
Would the spokesperson of the jury
please rise?

572
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,000
Have you reached your verdict?

573
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,080
We have.

574
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,880
And what is your verdict
under the charge of murder?

575
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,560
We find the charge not proven.

576
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,480
Mr. Finch…

577
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:52,680
you have been acquitted by the jury
and are now discharged from the dock.

578
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,920
Court.

579
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,080
Ladies and gentlemen, if I may.

580
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,240
This has obviously been
a very emotive case for all concerned.

581
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,200
The Crown wishes
it had gone in a different direction,

582
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,280
and we will now consider our options
moving forward.

583
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,240
-Go.
-Where?

584
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,280
Anywhere. Just go.

585
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:28,960
Hello?

586
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,360
Sir?

587
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,680
Okay. Push, push!

588
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,080
Oh, sorry.

589
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,640
Who are you?

590
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:57,600
I have been sent from upstairs.
I'm your new assistant.

591
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,480
Akram Salim.

592
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,000
D.C. Dixon.

593
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,000
Why do I feel like
I've got you to thank for this?

594
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,680
I take it you've met Akram.

595
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,000
Is this some kind of sick joke, yeah?

596
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,400
He's very, um… eager.

597
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,240
Yeah, which is code for pain in the arse.

598
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,080
Oh, you two should get along
wonderfully, then.

599
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,680
Oh, you have…

600
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,360
-Akram, yeah?
-Yes, sir.

601
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:36,680
It's Carl. Not "sir."
I'm very busy. There's a lot to be done.

602
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,320
That's why I'm here, sir. Carl.

603
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,560
Good. Okay. There's a mop and bucket
in the other room. This place is a mess.

604
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,400
Then I want you to go upstairs
and get me a…

605
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,680
a computer and one of those new TVs, yeah?

606
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,200
That's everything?

607
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,800
For now.

608
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,040
D.C.I. Morck.

609
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,760
Hey. It's me.

610
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,000
They said you fell out of bed.
Found you on the floor by the window.

611
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,800
Don't you know
that Scottish air will kill you?

612
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,480
-Fuck off.
-Please, mate.

613
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,400
Fuck's sake, please.

614
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,920
Look, we'll figure it out, okay?
Like we always do together. I promise.

615
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,480
Is that Carl Morck?

616
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,520
Hey.

617
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,640
-Dad.
-Hey!

618
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:05,960
Hello.

619
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,720
Hello?

620
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,480
Claire?

621
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,200
Claire? What's…?

622
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,360
I've been trying to call you. You're late.

623
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,800
William.

624
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,560
Can I see?

625
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,000
No. It's okay. Gentle, gentle, gentle.

626
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,560
What's that? Dad's boat?

627
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:18,080
I don't know about you, but I am so tired.

628
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,120
So maybe we should get away
for a little while.

629
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,800
Change of scenery. What do you think?

630
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,920
I'm sorry I wasn't here.

631
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,360
Oi! What the fuck are you doing?

632
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,240
Oh.

633
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,320
I'm sorry, sir.
I just wanted to understand what you do.

634
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,880
Those are confidential.

635
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,160
Well, upstairs they say
it's a new department, but no one told me.

636
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,160
But now I read them, I understand.

637
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,480
-You read them?
-Yes.

638
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,320
-What, all of them?
-Many of them.

639
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,560
Very interesting cases.
Murders, kidnappings, rapes, assaults.

640
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,960
-I think many are good mysteries.
-"Good."

641
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,480
Worthy.

642
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,800
At home in Syria,
there are a lot of cases like this.

643
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,520
Unsolved. People go missing.
No one knows anything about it.

644
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,400
Most of the time,
I was the only one looking.

645
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,360
-What, you worked for the police?
-Sort of.

646
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,640
Sort of?

647
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,000
Well, it's, uh…

648
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,920
it's complicated.

649
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,800
You will solve them, these cases?

650
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,080
Who knows?

651
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:58,080
-Which will you work on?
-I don't know. I'm supposed to choose one.

652
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,800
There are many that can be solved.

653
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,920
And you know that just from what?
Just reading them, yeah?

654
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,360
Don't you, when you read a file?

655
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,440
Sometimes you're able to just know.

656
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,200
I haven't read 'em.

657
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,760
Perhaps, then, I could assist you.
Read through all of them.

658
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,360
It's not your job, is it?

659
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,840
Put 'em away.

660
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,600
Look.

661
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,120
Since you can actually read a file,

662
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,800
and clearly a fuck sight better
than you mop the floor,

663
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,680
maybe you could sort them out for me.

664
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,080
Yeah? Categorize them. We'll call it…

665
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,440
administrative work.

666
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,680
-I can do that.
-Great.

667
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,400
Oh, uh…

668
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,800
The boss said you are to park in the back,

669
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,840
not in the disabled space.

670
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,520
Apparently, I'm to solve
some fancy cold case of my own choosing,

671
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,640
as long as it makes Moira look good,
which, of course, is bullshit

672
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,000
because she'll spend it
on her own fucking unit.

673
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,720
Look at us, fuck's sake.

674
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,560
You wanna kill yourself.
I wanna kill everyone else.

675
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,960
Talk about one and one
equals fucking zero.

676
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,520
We need to figure something out,
together and soon.

677
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,480
Because, as much as I'd love to,
I can't give up on Jasper.

678
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,960
I sure as fuck can't give up on you.

679
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,000
So outside of me putting a pillow
over your face, I don't know what we do.

680
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,200
You can give me one of those beers…

681
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,000
and tell me more
about this new department.

682
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,360
No!

683
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,800
William, no.
You can't have it back. It's gone.

684
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,120
It's gone. You can't have it back.

685
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,880
William! You can't have it back.

686
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,720
You shouldn't have done it, then.

687
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,080
We can find her.

688
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,880
She's gone four years now.

689
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:15,960
So?

690
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:20,720
She's dead.

691
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,360
I don't think so.

692
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,880
That what your gut tells you?

693
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,080
It's what the file tells me.

694
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,320
Nah, it's a loser.

695
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,480
Good morning, Merritt.
