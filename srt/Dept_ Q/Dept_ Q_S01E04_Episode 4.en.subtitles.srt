1
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,800
Merritt?

2
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,400
Hello?

3
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,200
Merritt Lingard, is that you?

4
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,800
Did you just--

5
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,920
Hello?

6
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,480
Hey!

7
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm talking to you!

8
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,640
I'm an officer of the court.
Do you know what that means?

9
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,600
It means that

10
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,600
every police officer in the country
is gonna be out there

11
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,800
looking for me right now.

12
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,920
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,480
Where's my brother?

14
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,680
Is my brother here?

15
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,440
Have you got my brother?

16
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,160
I swear to God, if you fucking touch him--

17
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,720
100% it gets under my skin. 100%.

18
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,240
But more than that, you know what?
It just… It confuses me.

19
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,480
"Tatty-byes." What the fuck?

20
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,000
It's just goodbye, Carl.

21
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,680
It's not. No, no, no.
"Tatties" are potatoes.

22
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,000
What the fuck do potatoes have to do
with saying goodbye?

23
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,000
Potatoes are a fucking foodstuff.

24
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,040
What the fuck do Cheerios have to do
with saying goodbye?

25
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,640
Cheerios are a fucking breakfast cereal.

26
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,160
You're being facetious. Yay.

27
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,880
No, I'm just trying to find a plumber.
Do you have any recommendations?

28
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,520
Not my area of expertise.

29
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,160
Mine either, hence the need
to look up an actual expert.

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You hate Scotland so much.
Why'd you ever move here?

31
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,400
I married into it.

32
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,640
Well, now you can leave, finally.

33
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,400
Give us our fucking independence.

34
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,960
How is it you're supposed
to actually be helping me, huh?

35
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,680
If your dishwasher breaks,
you call in a plumber.

36
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,960
In this scenario, Carl, I'm your plumber.

37
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,000
Half of my life is spent

38
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,120
with gross incompetence
left, right, and center,

39
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,240
and the other half
with an ill-tempered, jizzed-up teenager.

40
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,560
He's not even mine. He's not even mine.

41
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,800
I somehow won him
in the great coconut shy of divorce,

42
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,000
along with some silverware,
which needs an awful lot less polishing.

43
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,800
-I didn't know you had a son.
-Stepson.

44
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,800
You share custody?

45
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,960
Oh, no, no. Lucky me.
I get Jasper all to myself.

46
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,920
He's not with his mother?

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Victoria travels a lot with work,

48
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,520
and she thought it'd be better
for Jasper to have a…

49
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,640
strong male figure in his life
at this, as she puts it,

50
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,040
crucial juncture in his development.

51
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,200
Wow.

52
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,920
I have to say, Carl, I'm surprised.

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,400
-At?
-The reason you haven't left.

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,360
That's a massive commitment
you signed on for.

55
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,080
Don't worry. I fought her on it.

56
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,200
There he is.

57
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,480
The time came to take him
to his grandmother's house. I was like,

58
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,480
"Mm."

59
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,600
And I couldn't leave him there.
Couldn't do it.

60
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,240
-Because you care about him.
-No.

61
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,240
Because I fucking hate that old bitch.

62
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,240
How old's Jasper?

63
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,400
Seventeen.

64
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,480
"Fuck you. Tuck me in."

65
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,520
Excuse me?

66
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Teenagers.

67
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,520
They need to hate you,
so they can leave when the time comes,

68
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,560
but they don't want to go,
so they drive everybody nuts.

69
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,280
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that Jasper's not that conflicted.

70
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,680
You've got a lot going on
in your life right now, Carl.

71
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,280
Yeah, yeah,
you could say that, Rachel. Yeah, yeah.

72
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,280
It's no wonder
you went doolally on live TV.

73
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,800
But… that's our time for today.

74
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Wow.

75
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,360
-I feel like we made a real breakthrough.
-Uh-huh.

76
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,040
Tatty-bye, Carl.

77
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,680
Cheerio, Rachel.

78
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,000
We need to revisit the crime scene,
do another walkthrough.

79
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,880
There must be something we've missed.

80
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,000
And while you're at it,
have another chat with the neighbors.

81
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,360
They must remember something.

82
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,000
You can't be here.

83
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,320
-How long's it been now? Four months?
-I can't discuss the case with you.

84
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,960
It's called professional courtesy,
even if only one of us is a professional.

85
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,480
And only one of us is actually courteous.

86
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Touché.

87
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,840
I'm gonna have Moira move the team
to somewhere you can't find us.

88
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,040
Oh, good luck in this fucking Nazi castle.

89
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,880
I tell you what,
why don't we actually trade?

90
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,240
You take our primo spot
down in the changing dungeon,

91
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,120
and we come up here into the light.

92
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,520
Keep it up, Carl,
and, uh, one might get the idea

93
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,640
you're trying to sabotage
the investigation.

94
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,240
I'm actually trying to help you.

95
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,920
It's just you are
too fucking insecure to accept it.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,360
Why not just, uh, tell me what you think
instead of being your usual chesty prick?

97
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,360
Shooter was waiting inside for us
when we got there.

98
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,840
You told DC Wilson and DC Clark
that the shooter had been waiting outside.

99
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,520
-I told them someone was waiting outside.
-You used the word "shooter."

100
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,040
We would have heard or seen
someone come inside.

101
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,160
Not if they came in through the back door.

102
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,440
Especially if they came in
through the back door.

103
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,320
There were bins piled up in front of it.

104
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,720
Why would anyone do that?

105
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,880
Because most of the people in those flats
use that space as another room.

106
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,120
Inside, there was a chair
in front of the door,

107
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,600
meaning that anyone coming in
would have to move the bins,

108
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,400
then open the door,
and then move the chair.

109
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,920
All of which, what?
Without us hearing them?

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,560
But the chair was moved aside,
and the bins were knocked over.

111
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,400
Neither was the case
when Hardy and I arrived.

112
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,880
I clocked the bins, the chair.
Why? It's part of the job.

113
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,320
Now, the dead man had been
in there for a while.

114
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,120
The daughter said she hadn't heard
from him for a few days, yeah?

115
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,000
So… someone sat there
in the house overnight,

116
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,080
waiting for… what?

117
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,160
I don't know.

118
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,640
I'm merely pointing out someone went out,
not in, the back door after the shooting.

119
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,080
Also, CCTV shows a guy in McDonald's

120
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,120
roughly around about 25 minutes
before the shooting starts, yeah?

121
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,400
He obviously left, then came back
before you arrived.

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,240
-Why?
-According to you, he got thirsty.

123
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,120
Cup was over there,
where the Ford was parked,

124
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,680
indicating that he ate his chips
and drank his McFlurry over there.

125
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,560
So depending on how fast
he did his eating,

126
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,800
that's ten minutes or so
before he went into the flat.

127
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,360
He could have got back in time
to reenter the flat before you arrived.

128
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,600
It's a short drive.

129
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,440
It better be a very short drive

130
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,200
because the CCTV puts
a guy in a hoodie dressed in black

131
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,960
in the McDonald's at just after 10:15.

132
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,840
He's in there for 12 minutes,
which takes us to 10:30.

133
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,760
PC Anderson's bodycam puts
the shooting exactly eight minutes later.

134
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,360
So that's eight minutes
to drive back to Leith Park,

135
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,040
eat, drink, beat us to the flat,
get into the flat, and then shoot us.

136
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,720
In fact, it is less than eight minutes,
because PC Anderson arrived before that.

137
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,840
Then you negate your argument

138
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,640
that the shooter was already inside
before you and Hardy arrived.

139
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,880
Your witness…

140
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,000
said she saw someone get into the Ford

141
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,720
immediately after the shooting
and drive away.

142
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,280
Former witness, but yes.

143
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,040
Towards which direction
did she say the car drove away?

144
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,480
Towards the football pitch.

145
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,320
And on which side of the car
did she say the person got in?

146
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,240
She didn't.

147
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,600
Maybe go back and ask her, yeah?

148
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
Bloody hell.

149
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,240
There were two of them.

150
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,240
Oh, aye?

151
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,760
Hardy.

152
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,640
I, uh,

153
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,320
brought you a…

154
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,960
For fuck's sake, Rose, stop your greeting.
You're making me feel worse.

155
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,680
Thank you.

156
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,400
So what's going on?
How's Carl treating you?

157
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,440
-He barely notices me.
-Doubt that.

158
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,480
Gives Akram all the good stuff.

159
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,600
-Gives me all the shite work.
-Such as?

160
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,640
I'm on my way out to Mhòr
to look at William Lingard's attack,

161
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,400
but I think he just wants to keep me away
from the investigation.

162
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,120
Why would he want to keep you away?

163
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,560
-I blackmailed him into bringing me on.
-No one can blackmail Carl.

164
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,280
-Why not?
-'Cause he doesn't give a shit.

165
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,440
Trust me on this.

166
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,720
If he didn't want you there,
you wouldn't be there.

167
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,760
So what's your plan for Mhòr?

168
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,720
I'm, uh, taking the ferry.

169
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,280
Not how you're getting there.
What the fuck you gonna do there?

170
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, um… I, uh…

171
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,000
thought I'd, uh, first speak
to the constable, get his perspective.

172
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,480
His perspective means fuck all.
It's only your perspective that matters.

173
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,640
-What's my perspective?
-Exactly.

174
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,240
Go see the constable,
but only to tell him you're on the job.

175
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,600
And if he can help with a file or a map.
Something you don't really need.

176
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,560
Just make him feel like he matters.
That way, he leaves you alone.

177
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,720
Okay, um… And then I can go
and visit the crime scene?

178
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,240
Sixteen years past? Waste of time.

179
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,960
-Not even to get a feel of it?
-A feel?

180
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,480
All you're gonna feel is,
"Okay, so this is where it happened."

181
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,600
So…

182
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,200
They had somebody right for it,
didn't they?

183
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,880
He died trying to get away.
Henry something.

184
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,880
Harry Jennings.

185
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,760
-Harry Jennings. Start there.
-With the dead guy?

186
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,400
With the dead guy. With his family,
his friends, his fucking goldfish.

187
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,720
You're looking for connections.

188
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,640
This was nearly 20 years ago.
It's probably nothing to do with Harry.

189
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,080
Probably not,
but every spoke leads you back to the hub,

190
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,920
so pick one and make it your own.

191
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,600
-Carl tell you that?
-Nero Wolfe.

192
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,920
Whoever the fuck that is.

193
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,920
What spoke are you gonna follow?

194
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,560
-What happened after the disappearance.
-We don't know what happened.

195
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,720
We don't know what happened to Merritt,
but she existed in the world.

196
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,240
She caused ripples
with people, institutions, things,

197
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,480
and these ripples, in turn,
caused patterns in her life.

198
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,920
It can be useful to see
if these patterns change

199
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,760
after one ceases to exist.

200
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,160
Hmm. Nero Wolfe again?

201
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,400
That one was Carl.

202
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,240
But that would assume
it was somebody in her life that took her.

203
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,800
It's a fucking guess, aye.

204
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,160
But that's what we start with, isn't it?
Guesses.

205
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,040
We just happen to call them theories.

206
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,120
Mm.

207
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,600
So there the guy is,
sitting in the pub, stark naked,

208
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,920
pint in front of him,
just waiting on me to arrest him.

209
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,040
God, you must have so many great stories.

210
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,040
Too many, yeah.

211
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,040
Go on.

212
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,600
That's the Royal Regiment
of Scotland's 4th Battalion.

213
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,440
-Yeah, the Highlanders.
-You know military history?

214
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,120
Well, I know the Highlanders descended

215
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,840
from the Seaforths,
the Camerons, and the Gordons.

216
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,800
Aye, well, there they all are. Look.

217
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,600
-Can I?
-Aye, course.

218
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,800
God, they're beautiful.
Where'd you get them?

219
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
I made them.

220
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,240
-No, you did not.
-Aye, I did.

221
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,600
Well, they are beautiful.

222
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,920
Oh, wow.

223
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,600
How does an arsehole
like you have for a boss

224
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,560
recruit someone as lovely as you, eh?

225
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,400
I'm not so lovely.

226
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,840
I've a dark soul.

227
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,960
-I bet you do.
-Mm.

228
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,280
-Multiple personalities.
-Even better.

229
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,840
I could use more than one of you.

230
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,800
Unlike the nitwits I've got here.

231
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,880
That's Colin, my eldest.

232
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,680
Nothing more moving
than the love between a father and son.

233
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,200
If you say so.

234
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,680
Uh, so there's eight of you
on the force over here?

235
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,840
Aye, two of them are part-time though.

236
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,080
-Don't suppose there's much crime?
-The odd pub fight. Public intoxication.

237
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,640
It's an island after all.
You rob the bank, where are you gonna go?

238
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,680
So, say, someone breaking into a house
to steal this or that

239
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,080
and beating someone to a pulp,
that would be unusual.

240
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
Very.

241
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,920
Not to mention the suspect getting killed
making his escape.

242
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,400
Talking about the Lingards here?

243
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,640
Well, actually, I'm more interested
in the suspect, Harry Jennings,

244
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,360
the boy who almost beat
William Lingard to death.

245
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
I know who you mean.

246
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,600
The other robberies that month.

247
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,760
-There was no violence involved.
-None.

248
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,320
Did you consider, then,
that Harry wasn't involved in the others?

249
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,920
Of course I did, but there was
no one home during the other burglaries.

250
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,480
And… as soon as he was of age,

251
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,840
I was pulling that lad off other boys
in the pub at least once a week.

252
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,880
He had what I would call a foul temper.

253
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,600
Harry was easy to piss off, then?

254
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,240
The lad was born pissed off.
He came out of his mother pre-enraged.

255
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,040
So it was just bad luck, then,
that William was home.

256
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,760
Aye, and that's all it was. Very bad luck.

257
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,440
And Merritt left right after that?

258
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,760
She got on the heli to hospital
with her brother and didn't come back.

259
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,480
She came back one time. For the funeral.

260
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,480
Aye, yeah, for once you're right.
She did come back for the funeral.

261
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,040
Wait.

262
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,880
She came back for the funeral of the boy
who almost beat her own brother to death?

263
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,880
Harry and Merritt were close.

264
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,440
Well, if they were so close,
why would he rob her house?

265
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,040
'Cause the family were desperate.

266
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,320
Clive Jennings's business had gone bust
the year before.

267
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,680
-Can I talk to Clive?
-Aye, if you're clairvoyant.

268
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,640
He died, what, six years ago?

269
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,480
-And the mum, Ailsa?
-You do do your homework, don't you?

270
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,440
You sure you don't wanna come
and work for me? You could train Colin up.

271
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,080
Maybe marry him, set him straight.

272
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,480
Aw, no. He's too handsome.
I'd be distracted.

273
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,520
Aye, Ailsa's still with us,
but she's not a very social person.

274
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,720
Can always knock on her door,
see what happens.

275
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,000
-Colin will show you the way.
-I can find it.

276
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,080
All the same,

277
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,560
Colin will take you.

278
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,600
-You really ate his lunch in there.
-Wasn't that hard.

279
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,000
Your mates, you know,
the ones that came over last time,

280
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,640
they give you the heads-up
on the old toy soldiers?

281
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,440
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I just love men in uniform.

282
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,360
Oh!

283
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,320
Really think I'm handsome, do you?

284
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,480
Uh, yeah.

285
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,600
Yeah, you're like
a young, gay Ralph Fiennes.

286
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,680
Oh.

287
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,720
Caught the "straighten him out" line.
That's good.

288
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,640
Again, it wasn't hard.

289
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,600
One of these days, I'm gonna leave.

290
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,000
Can't say I blame you.

291
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,640
You may have noticed that talk
of the Lingards and the Jennings

292
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,360
is a bit of a sore subject
for the constable.

293
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,000
-You call your dad "the constable"?
-I sure as fuck don't call him "Da."

294
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,600
Have you seen the crime scene photos?
Of the break-in?

295
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,880
Uh, yeah, yeah. I've looked at them.
Why? What about them?

296
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,480
After your boss requested the case files,

297
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,480
the constable went
and dug them out the archives,

298
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,520
and he stayed in the office all night
reading them.

299
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,960
Yeah, Carl has a brilliant way
of motivating people.

300
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,280
This was more than motivated.
I mean, he was upset.

301
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,520
So I went and had
a wee look at the files myself.

302
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,160
Little devil.

303
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,600
And?

304
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,400
I'd never read them before,
'cause I was just a kid then,

305
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,120
but, man, it was… it was brutal.

306
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,560
Like… the crime scene photos
made me sick to my stomach.

307
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,720
Harry pretty much caved in
William's skull.

308
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,160
Mm. Gave him brain damage.

309
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,320
Ugh. So there was this tech photo
of the room that they found William in,

310
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,120
but someone

311
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,960
had, uh, circled something that was lying
on the floor with a black marker.

312
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,520
Circled what?

313
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,960
A necklace.

314
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,760
Any idea why it was circled?

315
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,320
No.

316
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,640
And you think your dad
was the one who circled it?

317
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,600
Well, I… couldn't possibly say.

318
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
Could you, um,

319
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,040
could you scan the photo?

320
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,040
Ah. Yeah, I could.

321
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,960
Might make the constable look bad.

322
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,800
Or maybe that's the idea.

323
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,760
Um, exactly what kind
of hazardous waste are we talking about?

324
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,320
Oh, um,

325
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
asbestos?

326
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,840
Uranium, maybe?
I've never really thought about it.

327
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,600
-Nothing to worry about.
-Yeah.

328
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,880
This place used to be full of men, 24-7.

329
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,080
What was Jennings' business?

330
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,400
You name it, Clive Jennings fixed it.

331
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,480
Or painted it or scrapped it.

332
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,400
That's the old Jennings abode over there.

333
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,000
How did it burn down?

334
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,000
Well, like the constable likes to say,

335
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,320
it all started when a bolt of lightning
struck the insurance policy.

336
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,840
Mrs. Jennings?

337
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,120
It's Colin Cunningham.

338
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,960
Uh, I'm coming in.

339
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,120
Hello?

340
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Ailsa?

341
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,280
It's Colin.

342
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,640
That explains the dead birds.

343
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,000
Ailsa?

344
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,840
-She's probably at church.
-It's Tuesday.

345
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,280
Yeah, I know. She has, like,
a part-time job there as a bookkeeper.

346
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,840
And you're just remembering this now?

347
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,280
Your dad's right. You are a nitwit.

348
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,200
Oh.

349
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,920
Rather cutting.

350
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,000
You know, it's not that far from here,
if you wanna drive over.

351
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,360
No, I can't miss the ferry.

352
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,680
In a way, I'm relieved.

353
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,360
What was I supposed to ask her?

354
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,920
What was it like losing your son?

355
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,600
No offense, but… what a place to grow up.

356
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,360
No wonder Merritt ran away.

357
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,960
Everything dies here.

358
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,920
Well, it's not that easy
to get away from here.

359
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,200
-Merritt did.
-No, she only thought she did.

360
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,840
In the end,
she died in the same water as Harry.

361
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,000
-Right.
-Paradise on earth.

362
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,920
But when you've gotta go,
you've gotta go, so he finds this dune,

363
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,520
squats down behind it,
does his dirty business.

364
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,360
And we all know it's him.
Ruined the place.

365
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,280
Then this wee dog
crawls in the house, a spaniel.

366
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,280
He blamed it on the spaniel.

367
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,160
We're like, "There's no way
something that big comes out a spaniel."

368
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,200
The thing was bigger than the spaniel.

369
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,200
Evening, Carl.

370
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,520
Evening, Victoria.

371
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,040
So, love, what happened
to my snow globe collection?

372
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,160
Burgled by someone with no taste.

373
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,960
He threw them all in the bin.

374
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,600
But don't worry, I managed to shield
your lovely prints from his evil clutches.

375
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,160
Thank you, Martin.

376
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,440
The place looks just as I left it, Carl.

377
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,200
Mm-hmm. Like a mausoleum.

378
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,280
Mm.

379
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,720
I haven't got long.
I'm back out on the Frankfurt flight.

380
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,480
-You let yourself in. It's your meeting.
-I let her in.

381
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,400
-And you know the way out.
-Charming as always.

382
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,480
Bye, babe.

383
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,000
-You look rough.
-I nearly died.

384
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,720
What? This morning?

385
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
Hmm.

386
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,000
How's what's-his-name in duty free?

387
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,000
-He's a fucking pilot.
-He's a fucking dick.

388
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,120
Mm.

389
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,840
Okay. Jasper left.
He's staying with your mum.

390
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,280
I assume she phoned you,
hence this lovely surprise.

391
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,360
Yeah, she phoned me. What happened?

392
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,720
What happened is
you played him that fucking voicemail.

393
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,520
No, that's not the reason he left.

394
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,960
He and I made a deal.
A pact. Things were better.

395
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,320
You made a deal? He needs a father,
not a fucking car salesman.

396
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,480
And then you poke your nose in
and balls it up.

397
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,320
It's like you want to sabotage things.

398
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,280
-Fucking amazes me.
-Why would I wanna do that?

399
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,040
Why would you play him the voicemail?

400
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,640
-I want him to know it wasn't his fault.
-What wasn't his fault?

401
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,640
The way you are with him.
With everyone, really.

402
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,600
I want him to know it's not about him.
It's about you.

403
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,920
What? He idolizes you,
and you just push him away.

404
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,440
Idolizes me? He barely grunts at me.

405
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,440
Oh, he's 17. He's not exactly
gonna recite poetry, is he?

406
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,000
But when you were rushed into hospital,
he was there.

407
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,720
And he never left
until you were out of surgery, out of…

408
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,600
danger.

409
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,760
How do you know that?

410
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,040
Mum told me.

411
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,800
Never said anything to me.

412
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,840
Did you ever ask him?

413
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,120
Did you ever think
how scared he must have been?

414
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,760
It wasn't exactly a picnic for me either.

415
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,560
Did you ever explain that to him?

416
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,040
It's not the easiest thing
to drop in a conversation, Vic.

417
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,800
I'm not saying it's easy, Carl.
He's angry, but you're his stepdad.

418
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,360
Maybe he's angry because his mother
fucked off to parts unknown.

419
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,960
-We're having another conversation.
-Oh, I beg to differ.

420
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,000
He needs you, so when you shut him out,
it feels like punishment.

421
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,880
I don't shut him out, for fuck's sake.

422
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,200
Shall I play that voicemail for you?
"Oh, I think maybe I'm better off alone."

423
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,680
-That's not about him!
-That's my point.

424
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,480
Jasper needs to know that the problem is

425
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,120
whatever goes on
inside of that head of yours, not him.

426
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,040
I need to go.

427
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,160
-You want me to go and pick him up?
-Nah, leave him.

428
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,840
Mum will be driving him mad.
He'll be home soon enough.

429
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,480
But you need to think
about what it is he's coming home to.

430
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,560
Uh-huh.

431
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,920
Oh, sorry.

432
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,560
Not at all.

433
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,800
I was waiting for you.

434
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,080
To hear about Mhòr.

435
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,560
It was interesting.

436
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,920
How so?

437
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,240
-Where did you get this?
-The Lingard robbery and assault file.

438
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,680
My pal Colin sent it.

439
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
Colin?

440
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,000
Cunningham's deputy and son.
In that order.

441
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,920
Also my future gay husband.

442
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,680
It's listed as "Diamond pendant
on platinum chain

443
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,600
belonging to Lila Lingard."

444
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,720
Listed where?

445
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,600
On the insurance claim.

446
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,840
But it wasn't stolen.

447
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,040
Not then, it wasn't.

448
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,120
Merritt came back for it.

449
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,480
-When?
-On the day of Harry Jennings's funeral.

450
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,800
Fuck you, you sick fuck.

451
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
Sick fuck.

452
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,480
Is this what you want?
Eh, you want me like this?

453
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,360
Here you are, prick! Here you are!

454
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
Hello?

455
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,640
Continue.

456
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,120
Jasper?

457
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,920
Jesus fuck.

458
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,600
You scared the shit out of me, Carl.

459
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,600
I thought you hated the kids' music.

460
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,760
I do. I loathe it.
So I decided to study it.

461
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,320
See what the kids are drawn into,
like any good archaeologist.

462
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,040
You're getting a doctorate in philosophy.
Or have you changed your mind again?

463
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,560
A philosopher, Carl, is an archaeologist
of the mind, don't you think?

464
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,120
I honestly don't give a fuck.
What is all this?

465
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,040
I thought you and I could have
a nice dinner and a talk.

466
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,480
-You know how much I love talking to you.
-'Cause you need to talk to somebody.

467
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,080
Made your favorite. Liver.

468
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,440
Who told you my favorite was liver?

469
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,480
Jasper.

470
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,760
He was fucking with you.

471
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,600
It's actually quite funny.

472
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,240
Dare I ask what it is
that you wanna talk about?

473
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,920
Leith Park.

474
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,240
What the fuck for?

475
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,720
Because,
as my favorite philosopher likes to say,

476
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,280
healing yourself is connected
with healing others.

477
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,320
-Yoko Ono.
-Yoko? Not John. Yoko?

478
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,080
"A dream you dream alone is only a dream.
A dream you dream together is reality."

479
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,560
He was the twee to her sincere.

480
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,320
My therapist thinks I can heal myself
by talking about Leith Park with her.

481
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,680
You see a therapist? Voluntarily?

482
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,360
Fuck no, it's department mandated.

483
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,840
Thank God. The world remains as I know it.

484
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,880
Think I can heal myself
talking about it with you?

485
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,080
Good luck, friendo.

486
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,920
Not with me. Not even with your therapist.

487
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,160
With Jasper.

488
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,280
-Were you listening to our conversation?
-Well, it was kinda hard not to.

489
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,280
It's actually easy.
You just mind your own fucking business.

490
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,880
Look.

491
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,880
Victoria's not wrong.

492
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Okay.

493
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,800
The bullet went in here,
and it came out here.

494
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,040
You can see that.

495
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,840
Give me fucking strength.

496
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,880
The bullet

497
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,320
went in here,

498
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,200
and it came out here

499
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,080
after, after

500
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,680
it went through Hardy's spine.

501
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,680
-Oh.
-Yeah.

502
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
"Oh."

503
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,480
Hardy slowed it down,
which no doubt saved my life.

504
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,920
He, meanwhile,
is paralyzed from the waist down.

505
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,760
One good arm, one with half mobility.

506
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,400
And as we all know, PC Anderson
wasn't quite that fucking lucky.

507
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,160
Victoria said he was scared
when he saw me in hospital.

508
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,360
How's he gonna feel
when he hears all of that?

509
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,520
How's he gonna feel when I tell him
that even if we were armed,

510
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,080
it would've come out the same?

511
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,320
You know why that is, Martin?
I'll tell you.

512
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,160
No matter how many fucking platitudes
you find on the Internet,

513
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,440
the world is a seriously dangerous place
to be where no one is ever safe

514
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,000
from one bad surprise
ruining their entire fucking life.

515
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,600
Do you know why that is, Martin?

516
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,800
Because the most dangerous
fucking creatures on this planet are us.

517
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,160
Now I'm gonna take a shower,

518
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,880
I'm gonna come back, we're gonna sit down,

519
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,440
and we're gonna eat that fucking liver.

520
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,560
Preferably in silence.

521
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,080
Well, I can assume William didn't see
his father on the ferry or at home.

522
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,680
Why can we assume that?

523
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,080
Because we can also assume William
could recognize his own fucking father.

524
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,440
Even after 12 years?

525
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,200
All right, Rose. Come on.
Share with us your theory.

526
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,200
Share why you think Jamie is involved
with his own daughter's disappearance.

527
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,560
-I can't wait. Let's go.
-I don't know why, Carl.

528
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,760
I just know
that according to William himself,

529
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,000
he saw someone wearing a cap,

530
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,720
both on the ferry and at the house,
with the name of Jamie's boat on it.

531
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,080
No, he saw someone wearing a cap
with the image of a fucking bird,

532
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,160
but you,
amateur ornithologist that you are,

533
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,000
have decided it's the same fucking bird
as the name of Jamie's boat.

534
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,280
Have I got that right?

535
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,120
-You're doing that thing you do.
-What thing?

536
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,440
The thing where you disagree
just to be disagreeable.

537
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,800
I'm disagreeing with you

538
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,320
because you haven't thought it through
enough to make me agree.

539
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,240
Well, what about the necklace, huh?

540
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,720
The mother's.
The one that Jamie said that Merritt took.

541
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,720
-What about it?
-Maybe Jamie was trying to get it back.

542
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,080
Let me get this straight.

543
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,680
He was stalking his own daughter,

544
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,680
then he kidnapped and/or killed her
to get the necklace back, is that right?

545
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,280
Okay. That's ridiculous.

546
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,360
-Yeah.
-Fuck.

547
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,160
-Akram, what are those?
-Came from the Crown Office.

548
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,600
-You gone through 'em all?
-Most of them.

549
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,120
Anything good?

550
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,280
The woman seemed to have no life.
There's nothing in her diaries.

551
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,480
Phone records.

552
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,040
All to and from home,
and to and from the office.

553
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,920
It's like she went straight home
every night.

554
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,200
No dinner with the highers-up.
No drinks at the pub with colleagues.

555
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,960
"I miss you already."

556
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,840
"Look forward to the next time.
Same room?"

557
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,160
"I believe that bed brings good luck."

558
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,440
Signed, "S."

559
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,080
So she didn't always go straight home.

560
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,800
Who the fuck is "S"?

561
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,880
There's the name of the florist,
but no date.

562
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,960
Meaning she could have got this
anytime before she disappeared.

563
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,160
I doubt they still have a record
of that order.

564
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,000
-Maybe someone remembers the card?
-From when?

565
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,240
Again, who knows when she got this?

566
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,160
Yeah, but she saved the card
for some reason.

567
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,800
"Same room."

568
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,640
-A hotel.
-But which one?

569
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,640
This lot came from her office, yeah?
Who packed it up?

570
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,560
Her PA, um,

571
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,280
Sabrine Perera.

572
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,320
Sabrine.

573
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,880
Was this a loo or something?

574
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,240
Shower quarters.

575
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,880
Ah, of course.

576
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,440
Merritt had a reputation
for being aggressive.

577
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,760
That's one way to put it.

578
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,200
How would you put it?

579
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,200
She provoked people.
Went straight at them. Tested them.

580
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,480
Merritt didn't really care
what people thought about her.

581
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,480
Long as they thought
she was good at her job.

582
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,560
-And did they think that?
-They had to because she was.

583
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,920
Stephen Burns said that she didn't fit in.

584
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,440
Neither of us did.

585
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,360
I think that's why she took me with her.
So she'd have an ally.

586
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,440
Against the rugby boys
from the posh schools?

587
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,480
We used to joke about them.
Good teeth and bad attitudes.

588
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,000
-It was us against them.
-Yeah, I know the feeling.

589
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,760
They try to intimidate you.

590
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,880
Make you feel like a wee cog
in their big boys' machine.

591
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
What?

592
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,680
Are you finished?

593
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,320
-So…
-Sorry.

594
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,080
…Merritt was strong? A survivor?

595
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,440
Survivor? Are you kidding?

596
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,440
She absolutely thrived on that stuff.

597
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:45,600
So she could survive, say,
in, um, difficult situations?

598
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,160
You think she could be alive?

599
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,320
It's possible.

600
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,560
Nah, it's been four years.

601
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,160
And I don't think she'd just up
and abandon her brother or me like that.

602
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,360
If she was alive, I would just know.

603
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,000
Because you were that close?

604
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,480
-We just always had a connection.
-Oh yeah?

605
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,440
-That was never gonna happen.
-Why not?

606
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,480
Because we weren't batting
for the same team.

607
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,640
Speaking of, do you remember this?

608
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,680
No.

609
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,480
You packed it up
with the rest of her office stuff.

610
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,360
If you say so.

611
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,200
Any idea who "S" might be?

612
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,640
You think that's me?

613
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,240
I think it's someone
whose name begins with "S."

614
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,800
The word "someone" starts with "S."

615
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,320
Could be fucking anybody.

616
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,520
-Call the fucking florist. Ask them.
-Uh, we did. They're out of business.

617
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,280
Could it be someone from work?

618
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,480
Christ, I hope not.

619
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,000
Is this really all you've got?

620
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,880
So this is just what it looks like.
A publicity stunt and a waste of time.

621
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,920
-We want to find her.
-So did the last guy. Look how far he got.

622
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,360
The last guy fucked up.

623
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,440
Mm.

624
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,760
Least he wasn't working out of a loo
in the arse end of the station

625
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,280
with what looks to me
like a pair of temporaries from a PA pool.

626
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,800
No wonder you were so well liked.

627
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,160
Just tell me why you think
you're gonna do any better.

628
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,240
'Cause I'm doing it.

629
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
Shit.

630
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,120
You actually sound like her.

631
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,520
If Merritt was seeing someone,
I would have known.

632
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,680
All those alpha males,
and none of them ever tried their luck?

633
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,040
Of course they tried.
They all fancied her.

634
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,520
They were probably running a sweepstake.
But she wasn't interested.

635
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,720
When she talked about them,
it was like they were beneath her.

636
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,360
She wasn't friendly with any of them?

637
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,680
I don't know.

638
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,400
Maybe Liam.

639
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,840
Only because hey worked
the Finch case together,

640
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,040
and that was more cordial than friendly.

641
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,920
-Liam Taylor?
-Aye.

642
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,400
He was a good prosecutor.
And happily married.

643
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,760
So he wasn't always panting after her
like the others.

644
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,480
-Why'd you say "good"?
-That was how Merritt rated him.

645
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,960
-She ever express any interest in him?
-I asked her about him once.

646
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,640
She said she saw Liam more as a challenge.

647
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,560
But she knew he was happily married.
She would never go there.

648
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,520
So if Merritt had a fella,
it was someone outside the office.

649
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,040
-What are you doing? You're not a tourist.
-It's good luck.

650
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,240
Not for the dog.
He's had his nose replaced twice. Come on.

651
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,240
Ladies and gentlemen,

652
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,640
I'll keep this short,
being a man of few words.

653
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,400
Yeah, right.

654
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,840
All right, all right.

655
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,400
Um, you should be proud of yourselves.

656
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,800
I know how hard you've worked,

657
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,640
and I know
how little recognition you'll get.

658
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,880
But I would like to say
thank you and well done,

659
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,600
and it feels fucking good to win.

660
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,000
-It's the wee one's birthday.
-Mm.

661
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,160
Bright and early.

662
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,080
Carl fucking Morck.

663
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,880
Liam Taylor, in the flesh.

664
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,720
Liam Taylor, I am Akram.

665
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,200
-I heard you were dead.
-Only on the inside.

666
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,600
We were just talking about you.

667
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,160
Can you hang around for a bit?
After I speak to your boss.

668
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,840
It's Kelly's tenth birthday.
We're having a family dinner.

669
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,600
Okay. Do you still do
that weird polar bear routine?

670
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,360
Every morning. Keeps me young.

671
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,400
Yeah, right up until
your fucking heart explodes.

672
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,960
-I'm glad you're still alive.
-Yeah, I'll find you.

673
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,680
You celebrating?

674
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,040
Three convictions
in a big money laundering case.

675
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,320
That's not gonna go down well
at the golf club.

676
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,400
Who has time for golf?

677
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,080
-I don't think we've met.
-I am Akram.

678
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,600
He holds my umbrella.

679
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,400
Is there something I can do for you,

680
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,440
aside from listening to
your tired old routines about the weather?

681
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,240
"I miss you already."

682
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,320
Excuse me?

683
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,760
"I can't wait for next time."

684
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,720
"Same room, same bed."

685
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,160
Blah, blah, blah.

686
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,400
Sorry, you've lost me.

687
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,720
It was a note attached to some flowers
that were sent to Merritt.

688
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,840
Sent from who?

689
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,280
An admirer with the initial "S."

690
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,960
Ah, I see.

691
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,200
Any idea who that might be, Stephen?

692
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,240
None.

693
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,920
And to be clear, Merritt and I
never discussed her personal life.

694
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,880
But you were her supervisor, her mentor.

695
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,000
All the more reason. I had no idea
what she got up to outside the office.

696
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,560
What about inside the office? People have
work relationships all the time.

697
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,440
And I'd still expect them
to behave professionally.

698
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,280
If people did what we expected of them,
you and I would be out of a job.

699
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,640
Oh.

700
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,440
That wouldn't be
such a bad thing, would it?

701
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,000
Anything else? Or would you like
to risk another question?

702
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,680
Not today.

703
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,400
Very nice meeting you, Lord Advocate.

704
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,800
Oh, fuck off.

705
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,320
-Cup of tea?
-You should be sleeping.

706
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,680
-And wait for the water to boil this time.
-Whatever.

707
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,720
-Maybe if you can find me a wee biscuit?
-Go to sleep!

708
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,680
Well done, Merritt.

709
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,280
Water looks delightful.

710
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,480
I got a shriveled knob just watching you.

711
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,800
You should try it.
Great way to wake yourself up.

712
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,960
Assuming one wants to wake up, yeah.

713
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,280
Aye, I remember you
in those early morning case conferences.

714
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,320
Real ray of sunshine.

715
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,760
Well, speaking of cold and cases…

716
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,800
Aye, okay.

717
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,760
You and Merritt Lingard worked
the Graham Finch case together, yeah?

718
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,440
We did.

719
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,960
How'd you find her?

720
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,040
Ambitious. Annoying.

721
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,560
She was very focused.
Not much of a team player.

722
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,400
-Didn't think much of her colleagues?
-She did not.

723
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,800
But I never had a problem with her.

724
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:55,080
Her former PA said that
Merritt thought of you as a challenge.

725
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,360
-Challenge?
-Yeah, you know, a…

726
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,560
A test, a… prize to be won.

727
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,480
I'm flattered, I guess.

728
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,600
Everyone keeps telling me
Merritt loved a challenge.

729
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,880
She passed all the tests,
that she won all the prizes.

730
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,520
And I'm wondering,
if she thought of you as a challenge,

731
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,720
did she act on it?

732
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,400
And as she usually got what she wanted,
if she did act on it…

733
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,040
-I'm asking did--
-Did I fuck Merritt?

734
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,800
-Or vice versa, yeah.
-Fuck sake, Carl.

735
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,200
Change my mind, Liam.

736
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,560
Tell me nothing happened between you.
Tell me you didn't go there.

737
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,320
-I don't know what to say.
-You say it didn't happen.

738
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,360
It didn't happen.

739
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,400
-Fucking hell, Liam.
-Carl…

740
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,480
Does Martha know?

741
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,080
Of course not.

742
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,080
Course not.

743
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,360
How did it start?

744
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,400
It was like you said. Merritt got me
in her sights for some reason.

745
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,480
Then we went for a drink after work.

746
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,320
We both got a bit pissed.

747
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,200
Then she kissed me,
and one thing led to another.

748
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,520
-Lasted a month.
-Took you a month to come to your senses.

749
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,120
It was Merritt. She ended it.

750
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
Why?

751
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,840
She just did it.
No warning, no explanation, no big fight.

752
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,200
Just, "Thanks. I'll see you around."

753
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,360
I kept my distance after that.

754
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,720
So you're married.
She never brought people back.

755
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,040
-Where did you meet up?
-A hotel.

756
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,720
-Which?
-Prince's Garden.

757
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,440
-Did you ever send her flowers?
-She'd have hated that.

758
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,080
Do you remember any dates?

759
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,240
-No, but she always paid.
-Oh, looking out for you.

760
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,480
-There'll most likely be a record.
-It was a while ago.

761
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,080
Over a year before she disappeared.

762
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,480
None of this has anything to do
with your investigation.

763
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,320
The only way
Martha finds out is if you tell her.

764
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,600
Doesn't have to go in a file?

765
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,440
So you messed around.
She dumped you. You felt played.

766
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,040
-Then what? I waited a year to kill her?
-I don't know if anyone killed her.

767
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,440
You have to be thinking it.
An investigation usually presumes a crime.

768
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,600
The real crime are those fucking Speedos.

769
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,920
Don't worry. I won't put you in the file.

770
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,160
She used a different name.

771
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,320
She checked in as Lila Graham.

772
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,560
-Are you sure?
-She had a credit card in that name.

773
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,320
I remember 'cause I made some gag
about prosecutors committing fraud.

774
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,200
I bet she laughed her arse off.

775
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,320
She just said, "Now you're safe.
You have something on me."

776
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,440
DCI Morck, this is Marcus,
the assistant manager of the hotel.

777
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,000
How do you do, Marcus?

778
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,200
Detective,

779
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,520
as I've said to your associates,
I can't help you.

780
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,560
-Sorry you came out here, but I'm afraid--
-Shut up, Marcus.

781
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,880
How long do you keep
your guest records for?

782
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,400
-Five years, but again--
-Shut up, Marcus.

783
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,760
We're currently investigating
the disappearance of a woman

784
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,240
who may have stayed at this hotel
before she went missing.

785
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,080
We know for certain that she stayed here
a year or so before that.

786
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,840
So that's four years,

787
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,840
two Olympics, one World Cup,
and four prime ministers ago.

788
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,240
-If you please.
-You need a warrant.

789
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,200
It's just confirmation.
It's not 50 kilos of cocaine.

790
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,440
Be that as it may, I'm not allowed
to release personal information.

791
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,880
That data is all protected by law now.

792
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,080
Data Protection Act, 2018.

793
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,920
Thank you, Akram. Helpful.

794
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,120
As I told your associates,
I could lose my job.

795
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,640
You could lose your job
if I tell your higher-ups

796
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,640
that you're procuring prostitutes
for your guests.

797
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,720
I do no such thing.

798
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,280
And that you've got a fucking maid
who deals oxy off her cleaning trolley.

799
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,240
-That is absolutely not true.
-I know. It's shit, innit?

800
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,600
-This is harassment.
-Call the police.

801
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,640
Same room six times
in the two months before she disappeared.

802
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,640
All this time they could've been tracking
financial history for Lila Graham.

803
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,160
Yeah, we're doing that now.

804
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,880
What type of person uses
the name of her dead mother?

805
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,160
What is an "authorized guest"?

806
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,360
Someone authorized to sign
for room service, bar tab, whatever.

807
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,840
-Why would she do that?
-'Cause she was never here.

808
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,080
-She's on the computer.
-It's Lila Graham's name on the computer.

809
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,480
It's Liam Taylor's signature

810
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,680
on any evidence
that puts Merritt in the room.

811
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,440
Fucking paranoid bitch.

812
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,000
Except I'm looking at the record
of the last time she was here,

813
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,320
and that is not Liam Taylor's name.

814
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,440
Who the fuck is Sam Haig?

815
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,000
Well, today's the day, Merritt.

816
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:23,600
You've had enough time to think.
Now's your chance to answer the question.

817
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,160
Why are you here?

818
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,480
Like they say,
the truth will set you free,

819
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,120
but, oh, if you don't answer right,

820
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,680
we'll give you another month
to think about it and try again.

821
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,960
You okay in there?

822
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,160
First guess.

823
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,440
Make it a good one.

824
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,200
Sam Haig?

825
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,360
What did you do to Sam?

826
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,160
I'd love to take you to Benny Beg one day.

827
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,000
That's a great wee crag
to get you started climbing.

828
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,520
Who said I wanted to learn how to climb?

829
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,240
-You're dressed.
-Yeah, I have to go.

830
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,600
-Everything okay?
-Yeah. Something's come up.

831
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,560
Well, I'll only forgive you
if you tell me when I can see you again.

832
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,520
-I'll be gone for a while.
-Gone where?

833
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,080
Mhòr, for a bit.

834
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,400
Mhòr. What is on Mhòr?

835
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,320
It's an island.

836
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,600
Yeah, I know that.
But what's on Mhòr for you?

837
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,920
My father.

838
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Hmm.

839
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,360
-So how long will you be gone?
-Who knows?

840
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,480
Wow. "Who knows" is code for forever.

841
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,560
Please. I'm not going home
to live with my father.

842
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,800
I need to see him. And then, uh--

843
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,000
And then what?

844
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,000
-I'll ring you when I get back.
-Which is when?

845
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,840
I don't know. When I get back.

846
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,760
-You're a right font of information, you.
-Can't we just fuck without sharing?

847
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,800
Is that what we're doing now, is it?
Just fucking?

848
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,280
What did you think this was?

849
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,240
I have to go.

850
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,360
But you can stay.
Order some room service. Make a day of it.

851
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,240
Hey, Merritt.

852
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,480
Fuck you.

853
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:12,000
What did you do to Sam?

854
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,960
I used him.

855
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,760
That's all?

856
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,920
I was unkind.

857
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,040
Is this about Sam?

858
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,480
No.

859
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,320
But Sam Haig is dead because of you.

860
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,760
Sam's dead?

861
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,960
And every time you give a wrong answer,

862
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:56,360
you're gonna make things
just a bit more uncomfortable.

863
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,160
So from now on,
you might want to really think

864
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,760
before you speak.

865
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,640
The hyperbaric chamber
will begin to heat up

866
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,440
as pressure increases.

867
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,760
At five atmospheres, or 50 meters depth,

868
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:33,000
the temperature inside the chamber
will be around 32 Celsius,

869
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,720
or 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

870
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,480
The rule of thumb is
the deeper, the hotter.

871
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:43,920
Oxygen will become denser,
and it will become tougher to breathe.

872
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,800
A person may start to experience hyperoxia

873
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:51,520
or high levels of CO2 in their breathing.

874
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:56,440
These symptoms include
trembling, sweating, confusion,

875
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,240
headaches, and blurred vision.
