1
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,440
Thank you.

2
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,560
There were 18 cameras
to stop automobile break-ins.

3
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,040
They pick her up everywhere,
and then nothing. She's just gone.

4
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,960
Maybe she didn't want them to see her.

5
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,800
But more likely, she fell overboard.

6
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,000
Why do you say this?

7
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,240
Because who plans a murder
on a fucking ferry?

8
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,440
Once you've done it, you're stuck.

9
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,120
All right. Let's say it wasn't planned.
Let's say it was spontaneous.

10
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,640
Let's say she pissed off
some ned in the queue for a pint,

11
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,280
and he chucked her over.

12
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,520
Well?

13
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,840
-Someone would, of course, see this.
-Yeah, they would.

14
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,200
And yet here's a crowded boat,
and not one person saw, heard anything.

15
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,520
So short of
"She was beamed aboard the mothership,"

16
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,040
the most plausible theory is
that she ran away from her life,

17
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,080
or, less plausible, fell in by accident,
albeit without anybody seeing or hearing.

18
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,280
Unless someone took her.

19
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,320
They could overpower her,
stop her from screaming.

20
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,800
But kidnapping off a ferry
has all the same problems as murder,

21
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,640
as well as posing the question
of why the fuck

22
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,640
would you go
all the way out to sea to kidnap her,

23
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,280
and why would you grab her up
and not ransom her?

24
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,320
This is true. There is no ransom.

25
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,640
And if they simply wanted to kill her,
there are much easier ways.

26
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,520
But what if they made a mistake
and killed her by accident?

27
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,000
Four years later, and no body is found.
This is very strange, no?

28
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,880
Hope I'm not interrupting.

29
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,520
Oh, this isn't so bad, eh?

30
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,640
It's nice and quiet down here. Relaxing.

31
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,720
Mm, yeah, it's like a bloody health spa.

32
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,840
I'm relieved to see
your computer's working.

33
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,720
-You haven't answered any of my emails.
-They probably went straight into my junk.

34
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,800
Well, lucky for you, you've got
an assistant from the world of IT.

35
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,280
Perhaps he can help you.

36
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,640
Of course, ma'am.

37
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,680
I'm waiting for the report
on your first case.

38
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,800
Yeah, well, we're looking at
about 8,000 options, so how's spring?

39
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,000
You might remember the government gave us

40
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,520
a rather large sum of money
to set this department up.

41
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,240
When can we expect
that large sum to trickle down?

42
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,040
They'd like to announce it to the press,
but they can't until you decide on a case.

43
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,000
They must be desperate to look
like they're doing something.

44
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,520
Well, at least someone is, Carl.

45
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,000
-It's a process.
-Aye, a process.

46
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,000
Does that involve nicking open files
and logging, unauthorized, onto--

47
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,600
Come on, Moira,
you don't give a shit about cold cases.

48
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,240
-Choose a case or get out the building.
-Actually…

49
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,840
Oh, for God's sake, Carl.
Are we 12? Yeah? We're 12.

50
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,240
Detective Morck has just today
found a very interesting case.

51
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,360
I am surprised he doesn't mention it.

52
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,920
Because Detective Morck has found
many things that don't make sense.

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,440
Yeah, like why you're opening your mouth.

54
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,440
He thinks it could be deliberate,
not suicide.

55
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,840
Because there were no witnesses
and no body's ever been found.

56
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,840
I don't think that is what I think.

57
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,680
Merritt Lingard.
She was a blunt instrument, that one.

58
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,680
-Not unlike Detective Morck.
-Cheers.

59
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,800
There was probably a very long line
of people wanting her dead.

60
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,320
Prosecutor goes missing
at the top of her game. They'll love it.

61
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,840
At least give it a day or two.

62
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,280
I didn't know we had showers.

63
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,160
Get the fuck out of here, Judas.

64
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,960
-I will go clean the bathroom.
-We're in the fucking bathroom.

65
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,320
We focus on the witness, Caroline Kerr.

66
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,280
Have we got eyes on her?

67
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,840
Not really. She's not been out much.

68
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,800
Her mum does the shopping.

69
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,200
Caroline takes her wee man out
for a morning walk.

70
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,080
Still, not sure I'd walk my kid
around the same area

71
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,080
as I was tagged as a witness for a murder.

72
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,440
Maybe yours.

73
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,240
Thank you for the, uh,
as usual, keen insight, Carl,

74
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,120
but now, if you'll leave us.

75
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,560
She knows everyone who lives around there.
Even the wrong'uns.

76
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,440
-Maybe a few wrong'uns.
-D.C.I. Morck--

77
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,840
Probably the victim as well.

78
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,680
Estates like that,
everyone knows everyone.

79
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,800
You know this how?

80
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,760
Because, unlike you,
I grew up in a place like that.

81
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,640
We're watching her.
She's not been seen with anyone else.

82
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,280
They know you're watching.
They're probably watching you watch her.

83
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,320
She'll come through eventually.
I could tell she wanted to help.

84
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
What's the name of her kid? Hm?

85
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,600
You expect her
to risk her life to help you,

86
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,040
and you don't even know
the name of her child.

87
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,160
Are you here for a reason,

88
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,400
or are you just bored
downstairs in your basement?

89
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,360
'Cause we're busy.

90
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,000
-Fergus Dunbar.
-What about him?

91
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,200
-I wanna talk to him.
-Good luck with that.

92
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,520
-Was he transferred?
-He's in rehab.

93
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,160
Really? Good for him.

94
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,960
-Some weird fucking church.
-When did this happen?

95
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,000
Since he apparently lost whisky
and found Jesus.

96
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,600
You were still at home.

97
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,080
Recovering.

98
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,160
Which weird fucking church?

99
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,360
Fungus.

100
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
Morck.

101
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,640
Don't worry. Just came by
to pick your brain on an old case.

102
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,920
Merritt Lingard. Prosecutor.
Went missing off a ferry four years ago.

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,240
Yeah. I know who she is.

104
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,560
I'm wondering why
you're talking to me about her now.

105
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,320
Because I'm thinking
about reopening the case.

106
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,560
Guys, why don't we all go
and grab some lunch, eh?

107
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
I made up some egg sandwiches.

108
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,560
They're in fridge.

109
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,680
So far, in the last ten seconds,
I've learned more about you

110
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,520
than in the eight years
you were on the job.

111
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,240
I might not have been
the greatest officer.

112
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,120
I made some mistakes.

113
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,680
But if you've came here
to pin some cock-up on me, fuck off.

114
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,280
Now that is not
a very Christlike thing to say.

115
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,720
You see, I've taken responsibility
for everything I did.

116
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,280
This is about what you didn't do.

117
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,360
I did everything I could to find her.
I had divers in the water for weeks.

118
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,960
I had officers from…

119
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,200
eight local authorities
all searching the coastline,

120
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,320
all looking for her.

121
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,120
So you were there from the start?

122
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,320
I interviewed all the passengers that day.

123
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,120
And not just on their ferry.

124
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,920
On the other boat
in the water that day too.

125
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,520
But nobody saw anything, right?

126
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,960
Apart from the brother, but…
Well, that's a whole thing.

127
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,240
The brother. Remind me?

128
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,720
-Did you even bother reading the file?
-I read the bit where you arrested him.

129
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,320
There was footage
of the pair of them fighting.

130
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,080
Our thinking was maybe he pushed her over,
but there was nothing to back that up.

131
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,120
Not to mention he had some, uh… issues.

132
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Even if he had given her a shove,
that fall wasn't enough to kill her.

133
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,880
-Were there other suspects?
-Come on. Plenty.

134
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,200
In her line of work,
she had more enemies than we did.

135
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,320
Nothing that stuck.

136
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,760
I always thought
the brother was the key in all of this.

137
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,840
He was the one and only witness that day.

138
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,960
If anyone knows what happened to her,
it was him.

139
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,600
The Lingard brother, what's his name?

140
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,880
-I'm praying.
-No, I can see that.

141
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,480
But this… this is a police station,
not a mosque. What's his name?

142
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,400
-William Lingard.
-Where is he?

143
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,160
He lives at a treatment facility.

144
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,080
Which one?

145
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,880
Uh, it is called, uh…

146
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,000
Egley House.

147
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,280
-Thanks.
-Perhaps I should go with you.

148
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,960
My daughters are always texting me
videos of cats.

149
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,240
I don't know why.

150
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,040
I have two daughters, nine and eleven.

151
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,760
Before this, I was home with them,

152
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,080
but now my youngest,
she starts school, so…

153
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,480
They have Scottish accents.

154
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,480
It's very cute.

155
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,760
-How long have you lived here?
-Almost eight years.

156
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,360
-Why Edinburgh?
-They needed doctors.

157
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,160
My wife, she was a surgeon in Syria.

158
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,840
And you worked for the police?

159
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,560
Yeah.

160
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,920
It's the next exit.

161
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,120
I don't think we're supposed to park here.

162
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,920
I could've saved you the drive up here.

163
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,280
We don't allow Mr. Lingard
to see visitors.

164
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,160
And even if we did,
he wouldn't be much use to you.

165
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,120
Well, I'm aware of his condition,
and I can handle it sensitively.

166
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,560
I very much doubt that.

167
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,440
Last time the police tried
to interview him,

168
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,440
they insisted on prodding him for hours,

169
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,760
despite it being obvious
he had nothing to give them.

170
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,120
Well, as in any profession,

171
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,680
not all my colleagues are
equal in competence.

172
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,680
Your colleagues traumatized him,

173
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,440
left him even more withdrawn.

174
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
And for what?

175
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,800
He had nothing to do with his sister's
disappearance, nothing at all.

176
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,040
Well, we're in agreement,
but he was the last one to see her alive,

177
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,240
so I'd love to have the conversation.

178
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,000
It wouldn't be much of one.

179
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,440
-William suffers from aphasia.
-Which is?

180
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,920
In layman's terms, the part of the brain

181
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
responsible for language, expression,
and comprehension has been damaged.

182
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,400
He can't communicate?

183
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,560
There was a time
he was capable of some interaction,

184
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,760
though mostly non-verbal, of course.

185
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,360
But in the last few years, he's regressed.
He doesn't interact with anyone.

186
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,280
-What's he do all day?
-He draws.

187
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,720
-Draws?
-Pictures.

188
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,000
-Of what?
-Whatever he fancies.

189
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,640
There's no rhyme or reason
to his subjects.

190
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,880
-Well, can I see them?
-No, you cannot.

191
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,400
As I said, there's nothing
William can help you with.

192
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,640
Well, he is a grown man,

193
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,400
so he can decide for himself
whether he wants to see me.

194
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,120
He may be a grown man,
but the decision is not his to make.

195
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,040
Why is that?

196
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,520
One of the many conditions
of my bringing William here

197
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,520
was that I would become
his legal guardian.

198
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,040
-Why would you do that?
-It was the court's decision.

199
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,200
I'm considered a very safe pair of hands.

200
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,840
My institute pays
all of William's expenses,

201
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,960
which are considerable.

202
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,720
There's a tendency
for those less scrupulous than myself

203
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,080
to abandon patients like William
when they're deemed hopeless.

204
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,240
Is William hopeless?

205
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,520
I like to think no one is hopeless,

206
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,040
but he is helpless,

207
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,800
and, as such, unable to protect himself

208
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,920
from an errant inquiry
that may trigger him.

209
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,800
You'll have to trust
my judgment on this one.

210
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,360
Here's your speech,
parking pass, and the invitation.

211
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,800
And the speaking order?

212
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,600
Oh, my dear Elise.
Don't tell me you forgot.

213
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,640
How many times did I ask you to check?

214
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,480
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm awarding a colleague

215
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,720
at the Neurology Society luncheon
this afternoon.

216
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,920
I wasn't finished.

217
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,320
If you need anything further,
you can, of course, come back

218
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,960
with the appropriate warrant.

219
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,120
You make me come back here
with a warrant in my pocket,

220
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,280
it won't be just for him, it'll be
for your financial records as well.

221
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,960
Maybe we'll get the health department
down here, have a look around.

222
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,840
Think I saw a rodent on the staircase.

223
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,080
I don't know what you're alluding to,
but your tone is opprobrious.

224
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,280
Whatever that means.

225
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,480
It means I don't appreciate
your feeble misuse of force.

226
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,160
I don't give a fuck,

227
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,920
which means I don't give a fuck.

228
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,160
How lucky we are to have men like you
out there on the thin blue line,

229
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,320
patrolling our dangerous streets
and keeping us safe from harm.

230
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,240
Sometimes, the streets aren't
where the real danger is.

231
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,160
Oh, yes, I understand.

232
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,640
Feel free to search my office
for weapons of mass destruction.

233
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,640
I am learning so much from you, sir.

234
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,280
Fuck.

235
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,280
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I'm very sure.

236
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,200
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

237
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Carl.

238
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,440
Apparently, there is someone
who still comes for William.

239
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,600
Wallace said he doesn't get visitors.

240
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,280
She lied.

241
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,040
I'm shocked.

242
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,640
Well, they're not exactly visits.

243
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,040
-Maggie, the receptionist--
-Maggie?

244
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,160
Maggie tells me there's a woman
who comes once a week

245
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,280
to bring William baked goods
or a jumper and so on.

246
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,360
-A woman?
-Mrs. Claire Marsh.

247
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,720
She was the housekeeper

248
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,920
and William's carer
before Merritt disappeared.

249
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,600
-Once a week?
-That's correct.

250
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,280
So she's maybe… not far?

251
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,640
She's not.

252
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,720
-Doesn't seem to be anyone at home.
-Her car is here.

253
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,040
I hear something.

254
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,440
Akram.

255
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,840
What the fuck?

256
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
Twat.

257
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,560
Okay.

258
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,680
Oh, fuck.

259
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,040
I'm fine. Fuck off.

260
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,560
-Claire Marsh?
-Who are you?

261
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,360
-D.C.I. Morck, and this is…
-Akram.

262
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,920
What are you doing out here?

263
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,360
Just wanted to ask you a few questions
about Merritt Lingard.

264
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,400
Have you found her?

265
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,040
No, but I've got a few questions
about her disappearance.

266
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,560
A little late, don't you think?

267
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,960
You took care of the brother?

268
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,520
I did, but, uh…

269
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,320
haven't thought of either of them
in years.

270
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,320
Do you mean apart from the once a week
that you visit William at Egley House?

271
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,760
This is where you invite us in for tea.

272
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,320
I'm very protective of William.
I don't trust anyone when it comes to him.

273
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,240
You've seen how miserable that place is.
And that woman. Wretched cow.

274
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,440
You know she's writing
some fancy book about him.

275
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,000
-Were there no other family members?
-It was only ever the two of them.

276
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,840
He was in a council care home
when Dr. Wallace found him.

277
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,520
Not that one. That one.

278
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,080
Found him?

279
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,520
She heard about him
and wanted to study him at her…

280
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,240
-Mama.
-…private clinic.

281
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,240
Sorry.

282
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,520
Uh, study him?
It's a common enough disability, no?

283
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,280
-You don't know?
-Know what?

284
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,280
William isn't disabled.

285
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,000
Well, I suppose he is now,
but he wasn't born that way.

286
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,560
He had an accident when he was 16.
Suffered serious head trauma.

287
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,520
Milk?

288
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,240
-No, thank you.
-Yes.

289
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,480
-What sort of accident?
-Merritt wouldn't talk about it.

290
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,960
It was just one of those many things
one didn't ask her about.

291
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,320
It's an injury that caused his problems
with speech regression and so on.

292
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,480
Was he ever aggressive with Merritt?

293
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,760
Better not be starting that nonsense
about him pushing her overboard.

294
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,240
They did fight on the ferry.

295
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,280
-They didn't fight.
-He shoved her.

296
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,080
Help yourselves.

297
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,960
William could sometimes get frustrated.

298
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,560
Imagine being locked in your own head,

299
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,280
where you think you're communicating,
and yet no one else can understand you.

300
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,880
Sometimes he'd get confused,
lose his temper.

301
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,120
He never meant any harm by it.

302
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,640
Was he ever that way with you?

303
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,040
"That way"?

304
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,240
Violent.

305
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,560
No. Never.

306
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,480
Do you remember the weeks
before Merritt went missing?

307
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,240
Anything strange about her behavior?

308
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,920
It was a long time ago.

309
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,120
Not that long.

310
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,320
It was a normal week to me.

311
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,040
Merritt was a bit on edge about a case,
but every case set her on edge.

312
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,240
She was very ambitious.

313
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,760
The Graham Finch case.

314
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,520
The one she lost.

315
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,600
Yeah, thank you, Akram.

316
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,240
I couldn't say for sure,
just that she was always exhausted,

317
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,600
working all hours, coming home late.

318
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,000
Did she ever mention anything
about receiving threats?

319
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,400
No, but not that she'd tell me
something like that.

320
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,120
Merritt was a very private person.

321
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,960
Most people
didn't even know William existed

322
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,360
until after she disappeared.

323
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,160
Why keep him a secret?

324
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,960
Not a secret, per se,

325
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,520
so much as separate.

326
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,160
There was this line
between her work and her home.

327
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,920
Anyone ever come round?
Friends? Boyfriend?

328
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,800
Girlfriend?

329
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,000
Come round? To that place?

330
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,280
It was the middle of nowhere.
Took me an hour to get there each way.

331
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,400
The only person she had was me.

332
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,480
And even so,
she still never bothered to tell me

333
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,200
they were going on a trip that day.

334
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
I came to work, and they were just gone.

335
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,480
I saw the rest on the news,
like everybody else.

336
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,440
You didn't like her much, did you?

337
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,160
I mean, I must say,
she doesn't sound that likeable.

338
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,320
Always tense,
keeps secrets, rude, no friends.

339
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,960
And yet… you stayed
with the family for how long?

340
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,280
Twelve years. For William.

341
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,400
Not her. He needed me.

342
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,120
You say in your statement
she couldn't have jumped off the boat.

343
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,640
I only meant that if she had jumped off,
William would have jumped in after her.

344
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,040
He would have done anything for her.
Absolutely anything.

345
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,320
Cold as she was,

346
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,440
I can't accept
that she'd leave him on his own like that.

347
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,120
She wouldn't do that to him.

348
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,920
She loved him.

349
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,920
Far as I know,
he was the only person she loved.

350
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,080
I've seen too many cases like this.

351
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,960
Someone's there one day, gone the next.

352
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,840
How many of them did you find?

353
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
Not enough.

354
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,440
-What?
-Mr. Morck, I'm very sorry to bother you.

355
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,520
It's Louise here. Louise Eldridge.

356
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,000
-Who?
-Jasper's headteacher.

357
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,120
Oh, yes, um… Louise.
Sorry, what's the problem?

358
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,400
We haven't seen Jasper in school today,

359
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,520
and we're wondering
if you knew where he was?

360
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,920
Yeah, he's at school.

361
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,360
Jasper!

362
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,880
Power's out.

363
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,360
How long has this been going on?

364
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,520
It's the third time in 20 minutes.
The stamina kids have is--

365
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,320
I meant how long
has he been skipping school?

366
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,000
I don't exactly follow him around.

367
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,040
-I should go in there.
-Doesn't sound like the best time.

368
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,560
Fuck.

369
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,640
They don't wanna talk to you. Teenagers.

370
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,200
Oh, really, Martin, and you know this

371
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,000
because of all your years
of parenting experience, I suppose?

372
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,440
Well, you're probably unaware

373
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,120
that a teenage boy's frontal lobe
isn't fully joined until he's 23,

374
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,200
which means his decision-making
and impulse functions

375
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,400
aren't fully developed.

376
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,680
I'm having a pretty strong impulse
right now, Martin.

377
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,560
Okay, I tried.

378
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,520
Hi.

379
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,280
I'll just, uh… get my… bag.

380
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,400
Are you gonna introduce us?

381
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,520
Uh, no.

382
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,520
Where are you going?

383
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,480
Hell.

384
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,520
Well, I'll see you there!

385
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,000
Little shit.

386
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,960
Oh, fuck.

387
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,600
What about the power?

388
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,920
Hi.

389
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,520
How can I get the records
of all Merritt Lingard's cases?

390
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,320
Carl said to ask you.

391
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,960
-Me?
-Yes, we need them.

392
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,680
We?

393
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,400
We're currently investigating
her disappearance four years ago.

394
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,400
Yeah, I know the case.
You're working on it with him?

395
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,120
I'm assisting him, yes.

396
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,440
-He's up to something.
-Excuse me?

397
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,000
-Watch yourself.
-I don't--

398
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,320
Carl just doesn't let
someone like you assist him.

399
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,600
Someone like me? Meaning what?

400
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,320
Meaning someone not him.

401
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,800
Ah, yes. He's a lone wolf, as they say.

402
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,360
He's the fucking devil.

403
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,760
If he's being nice to you,
it's because he's using you.

404
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,400
-How do you know this?
-I was a junior on his old team.

405
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,960
Before he, you know, got shot.

406
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,960
Then what are you doing here?

407
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,000
It really wasn't a big deal.

408
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,680
What wasn't really a big deal?

409
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,960
I had this minor…

410
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,040
issue.

411
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,720
But I'm all good now, so…

412
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,120
So, um, the records I'm requesting.

413
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,360
-I'll get them.
-Thank you so much.

414
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,240
-Hi.
-Hiya.

415
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,640
Too much?

416
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,960
Oh, no. Looks good.

417
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,520
Actually, I was wondering
if I could talk to you for a moment.

418
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,520
It's about my caseload.

419
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,600
I've been on desk for a while now,

420
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,040
and I think it's time
that I got back out there.

421
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,920
Now, I know what you're gonna say,
but I haven't had an episode in months.

422
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,400
I'm taking my medication,
keeping my head down like you asked.

423
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,200
It's just not the right time.

424
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,800
I hear all your conversations.
I know you need the help.

425
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,760
-Yeah, but--
-Right. Is it because I'm a woman?

426
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,920
Seriously?

427
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,080
Carl, who right now is mental as fuck,
gets a whole department,

428
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,480
which he doesn't even care about.

429
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,560
-That's different.
-I'm just asking for a chance.

430
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,400
-We can discuss it when things calm down.
-When do things ever calm down?

431
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Yep, okay.

432
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,680
"When do things ever calm down?"
Fucking idiot.

433
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,880
So…

434
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,200
what shall we talk about?

435
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,400
How about how your best friend
was shot in front of you,

436
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,720
and you think it's your fault?

437
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
Fucking hell.

438
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,360
You sound a lot less bored than last time.
Is this some new kind of therapy?

439
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,320
You took Hardy there.
It wasn't your callout.

440
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,640
-And then you went inside without backup.
-Hardy went in with me.

441
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,040
-You were the senior officer.
-We were partners.

442
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,840
I saw the bodycam footage.

443
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,280
You were yammering away, making jokes.

444
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,360
What you call yammering, we call coping.

445
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,600
Whatever you call it,
you missed the guy in the kitchen.

446
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,920
The first officer should've--

447
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,640
He's dead and can't say
what he did or didn't do.

448
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,320
And it wasn't your first crime scene.

449
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,000
So let's be blunt with one another,
since you seem to prefer things that way,

450
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,800
and say what it was.

451
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,760
A giant cock-up.

452
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,840
One that left your best friend and partner
partially paralyzed, and you… What?

453
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,560
Grumpy?

454
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,120
Seriously pissed off.

455
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,440
Aren't you always pissed off at everyone?

456
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,640
Because you're so much smarter.

457
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,120
-If you say so.
-You say so.

458
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,000
And you say it often,
according to your file,

459
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,080
which I've now read
a little more carefully.

460
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,160
I just don't find any of this helpful,
if we're being honest.

461
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,160
-Then why did you come back?
-I was ordered to.

462
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,480
You don't strike me as someone who pays
much attention to such minutia as orders.

463
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,000
Maybe I just think you're pretty,
and I wanted to see you again.

464
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,400
How about that?

465
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,680
Wow.

466
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,880
Okay.

467
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,520
You weren't wearing that last time.

468
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,400
That's the mistake you think you made?

469
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,960
Regardless of my marital status,
you can't say what you just said anymore.

470
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,600
Well, I'm sure there's a hotline
you can call.

471
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,760
Fuck. Sorry.

472
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
Seriously.

473
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,320
I hope you're really happy.

474
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,840
I… I think, um…
I think we're getting a bit off track.

475
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,480
-Were we ever on track?
-I don't know. Maybe.

476
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,200
-Shall we start again?
-Yeah, definitely.

477
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,240
Okay.

478
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,080
Okay. I'll…

479
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,640
-I'll go out, and I'll come back in again.
-Oh, God. Look…

480
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,360
There's really no need.

481
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,800
It'll clear the air.

482
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,760
Excuse me.

483
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,600
Excuse me, where's…

484
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,000
Where's… Where's the guy
that was in this bed?

485
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,040
You'll have to talk to the duty nurse.
I just came on.

486
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,800
-Come on. Get the fuck out the way.
-Oh, shit. Yeah. Sorry.

487
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,800
On three. One, two, three.

488
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,080
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

489
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,520
We'll leave you to visit with your friend.

490
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,800
Whatever you've got in there,
you're not to share it.

491
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,680
Yeah, never.

492
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,120
It's a bit fucking early, don't you think?

493
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,400
More like just in time.

494
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,720
You look like shite.

495
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,160
-Well, it's been a day.
-Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

496
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,800
Came home and found Jasper
shagging some girl from school.

497
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,920
Yay for him.

498
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,680
-Do you want me to leave?
-It's up to you, mate.

499
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,760
Okay.

500
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
See you later.

501
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,960
Good morning, Merritt.

502
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,120
Hope you didn't think we'd forgotten you.

503
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,840
Had you been gone? I hadn't noticed.

504
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,040
We've returned from our holiday.

505
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,240
How lovely.

506
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,440
Did Shadow Number Two go with you?

507
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,200
Aye, we were down by the seaside.

508
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,560
The sun came out for a change.
It was even warm enough to swim.

509
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,880
And, of course, for ice cream.

510
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,760
It's a shame
neither of you managed to drown.

511
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,920
I'm sure you don't mean that.

512
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,200
Or you could have just stayed
where you were permanently.

513
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,840
What, and miss today?

514
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,680
What's today?

515
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,200
Is it your birthday or something?

516
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,840
Even better.

517
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,920
It's the end of the month.

518
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,800
And you know what that means.

519
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,800
I get cake?

520
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,360
That's the spirit.

521
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,880
Ready when you are, Merritt.

522
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,840
Why are you here?

523
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,120
Kirsty Atkins.

524
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,000
What did you do to Kirsty?

525
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,360
I put her in prison.

526
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,880
Of course you did.

527
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,640
Seven calls in three days.

528
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,080
Someone must be getting on well
with the POs.

529
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,000
You said before
that if I was willing to testify,

530
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,920
you'd do what you could to help me.

531
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,520
Well, yes, I said that
before you wasted my time in court.

532
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,320
-But here we are.
-Aye, here we are.

533
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,400
And there he is,
out walking and talking per usual.

534
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,960
-Who are we talking about?
-Graham Finch.

535
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,200
What about him?

536
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,000
I saw you on the telly, talking about him.

537
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,240
And it… jogged some things loose.

538
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,400
-Such as?
-I'll need some assurances.

539
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,400
Really?

540
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,480
Suspend my sentence.

541
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,520
Kirsty, no disrespect, but open your eyes.

542
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,480
You're sitting in a cage
in your prison jammies.

543
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,680
Do you honestly think you have
any kind of leverage?

544
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,800
I knew the wife.

545
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,960
-Okay.
-Let's just start with that.

546
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,960
Once you tell me
that I'm getting out of here,

547
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,440
I'll tell you all about how I met her
at a Women's Aid refuge two years ago.

548
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,920
Kirsty, I'm not doing this again.

549
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,040
If you've got something to tell me,
get it out with,

550
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,480
so I can get back to the fresh air,

551
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,960
and you can get back to copping smack
and shagging the screws.

552
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,480
-I'm clean eight months now.
-You want a hug?

553
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,440
I'm just saying, bitch.

554
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,360
I was baked 24-7 when I got grabbed.

555
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,240
Had you asked me
what my name was back then,

556
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,160
I would have said Princess Margaret.

557
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,080
But now, with all that paste
out my system,

558
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,080
I don't fucking recognize
that person anymore.

559
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,080
I just want to start over.

560
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,960
Get myself right.

561
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,040
-You would have to testify in open court.
-Whatever I have to do.

562
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,560
After you get me out of here.

563
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,000
I can't do that until you testify.

564
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,840
In the meantime, I can probably get you
into protective confinement.

565
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,560
PC? That's basically solitary.
Why the fuck would I do that?

566
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,560
I don't know, Kirsty.
Maybe your conscience?

567
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,520
You fucking cunt!

568
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,280
Get out, now!

569
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,000
You fucking arsehole!

570
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,560
You fucking cunt!

571
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,760
I'll kill you!

572
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,920
And you didn't help her, did you, Merritt?

573
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,680
No.

574
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,040
Why didn't you help poor Kirsty?

575
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,040
I thought she was lying.

576
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,360
Merritt.

577
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,760
She told me
she was in serious trouble, and…

578
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,080
I just left her there.

579
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,640
I could have helped her.

580
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,920
Yes, you could have.

581
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,160
Feels good, though, doesn't it?

582
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,160
To get it all out.
To realize just how vile you were.

583
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,360
And that now you're the one
who needs to pay.

584
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,560
It does feel good.

585
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,120
It feels very good.

586
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,280
That's a good lass, Merritt.

587
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,560
Right, so is that it?

588
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,400
Is… Is she dead?

589
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,720
Is what it?

590
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,040
This has all been about Kirsty Atkins?

591
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,080
Are you her sister or something?

592
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,040
Are you fucking kidding me?

593
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,000
Are you fucking kidding, Merritt?

594
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,000
Bravo, Merritt.

595
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,680
That was quite the performance.

596
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,320
The tears in particular. Nice touch.

597
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,360
-Oh, fuck off.
-So real.

598
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,160
What about George Ovenden, then?

599
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,320
Finn McBain? Connor Campbell?

600
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,680
Oh, come on.
You guessed him two years ago.

601
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,480
Donald Duck, then. I don't know.

602
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,320
Will you just kill me and be done with it?

603
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,880
I would rather die
than play any more of these fucking games.

604
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,840
And so you've said. Many, many times.

605
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,560
But you don't really mean it.

606
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,600
Fuck if I don't mean it.

607
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:18,640
If you really wanted to die,
you'd have stopped eating a long time ago.

608
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,840
You'd have found a way to kill yourself.

609
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,520
I really would have enjoyed watching that.

610
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,400
You can't keep me in here forever.

611
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,440
Hi, you've reached Victoria.
Please leave a message.

612
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,520
Hey, I don't know why I'm calling.

613
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,040
Except you might remember
I got shot in the head a few months ago.

614
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
I'm fine, obviously. No big deal.

615
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,640
Not that you called.

616
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,240
Uh, Jasper.

617
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,080
Fuck.

618
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,760
Jasper's same old Jasper.
I mean, hates my fucking guts.

619
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,440
I think he hates
everyone's fucking guts, actually.

620
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:05,840
Except for the girl he's been shagging.
Yeah, that's happening.

621
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,480
Hasn't been to school in over a week.

622
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,240
I know we said
that he was gonna be better off with me,

623
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,600
but I think I'm better off alone.

624
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,200
Akram?

625
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,040
I'm not sure I'm in the right place.

626
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,960
I'm gonna go with probably not.

627
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,960
D.C.I. Morck?

628
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,240
Yeah?

629
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,680
Stephen Burns.

630
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,400
I was Merritt Lingard's supervisor.

631
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,160
Back then.

632
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,240
Ah.

633
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,800
Well, what can I do for you?

634
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,600
I understand you're reopening the case,

635
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,520
and I, well, just wanted
to introduce myself.

636
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,800
It's very nice to meet you.

637
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:12,120
I imagine at some point
you're gonna have questions.

638
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,680
Actually, I've got a few right now.

639
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,200
-Can I just ask you something?
-Yeah.

640
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,840
Now, why choose Merritt
as your first case?

641
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,600
It just jumped out.

642
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,720
One of those cases you take one look at,
and you go, "Oh."

643
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,800
Just screams all wrong.

644
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,880
Really?

645
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,320
I see.

646
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,600
Weren't the two of you trying a case
just before she disappeared?

647
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,120
Yeah, Graham Finch.

648
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,800
Yeah, a guy chucked his wife
out of the window.

649
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,720
Down the stairs.

650
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,680
They were drunk, and she had just told him
she was leaving him.

651
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,640
Well, I bet she wanted to get him, no?

652
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,680
Oh, she certainly did.

653
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,320
Well, we all did.

654
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,720
-Yeah, but you lost that one.
-Well, the jury went against us.

655
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,040
-It happens.
-Well, not to her.

656
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:09,040
I mean, I've seen her records.
She wasn't exactly prone to losing.

657
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,880
No, she wanted to go
straight back after him,

658
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,520
charge him again with culpable homicide.

659
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,160
Would you say it, um, damaged her career?

660
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,120
Quite the opposite.

661
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,360
She'd easily have my job by now.

662
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,640
You know, you're doing
what a good advocate does.

663
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,760
What's that, then?

664
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,840
Asking questions
you already know the answer to.

665
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,400
Yeah, but you're not on trial.

666
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,720
Yeah, still, I feel as if I need a lawyer.

667
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:47,480
Well, I've got one of those personalities
that makes everyone feel that way.

668
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,200
Tell me, why did you tell the police

669
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,480
that you thought Merritt
had taken her own life?

670
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,400
There's one I don't know the answer to.

671
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,080
He got away.

672
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,600
She couldn't let it go.

673
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,800
I… I just don't think
it was in her nature.

674
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,800
She had a…

675
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,600
a dark side, you know?

676
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,400
Do you think there's a possibility
she's… she's still out there?

677
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,480
No, I don't.

678
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,520
But, I mean, anything's possible.

679
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,320
Sir, they want you upstairs.

680
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
For what?

681
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,920
Excuse me. I didn't mean to keep you.

682
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,520
I should be up there too. If you need me,
you know where to find me.

683
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,800
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed. Thank you.

684
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,560
Why are you interrupting?
And what the fuck are you talking about?

685
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,640
There is a press conference.

686
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,920
There's a what?

687
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,880
You're late.
Ugh, and you could have shaved.

688
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,400
Where's your tie?
Can we get him a tie and… and a coat?

689
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,720
Can't go out like this.

690
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,240
Lydia Brown, press liaison.

691
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,840
Here's your statement.
You'll be following the superintendent.

692
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,760
Whoa, wait.

693
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,720
Just read it. You'll be fine.

694
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,760
Moira.

695
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,160
Moira.

696
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,840
Hello, everyone.
Thank you for coming today.

697
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,920
I'll just make a brief statement.

698
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,880
My name is Detective Chief Superintendent
Moira Jacobson.

699
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,400
Following the successful outcome
of the Windley case up in Aberdeenshire,

700
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,360
we are here today to announce
a new department we're establishing

701
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,320
within the Specialist Crime Division

702
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,600
aimed specifically
at tackling unsolved murders

703
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,400
and other serious crimes
that warrant renewed investigation.

704
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,080
They'll be given every available resource

705
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,560
and the chance to work directly
with local prosecutors

706
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,200
and the police all across the country

707
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,080
to bring criminals who thought
they'd evaded the law to justice.

708
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,800
At the helm of this new department

709
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,440
will be our very own
Detective Chief Inspector Carl Morck,

710
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,800
who's here to share more details.

711
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,440
Thank you. Carl.

712
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,440
Thank you.

713
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,880
Good afternoon. Um…

714
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,960
Four years ago, we, um…
we lost a, uh… a champion for justice.

715
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,880
Someone whose tireless dedication
to the truth

716
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,560
put countless, uh, criminals behind bars.

717
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,600
Her disappearance was felt keenly
by those closest to her,

718
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,440
as well as by her colleagues
in the Crown Office,

719
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,080
and so it feels fitting
that Merritt Lingard's case is the first

720
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,400
that we will be, um, reopening.

721
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,400
We're determined to find,
uh, what happened to her,

722
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,480
and to do that,
we're, um, asking for your help.

723
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,840
Merritt was last seen on the ferry to Mhòr

724
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,800
on the afternoon
of Monday, 27th September 2021.

725
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,480
She was wearing a gray jumper
with green coat and blue jeans.

726
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,920
We're asking anyone who might have seen
or remembered anything from that time

727
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,920
or has any information about Merritt
to please come forward now.

728
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,080
-Any detail, no matter how small…
-Fucking…

729
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,640
-…could be crucial to finding…
-…bitch.

730
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,200
…Merritt and, uh, and… and… and,
uh… bringing her home. Thank you.

731
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,800
Detective!

732
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,000
Has there been any new evidence
around the case

733
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,360
that's led to this reopening?

734
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,400
Can you repeat the question, please?

735
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,040
Has there been any new evidence
around the case

736
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,560
that's led to this reopening?

737
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,160
I can't… I can't, uh… disclose
that kind of information.

738
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,960
Do you believe Merritt Lingard
could still be alive today?

739
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,920
We certainly haven't ruled out
any possibilities.

740
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,720
Are you any closer to finding the man

741
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,200
that shot you, Officer Anderson,
and James Hardy at Leith Park?

742
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,160
I'm not involved in that, uh…

743
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,200
investigation.

744
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,960
Dennis Piper, Scottish Telegraph.

745
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,320
Can you tell us if it's true
that you and D.I. Hardy knew the victim,

746
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,560
Archie Allen,

747
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,560
and that he was
a paid, confidential informer

748
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,800
that knew a lot
about a lot of police personnel?

749
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,240
-Who told you that? No, who told you that?
-No more questions. Thank you.

750
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,280
Is this just a distraction?

751
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,240
That's all. Thank you.
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

752
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,520
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
thank you.

753
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:32,360
Now, as the chief superintendent
and D.C.I. Morck have just said,

754
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,800
four years ago,
we lost a champion of justice.

755
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,680
Merritt Lingard devoted her work
to finding out the truth.

756
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,480
Hello?

757
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,200
Hello?

758
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,320
William!

759
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,760
Oh, God.

760
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,080
What is going on?

761
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,320
Oh, God.

762
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,360
Just breathe.

763
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,360
Oh, God. I think I'm having
a heart attack.

764
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,160
No, you're not having a heart attack.

765
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,800
Just breathe. Slow.

766
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,040
Oh, fuck off.

767
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,360
Okay, sit, sit. Relax. Sit down.
Sit down. Relax.

768
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,520
Breathe. Control your breathing. Slow.

769
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,200
Carl…

770
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,720
when I am praying, don't interrupt me.

771
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,320
Okay.
