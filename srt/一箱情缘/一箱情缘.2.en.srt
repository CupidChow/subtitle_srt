ONE DAY, MY DAUGHTER BROUGHT HOME
A MAN SHE SAID SHE WANTED TO MARRY

13
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,729
You canceled three days
before the wedding.

14
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,234
For cancellations made
three to five days before the wedding,

15
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,194
we can only offer a 30% refund.

16
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,447
It can take up to two weeks
for the transaction to be canceled.

17
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,826
We just need your signature here.

18
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,853
Excuse me?

19
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,397
Did you happen to drop this?

20
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,571
Yes, it was you.

21
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,781
You forgot it in the restroom,

22
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,450
so I picked it up.

23
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,582
I was throwing it away.

24
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,958
Keep it.

25
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,752
Or just throw it away.

26
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,423
It looks like a wedding ring.
Why did you end things?

27
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,262
Let me rephrase that.

28
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,515
How did you end up falling for
a bisexual person, Ms. Noh In-ji?

29
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,489
My name is Lee Seon.
I'm the COO of this establishment.

30
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,700
I'm also the CEO of NM.

31
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,831
First, the 70% penalty cancellation fee.

32
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:19,295
Now, a dissection of an engagement
that was called off three days ago?

33
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,881
You want me to fill out a survey?

34
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,219
As the CEO of NM,
I'd like to make you a proposal.

35
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,932
We're searching for employees
who can enter contract marriages.

36
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,060
They'll be assigned to different posts
every year,

37
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,521
and given executive-level salaries

38
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,898
that include bonus pay
and comprehensive insurance.

39
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,483
How does that sound?

40
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,821
Contract… what?

41
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,117
What's all the fuss over marriage anyway?

42
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,202
Perhaps, Ms. Noh In-ji,

43
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:55,331
you're the one to blame
for wanting an extravagant ceremony.

44
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,837
Perhaps none of this would have happened
if you had just kept to yourselves.

45
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,715
Did the social recognition

46
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,926
matter that much to you,

47
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,678
Ms. Noh In-ji?

48
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,022
You don't know
the first fucking thing about me.

49
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,025
A professional marriage.

50
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,572
It may be the solution
to the downsides of modern-day marriage.

51
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,036
Think of it as revenge, if you will.

52
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:45,256
THE TRUNK

53
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,843
We'll head straight to the ER.

54
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,513
We'll be there in ten, no, five minutes.

55
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,265
Okay.

56
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,667
I'm going to give you a shot now.
You'll feel a slight prick.

57
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,291
Han Jeong-won.

58
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,968
What brings you here?
Are you here to see your father?

59
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,178
I'm here for something else.

60
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,972
Since you're here, you might as well…

61
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,226
This is a hotel-grade hospital
with a medical team on 24-hour standby.

62
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,436
I don't need to see him.

63
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,022
But still…

64
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,066
Call me once he's passed.

65
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,443
I'll handle the funeral arrangements.

66
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,912
Ungrateful bastard.

I'll make sure it doesn't leave a scar.

70
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,473
A little more to the side,

71
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,059
and it would have fallen on your head,
not your arm.

72
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,355
You could have died.
Some people aren't worth getting hurt for.

73
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,607
You barely even know me!

74
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,610
Is that in the manual too?

75
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,530
Having a husband die
a week into the marriage

76
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,075
doesn't reflect well
in performance reviews.

77
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,458
If you want to thank me for saving you,
let's grab some burgers. I'm starving.

78
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,967
Two cheeseburger combos, please.

79
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,802
One with no tomatoes.

80
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,013
Sure, coming right up.

81
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,153
Here are your cheeseburgers. Enjoy.

82
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:55,905
Thank you.

83
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,641
Why aren't you eating?

84
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,435
I'm actually a vegetarian.

85
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,110
I forgot to ask for it without tomatoes.

86
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,742
So you even know how to joke.

87
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,663
-Do you not like tomatoes?
-Do you?

88
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,580
No.

89
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,209
Then let's leave tomatoes out
of any future salads.

90
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,103
It's gotten worse.
We should put some ointment on it.

91
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,656
Can I ask a question?

92
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:03,991
Yes?

93
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,621
-How many times have you been married?
-This is my fifth.

94
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,924
Does being married
help you have a better life?

95
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,552
Do you enjoy being married?
Enough to make it your profession?

96
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,472
You said you only had one question.
It's my turn now.

97
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,812
Why do you hate
the lights in the living room?

98
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,109
Who told you I hate them?

99
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,111
You made it obvious.

100
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,781
You turn your back
to avoid looking at them.

101
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,994
If you're done, we should go.

102
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,658
I asked Mr. Kim to take care of it.

103
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,662
I may have a preference for solitude,
but people still tend to me.

104
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,789
Call them if you need them.

105
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,664
You and your bitching!

106
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,795
Let me.

107
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,172
My hand slipped.

108
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,009
I don't normally eat breakfast,
so don't make anything.

109
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,762
I do eat breakfast, though.

110
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,263
Then just order something.

111
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,393
I don't want to have to worry about you.

112
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,939
I'll be going out now.

113
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,524
Where to?

114
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,693
I have a meeting.

115
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,154
You should have dinner at home.
I'll wait for you.

116
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,910
Can I use your car?

117
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,830
Use any of the cars in the garage.

118
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,382
A meeting at this hour?

119
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,666
So who's this woman you're marrying?

120
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,711
Someone you don't know.

121
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,464
There's no one I don't know.

122
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,633
So tell me, who is it?

123
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,604
Seo-yeon introduced her to me.

124
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,815
Lee Seo-yeon set you up?

125
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,275
And you actually agreed?

126
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,820
She said she'd take me back
if I lasted a year.

127
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,323
I see.

128
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,452
You're just a couple of fucked up
peas in a pod, aren't you?

129
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,081
How silly of me to try to understand
what goes on in your heads.

130
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,584
But what's our newlywed husband doing here
at this hour?

131
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,878
-It's awkward.
-What is?

132
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,214
The woman was injured…

133
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,217
because of me.

134
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,095
My being there might make things uneasy.

135
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,140
Hold up, you're already living together?

136
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,776
I told you I didn't require assistance.

137
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:59,531
There's a medical record now,
which somewhat complicates the process.

138
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,532
Please understand.

139
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,953
Was violence involved?

140
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,496
No.

141
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,708
Could the situation
have escalated to violence?

142
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,043
No.

143
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,463
Is there a possibility
of violence in the future?

144
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,551
Please alert us
if a code situation arises.

145
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,511
Keepers are always on standby nearby.

146
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,472
I…

147
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,140
Yes?

148
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:36,860
It's nothing.

149
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,593
It's not looking good.

150
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:47,681
I'm seeing inflammation as well.
I think we should remove the IUD.

151
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,225
And how about freezing your eggs?

152
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,978
I'm good.
I don't plan on getting pregnant.

153
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,022
But you might change your mind later on--

154
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,315
I said no!

155
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,487
Let's give it some time
and just replace the IUD.

156
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,574
<i>You didn't hear?</i>

157
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,118
Apparently, that woman
protected Mr. Han Jeong-won

158
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:11,788
as those expensive living room lights
fell on his head.

159
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,666
Is Jeong-won all right?

160
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,294
He's fine, but that woman's arm…

161
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,214
She had a cut this big,
so he rushed her to the ER that evening.

162
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,301
I don't believe it.
All that from a fallen decoration?

163
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:28,930
Sure, but isn't she amazing?
I couldn't have done the same.

164
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,642
For her to do something like that?

165
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,187
Maybe she really loves him or something.

166
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:40,400
By the way, the next Heritage Lounge
meetup is on the 15th.

167
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,236
They say there'll be a guest lecturer.
You'll be there, right?

168
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,280
Right.

169
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:46,948
Yes.

170
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,188
<i>I can't sleep.</i>

171
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,900
<i>The woman bothers me.</i>

172
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:24,820
<i>I need you.</i>

173
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,967
<i>She was hurt because of me.</i>

174
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:04,985
<i>She disturbs me.</i>

175
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,593
<i>The woman bothers me.</i>

176
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,721
<i>She makes me uneasy.</i>

177
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,848
You just left it like that?

178
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,360
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

179
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,782
Let's just watch soccer together.

180
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,418
What's your phone number?

181
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,421
I never saved it, so I couldn't reach you.

182
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:52,259
Had you saved it, would you have called
to tell me you were coming home late?

183
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,218
Yes.

184
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:58,306
I'd have said not to make anything for me.
Not that you'd have listened.

185
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,400
Here.

186
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,579
NOH IN-JI

187
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,338
Why do you enjoy
marriages like this anyway?

188
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,757
Answer me this time.

189
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,225
I wanted revenge.

190
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,812
When I started doing this, at least.

191
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,816
I've since come to realize
I'm rather good at this job.

192
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,364
Now you answer my question.

193
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,992
Why do you hate those lights so much?

194
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,674
My father attached…

195
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,137
a camera to that chandelier…

196
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:22,891
to keep an eye on my mother.

197
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,104
My mother was skinny, but she was tough.

198
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,107
Eventually, though,

199
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,026
she lost her mind.

200
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,032
My home was a living hell.

201
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,288
My father didn't want gossip,
so he never brought her to a hospital.

202
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,834
Later, her sleepwalking got so bad

203
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,546
that I had to follow her around
every night.

204
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,467
I was afraid she might kill someone.
Or herself.

205
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,861
<i>My father didn't beat me back then.</i>

206
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,199
<i>I could have done something to stop it.</i>

207
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,036
But I didn't.

208
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:35,130
That's why I hate those lights.

209
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,434
Why are you telling me all this?

210
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,856
You said you weren't trying to seduce me.

211
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,069
You said it was okay for me to be myself.

212
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,699
I've given it some thought
and decided none of it matters anyway.

213
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,745
It's like telling secrets
to someone who doesn't exist.

214
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,500
Company protocol dictates
you keep my secrets, no?

215
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:37,984
It's jasmine tea.

216
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:40,528
Have some before bed.

217
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:52,999
It smells great.

218
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,761
Once I finish this book,
let's go on a trip.

219
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,554
Maybe, we'll see.

220
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,558
Let's just go. I'll make it work.

221
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,604
Let's just go.

222
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,274
Later.

223
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:21,903
Hey.

224
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,656
-Answer me.
-Give me a second.

225
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,035
Hello?

226
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:35,542
Yes?

227
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,833
WIFE

228
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,557
<i>Hello?</i>

229
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:46,988
Is…

230
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,074
He just fell asleep.

231
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,952
He hasn't slept in days.
I shouldn't wake him.

232
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,748
Is it urgent?

233
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,797
Jeong-won's father
took a turn for the worse,

234
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,717
but he pulled through.

235
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,470
Give me a second. I'll wake him.

236
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:11,930
<i>It's fine.</i>

237
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,183
<i>There'd be little he could do here anyway.</i>

238
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,227
He's going to be all right.

239
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,272
Just tell him that I called.

240
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:23,650
Okay.

241
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:25,985
I'll tell him.

242
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,196
Has Jeong-won…

243
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,491
taken a lot of meds?

244
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,371
You said he fell asleep.

245
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:39,666
No.

246
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,001
He just fell asleep.

247
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,420
Just fell asleep?

248
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,298
I see.

249
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:52,929
All right, then.

250
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,551
-Hey, it's mine.
-No, it's mine.

251
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:34,679
-Take turns. Give Hwan a go too.
-You already had a turn.

252
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,765
-Take turns and keep it down, you two!
-But it's mine!

253
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,685
I can barely handle the kids
in the morning as it is.

254
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,271
Cut me some slack.
I really can't drive today.

255
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,399
I'm going to throw up mid-ride
if I take a cab.

256
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,737
What the fuck? That mothertrucker.

257
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,072
-A truck?
-Where's the truck?

258
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,367
Mind the children.

259
00:33:56,451 --> 00:34:00,079
Fucks like that won't learn their lesson
until they're six feet under.

260
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,582
Please stop swearing.
I'm getting motion sickness.

261
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,709
It's your own fault for getting hammered.

262
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:05,626
Right.

263
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,962
It's all my fault.

264
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,174
We won't have enough money for the remodel
even with a loan.

265
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,051
Maybe we should only fix half the house.

266
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,888
Why don't you try asking
Mr. Han Jeong-won?

267
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,473
What do you think he is, UNICEF?

268
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:19,807
Then again,

269
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,895
there's not much difference
between 90% to 5% and 90% to 4%.

270
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,688
Okay, fine.

271
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,483
I'll try to get a bigger loan
from the bank.

272
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:32,570
I run a tiny record label
and earn just enough to get by,

273
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:36,574
but having Han Jeong-won work for me
creates this strange illusion

274
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,326
that I'm part of the elite.

275
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,037
Honey, how about we move abroad?

276
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:44,665
I don't think Jeong-won's
ever going to stop working for me.

277
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,005
Keep it down!

278
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:39,762
You're awake.

279
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,351
Did I fall asleep on the sofa?

280
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,895
I wasn't strong enough
to move you to the bed.

281
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,110
We should go to the hospital.

282
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,574
Not for me,
but for you, Mr. Han Jeong-won.

283
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,287
It's a shame, really.
He was doing so well.

284
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,373
It's a good thing your wife was here.

285
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,834
I heard you were on Jeju Island?

286
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,670
Yes.

287
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,048
Okay then.

288
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,563
You should have done us a favor
and died last night.

289
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,441
Quietly, without anyone knowing.

290
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,952
NO RECENT MISSED CALLS

291
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,790
<i>Has Jeong-won taken a lot of meds?</i>

292
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,709
<i>You said he fell asleep.</i>

293
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:53,753
<i>No.</i>

294
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,214
<i>He just fell asleep.</i>

295
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,221
What are you doing?

296
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,722
I'm considering helping you.

297
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:52,144
I've heard it's not a crime
for married couples to turn a blind eye

298
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,396
to each other's crimes.

299
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,277
Yes, assuming you know a good attorney.

300
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,030
That being said, I do know a guy.

301
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:06,993
Then…

302
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,329
how about some revenge?

303
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,336
Thank you.

304
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,398
Looks like we won.

305
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,693
He's alive,
but can't enjoy great food like this.

306
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,284
You do things like that often?

307
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,454
What do you mean?

308
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,748
What was that thing you left
by the pillow?

309
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,252
I'm sure you've seen them
in period dramas.

310
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,005
They're dolls you can stick pins into.

311
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,970
That one's actually full of baby powder.

312
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,017
Having one helped me sleep
through even the stormiest of nights.

313
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:20,941
I slept well.

314
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,530
For the first time in about six months,
thanks to you.

315
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,116
I'm glad to hear that it worked.

316
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:42,838
"Wife."

317
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,510
That's how she's saved on your phone.

318
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:49,970
Have you contacted her yet?

319
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,307
I don't see how that's your business.

320
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,769
-I'll do as I please.
-She asked me if you had taken meds.

321
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:06,237
I don't think you'd do anything
she didn't like.

322
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,116
And she never tried to stop you.

323
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,663
I think she's the one
who suggested the drugs to you.

324
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:32,096
Please keep an eye on the vinyl covers.
Make sure they go on nicely.

325
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,640
-Sure.
-As for the curing process…

326
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,934
-Mr. Oh, sir?
-Zip it. Don't say a thing.

327
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,655
HAN JEONG-WON

328
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,584
You finally answered.

329
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:06,547
I'm sorry they got in touch with you
about my father yesterday.

330
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,759
It's fine. He wasn't the best
father-in-law, but I owed him that much.

331
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,764
-Want to get some tea?
-Maybe next time.

332
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,016
I have to be somewhere.

333
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,019
I see.

334
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:26,609
-I'll bring the lights once they arrive.
-Make sure to charge a lot for them.

335
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,778
You look well.

336
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,741
I actually fell asleep without meds.
On the sofa, no less.

337
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,827
It wouldn't be the first time.

338
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,540
I should get going.

339
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,042
Right.

340
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,559
Damn it.

341
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,525
Damn, I forget every single time.

342
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,279
What's the password?

343
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,283
For the love of…

344
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,536
Ms. Do-dam!

345
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,747
Sure, make yourself at home.

346
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:25,459
Look who's talking, Ms. Do-dam.
That's my vending machine you're using.

347
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,255
That's why I'm getting one for you too,
you cranky bitch.

348
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,967
Looks like I've gone and done you a favor.

349
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,803
Do you know how much cholesterol
is in these?

350
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,055
Please don't drink them then.

351
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,307
How can I resist ready-made coffee?

352
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,934
I feel you.

353
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:46,355
What are you even doing here this early?
Shouldn't you be working?

354
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,650
I told you,
you're destined to just scrape by,

355
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,235
even if you work your ass off.

356
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:52,861
Jesus!

357
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,864
Cut me some slack.
I have it tough enough already.

358
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,409
I have enough problems on my mind.

359
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,411
What kind of problems?

360
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,291
Remember Eom Tae-seong?

361
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:06,792
Who?

362
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:09,211
That fucking asshole
who used to stalk In-ji.

363
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,672
Word is, he's been released
from the mental hospital.

364
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,467
There's no telling what he'll try next,
which is obviously a problem.

365
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,929
Just report him.
That's why we pay all those taxes.

366
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,472
We can't involve the cops!

367
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,765
Why not?

368
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,268
We just can't.

369
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:29,440
Besides, they let stalkers off
with a slap on the wrist.

370
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,525
A suspended sentence is hardly punishment.

371
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:39,158
Why do you look out for In-ji so much
when you have your own problems?

372
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,162
I'm okay with me dying,

373
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:44,913
but I can't let In-ji die.

374
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,833
Cut the crap. What are you, a saint?

375
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,045
What the hell did that bastard do anyway?

376
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:55,883
That fucker Eom Tae-seong
is the reason In-ji's life's gone to shit.

377
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,010
If only you knew
what that bastard did to her…

378
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,513
It's complicated, okay?

379
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,190
Fucking hell.

380
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:16,612
I'll find this bastard, no matter what,
and when I do, I'll kill him.

381
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:52,356
It seems Eom Tae-seong's shown up.

382
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,534
-Thanks.
-No problem, sir. Go right ahead.

383
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:54,251
I thought right now would be perfect
to try this freshly brewed tea.

384
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,754
I guess you were meant to try it,
Mrs. Lee.

385
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,465
Right.

386
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,721
How's Jeong-won doing?

387
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,725
He seems to be doing well.

388
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,061
That would explain that look on your face.

389
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,982
I was the one
who arranged that marriage for him.

390
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:20,527
That seems like a test to me.

391
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:23,781
You want him all for yourself,
but he keeps eluding you.

392
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,950
You want to control every fiber of him,
but you just can't.

393
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,626
I'm not that twisted.

394
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:39,129
Of course you're not, Mrs. Lee.

395
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:45,093
Ma'am, the instructor
for our next gathering

396
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,262
is here to introduce himself.

397
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:33,827
Can I approach you?

398
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:36,788
No.

399
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:40,000
-Then why are you here?
-I came to see you.

400
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,628
But I guess I shouldn't have.

401
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:01,647
Just go away, please.
Leave. There's nothing to see here.

402
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,689
Get them out of here.

403
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:06,068
I'm sorry, but you can't be here.
Please leave. I'm sorry.

404
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:07,069
Please go.

405
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,453
Stop them from going in this way!

406
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,497
Seems like the chest wound
was the killing blow.

407
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,291
I wonder how many of them there are.

408
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:22,668
How many what?

409
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,544
Fish.

410
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:27,214
I'm sure there's a lot. All kinds, too.

411
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:31,426
Maybe it's because I quit smoking,
but man, I'm hungry.

412
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:36,139
There's a loach soup place that way,
and an entrail soup place right…

413
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,440
Not that way, sir. The other way.

414
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:58,870
<i>I actually fell asleep without meds.</i>
<i>On the sofa, no less.</i>

415
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:04,418
<i>No. He just fell asleep.</i>

416
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:16,555
Mr. Kim, I'm stopping by.
Please notify everyone.

417
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,998
I'm Lee Seo-yeon, Han Jeong-won's ex-wife.

418
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:44,624
I see.

419
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,752
I'm Noh In-ji.

420
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:56,261
-Can we try it two keys higher?
-Two keys higher it is.

421
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:11,818
Bro, why don't we call it a day
and you buy me a nice meal?

422
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:13,320
What do you say?

423
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,364
Next time. I don't think I can today.

424
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:17,908
Why not?

425
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:21,328
I'm eating at home.

426
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:34,091
I'm so sorry. My hand keeps slipping.

427
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,928
It's fine. I'll just go to the bathroom.

428
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:39,930
Sure.

429
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,806
NOH IN-JI

430
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:09,311
NOH IN-JI

431
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:10,979
DO YOU TRUST HER?

432
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,412
<i>The number you have dialed</i>
<i>is not in service.</i>

433
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,414
<i>Please check the number…</i>

434
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,089
<i>Do you trust her?</i>

435
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,218
What?

436
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,135
That woman.

437
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:44,387
The one Lee Seo-yeon set you up with.

438
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:47,682
Do you think she'll be on your side?

439
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,101
<i>Watch yourself.</i>

440
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,270
<i>Don't get stabbed in the back.</i>

441
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:07,410
So Ms. Noh In-ji
is the owner of the trunk?

442
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,247
Yes.

443
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,291
She carried it with her to every dispatch.

444
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,210
Dispatch?

445
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:16,628
Yes.

446
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:18,588
Where did she work?

447
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:24,135
I don't know the details.
I only know that she was dispatched often.

448
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:28,014
How can you not know
where your best friend worked?

449
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:32,811
Do you remember the leaked video
from the Blooming Hotel?

450
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:37,315
It was her marriage that was ruined
by that video.

451
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,859
She's never really opened up to me since.

452
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:46,992
Is that so?

453
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:05,844
I renovated the interior
when we moved into this house.

454
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,098
I changed everything except those lights.

455
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:14,477
I figured they suited the home nicely.

456
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:20,108
But I feel bad now given what's happened.

457
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:22,110
Please don't.

458
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:24,195
It was just an accident.

459
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,867
I ordered new lights from France.

460
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,287
At Jeong-won's request.

461
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:35,957
I see.

462
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,217
Let's drop this pretense.

463
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,095
I'm sure you have questions.

464
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:52,015
You know who I am, don't you?

465
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,146
Don't you recognize me?

466
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,283
Of course I do.

467
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,497
Lee Seo-yeon,
Architecture Department, senior year.

468
