THE TRUNK

00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,495
[man] This is your first time, huh?

4
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,540
FIVE YEARS AGO

5
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,625
You must be pretty desperate to do this.

6
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,836
Sorry, I'm just curious.

7
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,923
I mean, isn't marriage
supposed to be romantic? [chuckles]

8
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,092
It is overrated.

9
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,804
Still, there should be some attraction,
you know?

10
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,807
First, you do a little mating dance,
then you get together.

11
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,351
End of the day,
being married creates inertia.

12
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,187
And that's just all a wedding does.

13
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,521
Don't you think?

14
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:07,734
I always fucking hated
that sense of inertia.

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,614
Why is it such a big deal
to put two peoples' names on a document?

16
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,618
All it is is a reminder that
neither person can trust their partner.

17
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,372
Truth is, both of you know
it's not going to last.

18
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,293
It's just a trap.
An easy way to tie each other down.

19
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:27,712
And romance?

20
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,800
A contract isn't romantic, is it?

21
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,553
Do we need to certify romance at all?

22
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,390
Who cares? It's all bullshit, right?

23
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,065
So marriage is problematic for you?

24
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,148
[In-ji] Well, no.

25
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,068
Personally, I just...

26
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,863
I loathe it.

27
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,576
This wasn't a good idea.

28
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,121
I'm gonna go.

29
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,500
Listen, I'm dying.
I have six months left. Maybe four.

30
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,843
Obviously, you would be
my first and last wife.

31
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,345
If I said, "Let's get married..."

32
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,682

[Seo-yeon] You know who I am, right?

36
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,535
Yeah, I do.

37
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,538
And how do you know who I am?

38
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,541
Who cares, really?

39
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,802
I knew someone
who took their own life in school,

40
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,762
and I heard it might've been your fault.

41
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,766
What I heard is they committed suicide
to get away from you.

42
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,561
I must've been quite a bitch then, huh?

43
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,357
That's how I know you,
not that I really think of you like that.

44
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,902
Why do you say that?

45
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:18,072
I guess it's hard to know
what would drive anyone to

46
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,075
decide to take their own life like that.

47
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,538
But in most cases, any excuse will do.

48
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,335
Still, that doesn't mean

49
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,004
you're not a conniving, dishonest,
and self-interested shrew.

50
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,841
I do recall things

51
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,011
in those days, In-ji.

52
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,057
But the reason I remember you...

53
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,936
Well, I'll tell you a bit later.
How's that?

54
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,251
Don't get out. I have to get going.

55
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,336

It's weird hearing you say "our house."

59
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,054

but she actually went to our school.

that he's still alive and well?

Don't get me wrong. I like the money.

103

Do you wanna marry him again or something?

104
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,648
Or kill him and move on? That makes sense.

I can kind of make out their faces,

[music fades]

181
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,023
I've seen plenty of injuries and stuff,

182
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:02,151
but I don't think
I've ever seen healing up close.

183
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,614
Why do I feel...

184
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,493
I won't be able to get this image
of that cut out of my head

185
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,745
until you're healed?

186
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,085
Obviously, you're stoic.

187
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,087
Could you at least try to cry?

188
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,633
I think I'd be more at ease
with everything.

189
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,230
[In-ji] What are you doing Tuesday?

190
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,028
Pretty sure I'm open.
We could have a quick wedding.

191
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,448

192
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,997
[electronic music continues]

193
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,501
NO RECENT MISSED CALLS

194
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,048
[Jeong-won] <i>Sorry, I'm busy right now.
I'll call you later, okay?</i>

195
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,724
[music fades]

196
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,370
[Yoon-a] Ugh, what is all this?
You guys were stuffing your faces.

197
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,020
[boy 1] I ate too much.

198
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,041
Guys, we talked about this.
You're not to eat snacks at night.

199
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,650
All right. Brush your teeth.

200
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,610
- No horsing around.
- Got ya!

201
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,320
- Hey, stop messing around!
- Hey!

202
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,410
[moans] Uh, my mom texted me yesterday.

203
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,412
About those rice cakes...

204
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,208
[Yoon-a] Why the... hell did I get married?

205
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,003
Well, because I was...

206
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,421
[yawns]

207
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,715
...basically the best in our W&L class?

208
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,718
I was always the normal one,
but now I have the most screwed-up life.

209
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,052
I don't get it.

210
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,804
You need cash, Yoon-a?

211
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,140
Keep it under two million won.

212
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,437
Jeong-won's new wife. What's her name?

213
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,064
- Why?
- I'd like to be her friend.

214
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,983
- What?
- I've got nothing else.

215
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,444
I don't have a career.
My husband's not exactly rich.

216
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,087
There's no way I'm inheriting anything.

217
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,472
I'm living with a business owner
who barely makes ends meet.

218
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,033
All I have is my friends!

219
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,497
[pensive music playing]

220
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,094
[In-ji] <i>It's standard procedure.
From the manual.</i>

[sighs]

225
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,195
The manual.

00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,450
Dude, uh, Yoon-a said...

229
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,118
[Jeong-won] You need a new car, right?

230
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,954
I'll get you one,
but I need your help tomorrow.

231
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,083
What for? Oh my God. Are you in trouble?

232
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,126
I need a witness

233
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,296
'cause In-ji and I are getting married.

234
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,883
I thought you guys weren't gonna have
a wedding. Wait, I'm the witness?

235
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,261
Three o'clock.
They'll send a formal invite.

236
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,887
Who? Uh...

237
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,311
[light jazz music playing]

238
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,028
How's your wife's injury doing?

239
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,449
Doing really well.
They removed her stitches.

240
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,576
The doctor said it's healing fast.

241
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,038
Although to be honest,
she might be stifling the pain.

242
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,041
And you took her to the doctor?

243
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,920
Well, yeah. You didn't know that?

244
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,009
It was all my fault.

245
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,847
It's nice that...

246
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,632
[chuckles]...the two of you
are getting along so well.

247
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,401
OH SE-EUN
OUR LOVER/THE ORPHAN/YOU

248
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,211
Just a little keepsake
to commemorate our worst moment.

249
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,715
How's it make you feel now?

250
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,557

[pensive music playing]

252
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,978
You're being cruel.

253
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:49,854
How could you?

254
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,275
I don't want you to take them. Got it?

255
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,279
Just fight the urge.

256
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,328
I'll do whatever you say.

257
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,457
Our wedding is tomorrow.

00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,757

PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING RULES

[scoffs]

263
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,902
It's a list of demands,
not... a wedding invite.

[sighs]

267
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,074
How the hell do you put these things on?

268
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,842
You know, I could've been undressed.

269
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:45,387
If you weren't dressed by now,
it'd probably mean you're running away.

270
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,432
I thought about it, actually.

271
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,600
I never thought I'd be doing this again.

272
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,646
Technically, we should've been married
after our first week together.

273
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,648
We had to wait 'cause of the accident.

274
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,277
Well, I mean, the manual says that.

275
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,488
I thought I wouldn't have to deal with
formalities. Guess I was wrong.

276
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,784
[gentle synth music playing]

277
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,298
You're, uh, quite proficient.

278
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,841
I have a way with things.

279
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,890
My grandmother... said
I always had an eye for detail.

280
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:35,187
She said those kinds of people
end up doing the work other people avoid.

281
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,440
Guess I'm destined
for heartbreak and loneliness.

282
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,567
You think?

283
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,446
Uh, no.

284
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,200
You know, I was gonna wear this suit
at the funeral.

285
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,997
I knew that's what it was for.

286
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:58,001
After all, this is your only black suit,
and you never wear suits anyway.

287
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,130
I figured it was all part of the fact that
you're waiting for your father to die.

288
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,677
Just think of this as
signing a one-year insurance contract.

289
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,764
You just might have to pay a penalty
if you cancel.

290
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,433
One year?

291
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,358
Let's go.

292
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,155
[door opens]

293
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,908

[electronic music playing]

296
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,543
[man 1] Can I see the plans?

297
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,423
Perfect. Okay, so the space
you're looking at now is the library.

298
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,258
And over here, this is...

299
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:49,302
[Jeong-won] <i>It's not too late.
Just say the word, and I'll call it off.</i>

300
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,972
[man 2] So even at night,
it should have good natural light.

301
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,725
[man 1] Mm, the skylight is huge.
It's in a good spot.

302
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,228
As for the lights, they'll go here.

303
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,355
[Seon] The purpose of this ceremony

304
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,775
is to confirm and ratify the contract
between the two of you.

305
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,903
The contract stipulates
total confidentiality

306
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:10,073
between Mr. Han Jeong-won,
Ms. Noh In-ji, and NM.

307
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,286
Legally, this marriage requires
no obligations.

308
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:17,164
No duties. No records will be kept.

309
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,458
In the case of a breach of contract,

310
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,294
as stated
in your initial agreement with NM,

311
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:25,172
either party
may potentially be subject to liability.

312
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,300
Your contract will last one year.

313
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:31,470
But if both parties agree,
you can extend the marriage.

314
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,391
In the case of one party objecting,
the contract will be terminated for both.

315
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,475
And you

316
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,604
will never be allowed to... to speak again.

317
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,773
As soon as you sign the contract,

318
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,734
your marriage will begin.

319
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,176
Mr. Han Jeong-won and Ms. Noh In-ji,

320
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:14,095
you're now married legally
per your contract with NM.

321
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,099
I'm honored to share this moment with you.
I wish you the best.

324
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,548

00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,247
<i>They need to make this count.</i>

326
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,625
[commentator 2] <i>Oh, he's just gone
over the bar with that one though.</i>

327
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,002
<i>I'll tell you what.
That was a really, really good shot.</i>

328
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,003
<i>It was from distance.</i>

329
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,674
<i>Not the easiest to get that...
get that up and in there, but...</i>

330
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,986
[commentator 1] <i>Ealing should've been able
to get it in there, but he was too slow.</i>

331
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,972
[commentator 2] <i>Looking back on it,
he should've done better with that.</i>

332
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,295
[commentator 1] <i>Oh, that's off.</i>

333
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,559
<i>Tipped forward,
the center back headed it out,</i>

334
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:04,521
<i>and now they're looking to go and build
some play from the right-hand side.</i>

335
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,505
[commentator 2] They do have width.

336
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,025
<i>They have good width
on that right-hand side...</i>

337
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,402
What did you do before this?

338
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,488
Uh, I'm not allowed to tell you that.

339
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:15,907
Oh, you're not?

340
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,452
Those lawyers must be incredible.

341
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,789
I bet they could show up in a courtroom
and prove that Messi plays tennis.

342
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,460
Why do other people do this anyway?

343
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:31,715
Did you... ever think about asking why
your other husbands were doing this?

344
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:35,135
[commentator 2] <i>He shoots!
And a great save there!</i>

345
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,818
[Jeong-won] I've been thinking about it.

346
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:41,308
And I can see how, if you were lonely
or terminally ill and dying,

347
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,184
you might wanna give this a whirl.

348
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,146
It's still a fake marriage though.
Does it mean anything?

349
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,941
People work so hard not to look lonely.

350
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,694
They're even willing
to cling to a fake marriage.

351
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:57,115
You can still be lonely,
even if you're with someone.

352
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,659
They know that and get used to it.

353
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,746
Separation anxiety. You become dependent.

354
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,957
Isn't that the reason
you got married, at least?

355
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,921
You became dependent.
Like separation anxiety.

356
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,091
You knew perfectly well
that you'd still be lonely.

[wistful piano music playing]

358
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,641
Well, good night.

359
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,143
By the way,

360
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,313
we just kicked off our honeymoon, I guess.

<i>I'm not so sure
they're really playing all out...</i>

364
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,119
IT'S NOT TOO LATE IF YOU STOP ME NOW
I WON'T GO THROUGH WITH IT

[In-ji] Were you drowning?

Is that what you were dreaming about?

376
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,020
Just the usual.

377
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,524
[In-ji] Try not to worry.

378
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,694

385
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,061
Forget it.

386
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,064
I think it was sleep paralysis.

387
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,068
In case you wondered, it was all real.
I was by your bedside.

[coughs]

389
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:51,576

401
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,379

My life's a train wreck as it is.

So talk to my wife and find out
how much of this I need to take

406
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,312
before she's satisfied.

407
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,275
I wanted to let the year pass by quietly.
I told you.

I don't get why that's so hard for you!

- Why are you so upset right now?
- Upset?!

I don't wanna care about this or you!

I wanna go back to how things were!
I can't do this anymore!

412

You mean
that you feel strongly about this?

413
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,331
I do!

414
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:23,834
I understand.

415
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,381
I mean, we can

416
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,634

00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,084
By the way, your kimchi went bad
and wilted. I threw it out.

I just winged this batch,
but goddamn, it's amazing.

No one's gonna eat this food.

456

not to mess with this place
till you move out.

461
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:31,480
The two of you are driving me up the wall
with this nonsense.

[In-ji] Have some stew, okay?

463
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:37,069
- But you didn't.
- I'll get a bite at the office.

464
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,324
It's your loss.
This kimchi is pretty good.

[Tae-seong] Now we're gonna
make these flowers bloom. Follow along.

Like so. You see? Have fun. Be creative.

472
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,065
All right.

473
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,275
Now we'll hold the bottom portion

of the finished flower
with the flower scissors like this

475
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,699
and then slowly remove it from the nail.

476
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,369
Then you find the perfect spot, and...

477
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,373
and there you have it.

478
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,167
Give it a whirl.

It's just a bunch of tricks.

483
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,264
He's not really employing
traditional techniques.

484
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,433
[Yoon-a] Well, traditions change
over time, don't they?

485
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,103
Oh, by the way,
do you have your new lights?

486
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,647
I would love to come check them out.

Um, I don't know.
I don't really get to decide that.

Well, I will take that as a yes.

- [woman 2] That was great.

I'll be looking forward to the next class.

493
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,138

- [woman 1] Bye.

Oh.

00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,098
His entire family is...

497
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:32,435
They're really particular,
so it needs to be perfect, or I'll be...

498
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,562
I'll be on the chopping block
if it goes wrong.

It's an older man's name.

Oh, they're for
my father-in-law's birthday.

Not too excited
to deal with your in-laws, huh?

Don't you worry.

505
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,412
I'll make sure they say,

506

"Well, this is going all wrong,

507
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,667

[man 1 sighs] How'd I get a case
about a 50-million-won piece of luggage?

514
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:25,696
I got a feeling we're gonna be banging
our heads against the wall with this one.

515
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,325
Fingerprints?

516
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,286
It was underwater,
so it's gonna take a while to know.

517
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,626
Man, what happened?

518
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,171
There's a lot going on out here,

00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,256
but it's sort of dead too.

520
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,301
It's too clean, like it's been scoured.

521
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,054
[man 1] What do you mean?

522
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,933
I dunno, man. [grunts]

523
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,476
[phone buzzing]

524
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:00,606
[man 1] Hello?

525
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,692
They know who owned the trunk.

526
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,451
<i>You must have
a whole bunch of these at home</i>

527
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,621
<i>since you didn't notice
this</i> 50-<i>million-won trunk was gone.</i>

528
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,418
Although we know you didn't use it.

529
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,631
When we found the body,
we found this thing with it.

530
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:35,641
So how are you related
to the owner of the trunk to my left?

531
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,186
I'm her husband.

532
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,023
And my wife used to use it.

533
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,736
Okay, which wife?

534
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,241
[pensive music playing]

535
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,832
You don't have to be here
since I'm around. It's about to get dusty.

536
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,674
[door opens]

537
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,473
[phone buzzing]

538
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:22,229
[In-yeong] <i>Word is,
he's looking for a house in Budapest.</i>

539
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,902
<i>I think he's planning to settle down.</i>

540
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,572
[footsteps approaching]

541
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,539
So I'd like to take
the chandelier with me today.

542
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,680
- If that's okay with...
- Sure, go ahead.

543
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,085
You know it's really rare, right?

544
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,505
So you might wanna
talk this over with Jeong-won...

545
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:51,800
Your husband.
Sorry, I forgot that's who he is to you.

546
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,887
Well, you must know about
the nightmares that thing caused.

547
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,349
Clearly, we needed to get rid of it.
We both agreed on it.

548
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,431
We should have dinner together
with our spouses soon.

549
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:07,107
Now that the lights are taken care of
and the two of you are officially married,

550
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,359
we should celebrate.

551
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,986
You... <i>We</i> don't have to if it's awkward.

552
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,073
We'd be delighted. I'm glad you asked.

553
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,908
How about next Wednesday, then?

554
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,702
Yeah. That sounds good.

555
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,288
[footsteps approaching]

556
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,372
[Yoon-a] Oh hey!

557
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,209
This is where you're hiding!

558
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,923
My husband has told me so much about you.

559
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,967
Sorry. Kang Yoon-a.

560
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:34,968
Hi.

[music fades]

563
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:48,107
She seems really classy.
Super easygoing. She's not a loudmouth.

564
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,318
That's a relief. I mean,
I was worried she was gonna be a lunatic.

565
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:55,239
I guess Jeong-won's got pretty good taste
in women, after all, doesn't he?

566
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,701
Hey, are you doing okay?

567
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,327
So good.

568
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,705
Jeong-won deserves to be happy too.

569

[footsteps approaching]

570
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:16,135
[In-ji] We're going to have
Seo-yeon and her husband over for dinner.

571
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,266
Are you guys friends?

572
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,977
Well, she helped out with the chandelier.

573
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,812
So I agreed to it.

574
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,290
[sentimental music playing]

575
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,860
[In-ji] I was just going to sell it
to the scrapyard for 3,000 won.

576
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,280
Then she offered to take it off our hands.

577
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,408
3,000? That thing's worth 30 million.

578
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,620
I didn't want us to remember it
as something valuable.

579
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,998
So I thought we should treat it
like a worthless piece of junk

580
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,084
and watch it get melted down
little by little

581
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,543
until there's nothing left.

582
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:36,131
Now I bet it's gonna be around
for a while. It's frustrating.

583
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:39,968
[Jeong-won sighs]

584
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,516
Seriously, before you started this,
what did you do?

585
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,686
A lot of things.

586
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,855
Okay, tell me about one.

587
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,651
I taught dance lessons for a while.

588
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:58,821
Tango, waltz, all that jazz.

589
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,281
Did you teach milonga?

590
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,787
There was a recording I heard in the car.

591
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,333
Where do you go in the morning?

592
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,587
I exercise.

593
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,589
What do you do?

594
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:22,761
Kayaking.

595
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,306
When I'm out there alone in the morning,

596
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,143
I feel like an island floating on a lake.

597
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:32,855
You're pretty active.

598
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,736
[In-ji] I tried to improve
our sleeping arrangement.

599
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,864
Think of this as a peaceful little island.

What are you doing here?

606
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,974
I wanna see the bedroom of our newlyweds.

607
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,227
What are you hoping to see?

608
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:58,440
It smells so different now.
I think it's that diffuser.

609
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,025
Is it bergamot?

610
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,152
We really like the new lights.

611
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:03,779
Thank you.

612
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,490
Great. Did you give them a good look?

I would've never been able
to serve something like this.

Now that I'm a guest,
I finally get to try it.

I'm sorry. It's so funny. [laughs]

Please go ahead.

I made it right away.

How about that?

636
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:22,542
I figured you'd like them, actually.

You've got something here, honey.

640
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,157
So, Jeong-won, when did you meet Seo-yeon?

641
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:58,912
It was about 30 years ago.

642
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,789
Mm-hmm. That's right.

643
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:02,332
Wow.

644
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,794
And yet you were only actually married
about two years.

645
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:10,048
Guess even 30 years of build-up
can't save a marriage

646

if it's not a good fit.

647
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:19,725

to find the right person.

Are you just gonna sit here and pretend?

651
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:40,203
How about you? Before you got married,
how long did you date?

652
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:42,329
So...

653
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,001
that didn't really affect us since we...

654
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,882
had so much chemistry right away.

655
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,260

00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,677
[dishes clattering]

695
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,886
[music fades]

696
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,398
[dishes clatter]

697
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,130
Have you seen
the USB drive I keep in the car?

698
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,213
I can't find it.

699
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,015
Bluetooth's not your thing, huh?

700
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,767
I guess I don't leave a trace or a name.

701
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,106
You don't use Bluetooth either.

702
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,527
I've always used USB to store my work.

703
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:25,655
No security issues,
and Bluetooth's a hassle.

704
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:28,950
I'll reconnect your drive.

705
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:31,870
That song just never gets old.

706
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,166
And you actually dance to that song?

707
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,460
Tango?

708
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:45,592
Sorry. It's just hard to understand how...

709
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,302
I thought you'd hate that stuff.

710
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,966
I mean, it's hard to picture you dancing.
That's all.

711
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:58,730
Oh, I'm sorry. That sounded harsh.

712
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:05,195
I bet it would blow you away.
If only I could show you.

713
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,717
[milonga music playing]

714
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,229
Okay, would you mind showing me?

715
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,006
What's this?

716
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,426
It takes two to tango, obviously.

717
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:10,969
Uh, no, no, no, no.

718
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:12,554
Uh...

719
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,222
[breathes shakily]

720
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:16,433
Your right hand rests on the woman's back,

721
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:20,937
and your left hand should always
support the woman's right hand.

722
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,106
Uh, do we really have to...

723
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:26,609
Now we shift our center of gravity
one step after another.

724
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:33,658
As you take each step,
try not to go by yourself.

725
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:35,618
Imagine carrying the other person with you

726
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,204
so our bodies can transition
through the space.

727
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,832
[milonga music continues]

728
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:42,584
[laughs]

729
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:45,211
Now move forward on your right foot
two steps. That's it.

730
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,546
Right foot. Oh!

731
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:47,714
[Jeong-won laughs]

732
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:49,549
[In-ji laughs]

733
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:51,009
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

734
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:54,971
Starting with your right foot,
take a step forward.

735
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:56,930
Left foot.

736
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:59,100
Right foot sidesteps.

737
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:04,063
We're shifting our center. And step right.

738
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:06,900
- Oh! [chuckles]
- [Jeong-won] Oh!

739
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:10,820
Try again.

740
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:23,249
[milonga music continues]

741
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,232
[music fades]

742
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:51,152
[unsettling music playing]

743
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,709
[music fades]

744
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,795
[ethereal music playing]

745
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:28,565
[music swells]

746
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,525
[music stops]

747
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,610
[milonga music resumes]

748
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,112
[music fades]
