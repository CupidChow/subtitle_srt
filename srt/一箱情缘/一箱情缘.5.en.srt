1
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,950
THE TRUNK

2
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,077
<i>I saw Eom Tae-seong near your house.</i>

3
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,037
<i>Shall I get you an air gun?</i>

4
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,737
My mom gave it to me as a kid
so I wouldn't have nightmares.

5
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,618
You seemed to be having a bad dream.
What was it about?

6
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,999
I don't remember.

7
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,419
Not many people remember their dreams.

8
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:53,965
I didn't know that.

9
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,301
My dreams are always so vivid.

10
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,556
I was told we all come from water,

11
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,141
so dying isn't really dying,

12
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,101
it's more like taking a break.

13
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,645
That helped me sleep for a while.

14
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,983
But it started giving me nightmares
after my mom passed.

15
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,446
What nightmare was so vivid
that you thought you needed this?

16
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,529
There are several.

17
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,992
In one,
I dissolve like ice on a crowded street.

18
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,747
I scream, but no one can hear my voice.

19
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,459
I'm alone, dying until

20
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,295
I wake up.

21
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,632
What's wrong with dying alone?

22
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,220
Who says dying alone can't be peaceful?

23
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,392
Humans are fundamentally alone,
but we forget because we're afraid.

24
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,771
Arguing otherwise won't change that.

25
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,941
Once you accept it,
it stops being so overwhelming.

26
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,652
If we weren't fundamentally alone,

27
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,821
how could we ever truly love
someone else?

28
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,620
So you've been in love before.

29
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,585
What happens in your nightmares?

30
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,129
I don't have dreams...

31
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,382
Is it about Eom Tae-seong?

32
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,594
Who is Eom Tae-seong?

33
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,472
Is he so dangerous
that you need an air gun?

34
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,273
He's my stalker.

35
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,110
He's been following me for five years.

36
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,571
He could even be watching us right now
from outside.

37
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,949
Did you report him to the police?

38
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,869
Of course you did.

39
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,498
Then how can I help?

40
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:53,334
Don't do anything, as per the manual.

41
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,171
Eom Tae-seong is my problem.

42
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,757
He has nothing to do with this marriage.

43
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,385
It's none of your concern.

44
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,149
I'm meeting a new client,
so it shouldn't take too long.

45
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,192
<i>I'll call when I'm nearby.</i>

46
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,361
Didn't you say you had plans?
You don't have to.

47
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,613
<i>I'll see how things go here.</i>

48
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,783
Just take some time off.
I'm tired and want to get home early.

49
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,287
<i>Second floor.</i>

50
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,374
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

51
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:44,844
Ms. Lee Seo-yeon?

52
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:53,770
I'm Eom Tae-seong.

53
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,856
We met before, at the Heritage Lounge.

54
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,610
Well,

55
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,030
I can't quite place you.

56
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,325
That's okay.
We were never formally introduced.

57
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:10,787
His makeshift methods may stir curiosity,
but they're far from traditional.

58
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,459
Please take a seat.

59
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:28,221
So you're considering a five-story
traditional workshop and gallery.

60
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,473
Here are some samples
for you to look over.

61
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:32,682
Unusual, right?

62
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,980
I wore them when I was doing time,
but I still put them on sometimes.

63
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,566
I find them oddly comforting.

64
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,778
You seemed curious

65
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,615
about my sneakers.

66
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,123
I'm not that interested
in other people's private lives.

67
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,125
You seemed quite interested.

68
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,836
I don't know what you're...

69
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,045
Noh In-ji.

70
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,301
Why are you so interested in Noh In-ji,

71
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,262
you fucking bitch?

72
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,067
I don't hate bitches like you,

73
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,862
but that changes
if you do anything to In-ji.

74
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,655
She's off-limits.

75
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,536
Do you catch my drift?

76
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,258
If you're wondering who I am,

77
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,219
try asking NM.

78
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,057
And ask what might happen to you
if you keep getting on my nerves.

79
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,688
Please

80
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,192
email me those samples,

81
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,069
Ms. Lee Seo-yeon.

82
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,802
Did something happen to you last night?

83
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,387
You weren't replying to my texts.

84
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,348
I went to bed early.

85
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,187
I guarantee that bastard Eom Tae-seong
is going to come find you soon.

86
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,648
Did you see the photo I sent you?

87
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:30,903
Let me know if you need anything.
Guns, grenades, I'll get you whatever.

88
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,826
Just say the word, and I'll do it.

89
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:37,909
I mean it.

90
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,122
I'll kill that bastard without hesitation.

91
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,875
If anyone kills him, it'll be me.

92
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,835
I'll do it.

93
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,754
Si-jeong.

94
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,091
Why don't you date?

95
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,346
What's the point?

96
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,602
I don't have much capacity
for happiness left.

97
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,520
Dating takes too much effort.

98
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,649
The math is simple.
The chances of misery are too high.

99
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,902
I thought I'd never see you again
after Hye-yeong died.

100
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,113
Why are you still so good to me?

101
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,743
We started as three friends.

102
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,787
Now it's just the two of us,
so this is what we do.

103
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,344
Please look into Lee Seo-yeon for me.

104
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,971
She's Mr. Han Jeong-won's ex-wife.

105
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,474
Find her drug source.

106
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,266
She's a junkie?

107
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,687
I think she's a supplier.
A malicious one at that.

108
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,279
<i>I'm not gonna make it.</i>

109
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,074
I'm with some former colleagues

110
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,368
I haven't seen in forever.

111
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,664
I was heading home anyway.

112
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,540
<i>See you at home, then.</i>

113
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,684
He gave a lecture at the Heritage Lounge.

114
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:29,438
He was a young, decent-looking man
who was good at what he did.

115
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,691
Word about him spread quickly.

116
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,112
Did you see him meet Noh In-ji
at the Heritage Lounge?

117
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,489
You mean Mr. Han Jeong-won's wife?

118
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,782
<i>No.</i>

119
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,452
<i>If anything, he seemed to know Seo-yeon.</i>

120
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,662
<i>Ms. Lee Seo-yeon?</i>

121
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,539
Yes.

122
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,001
I saw the two of them meet.

123
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:54,964
Lee Seo-yeon?

124
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,051
I thought I saw you
back at the restaurant.

125
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,470
I was there for a parent-teacher meeting.

126
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,056
It's lucky we bumped into each other.

127
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,853
Damn menstrual cramps.

128
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,897
The meds I've taken should help.

129
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,816
I'm so jealous of you.

130
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:19,989
If our lives were skin undertones,
mine would be ashy.

131
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,657
My life's an ashy gray.

132
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,578
At least you have your kids.

133
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,205
I'd get rid of them if I could.

134
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,920
If I could,
I'd stuff them back into my womb.

135
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,131
Nothing ever goes my way.

136
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,550
It's like their umbilical cords
are still attached.

137
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,845
At least things were peaceful
when they were in my womb.

138
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,054
Ever since I got married,

139
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,348
it feels like I've grown
30 or so umbilical cords.

140
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:51,604
I feel like an alien parasite host
from one of those sci-fi movies.

141
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,356
If it's that bad, why not get a divorce?

142
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,859
We hold hands when we shop for groceries.

143
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,570
I wouldn't want to lose that.

144
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,575
Why did you meet with Mr. Eom Tae-seong?

145
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,664
I saw you together.

146
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,167
The guy who uses rice cakes
to create works of art.

147
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,004
We had some on the day
Mr. Han's light was replaced, remember?

148
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,634
<i>Oh my! Here you both are.</i>

149
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,422
Why are <i>you</i> here?

150
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,008
That's what you want to know?

151
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,221
I thought you'd be more curious
about how you ended up here.

152
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,522
Any later and you'd have needed
a hysterectomy.

153
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,567
Thankfully, they only had to remove
one of your ovaries.

154
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:24,280
The other one's not looking great,
so you'll need routine treatment.

155
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,867
There's a call button.

156
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,412
Now that you're awake,
I'll call the nurse on my way out.

157
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,622
Ms. Yoon-a was driving me.

158
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,041
Where is she?

159
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,669
Her kids get back from camp today,

160
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,005
so she asked me to stay with you instead.

161
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,674
Yoon-a may be slow
to pick up on social cues,

162
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:47,011
but she's not so slow
that she would have asked you here.

163
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:53,309
Mr. Han Jeong-won left his phone at home,
so I answered it.

164
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,229
He wasn't in his studio,
so I had no way to contact him.

165
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,900
Mr. Yoon Ji-o had to step out for a bit,

166
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,278
in case you were wondering.

167
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:08,991
You appear to be taking pleasure
in learning so much about me.

168
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,660
Did you take pleasure
finding out a lot about me?

169
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,418
What do you mean?

170
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:25,215
I figured you probably know
a whole lot more about me.

171
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,930
At the very least,
you'll have seen my resume.

172
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,975
You'll have seen from my resume

173
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,519
that this marriage will not fail.

174
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,190
So, did you sleep with Jeong-won
or something?

175
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,742
What are you doing?

176
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,411
Your urinary catheter fell out.

177
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,455
NURSE CALL

178
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,292
I guess that's why they said
someone should be by your side.

179
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:20,062
<i>- Spin around like this?
- That's it.</i>

180
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,897
<i>- Lower me down.
- Go low.</i>

181
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:41,684
Jeong-won?

182
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,146
Jeong-won!

183
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,359
Why the hell weren't you answering
your phone?

184
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,237
Pack up. We need to go.

185
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,416
She's dressed. You can go in.

186
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,058
Are you all right?

187
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,187
They told me to remove the IUD,
but I refused.

188
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,773
I didn't want to get pregnant again.

189
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,234
I should have listened to the doctor,

190
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,862
but you know me, I never listen.

191
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,615
You had other options, so why?

192
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,992
The other options
weren't reassuring enough.

193
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,454
I almost had to get a hysterectomy,

194
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,166
but it didn't quite come to that,
so I guess I have to keep menstruating.

195
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,835
Not that it matters.

196
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,838
The chances of me getting pregnant
have gone down now.

197
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,215
Seo-yeon.

198
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,593
Would you really want

199
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,429
to have another baby?

200
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:08,772
Your guardian desperately pleaded with us.

201
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,066
You're someone...

202
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,612
who should never have a child.

203
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,951
You know why, don't you?

204
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,717
OPERATION AND ANESTHESIA CONSENT FORM

205
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,598
Doctor.

206
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,517
The child.

207
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,229
Please save the child first.

208
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,722
Well, fuck me. They're still alive.

209
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,391
Mr. Eom Tae-seong?

210
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,145
So it is you.

211
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,037
What are you doing?

212
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,999
Casting light over the shadows.

213
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,123
You said accepting such things
lessens their impact.

214
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,366
What do you do for a living?

215
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,576
I make rice cakes.

216
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,788
I served as an apprentice
under a master of the craft.

217
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:15,542
Had I stayed with him, who knows?
I might have been the next master.

218
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,628
But he beat me more than I could bear.

219
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,350
I noticed...

220
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,230
that you have no cameras
watching over this grand house.

221
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,359
Perhaps you have many secrets.

222
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,571
Or maybe you have a phobia of cameras.

223
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,608
The tea is delicious, truly.

224
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,946
Isn't she also a fantastic cook?
She was a star student in my classes.

225
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:29,949
She's amazing.

226
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,872
I'll bring some rice cakes next time.

227
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,250
Ones made from apricots,

228
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,669
powdered with short-grain rice,
and steamed...

229
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,296
The old man's specialty.

230
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,634
When I was learning to make them,
he would whip my ass until it was blue.

231
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,052
That's how delicious

232
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,387
they are.

233
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:01,772
Do you smoke?

234
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,102
I'm rather rich.

235
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:47,694
I'm suddenly curious what it would be like
if I used my money to ruin your life.

236
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,780
I've thought of several ways.

237
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,533
I've got one obvious solution,

238
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,328
but I'm trying this first.

239
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,206
By that,
I mean meeting and talking to you.

240
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,377
Just stay away from Noh In-ji.

241
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,214
Then I won't have to use any money.

242
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:16,389
Rich people never blow money
without a reason.

243
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,560
What is she to you, Mr. Han Jeong-won?

244
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:22,811
What's your motive?

245
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:28,485
Do you feel Noh In-ji's become
your real wife or something?

246
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,825
Stay away from Noh In-ji.

247
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,537
You don't know Noh In-ji.

248
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,751
Noh In-ji. Do you trust her?

249
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,550
NOH IN-JI
DO YOU TRUST HER?

250
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,553
You even texted me.

251
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,388
Mr. Han Jeong-won.

252
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,099
Han Jeong-won.

253
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,603
Mr. Producer!

254
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,650
How do you plan on ruining a life
that's already ruined?

255
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,068
Do you think it'll work?

256
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:13,071
Someone who can't even picture
what it's like to be poor,

257
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:17,117
that's the kind of person
the world would love to see brought down.

258
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,827
You fucking idiot.

259
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,957
You goddamn psycho.

260
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,545
Do you think Noh In-ji will love you?

261
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,588
Do you really?

262
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,841
Do you seriously believe that?

263
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,468
But does Noh In-ji know?

264
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,473
That you killed your own mom.

265
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,809
You son of a...

266
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,067
You fucking lunatic.

267
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,297
People set off a lot of fireworks
around here,

268
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,675
so folks in the area
don't pay much attention to loud noises.

269
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,720
Besides, it rained heavily
in the early morning, so not much remains.

270
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,305
Drink up.

271
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,184
What about the stab wound in the thigh?

272
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,228
It's not a fresh wound.

273
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,398
He didn't go to the hospital.

274
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,651
He just put on some medical adhesive
from a pharmacy.

275
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,699
That's bad coffee.

276
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:04,808
He left.

277
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,901
Today's been a really long day.

278
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,935
<i>I wanted to have a child.</i>

279
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,397
<i>That way,</i>

280
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,734
I would no longer have to live
as somebody's son.

281
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,488
From that point onward,
I could simply live as a father.

282
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,200
But things didn't work out.

283
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,577
Why not?

284
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,415
I don't think she ever wanted a kid.

285
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,793
Maybe it was just something I wanted.

286
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,264
<i>It was my fault.</i>

287
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,018
<i>People say it was an accident,</i>

288
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,146
that she collapsed from nausea.

289
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,899
That's what Seo-yeon told the doctor.

290
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,529
A mom-to-be who's eight months pregnant.

291
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,991
A mother intimately aware
of her baby's every movement...

292
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,289
walked straight out into traffic.

293
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,875
How do you explain something like that?

294
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,429
Have you heard of the blue pill?

295
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,642
There's a blue pill and a red pill.

296
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:57,939
Taking the blue pill lets you see
and believe things the way you want to.

297
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,608
Every day you live in comfort

298
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,778
in a world that's just an illusion.

299
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,491
And the red pill?

300
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,328
It lets you break free
from the blue pill's illusions

301
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,039
and face the painful reality.

302
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,504
I think that was the first time...

303
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,259
that I wanted to get away from Seo-yeon.

304
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:32,515
I wished the baby had survived
instead of Seo-yeon.

305
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,518
And she found out?

306
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,901
I don't know why I felt that way.

307
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,404
You're pretending not to know.

308
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,868
You didn't want to save a life that day.

309
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,871
You wished another's life would end.

310
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:59,709
<i>Noh In-ji learned jujitsu
because of Eom Tae-seong.</i>

311
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,795
We had him committed to a mental hospital,

312
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,715
but he got out too soon.

313
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,884
I assumed
he'd just been released from prison.

314
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,219
He was wearing sneakers.

315
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:14,682
The ones that you see
prisoners wearing on the news.

316
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,144
Assault, attempted murder, and robbery.

317
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,940
He had plenty of other priors already.

318
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,860
What do you mean you had him committed?

319
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,197
Four years ago,

320
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,867
Eom Tae-seong snapped
an NM employee's neck in front of me.

321
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,501
I tried going to the cops countless times.

322
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,712
I even wore a location-tracking watch.

323
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:50,385
But there was little they could do for me
until I was injured or dead.

324
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,429
I'll ramp up our security detail,
so don't worry.

325
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,600
Eom Tae-seong snapped the neck
of an NM security officer.

326
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,477
We call them keepers.

327
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,187
Damn it.

328
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,607
The fuck are you looking at?

329
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,777
What is it, huh?

330
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:14,784
<i>They're usually ex-special forces,
ex-presidential guards,</i>

331
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,995
or former professional athletes.

332
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:22,583
Eom Tae-seong is more of a danger
to those around me than to me.

333
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,588
He always finds a way
to stake a claim over me.

334
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:34,220
He believes that's how he can dominate me.

335
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,270
Our company dealt with it discreetly.

336
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:47,233
We reached a settlement with the bereaved
and had Eom committed to an institute.

337
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,193
How can we put him back there?

338
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,157
If we were to get involved again,
he would turn himself in.

339
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:57,201
If that were to happen,

340
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,496
I'd have a lot of explaining to do
to the police.

341
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,165
And in the process,

342
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:07,211
the world would come to know
of NM's existence.

343
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,466
He told me to ask NM

344
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,719
what would happen to me.

345
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,141
I suggest you either stop
what you were doing...

346
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,312
or pick up jujitsu.

347
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,256
He shamed me constantly.

348
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,468
Said our marriage
wasn't good for the company.

349
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,971
Of all the people I've met in life,

350
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,767
he ranks among
the top five most abhorrent.

351
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,647
For someone so cruel,
he sure looks peaceful.

352
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:11,817
You're right.

353
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:16,781
What are you doing?

354
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:20,201
It's not like he can feel it.
I'm the one who's stuck feeling like shit.

355
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,341
It's a temporary reaction.

356
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,927
It's not like he's conscious.

357
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,555
Seo-yeon found him like this.

358
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:45,351
She was hospitalized
and dropped by to see him, apparently.

359
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:51,315
He hasn't got long left.
You should prepare for the worst.

360
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,617
This is the first time
I've looked into his eyes

361
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,327
in so long.

362
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,861
This is for you to change into, sir.

363
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:24,075
- Did the person who gave it to you leave?
- Yes, they dropped it off and left.

364
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,588
- Right, I understand.
- Thank you.

365
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,635
Please leave those two here
next to this column.

366
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,139
I think we're a bit early.

367
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,185
Why's the daughter-in-law
nowhere to be seen?

368
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,563
- Do you think Seo-yeon will come?
- Why would she?

369
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,691
Well, he was her father-in-law...

370
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,987
Honey, what's she doing wearing that?

371
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,951
She's out of her mind.

372
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,634
I see you still struggle with ties.

373
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,639
There was no need for you
to wear mourning clothes.

374
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,766
People will talk regardless.

375
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,729
Better this than being the bad
daughter-in-law who didn't attend.

376
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,732
I visited your father's hospital room.

377
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,818
I'm fairly certain
I'm the one who killed him.

378
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,322
What do you mean?

379
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,160
You know how I tend to horrify people.

380
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,080
This might be better for everyone,
including you.

381
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,166
And your father's
finally out of his misery.

382
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:57,960
These are non-addictive.

383
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,547
They're even prescribed
in American hospitals.

384
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,342
Take them if the current meds fail.

385
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,599
I'm bad with ties.

386
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,631
Ask one of the employees.
They'll do a splendid job of it.

387
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,354
They're pros, after all.

388
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,397
See you outside.

389
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:42,940
Where were you?

390
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,108
Close by.

391
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,864
Stay by my side.

392
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,782
According to the manual,

393
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,493
I'm not allowed to attend
official events like these.

394
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,204
What you wanted...

395
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,916
was a discreet marriage, remember?

396
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,212
You and that damn manual.

397
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,967
You're all set. You should go now.

398
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,057
I need you.

399
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:21,728
I know.

400
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:47,254
Maybe women lose their marbles
after having an ovary removed.

401
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,422
Watch your words.

402
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:52,301
What is she doing at a stranger's funeral?
What about her young husband?

403
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,805
He knew her since she was little,
like the daughter he never had.

404
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,058
Jeong-won's an only child and all.

405
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,477
An ex-daughter-in-law
is no better than a stranger.

406
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:04,897
Have you ever seen
a conglomerate CEO's ex-daughter-in-law

407
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,232
show up at his funeral?

408
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:09,944
"The daughter he never had"?
You know they were never close.

409
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,529
Where is Ms. Noh In-ji anyway?

410
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,406
- If I were her, I'd be seeing red.
- Please...

411
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,920
- She's here!
- What is it? What?

412
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,476
Are they seriously going ahead with this?

413
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:46,981
No way.

414
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,531
You don't need to do this.

415
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,617
No one would bad-mouth you
if you weren't here.

416
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,161
I'm doing this for you.

417
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,498
What do you mean,
you're doing this for me?

418
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:09,628
Someone passed away after being in a coma.
What's there to be curious about?

419
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,422
People will say it was about time.

420
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,340
The problem is you.

421
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:19,555
In their eyes,
you're a bum who doesn't have a real job.

422
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,599
What do you think people will say?

423
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:26,103
"He was alone, looking pathetic."
"Won't be long before he's back on drugs."

424
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,773
Your audience
is full of insufferable jerks.

425
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,525
Do you want to add fuel to the fire?

426
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,237
I'm the one you need right now,

427
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,406
not that woman.

428
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,536
Honey, people won't go easy on you.

429
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:47,666
The sudden downfall of a dead CEO's son
is the juiciest kind of gossip.

430
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,167
Think about it.

431
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:53,088
Consider which of us will be better suited
if you want a quiet life.

432
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:42,137
You're more fearless than I thought.
What if someone saw you here?

433
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,265
Leave Mr. Han Jeong-won alone.

434
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,104
He'll never be yours.

435
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,734
You should know your place.

436
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,278
I didn't pay for you to act like this.

437
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,657
This is exactly what you paid for,
for me to act as a wife would.

438
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:03,659
"A wife"?

439
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:05,869
A short-lived title.

440
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:13,085
For some, a year is enough time
to plan their own death.

441
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:17,089
For others, it's enough time
to steel their resolve to keep living.

442
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,174
In a year, a human can be born,

443
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:23,262
and you shattered that.

444
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:30,477
A child's delightful steps,
a whole universe that could have been.

445
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,943
You don't know anything!

446
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,404
What the hell
would a lowlife like you know?

447
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:48,662
Mr. Han Jeong-won saw you
jump into oncoming traffic.

448
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:54,293
I'm saying he saw you
throw your child out into the road.

449
00:45:57,254 --> 00:46:00,674
He even blames himself for it.
For you jumping into the road.

450
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,052
One thing's for sure.

451
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,929
This marriage will work,

452
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,432
and once I'm done,
Mr. Han will live a different life.

453
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,103
I want Mr. Han Jeong-won to be happy.

454
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:15,606
What do you want for him?

455
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:24,655
You should go now.

456
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,159
If you stay here any longer,

457
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:31,455
I might just end up telling
Mr. Han Jeong-won a lot more about you.

458
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,125
Aren't you curious

459
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,753
how much I know about you,
Ms. Lee Seo-yeon?

460
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:33,016
Only one son, but two daughters-in-law.

461
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:34,767
This is madness.

462
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,155
Ms. Lee Seo-yeon is gone now.

463
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,078
I'll stay by your side.

464
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,126
What about the manual?

465
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:01,586
I think I'll...

466
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:05,632
take the day off today.

467
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:23,210
MY SINCERE CONDOLENCES
LEE SEO-YEON

468
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:39,142
We should get you straight to a spa.
You look really ugly right now.

469
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,647
Have you ever been selected?

470
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,527
Let's say there's you and Cheol-su,

471
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,989
and if someone picks Cheol-su, you die.
That sort of thing.

472
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,117
My life is all about being picked,

473
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:59,037
but nothing ever reaching the level
of a Nazi concentration camp.

474
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,792
I've always been on the picking side.

475
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,254
If I didn't like a homeroom teacher,
I simply switched classes.

476
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,966
And I always found a way
to sit next to kids I liked.

477
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,093
I always got what I wanted,

478
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,471
be it friends or grown-ups.

479
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,975
Men were even easier to get,

480
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,686
so I never minded
people calling me an evil bitch.

481
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,230
Do you suddenly feel wronged

482
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,567
for being called an evil bitch?

483
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:30,569
Why does it suddenly feel

484
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:34,573
like the whole world
now revolves around Noh In-ji?

485
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:39,244
She was only supposed to play
a minor role for a year...

486
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,542
but now I feel like Cheol-su,
who wasn't picked.

487
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,265
LATE HAN YEONG-HO

488
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,812
You should get some sleep.

489
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,148
I don't think anyone else is coming.

490
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,986
That would be a waste...

491
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:17,948
of your day off.

492
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,750
Shall we go someplace fun?

493
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,156
You might not be able to see.

494
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,952
I really can't see properly.

495
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:04,746
So it's not just me, then?

496
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,539
I can see.

497
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:08,750
What are we even doing?

498
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,633
Why is it so quiet?

499
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,053
I purposely picked an unpopular film.

500
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,304
That's a relief.

501
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,349
You smell like incense.

502
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,811
You're right. I do.

503
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:36,986
Help yourself.

504
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,086
I think this will suit you well.

505
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:58,884
I'm not that short.

506
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:06,016
It's cute.
It looks like a piano key cover.

507
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,226
Is that...?

508
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:17,818
Turn around.

509
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,291
Why are you smiling?

510
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,419
I feel like I'm leaving a bathhouse.

511
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:38,840
When I was little,
I once went with my friends.

512
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:43,428
I only realized after we'd left
that I had soap on my ears.

513
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,557
Still, it was refreshing and felt great.

514
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,102
Though I had to take another bath at home.

515
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:59,819
I'm not sure I should be feeling this way
just after my father died.

516
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:06,368
Not all fathers in the world
deserve to be mourned.

517
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,954
That goes for all moms too.

518
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,790
Did your mom

519
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:16,378
really kill that person?

520
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,675
If social death is a kind of death,
then yes.

521
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:27,597
Team Manager Seo of Sambin Electronics'
International Business Team.

522
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,267
I'm sure you've heard of him.

523
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:33,186
The clip went viral, after all.

524
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,814
That was my mother's work.

525
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,736
After finding out that her daughter
was about to marry a bisexual man,

526
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,782
she outed him to the whole country
just ten days before the wedding.

527
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,370
I got so many calls
that my phone ran out of battery.

528
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:54,040
They all wanted to know
if I was the victim of a scam.

529
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,548
And so I missed his calls,

530
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,134
or so I choose to believe.

531
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,346
Disappearing for five years
without so much as a call

532
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,308
just doesn't make sense.

533
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:15,937
Are you waiting for him?

534
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,071
What if...

535
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:32,871
I don't want to let you go later?

536
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,293
I'm just saying,

537
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,838
it might be a possibility.

538
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,519
LATE HAN YEONG-HO

539
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,443
<i>I found out
where Lee Seo-yeon gets her drugs.</i>

540
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,821
Being here like this

541
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,490
is interesting.

542
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:20,246
I'm sure your father will be real proud
as he moves on to the afterlife.

543
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,252
What is it you want to say?

544
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,505
Get a divorce.

545
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,724
Divorce him, Ms. Noh In-ji.

546
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:11,376
