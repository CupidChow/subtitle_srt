THE TRUNK

00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,043
FIVE MONTHS AGO

3
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,657
What did he...

4
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,203
He said I made him happy.

5
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,884
He's passed.

6
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,138
Ten past three...

7
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,226
Time of death...

8
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,978
No need. I already declared it.

9
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,483
I'm very sorry for your loss.

10
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,902
Please get in touch with his guardian.

11
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,283
Pardon, madam,

12
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,661
but where might you be going?

13
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,582
As of ten minutes ago, I'm divorced.

14
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,768
PROCEED TO YOUR NEXT MARRIAGE?
YES OR NO

15
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,995
I hope your assignment went well, Ms. Noh.

00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,181
Deputy Manager Noh, how was your marriage?

19
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,394
Don't you need a vacation?

20
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,771
I'll proceed as usual.

21
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,648
As you wish.

22
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,993
He doesn't exactly match well with you.

23
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,748
It'll be a different type of marriage
from your previous ones.

NM MEMBER PROFILE
HAN JEONG-WON

25
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,804
I heard that prick Han Jeong-won
is making movie music for our company now.

26
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,348
So he's taking a hands-off approach
to management?

27
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,685
- More like his hands were taken off.
- He was blitzed out of his mind earlier.

28
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,187
He's probably off getting high again.

29
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,689
Right?

30
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,108
I fucking knew it. Wait.

31
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,278
Is that why he got divorced? Drugs?

32
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,030
Hell if I know, you prick.

33
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,990
Come on, tell me what's really going on.

34
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:24,907
I don't know.

35
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,701
You know something. Spill it.

36
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:27,784
Keep it down.

37
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,872
<i>The person you have called
is currently unavailable...</i>

WIFE

39
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,750
<i>Sleeping pills in the bathroom again?</i>

40
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,963
<i>Why are you stumbling around clubs
like some kind of zombie?</i>

41
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,674
<i>Word on the street
is you're a pill-popper.</i>

42
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,720
<i>Why don't you sleep at home
instead of fucking around in clubs?</i>

43
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,597
I can't sleep at home.

44
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,891
<i>In that huge house of yours?</i>

45
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,478
<i>Try hopping between rooms.
You'll fall asleep in one eventually.</i>

46
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,457
<i>That's what's wrong with you rich folk.
You don't take anything seriously.</i>

47
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,315
<i>Go see a doctor!</i>

48
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,484
I've been going to one for over 20 years.

49
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,487
In fact, I'm about to go to one
for more sleeping pills. Bye.

50
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,045
<i>The person you have called is currently...</i>

51
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,869
WIFE

52
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,583
Please get rid of the lights
in the living room. They're unbearable.

53
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,879
<i>They're not lights, it's an art piece.
A prized possession of your father's.</i>

54
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,131
That's why I hate it so much.

55
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,510
<i>We can't just hang
any random thing up there.</i>

56
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,888
<i>I'm looking for a decent substitute
in France, so just wait.</i>

57
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:16,972
<i>Don't touch it.</i>

58
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:34,943
Mr. Han Jeong-won?

59
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,656
It's been a while.

60
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,876
I find that people are more relaxed
when I stand here like this.

61
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,170
You can always refuse, you know.

62
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,254
Then again,

63
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,591
an emergency arrest warrant
would be a bigger headache for you.

64
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,427
Who was it this time?

65
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,637
You know Jay Yoong, right?

66
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,181
Was it Yoong? Wasn't it Young?

67
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,062
Last night at the club, Mr. Jay...

68
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,690
whatever, was arrested on the spot,

69
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,900
and you happened to be there.

70
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,989
Oh my! Thank you.

71
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,035
- Why is it always me?
- You check all the boxes.

72
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,789
You're loaded from selling your shares,
have plenty of free time,

73
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,291
and you have a history.

74
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,877
History? I was just a child.

75
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,339
I'd hardly call a 17-year-old a child.

76
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,718
People that age know right from wrong,
and can choose accordingly.

77
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,988
- Son of a bitch.
- What the...

78
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,782
Jeong-won!

79
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,617
- You bastard!
- What's going on?

80
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,951
- Stop it!
- Let go of me!

81
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,208
- You fucking son of a bitch!
- Mr. Han, sir!

82
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,169
- Mr. Han, please!
- You motherfucker!

83
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,798
I told you, it was that prick!

84
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,508
Why don't you buy me out?

85
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,469
Just run the label.
You own 90%, compared to my tiny 5%.

86
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,930
I like working for you. It's comfy.

87
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,281
I take back calling her a fucking bitch.

88
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,813
I still don't understand
why Lee Seo-yeon dumped you like that.

89
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:37,525
Seems to me you've stepped in shit.
A pile of shit called Lee Seo-yeon.

90
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,444
So just go over to her
and do whatever it takes to get her back.

91
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:44,365
Stop tormenting us commoners
and go live your happily ever after!

92
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,660
- I can't.
- What do you mean you can't?

93
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,829
Nothing's impossible
with a bank account like yours.

94
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,914
What would you know?

95
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,880
I'm so grateful you offered
to take care of the remodeling.

96
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,425
I kept telling my husband
we should sell that run-down building,

97
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,344
but he just can't swallow his pride.

98
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,223
I have to ask,
how's life with a younger husband?

99
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:16,272
He'll never find out you got remarried.
You know me, I'm great at keeping secrets.

100
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,734
HAN JEONG-WON

101
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,325
By the way, is Mr. Han all right?

102
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,037
I heard he got caught
doing drugs at a club...

103
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:36,584
I mean, there was a misunderstanding,
and he got into a huge fight at the label.

104
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,302
Okay, let's have dinner.

105
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,304
I'll be there by 7:00.

106
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,058
You guys are divorced, right?

107
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,203
I was wondering if you'd remarried
without even getting divorced.

108
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,025
I'm just kidding.

109
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,946
Ms. Yoon-a, do you think you can live
with an empty husk?

110
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,033
I'm also kidding.

111
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,245
Jeong-won's getting married.
That's why we're meeting today.

112
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,039
So don't get any wrong ideas.

113
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,539
He is?

114
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,418
To whom?

115
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,253
Honey!

116
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,114
Han Jeong-won's getting married.
He must be out of his mind!

117
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,550
Maybe seeing Lee Seo-yeon get remarried
made him lose it.

118
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,928
Have you heard anything? Who could it be?

119
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,806
Maybe he met someone at a club.
Is that bastard really on drugs?

120
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,022
Hello.

121
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,986
I take prescription drugs too, you know.

122
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,696
Right.

123
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,411
I'm going now.

124
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,495
Okay.

125
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,523
Your table is over there, ma'am.

126
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,492
It's been a while.

127
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,828
We met at the label just last week.

128
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,205
That's precisely my point.

129
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,458
We're supposed to see each other
every day.

130
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,627
The reason we can't

131
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,780
isn't because of our divorce,
it's because of my remarriage.

132
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,425
Soon you'll be remarried too.

133
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,016
May I take your order?

134
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,475
What's the chef's special?

135
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,228
It's a multi-course meal.

136
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,564
Mini caprese
made with <i>yukhoe</i> and truffle oil,

137
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,775
followed by tomato risotto arancini,
stuffed with cream cheese.

138
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,152
Last, a tenderloin steak,

139
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:11,697
which comes with a side of prosciutto
and a minced shrimp pesto sauce.

140
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,616
I'd like a cod steak
without tomatoes, please.

141
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,785
One of us here detests tomatoes.

142
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,413
Right, I'll pass that on to the kitchen.

143
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,342
I've had them on me since last week.

144
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,802
I know you like that style.

145
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,059
They're pretty.

146
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,728
Try them on.

147
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,148
Later.

148
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,070
I'm sure you'll enjoy your marriage too.

149
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,238
Why are you doing this to me?

150
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,448
It's only for a year.

151
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,326
Think of it as an arranged marriage.

152
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
Seo-yeon.

153
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,663
I can't live without you.

154
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,502
We went to kindergarten together.
I gave up studying abroad to be with you.

155
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,962
You know I can't function without you.

156
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,715
- It would break me.
- You've never tried living without me.

157
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,385
A contract marriage...

158
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,932
A temporary marriage, seriously?

159
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,975
You already signed the papers.

160
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,144
You said you'd never see me again
if I didn't.

161
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,689
I know you're trying to punish me,

162
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,525
but you've gone too far.

163
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,110
Me?

164
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,946
I'm punishing <i>you?</i>

165
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm the one being punished.

166
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,045
Being alive in front of you
is punishment enough.

167
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,673
If you don't go through
with this marriage,

168
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,174
we're over.

169
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,273
We're done here. I'm heading out.

170
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,525
Let's eat together at home.

171
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,405
My husband's here.

172
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,198
I'm leaving now.

173
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,280
Damn it.

174
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,094
<i>The person you have called is currently...</i>

175
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:28,328
HAN JEONG-WON

176
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,325
<i>The person you have called
is currently unavailable. Please leave...</i>

177
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,497
You really don't have
a resident registration card on you?

178
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,082
Seriously?

179
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,165
What's this guy in for?

180
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,128
Trying to steal a car.

181
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,340
Caught him red-handed on my way in.

182
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,053
- And the car owner?
- We've been calling but no answer.

183
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:16,395
Look, mister.
Stonewalling me won't solve anything.

184
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,813
Fancy a night behind bars?

185
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:36,956
Who are...

186
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,334
I'm Mr. Han Jeong-won's wife.

187
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,462
I see.

188
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,841
So his name's Han Jeong-won, is it?

189
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,764
I've reached the owner of the car.

190
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,726
She says she knew all about it.
She lost her keys and told him to do it.

191
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,271
She knew he was smashing her car window?

192
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,605
May I take him now?

193
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,232
Well...

194
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,068
Let's go, honey.

195
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,063
The owner saw the boat was gone
and hauled it back like that this morning.

196
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:46,568
Also, a fisherman says he heard a sound
like a gunshot at around one o'clock.

197
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,196
He heard a gunshot but didn't report it?

198
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,490
He thought it was a firecracker.

199
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:54,534
- Any bullet shells?
- We've yet to find them.

200
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,118
No security cameras?

201
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:59,247
The one at the kayak house
is the only one in the area,

202
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,166
but someone cut the wires.

203
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,294
So there's no body, just a trunk?

204
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:09,883
By the way, sir, do you know
how much a trunk like this costs?

205
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:15,138
50,230,000 won. That's 50 million!

206
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,227
It's a limited-edition piece, apparently.

207
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,103
There are only three
in the entire country.

208
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,566
Call the store,
tell them the serial number,

209
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,026
and find out who bought it.

210
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,529
They keep records of the buyers
for items like these.

211
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,156
How do you even know that?

212
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,995
My wallet's Prada.
You got a problem with that?

213
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,326
It's a knockoff, right, man?

214
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,751
Sir. A knockoff, <i>sir.</i>

215
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,086
All right. Take it.

216
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,354
Would you like me to thank you?

217
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,107
Or should I commend you
for doing your job?

218
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,484
That won't be necessary.

219
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,905
I didn't bring my car
because I was arrested on the spot.

220
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,448
I'll be taking a taxi home.

221
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,368
You can find your own way back.

222
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,739
Get in.

223
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,495
Is this my car?

224
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,079
Yes, so get in.

225
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,735
I think you owe me an explanation.

226
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,863
It was Mr. Kim.

227
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,991
You told him you didn't want a lawyer.

228
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,831
I have a question.

229
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,667
Yes?

230
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,297
You get married for a living.

231
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,346
Do you enjoy this line of work?

232
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,648
It depends.

233
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,546
<i>That one, please.</i>

234
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:39,843
What great taste.
I'm sure your bride-to-be will love it.

235
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,388
It's my second marriage.
I guess my eye for quality's improved.

236
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,475
- I'll take them.
- Sure.

237
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,981
I see your former wife
recommended us to you.

238
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,367
Isn't that how it is
for all of your clients?

239
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,363
I'm curious,

240
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,241
why does W&L run this kind of business?

241
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:08,830
Is your wedding business so slow
that you're now matchmaking on the side?

242
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:17,172
How long do you think
your current marriage will last?

243
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,050
In the future,
as human lifespan increases,

244
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,219
we may end up
having to live with one partner

245
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,303
for 100 years.

246
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,721
100 years.

247
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,057
Could you handle that?

248
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,438
We're in the pursuit
of creating happy marriages.

249
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,065
Trying to stay ahead of the curve,
if you will.

250
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:42,030
Consider yourself lucky,
Mr. Han Jeong-won.

251
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,356
It's pine nut porridge.

252
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,399
I figured you must have skipped dinner.

253
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,531
I've unpacked in the empty room
on the second floor.

254
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,200
Let me know if you'd like me to move
to a different room.

255
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,743
Do I refer to you as my wife?

256
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,746
Is that how this works?

257
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:33,914
That's right.

258
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,669
Funny to call you my wife

259
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,231
when everything else is so unofficial.

260
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,841
We offer other types of marriages too.

261
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,385
You specifically chose a discreet one.

262
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:53,810
It appears I'll need to keep up
this arrangement for the time being.

263
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,146
I'm not sure what I can and can't do.

264
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,648
Then why not check the manual?

265
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,735
Get some sleep.

266
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:40,892
I get it, okay?

267
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,272
Please stop, Mom.

268
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,320
Mom.

269
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,950
Mom.

270
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,163
<i>Mom.</i>

271
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,828
You're up earlier than I thought.

272
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,164
You don't need to accommodate me.

273
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,333
I usually don't eat at home.

274
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,086
Who said anything about me
catering to your tastes?

275
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,049
Take a seat.

276
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,553
Humor me. It's our first day as newlyweds.

277
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:18,533
I've been told you like fish.
Apparently, halibut is rich in collagen.

278
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,618
There's something I like

279
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,121
even more than fish.

280
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,045
But I have a weak stomach,

281
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,463
so I'll save it for later.

282
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,550
The smell's a turnoff today.

283
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,475
Let's hear that again.

284
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,444
You're gonna leave that there?

285
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,697
Is that mine?

286
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,199
Well, it's not mine. Bring it in.

287
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,834
I bet it's just another thing
your friend Si-jeong got

288
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,295
instead of actually being paid.

289
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,554
It's not bad.

290
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:32,059
- Please don't let them die.
- That's not up to me, is it?

291
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,563
You never know
what life's gonna throw at you.

292
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,524
For all we know,
I might die before these guys.

293
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,444
I won't let them starve, though.

294
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,487
And I'll change the water often.

295
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,412
Has the bastard who owns this place
ever been in touch?

296
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,040
All he left behind
is this empty shell of a house.

297
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:58,085
Please look after the fish
and don't touch anything else.

298
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:00,963
Did you kill him?

299
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,553
It'd be fine with me if you did.

300
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,805
That would make more sense

301
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:14,226
than a groom-to-be disappearing for years,
never to be heard from again.

302
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,227
You're right.

303
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,645
I killed him.

304
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,191
You crazy bitch. Just get over him.

305
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,903
Get married, have kids,
and start living like any other bitch.

306
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,657
Keep the coffee machine stocked.

307
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:03,692
SI-JEONG

308
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,403
Yeah?

309
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,906
<i>Hey, In-ji. That bastard got out.</i>

310
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,493
- Who?
<i>- Who do you think? Eom Tae-seong.</i>

311
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,454
<i>I ran into him
while I was out on a delivery.</i>

312
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,622
<i>How'd the bastard get out?</i>

313
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:20,167
Wasn't he supposed to rot
in a mental hospital forever?

314
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,336
Where is he now?

315
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,389
God fucking damn it.

316
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,934
Don't do anything for now.
I'll try to find out what happened.

317
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,078
<i>The doors are opening.</i>

318
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,427
I saw the earrings on the back seat.

319
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,262
I know. The police told me.

320
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,642
Thanks for sorting things out
with the police.

321
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:03,145
Should I... buy you a new car?

322
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,547
I hadn't thrown them away.
I forgot the case after putting them on.

323
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,289
I told you they were pretty, didn't I?

324
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,002
Man, this is so embarrassing.

325
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,219
How was your first night?

326
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,933
All right, I guess.

327
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,560
That's a relief.

328
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,146
Yeah.

329
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,448
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

330
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,968
It'll be over soon.
You're okay when you're with me, remember?

331
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,807
I left my car keys in the office.

332
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:42,493
I guess this...

333
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,416
is like separation anxiety dogs must feel.

334
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,628
I'll be better.

335
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,005
Come back. We'll start over.

336
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:56,342
This whole arrangement is ridiculous,
you know.

337
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,760
Honey.

338
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:00,762
I wish...

339
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,309
you would die.

340
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,022
<i>The doors are opening.</i>

341
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,070
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

342
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:58,986
Hello?

343
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:01,782
<i>Come on out. Don't just stay in there.</i>

344
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,337
Are you a good cook?

345
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,214
Sometimes.

346
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,476
Don't overthink it.

347
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,520
"Happily ever after,
'til death do us part."

348
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:33,355
That only applies to us for a year.

349
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:43,949
This isn't bad.

350
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:45,993
The fish did all the work.

351
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,871
They were expensive. I used your card.

352
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:01,842
Is this whole thing

353
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,637
like an expensive
live-in housemaid service?

354
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:10,684
Is sex included?

355
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:17,775
Or would you be fine with a husband
who cheats on you every day?

356
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,235
I love women, you know.

357
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:23,989
Is that what you want?

358
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,264
Is it not allowed?

359
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,435
We're married, aren't we?

360
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:44,819
It's allowed.

361
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,450
If we both want it.

362
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,130
It'll be a while then, I guess.

363
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,343
I'm rather shy, you see.

364
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,105
Thanks for the meal, or...

365
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,318
maybe a thanks is unnecessary.

366
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,403
I haven't read the manual yet.

367
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,185
What do you think you're...

368
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,481
I'm sorry if I woke you up.
I just really have to watch this match.

369
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:28,734
Do you like soccer?

370
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,277
No.

371
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,361
Baseball?

372
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,031
I detest chasing after balls.

373
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:36,950
I knew you wouldn't be a fan
of team sports.

374
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,415
Buy a TV for your room.
Buy as many as you want.

375
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,793
Does it bother you that much?

376
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,504
I guess your so-called system
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

377
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:53,383
I'm an insomniac on too many pills.
How did you miss this?

378
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,052
I saw your file.

379
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,805
I know you can't sleep
or do much of anything without drugs.

380
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,183
You're not sleeping anytime soon,
so join me.

381
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:02,476
Hey!

382
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,187
Maybe you'll fall asleep
if you watch something boring.

383
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,147
Ms. Noh In-ji.

384
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,230
Honey.

385
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,026
Want a beer?

386
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:13,987
There's some downstairs.

387
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,489
Wait right here.

388
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:05,413
It seems what you lack in mental fortitude
you make up for in agility.

389
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,916
I'm fine with you living somewhere else.

390
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:12,963
If you need a place, just say so.
I won't tell your company.

391
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:14,839
All I want

392
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,468
is for the next year
to pass by quietly, so...

393
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:19,552
Mr. Han Jeong-won.

394
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,811
Do you like playing hard to get?

395
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,815
I'm not trying to seduce you.

396
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:36,194
So you can relax around me.

397
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:42,325
It's okay to just be yourself,

398
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,120
at least when you're with me.

399
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:09,264
How do you know the owner of the trunk?

400
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:13,642
I'm her husband.

401
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:31,489
