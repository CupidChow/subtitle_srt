Gentlemen,

24
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:46,227
fate brought us together

25
00:01:46,427 --> 00:01:47,268
at the academy.

26
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:48,947
Why don't you talk things through?

27
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:49,628
Cheng Lisu,

28
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:51,067
you may not know.

29
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,468
There is no misunderstanding

30
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:56,427
between us.

31
00:01:59,227 --> 00:01:59,787
Right.

32
00:02:00,427 --> 00:02:01,268
No misunderstandings.

33
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:02,828
In the end,

34
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:04,507
I'm nothing

35
00:02:04,628 --> 00:02:06,108
but an oath-breaker.

36
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:23,627
Look!

37
00:02:31,004 --> 00:02:33,768
(Hua Youxian)

38
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:52,467
Hua Youxian?

39
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:54,388
She was

40
00:02:54,388 --> 00:02:55,467
the top of the Ruyun House,

41
00:02:55,747 --> 00:02:56,707
unmatched in Yaojing.

42
00:02:57,467 --> 00:02:59,068
How could she end up in Chonghuai?

43
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:19,388
Bravo!

44
00:03:19,668 --> 00:03:20,228
Great!

45
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:22,948
You are

46
00:03:22,948 --> 00:03:23,867
gracefully charming.

47
00:03:24,467 --> 00:03:25,627
You truly deserve

48
00:03:25,627 --> 00:03:26,988
the Ruyun House's reputation.

49
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:29,268
Your heavenly voice

50
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:30,548
lives up to its fame.

51
00:03:31,187 --> 00:03:31,948
Our money

52
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:33,388
was well spent indeed.

53
00:04:12,427 --> 00:04:13,307
Years have passed.

54
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,388
How have you been?

55
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:15,624
All is well.

56
00:04:15,948 --> 00:04:16,468
Miss Hua,

57
00:04:16,627 --> 00:04:17,192
and you?

58
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:18,148
I'm well, too.

59
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:19,668
Speaking of which,

60
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:21,148
I share a special connection

61
00:04:21,187 --> 00:04:22,028
with you all.

62
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:23,148
Back then,

63
00:04:23,627 --> 00:04:24,668
I received

64
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:26,427
a love letter from one of you.

65
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,228
Certain people
always chase after beauties.

66
00:04:30,747 --> 00:04:31,827
It must be his work.

67
00:04:32,427 --> 00:04:33,468
Back then, I ranked

68
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,187
second to last at Xianchang Academy.

69
00:04:35,507 --> 00:04:36,108
I couldn't even

70
00:04:36,228 --> 00:04:37,228
write proper essays,

71
00:04:37,588 --> 00:04:38,867
let alone love letters.

72
00:04:39,507 --> 00:04:41,348
To prove your innocence to Miss Song,

73
00:04:41,588 --> 00:04:42,588
you're exposing this.

74
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:45,028
Huaijin excels in

75
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:46,468
arts and martial skills.

76
00:04:47,148 --> 00:04:48,108
He always ranked first

77
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:49,307
at the academy.

78
00:04:49,627 --> 00:04:50,507
I bet this letter

79
00:04:50,668 --> 00:04:51,507
was his doing.

80
00:04:52,947 --> 00:04:54,267
See? He's not denying it.

81
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:54,908
It's a yes.

82
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:56,148
A penalty drink.

83
00:04:56,548 --> 00:04:57,187
Definitely him.

84
00:04:57,747 --> 00:04:59,588
Who knew you would

85
00:04:59,588 --> 00:05:01,028
have such a romantic side?

86
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:07,148
General Fengyun, since you are here,

87
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:09,187
as the local magistrate,

88
00:05:09,627 --> 00:05:10,588
I should host you.

89
00:05:11,627 --> 00:05:12,908
Tomorrow, I'll prepare a banquet

90
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:14,867
and hope you'll come.

91
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:20,387
It's rare for me to come.

92
00:05:21,148 --> 00:05:22,108
Miss Hua, would you like

93
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:23,548
to drink with me?

94
00:05:31,988 --> 00:05:33,028
Of course,

95
00:05:33,387 --> 00:05:34,627
I would like to.

96
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:47,588
Mr. Yang,

97
00:05:48,267 --> 00:05:49,668
why the long face?

98
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:17,788
Speaking of which,

99
00:06:18,108 --> 00:06:18,988
Miss Hua,

100
00:06:19,307 --> 00:06:20,588
what brought you to Chonghuai?

101
00:06:23,788 --> 00:06:24,988
I met a gentleman.

102
00:06:26,307 --> 00:06:26,947
Believing him

103
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:28,307
to be

104
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:29,548
my lifelong partner.

105
00:06:30,187 --> 00:06:31,228
I bought my freedom

106
00:06:32,228 --> 00:06:33,348
and married him.

107
00:06:34,148 --> 00:06:34,908
So

108
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:36,708
you are married?

109
00:06:38,228 --> 00:06:38,827
Yes.

110
00:06:40,588 --> 00:06:41,348
But

111
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:43,627
my judgment failed me.

112
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:44,867
Eventually,

113
00:06:45,387 --> 00:06:46,148
we divorced.

114
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,947
Why the separation?

115
00:06:53,427 --> 00:06:54,747
I entrusted myself

116
00:06:54,988 --> 00:06:55,747
to the wrong man.

117
00:06:57,028 --> 00:06:57,908
You were

118
00:06:57,988 --> 00:06:59,228
once renowned across the land.

119
00:06:59,827 --> 00:07:01,307
I heard of your legendary fame, too.

120
00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:04,228
Choosing marriage at your career's peak

121
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:05,827
meant you held

122
00:07:05,827 --> 00:07:06,827
deep affection for him.

123
00:07:11,387 --> 00:07:13,627
When I left the Ruyun House, the madam

124
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:14,788
asked me,

125
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:17,788
"Have you ever seen a moth fly

126
00:07:17,908 --> 00:07:19,028
into a flame and end well?"

127
00:07:19,988 --> 00:07:21,588
I was young then

128
00:07:22,387 --> 00:07:23,148
and firmly believed

129
00:07:23,468 --> 00:07:24,668
that even a fleeting moment

130
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,668
of warmth would be worth chasing.

131
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:29,028
I naturally fell for him

132
00:07:29,468 --> 00:07:30,307
and left with him

133
00:07:30,427 --> 00:07:31,187
without hesitation.

134
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:34,028
Later,

135
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,267
our affection dissipated,

136
00:07:38,228 --> 00:07:39,348
so I left him.

137
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:41,067
Isn't that human nature?

138
00:07:48,028 --> 00:07:48,627
Now,

139
00:07:48,988 --> 00:07:50,067
I live freely

140
00:07:50,108 --> 00:07:50,827
in this city,

141
00:07:51,108 --> 00:07:52,827
self-sufficient and unbound.

142
00:07:53,028 --> 00:07:54,028
So joyful.

143
00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:56,507
I've never regretted

144
00:07:56,668 --> 00:07:57,947
any decision I've made,

145
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:00,427
be it past or present.

146
00:08:02,468 --> 00:08:03,827
Your clarity of purpose

147
00:08:04,427 --> 00:08:05,507
is admirable.

148
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:08,228
Let me toast to you.

149
00:08:13,387 --> 00:08:13,947
Thank you,

150
00:08:14,588 --> 00:08:15,267
Miss.

151
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:19,827
You have sharp eyes.

152
00:08:27,947 --> 00:08:30,228
Your dance is captivating

153
00:08:30,788 --> 00:08:31,627
and famous.

154
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,387
Now, you're single.

155
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:34,948
Our garrison has

156
00:08:34,988 --> 00:08:36,108
many outstanding young men.

157
00:08:36,747 --> 00:08:37,308
Perhaps

158
00:08:37,787 --> 00:08:39,228
some might suit your standards?

159
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,787
Your brave warriors

160
00:08:44,068 --> 00:08:46,108
are certainly worthy of me.

161
00:08:49,507 --> 00:08:50,108
Xiao Jue.

162
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:51,907
What do you mean?

163
00:08:52,108 --> 00:08:53,588
(He's egging him on.)

164
00:08:53,787 --> 00:08:55,348
Both are unwed.

165
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:56,747
Why not play

166
00:08:57,468 --> 00:08:58,348
the matchmaker?

167
00:09:03,988 --> 00:09:04,747
It's my marriage.

168
00:09:05,308 --> 00:09:06,228
None of your concern.

169
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:07,787
I...

170
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:09,308
I...

171
00:09:14,068 --> 00:09:15,708
Miss Hua is beautiful and skilled in

172
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:16,547
song and dance.

173
00:09:17,027 --> 00:09:17,667
She deserves

174
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,188
a promising young partner.

175
00:09:19,627 --> 00:09:20,667
Why do you object?

176
00:09:21,188 --> 00:09:21,907
Exactly. Huaijin.

177
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:23,147
Go introduce her

178
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:23,867
to some brave ones

179
00:09:23,988 --> 00:09:24,828
of your men.

180
00:09:26,627 --> 00:09:27,428
Naturally.

181
00:09:29,147 --> 00:09:30,027
Xiao Jue.

182
00:09:36,547 --> 00:09:37,108
Youxian.

183
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:39,428
The love letter

184
00:09:39,988 --> 00:09:41,027
was from you, right?

185
00:09:43,348 --> 00:09:44,068
Her ex-husband

186
00:09:44,787 --> 00:09:45,468
is also you.

187
00:09:45,907 --> 00:09:47,308
So it was you all along.

188
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:51,267
Back then,

189
00:09:51,988 --> 00:09:53,027
we were both young.

190
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:05,188
I want to buy your freedom.

191
00:10:06,547 --> 00:10:07,108
I wonder

192
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:08,747
if you would like

193
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:11,188
to become my wife?

194
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,867
Our backgrounds are worlds apart.

195
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:26,228
Marriage isn't a game.

196
00:10:26,988 --> 00:10:28,747
There's too much at stake.

197
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:31,188
Let me think again.

198
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:32,787
Stop right there!

199
00:10:34,787 --> 00:10:37,308
Dreaming of marrying a courtesan?

200
00:10:37,988 --> 00:10:39,147
You'll disgrace our family!

201
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:42,188
Defending a traitor against your father?

202
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:43,468
Leave now,

203
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,387
and you're no longer a Yang!

204
00:10:45,907 --> 00:10:47,308
Don't come back ever!

205
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:04,068
Why torture yourself?

206
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:11,387
Come away with me.

207
00:11:15,627 --> 00:11:16,188
Alright.

208
00:11:16,988 --> 00:11:17,988
I'll go with you.

209
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:24,840
(Yang Mansion)

210
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:29,308
I'm worthless.

211
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:33,787
Tell me.

212
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,068
What's truly burdening you?

213
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:39,828
Tell me!

214
00:11:48,907 --> 00:11:49,627
Give back my wine.

215
00:11:59,027 --> 00:11:59,667
Enough.

216
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:02,708
Let's divorce.

217
00:12:06,068 --> 00:12:06,907
May we

218
00:12:07,547 --> 00:12:08,708
never meet again.

219
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:19,507
I'm unworthy.

220
00:12:20,547 --> 00:12:21,188
Mingzhi,

221
00:12:21,747 --> 00:12:23,188
how could you be so blind?

222
00:12:24,547 --> 00:12:25,787
You never compromised your will

223
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:27,468
or dignity.

224
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,988
So free-spirited and open-hearted.

225
00:12:30,428 --> 00:12:31,667
Truly admirable.

226
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:34,228
You should be our role model as women.

227
00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:36,507
I'm flattered.

228
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:38,068
Life is too short

229
00:12:38,428 --> 00:12:39,747
to waste on self-compromise.

230
00:12:46,147 --> 00:12:46,708
Youxian.

231
00:12:49,027 --> 00:12:49,667
You...

232
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,108
failed the Commander

233
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:53,907
and then Miss Hua.

234
00:12:55,068 --> 00:12:56,348
A blind and foolish man.

235
00:12:58,627 --> 00:12:59,308
I was thinking

236
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:03,348
back then, the Commander

237
00:13:04,108 --> 00:13:05,588
lost both parents,

238
00:13:06,108 --> 00:13:07,387
his comrades fell in battle,

239
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:09,308
and his friend betrayed him.

240
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:11,147
Knowing something was wrong

241
00:13:11,588 --> 00:13:12,708
but finding no proof.

242
00:13:13,787 --> 00:13:15,348
That feeling of helplessness

243
00:13:16,627 --> 00:13:17,667
must have been unbearable.

244
00:13:22,147 --> 00:13:23,188
As for Miss Hua,

245
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:24,988
who became your wife,

246
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,948
she deserved your respect,

247
00:13:31,108 --> 00:13:32,507
but you neglected her.

248
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:34,387
Did you think

249
00:13:34,907 --> 00:13:35,627
avoiding violence

250
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:36,787
meant keeping

251
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:37,948
your gentleman's code?

252
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:39,747
Don't you know

253
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:42,308
complete indifference and neglect

254
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:43,867
hurt more than blows?

255
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:45,828
It means

256
00:13:46,507 --> 00:13:47,428
from your heart

257
00:13:48,387 --> 00:13:49,428
to your eyes,

258
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,308
she ceased to exist.

259
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,787
My father's wrongful conviction

260
00:14:06,507 --> 00:14:07,588
has nothing to do with you.

261
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,108
I never expected

262
00:14:10,787 --> 00:14:11,507
your single word

263
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:13,228
to change everything.

264
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:15,308
I did resent you

265
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:17,867
for your disrespectful remarks,

266
00:14:19,228 --> 00:14:20,228
but that's in the past.

267
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:22,267
We're but specks

268
00:14:22,267 --> 00:14:23,828
in the vast river of time,

269
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:25,387
gone in an instant.

270
00:14:27,108 --> 00:14:28,108
I won't lecture you,

271
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,228
nor should you trap yourself.

272
00:14:34,787 --> 00:14:35,988
When you're at rock bottom,

273
00:14:36,948 --> 00:14:38,308
every step taken

274
00:14:39,988 --> 00:14:40,988
is upward progress.

275
00:14:42,108 --> 00:14:43,787
Escapism and despair achieve nothing.

276
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:46,108
I'll find the truth to clear

277
00:14:47,027 --> 00:14:47,867
my father's name

278
00:14:49,027 --> 00:14:50,027
and restore honor

279
00:14:51,747 --> 00:14:53,068
to the Xiao Army.

280
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:55,948
That day will come.

281
00:15:00,787 --> 00:15:01,867
As for Miss Hua,

282
00:15:03,108 --> 00:15:04,228
rather than feeling guilty,

283
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:05,907
take action instead.

284
00:15:07,147 --> 00:15:08,068
Self-pity

285
00:15:09,228 --> 00:15:10,068
is utterly useless.

286
00:15:17,267 --> 00:15:18,147
Stop drinking.

287
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:18,948
You'll be drunk.

288
00:15:20,747 --> 00:15:22,547
Do you have troubles, Miss?

289
00:15:29,468 --> 00:15:31,828
I made a righteous lecture earlier,

290
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,988
but I'm just a deserter myself.

291
00:15:36,988 --> 00:15:38,188
What right do I have

292
00:15:38,468 --> 00:15:40,027
to criticize Yang Mingzhi?

293
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:43,828
How ridiculous.

294
00:15:46,828 --> 00:15:47,747
You must have

295
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:50,308
your own struggles, too.

296
00:15:58,547 --> 00:15:59,948
My minor troubles

297
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:02,867
pale compared to his suffering.

298
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:05,547
They're insignificant.

299
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,428
But I see your pain.

300
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:31,588
Youxian.

301
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:44,108
I was wrong.

302
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:47,068
I won't ask your forgiveness.

303
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:48,667
I just wish

304
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:51,428
to return to your side.

305
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,907
If possible,

306
00:16:55,588 --> 00:16:56,387
I want to make up

307
00:16:56,387 --> 00:16:57,348
for the hurt I caused.

308
00:16:59,267 --> 00:16:59,948
It is

309
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:02,747
none of my concern.

310
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:05,468
Youxian.

311
00:17:12,347 --> 00:17:12,948
Youxian.

312
00:17:13,507 --> 00:17:14,388
That's my only wish.

313
00:17:15,307 --> 00:17:16,228
You can ignore me,

314
00:17:16,908 --> 00:17:17,547
reject me,

315
00:17:18,628 --> 00:17:19,948
but I want to stay with you

316
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:24,908
because I truly love you.

317
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:56,787
Actually...

318
00:17:59,507 --> 00:18:01,107
Actually, I...

319
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:07,188
How much did you drink tonight?

320
00:18:09,908 --> 00:18:11,228
Will you hate me?

321
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:20,872
Commander.

322
00:18:23,827 --> 00:18:24,347
Commander.

323
00:18:27,827 --> 00:18:28,747
He Yan let me

324
00:18:28,787 --> 00:18:30,107
deliver this letter to you.

325
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:36,988
(By the riverside pavilion,
awaiting our conversation.)

326
00:18:37,428 --> 00:18:38,188
(I'll be waiting.)

327
00:18:38,507 --> 00:18:39,988
You see each other every day.

328
00:18:40,107 --> 00:18:41,468
Why write letters instead of

329
00:18:41,868 --> 00:18:42,587
speaking directly?

330
00:18:49,988 --> 00:18:50,708
Mr. Xiao.

331
00:18:53,988 --> 00:18:54,628
Miss Hua.

332
00:18:56,827 --> 00:18:57,547
I came here

333
00:18:57,547 --> 00:18:58,827
to thank you.

334
00:18:59,228 --> 00:18:59,868
Why?

335
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:01,267
You went to great trouble

336
00:19:01,267 --> 00:19:02,148
to help

337
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,148
Yang Mingzhi and me.

338
00:19:03,988 --> 00:19:05,587
I'm deeply grateful.

339
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,307
I wanted to beat him up,

340
00:19:09,908 --> 00:19:11,868
but the opportunity slipped away.

341
00:19:14,228 --> 00:19:16,107
So you're blaming me, Mr. Xiao?

342
00:19:17,827 --> 00:19:18,868
His choice to be with me

343
00:19:18,948 --> 00:19:19,628
is his freedom.

344
00:19:20,228 --> 00:19:21,307
And how I choose to respond

345
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:22,428
is mine.

346
00:19:22,948 --> 00:19:23,547
Good then.

347
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:24,988
I'm sorry.

348
00:19:25,587 --> 00:19:26,267
I have to go.

349
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:28,584
By the way,

350
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,188
someone came with you to Ruyun House

351
00:19:31,468 --> 00:19:32,587
back then too.

352
00:19:33,347 --> 00:19:34,468
I remember very clearly.

353
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,188
Delicate yet determined,

354
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:37,307
wearing a mask,

355
00:19:37,747 --> 00:19:39,027
refusing to reveal the identity.

356
00:19:39,988 --> 00:19:41,067
Where is the person now?

357
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:43,868
All things pass away.

358
00:19:45,107 --> 00:19:46,067
Not worth mentioning.

359
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:50,468
So,

360
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,747
you two have grown distant?

361
00:19:54,388 --> 00:19:54,948
Right.

362
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:57,027
You've been battling everywhere.

363
00:19:57,507 --> 00:19:58,307
It must've been hard

364
00:19:58,347 --> 00:19:59,347
for you to stay in touch.

365
00:20:00,307 --> 00:20:01,908
After all, she's a lady.

366
00:20:06,428 --> 00:20:07,148
What?

367
00:20:10,948 --> 00:20:12,388
Don't you know, Mr. Xiao?

368
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,468
She wore a chest binder

369
00:20:15,228 --> 00:20:16,267
and acted so nervous.

370
00:20:16,668 --> 00:20:17,908
When I casually teased her,

371
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:19,188
she became flustered.

372
00:20:19,547 --> 00:20:21,787
That shy, nervous demeanor
could only belong

373
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,027
to a young lady.

374
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,668
My eyes never deceive me.

375
00:20:26,972 --> 00:20:31,267
(Yunlai Inn)

376
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:32,267
Strangely enough,

377
00:20:32,908 --> 00:20:33,948
He Rufei's sister

378
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:36,027
is also called

379
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:36,868
He Yan.

380
00:20:40,347 --> 00:20:41,428
A woman like you

381
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,468
joined Yezhou Garrison as a new recruit.

382
00:20:45,267 --> 00:20:46,668
There must be a hidden story.

383
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:48,428
The day will come

384
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,107
when your secrets are uncovered.

385
00:20:51,988 --> 00:20:53,347
What secrets could I have?

386
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:55,107
We were simply

387
00:20:56,027 --> 00:20:57,228
meant to meet each other.

388
00:21:00,188 --> 00:21:01,628
Beware of He Rufei.

389
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:03,988
He made me hold back

390
00:21:04,027 --> 00:21:05,587
General Xiao's plea for help

391
00:21:06,468 --> 00:21:07,868
for a few days.

392
00:21:08,507 --> 00:21:09,468
Beware of whom?

393
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:13,668
(Who are you really?)

394
00:21:14,628 --> 00:21:16,267
(Miss He Yan from the He family?)

395
00:21:16,747 --> 00:21:17,668
(Or He Rufei, the one)

396
00:21:17,668 --> 00:21:19,307
(from back then who was afraid)

397
00:21:20,507 --> 00:21:21,507
(to show his true face?)

398
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:24,468
(If you're He Rufei,)

399
00:21:25,228 --> 00:21:26,747
(then who is the current He Rufei?)

400
00:21:27,388 --> 00:21:29,027
(If you're the He Rufei of old,)

401
00:21:29,148 --> 00:21:29,868
(why would you)

402
00:21:30,347 --> 00:21:31,787
(abandon us in our direst hour?)

403
00:22:44,347 --> 00:22:44,904
Commander.

404
00:22:52,188 --> 00:22:53,787
You do know the Xiao's sword techniques.

405
00:22:54,388 --> 00:22:55,107
You've found out.

406
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:56,787
The Qinglang Sword Style

407
00:22:57,388 --> 00:22:58,388
is known by the Xiaos

408
00:22:59,307 --> 00:23:00,668
and one other person only.

409
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:04,628
Exactly.

410
00:23:07,027 --> 00:23:08,347
I was once He Rufei.

411
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:10,787
That's not my true name.

412
00:23:11,827 --> 00:23:12,787
I am He Yan,

413
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:14,587
the stepsister

414
00:23:14,628 --> 00:23:15,668
of the current He Rufei.

415
00:23:16,827 --> 00:23:17,787
From childhood,

416
00:23:18,668 --> 00:23:20,067
our identities were swapped.

417
00:23:20,948 --> 00:23:21,948
You exchanged identities?

418
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:23,587
I've been He Rufei

419
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,267
for as long as I can remember.

420
00:23:25,868 --> 00:23:26,468
They claimed

421
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:28,267
my brother wouldn't live long.

422
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,307
I had to impersonate He Rufei,

423
00:23:31,188 --> 00:23:32,307
or the family's noble title

424
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:33,747
would be revoked.

425
00:23:35,468 --> 00:23:36,267
So I had no choice

426
00:23:36,347 --> 00:23:37,708
but to live as He Rufei.

427
00:23:39,148 --> 00:23:40,228
But I refused to submit to

428
00:23:40,267 --> 00:23:40,988
such a fate.

429
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:42,587
So I left home and joined

430
00:23:43,107 --> 00:23:44,067
the Fuyue Army.

431
00:23:44,948 --> 00:23:45,787
I earned merits

432
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:47,307
and received honors,

433
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,067
but my brother who should've died young

434
00:23:51,468 --> 00:23:52,628
was still alive.

435
00:23:53,827 --> 00:23:54,868
When he returned home,

436
00:23:56,547 --> 00:23:57,787
he poisoned and blinded me.

437
00:23:59,228 --> 00:24:01,267
Then he stole General Feihong's identity

438
00:24:02,468 --> 00:24:04,188
and even tried to kill me.

439
00:24:09,307 --> 00:24:10,507
Perhaps God

440
00:24:11,507 --> 00:24:12,628
took pity on me,

441
00:24:13,587 --> 00:24:14,908
giving me another chance at life.

442
00:24:16,228 --> 00:24:17,787
That's how He Yan came to be.

443
00:24:18,787 --> 00:24:19,787
I am He Yan,

444
00:24:20,428 --> 00:24:21,347
but also He Rufei.

445
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,347
I told you I wanted to earn glory.

446
00:24:25,027 --> 00:24:25,787
That wasn't a lie.

447
00:24:26,587 --> 00:24:27,507
Because I have to

448
00:24:28,188 --> 00:24:29,107
rise to his level

449
00:24:29,148 --> 00:24:30,148
to expose his lies

450
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:33,188
and prevent him

451
00:24:34,787 --> 00:24:35,668
from harming

452
00:24:35,747 --> 00:24:36,787
more innocent people.

453
00:24:38,787 --> 00:24:39,908
Anything that belongs to me,

454
00:24:41,307 --> 00:24:42,747
I will reclaim personally.

455
00:24:47,468 --> 00:24:48,468
Xiao Jue, sorry

456
00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:50,787
for keeping it from you.

457
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:53,067
I just didn't know

458
00:24:53,988 --> 00:24:55,067
how to face you.

459
00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:55,948
Only a question.

460
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:57,708
In the Mingshui Battle,

461
00:24:58,628 --> 00:25:00,148
was it you who delayed

462
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:02,827
the reinforcements?

463
00:25:08,747 --> 00:25:09,388
Yes.

464
00:25:10,428 --> 00:25:11,307
I sent

465
00:25:12,107 --> 00:25:13,587
late reinforcements...

466
00:25:14,307 --> 00:25:15,787
30,000 Xiao Army soldiers died,

467
00:25:17,228 --> 00:25:18,868
and my parents died one after another.

468
00:25:19,587 --> 00:25:21,228
There's a conspiracy in the battle. I...

469
00:25:21,267 --> 00:25:22,507
After lying to me for so long,

470
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:24,267
how can you expect me

471
00:25:24,307 --> 00:25:26,067
to believe your one-sided claims?

472
00:25:32,507 --> 00:25:33,107
You're right.

473
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:35,708
I deceived you.

474
00:25:36,587 --> 00:25:37,708
How could I demand

475
00:25:38,428 --> 00:25:39,948
your immediate trust?

476
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:46,708
But I will find evidence

477
00:25:47,628 --> 00:25:48,708
to uncover the truth.

478
00:25:54,107 --> 00:25:55,668
If you don't want to see me again,

479
00:25:58,107 --> 00:25:59,228
