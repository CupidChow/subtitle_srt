=Episode 33=

23
00:01:46,428 --> 00:01:46,948
Your Majesty,

24
00:01:47,588 --> 00:01:48,267
Maningbu

25
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:49,547
is an envoy of Wutuo.

26
00:01:49,907 --> 00:01:50,747
I suggest we

27
00:01:51,307 --> 00:01:52,148
detain him

28
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:54,107
at the embassy

29
00:01:55,068 --> 00:01:56,467
and write to the King of Wutuo,

30
00:01:56,827 --> 00:01:57,948
stating his crimes.

31
00:01:58,267 --> 00:01:59,467
His disposition rests solely

32
00:02:00,107 --> 00:02:01,747
on the King of Wutuo's response.

33
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:05,288
Go.

34
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:10,228
Strip the He family

35
00:02:14,028 --> 00:02:15,068
of their noble titles.

36
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,228
He Yuansheng

37
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:17,867
will be exiled to the border.

38
00:02:20,948 --> 00:02:21,628
Marquis Wu'an.

39
00:02:22,188 --> 00:02:23,948
Technically, you're from the He family.

40
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:25,707
Your family

41
00:02:26,107 --> 00:02:27,028
disguised you as a son.

42
00:02:27,028 --> 00:02:27,908
You've also committed

43
00:02:28,387 --> 00:02:29,068
a capital crime.

44
00:02:29,508 --> 00:02:30,028
Your Majesty,

45
00:02:30,948 --> 00:02:31,667
He Yan never had

46
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:32,707
the right to choose.

47
00:02:33,308 --> 00:02:34,508
She didn't mean to deceive

48
00:02:35,147 --> 00:02:36,107
Your Majesty.

49
00:02:36,427 --> 00:02:36,948
Your Majesty,

50
00:02:37,308 --> 00:02:38,547
Commander Xiao is right.

51
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:39,788
Besides, Marquis Wu'an

52
00:02:39,987 --> 00:02:41,228
is an exceptional talent

53
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:42,948
who has repeatedly

54
00:02:43,228 --> 00:02:44,788
defeated Wutuo's armies

55
00:02:45,188 --> 00:02:46,188
and defended the nation.

56
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:48,308
I implore Your Majesty's mercy.

57
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,228
But even so,

58
00:02:50,707 --> 00:02:51,587
she wasn't entirely

59
00:02:51,788 --> 00:02:53,188
ignorant about this matter.

60
00:02:53,788 --> 00:02:54,987
Instead of behaving,

61
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:56,547
she chose to enlist.

62
00:02:57,028 --> 00:02:58,188
Doesn't she know

63
00:02:58,508 --> 00:02:59,908
this compounds her crimes?

64
00:03:00,468 --> 00:03:01,628
Don't tell me

65
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:02,987
you joined the army

66
00:03:03,427 --> 00:03:05,188
solely out of patriotism.

67
00:03:05,748 --> 00:03:07,068
Not entirely.

68
00:03:10,748 --> 00:03:11,387
Your Majesty.

69
00:03:12,107 --> 00:03:12,908
One day,

70
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:14,667
I overheard my father

71
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,908
arranging a marriage for me.

72
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:17,228
So I fled home.

73
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:19,987
Meanwhile, becoming a great general

74
00:03:20,147 --> 00:03:21,587
had always been my aspiration.

75
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,308
So I went straight to enlist

76
00:03:23,587 --> 00:03:24,707
without hesitation.

77
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:26,387
Why did you enlist again

78
00:03:26,468 --> 00:03:27,707
after you survived death?

79
00:03:28,068 --> 00:03:29,667
Were you waiting for this day

80
00:03:30,147 --> 00:03:31,308
to seek revenge?

81
00:03:31,427 --> 00:03:32,028
Your Majesty,

82
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:33,587
she never intended that.

83
00:03:33,748 --> 00:03:34,827
Let her speak for herself.

84
00:03:40,707 --> 00:03:41,228
Your Majesty,

85
00:03:42,107 --> 00:03:42,827
I do

86
00:03:43,147 --> 00:03:44,628
resent their cruelty,

87
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:45,827
but after all,

88
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,948
they raised me for many years.

89
00:03:48,587 --> 00:03:49,908
I'm no longer in debt

90
00:03:50,387 --> 00:03:52,188
after what has happened to me.

91
00:03:52,547 --> 00:03:53,788
I don't want revenge.

92
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:54,908
Besides,

93
00:03:54,948 --> 00:03:56,267
what would revenge accomplish?

94
00:03:56,587 --> 00:03:57,707
I only wanted

95
00:03:57,948 --> 00:03:59,147
to reclaim my true identity.

96
00:03:59,508 --> 00:04:00,867
That's why I rejoined the army.

97
00:04:01,188 --> 00:04:02,068
If I hadn't

98
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:03,188
uncovered

99
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:04,188
the conspiracy

100
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:05,707
and decided

101
00:04:06,427 --> 00:04:07,908
to seek justice for my deceased

102
00:04:08,107 --> 00:04:08,948
fellow soldiers,

103
00:04:09,547 --> 00:04:10,547
I would have remained

104
00:04:10,788 --> 00:04:12,308
as He Yan of Yezhou Garrison,

105
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:13,628
who would

106
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,068
eventually die

107
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:16,548
as Female General He Yan of Wei.

108
00:04:22,308 --> 00:04:22,952
Your Majesty,

109
00:04:23,227 --> 00:04:24,227
He Yan's merits outweigh

110
00:04:24,827 --> 00:04:25,868
her minor mistakes.

111
00:04:26,347 --> 00:04:27,308
She defended our borders

112
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:28,907
and martial dignity

113
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:30,668
at the Fuyue Army.

114
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:32,227
At Yezhou Garrison,

115
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:33,467
she went around

116
00:04:33,587 --> 00:04:34,668
to defend our territory.

117
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:35,948
It proves that

118
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:38,467
her military resolve has never wavered.

119
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:40,147
Her loyalty to Wei

120
00:04:40,227 --> 00:04:41,387
remains steadfast.

121
00:04:42,227 --> 00:04:43,027
Your Majesty,

122
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:45,267
given her unwavering loyalty to you

123
00:04:45,628 --> 00:04:46,587
and her dedication

124
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:47,868
to serving Wei,

125
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:50,907
please show mercy.

126
00:04:53,188 --> 00:04:53,748
Your Majesty,

127
00:04:53,948 --> 00:04:55,227
Commander Xiao is right.

128
00:04:55,868 --> 00:04:56,467
Marquis Wu'an

129
00:04:56,748 --> 00:04:57,587
helped Your Majesty

130
00:04:57,827 --> 00:04:59,147
purge corrupt officials

131
00:04:59,428 --> 00:05:00,267
today in court.

132
00:05:00,628 --> 00:05:02,387
Why not offset merits against faults

133
00:05:02,548 --> 00:05:03,347
to demonstrate

134
00:05:03,548 --> 00:05:04,748
your appreciation for talent

135
00:05:04,948 --> 00:05:05,707
and your wisdom

136
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:07,948
in just rewards and punishments?

137
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:11,868
What do you say, my ministers?

138
00:05:16,387 --> 00:05:17,108
Your Majesty,

139
00:05:17,868 --> 00:05:18,748
I believe

140
00:05:18,748 --> 00:05:20,467
that General Fengyun and Mr. Chu

141
00:05:20,508 --> 00:05:21,587
make valid arguments.

142
00:05:22,027 --> 00:05:22,748
Marquis Wu'an

143
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:24,548
is truly an exceptional general.

144
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,227
Now that the truth is revealed,

145
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:29,027
General He should be reinstated

146
00:05:29,188 --> 00:05:30,467
to revive the Fuyue Army.

147
00:05:30,988 --> 00:05:31,548
Moreover,

148
00:05:32,068 --> 00:05:33,548
with the truth revealed,

149
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:34,907
I propose

150
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:36,748
rehabilitating the Xiao family

151
00:05:36,948 --> 00:05:38,387
to stabilize military morale.

152
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:47,108
You've rushed

153
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,948
to say all the good things.

154
00:05:50,068 --> 00:05:50,827
Rest assured.

155
00:05:51,347 --> 00:05:52,508
I was merely jesting.

156
00:05:52,707 --> 00:05:53,224
Of course,

157
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,548
I won't let my loyal ministers down.

158
00:05:56,347 --> 00:05:56,948
Mr. Xiao,

159
00:05:57,387 --> 00:05:59,387
I will draft an edict shortly

160
00:05:59,587 --> 00:06:02,548
to rehabilitate
the Xiao family and the Xiao Army.

161
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:10,907
Thank you, Your Majesty.

162
00:06:14,147 --> 00:06:14,948
Marquis Wu'an,

163
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:17,147
you are no less capable than any man.

164
00:06:17,347 --> 00:06:18,948
Resume your title as General Feihong.

165
00:06:19,108 --> 00:06:19,868
I hope you

166
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,227
could uphold Wei's military honor,

167
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:23,748
guard our borders,

168
00:06:23,907 --> 00:06:25,267
and protect our people.

169
00:06:25,827 --> 00:06:26,428
Understood.

170
00:06:27,068 --> 00:06:27,668
Thank you,

171
00:06:28,027 --> 00:06:28,748
Your Majesty.

172
00:06:31,988 --> 00:06:32,587
Chu Zhao,

173
00:06:32,948 --> 00:06:34,267
you helped the generals

174
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:35,787
with Xu Jingfu's case.

175
00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:36,988
You did a good job.

176
00:06:38,027 --> 00:06:39,308
I hereby make you

177
00:06:39,868 --> 00:06:41,267
Vice Director of the Secretariat.

178
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:45,188
Thank you, Your Majesty.

179
00:06:55,508 --> 00:06:56,508
Let me go.

180
00:06:56,827 --> 00:06:58,027
You can't arrest me.

181
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,840
(General Feihong's Mansion)
My son is General Feihong.

182
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,508
Hurry!

183
00:07:01,508 --> 00:07:02,548
Let me go!

184
00:07:03,827 --> 00:07:06,147
My daughter is Marquis Wu'an!

185
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:07,108
Master.

186
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:09,707
You can't take me.

187
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,864

00:07:17,352 --> 00:07:19,528
(Sealed by Wei's

190
00:07:20,308 --> 00:07:20,840
Move.

191
00:07:22,347 --> 00:07:22,984
Hurry up.

192
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:24,552
Go.

193
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:26,108
How dare you!

194
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:27,462
My father is the Chancellor.

195
00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:28,707
Show some respect.

196
00:07:28,988 --> 00:07:30,308
Do you know who I am?

197
00:07:30,508 --> 00:07:32,027
All of you, get out!

198
00:07:33,748 --> 00:07:34,308
Step aside.

199
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:35,467
That's my chest.

200
00:07:36,347 --> 00:07:36,872
Get lost.

201
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:42,467
You... My maids.

202
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:43,068
Let them go.

203
00:07:43,068 --> 00:07:43,587
Move aside.

204
00:07:44,787 --> 00:07:45,508
Miss.

205
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:52,227
Don't take that.

206
00:07:52,232 --> 00:07:53,632
Those are my father's favorites.

207
00:07:53,632 --> 00:07:54,408
Let go.

208
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:57,907
Listen, Miss Xu.

209
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:00,748
Let go.

210
00:08:01,428 --> 00:08:03,347
Xu Jingfu's been thrown into prison,

211
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:05,428
and your property is confiscated.

212
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:06,988
Do you still think

213
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:08,868
you're the chancellor's daughter?

214
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:09,827
He used to

215
00:08:09,868 --> 00:08:11,508
boss us around.

216
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:12,508
Meanwhile,

217
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:14,587
he conspired with enemies.

218
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:16,948
He deserves no chancellor title.

219
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:18,387
Nonsense.

220
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,907
My father will punish you.

221
00:08:21,227 --> 00:08:22,267
Miss Xu,

222
00:08:22,548 --> 00:08:24,707
if Mr. Chu hadn't been kind enough

223
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:26,548
to plead your case to His Majesty,

224
00:08:26,827 --> 00:08:27,988
do you think

225
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,147
you'd still be bossing us around?

226
00:08:30,387 --> 00:08:32,707
You would've been sent to a brothel.

227
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,188
Nonsense.

228
00:08:38,107 --> 00:08:38,747
You...

229
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:40,424
You...

230
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:41,707
Stay away from me.

231
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:43,467
Stay away from me.

232
00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:44,104
Miss.

233
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:46,308
Mr. Chu.

234
00:08:51,188 --> 00:08:52,068
Mr. Chu, I apologize.

235
00:08:52,188 --> 00:08:52,908
I apologize.

236
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:55,188
I apologize.

237
00:08:59,467 --> 00:08:59,987
Hurry.

238
00:09:00,747 --> 00:09:02,188
Arrest them all.

239
00:09:02,548 --> 00:09:03,548
Punish them!

240
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:07,507
Why aren't you speaking?

241
00:09:08,227 --> 00:09:08,827
Could it be...?

242
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:11,948
Could it be that what they said...

243
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:14,308
is true?

244
00:09:17,347 --> 00:09:18,107
No way.

245
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:19,707
No way.

246
00:09:20,747 --> 00:09:21,627
They...

247
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:23,707
They framed my father.

248
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:25,668
I'll kill them.

249
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:27,188
I'll kill them.

250
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:28,392
Pingting.

251
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:29,627
Calm down, Pingting.

252
00:09:29,707 --> 00:09:31,347
Kill them for me.

253
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:32,867
Your father would be worried.

254
00:09:34,188 --> 00:09:35,388
Why are you still here?

255
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:37,587
Get my father out now.

256
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:39,028
Alright, I promise you.

257
00:09:39,347 --> 00:09:39,948
Don't worry.

258
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:40,747
I'll bring

259
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:41,668
your father back.

260
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,227
They're here for work.

261
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:44,707
Come with me first.

262
00:09:44,788 --> 00:09:45,347
Alright?

263
00:09:45,347 --> 00:09:46,268
Why should I leave?

264
00:09:47,028 --> 00:09:48,148
This is my home.

265
00:09:48,548 --> 00:09:49,268
Make them...

266
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:51,188
Make them...

267
00:09:51,788 --> 00:09:53,827
Make them get out of here.

268
00:09:55,627 --> 00:09:56,747
I'm worried about you.

269
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,388
Your father isn't here.

270
00:09:58,587 --> 00:09:59,548
You're alone.

271
00:09:59,788 --> 00:10:00,948
I couldn't be at ease.

272
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,107
Then I couldn't focus on

273
00:10:03,308 --> 00:10:04,467
getting Master out.

274
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:05,668
Come with me.

275
00:10:05,827 --> 00:10:06,472
Okay?

276
00:10:08,627 --> 00:10:09,188
Alright.

277
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:12,148
I... I'll go with you.

278
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:14,428
I... I won't distract you.

279
00:10:15,668 --> 00:10:16,388
Please,

280
00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:18,148
bring my father back.

281
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:19,028
Alright.

282
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:20,388
Sorry for the trouble.

283
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:22,028
I'll take her away.

284
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:23,908
- Understood.
- Understood.

285
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:27,028
Let's go.

286
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:37,115
(Chu Mansion)

287
00:10:46,308 --> 00:10:47,107
Miss Xu.

288
00:10:47,707 --> 00:10:49,308
This is the guest room for you.

289
00:10:49,867 --> 00:10:50,627
If you need

290
00:10:50,627 --> 00:10:51,507
anything,

291
00:10:51,827 --> 00:10:53,227
feel free to tell me.

292
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:56,467
Arrest all those

293
00:10:56,507 --> 00:10:57,308
who framed

294
00:10:57,347 --> 00:10:58,148
my father

295
00:10:58,308 --> 00:10:59,388
and bring my father back.

296
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,107
Once he's out,

297
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:02,148
we can start

298
00:11:02,148 --> 00:11:03,227
planning our wedding.

299
00:11:03,388 --> 00:11:04,028
Don't worry.

300
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:06,227
I'll find a way to save your father.

301
00:11:06,908 --> 00:11:07,467
Pingting.

302
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,507
Settle in for now.

303
00:11:10,507 --> 00:11:11,388
Miss Xu.

304
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:13,788
Please go ahead.

305
00:11:16,188 --> 00:11:16,788
Alright.

306
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:37,107
Your Majesty.

307
00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:39,948
My master shows no remorse

308
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:41,068
for his crimes.

309
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:42,948
Please allow me

310
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:44,507
to visit the prison

311
00:11:44,707 --> 00:11:46,068
and bid him farewell

312
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,268
after the final trial.

313
00:11:50,707 --> 00:11:52,308
And my master's daughter Xu Pingting

314
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:54,428
knows nothing about his deeds.

315
00:11:54,707 --> 00:11:56,347
Please show mercy, Your Majesty.

316
00:12:22,668 --> 00:12:24,308
You never liked Miss Xu.

317
00:12:25,908 --> 00:12:27,268
Why did you plead for her?

318
00:12:28,788 --> 00:12:29,867
You're inviting trouble.

319
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:32,548
Master is arrested,

320
00:12:32,587 --> 00:12:33,268
awaiting trials.

321
00:12:34,268 --> 00:12:35,388
His followers will surely

322
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:36,707
stir things up

323
00:12:37,107 --> 00:12:37,867
in the court.

324
00:12:38,827 --> 00:12:39,627
I am protecting

325
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:40,948
Xu Pingting

326
00:12:41,707 --> 00:12:43,107
to keep those people calm.

327
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:45,107
They'll remain compliant

328
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:46,507
for their own sake.

329
00:12:47,227 --> 00:12:47,747
Besides,

330
00:12:50,908 --> 00:12:52,747
my mother died in despair

331
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,827
because no one offered her help.

332
00:13:16,707 --> 00:13:17,707

00:16:56,068 --> 00:16:57,188
we'll pack immediately

392
00:16:57,227 --> 00:16:57,867
and join you.

393
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,747
They're my comrades.

394
00:17:06,908 --> 00:17:07,787
Be nice.

395
00:17:07,987 --> 00:17:08,588
They're also

396
00:17:08,588 --> 00:17:09,747
my soldiers.

397
00:17:11,188 --> 00:17:11,747
Anyway,

398
00:17:12,027 --> 00:17:12,668
thank you.

399
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:15,828
W-We are...

400
00:17:16,227 --> 00:17:17,388
- Buddies.
- Buddies.

401
00:17:17,948 --> 00:17:19,027
You're buddies.

402
00:17:19,428 --> 00:17:20,787
Are we excluded?

403
00:17:21,547 --> 00:17:22,868
So you had it all planned

404
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:24,428
and didn't tell me.

405
00:17:25,148 --> 00:17:26,628
Luckily, I recognized Feinu.

406
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:27,787
Otherwise,

407
00:17:28,108 --> 00:17:29,507
I would've been fooled.

408
00:17:37,108 --> 00:17:38,067
You couldn't tell?

409
00:17:38,747 --> 00:17:39,828
So you're truly a fool.

410
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:40,908
Xiao Jue.

411
00:17:41,348 --> 00:17:42,787
You haven't changed at all.

412
00:17:43,348 --> 00:17:44,227
Keep defending her.

413
00:17:46,948 --> 00:17:48,188
You were kept in the dark too.

414
00:17:48,428 --> 00:17:49,028
Say something.

415
00:17:50,507 --> 00:17:51,388
The Fuyue Army

416
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:52,227
will always fulfill

417
00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:53,027
the orders

418
00:17:53,027 --> 00:17:54,027
of General Feihong.

419
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:02,547
You are magnanimous, General Yan.

420
00:18:02,668 --> 00:18:03,707
Please forgive us.

421
00:18:06,227 --> 00:18:06,824
Forget it.

422
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:08,188
I am magnanimous.

423
00:18:09,507 --> 00:18:12,108
Give me 10 jin of prenatal tonic

424
00:18:12,148 --> 00:18:13,428
for Xiu.

425
00:18:13,868 --> 00:18:14,707
Then we're cool.

426
00:18:15,348 --> 00:18:16,227
Ten jin?

427
00:18:16,948 --> 00:18:17,576
Yeah.

428
00:18:18,948 --> 00:18:19,747
I can keep

429
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:21,428
the leftovers for next time.

430
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:23,148
Ten jin it is.

431
00:18:23,467 --> 00:18:24,307
Consider it done.

432
00:18:26,227 --> 00:18:28,348
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

433
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:29,948
Yan.

434
00:18:30,148 --> 00:18:31,188
Why would you ask him?

435
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:32,148
I got this.

436
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:33,027
Yan.

437
00:18:33,227 --> 00:18:34,828
So you're General Feihong.

438
00:18:34,987 --> 00:18:36,227
I truly admire you.

439
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:38,760
Commander.

440
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,388
The edict came.

441
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:47,948
(Imperial Edict)
His Majesty

442
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:48,987
decrees

443
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,108
that Xiao Zhongwu,
commander of the Xiao Army,

444
00:18:52,707 --> 00:18:53,908
demonstrated loyalty

445
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,507
and diligence.

446
00:18:55,747 --> 00:18:58,428
He dedicated himself to the nation

447
00:18:58,868 --> 00:19:00,108
until his last breath.

448
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:02,227
Yet he was framed
by treacherous officials

449
00:19:02,348 --> 00:19:03,747
and suffered injustice.

450
00:19:04,027 --> 00:19:05,588
With the villain brought to justice,

451
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:07,148
his name is cleared.

452
00:19:07,588 --> 00:19:08,307
I hereby confer

453
00:19:08,628 --> 00:19:11,307
Xiao Zhongwu the title of
Loyal and Valiant General.

454
00:19:11,868 --> 00:19:14,428
A proper reburial rite
shall be conducted to honor him.

455
00:19:15,027 --> 00:19:15,547
Furthermore,

456
00:19:15,668 --> 00:19:17,868
General Fengyun, Xiao Jue,
shall be promoted

457
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:19,868
as commander of the Xiao Army

458
00:19:19,987 --> 00:19:22,108
to restore its military prestige.

459
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:23,948
By Imperial Decree.

460
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:27,787
- We thank His Majesty.
- We thank His Majesty.

461
00:19:42,868 --> 00:19:45,148
Today, the world will learn about

462
00:19:45,668 --> 00:19:47,428
the injustice you've suffered.

463
00:19:48,428 --> 00:19:51,067
This edict was scheduled to be delivered

464
00:19:51,188 --> 00:19:52,987
by the Chief Eunuch in person.

465
00:19:54,148 --> 00:19:55,707
But I thought you'd be

466
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,067
anticipating.

467
00:19:57,668 --> 00:20:00,148
So I asked for permission
to expedite delivery.

468
00:20:01,948 --> 00:20:02,828
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

469
00:20:05,428 --> 00:20:06,948
I lacked judgment

470
00:20:07,588 --> 00:20:09,747
and became Xu Jingfu's blade in the end.

471
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:11,507
To think...

472
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:13,908
I let the souls of loyal men

473
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:15,787
be wronged.

474
00:20:24,628 --> 00:20:25,188
Farewell.

475
00:20:53,436 --> 00:20:55,374
(Late Father Xiao Zhongwu,
Late Mother Song Wan)

476
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,515
(Xiao Family Ancestral Hall)

477
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:36,747
Ancestors of the Xiao family,

478
00:21:37,507 --> 00:21:39,348
the villain has been brought to justice.

479
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:41,707
The grievances we have suffered

480
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:42,828
are finally redressed.

481
00:21:44,747 --> 00:21:46,108
May all you heroic spirits

482
00:21:46,828 --> 00:21:47,547
rest in peace.

483
00:21:51,307 --> 00:21:53,067
Ancestors of the Xiao family,

484
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:54,747
from now on, we will

485
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:56,707
unite our efforts

486
00:21:57,467 --> 00:21:58,707
to uphold the family honor.

487
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:01,628
And revitalize the Xiao Army.

488
00:22:31,148 --> 00:22:32,188
I once said

489
00:22:33,348 --> 00:22:34,507
that I had found

490
00:22:34,668 --> 00:22:35,668
my soulmate

491
00:22:36,628 --> 00:22:38,027
and promised to bring her here.

492
00:22:38,027 --> 00:22:39,067
(Late Father Xiao Zhongwu,
Late Mother Song Wan)

493
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,388
I brought her here.

494
00:22:41,148 --> 00:22:42,547
She's standing right next to me.

495
00:22:43,908 --> 00:22:44,828
Her name is He Yan.

496
00:22:51,868 --> 00:22:52,747
General Xiao.

497
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,148
(Late Father Xiao Zhongwu)
You gave me the Qinglang Sword

498
00:22:55,747 --> 00:22:57,027
at Xianchang Academy.

499
00:22:57,547 --> 00:22:58,547
Your inspiring words

500
00:22:59,108 --> 00:23:00,067
still echo in my ears.

501
00:23:00,868 --> 00:23:02,108
We've achieved our goal.

502
00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:03,428
And we will

503
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:05,588
stay true to our aspirations.

504
00:23:07,348 --> 00:23:09,188
(Late Father, Late Mother)
General Xiao. Madam.

505
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:10,987
Rest assured.

506
00:23:20,307 --> 00:23:21,707
I will take care of Huaijin.

507
00:23:30,588 --> 00:23:31,868
After the storm comes sunshine.

508
00:23:32,668 --> 00:23:34,467
It seems we'll celebrate a wedding soon.

509
00:23:42,707 --> 00:23:44,388
He impersonated General Feihong.

510
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:45,628
Such audacity!

511
00:23:48,348 --> 00:23:49,707
(Notice: Treason)
They must die.

512
00:23:49,707 --> 00:23:50,588
Execute them.

513
00:23:51,227 --> 00:23:51,747
Deserved it!

514
00:23:51,772 --> 00:23:57,640
(Notice: He Rufei and Xu Jingfu's
Treason Charges)

515
00:24:13,307 --> 00:24:15,507
Sister, you came to see me?

516
00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:19,307
Are you here to mock my downfall?

517
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:21,948
How dare you

518
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:24,948
laugh at me, the general?

519
00:24:32,188 --> 00:24:32,787
He Yan.

520
00:24:33,467 --> 00:24:35,507
I ended up like this

521
00:24:36,027 --> 00:24:37,828
all because of you.

522
00:24:39,148 --> 00:24:40,108
Why is everyone

523
00:24:40,547 --> 00:24:42,908
outraged on your behalf?

524
00:24:43,668 --> 00:24:44,507
What about me?

525
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:49,547
What about me?

526
00:24:51,747 --> 00:24:53,588
You stole my identity

527
00:24:53,948 --> 00:24:55,828
to go to the academy, join the army,

528
00:24:56,547 --> 00:24:57,987
and earn glory.

529
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:00,828
If you weren't

530
00:25:00,908 --> 00:25:02,668
known as the He family's
legitimate heir,

531
00:25:03,027 --> 00:25:05,388
who would've recognized you?

532
00:25:05,668 --> 00:25:07,747
A caged canary from the inner chambers

533
00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:10,388
could never accomplish anything.

534
00:25:11,348 --> 00:25:12,227
But I

535
00:25:12,668 --> 00:25:14,388
am He Rufei.

536
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:15,828
I am

537
00:25:16,428 --> 00:25:18,428
General Feihong.

538
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:24,428
Why deceive yourself?

539
00:25:25,747 --> 00:25:27,188
He Yan got enlisted twice,

540
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:29,828
starting as a rookie every time.

541
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:31,747
She earned

542
00:25:32,227 --> 00:25:33,547
her glory through

543
00:25:33,747 --> 00:25:35,188
relentless training.

544
00:25:35,987 --> 00:25:36,787
She earned

545
00:25:37,467 --> 00:25:38,267
her glory

546
00:25:38,348 --> 00:25:39,987
by risking her life on the battlefield.

547
00:25:40,787 --> 00:25:42,507
You think she stole your thunder?

548
00:25:42,948 --> 00:25:43,948
Weren't you going about

549
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,668
in the camp and court

550
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,148
in that domineering manner

551
00:25:49,227 --> 00:25:50,987
thanks to her achievements?

552
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:56,067
Nonsense!

553
00:25:57,628 --> 00:25:59,108
Who is she?

554
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,108
She's just my substitute.

555
00:26:01,348 --> 00:26:02,707
Everything she possesses now

556
00:26:02,868 --> 00:26:05,348
rightfully belongs to me!

557
00:26:05,707 --> 00:26:06,428
Really?

558
00:26:07,307 --> 00:26:09,267
Then why don't you prove yourself

559
00:26:09,707 --> 00:26:10,787
and start over?

560
00:26:11,388 --> 00:26:13,628
Because you stole my life.

561
00:26:14,027 --> 00:26:15,868
You stole my identity.

562
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:17,227
I've lost all chances.

563
00:26:17,428 --> 00:26:18,188
No.

564
00:26:18,188 --> 00:26:19,428
It's because you dare not.

565
00:26:20,067 --> 00:26:21,307
Nonsense.

566
00:26:21,428 --> 00:26:22,507
You don't have the guts.

567
00:26:24,148 --> 00:26:25,307
But I do.

568
00:26:26,507 --> 00:26:27,507
You keep saying that

569
00:26:27,668 --> 00:26:28,668
I've achieved everything

570
00:26:28,668 --> 00:26:29,948
by posing

571
00:26:30,267 --> 00:26:31,267
as He Rufei.

572
00:26:31,908 --> 00:26:33,428
But after that poisoned tea,

573
00:26:33,787 --> 00:26:35,348
the course of fate changed.

574
00:26:35,668 --> 00:26:36,948
My presence here today

575
00:26:37,707 --> 00:26:39,108
is the ultimate proof.

576
00:26:39,628 --> 00:26:40,787
Whether as He Rufei

577
00:26:40,828 --> 00:26:41,828
or He Yan,

578
00:26:42,188 --> 00:26:43,428
I'm here

579
00:26:44,307 --> 00:26:45,628
to tell you that

580
00:26:47,348 --> 00:26:49,067
regardless of my name

581
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,507
or gender,

582
00:26:54,227 --> 00:26:55,188
I would always

583
00:26:56,108 --> 00:26:58,188
become General Feihong.

584
00:27:04,307 --> 00:27:04,987
Stop!

585
00:27:05,027 --> 00:27:05,868
Come back!

586
00:27:06,148 --> 00:27:07,507
Why are you leaving? Come back!

587
00:27:08,108 --> 00:27:09,227
Don't you want to kill me?

588
00:27:10,348 --> 00:27:11,987
Aren't you here to kill me?

589
00:27:12,148 --> 00:27:12,868
Do it!

590
00:27:13,388 --> 00:27:14,227
You're unworthy.

591
00:27:14,787 --> 00:27:16,467
You'll pay for your crimes.

592
00:27:17,227 --> 00:27:17,787
You will

593
00:27:17,787 --> 00:27:19,027
be executed in public

594
00:27:20,588 --> 00:27:21,747
and be condemned

595
00:27:22,428 --> 00:27:23,787
by all the Wei people.

596
00:27:24,868 --> 00:27:26,388
In the afterworld,

597
00:27:27,307 --> 00:27:28,588
countless fallen souls

598
00:27:28,628 --> 00:27:29,588
of Wei soldiers

599
00:27:30,507 --> 00:27:32,628
and the Xiao Army's warriors

600
00:27:33,507 --> 00:27:35,348
will deliver your final judgment.

601
00:27:40,747 --> 00:27:42,027
You think I'm scared?

602
00:27:43,027 --> 00:27:43,987
Get back here.

603
00:27:44,227 --> 00:27:45,507
That's my life.

604
00:27:45,628 --> 00:27:46,987
You owe me.

605
00:27:47,148 --> 00:27:48,908
They owe me!

606
00:27:49,227 --> 00:27:50,227
I am General Feihong.

607
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:51,747
I am General Feihong.

608
00:27:51,908 --> 00:27:53,828
I am General Feihong!

609
00:27:54,108 --> 00:27:55,188
I am General Feihong.

610
00:27:56,188 --> 00:27:58,668
I am General Feihong.

611
00:28:00,148 --> 00:28:02,027
I am General Feihong.

612
00:28:06,547 --> 00:28:08,348
I am General Feihong. I...

613
00:28:14,843 --> 00:28:18,696
(Court of Judicial Review)

614
00:28:33,108 --> 00:28:33,747
Commander.

615
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:36,747
Ambushing isn't honorable.

616
00:28:37,868 --> 00:28:38,668
All's fair in war.

617
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:47,108
To me,

618
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:48,707
you are just you.

619
00:28:49,547 --> 00:28:50,428
Beyond titles

620
00:28:51,307 --> 00:28:52,307
or names.

621
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:54,948
That's how I feel about you, too.

622
00:29:07,628 --> 00:29:08,267
Miss He.

623
00:29:10,787 --> 00:29:11,588
Mr. Chu.

624
00:29:13,267 --> 00:29:14,027
Miss He.

625
00:29:14,388 --> 00:29:15,707
Why are you here?

626
00:29:16,428 --> 00:29:17,588
To visit an acquaintance.

627
00:29:22,108 --> 00:29:23,467
And why are you here, Mr. Chu?

628
00:29:26,108 --> 00:29:27,148
To see my master.

629
00:30:13,428 --> 00:30:14,067
Master,

630
00:30:14,828 --> 00:30:15,668
I'm here to visit.

631
00:30:30,067 --> 00:30:31,027
Zilan.

632
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:33,588
All these years,

633
00:30:33,868 --> 00:30:36,507
I've been guiding you wholeheartedly

634
00:30:37,388 --> 00:30:38,747
and pouring resources

635
00:30:39,987 --> 00:30:42,148
into your career.

636
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:46,628
How could you repay kindness

637
00:30:46,787 --> 00:30:48,628
with betrayal?

638
00:30:51,108 --> 00:30:52,027
You are mistaken.

639
00:30:53,027 --> 00:30:55,027
You have been nothing but nice to me.

640
00:30:55,868 --> 00:30:56,948
But when it comes

641
00:30:57,828 --> 00:30:59,668
to the interest of our nation,

642
00:30:59,828 --> 00:31:00,707
we both know

643
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,348
what weighs more.

644
00:31:02,908 --> 00:31:03,987
You taught me to be loyal

645
00:31:04,227 --> 00:31:05,428
and to care for the people.

646
00:31:06,027 --> 00:31:06,987
And what happened?

647
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:09,547
You have forgotten

648
00:31:10,428 --> 00:31:11,348
what you once

649
00:31:11,348 --> 00:31:12,628
taught me.

650
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:14,828
As the Chancellor of Wei,

651
00:31:15,227 --> 00:31:17,348
you plotted treason
and framed loyal officials

652
00:31:17,348 --> 00:31:18,307
for personal gain.

653
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:20,188
Therefore, I had no choice

654
00:31:20,787 --> 00:31:23,307
but to prioritize justice
over personal bonds.

655
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,507
You ungrateful wretch

656
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:34,787
and villainous traitor.

657
00:31:35,828 --> 00:31:37,307
How dare you frame

658
00:31:37,388 --> 00:31:40,467
such hypocrisy as noble speech?

659
00:31:40,868 --> 00:31:41,668
I shouldn't have

660
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,547
dragged you out of your messy family

661
00:31:44,668 --> 00:31:47,547
just because you were talented.

662
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:49,437
The truth has been revealed.

663
00:31:50,388 --> 00:31:50,987
Master,

664
00:31:50,987 --> 00:31:52,388
must you persist in your mistakes,

665
00:31:52,628 --> 00:31:53,547
plunging yourself

666
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,148
into an abyss of ruin?

667
00:32:02,908 --> 00:32:04,108
Alright.

668
00:32:05,348 --> 00:32:08,067
You're truly my outstanding disciple,

669
00:32:09,868 --> 00:32:11,787
prioritizing self-preservation.

670
00:32:13,388 --> 00:32:16,747
The disciple surpasses the master.

671
00:32:19,747 --> 00:32:20,747
As your disciple,

672
00:32:22,828 --> 00:32:23,987
I've never sought

673
00:32:24,747 --> 00:32:25,948
to surpass you.

674
00:32:27,188 --> 00:32:28,668
I merely strive for

675
00:32:28,668 --> 00:32:29,588
a clear conscience.

676
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:33,388
But between gratitude and my duties,

677
00:32:34,227 --> 00:32:35,388
for the nation

678
00:32:35,628 --> 00:32:36,787
and the people,

679
00:32:37,507 --> 00:32:38,428
I had no choice

680
00:32:39,027 --> 00:32:40,828
but to betray your nurturing grace.

681
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:54,348
Enough.

682
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:56,948
There is no turning back now.

683
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:08,787
Zilan,

684
00:33:11,628 --> 00:33:14,108
I ask only one thing.

685
00:33:15,267 --> 00:33:16,948
Be nice to my daughter.

686
00:33:20,428 --> 00:33:21,467
Pingting

687
00:33:23,388 --> 00:33:27,227
genuinely likes you.

688
00:33:30,388 --> 00:33:31,948
Miss Xu may like me,

689
00:33:32,828 --> 00:33:34,588
but I've never returned her affections.

690
00:34:35,268 --> 00:34:36,667
But rest assured,

691
00:34:39,187 --> 00:34:40,667
I won't implicate the innocent.

692
00:35:02,363 --> 00:35:05,448
(Chu Mansion)

693
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,187
Having known warmth,

694
00:35:23,467 --> 00:35:24,908
who would willingly let it go?

695
00:35:32,348 --> 00:35:32,868
They say

696
00:35:33,147 --> 00:35:34,268
you turned

697
00:35:34,627 --> 00:35:36,147
against my father in court.

698
00:35:37,107 --> 00:35:38,107
It's a lie.

699
00:35:38,147 --> 00:35:38,696
Right?

700
00:35:41,467 --> 00:35:42,187
It's true.

701
00:35:46,908 --> 00:35:47,507
That day,

702
00:35:48,348 --> 00:35:48,987
when you

703
00:35:49,027 --> 00:35:50,627
promised to save my father,

704
00:35:51,828 --> 00:35:52,908
were you lying to me?

705
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:57,627
Chu Zhao.

706
00:35:58,388 --> 00:36:00,187
My father treated you so well.

707
00:36:00,467 --> 00:36:01,908
He was your master.

708
00:36:02,667 --> 00:36:04,627
How could you betray him?

709
00:36:07,147 --> 00:36:08,467
You imprudent maid!

710
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,348
Miss Xu,

711
00:36:13,348 --> 00:36:14,428
you'd better behave.

712
00:36:14,908 --> 00:36:16,587
Or I wouldn't mind being more imprudent.

713
00:36:18,547 --> 00:36:19,908
How did I betray him?

714
00:36:22,428 --> 00:36:23,107
Pingting,

715
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:24,667
he may have been

716
00:36:24,788 --> 00:36:25,987
a devoted father to you.

717
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:27,187
But to Wei,

718
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:28,987
he was an irredeemable traitor.

719
00:36:29,348 --> 00:36:30,308
Aiding him

720
00:36:30,547 --> 00:36:32,187
would make me a real traitor.

721
00:36:33,027 --> 00:36:33,587
Pingting,

722
00:36:34,388 --> 00:36:36,107
guard your words from now on

723
00:36:36,748 --> 00:36:38,027
lest you bring disaster.

724
00:36:38,828 --> 00:36:39,828
Nonsense.

725
00:36:55,908 --> 00:36:56,788
Now I get it.

726
00:36:58,587 --> 00:36:59,587
Now I get it.

727
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:05,828
You never loved me.

728
00:37:06,908 --> 00:37:08,388
I was stupid enough to think

729
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:10,667
my sincerity had touched you.

730
00:37:11,308 --> 00:37:11,987
Chu Zhao,

731
00:37:12,987 --> 00:37:15,107
have you ever spoken an honest sentence?

732
00:37:16,147 --> 00:37:17,547
You are simply

733
00:37:17,547 --> 00:37:19,308
an ungrateful wretch!

734
00:37:20,067 --> 00:37:20,627
Pingting,

735
00:37:21,428 --> 00:37:22,587
I promised your father

736
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:24,587
to care for you.

737
00:37:25,228 --> 00:37:26,428
Rest assured and stay here.

738
00:37:27,107 --> 00:37:28,627
Who wants your pity?

739
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,027
Escort Miss Xu back.

740
00:37:33,228 --> 00:37:33,788
Understood.

741
00:37:49,908 --> 00:37:51,467
Mr. Chu, you're truly talented,

742
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:52,788
clearly chancellor material.

743
00:37:52,987 --> 00:37:53,987
You flatter me.

744
00:37:54,308 --> 00:37:56,228
Mr. Wei, you overestimate my worth.

745
00:38:00,908 --> 00:38:03,027
Appearance indeed transforms people.

746
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:04,268
Not long ago,

747
00:38:04,268 --> 00:38:05,748
she was a soldier in Yezhou Garrison.

748
00:38:05,748 --> 00:38:06,828
Now, suddenly,

749
00:38:07,027 --> 00:38:08,147
she's become a general.

750
00:38:08,348 --> 00:38:09,627
With General Fengyun's help,

751
00:38:10,268 --> 00:38:11,547
her future is truly promising.

752
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:13,788
She was always a general.

753
00:38:14,348 --> 00:38:15,627
As a gem obscured by dust,

754
00:38:16,107 --> 00:38:17,388
she needs no one's help.

755
00:38:18,868 --> 00:38:19,507
General Feihong.

756
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:21,147
General Fengyun.

757
00:38:24,948 --> 00:38:26,268
I forgot to congratulate you.

758
00:38:26,748 --> 00:38:27,587
Let me make up now.

759
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:29,788
To make up,

760
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,507
empty words won't suffice.

761
00:38:31,948 --> 00:38:32,948
Your salary exceeds mine.

762
00:38:33,147 --> 00:38:35,027
You should treat me to a fine meal.

763
00:38:36,467 --> 00:38:37,627
You've made the request.

764
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:39,948
We certainly shouldn't be stingy.

765
00:38:41,507 --> 00:38:43,107
The traitors were brought

766
00:38:44,027 --> 00:38:45,467
to justice largely with your help.

767
00:38:46,027 --> 00:38:46,547
Let us

768
00:38:47,067 --> 00:38:48,228
treat you to a feast someday.

769
00:38:49,748 --> 00:38:50,868
To dine with General Feihong

770
00:38:50,987 --> 00:38:52,428
and General Fengyun

771
00:38:52,868 --> 00:38:54,147
would be the greatest honor.

772
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:01,587
The court assembly is about to start.

773
00:39:02,027 --> 00:39:03,348
Let's hurry to the hall.

774
00:39:03,828 --> 00:39:05,948
We're sending Maningbu away today.

775
00:39:06,507 --> 00:39:07,547
Let's show him

776
00:39:07,627 --> 00:39:09,228
the morale of us Wei officials.

777
00:39:24,348 --> 00:39:25,027
I received

778
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:27,547
the alliance proposal
of the King of Wutuo.

779
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:29,948
Since Wutuo shows such sincerity,

780
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:31,067
we won't

781
00:39:31,507 --> 00:39:32,987
hold grudges against you.

782
00:39:33,268 --> 00:39:35,268
I will discuss with my ministers

783
00:39:35,348 --> 00:39:36,708
where to set up trade markets.

784
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:38,667
Meanwhile, profits

785
00:39:39,187 --> 00:39:41,147
follow the agreed terms.

786
00:39:41,908 --> 00:39:43,868
Wei takes 70 percent,

787
00:39:44,308 --> 00:39:45,587
Wutuo 30.

788
00:39:45,987 --> 00:39:46,748
You may

789
00:39:47,187 --> 00:39:49,067
return assured, Envoy.

790
00:39:49,868 --> 00:39:52,547
Thank you, Your Majesty.

791
00:40:09,748 --> 00:40:11,908
Wutuo spared no expense

792
00:40:12,228 --> 00:40:13,467
to save Maningbu.

793
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:15,547
His Majesty

794
00:40:15,868 --> 00:40:16,868
did that to dampen

795
00:40:16,868 --> 00:40:17,788
Wutuo's arrogance.

796
00:40:19,308 --> 00:40:20,308
Courtesy before force.

797
00:40:21,147 --> 00:40:23,147
As long as Wutuo doesn't invade,

798
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:25,868
our army and people can take a break.

799
00:40:26,268 --> 00:40:26,987
Our people

800
00:40:27,147 --> 00:40:28,547
can live peacefully.

801
00:40:29,507 --> 00:40:31,187
But the Wutuo troops are cunning.

802
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:32,708
We mustn't relax

803
00:40:32,987 --> 00:40:34,187
our military defenses.

804
00:40:34,547 --> 00:40:36,147
Stay prepared for all changes.

805
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:39,027
Under war's shadow,

806
00:40:39,788 --> 00:40:41,388
people always suffer the most.

807
00:40:42,507 --> 00:40:43,788
If peace reigns,

808
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:46,587
I'd gladly retire.

809
00:40:48,348 --> 00:40:50,268
But I intend to be a great general.

810
00:40:50,987 --> 00:40:51,748
How about this?

811
00:40:52,067 --> 00:40:53,107
I'll support you.
