Focus on training.

Feinu.

25
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:32,060
Go to the capital.

26
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,139
Look into He Rufei.

27
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:34,540
Commander...

28
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:35,299
Look into

29
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:36,500
his days before Mingshui,

30
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:38,060
and monitor

31
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,139
his every move now.

32
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:41,152
Understood.

33
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:51,899
(Xiao)

34
00:02:51,899 --> 00:02:52,416
Mr. He.

35
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,380
You're back.

36
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,060
Mr. Jiang.

37
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,459
May I trouble you

38
00:02:56,899 --> 00:02:57,859
with something?

39
00:02:58,699 --> 00:02:59,980
There is no "trouble".

40
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,380
Just say the word.

41
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:02,100
No problem.

42
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:03,859
You escort agents

43
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,619
must have connections.

44
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,619
Could you

45
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,780
figure something out?

46
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,419
Who has visited

47
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:11,500
Yuhua Temple these years

48
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:12,660
and met Miss He,

49
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,619
who was resting in the rear courtyard?

50
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:16,060
Miss He?

51
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,380
He Rufei's little sister.

52
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:20,060
Mr. Jiang, I know

53
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,540
it sounds abrupt,

54
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,980
but it's important.

55
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,500
Unfortunately,

56
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,660
I can't explain

57
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,500
everything yet.

58
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,500
Escort agents take jobs

59
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,060
without question asked.

60
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,500
Besides, you're my buddy.

61
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,340
Consider it

62
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,139
done.

63
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,780
Thank you.

64
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:57,619
(Before Mingshui Battle,)

65
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,739
(He Rufei was at the Yuhua Temple.)

66
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,299
(So if He Rufei did meet Xu Jingfu,)

67
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,459
(he must have)

68
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,260
(met him at the Yuhua Temple.)

69
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,739
(Mr. Jiang will be able)

70
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:08,859
(to confirm that.)

71
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,499
(Though it's not enough)

72
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,939
(to prove He Rufei's)

73
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:14,819
(involvement in the scheme,)

74
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,700
(at least,)

75
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,739
(it shows the Commander)

76
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:18,780
(that)

77
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,140
(He Rufei is a suspect.)

78
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,259
(Commander)

79
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:24,460
(is investigating for sure)

80
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,379
(and may uncover new leads.)

81
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:32,780
Now,

82
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,020
I just need to hone my skills

83
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,059
and bide my time.

84
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,072
General.

85
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,179
(Stand Tall and See Far)
What's wrong?

86
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:41,140
I found out that

87
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:41,859
a formidable

88
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:43,140
female general fought

89
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:44,379
alongside Xiao Jue.

90
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,819
A female general?

91
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:51,220
What is she like?

92
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:53,100
Extremely skilled

93
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:53,819
and valiant,

94
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,619
coming from Yezhou Garrison.

95
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:56,980
At Jiyang,

96
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,980
she single-handedly

97
00:04:58,059 --> 00:04:59,700
killed Wutuo's commander Huyate.

98
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:02,939
Understood.

99
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:11,340
Could it

100
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:13,700
be her?

101
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,739
No way.

102
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:18,939
She's supposed to be dead.

103
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,100
Better safe

104
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,980
than sorry.

105
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,859
Whether she's He Yan or not,

106
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,419
she has to die.

107
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,700
He.

108
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,540
You've been

109
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,460
running for six hours.

110
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,379
Why don't you take a break?

111
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:55,059
Yeah.

112
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:56,059
Get some rest.

113
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,700
If you keep running...

114
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,700
I'm fine. Not tired yet.

115
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,059
Have some water

116
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:01,939
and eat.

117
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,460
I can skip

118
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,739
a meal.

119
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,020
But you haven't

120
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:08,220
eaten for ages.

121
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,088
Yeah.

122
00:06:10,059 --> 00:06:10,700
S-Stop...

123
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,140
S-Stop training.

124
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,819
At least eat something

125
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:14,700
and take a break.

126
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:15,900
If you keep...

127
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,152
This is...

128
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:21,499
- S-Stop training.
- He.

129
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,540
He.

130
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:25,340
Wait.

131
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:27,819
S-Stop...

132
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:31,419
Still running?

133
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,580
H-He's...

134
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,460
still training?

135
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,939
Take a break.

136
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,460
I bet he is bothered by something.

137
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,540
That's why

138
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,020
he's tormenting himself.

139
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,900
Mr. Chu.

140
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:16,660
Miss Xu.

141
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:20,980
Is this for my father

142
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:22,259
or me?

143
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,580
I roamed around

144
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,739
during Water God Festival

145
00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:27,020
in Jiyang.

146
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,819
The moment I saw this,

147
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:29,980
I felt that

148
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,020
it suits you perfectly.

149
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,259
I hope you will accept it.

150
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:43,859
Courtesy requires a return.

151
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:45,700
I prepared some pastries.

152
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,140
Would you join me

153
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:49,580
in the pavilion

154
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,379
to have pastries
while admiring the flowers?

155
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,419
Miss Xu.

156
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,580
I...

157
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:57,460
haven't paid respects to Master.

158
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:03,232
But

159
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,859
it won't take

160
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,739
that long.

161
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,140
Perhaps you could go ahead,

162
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,340
and I'll join you

163
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,140
very soon.

164
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:11,840
Alright.

165
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:13,819
See you later.

166
00:08:24,179 --> 00:08:25,020
Zilan.

167
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,060
You're usually reliable,

168
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:30,820
but you have truly disappointed me

169
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,539
with this mission in Jiyang.

170
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:38,976
Master.

171
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:40,499
I failed to kill Chai Anxi,

172
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:41,980
in fear of

173
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,700
alerting our enemies.

174
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,220
What did Chai Anxi say?

175
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,340
He told Xiao Jue

176
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:52,580
what happened in Mingshui.

177
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,379
He said He Rufei

178
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:55,539
made him withhold

179
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,659
Xiao Zhongwu's letter.

180
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:06,060
That's all?

181
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:16,019
Now that he's learned my deepest secret,

182
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:18,779
he won't tell the truth.

183
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,659
He'll be scared that I'd silence him,

184
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:22,980
or

185
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,300
he'll try to blackmail me.

186
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,779
If he doesn't tell the truth,

187
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,259
I will drop the bracelet,

188
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:33,739
and you shall kill him.

189
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,220
Understood.

190
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,259
He also said

191
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:51,980
that you

192
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,259
were the mastermind

193
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,100
of the scheme.

194
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:19,180
Aren't you scared

195
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,659
I'd silence you
because of what you said?

196
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,619
I've always wanted to earn

197
00:10:28,619 --> 00:10:29,539
your utmost trust.

198
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:32,420
But my limitations

199
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,060
made my goal

200
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:34,859
impossible.

201
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,580
This has long troubled me.

202
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,940
Now that I know your secret,

203
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,300
I see it as

204
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:43,460
a double-edged sword.

205
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,580
Though you may silence me

206
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:47,539
as a precaution,

207
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,899
I feel more joy than worry,

208
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:51,899
for I'll defend this secret

209
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,980
with my life,

210
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,619
which bonds us deeper.

211
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,980
I believe

212
00:10:58,739 --> 00:10:59,779
that I am finally

213
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:01,420
qualified

214
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,300
to earn your trust

215
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,460
and share your burdens.

216
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:17,980
Zilan.

217
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,940
I was joking with you.

218
00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:22,340
But I wasn't

219
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,420
joking with you.

220
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:27,659
I failed the mission.

221
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,980
I'll find a way

222
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:30,739
to make amends.

223
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:32,580
Do you have a plan?

224
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:36,899
Though Chai Anxi is dead,

225
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,180
Xiao Jue won't let this go.

226
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,739
In my opinion,

227
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,779
He Rufei was the perpetrator,

228
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,379
and it had

229
00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:46,019
nothing to do with you.

230
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,100
I bet Xiao Jue

231
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:49,659
will investigate He Rufei first.

232
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,300
Once we inform He Rufei

233
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,259
about this,

234
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:54,220
he will surely make a move.

235
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,499
Xiao Jue wants trouble.

236
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,259
Then he can have it.

237
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,259
He left Yezhou

238
00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:02,779
without permission.

239
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,460
We can't let it slide.

240
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:05,984
Also,

241
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:07,180
a young officer

242
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:09,060
performed remarkably well

243
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:10,499
in the Jiyang Battle.

244
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,580
Considering their contributions,

245
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:13,980
if this officer

246
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,580
receives rewards

247
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,980
while Commander Xiao

248
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:18,180
faces punishment,

249
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,139
the veteran troops will surely

250
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,460
grow discontent.

251
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,820
When conflicts arise,

252
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,139
it will make Xiao Jue

253
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:25,539
look incompetent

254
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,499
in leading

255
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:27,779
the troops.

256
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:31,820
That's what you're thinking?

257
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,899
You should know.

258
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:38,019
If this gets out,

259
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,340
it would be a felony.

260
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,420
Your guidance has been vital to me.

261
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:46,739
Without you,

262
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,300
I wouldn't be here today.

263
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:51,060
I swear I'll eliminate

264
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,460
all threats

265
00:12:52,499 --> 00:12:53,220
to you,

266
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:53,859
even if

267
00:12:55,739 --> 00:12:56,820
it costs me

268
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:58,139
my very life.

269
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:21,340
Father.

270
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:24,539
Father.

271
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,499
Pingting.

272
00:13:33,859 --> 00:13:34,899
What brings you here?

273
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:36,859
Can't I just check on you?

274
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:39,940
Father.

275
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,659
Why did you make Mr. Chu kneel?

276
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,340
What did he do wrong?

277
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,659
Let him get up.

278
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,379
I'm waiting

279
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,580
to see flowers with him.

280
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,420
Naughty girl.

281
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,060
I have important matters

282
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:54,379
to discuss with Zilan.

283
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:56,700
Father,

284
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,139
flower viewing

285
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,220
is also important.

286
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,539
Father.

287
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,379
Help me up.

288
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:13,024
Come on.

289
00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:15,019
Be careful.

290
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,499
I've said my piece.

291
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:22,619
Understood.

292
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,200
Go ahead.

293
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:29,580
Thank you.

294
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,512
Master,

295
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,139
I have one more question.

296
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:43,499
Please enlighten me.

297
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:45,580
What is it?

298
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:47,300
What should I tell His Majesty

299
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:48,700
tomorrow?

300
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:52,580
Zilan,

301
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:56,899
His Majesty bears the world
on his shoulders.

302
00:14:57,619 --> 00:14:58,980
As his ministers,

303
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,659
we must share his burdens.

304
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,379
We don't have to

305
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,980
trouble him
with all the trivial matters.

306
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:07,872
Yes, Master.

307
00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:09,460
I

308
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:11,180
understand.

309
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:27,940
Tomorrow, someone will bring you

310
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:31,139
the cure I found for you.

311
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:33,779
Will you remain here,

312
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,619
as a caged bird in shadows,

313
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,539
or go out there

314
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:41,220
as the mighty General Feihong?

315
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:43,739
Think carefully.

316
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:50,180
General Feihong.

317
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,019
Just a second.

318
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:51,899
Let me inform...

319
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,659
Step aside.

320
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:53,499
Master.

321
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:54,176
Master.

322
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:56,224
- Master.
- Chancellor.

323
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,460
General Feihong.

324
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:03,420
This is my mansion.

325
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:05,980
How dare you

326
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:07,300
barge in like this?

327
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:10,379
I apologize.

328
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:12,659
But this is urgent.

329
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,619
Xiao Jue achieved military merits

330
00:16:14,619 --> 00:16:15,379
in Jiyang again.

331
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:16,859
Doesn't it mean that he will

332
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,139
regain influence?

333
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,220
I thought it was something urgent.

334
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,980
He just won a battle, that's all.

335
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,820
Do you have to be so scared?

336
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:29,980
Get up.

337
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:34,899
However,

338
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,539
I did hear something.

339
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:40,139
Chai Anxi didn't die

340
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,739
at Mingshui.

341
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,980
Xiao Jue found him

342
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,100
two days ago.

343
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,580
T-Then...

344
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:49,820
What should I do?

345
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,659
Xiao Jue will bring him

346
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,899
to His Majesty.

347
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,379
Help me, Chancellor.

348
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,139
Rest easy.

349
00:16:56,619 --> 00:16:57,580
I've already

350
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,180
dealt with it.

351
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,499
Chai Anxi is dead.

352
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,059
He won't be coming.

353
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,819
But Xiao Jue

354
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,539
won't let this go.

355
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,620
He'll keep searching for evidence.

356
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,180
You must be careful

357
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,499
not to leave any traces behind.

358
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,940
After all,

359
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,299
the one who contacted Chai Anxi

360
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,739
was you.

361
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:37,660
Rest assured.

362
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:38,779
I won't

363
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,099
let Xiao Jue

364
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,339
get any dirt on me.

365
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:42,779
Good.

366
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,620
After all,

367
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,339
military promotions
hinge on battlefield merits.

368
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,059
Xiao Jue is brave and smart.

369
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:54,259
Halting his ascension

370
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,660
poses genuine difficulty.

371
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:01,380
Then let's end it at once.

372
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,499
Chancellor.

373
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:04,299
Why don't we work with Wutuo

374
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:06,299
and do what we did
to Xiao Zhongwu again?

375
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:17,660
Rest assured.

376
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:19,460
I've devised a plan.

377
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:27,380
Let's ally with Wutuo

378
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,700
to create a diversion.

379
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,420
They'll attack Huayuan.

380
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,140
I'll volunteer to fight

381
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,460
and stage a show with the Wutuo army

382
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,539
while giving them

383
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:37,620
Rundu's Military Defense Maps

384
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,140
in secret

385
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,140
for them to launch a surprise attack.

386
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:40,940
When Rundu

387
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,099
pleads for help,

388
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,660
I'll delay reinforcement.

389
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,980
Xiao Jue won't

390
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:46,499
sit back and do nothing.

391
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,620
We'll set a trap

392
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,779
to kill him

393
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:50,739
there.

394
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,339
Then I will

395
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,019
start preparing.

396
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,220
(I can't tell)

397
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,579
(Chancellor Xu)

398
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,499
(about He Yan yet.)

399
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,539
(Otherwise, he would)

400
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,099
(lose faith in me)

401
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:24,460
(and pin the blame on me.)

402
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:26,019
(That's his plan)

403
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,019
(for explaining)

404
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:27,904
(the Mingshui defeat.)

405
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,180
(Luckily, I'm prepared.)

406
00:19:29,739 --> 00:19:31,380
(He Yan is close to the Eight Warriors)

407
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:32,620
(of Fuyue Army.)

408
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,539
(Seven now serve under me.)

409
00:19:34,739 --> 00:19:36,420
(One commands Rundu Garrison.)

410
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,259
(If she is alive,)

411
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:40,099
(then I can kill)

412
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,339
(all seven warriors in Huayuan)

413
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:43,900
(and use the one in Rundu)

414
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,579
(as bait.)

415
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:46,739
(That's how I manipulate her)

416
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,180
(to go to Rundu.)

417
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,019
(There,)

418
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,499
(she'll meet her demise.)

419
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:53,900
(If she is truly dead,)

420
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,660
(eliminating all Eight Warriors)

421
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,380
(still benefits my cause.)

422
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,299
(Besides,)

423
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:00,460
(I will be able)

424
00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:03,259
(to get rid of Xiao Jue in the process.)

425
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,728
Young Master.

426
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:06,980
Did Chancellor Xu really

427
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,420
plan to kill you?

428
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,180
I've passed this test.

429
00:20:24,499 --> 00:20:25,220
Greater storms

430
00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:26,980
are yet to come, though.

431
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:28,832
Young Master.

432
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:29,779
So what is

433
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:30,819
our next move?

434
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,380
As long as I earn his trust,

435
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,819
I will find out

436
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:36,980
his next move.

437
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:39,380
If he colludes

438
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:40,620
with Wutuo,

439
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:42,059
we'll take precautions.

440
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,232
Huaijin.

441
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:52,660
What's wrong

442
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,700
with you and Miss He?

443
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:55,099
Why aren't you

444
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:55,980
speaking at all?

445
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,299
We are

446
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:00,739
just fine.

447
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,900
Commander Xiao.

448
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,860
You know all the war strategies.

449
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,099
How can you be

450
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:07,499
so clueless with women?

451
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,900
You didn't

452
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,059
seize the opportunity

453
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:10,660
in Chonghuai

454
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,819
and grew increasingly distant.

455
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:13,980
Miss He

456
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:15,779
is a sensitive young lady,

457
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,019
after all.

458
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:18,460
Do you want her

459
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,860
to feel abandoned?

460
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,180
None of your business.

461
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,288
I...

462
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:28,259
I'm offering you advice.

463
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:31,700
Seriously.

at Yuhua Temple.

467
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,860
Besides her parents,

468
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,140
she only met one unexpected visitor.

469
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:06,499
He was not an ordinary man,

470
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,900
but Chancellor Xu Jingfu.

471
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:11,940
He sat with Miss He

472
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:13,460
in the meditation room

473
00:22:13,739 --> 00:22:15,099
(and played chess for a while.)

474
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,980
He Rufei.

475
00:22:17,499 --> 00:22:18,579

(Commander.)

500
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,460
Let me lead the elite squad

501
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:32,819
to draw away Huyate's heavy infantry.

502
00:25:59,284 --> 00:26:02,286
(Xiao)

503
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:25,664
Young Master.

504
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,900
His Majesty sent Yan He
with us to Yezhou.

505
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,819
Is Chancellor Xu

506
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:29,900
behind this?

507
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,420
Yan He is a rising star

508
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,380
from a loyal family.

509
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:34,980
I think His Majesty

510
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:36,299
wants him to tag along.

511
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,700
So, His Majesty

512
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,460
intends to promote Yan He.

513
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:41,259
Then you...

514
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:41,984
It's fine.

515
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,328
He's a military man.

516
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,544
I'm a civil official.

517
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,460
Why would I compete with him?

518
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,900
Are you promoted to

519
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,152
Director of the Ministry of War

520
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:50,620
because you've earned

521
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:51,779
His Majesty's trust?

522
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:57,499
(Mr. Chu.)

523
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:00,259
The battle in Jiyang

524
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,700
strikes me as peculiar.

525
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,299
Did you notice anything fishy

526
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,539
back then?

527
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,539
Your Majesty,

528
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,739
before the battle,

529
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:11,860
many Wutuo spies

530
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,259
infiltrated Jiyang

531
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,460
and even attempted

532
00:28:14,499 --> 00:28:15,860
to abduct the little princess.

533
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:17,539
Thus, I believe that

534
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:18,620
Wutuo people

535
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,499
have been plotting this.

536
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:21,760
They may

537
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,539
wage another war against us.

538
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:25,099
We must be alert.

539
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,739
I also heard that General Fengyun

540
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,140
saved Jiyang single-handedly.

541
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,579
What is

542
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:35,779
your opinion?

543
00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:39,420
In my humble opinion,

544
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,499
General Fengyun
may have defended Jiyang,

545
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,660
but he did leave Yezhou
without permission.

546
00:28:45,579 --> 00:28:47,819
Still, his achievements
outweigh his faults.

547
00:28:48,579 --> 00:28:50,180
I implore you to show leniency

548
00:28:50,499 --> 00:28:51,940
lest others grow discontent.

549
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:53,380
After all,

550
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,299
without General Fengyun

551
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,259
and that

552
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:57,299
brave young soldier,

553
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,779
Jiyang wouldn't have

554
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,059
regained peace so fast.

555
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:01,819
Brave young soldier?

556
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,940
Are you referring to He Yan,

557
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,860
who single-handedly

558
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,900
killed the Wutuo commander

559
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,660
Huyate?

560
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,059
Exactly.

561
00:29:19,499 --> 00:29:20,499
I've also heard that

562
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,660
when Wutuo forces
attacked Yezhou Garrison,

563
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:25,980
He Yan managed to

564
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,380
crush Rida Muzi

565
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,380
to demonstrate our prestige.

566
00:29:30,579 --> 00:29:31,940
To emerge distinguished

567
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:33,700
from General Fengyun's towering shadow,

568
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,539
this young man

569
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,660
truly possesses remarkable skill.

570
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,180
Mr. Chu,

571
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,180
you keep asking for rewards

572
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:46,339
on others' behalf.

573
00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:47,298
What about yourself?

574
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,059
During the battle,

575
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,099
you did a great job by reallocating

576
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,420
the citizens.

577
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:54,432
Tell me.

578
00:29:55,539 --> 00:29:56,779
What reward would you have?

579
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:01,248
Your Majesty,

580
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:02,700
I seek

581
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:04,819
a higher position.

582
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:16,380
You've always disdained

583
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,499
such worldly pursuits

584
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,579
and declined rewards like this.

585
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,019
Why are you

586
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,900
seeking promotion

587
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,900
this time?

588
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,499
Your Majesty,

589
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:32,380
I used to believe

590
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,739
that a minister

591
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,460
only needed to be loyal.

592
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:37,980
But through recent experience,

593
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:39,339
I've realized

594
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,779
that loyalty alone

595
00:30:41,059 --> 00:30:42,620
without actual power is not enough.

596
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,660
Therefore,

597
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,660
I seek greater influence

598
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,259
to better serve Your Majesty

599
00:30:48,499 --> 00:30:49,460
in greater causes.

600
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,779
I see.

601
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,140
Alright then.

602
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,380
I appoint you
as Director of the Ministry of War.

603
00:31:01,739 --> 00:31:02,779
Stay diligent

604
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,220
and uphold your duties.

605
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,739
Do not

606
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,900
let me down.

607
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:13,380
Thank you, Your Majesty.

608
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,980
A ruler

609
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:25,099
never trusts others lightly.

610
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,220
Demonstrating my capabilities

611
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,660
and weaknesses

612
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:29,660
makes me appear

613
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,460
easily controllable

614
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,660
to His Majesty.

615
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,620
When I finally possess power,

616
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,140
I can guide Wei back to

617
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,660
righteous governance.

618
00:31:42,035 --> 00:31:43,259
(Imperial Edict)

619
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:43,779
Young Master,

620
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,220
forgive my boldness,

621
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:47,220
but you shouldn't have asked

622
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:48,259
to reward Miss He.

623
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,499
Chancellor Xu will

624
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:50,539
grow suspicious.

625
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,940
Do you think

626
00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:54,900
I'm so clueless and reckless?

627
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,059
That's not what I meant.

628
00:31:58,059 --> 00:31:58,620
I do

629
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:01,099
harbor personal motives,

630
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,380
but this decree serves

631
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,380
as a stepping stone.

632
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:07,099
Huayuan in jeopardy!

633
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,660
Huayuan in jeopardy!

634
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:11,460
Huayuan in jeopardy!

635
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,660
I heard Wutuo attacked Huayuan.

636
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,499
Is that true?

637
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:20,700
They just lost in Jiyang.

638
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,819
Another attack?

639
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,220
It's confirmed.

640
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,499
Someone just reported to Mr. Shen,

641
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:26,700
and I overheard it.

642
00:32:27,499 --> 00:32:28,860
(Wutuo attacked Huayuan?)

643
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:31,980
(First Jiyang, now Huayuan.)

644
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,739
(The Wutuo army)

645
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:35,220
(seems to be probing)

646
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:36,420
(our military capabilities.)

647
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,620
(They might plan to start a war.)

648
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,620
General Feihong is leading

649
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,760
the troops to Huayuan.

650
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:43,339
He'll surely crush

651
00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:44,499
those Wutuo soldiers!

652
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:46,019
Definitely.

653
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:47,860
