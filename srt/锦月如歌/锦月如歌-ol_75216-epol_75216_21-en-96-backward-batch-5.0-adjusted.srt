=Episode 21=

23
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:43,388
Here comes our female general!

24
00:01:43,388 --> 00:01:44,384
- Welcome.
- Come on.

25
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:45,347
- Have a seat.
- Come on.

26
00:01:45,347 --> 00:01:46,187
Come on, sit.

27
00:01:46,268 --> 00:01:47,347
- Come on.
- Take a seat.

28
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,668
- Alright, let's sit.
- Over here.

29
00:01:49,668 --> 00:01:50,508
Sit here.

30
00:01:50,548 --> 00:01:51,628
Thank you.

31
00:01:52,227 --> 00:01:53,468
Now that I've seen you,

32
00:01:53,787 --> 00:01:55,508
I can boast to my friends.

33
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:56,707
I didn't know

34
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,268
I had become so popular.

35
00:01:58,347 --> 00:01:59,468
This is nothing.

36
00:01:59,748 --> 00:02:00,867
People on the street

37
00:02:01,147 --> 00:02:02,507
will shower you with flowers.

38
00:02:02,947 --> 00:02:04,228
Nowadays in Jiyang,

39
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,027
the one most admired

40
00:02:06,027 --> 00:02:07,027
is Her Highness,

41
00:02:07,348 --> 00:02:08,188
and the second

42
00:02:08,268 --> 00:02:09,108
would be you.

43
00:02:09,108 --> 00:02:09,988
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

44
00:02:10,307 --> 00:02:12,307
But Her Highness is above us,

45
00:02:12,427 --> 00:02:13,707
while you're among us,

46
00:02:13,707 --> 00:02:15,867
which makes us believe

47
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:18,228
that women can achieve greatness, too.

48
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,187
You ladies

49
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:21,467
are no less capable than men.

50
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:23,068
You may not have fought

51
00:02:23,307 --> 00:02:25,348
on the frontline, but your deeds

52
00:02:25,587 --> 00:02:27,388
boosted our morale tremendously.

53
00:02:27,787 --> 00:02:29,467
We simply did small things

54
00:02:29,508 --> 00:02:30,907
under the protection

55
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:33,187
of frontline warriors like you.

56
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:34,587
It's nothing.

57
00:02:35,548 --> 00:02:37,228
No deed is too small.

58
00:02:37,228 --> 00:02:38,508
Everyone has their strengths.

59
00:02:38,747 --> 00:02:40,467
As long as we act with benevolence

60
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,108
and righteousness,

61
00:02:42,388 --> 00:02:43,427
we all deserve respect.

62
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:44,907
Besides,

63
00:02:44,907 --> 00:02:45,747
women enjoy

64
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:47,027
a higher status in Jiyang

65
00:02:47,348 --> 00:02:48,747
thanks to Her Highness.

66
00:02:49,108 --> 00:02:49,948
You ladies must

67
00:02:49,988 --> 00:02:51,707
showcase your talents even more.

68
00:02:51,988 --> 00:02:52,828
You're right.

69
00:02:52,948 --> 00:02:54,467
I've always wanted

70
00:02:54,668 --> 00:02:56,068
to take the imperial exam.

71
00:02:56,348 --> 00:02:58,068
But I never took the exam,

72
00:02:58,108 --> 00:02:59,228
for fear of being judged.

73
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:01,627
Next year, I'll give it a try

74
00:03:01,747 --> 00:03:02,867
to leave no regrets.

75
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:05,668
I wish you success in the exams.

76
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:07,867
A general and a scholar.

77
00:03:08,068 --> 00:03:08,948
I admire you.

78
00:03:09,268 --> 00:03:10,108
Meanwhile, I only

79
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:11,187
want to do business.

80
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:14,147
Most look down on merchants,

81
00:03:14,668 --> 00:03:15,948
but merchants can

82
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:16,948
sustain themselves.

83
00:03:20,388 --> 00:03:21,707
Exquisite embroidery.

84
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:25,307
That's Min'er's starting fund.

85
00:03:25,427 --> 00:03:26,548
That's why she did her best.

86
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:27,788
Don't listen to her.

87
00:03:27,948 --> 00:03:29,348
Miss Wang is getting married.

88
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,427
We're making small items for her.

89
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:32,867
However,

90
00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:34,187
the groom's embroidered pouch

91
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:35,548
is hers to make.

92
00:03:36,147 --> 00:03:37,907
Every stitch carries her affection.

93
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:40,187
We mustn't do it for her.

94
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:41,707
Miss Yan,

95
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:44,027
I want to make a pouch too.

96
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:45,707
Would you teach me?

97
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:48,747
It's for General Fengyun, isn't it?

98
00:03:52,508 --> 00:03:53,828
Let's teach our general.

99
00:03:53,828 --> 00:03:55,508
- Yeah.
- Let's teach her.

100
00:03:55,788 --> 00:03:57,307
- Come on.
- Let me show you.

101
00:03:57,307 --> 00:03:59,508
Insert the needle from below upwards.

102
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,520
Like this.

103
00:04:25,668 --> 00:04:26,508
Done.

104
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:28,627
Let's see.

105
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:30,428
Let's see.

106
00:04:42,387 --> 00:04:44,187
Needlework takes practice.

107
00:04:44,427 --> 00:04:45,468
- Yeah.
- I can teach you

108
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:46,668
step by step.

109
00:04:46,947 --> 00:04:47,787
Yeah.

110
00:04:50,307 --> 00:04:51,147
What about this?

111
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:56,907
Well...

112
00:04:56,907 --> 00:04:58,548
If it's not working,

113
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:00,028
we can try something else.

114
00:05:00,627 --> 00:05:02,307
How about cooking?

115
00:05:02,908 --> 00:05:04,827
General Fengyun would be deeply moved

116
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:06,627
if you cooked for him in person.

117
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,187
But

118
00:05:08,548 --> 00:05:10,507
I've never cooked before.

119
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:13,187
I can't just make plain porridge.

120
00:05:15,427 --> 00:05:16,588
Make some plain noodles.

121
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:17,827
That's the easiest.

122
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:19,507
Yeah, plain noodles.

123
00:05:19,827 --> 00:05:20,668
We can teach you

124
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:21,628
all the recipes.

125
00:05:21,908 --> 00:05:22,827
Give it a try.

126
00:05:22,868 --> 00:05:23,708
Yeah.

127
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:24,988
- You got this.
- You got this.

128
00:05:24,988 --> 00:05:25,908
- Try it.
- Come on.

129
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:26,907
Yeah.

130
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:38,508
Commander.

131
00:05:39,908 --> 00:05:41,187
You've been sorting out

132
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,947
Jiyang's military affairs for days.

133
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:44,307
You must have been tired.

134
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,507
I can't starve you.

135
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:47,748
Commander, look.

136
00:05:48,267 --> 00:05:50,988
I made the noodles myself.

137
00:05:51,307 --> 00:05:53,148
Commander, please do me a favor

138
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:54,628
and try it.

139
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:56,107
Please.

140
00:05:57,307 --> 00:05:58,387
Why did you want to cook?

141
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:02,988
I just wanted to do something for you.

142
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,307
(How much salt did you put in this?)

143
00:06:28,947 --> 00:06:29,787
Commander.

144
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:30,628
Is it good?

145
00:06:33,788 --> 00:06:34,628
Yeah.

146
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:37,548
Seems like I have

147
00:06:37,587 --> 00:06:39,588
some talent in cooking, more or less.

148
00:06:57,548 --> 00:06:59,187
Seeing you enjoy it so much,

149
00:06:59,548 --> 00:07:00,548
I'm getting hungry.

150
00:07:01,148 --> 00:07:01,988
Let me...

151
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:15,988
You were saying...?

152
00:07:16,627 --> 00:07:17,467
No...

153
00:07:20,468 --> 00:07:21,308
Nothing.

154
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:28,067
If you like it so much,

155
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:29,668
I'll make more tomorrow.

156
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:04,068
What's wrong?

157
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,427
I'm checking for holes.

158
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:07,668
If there are any,

159
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:09,187
I can mend them.

160
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:16,108
I don't think it's torn anywhere.

161
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,307
Commander, I'll head back.

162
00:08:21,387 --> 00:08:22,228
Rest early.

163
00:08:39,108 --> 00:08:39,948
Commander.

164
00:08:40,627 --> 00:08:42,027
Did you hear

165
00:08:42,747 --> 00:08:43,867
a tearing sound?

166
00:08:54,228 --> 00:08:55,068
No.

167
00:08:55,988 --> 00:08:56,828
No?

168
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,228
How did my sleeve get torn?

169
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:18,068
Yeah, it's torn.

170
00:09:18,348 --> 00:09:19,428
Hurry and take it off.

171
00:09:20,547 --> 00:09:21,507
Come on.

172
00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:22,547
What...?

173
00:09:22,547 --> 00:09:23,708
Is it necessary?

174
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,428
It's fine. Take it off.

175
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:26,907
No need, seriously.

176
00:09:26,988 --> 00:09:27,828
Take it off.

177
00:09:35,188 --> 00:09:36,028
Do you think

178
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,048
he misunderstood something?

179
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:41,308
Why is he so flustered?

180
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:54,747
What's the rush?

181
00:09:55,147 --> 00:09:55,988
Is something wrong?

182
00:09:57,787 --> 00:09:58,627
Commander.

183
00:09:58,667 --> 00:09:59,507
Chai Anxi woke up.

184
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:38,068
Mr. Chai.

185
00:10:38,787 --> 00:10:39,948
When Wutuo attacked Jiyang,

186
00:10:40,387 --> 00:10:41,867
you could've fled amid the chaos,

187
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:43,547
yet you stayed,

188
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,027
showing a resolve to protect the people.

189
00:10:46,787 --> 00:10:47,627
But why

190
00:10:47,907 --> 00:10:49,108
did you betray my father

191
00:10:50,228 --> 00:10:51,068
and Wei?

192
00:10:53,147 --> 00:10:54,147
I didn't betray Wei.

193
00:10:55,828 --> 00:10:57,068
I never betrayed Wei.

194
00:10:59,747 --> 00:11:01,027
I didn't expect it.

195
00:11:02,588 --> 00:11:04,507
I just wanted Xiao Zhongwu dead.

196
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:07,907
I wanted him dead.

197
00:11:08,988 --> 00:11:10,507
My father treated you well.

198
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:13,667
Why did you do that?

199
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:25,747
Is there something we don't know?

200
00:11:26,108 --> 00:11:26,948
Feel free to speak.

201
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:30,028
We'll plead your case
before His Majesty.

202
00:11:30,787 --> 00:11:32,228
He treated me well?

203
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:35,708
That's because he felt guilty.

204
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:38,588
He killed my son.

205
00:11:40,828 --> 00:11:42,988
My son had just reached adulthood.

206
00:11:43,948 --> 00:11:44,788
As far as I know,

207
00:11:45,108 --> 00:11:45,948
your son

208
00:11:46,308 --> 00:11:47,468
died on the battlefield.

209
00:11:47,988 --> 00:11:49,988
As a soldier, you should know

210
00:11:50,267 --> 00:11:51,267
that war is merciless.

211
00:11:52,188 --> 00:11:53,387
When soldiers march to war,

212
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:55,507
they embrace death without regrets.

213
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,588
Why would you think

214
00:11:57,588 --> 00:11:58,627
that General Xiao

215
00:11:58,627 --> 00:11:59,867
killed your son?

216
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:02,708
If Xiao Zhongwu hadn't been warlike,

217
00:12:02,907 --> 00:12:03,747
my son

218
00:12:03,747 --> 00:12:05,308
wouldn't have died.

219
00:12:05,547 --> 00:12:07,267
If he truly died in battle,

220
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:08,268
as his father,

221
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:09,828
I'd be immensely proud.

222
00:12:10,348 --> 00:12:11,188
But he died

223
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:12,828
under Xiao Zhongwu's

224
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:14,468
petty schemes.

225
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:21,988
You were supposed to

226
00:12:23,147 --> 00:12:24,708
lead the vanguard at Yanshan.

227
00:12:24,748 --> 00:12:25,588
Why was my son

228
00:12:25,588 --> 00:12:27,188
sent as the vanguard in the end?

229
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,027
He never returned,

230
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,228
yet you built your fame.

231
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,468
You earned your glory by stepping

232
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,308
on my son's corpse.

233
00:12:43,468 --> 00:12:44,547
I remember that battle.

234
00:12:45,588 --> 00:12:46,907
A total of 216

235
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:49,468
Xiao Army soldiers

236
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:52,027
died on the battlefield.

237
00:12:53,747 --> 00:12:54,787
Even though they knew

238
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:55,708
before setting out

239
00:12:56,387 --> 00:12:57,227
that this battle

240
00:12:58,188 --> 00:12:59,348
would likely be fatal,

241
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:03,667
they still volunteered to fight.

242
00:13:05,988 --> 00:13:06,867
Your son,

243
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:09,588
Captain Chai Qian,

244
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:11,988
was one of them.

245
00:13:15,387 --> 00:13:16,227
Do you know

246
00:13:16,627 --> 00:13:18,267
we encountered Wutuo cavalry

247
00:13:19,147 --> 00:13:20,667
on the way to Yanshan?

248
00:13:21,387 --> 00:13:22,468
With 1,000 soldiers,

249
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,988
we fought against 5,000 enemies.

250
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:28,308
I couldn't reach Yanshan in time.

251
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:32,108
Your son volunteered

252
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:36,348
to lead the remaining
215 Xiao Army troops

253
00:13:37,547 --> 00:13:38,787
to Yanshan,

254
00:13:40,188 --> 00:13:42,147
sacrificing themselves to turn the tide.

255
00:13:45,468 --> 00:13:47,468
You're lying.

256
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:51,588
Mr. Chai.

257
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:53,228
As a deputy general,

258
00:13:54,627 --> 00:13:56,348
how could you distrust the commander

259
00:13:56,907 --> 00:13:58,027
who had fought

260
00:13:58,068 --> 00:13:59,308
alongside you for years?

261
00:13:59,988 --> 00:14:01,027
And as a father,

262
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,228
why did you underestimate

263
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:05,988
the son you raised yourself?

264
00:14:17,228 --> 00:14:18,828
Here is the petition

265
00:14:19,988 --> 00:14:21,188
signed by

266
00:14:22,468 --> 00:14:23,907
all 216 Xiao Army soldiers.

267
00:14:43,731 --> 00:14:47,680
(Petition)

268
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,228
Qian,

269
00:15:01,588 --> 00:15:03,348
you volunteered to fight?

270
00:15:07,228 --> 00:15:08,387
I'm sorry.

271
00:15:09,027 --> 00:15:10,547
I'm so sorry.

272
00:15:12,068 --> 00:15:14,027
I wronged General Xiao.

273
00:15:17,228 --> 00:15:19,547
I wronged all the soldiers

274
00:15:20,348 --> 00:15:22,387
of the Xiao Army.

275
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:34,107
General Chai.

276
00:15:34,428 --> 00:15:35,507
You already regret it.

277
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:37,348
Then tell us the truth.

278
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:40,188
In the Mingshui Battle,
the commander died,

279
00:15:40,588 --> 00:15:41,988
and 30,000 soldiers perished.

280
00:15:43,147 --> 00:15:44,308
Was it fate

281
00:15:45,787 --> 00:15:46,747
or a setup?

282
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,348
Beware of He Rufei.

283
00:15:53,428 --> 00:15:56,428
He told me to hold back
General Xiao's plea for help

284
00:15:58,747 --> 00:16:00,108
for a few days.

285
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:04,348
Beware of whom?

286
00:16:07,147 --> 00:16:08,108
He Rufei.

287
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,548
Mr. Chai.

288
00:16:11,907 --> 00:16:14,308
Was anyone else involved?

289
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,747
I only had contact with He Rufei.

290
00:16:18,628 --> 00:16:21,188
But I'm sure
someone in the capital was involved.

291
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:23,787
He sounded like

292
00:16:27,228 --> 00:16:29,507
someone highly influential.

293
00:16:36,308 --> 00:16:37,148
Who could be

294
00:16:37,348 --> 00:16:38,988
more influential than Xu Jingfu

295
00:16:40,387 --> 00:16:41,907
in the court?

296
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:20,947
Congratulations

297
00:17:21,027 --> 00:17:22,188
(Li Kuang, Eight Warriors of Fuyue Army)
on being entitled General Feihong.

298
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,908
He Rufei.

299
00:17:38,668 --> 00:17:39,988
It's you.

300
00:17:40,188 --> 00:17:41,428
In the Mingshui Battle,

301
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:43,628
you made me hold back

302
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:45,628
General Xiao's plea for help,

303
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,708
killing General Xiao

304
00:17:48,428 --> 00:17:50,908
and 30,000 Xiao Army soldiers.

305
00:17:51,388 --> 00:17:53,468
No, I'm not He Rufei.

306
00:17:55,547 --> 00:17:57,027
You're not He Rufei?

307
00:18:34,428 --> 00:18:35,868
Are you He Yan

308
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:37,347
or He Rufei?

309
00:18:47,388 --> 00:18:49,027
(Beware of He Rufei.)

310
00:18:51,027 --> 00:18:52,307
(He made me hold back)

311
00:18:52,347 --> 00:18:53,988
(General Xiao's plea for help)

312
00:18:56,188 --> 00:18:57,708
(for a few days.)

313
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:06,188
(The "He Rufei" Chai Anxi mentioned)

314
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,587
(should be me.)

315
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:11,148
(But I never)

316
00:19:11,148 --> 00:19:12,228
(saw him in private.)

317
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:14,827
(The one who contacted him)

318
00:19:15,428 --> 00:19:16,988
(must have been the real He Rufei.)

319
00:19:18,468 --> 00:19:19,308
(Therefore,)

320
00:19:19,787 --> 00:19:20,708
(He Rufei must have)

321
00:19:20,747 --> 00:19:22,388
(colluded with Xu Jingfu long ago.)

322
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,747
(But why did he
scheme against the Xiao Army?)

323
00:19:26,908 --> 00:19:27,748
(Was my death)

324
00:19:28,388 --> 00:19:30,388
(also part of the scheme?)

325
00:19:42,747 --> 00:19:43,868
(No wonder Xiao Jue)

326
00:19:43,908 --> 00:19:45,148
(took the Qinglang Sword)

327
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:47,307
(and was quite)

328
00:19:47,868 --> 00:19:49,107
(defensive against me)

329
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:50,027
(at Yezhou Garrison,)

330
00:19:50,548 --> 00:19:51,388
(suspecting)

331
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:52,668
(that I was a spy.)

332
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:55,428
(But he didn't know)

333
00:19:56,587 --> 00:19:57,908
(that the He Rufei he knew)

334
00:19:58,388 --> 00:20:00,067
(was not the He Rufei)

335
00:20:00,948 --> 00:20:02,347
(who contacted Chai Anxi.)

336
00:20:08,468 --> 00:20:09,308
(Anyway,)

337
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,067
(I must uncover the truth.)

338
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,587
(Huaijin deserves)

339
00:20:13,347 --> 00:20:14,948
(an explanation.)

340
00:20:35,228 --> 00:20:36,468
Young Master, you're back.

341
00:20:37,787 --> 00:20:38,988
What did Chai Anxi say?

342
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:41,948
Is Chancellor Xu
involved in the Mingshui defeat?

343
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,708
Since you've obtained an answer,

344
00:20:49,988 --> 00:20:51,747
I'll kill Chai Anxi now

345
00:20:52,347 --> 00:20:53,428
to complete the mission.

346
00:20:54,107 --> 00:20:54,947
No.

347
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:56,908
He can't die yet.

348
00:20:58,908 --> 00:20:59,748
Where's Xiao Jue?

349
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:01,429
Went to see Her Highness.

350
00:21:04,787 --> 00:21:05,627
In that case,

351
00:21:06,507 --> 00:21:07,908
we should bid her farewell.

352
00:21:11,827 --> 00:21:14,868
I didn't expect
that you're also leaving Jiyang.

353
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:16,628
Unfortunately,

354
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:18,428
we're going different ways.

355
00:21:19,307 --> 00:21:20,468
We're bound to meet

356
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:22,668
in the imperial court again.

357
00:21:25,107 --> 00:21:26,107
Commander's right.

358
00:21:40,188 --> 00:21:41,067
Why did you

359
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:42,948
ask to speak in private,

360
00:21:43,948 --> 00:21:45,067
even without He Yan?

361
00:21:50,747 --> 00:21:51,628
I need

362
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,587
your help with something.

363
00:21:55,228 --> 00:21:56,068
What is it?

364
00:21:56,267 --> 00:21:57,107
He Yan

365
00:21:57,587 --> 00:21:58,948
joined my ranks

366
00:21:58,988 --> 00:21:59,908
disguised as a man.

367
00:22:00,347 --> 00:22:01,267
You know best

368
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,547
what restrictions women face.

369
00:22:04,388 --> 00:22:05,628
He Yan is patriotic

370
00:22:06,507 --> 00:22:07,668
and has military prowess.

371
00:22:08,587 --> 00:22:10,027
But her true identity

372
00:22:10,027 --> 00:22:11,428
brings unnecessary complications.

373
00:22:11,908 --> 00:22:12,748
Therefore,

374
00:22:13,228 --> 00:22:14,628
she disguised herself as a man

375
00:22:15,027 --> 00:22:15,908
to serve in the army.

376
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,632
We do need to

377
00:22:18,107 --> 00:22:19,468
address this issue.

378
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:21,347
But it's not time yet.

379
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,267
So please help

380
00:22:24,267 --> 00:22:25,708
keep her secret.

381
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:27,747
General Fengyun, rest assured.

382
00:22:28,228 --> 00:22:29,547
You saved Jiyang.

383
00:22:29,868 --> 00:22:30,708
We Jiyang people

384
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:33,267
won't let our saviors face any trouble.

385
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:36,988
Thank you.

386
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:40,867
Xiao Jue.

387
00:22:45,388 --> 00:22:47,267
He Yan is Buwang's only disciple.

388
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:49,787
Though jade needs grinding to glow,

389
00:22:50,307 --> 00:22:51,347
I won't allow

390
00:22:51,827 --> 00:22:53,547
any man to bully or hurt her.

391
00:22:54,747 --> 00:22:57,428
Jiyang will always be her maiden home.

392
00:23:28,868 --> 00:23:29,708
Don't worry.

393
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:30,787
I'll keep your secret

394
00:23:30,948 --> 00:23:33,188
even after I go back to the capital.

395
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:34,587
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

396
00:23:34,948 --> 00:23:36,067
What a pity that you can't

397
00:23:36,507 --> 00:23:37,507
take credit for this.

398
00:23:38,948 --> 00:23:39,948
As long as Jiyang's safe.

399
00:23:40,908 --> 00:23:41,748
Mr. Chu.

400
00:23:42,428 --> 00:23:43,268
Let's stop here.

401
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:45,307
I was in the army.

402
00:23:45,628 --> 00:23:46,948
Night walks don't scare me.

403
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:49,268
Actually,

404
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,148
I just wanted to walk with you.

405
00:23:54,988 --> 00:23:56,468
You still call me "Mr. Chu."

406
00:23:57,027 --> 00:23:58,948
That eases my mind.

407
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:01,668
I didn't know that Commander Xiao would

408
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,228
suspect my master.

409
00:24:04,787 --> 00:24:05,627
By the way,

410
00:24:05,827 --> 00:24:06,827
Yingxiang is holding

411
00:24:06,908 --> 00:24:08,507
the mermaid-silk gown you gave me.

412
00:24:09,507 --> 00:24:11,307
She will take it to your room.

413
00:24:12,188 --> 00:24:13,028
Thank you.

414
00:24:13,668 --> 00:24:14,508
Mr. Chu.

415
00:24:14,827 --> 00:24:16,628
As Xu Jingfu's prized disciple,

416
00:24:17,388 --> 00:24:18,628
you must know

417
00:24:18,908 --> 00:24:20,388
more than you claim

418
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:21,668
about his dealings.

419
00:24:22,547 --> 00:24:23,747
The real question is

420
00:24:24,188 --> 00:24:25,787
how involved you were.

421
00:24:26,787 --> 00:24:29,787
But you stood with Jiyang in crisis.

422
00:24:30,148 --> 00:24:30,988
I believe

423
00:24:31,228 --> 00:24:33,468
that you would never commit treason.

424
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:36,148
I hope you'll stop working

425
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:37,827
for the villain.

426
00:24:41,468 --> 00:24:42,628
Master is a loyal man.

427
00:24:43,507 --> 00:24:44,388
How can I believe

428
00:24:44,868 --> 00:24:46,067
that he'd frame patriots

429
00:24:46,188 --> 00:24:47,148
for no reason?

430
00:24:47,547 --> 00:24:49,148
But Chai Anxi's detailed account

431
00:24:50,027 --> 00:24:51,027
sowed doubts in me...

432
00:24:54,388 --> 00:24:55,228
Never mind.

433
00:24:55,587 --> 00:24:57,507
No matter what lies ahead,

434
00:24:58,228 --> 00:25:00,547
I seek only to act
without regret or guilt.

435
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:02,547
Then I wish you

436
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:04,468
a safe journey.

437
00:25:06,787 --> 00:25:07,627
Miss He,

438
00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:09,507
you truly stand apart from other women.

439
00:25:10,347 --> 00:25:11,187
They

440
00:25:11,747 --> 00:25:12,868
lack your resilience.

441
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:15,307
What they desire

442
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:16,747
is merely to find a match

443
00:25:16,747 --> 00:25:18,468
for marital bliss and peaceful living.

444
00:25:19,148 --> 00:25:20,587
Mr. Chu, your words

445
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:22,027
sound rather condescending.

446
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:23,267
How come?

447
00:25:24,027 --> 00:25:25,708
Men can study literature,

448
00:25:25,908 --> 00:25:26,988
join the military,

449
00:25:27,468 --> 00:25:28,868
or become physicians and merchants.

450
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:30,747
Yet from birth,

451
00:25:31,307 --> 00:25:33,468
women are expected
to be virtuous and demure,

452
00:25:33,747 --> 00:25:35,148
learn needlework and etiquette,

453
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,027
all for marital servitude
and child-rearing.

454
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,547
Whether they want it matters not.

455
00:25:39,827 --> 00:25:40,668
Because all this

456
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:42,507
is deemed natural and rightful.

457
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:46,107
I was small-minded.

458
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:47,988
Miss He,

459
00:25:48,267 --> 00:25:49,107
as a woman,

460
00:25:49,587 --> 00:25:50,988
you empathize

461
00:25:51,107 --> 00:25:51,988
with women's plight.

462
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,787
You dare to pioneer paths

463
00:25:54,228 --> 00:25:55,307
others dare not tread.

464
00:25:55,908 --> 00:25:57,267
I truly admire you.

465
00:25:57,747 --> 00:25:59,948
You find me different

466
00:26:00,547 --> 00:26:02,027
because I've studied,

467
00:26:02,507 --> 00:26:03,547
ventured out,

468
00:26:03,948 --> 00:26:06,228
and even defied conventions
by joining the military,

469
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:07,948
as others might call it.

470
00:26:08,468 --> 00:26:09,547
Yet how many women

471
00:26:09,948 --> 00:26:11,988
share my experiences?

472
00:26:13,347 --> 00:26:14,547
If they too

473
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:15,868
could witness

474
00:26:16,468 --> 00:26:17,988
Yezhou's snows,

475
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,307
Jiyang's waters,

476
00:26:20,908 --> 00:26:22,468
desert moons,

477
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,468
and mountain ranges,

478
00:26:26,148 --> 00:26:26,988
tell me,

479
00:26:27,228 --> 00:26:28,628
would they still tolerate

480
00:26:28,868 --> 00:26:31,067
being confined to petty
domestic squabbles?

481
00:26:31,388 --> 00:26:33,027
Would they still wallow in melancholy

482
00:26:33,547 --> 00:26:34,547
and self-pity?

483
00:26:40,027 --> 00:26:41,267
I wish to blaze

484
00:26:42,107 --> 00:26:43,747
a different trail for you.

485
00:26:47,507 --> 00:26:48,388
What do you think

486
00:26:49,188 --> 00:26:50,028
of this proposal?

487
00:26:55,188 --> 00:26:56,028
I need no one

488
00:26:56,307 --> 00:26:57,147
to blaze a trail

489
00:26:57,468 --> 00:26:58,948
on my behalf.

490
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:00,787
What I truly desire

491
00:27:01,347 --> 00:27:02,708
is someone who'll walk beside me

492
00:27:03,107 --> 00:27:04,148
to blaze a trail together.

493
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:18,027
Then who do you think

494
00:27:18,868 --> 00:27:19,708
could

495
00:27:20,668 --> 00:27:22,027
blaze a trail with you?

496
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,107
Could it be

497
00:27:24,547 --> 00:27:25,387
Commander Xiao?

498
00:27:35,428 --> 00:27:36,268
Commander.

499
00:27:37,747 --> 00:27:38,988
You came back alone

500
00:27:40,547 --> 00:27:41,908
just to bid him farewell?

501
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:53,387
Commander.

502
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:55,347
Chai Anxi

503
00:27:55,988 --> 00:27:56,828
is dead.

504
00:28:27,787 --> 00:28:29,587
We maintained
complete perimeter security

505
00:28:29,988 --> 00:28:30,988
without lapse.

506
00:28:31,507 --> 00:28:32,347
After nightfall,

507
00:28:32,448 --> 00:28:34,067
some cleaners passed through

508
00:28:34,668 --> 00:28:35,628
and suddenly attacked.

509
00:28:36,787 --> 00:28:37,988
We fought fiercely

510
00:28:38,587 --> 00:28:39,948
but failed to stop them.

511
00:28:42,628 --> 00:28:43,468
Commander.

512
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:44,507
I've failed my duty.

513
00:28:44,787 --> 00:28:45,668
Please punish me.

514
00:28:50,787 --> 00:28:51,627
You did your best.

515
00:28:52,468 --> 00:28:53,747
Cheng Lisu and Song Taotao

516
00:28:54,188 --> 00:28:55,468
must be treating the injured.

517
00:28:56,307 --> 00:28:57,307
Seek their medical aid.

518
00:28:58,148 --> 00:28:58,988
Understood.

519
00:29:34,787 --> 00:29:36,228
Commander, look.

520
00:29:37,388 --> 00:29:39,948
This token bears Wutuo's lion emblem.

521
00:29:41,027 --> 00:29:41,867
These assassins

522
00:29:42,307 --> 00:29:43,668
could be Wutuo soldiers.

523
00:29:47,988 --> 00:29:49,027
Wutuo soldiers?

524
00:29:50,908 --> 00:29:52,708
Haven't they retreated after the defeat?

525
00:29:54,188 --> 00:29:55,028
Mr. Chu,

526
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:57,628
you don't know anything about it?

527
00:29:57,948 --> 00:29:58,788
Commander Xiao.

528
00:29:58,988 --> 00:29:59,908
What do you mean?

529
00:30:00,827 --> 00:30:01,667
Haven't I been

530
00:30:02,107 --> 00:30:03,587
with you the whole time?

531
00:30:15,787 --> 00:30:17,948
Chu Zhao is Xu Jingfu's prized disciple.

532
00:30:18,547 --> 00:30:19,787
Are you suspecting him?

533
00:30:20,307 --> 00:30:22,107
The role he has played in this

534
00:30:22,747 --> 00:30:23,628
remains unclear.

535
00:30:24,868 --> 00:30:26,428
But mobilizing Wutuo troops

536
00:30:27,267 --> 00:30:28,827
is beyond his current capabilities.

537
00:30:30,668 --> 00:30:31,508
Commander.

538
00:30:32,827 --> 00:30:33,667
Come in.

539
00:30:37,388 --> 00:30:38,228
Commander.

540
00:30:38,388 --> 00:30:39,228
I'm back.

541
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:40,747
Commander.

542
00:30:40,747 --> 00:30:41,908
I've been thinking.

543
00:30:42,347 --> 00:30:43,468
We can't just let it slide.

544
00:30:44,347 --> 00:30:45,428
Shall we rush

545
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:47,347
to the capital to confront Xu Jingfu?

546
00:30:48,428 --> 00:30:49,468
How can we confront him

547
00:30:49,868 --> 00:30:50,708
without

548
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,188
our key witness?

549
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:54,068
But

550
00:30:54,428 --> 00:30:55,787
we have some other leads.

551
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:58,388
At least, we've confirmed

552
00:30:59,267 --> 00:31:00,148
that He Rufei

553
00:31:00,948 --> 00:31:02,307
was indeed involved.

554
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,628
Xu Jingfu is a cunning old fox.

555
00:31:05,267 --> 00:31:06,107
Then let's

556
00:31:06,628 --> 00:31:08,027
look into He Rufei.

557
00:31:08,747 --> 00:31:09,948
Find out how those two

558
00:31:10,547 --> 00:31:11,387
were connected

559
00:31:11,668 --> 00:31:12,508
before Mingshui.

560
00:31:12,587 --> 00:31:13,427
Understood.

561
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:14,587
No wonder Mr. Cheng

562
00:31:14,587 --> 00:31:15,468
keeps calling

563
00:31:15,468 --> 00:31:16,668
He Rufei ungrateful.

564
00:31:17,187 --> 00:31:18,867
General Xiao treated him so well

565
00:31:19,188 --> 00:31:20,747
and gifted him the Qinglang Sword.

566
00:31:21,787 --> 00:31:22,627
But in the end,

567
00:31:22,988 --> 00:31:23,868
he betrayed us.

568
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:34,587
Anything else?

569
00:31:35,347 --> 00:31:36,187
If not,

570
00:31:36,868 --> 00:31:37,708
I'll take my leave.

571
00:31:50,228 --> 00:31:51,068
Young Master.

572
00:31:51,547 --> 00:31:53,267
Who sent those assassins?

573
00:31:55,107 --> 00:31:55,988
Master, naturally.

574
00:31:57,267 --> 00:31:58,347
I delayed taking action.

575
00:31:58,668 --> 00:31:59,988
Master ran out of patience

576
00:31:59,988 --> 00:32:01,027
and sent assassins.

577
00:32:01,988 --> 00:32:02,948
All I had to do

578
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:05,307
was to stay out of it.

579
00:32:05,868 --> 00:32:07,148
So I went to see Her Highness

580
00:32:07,267 --> 00:32:08,428
to establish an alibi.

581
00:32:13,948 --> 00:32:15,347
(But the truth must also surface.)

582
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:17,307
So I left behind evidence

583
00:32:17,307 --> 00:32:18,188
to guide Xiao Jue.

584
00:32:19,267 --> 00:32:20,267
Just like that,

585
00:32:20,668 --> 00:32:22,428
Xiao Jue will suspect Chancellor Xu.

586
00:32:22,787 --> 00:32:24,188
But he is in the capital.

587
00:32:25,148 --> 00:32:26,827
Wouldn't Xiao Jue suspect

588
00:32:27,228 --> 00:32:29,388
that you did it
on behalf of the Chancellor?

589
00:32:29,428 --> 00:32:30,268
No, he wouldn't.

590
00:32:31,148 --> 00:32:32,507
Xiao Jue knows full well

591
00:32:32,988 --> 00:32:35,307
that Master would never
hand me evidence of colluding

592
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:36,587
with Wutuo people.

593
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:38,388
So, I couldn't possibly

594
00:32:38,428 --> 00:32:39,388
mobilize Wutuo troops.

595
00:32:39,908 --> 00:32:41,587
Even without Chai Anxi's testimony,

596
00:32:42,428 --> 00:32:43,868
Xiao Jue will find other means

597
00:32:44,468 --> 00:32:45,308
to fight Master

598
00:32:45,988 --> 00:32:47,228
and He Rufei to the end.

599
00:32:48,027 --> 00:32:49,388
A pity indeed for Chai Anxi,

600
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:51,307
once a valiant warrior,

601
00:32:51,868 --> 00:32:53,027
now brought to such an end.

602
00:32:53,988 --> 00:32:54,828
Young Master.

603
00:32:55,027 --> 00:32:56,747
Chai Anxi was killed by Wutuo soldiers.

604
00:32:57,908 --> 00:32:59,347
Will Chancellor Xu blame you

605
00:32:59,587 --> 00:33:00,868
for failing his orders?

606
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:04,347
Gain and loss must balance.
Only thus endures.

607
00:33:05,267 --> 00:33:06,507
Had I followed his orders,

608
00:33:07,107 --> 00:33:08,468
we'd miss the secrets.

609
00:33:09,468 --> 00:33:10,308
These secrets

610
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:12,507
and Sun Xiangfu's ledger

611
00:33:13,587 --> 00:33:15,148
prove that Master has betrayed Wei.

612
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,728
(Cui Mansion)

613
00:33:23,307 --> 00:33:24,507
Commander Xiao, Miss He.

614
00:33:24,988 --> 00:33:26,428
Mr. Cheng, Miss Song.

615
00:33:26,948 --> 00:33:27,908
Take care.

616
00:33:28,908 --> 00:33:29,748
I don't know

617
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:30,908
when we'll meet again.

618
00:33:31,507 --> 00:33:33,507
You repelled the Wutuo army

619
00:33:33,787 --> 00:33:34,787
and saved us.

620
00:33:35,468 --> 00:33:36,308
We appreciate it.

621
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:38,976
(Great Virtue)

622
00:33:48,908 --> 00:33:49,748
Yan.

623
00:33:49,908 --> 00:33:51,868
We'll pass through Chonghuai.

624
00:33:52,027 --> 00:33:53,107
Shall we make a stop

625
00:33:53,188 --> 00:33:54,468
and have fun for a few days?

626
00:33:57,555 --> 00:33:59,968
(Wangjiang House)

627
00:34:02,547 --> 00:34:03,948
Passing through Chonghuai,

628
00:34:04,388 --> 00:34:05,868
I finally get to see

629
00:34:05,948 --> 00:34:07,428
the renowned Wangjiang House.

630
00:34:07,868 --> 00:34:08,708
Did you bring

631
00:34:08,828 --> 00:34:09,748
enough money?

632
00:34:10,227 --> 00:34:11,388
You wanted to come.

633
00:34:11,468 --> 00:34:12,507
So, you're paying.

634
00:34:13,227 --> 00:34:15,268
I suggested this trip to lift spirits

635
00:34:15,748 --> 00:34:17,187
because Mr. He seemed troubled.

636
00:34:17,428 --> 00:34:18,268
Once He cheers up,

637
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:19,507
Huaijin

638
00:34:19,587 --> 00:34:20,507
will be happy too.

639
00:34:24,707 --> 00:34:26,147
This place looks pricey.

640
00:34:26,788 --> 00:34:27,707
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

641
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:28,907
No problem.

642
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:30,187
Besides,

643
00:34:30,187 --> 00:34:31,227
we can all chip in

644
00:34:31,428 --> 00:34:32,428
if my money runs short.

645
00:34:32,788 --> 00:34:34,468
Just like back at Ruyun House.

646
00:34:34,707 --> 00:34:35,788
Right, Huaijin?

647
00:34:36,547 --> 00:34:37,468
Leave me out of this.

648
00:34:38,348 --> 00:34:40,187
The famous Ruyun House in the capital?

649
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,637
Why did you visit

650
00:34:41,637 --> 00:34:42,627
without me?

651
00:34:42,627 --> 00:34:44,147
Why would we take you?

652
00:34:44,187 --> 00:34:45,027
You were just a kid.

653
00:34:45,147 --> 00:34:46,227
How old were you?

654
00:34:47,388 --> 00:34:48,228
(Guys,)

655
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:50,428
have you heard of Ruyun House?

656
00:34:51,468 --> 00:34:53,147
Yaojing's biggest brothel.

657
00:34:53,507 --> 00:34:54,347
I've been there.

658
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:55,268
It's overrated.

659
00:34:56,347 --> 00:34:58,707
Young Master Yan is so experienced.

660
00:34:59,308 --> 00:35:00,148
Of course.

661
00:35:03,908 --> 00:35:04,864
You've been there?

662
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:06,987
No.

663
00:35:07,587 --> 00:35:08,427
I lied.

664
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:10,867
Huaijin.

665
00:35:10,948 --> 00:35:11,828
You woke up?

666
00:35:12,547 --> 00:35:13,507
I heard Ruyun House

667
00:35:13,547 --> 00:35:14,667
has a new songstress

668
00:35:14,828 --> 00:35:15,948
named Hua Youxian.

669
00:35:16,507 --> 00:35:17,908
Her stunning look

670
00:35:18,107 --> 00:35:19,348
and heavenly voice

671
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,547
made her the top performer in a month.

672
00:35:21,988 --> 00:35:22,948
Let's go hear her sing

673
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:24,268
after class.

674
00:35:24,468 --> 00:35:25,388
Do you dare?

675
00:35:26,147 --> 00:35:27,468
It's your turn now.

676
00:35:27,627 --> 00:35:28,507
Tell you what...

677
00:35:29,107 --> 00:35:29,947
Forget about Yan He.

678
00:35:30,348 --> 00:35:31,268
He will brag about it

679
00:35:31,388 --> 00:35:32,228
either way.

680
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:33,347
Let's go.

681
00:35:33,868 --> 00:35:35,067
Only cowards back out.

682
00:35:36,027 --> 00:35:37,187
He Rufei, you hear me?

683
00:35:39,748 --> 00:35:40,588
Me too?

684
00:35:41,227 --> 00:35:42,067
Let's go.

685
00:35:42,387 --> 00:35:43,227
With the top student

686
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:44,187
Xiao Huaijin with us,

687
00:35:44,428 --> 00:35:45,988
we won't be punished too harshly

688
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:47,388
even if we get caught.

689
00:35:48,027 --> 00:35:48,867
Let's go.

690
00:35:49,908 --> 00:35:50,788
Let's go.

691
00:35:50,908 --> 00:35:51,748
Come on.

692
00:35:52,107 --> 00:35:53,187
How do we sneak out?

693
00:35:53,868 --> 00:35:54,708
He Rufei.

694
00:35:55,468 --> 00:35:56,308
Keep up.

695
00:35:56,348 --> 00:35:57,188
Don't be a coward.

696
00:36:03,587 --> 00:36:04,428
Climb over here.

697
00:36:09,348 --> 00:36:10,188
Careful.

698
00:36:11,107 --> 00:36:12,227
- Thanks.
- Let's go.

699
00:36:13,468 --> 00:36:14,308
Someone's missing.

700
00:36:15,227 --> 00:36:16,067
Where's He Rufei?

701
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:17,908
I'm here.

702
00:36:24,428 --> 00:36:25,707
Pathetic.

703
00:36:40,428 --> 00:36:41,507
Thank you.

704
00:36:42,147 --> 00:36:42,988
You can't even

705
00:36:43,388 --> 00:36:44,228
climb the wall?

706
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:45,908
I didn't want to come.

707
00:36:46,547 --> 00:36:47,387
Yan He

708
00:36:47,428 --> 00:36:48,547
dragged me along.

709
00:36:50,948 --> 00:36:51,788
Also,

710
00:36:51,988 --> 00:36:53,627
aren't you, the top student,

711
00:36:54,107 --> 00:36:55,667
also sneaking off to the brothel?

712
00:37:00,027 --> 00:37:00,867
What's wrong?

713
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:05,948
Ruyun House

714
00:37:06,707 --> 00:37:08,027
has long intrigued me.

715
00:37:09,388 --> 00:37:10,228
Yan.

716
00:37:11,308 --> 00:37:12,667
You don't look well.

717
00:37:12,788 --> 00:37:14,147
Didn't you sleep well?

718
00:37:15,627 --> 00:37:16,467
It's fine.

719
00:37:16,828 --> 00:37:18,988
It's just some memories resurfacing.

720
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:21,187
Is it about Mr. Liu?

721
00:37:22,268 --> 00:37:24,067
I-I'll stop.

722
00:37:30,308 --> 00:37:31,908
Ruyun House is fascinating.

723
00:37:32,428 --> 00:37:33,268
Huaijin.

724
00:37:33,388 --> 00:37:34,587
Remember our old friends?

725
00:37:44,403 --> 00:37:48,768
(Wangjiang House)

726
00:38:03,828 --> 00:38:04,668
Cheng Lisu.

727
00:38:05,468 --> 00:38:06,587
This is...?

728
00:38:06,908 --> 00:38:07,748
Huaijin.

729
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,187
You remember Yang Mingzhi?

730
00:38:11,347 --> 00:38:13,696
(Yang Mingzhi, Magistrate of Chonghuai)

731
00:38:17,468 --> 00:38:18,468
I'm Yang Mingzhi.

732
00:38:19,107 --> 00:38:20,187
Greetings, General Fengyun.

733
00:38:28,748 --> 00:38:30,948
Mingzhi now serves
as Chonghuai's Magistrate.

734
00:38:31,348 --> 00:38:32,428
We were classmates.

735
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:34,348
So I invited him here to catch up.

736
00:38:40,147 --> 00:38:41,988
Are they enemies or something?

737
00:38:43,147 --> 00:38:45,107
Back at Xianchang Academy,

738
00:38:45,507 --> 00:38:46,988
they were close friends.

739
00:38:47,468 --> 00:38:48,308
Yang Mingzhi

740
00:38:48,308 --> 00:38:50,268
is the only son
of the current Minister of War.

741
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,308
He passed the exams years ago,

742
00:38:52,548 --> 00:38:53,388
yet somehow ended up

743
00:38:53,388 --> 00:38:55,027
as a lowly magistrate in Chonghuai.

744
00:38:55,707 --> 00:38:56,587
Why are they acting

745
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,788
like strangers now?

746
00:38:58,107 --> 00:38:59,067
I'm also curious.

747
00:39:01,227 --> 00:39:02,067
Gentlemen,

748
00:39:02,268 --> 00:39:03,428
fate brought us together

749
00:39:03,587 --> 00:39:04,468
at the academy.

750
00:39:04,587 --> 00:39:06,268
Cleared up your misunderstandings.

751
00:39:06,268 --> 00:39:07,108
Cheng Lisu,

752
00:39:07,468 --> 00:39:08,308
you may not know.

753
00:39:10,027 --> 00:39:11,507
There is no misunderstanding

754
00:39:12,627 --> 00:39:13,667
between us.

755
00:39:19,428 --> 00:39:20,268
Huaijin.

756
00:39:20,868 --> 00:39:21,708
Rest assured.

757
00:39:22,707 --> 00:39:23,868
I'll convince my father

758
00:39:23,948 --> 00:39:25,428
to plead for General Xiao

759
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,027
and urge His Majesty

760
00:39:27,027 --> 00:39:28,067
to find out the truth.

761
00:39:29,507 --> 00:39:30,828
As the Minister of War,

762
00:39:31,468 --> 00:39:32,388
my father

763
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,388
has certain influence.

764
00:39:35,348 --> 00:39:36,188
Mingzhi.

765
00:39:37,748 --> 00:39:38,588
Thank you.

766
00:39:39,468 --> 00:39:41,388
Xiao Zhongwu, as the commander-in-chief,

767
00:39:41,788 --> 00:39:42,828
was reckless,

768
00:39:43,227 --> 00:39:45,147
leading our troops into an ambush.

769
00:39:45,428 --> 00:39:46,507
He was too proud

770
00:39:47,027 --> 00:39:48,388
to seek prompt rescue,

771
00:39:48,948 --> 00:39:51,667
which caused huge casualties.

772
00:39:52,067 --> 00:39:52,907
Xiao Zhongwu

773
00:39:52,948 --> 00:39:54,468
is a sinner to Wei.

774
00:39:55,124 --> 00:39:57,428
(Xiao Mansion)

775
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:58,268
Huaijin.

776
00:39:58,948 --> 00:39:59,868
I broke my promise.

777
00:40:01,268 --> 00:40:02,108
Sorry.

778
00:40:04,428 --> 00:40:06,147
I forced this burden on you.

779
00:40:07,227 --> 00:40:08,308
No need to apologize.

780
00:40:09,828 --> 00:40:11,908
I heard you volunteered
to go to Que City.

781
00:40:14,627 --> 00:40:16,348
Word travels fast, it seems.

782
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:17,588
Are you insane?

783
00:40:20,868 --> 00:40:22,988
I know you want to
restore honor to your father

784
00:40:22,988 --> 00:40:23,868
and the Xiao Army.

785
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:25,988
But it's too risky.

786
00:40:28,187 --> 00:40:29,388
I've made up my mind.

787
00:40:30,176 --> 00:40:31,627
Don't try to dissuade me.

788
00:40:33,988 --> 00:40:34,828
Huaijin.

789
00:40:37,587 --> 00:40:38,587
Have you ever thought

790
00:40:39,707 --> 00:40:40,547
that perhaps

791
00:40:41,187 --> 00:40:42,988
there's no hidden truth?

792
00:40:44,707 --> 00:40:46,948
Maybe General Xiao...

793
00:40:52,308 --> 00:40:53,388
Yang Mingzhi.

794
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:55,507
From now on,

795
00:40:56,748 --> 00:40:58,227
stay out of my sight.

796
00:41:00,244 --> 00:41:05,760
(Xiao Mansion)

797
00:41:11,468 --> 00:41:12,308
Yeah.

798
00:41:12,507 --> 00:41:13,347
No misunderstandings.

799
00:41:14,107 --> 00:41:14,947
In the end,

800
00:41:15,827 --> 00:41:16,667
I'm nothing

801
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:18,187
