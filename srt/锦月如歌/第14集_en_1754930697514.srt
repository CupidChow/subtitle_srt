=Episode 14=

23
00:01:44,712 --> 00:01:45,712
I'm just puzzled

24
00:01:46,592 --> 00:01:48,273
why you haven't joined the Xiao Army.

25
00:01:55,792 --> 00:01:57,033
You're not young anymore.

26
00:01:57,792 --> 00:01:58,833
Retiring from battle

27
00:01:59,312 --> 00:02:00,520
is understandable.

28
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:02,824
I'm no deserter.

29
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:13,312
(Xiao)
This was my son's dagger.

30
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:19,192
I was indeed once

31
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:20,353
a member of the Xiao Army.

32
00:02:23,793 --> 00:02:24,993
But Xiao Zhongwu

33
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:28,393
caused my only son's tragic death,

34
00:02:28,993 --> 00:02:30,793
and my wife died of grief.

35
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,953
I swore before their memorial tablets

36
00:02:36,192 --> 00:02:37,632
that I'd make the Xiao family

37
00:02:39,464 --> 00:02:40,793
suffer complete ruin.

38
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:44,353
So you've been tracking the Xiao Army.

39
00:02:45,993 --> 00:02:46,632
Exactly.

40
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,432
The son shall pay for
the father's debts.

41
00:02:52,432 --> 00:02:54,353
I followed from Yaojing to Que City

42
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,632
to seek revenge against Xiao Jue.

43
00:02:58,152 --> 00:02:58,912
But I never

44
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,273
found the right opportunity.

45
00:03:03,872 --> 00:03:04,553
Perhaps

46
00:03:05,632 --> 00:03:07,393
you'll get your chance soon.

47
00:03:10,592 --> 00:03:11,872
His greatest value lies in

48
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,273
his knowledge of Xiao Jue

49
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,953
and the Xiao Army.

50
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:16,553
As for Lei Hou,

51
00:03:16,872 --> 00:03:18,152
he makes a convenient weapon.

52
00:03:19,152 --> 00:03:20,312
Rida Muzi and Hu Yuanzhong,

53
00:03:20,312 --> 00:03:21,953
these Liehe men are ambitious wolves

54
00:03:22,273 --> 00:03:23,432
(Strong Strength)
with strong military forces.

55
00:03:24,513 --> 00:03:25,752
I leaked information about them

56
00:03:25,793 --> 00:03:26,632
to him.

57
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:28,632
He didn't disappoint me.

58
00:03:29,113 --> 00:03:29,872
He made Lei Hou

59
00:03:30,073 --> 00:03:31,432
collaborate with the Liehe tribe

60
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:32,872
to attack the garrison.

61
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:35,353
A good utilization.

62
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:38,432
Who is this person?

63
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:40,432
His name is Chai Anxi.

64
00:03:41,152 --> 00:03:42,673
He was once Xiao Zhongwu's deputy.

65
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,592
Wasn't he supposed to be dead?

66
00:03:46,073 --> 00:03:47,912
Apart from the Xiao Army matters,

67
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,632
what else did he mention?

68
00:03:51,032 --> 00:03:52,993
Did he say anything about Mingshui?

69
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:03,273
This man's resurrection

70
00:04:03,632 --> 00:04:05,073
is quite suspicious.

71
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,872
Don't get yourself
involved in this mess.

72
00:04:10,513 --> 00:04:11,592
Thank you for the reminder.

73
00:04:12,993 --> 00:04:13,833
Chai Anxi and I

74
00:04:14,192 --> 00:04:15,152
only met once.

75
00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:16,673
I soon returned to the capital.

76
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:18,233
Later, we communicated by letters

77
00:04:18,673 --> 00:04:19,673
until Lei Hou's defeat.

78
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:20,952
Our contact stopped.

79
00:04:21,593 --> 00:04:22,713
Is that all?

80
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:24,593
I won't

81
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:26,312
conceal anything.

82
00:04:28,312 --> 00:04:28,913
Forget it.

83
00:04:29,832 --> 00:04:31,993
Clean up this mess.

84
00:04:32,113 --> 00:04:33,512
Whether it's Lei Hou

85
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:35,392
or Chai Anxi,

86
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,353
eliminate them both.

87
00:04:38,752 --> 00:04:39,512
As you command.

88
00:04:40,993 --> 00:04:42,113
But the clues

89
00:04:42,153 --> 00:04:43,272
about Chai Anxi and Lei Hou

90
00:04:43,832 --> 00:04:44,913
point to Xiao Jue.

91
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:47,593
Seems I'll have to go

92
00:04:47,593 --> 00:04:48,392
to Yezhou Garrison.

93
00:04:49,224 --> 00:04:50,832
What pretext will you use?

94
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,713
Commander Xiao fought this battle well.

95
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:58,473
He deserves rewards.

96
00:05:25,512 --> 00:05:26,952
I underestimated Xiao Jue.

97
00:05:27,632 --> 00:05:30,072
He's more cunning than imagined.

98
00:05:31,593 --> 00:05:32,153
Also,

99
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:33,673
prepare two corpses

100
00:05:33,872 --> 00:05:34,553
similar in build

101
00:05:34,593 --> 00:05:35,793
to Lei Hou.

102
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:37,673
Since I promised Master,

103
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:39,072
I must do it.

104
00:05:39,593 --> 00:05:40,113
Understood.

105
00:05:41,353 --> 00:05:42,473
Master's wording suggests

106
00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:44,353
he's clearly wary of Chai Anxi.

107
00:05:44,752 --> 00:05:45,512
Likely

108
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:47,353
Chai Anxi

109
00:05:47,353 --> 00:05:48,432
has dirt on Master.

110
00:05:50,593 --> 00:05:51,432
I'm curious

111
00:05:52,473 --> 00:05:53,312
what kind of secret

112
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,993
this could be.

113
00:05:58,856 --> 00:06:02,120
(Xiao)

114
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:08,593
Commander.

115
00:06:09,113 --> 00:06:10,192
Are you available now?

116
00:06:12,113 --> 00:06:12,673
Enter.

117
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:41,432
Commander.

118
00:06:42,312 --> 00:06:43,072
It's repaired?

119
00:06:45,432 --> 00:06:47,072
I said I'd thank you.

120
00:06:50,673 --> 00:06:51,713
Are you sure it's thanks,

121
00:06:52,432 --> 00:06:53,153
not an apology?

122
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:57,353
They're basically the same.

123
00:06:57,872 --> 00:06:58,832
When you have time,

124
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:00,233
you can test its tone.

125
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:02,272
Then I'll go train now.

126
00:07:12,593 --> 00:07:13,192
I heard

127
00:07:13,673 --> 00:07:15,153
he spent the pay he saved

128
00:07:15,553 --> 00:07:16,913
over these months on this qin.

129
00:08:04,272 --> 00:08:05,312
- The envoy!
- The envoy!

130
00:08:05,432 --> 00:08:06,473
- The envoy!
- The envoy!

131
00:08:07,913 --> 00:08:08,752
- Wait!
- Hurry!

132
00:08:23,072 --> 00:08:23,673
Sir.

133
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:34,152
Chu Zhao.

134
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:41,833
Sir.

135
00:08:48,912 --> 00:08:49,792
Commander

136
00:08:50,032 --> 00:08:50,713
Xiao Jue

137
00:08:50,872 --> 00:08:51,713
is an expert trainer

138
00:08:51,993 --> 00:08:53,353
and performed well against Liehe.

139
00:08:53,752 --> 00:08:54,752
I'm pleased to grant him

140
00:08:55,073 --> 00:08:55,993
a large sum of money

141
00:08:56,353 --> 00:08:57,433
as a mark of honor.

142
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:00,073
Thank you, Your Majesty.

143
00:09:14,152 --> 00:09:15,953
You must be weary from your journey.

144
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:17,872
I've arranged quarters for you.

145
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,193
Let Feinu

146
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,313
take you there.

147
00:09:21,512 --> 00:09:22,272
Thank you.

148
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:23,632
Please take

149
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:25,752
my maidservant there first.

150
00:09:26,872 --> 00:09:28,473
Earlier, I encountered an acquaintance.

151
00:09:28,872 --> 00:09:29,752
I want to see him.

152
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:31,073
Then

153
00:09:31,632 --> 00:09:32,552
I'll leave you to it.

154
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:36,392
Mr. Chu, you're too generous.

155
00:09:37,032 --> 00:09:37,872
You came here.

156
00:09:38,713 --> 00:09:39,433
It should be

157
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:41,233
my duty to play host.

158
00:09:41,593 --> 00:09:42,672
I hope this simple meal

159
00:09:43,152 --> 00:09:44,272
suits your taste.

160
00:09:44,593 --> 00:09:45,113
Please.

161
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:49,632
Mr. He.

162
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:51,233
Thank you.

163
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,193
Word reached

164
00:09:54,353 --> 00:09:56,113
the capital that a Yezhou recruit

165
00:09:56,752 --> 00:09:58,032
crushed Liehe's spirit.

166
00:09:58,433 --> 00:09:59,073
I knew

167
00:09:59,233 --> 00:09:59,953
it must be you,

168
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,552
so I took this assignment

169
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:02,752
to visit you.

170
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:04,073
By the way,

171
00:10:04,512 --> 00:10:05,993
I heard you suffered severe injuries.

172
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:06,993
How are you now?

173
00:10:07,993 --> 00:10:09,512
Thank you for your concern.

174
00:10:09,593 --> 00:10:10,113
I'm strong.

175
00:10:10,473 --> 00:10:11,032
I'm fine now.

176
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:20,353
Mr. Chu,

177
00:10:21,032 --> 00:10:22,593
you came from the capital.

178
00:10:22,713 --> 00:10:23,632
Have there been

179
00:10:23,672 --> 00:10:24,713
any interesting things

180
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:25,833
lately in the capital?

181
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:27,833
Interesting things?

182
00:10:36,632 --> 00:10:37,160
Mr. Chu?

183
00:10:38,113 --> 00:10:38,632
What is it?

184
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,000
Nothing.

185
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:46,593
Mr. He,

186
00:10:46,993 --> 00:10:48,872
what kind of things
are you referring to?

187
00:10:51,272 --> 00:10:51,872
Mr. Chu,

188
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,113
I hear

189
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:54,993
there's someone in the capital

190
00:10:54,993 --> 00:10:56,912
as renowned as the Commander,
General Feihong.

191
00:10:57,552 --> 00:10:58,313
Tell me,

192
00:10:58,552 --> 00:10:59,552
what kind of person

193
00:11:00,032 --> 00:11:00,993
is General Feihong?

194
00:11:02,353 --> 00:11:04,073
You ask the wrong person.

195
00:11:04,713 --> 00:11:05,593
I live in the capital,

196
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,113
but I'm a civil official.

197
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,313
I'm not acquainted

198
00:11:08,713 --> 00:11:09,433
with him.

199
00:11:13,872 --> 00:11:15,272
Then has anything unusual

200
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:17,512
occurred recently

201
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,113
in the general's house?

202
00:11:20,872 --> 00:11:22,792
Unusual?

203
00:11:25,313 --> 00:11:27,392
General Feihong stopped

204
00:11:27,552 --> 00:11:28,313
wearing his mask,

205
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,313
revealing his true face.

206
00:11:32,912 --> 00:11:34,313
He's peerless in martial arts,

207
00:11:34,713 --> 00:11:35,313
and he is also

208
00:11:35,473 --> 00:11:36,632
strikingly handsome.

209
00:11:36,752 --> 00:11:37,632
Of course.

210
00:11:37,912 --> 00:11:38,752
The stature

211
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:39,632
of our young master

212
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:40,433
is more imposing.

213
00:11:40,872 --> 00:11:42,032
It's just the Mingshui Battle

214
00:11:42,193 --> 00:11:43,193
weakened him,

215
00:11:43,672 --> 00:11:45,272
forcing him to recuperate at home

216
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:46,193
and decline visitors

217
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:47,552
and keeping him

218
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:48,953
from greater feats.

219
00:11:53,032 --> 00:11:53,552
Get out!

220
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:00,032
Rufei.

221
00:12:00,392 --> 00:12:02,632
Why this outburst?

222
00:12:03,392 --> 00:12:04,912
She's already dead.

223
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:08,113
Why does she still haunt me?

224
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,593
I am clearly He Rufei.

225
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:13,272
I am the true General Feihong.

226
00:12:21,872 --> 00:12:23,073
General Feihong

227
00:12:23,392 --> 00:12:24,552
is truly loyal and devoted.

228
00:12:24,752 --> 00:12:25,713
He's a good brother.

229
00:12:26,193 --> 00:12:27,872
He often visits
the Yuhua Temple to light

230
00:12:28,193 --> 00:12:29,672
eternal lamps for his dead sister.

231
00:12:34,632 --> 00:12:36,193
How loyal and devoted

232
00:12:36,193 --> 00:12:37,272
General Feihong is.

233
00:12:40,912 --> 00:12:42,993
Mr. He, why are you so interested

234
00:12:43,073 --> 00:12:43,993
in General Feihong?

235
00:12:47,473 --> 00:12:49,193
He is a role model for our generation,

236
00:12:49,593 --> 00:12:50,672
so I admire him.

237
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,696
Though you serve under Commander Xiao,

238
00:12:54,872 --> 00:12:56,433
you admire General Feihong.

239
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:57,433
Don't you think

240
00:12:57,632 --> 00:12:59,073
Commander Xiao might feel displeased

241
00:12:59,152 --> 00:12:59,752
if he knows?

242
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,193
Our commander

243
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:03,113
is magnanimous.

244
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,233
Then let me toast you

245
00:13:06,672 --> 00:13:07,512
with this wine.

246
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:16,672
Mr. He.

247
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,344
Yeah.

248
00:13:31,752 --> 00:13:32,272
Huaijin,

249
00:13:32,752 --> 00:13:33,640
where did

250
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,193
Miss He go?

251
00:13:35,912 --> 00:13:37,073
She's drinking with Chu Zhao.

252
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:38,552
You know it?

253
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:41,593
I didn't expect you to care so much

254
00:13:41,713 --> 00:13:42,792
about Miss He.

255
00:13:46,473 --> 00:13:47,113
Listen, Huaijin,

256
00:13:47,672 --> 00:13:48,833
that's Chu Zhao!

257
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:50,593
Aren't you worried at all?

258
00:13:52,392 --> 00:13:53,233
Is he that awesome?

259
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:56,552
Although Chu Zhao

260
00:13:56,552 --> 00:13:58,073
serves under Xu Jingfu,

261
00:13:58,473 --> 00:13:59,473
objectively speaking,

262
00:14:00,032 --> 00:14:01,792
he's truly talented

263
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:03,632
and gentlemanly.

264
00:14:03,912 --> 00:14:04,792
Miss He

265
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:06,313
usually encounters burly men

266
00:14:06,473 --> 00:14:08,073
in the military camp.

267
00:14:08,713 --> 00:14:10,632
Though someone is decent-looking,

268
00:14:14,032 --> 00:14:14,552
he is

269
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:16,313
expressionless all day.

270
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:18,233
In my opinion,

271
00:14:18,552 --> 00:14:19,433
Miss He might

272
00:14:20,073 --> 00:14:22,152
get snatched away

273
00:14:22,193 --> 00:14:23,313
by that heartthrob Chu Zhao.

274
00:14:29,473 --> 00:14:29,993
What?

275
00:14:30,473 --> 00:14:31,433
Going to see Miss He?

276
00:14:33,353 --> 00:14:34,193
Don't block my light.

277
00:14:36,616 --> 00:14:37,193
Fine, fine.

278
00:14:37,353 --> 00:14:38,792
Keep pretending to be indifferent.

279
00:14:58,113 --> 00:14:59,656
Mr. Chu.

280
00:15:00,104 --> 00:15:00,754
Yeah.

281
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,433
People say

282
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,713
blood ties

283
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,233
are the hardest to sever.

284
00:15:07,672 --> 00:15:08,953
Do you think

285
00:15:09,313 --> 00:15:10,272
that's true?

286
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,193
If that's true,

287
00:15:14,512 --> 00:15:15,233
why do we

288
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:16,872
even have

289
00:15:16,993 --> 00:15:18,392
a story like Cain and Abel?

290
00:15:22,152 --> 00:15:22,752
(Mother,)

291
00:15:23,073 --> 00:15:24,552
(I learned a new song.)

292
00:15:24,672 --> 00:15:25,593
Let me sing it for you.

293
00:15:28,032 --> 00:15:29,233
Little birds fly,

294
00:15:29,473 --> 00:15:30,752
streams giggle,

295
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,713
- fish chase...
- Who let you in?

296
00:15:36,313 --> 00:15:36,872
Father.

297
00:15:37,752 --> 00:15:39,032
I finished my studies.

298
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,993
Today is Mother's birthday.

299
00:15:41,113 --> 00:15:42,872
I just wanted to celebrate her.

300
00:15:44,473 --> 00:15:46,193
As the He family's eldest son,

301
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,113
don't indulge in feminine affairs.

302
00:15:48,552 --> 00:15:50,073
Have you memorized

303
00:15:50,473 --> 00:15:51,313
the Virtue chapter?

304
00:15:52,193 --> 00:15:53,593
A nobleman's virtue

305
00:15:54,272 --> 00:15:55,392
requires utmost sincerity,

306
00:15:55,713 --> 00:15:56,672
righteousness,

307
00:15:57,672 --> 00:15:58,433
and...

308
00:15:59,073 --> 00:15:59,672
and...

309
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,713
Recite like this

310
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:02,152
and claim your studies are done?

311
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:03,152
Useless!

312
00:16:15,193 --> 00:16:15,792
Mr. He,

313
00:16:18,073 --> 00:16:19,912
this song should be light and cheerful,

314
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,032
but your rendition

315
00:16:21,552 --> 00:16:22,672
sounds so sorrowful.

316
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:29,288
You've heard this song, too?

317
00:16:30,593 --> 00:16:31,233
Long ago,

318
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:33,632
my mother often hummed it.

319
00:16:36,552 --> 00:16:38,193
My poor execution

320
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:40,792
fails to capture

321
00:16:41,073 --> 00:16:43,113
its carefree essence.

322
00:16:43,632 --> 00:16:44,313
Mr. Chu, cheers.

323
00:16:44,473 --> 00:16:45,353
Let's drink.

324
00:16:52,872 --> 00:16:53,392
Come on.

325
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:54,713
Let's keep drinking.

326
00:16:57,953 --> 00:16:58,473
Mr. He.

327
00:16:58,912 --> 00:16:59,496
He...

328
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,673
You were born free-spirited.

329
00:17:04,913 --> 00:17:06,552
Why do you say such despondent words?

330
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:08,832
If something troubles you,

331
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,592
I'll be here to listen.

332
00:17:13,312 --> 00:17:14,153
Mr. Chu.

333
00:17:14,592 --> 00:17:15,913
Why would you say that?

334
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:23,832
I...

335
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:25,552
He Yan.

336
00:17:26,873 --> 00:17:28,233
I am He Yan.

337
00:17:29,352 --> 00:17:30,433
I was born

338
00:17:30,473 --> 00:17:31,633
to roam free in vast seas

339
00:17:31,913 --> 00:17:33,552
and soar across endless skies.

340
00:17:34,272 --> 00:17:35,953
No longer confined by cages.

341
00:17:44,072 --> 00:17:44,584
Come on.

342
00:17:44,913 --> 00:17:45,512
Mr. Chu.

343
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:50,592
Mr. Chu.

344
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:51,953
I hear

345
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:53,992
near Yezhou Garrison

346
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:55,473
lies Mount Baiyue.

347
00:17:55,913 --> 00:17:57,832
Its scenery is breathtaking.

348
00:17:58,112 --> 00:17:58,633
Come on!

349
00:17:58,873 --> 00:18:00,153
Let's drink wine together

350
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:01,153
while admiring the moon.

351
00:18:01,233 --> 00:18:01,832
Mr. He.

352
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:02,376
Let's go.

353
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:03,312
You're drunk.

354
00:18:03,312 --> 00:18:04,032
Let's go back.

355
00:18:04,193 --> 00:18:04,713
Mount Baiyue

356
00:18:04,913 --> 00:18:05,913
won't go anywhere.

357
00:18:06,673 --> 00:18:07,633
Mr. Chu.

358
00:18:07,673 --> 00:18:09,072
I'm not drunk.

359
00:18:09,393 --> 00:18:09,993
Come on!

360
00:18:10,352 --> 00:18:10,952
Mr. He.

361
00:18:17,272 --> 00:18:17,913
Commander Xiao.

362
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:19,433
Perfect timing.

363
00:18:19,873 --> 00:18:20,752
Mr. He and I are going

364
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:22,433
to Mount Baiyue
to drink in the moonlight.

365
00:18:23,153 --> 00:18:23,913
Care to join us?

366
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:25,832
Right.

367
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,193
To Mount Baiyue.

368
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,913
I...

369
00:18:38,393 --> 00:18:39,464
Mr. Chu, if you want,

370
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:40,552
you may go alone.

371
00:18:41,312 --> 00:18:42,032
I'll take He Yan

372
00:18:43,512 --> 00:18:44,393
back to sober up.

373
00:18:47,032 --> 00:18:48,233
Where are we going?

374
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:50,728
I want to go
to Mount Baiyue for a drink.

375
00:18:52,752 --> 00:18:53,953
Put me down.

376
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:02,184
This...

377
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:03,656
Where am I?

378
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:05,193
Let me go!

379
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:07,352
I want to see the moon at Mount Baiyue!

380
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,233
Not drunk yet. I can still drink.

381
00:19:15,673 --> 00:19:16,512
Mr. Chu.

382
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:17,272
Come on.

383
00:19:17,552 --> 00:19:18,272
Drink.

384
00:19:18,673 --> 00:19:19,713
Here, drink up.

385
00:19:28,153 --> 00:19:29,713
You and Chu Zhao get along well.

386
00:19:31,673 --> 00:19:32,233
Right.

387
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:33,393
I...

388
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:35,400
I want to see the moon.

389
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,913
I want to see the moon.

390
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:40,112
More wine here.

391
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:54,312
Uncle,

392
00:19:54,312 --> 00:19:55,873
I knew you'd go to snatch her away.

393
00:19:56,272 --> 00:19:56,953
This...

394
00:19:56,953 --> 00:19:57,473
Give me.

395
00:20:07,913 --> 00:20:08,456
Huaijin,

396
00:20:08,713 --> 00:20:09,633
you can't even

397
00:20:09,713 --> 00:20:10,272
pull her away

398
00:20:10,352 --> 00:20:11,433
when she's drunk?

399
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:13,112
Is it her injuries

400
00:20:13,393 --> 00:20:14,312
holding you back?

401
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:19,072
You don't let me drink

402
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,713
because I can't recite
the Virtue chapter?

403
00:20:25,552 --> 00:20:26,272
Father.

404
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:27,953
I can recite it.

405
00:20:28,552 --> 00:20:29,072
Father?

406
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:29,913
How exciting!

407
00:20:34,832 --> 00:20:35,673
What did you call me?

408
00:20:37,072 --> 00:20:38,713
A nobleman's virtue

409
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:40,592
requires utmost sincerity,

410
00:20:40,993 --> 00:20:42,233
righteousness,

411
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:44,032
and compassion.

412
00:20:44,592 --> 00:20:47,233
Cultivate your virtue
before your character.

413
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,713
Virtue enlightens the mind.

414
00:20:49,953 --> 00:20:52,713
Then set your purpose,

415
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:54,953
unshaken by external things.

416
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,352
How's that?

417
00:20:57,512 --> 00:20:58,792
Father, I'm good, right?

418
00:20:59,832 --> 00:21:00,792
First time seeing

419
00:21:01,112 --> 00:21:01,792
a woman

420
00:21:01,832 --> 00:21:02,633
calling you father.

421
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:04,713
What's it feel like?

422
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:05,552
Your daughter

423
00:21:05,552 --> 00:21:06,512
recites texts well.

424
00:21:06,752 --> 00:21:07,673
Quite clever indeed.

425
00:21:07,993 --> 00:21:08,776
- If I...
- Shut up.

426
00:21:10,193 --> 00:21:11,953
Father, you told me to shut up

427
00:21:12,512 --> 00:21:14,473
because I didn't recite it well enough?

428
00:21:15,592 --> 00:21:16,713
I'm not your father.

429
00:21:20,352 --> 00:21:21,233
Father,

430
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:24,552
you want to disown me?

431
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:25,592
Father,

432
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:27,193
I've been working so hard.

433
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:28,752
I've never brought

434
00:21:28,832 --> 00:21:29,673
shame to our family.

435
00:21:30,473 --> 00:21:31,153
Father.

436
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:33,160
Father.

437
00:21:33,512 --> 00:21:35,072
It seems when Miss He was at home,

438
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:36,832
her father was extremely strict.

439
00:21:37,393 --> 00:21:38,473
That's why even when drunk,

440
00:21:38,473 --> 00:21:39,993
she still craves her father's praise.

441
00:21:40,873 --> 00:21:41,713
If you ask me,

442
00:21:41,993 --> 00:21:43,352
just praise her already, Huaijin.

443
00:21:43,832 --> 00:21:44,456
Better yet,

444
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:45,673
give her a reward.

445
00:21:47,153 --> 00:21:47,832
A reward?

446
00:21:53,433 --> 00:21:53,953
Father,

447
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:56,193
other classmates get rewards

448
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:57,272
after being praised.

449
00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:58,312
Do I?

450
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,272
What reward do you want?

451
00:22:14,536 --> 00:22:15,233
Not this.

452
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:18,233
Give me.

453
00:22:19,352 --> 00:22:20,393
Why so harsh?

454
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:21,473
Don't scare Miss He.

455
00:22:22,184 --> 00:22:23,352
By the way,

456
00:22:23,752 --> 00:22:24,713
she's got good taste.

457
00:22:25,112 --> 00:22:25,993
She immediately picked

458
00:22:25,993 --> 00:22:27,072
your most treasured thing.

459
00:22:30,193 --> 00:22:31,176
Have you seen enough?

460
00:22:32,648 --> 00:22:34,056
Don't. I'm here.

461
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,433
Miss He,

462
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:38,913
do you like this pendant?

463
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:40,673
Yes.

464
00:22:41,473 --> 00:22:42,552
Then do you like Chu Zhao?

465
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,184
Chu Zhao...

466
00:22:46,393 --> 00:22:47,032
Cheng Lisu.

467
00:22:48,473 --> 00:22:49,713
I'm doing this for your sake.

468
00:22:51,032 --> 00:22:51,592
Miss He,

469
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:52,953
another question.

470
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:54,312
Do you like Xiao Jue?

471
00:22:56,713 --> 00:22:57,352
Cheng Lisu!

472
00:22:58,032 --> 00:22:58,633
Fine. Got it.

473
00:22:58,792 --> 00:22:59,400
I'll shut up.

474
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:00,104
I'm leaving.

475
00:23:00,272 --> 00:23:01,552
You... seize your chance.

476
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:13,433
Yes.

477
00:23:17,193 --> 00:23:17,913
You like...

478
00:23:18,713 --> 00:23:19,272
what?

479
00:23:21,673 --> 00:23:22,592
Medicine.

480
00:23:24,953 --> 00:23:25,552
Waist?

481
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:44,913
Has Lei Hou been

482
00:23:45,473 --> 00:23:46,072
found?

483
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,193
Our scouts recently reported

484
00:23:48,433 --> 00:23:48,993
the two

485
00:23:49,032 --> 00:23:50,112
headed towards Que City.

486
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,673
Probably returning to Wutuo.

487
00:23:52,112 --> 00:23:53,072
Recall the scouts.

488
00:23:53,352 --> 00:23:54,112
No need to follow.

489
00:23:54,592 --> 00:23:55,112
Also,

490
00:23:55,592 --> 00:23:56,633
send back

491
00:23:56,633 --> 00:23:57,352
the two corpses

492
00:23:57,592 --> 00:23:58,873
as proof of completion.

493
00:23:59,592 --> 00:24:00,193
Tell Master

494
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:01,953
the Lei brothers are dead.

495
00:24:03,512 --> 00:24:04,112
Young Master,

496
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,393
will he believe this?

497
00:24:06,032 --> 00:24:07,032
The Lei brothers

498
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,713
are just expendable pawns.

499
00:24:09,352 --> 00:24:10,552
Master won't care.

500
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:12,633
Chai Anxi

501
00:24:13,713 --> 00:24:14,953
is the real priority.

502
00:24:15,832 --> 00:24:17,673
But Chai Anxi cut contact himself,

503
00:24:18,112 --> 00:24:19,193
meaning he intends to hide.

504
00:24:19,473 --> 00:24:20,153
Tracking him down

505
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:21,552
might take considerable time.

506
00:24:22,072 --> 00:24:23,873
Xiao Jue must be investigating this too.

507
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:24,993
We can hardly

508
00:24:25,032 --> 00:24:26,072
outpace him.

509
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:27,473
Why not let it be?

510
00:24:27,848 --> 00:24:29,032
If we closely watch Xiao Jue,

511
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,552
we'll find Chai Anxi eventually.

512
00:24:31,272 --> 00:24:31,993
If Xiao Jue

513
00:24:32,032 --> 00:24:33,512
finds Chai Anxi first,

514
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:35,153
we'll lose the initiative.

515
00:24:35,832 --> 00:24:37,552
But Xiao Jue's position

516
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:39,473
limits his freedom of action.

517
00:24:39,993 --> 00:24:41,433
We can seize opportunities

518
00:24:41,752 --> 00:24:43,233
and find Chai Anxi before he does.

519
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,384
What about Miss He?

520
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:46,312
Should we watch her?

521
00:24:46,993 --> 00:24:48,193
She's close to Xiao Jue

522
00:24:48,473 --> 00:24:49,832
and likely knows a lot.

523
00:24:50,352 --> 00:24:50,953
No need.

524
00:24:51,713 --> 00:24:52,433
She's invited me

525
00:24:52,433 --> 00:24:53,873
to drink in Mount Baiyue.

526
00:24:55,832 --> 00:24:56,473
I'll try

527
00:24:56,873 --> 00:24:58,153
to get information out of her.

528
00:25:44,032 --> 00:25:44,713
Enter.

529
00:25:48,433 --> 00:25:49,000
You're awake?

530
00:25:51,473 --> 00:25:52,584
You reek of alcohol.

531
00:25:52,872 --> 00:25:53,433
Here.

532
00:25:53,592 --> 00:25:54,272
I

533
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:55,592
prepared hangover soup for you.

534
00:25:56,072 --> 00:25:56,633
Thank you.

535
00:25:57,552 --> 00:25:58,312
Seems you are

536
00:25:58,352 --> 00:25:59,433
fond of this jade pendant.

537
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:00,792
Still clutching it now.

538
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:03,953
Mr. Cheng,

539
00:26:04,673 --> 00:26:06,552
I didn't do anything inappropriate

540
00:26:06,592 --> 00:26:07,592
last night, did I?

541
00:26:07,792 --> 00:26:08,713
Of course not.

542
00:26:08,752 --> 00:26:09,673
You behaved well.

543
00:26:10,993 --> 00:26:12,032
You just let Huaijin

544
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:12,913
experience

545
00:26:12,993 --> 00:26:14,433
how it feels to be a father

546
00:26:14,552 --> 00:26:15,592
and have a good daughter

547
00:26:15,633 --> 00:26:16,473
at such a young age.

548
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:19,512
Father.

549
00:26:20,153 --> 00:26:21,112
I'm not your father.

550
00:26:21,592 --> 00:26:22,272
You remember now?

551
00:26:25,512 --> 00:26:26,233
Hold it tight.

552
00:26:27,072 --> 00:26:27,792
This is the reward

553
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:28,512
after you recited

554
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:30,193
the Virtue chapter.

555
00:26:31,193 --> 00:26:32,032
Reward?

556
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:37,832
I snatched this, didn't I?

557
00:26:39,272 --> 00:26:39,792
Miss He,

558
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:40,953
you're amazing.

559
00:26:41,272 --> 00:26:42,153
After all these years,

560
00:26:42,512 --> 00:26:43,552
this is the first time

561
00:26:43,633 --> 00:26:44,272
I've seen him

562
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:45,153
in such a state.

563
00:26:45,752 --> 00:26:46,592
Having

564
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:47,880
his most precious thing taken

565
00:26:47,993 --> 00:26:49,128
and having to hold the bag.

566
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:51,208
His most precious thing?

567
00:26:54,193 --> 00:26:54,993
Don't tell me

568
00:26:55,993 --> 00:26:56,953
I actually

569
00:26:58,112 --> 00:26:59,112
took liberties with him?

570
00:26:59,312 --> 00:27:00,112
Of course not.

571
00:27:00,112 --> 00:27:01,032
What's wrong with you?

572
00:27:02,032 --> 00:27:03,673
Huaijin is...

573
00:27:06,873 --> 00:27:08,272
I'm talking about this pendant.

574
00:27:09,993 --> 00:27:10,792
This jade pendant

575
00:27:10,953 --> 00:27:12,312
was originally black and white,

576
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:14,072
part of my grandaunt's dowry.

577
00:27:14,673 --> 00:27:15,272
Later,

578
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:17,272
she had it split into two pieces

579
00:27:17,873 --> 00:27:18,832
and gave the white piece

580
00:27:19,032 --> 00:27:19,873
to his elder brother

581
00:27:20,312 --> 00:27:21,752
and the black one to Huaijin.

582
00:27:23,272 --> 00:27:23,993
I've heard

583
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:25,473
his brother's piece

584
00:27:25,673 --> 00:27:27,032
is now with his sister-in-law.

585
00:27:27,752 --> 00:27:28,993
Then Huaijin's piece...

586
00:27:30,312 --> 00:27:31,433
Oh no, oh no.

587
00:27:31,953 --> 00:27:32,512
Last time,

588
00:27:32,512 --> 00:27:33,512
I destroyed his qin.

589
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:34,433
This time, I took

590
00:27:34,512 --> 00:27:35,752
his future wife's pendant.

591
00:27:36,713 --> 00:27:37,832
I must return it!

592
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:40,032
Your soup!

593
00:27:40,072 --> 00:27:40,832
You eat it!

594
00:27:43,144 --> 00:27:44,792
I'm doing good things

595
00:27:45,193 --> 00:27:47,112
without seeking glory.

596
00:28:06,233 --> 00:28:07,032
Morning, Commander.

597
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:15,752
Commander.

598
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:22,473
Are you attending to

599
00:28:23,153 --> 00:28:23,913
your duties?

600
00:28:25,633 --> 00:28:26,352
Get to the point.

601
00:28:28,744 --> 00:28:29,256
Yeah.

602
00:28:31,713 --> 00:28:32,488
Commander,

603
00:28:32,488 --> 00:28:33,552
last night,

604
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:35,393
I was drunk. Completely wasted.

605
00:28:35,832 --> 00:28:36,592
So

606
00:28:36,713 --> 00:28:37,552
everything I said

607
00:28:37,792 --> 00:28:39,193
was pure nonsense.

608
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,913
I shouldn't call you father

609
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:42,713
or take your belongings.

610
00:28:45,512 --> 00:28:46,072
Commander,

611
00:28:46,312 --> 00:28:47,312
please be magnanimous

612
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:48,633
and spare me this time.

613
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:50,512
You're like my second parent.

614
00:28:52,512 --> 00:28:53,064
No.

615
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:54,633
No.

616
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:55,633
I mean

617
00:28:56,272 --> 00:28:57,473
your grace rebuilds my life.

618
00:28:58,592 --> 00:28:59,193
Commander,

619
00:28:59,592 --> 00:29:00,433
Mr. Chu has come.

620
00:29:03,713 --> 00:29:04,393
Let him in.

621
00:29:09,993 --> 00:29:10,953
Drink less.

622
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:12,112
You're part

623
00:29:12,153 --> 00:29:12,993
of the battalion.

624
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:14,953
Calling me like that

625
00:29:17,153 --> 00:29:17,873
is bad enough.

626
00:29:18,752 --> 00:29:19,512
Don't lose face

627
00:29:19,953 --> 00:29:20,752
in front of others.

628
00:29:21,352 --> 00:29:21,884
Yeah.

629
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:27,873
Commander Xiao.

630
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:29,913
Mr. He.

631
00:29:31,832 --> 00:29:32,393
Mr. Chu.

632
00:29:34,393 --> 00:29:35,112
What brings

633
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:36,153
you here?

634
00:29:36,473 --> 00:29:37,713
I came for Mr. He.

635
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:39,433
I couldn't find him

636
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:40,072
in his quarters.

637
00:29:40,552 --> 00:29:42,032
Then I heard he was with you,

638
00:29:42,393 --> 00:29:44,233
so I came to visit.

639
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:46,696
I never thought

640
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:48,433
you were the impatient type.

641
00:29:50,993 --> 00:29:53,193
After all, Mr. He and I go way back.

642
00:29:56,112 --> 00:29:56,713
Is that so?

643
00:29:57,272 --> 00:29:58,696
You're here for me, Mr. Chu?

644
00:29:59,153 --> 00:29:59,713
Yes.

645
00:30:00,272 --> 00:30:01,993
After hearing you describe Mount Baiyue,

646
00:30:02,153 --> 00:30:03,433
I became quite enamored.

647
00:30:03,673 --> 00:30:05,193
Pity our plan fell through last night.

648
00:30:05,713 --> 00:30:07,433
Will you have time tonight

649
00:30:07,592 --> 00:30:08,392
to go there with me?

650
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:09,512
No problem.

651
00:30:12,953 --> 00:30:13,480
Commander.

652
00:30:13,592 --> 00:30:14,512
I'll take my leave now.

653
00:30:45,953 --> 00:30:46,536
Commander.

654
00:30:49,312 --> 00:30:50,312
We found Chai Anxi.

655
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,233
Traces of Chai Anxi

656
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:55,272
were found in Jiyang.

657
00:30:58,233 --> 00:30:58,760
Yingxiang.

658
00:30:59,312 --> 00:30:59,873
Pack up.

659
00:31:00,112 --> 00:31:00,832
Let's depart now.

660
00:31:01,592 --> 00:31:02,873
We'll kill him before Xiao Jue

661
00:31:03,272 --> 00:31:04,112
arrives.

662
00:31:04,433 --> 00:31:04,968
Understood.

663
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,633
Young Master.

664
00:31:09,072 --> 00:31:10,512
Are you writing to Chancellor Xu?

665
00:31:11,032 --> 00:31:11,560
No.

666
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:13,153
This is for Miss He.

667
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:14,713
I need to write her

668
00:31:15,193 --> 00:31:16,112
an apology

669
00:31:16,552 --> 00:31:17,433
for breaking my word.

670
00:31:19,473 --> 00:31:20,592
Shall I send someone

671
00:31:20,673 --> 00:31:21,673
to Mount Baiyue

672
00:31:22,153 --> 00:31:23,072
to deliver it to her

673
00:31:23,832 --> 00:31:24,633
in case she waits?

674
00:31:25,112 --> 00:31:26,433
I'll hand this letter to Xiao Jue

675
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:27,792
when I bid him farewell

676
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:29,112
for delivery.

677
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,993
Are you testing Xiao Jue's reactions?

678
00:31:31,312 --> 00:31:32,072
Xiao Jue

679
00:31:32,112 --> 00:31:33,713
knows Miss He's true identity

680
00:31:33,873 --> 00:31:34,873
but helps conceal it.

681
00:31:35,552 --> 00:31:37,112
Perhaps he harbors feelings for her.

682
00:31:41,913 --> 00:31:43,272
Calling me like that

683
00:31:44,873 --> 00:31:45,633
is bad enough.

684
00:31:45,953 --> 00:31:47,032
Don't lose face in front of

685
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:47,792
others.

686
00:31:48,552 --> 00:31:49,592
I've already tested him.

687
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:51,752
Our abrupt departure

688
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:53,592
will raise Xiao Jue's doubts.

689
00:31:54,393 --> 00:31:55,112
This letter

690
00:31:55,592 --> 00:31:57,032
will keep him occupied.

691
00:31:57,993 --> 00:31:58,552
It may

692
00:31:59,473 --> 00:32:00,913
(To He Yan)
buy us some time.

693
00:32:02,272 --> 00:32:03,393
(To He Yan)
I knew he had

694
00:32:03,433 --> 00:32:04,112
ulterior motives.

695
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:05,713
A decree delivery?

696
00:32:06,032 --> 00:32:07,112
Actually he was probing

697
00:32:07,193 --> 00:32:07,913
for Xu Jingfu.

698
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:09,873
Now, he must've heard something,

699
00:32:10,272 --> 00:32:11,312
going to Jiyang overnight.

700
00:32:13,592 --> 00:32:14,344
This is

701
00:32:14,752 --> 00:32:15,752
within my expectations.

702
00:32:16,272 --> 00:32:17,433
As a military officer,

703
00:32:17,913 --> 00:32:19,112
without imperial orders

704
00:32:19,153 --> 00:32:20,153
or urgent matters,

705
00:32:20,552 --> 00:32:21,512
I can't just leave.

706
00:32:22,512 --> 00:32:23,072
Moreover,

707
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:25,433
our family has some history

708
00:32:25,592 --> 00:32:26,433
with Princess Mengji.

709
00:32:27,752 --> 00:32:29,032
We must act cautiously.

710
00:32:32,233 --> 00:32:32,993
Luckily, Jiyang,

711
00:32:33,592 --> 00:32:34,752
though under Wei's rule,

712
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:37,433
operates autonomously.

713
00:32:37,913 --> 00:32:39,393
With Princess Mengji holding power,

714
00:32:40,272 --> 00:32:40,953
outsiders

715
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:42,633
without connections

716
00:32:43,433 --> 00:32:44,713
find themselves constrained.

717
00:32:45,592 --> 00:32:47,153
He won't locate Chai Anxi quickly.

718
00:32:47,873 --> 00:32:48,393
Feinu,

719
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:50,352
hurry up and arrange

720
00:32:50,993 --> 00:32:51,832
the identity change.

721
00:32:52,993 --> 00:32:53,512
Yes.

722
00:32:57,592 --> 00:32:58,552
- Feinu.
- Mr. Cheng.

723
00:32:59,433 --> 00:32:59,976
Huaijin.

724
00:33:00,233 --> 00:33:01,953
I just saw Chu Zhao leave.

725
00:33:02,352 --> 00:33:02,953
He's supposed

726
00:33:02,993 --> 00:33:04,272
to meet Miss He today, isn't he?

727
00:33:04,832 --> 00:33:05,433
He definitely

728
00:33:05,473 --> 00:33:07,233
hasn't made it to the meeting yet.

729
00:33:07,233 --> 00:33:07,832
Huaijin.

730
00:33:08,072 --> 00:33:09,312
This is a good opportunity.

731
00:33:09,913 --> 00:33:10,920
If Miss He

732
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,104
truly has feelings for him,

733
00:33:12,393 --> 00:33:13,633
and now he broke their plan...

734
00:33:14,272 --> 00:33:15,112
Miss He

735
00:33:15,272 --> 00:33:16,512
is still a girl after all.

736
00:33:16,792 --> 00:33:18,112
She is delicate and sensitive.

737
00:33:18,393 --> 00:33:18,913
Now,

738
00:33:19,032 --> 00:33:20,193
she needs companionship.

739
00:33:20,752 --> 00:33:22,393
If you offer her gentle consolation,

740
00:33:22,832 --> 00:33:24,393
you'll surely win her favor.

741
00:33:26,072 --> 00:33:27,312
She wants to see Chu Zhao.
