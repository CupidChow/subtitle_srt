Offer incense.

25
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,374
Present jade and silk.

00:02:41,414 --> 00:02:42,933
Kneel.

00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:52,733
Bow.

28
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:55,574
Rise.

Rise.

Bow thrice.

32
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:12,213
Rise.

33
00:03:13,814 --> 00:03:15,254
Get up.

34
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:19,773
The winter sacrificial ceremony
is concluded.

35
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:21,694
Officials,

36
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:24,733
please proceed to Longtai Hall.

37
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:34,974
Yan He.

38
00:03:35,574 --> 00:03:36,453
When did you arrive?

39
00:03:37,254 --> 00:03:39,053
I always thought
you were short and thin,

40
00:03:39,254 --> 00:03:40,694
but never expected you were a woman.

41
00:03:42,094 --> 00:03:42,854
Well...

42
00:03:43,254 --> 00:03:44,694
Do you look down on me

43
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:46,653
and disdain being friends with me

44
00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:48,493
because I'm a woman now?

45
00:03:49,134 --> 00:03:50,213
Do you think

46
00:03:50,254 --> 00:03:51,574
I am that kind of base person?

47
00:03:52,134 --> 00:03:52,893
I'm angry because

48
00:03:52,974 --> 00:03:54,333
you and Xiao Jue hid this from me.

49
00:03:55,213 --> 00:03:57,014
We had to.

50
00:03:57,134 --> 00:03:58,254
I didn't want to either.

51
00:03:59,134 --> 00:03:59,613
By the way,

52
00:04:00,294 --> 00:04:01,893
how is your wife recently?

53
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:03,294
She's quite well.

54
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:04,733
The baby

55
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:05,933
has behaved.

56
00:04:10,294 --> 00:04:12,053
But the Huayuan battle
turned out like this,

57
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,294
how dare He Rufei show his face here?

58
00:04:23,134 --> 00:04:23,934
Excellent.

59
00:04:24,174 --> 00:04:25,293
Everyone is here.

60
00:04:26,254 --> 00:04:26,814
Let's go.

61
00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:37,054
Greetings, Your Majesty.

62
00:04:39,134 --> 00:04:40,333
Rise, everyone.

63
00:04:58,494 --> 00:04:59,773
I am Maningbu,

64
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:01,973
greetings to Emperor Wei.

65
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:04,174
You have traveled far,

66
00:05:04,254 --> 00:05:05,054
must be weary.

67
00:05:05,893 --> 00:05:07,893
As a foreign envoy,

68
00:05:08,093 --> 00:05:09,533
I've heard of

69
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:10,734
your ear for talent

70
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:11,934
and prudent governance.

71
00:05:12,134 --> 00:05:13,614
What a model ruler of our age.

72
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,054
I deeply respect you.

73
00:05:16,814 --> 00:05:17,694
Today,

74
00:05:17,853 --> 00:05:18,973
I want to offer you a toast.

75
00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:25,213
Your words

76
00:05:25,453 --> 00:05:27,054
are really flattering me.

77
00:05:35,973 --> 00:05:37,814
Your generous hospitality

78
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:40,374
really moves me.

79
00:05:40,694 --> 00:05:42,934
Wei and Wutuo are neighbors,

80
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,653
so we should share brotherly bonds

81
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:47,254
as we do now in harmony.

82
00:05:47,574 --> 00:05:48,453
With this opportunity,

83
00:05:48,814 --> 00:05:50,533
Wutuo wishes to ally with Wei,

84
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:52,734
bonding our relationship,

85
00:05:52,934 --> 00:05:54,374
and ending all conflicts.

86
00:05:54,893 --> 00:05:57,093
If we can truly cease the war,

87
00:05:57,134 --> 00:05:58,374
nothing could be better.

88
00:05:58,574 --> 00:06:00,853
After our alliance is sealed

89
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,893
and establish trade markets,

90
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:04,853
I'm sure we can

91
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:07,174
get peace and benefits.

92
00:06:14,893 --> 00:06:16,494
Regarding the trade markets,

93
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:21,333
details to be confirmed.

94
00:06:22,093 --> 00:06:23,653
Please be more patient.

95
00:06:29,574 --> 00:06:30,614
It seems Wei

96
00:06:31,134 --> 00:06:32,694
lacks sincerity in facilitating

97
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:34,014
the alliance.

98
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:41,533
What?

99
00:06:42,254 --> 00:06:44,213
We must let Wutuo gain all advantages

100
00:06:44,453 --> 00:06:45,853
to prove our sincerity?

101
00:06:55,734 --> 00:06:56,653
Marquis Wu'an.

102
00:06:56,893 --> 00:06:57,614
You are

103
00:06:57,694 --> 00:06:59,254
being too arrogant.

104
00:07:00,093 --> 00:07:02,333
Whether the trade markets open

105
00:07:02,934 --> 00:07:04,054
is not

106
00:07:04,653 --> 00:07:05,934
for you to decide.

107
00:07:08,213 --> 00:07:11,293
You fought Wutuo several times,

108
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:12,934
yet now you speak

109
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:14,093
for Wutuo.

110
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:15,653
Have their blows made you

111
00:07:15,934 --> 00:07:17,413
a turncoat now?

112
00:07:29,374 --> 00:07:29,973
Your Majesty,

113
00:07:30,494 --> 00:07:31,973
when I led the Fuyue Army

114
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:33,014
to quell rebellions,

115
00:07:33,093 --> 00:07:33,533
my goal

116
00:07:33,694 --> 00:07:35,574
was the Wei's prosperity and peace.

117
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:36,973
My lifelong wish

118
00:07:37,054 --> 00:07:38,054
is to safeguard

119
00:07:38,093 --> 00:07:39,614
the Wei's land for you.

120
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:40,574
Apart from that,

121
00:07:40,614 --> 00:07:41,494
there's nothing more.

122
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,093
Your Majesty, please trust

123
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,734
my loyalty.

124
00:07:51,853 --> 00:07:53,773
General Feihong is a loyal,

125
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:55,054
peerless warrior unmatched

126
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,333
by a thousand.

127
00:07:56,814 --> 00:07:57,614
He would never

128
00:07:57,653 --> 00:07:58,773
commit acts of treason.

129
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:00,853
But the question remains:

130
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,893
Are you General Feihong?

131
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:16,574
Nonsense.

132
00:08:26,694 --> 00:08:27,413
Your Majesty,

133
00:08:27,413 --> 00:08:27,893
I have

134
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:30,293
to accuse He Rufei
of three major crimes.

135
00:08:43,614 --> 00:08:44,734
Three major crimes?

136
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:46,334
What do you mean?

137
00:08:52,374 --> 00:08:53,334
First crime:

138
00:08:54,014 --> 00:08:55,134
Substitution fraud

139
00:08:55,573 --> 00:08:57,214
by stealing General Feihong's identity.

140
00:08:57,813 --> 00:08:58,933
- What?
- What?

141
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:00,614
Is this true?

142
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,173
Please summon a witness.

143
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:05,094
This person can verify

144
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:06,413
the truth of my claim.

145
00:09:07,494 --> 00:09:07,933
Summon!

146
00:09:08,573 --> 00:09:10,413
By the imperial decree,

147
00:09:10,854 --> 00:09:11,974
summon him!

148
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:29,214
Commander of Rundu Li Kuang.

149
00:09:29,614 --> 00:09:30,653
Greetings, Your Majesty.

150
00:09:31,214 --> 00:09:32,734
So you're the Commander of Rundu

151
00:09:32,734 --> 00:09:33,374
Li Kuang.

152
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:34,573
In the Rundu battle,

153
00:09:34,734 --> 00:09:36,014
you deserve recognition.

154
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:37,014
Please rise.

155
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:38,374
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

156
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:47,293
(Commander,)

157
00:09:48,293 --> 00:09:49,053
it's been days.

158
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:51,014
You are...

159
00:09:52,653 --> 00:09:53,293
He Yan?

160
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:54,693
I'm He Yan

161
00:09:54,974 --> 00:09:55,693
who fought

162
00:09:55,734 --> 00:09:57,214
with you at Rundu.

163
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:01,053
I am Li Kuang.

164
00:10:01,693 --> 00:10:02,854
Greetings, General Feihong.

165
00:10:16,454 --> 00:10:17,134
Commander Li.

166
00:10:17,413 --> 00:10:18,134
You'd read

167
00:10:18,374 --> 00:10:19,773
this letter after we leave.

168
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:27,214
Jujube and turtle...

169
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:28,413
Come back soon.

170
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,494
We Eight Warriors

171
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:31,693
were born into poverty.

172
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:34,014
Most were illiterate,

173
00:10:35,813 --> 00:10:36,693
so we devised

174
00:10:37,173 --> 00:10:37,974
such a crude method

175
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:38,933
for communication.

176
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:40,533
These codes are

177
00:10:40,693 --> 00:10:41,653
known only to us eight

178
00:10:41,854 --> 00:10:43,173
and General Feihong.

179
00:10:44,693 --> 00:10:46,053
Now seven were gone,

180
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:47,734
leaving only

181
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:48,734
me and

182
00:10:50,173 --> 00:10:51,893
General Feihong.

183
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:56,614
Rise.

184
00:10:57,413 --> 00:10:58,254
I

185
00:10:59,094 --> 00:11:00,014
am late.

186
00:11:01,653 --> 00:11:03,053
Sorry, General.

187
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:05,053
Rise.

188
00:11:11,334 --> 00:11:12,374
You're not late,

189
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:14,413
but arrive in time.

190
00:11:22,293 --> 00:11:23,053
I

191
00:11:24,014 --> 00:11:24,974
dare not claim merit.

192
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:27,134
If not for General Fengyun

193
00:11:27,214 --> 00:11:28,854
and General Feihong's

194
00:11:28,893 --> 00:11:29,773
timely aid,

195
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:31,214
Rundu's people

196
00:11:31,974 --> 00:11:33,454
would've been killed

197
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:35,134
by Wutuo.

198
00:11:39,254 --> 00:11:41,053
Li, explain yourself.

199
00:11:41,893 --> 00:11:43,053
The ones who saved Rundu

200
00:11:43,094 --> 00:11:44,053
were General Fengyun

201
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:45,094
and Marquis Wu'an.

202
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:47,254
Why mentioned General Feihong?

203
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,653
Because

204
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:52,094
Marquis Wu'an

205
00:11:53,134 --> 00:11:55,254
is the genuine General Feihong!

206
00:12:07,734 --> 00:12:08,494
General He,

207
00:12:09,254 --> 00:12:10,653
what do you have to say?

208
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:18,734
Your Majesty,

209
00:12:19,094 --> 00:12:20,854
this man conspires with He Yan

210
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:21,974
in a vile scheme

211
00:12:22,134 --> 00:12:23,494
to frame me!

212
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,334
That's strange.

213
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:27,533
Li Kuang served as your deputy,

214
00:12:27,773 --> 00:12:29,254
sharing life-and-death struggles

215
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:30,374
and fighting with you.

216
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:32,533
Why would he frame you now?

217
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:39,893
Perhaps in the Rundu Battle,

218
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,933
my late reinforcements

219
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,413
angered him,

220
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:48,053
making him He Yan's pawn.

221
00:12:51,454 --> 00:12:52,094
He Rufei.

222
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:53,773
Why didn't you save

223
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:54,653
your former deputy?

224
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:08,734
His statements
are full of inconsistencies.

225
00:13:08,773 --> 00:13:10,454
He's deliberately slandering me.

226
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:12,374
I'm innocent!

227
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:14,014
Please judge fairly.

228
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,214
It seems you deny

229
00:13:18,254 --> 00:13:19,653
the first crime charge.

230
00:13:22,813 --> 00:13:23,494
Marquis Wu'an.

231
00:13:23,893 --> 00:13:24,734
Second one.

232
00:13:28,653 --> 00:13:29,454
Second crime:

233
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:31,653
To conceal his false identity,

234
00:13:32,293 --> 00:13:33,293
he eliminated

235
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:34,773
his comrades!

236
00:13:35,494 --> 00:13:36,214
I have evidence

237
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:37,813
to present.

238
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:41,614
Get it to me.

239
00:13:41,813 --> 00:13:42,374
Yes.

240
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:54,077
(To Xiao Jue)

241
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:05,886
(Assassination, in Chonghuai)

242
00:14:09,374 --> 00:14:11,134
The assassins outside Chonghuai.

243
00:14:11,813 --> 00:14:12,653
General He,

244
00:14:13,214 --> 00:14:14,533
have you forgotten them?

245
00:14:15,693 --> 00:14:16,254
My lord,

246
00:14:16,974 --> 00:14:17,773
we discovered

247
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,734
tattooed markings on

248
00:14:18,854 --> 00:14:19,653
one assassin's body.

249
00:14:20,053 --> 00:14:21,254
He might be a former prisoner.

250
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:25,494
By tracing these markings,

251
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:26,813
we can determine

252
00:14:26,813 --> 00:14:28,134
when and where he was imprisoned,

253
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:29,173
thus,

254
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,293
we can know his real name

255
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:34,773
and background.

256
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:37,693
Yang Mingzhi has replied.

257
00:14:38,693 --> 00:14:40,134
He found the assassins' origins.

258
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:42,254
They're linked to He Rufei.

259
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:43,533
So,

260
00:14:44,014 --> 00:14:45,573
that tattooed assassin was

261
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,134
a distant relative
of He Mansion's steward.

262
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:50,813
They did everything

263
00:14:51,494 --> 00:14:53,374
to eliminate me.

264
00:14:54,413 --> 00:14:55,053
You thought

265
00:14:55,813 --> 00:14:57,014
that dead men

266
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:58,854
could tell nothing.

267
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,134
But traces can't be erased.

268
00:15:01,813 --> 00:15:03,293
Dead men still tell us something.

269
00:15:08,214 --> 00:15:09,374
I don't know

270
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:10,813
what you're talking about.

271
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:15,214
Your steward

272
00:15:15,254 --> 00:15:16,734
acted so recklessly,

273
00:15:17,494 --> 00:15:19,173
yet you know nothing?

274
00:15:21,334 --> 00:15:22,573
I failed to supervise him.

275
00:15:22,734 --> 00:15:24,214
Your Majesty, forgive me.

276
00:15:26,454 --> 00:15:28,494
Besides repeated attempts to kill me,

277
00:15:28,974 --> 00:15:29,974
in the Huayuan Battle,

278
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,693
the Fuyue Army's Seven Tiger Generals

279
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:34,974
were ambushed and killed together.

280
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:36,933
It's another scheme

281
00:15:37,454 --> 00:15:38,693
by He Rufei!

282
00:15:39,693 --> 00:15:41,454
Things change in the battlefields.

283
00:15:41,813 --> 00:15:42,974
We have

284
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:45,293
to be flexible.

285
00:15:47,374 --> 00:15:48,053
He Rufei.

286
00:15:48,893 --> 00:15:50,214
I don't care who you are.

287
00:15:50,813 --> 00:15:51,494
But you fought in

288
00:15:51,494 --> 00:15:52,334
the Huayuan Battle.

289
00:15:53,254 --> 00:15:54,134
Just tell me,

290
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,254
did you truly abandon

291
00:15:56,494 --> 00:15:57,573
thousands of soldiers

292
00:15:57,653 --> 00:15:58,773
for personal gain?

293
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:06,933
Punish He Rufei severely, Your Majesty!

294
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:08,734
Avenge the unjustly slain

295
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:11,014
from the Huayuan Battle!

296
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:18,533
Punish He Rufei severely, Your Majesty!

297
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:20,454
Avenge the unjustly slain

298
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:23,134
from the Huayuan Battle!

299
00:16:31,053 --> 00:16:32,053
Third crime:

300
00:16:33,014 --> 00:16:34,374
Colluding with Wutuo,

301
00:16:35,173 --> 00:16:36,573
and treason against Wei!

302
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:52,533
False accusations!

303
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:54,053
He Yan.

304
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,773
You have no evidence

305
00:16:56,813 --> 00:16:58,293
at all.

306
00:17:07,214 --> 00:17:08,254
I do!

307
00:17:25,373 --> 00:17:27,014
- It's her!
- Indeed.

308
00:17:31,654 --> 00:17:32,934
(Why is she here?)

309
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:51,853
Your Majesty,

310
00:17:52,414 --> 00:17:53,293
these letters

311
00:17:53,694 --> 00:17:55,613
are secretly hidden by He Rufei.

312
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:57,333
And I stole them.

313
00:18:01,174 --> 00:18:02,174
They contain

314
00:18:03,214 --> 00:18:04,414
evidence

315
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:06,974
of He Rufei's treason.

316
00:18:12,093 --> 00:18:12,694
Get them to me.

317
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:19,613
A Madam He seeks audience

318
00:18:19,813 --> 00:18:20,613
outside the hall.

319
00:18:20,894 --> 00:18:21,694
Madam He?

320
00:18:22,174 --> 00:18:22,734
Who's that?

321
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:26,573
Bring her in.

322
00:18:27,214 --> 00:18:27,734
Yes.

323
00:18:36,734 --> 00:18:37,894
I heard the Tianxing Platform

324
00:18:37,934 --> 00:18:39,254
is about to hold a night banquet.

325
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:42,014
These letters

326
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:42,894
should prove helpful.

327
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:44,853
Thank you.

328
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:46,654
General Fengyun.

329
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,694
I have a favor to ask.

330
00:18:50,053 --> 00:18:51,573
Please help me enter the palace,

331
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:53,894
so I can present these letters myself.

332
00:18:54,613 --> 00:18:55,254
No way.

333
00:18:56,293 --> 00:18:57,214
It'd be dangerous.

334
00:18:58,093 --> 00:18:58,734
Madam He.

335
00:18:59,174 --> 00:19:00,333
Don't get involved in it.

336
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:09,533
Madam He, you don't need to.

337
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:10,694
General.

338
00:19:11,293 --> 00:19:12,894
I'm doing this for Yan.

339
00:19:13,373 --> 00:19:14,974
I know Rufei resents her.

340
00:19:15,494 --> 00:19:16,894
I watched them

341
00:19:16,934 --> 00:19:18,014
harmed her once,

342
00:19:18,093 --> 00:19:19,414
and I must stop them now.

343
00:19:20,974 --> 00:19:22,373
Please help me, General.

344
00:19:24,254 --> 00:19:24,813
Alright.

345
00:19:25,454 --> 00:19:26,414
I'll help you.

346
00:19:27,694 --> 00:19:28,694
Regarding the evidence,

347
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:31,533
please inform Yan

348
00:19:31,694 --> 00:19:32,533
to reassure her.

349
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:35,934
But don't tell her that I'd present

350
00:19:37,454 --> 00:19:38,894
the evidence myself.

351
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:49,333
Your Majesty.

352
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:50,974
I can testify

353
00:19:52,214 --> 00:19:53,613
that my stepson He Rufei

354
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,613
is not General Feihong at all.

355
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:59,014
I'm the descendant of a scholar,

356
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:00,934
living at home with my young daughter.

357
00:20:01,254 --> 00:20:03,454
He Yuansheng coveted
my family's reputation.

358
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:05,014
Since my family had declined,

359
00:20:05,053 --> 00:20:06,373
he forced me into the He Mansion.

360
00:20:07,254 --> 00:20:08,533
Unexpectedly, soon after,

361
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:10,694
He Rufei fell gravely ill.

362
00:20:11,373 --> 00:20:13,613
Physicians predicted he'd die early.

363
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:15,373
He Yuansheng feared losing his title,

364
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:17,333
yet couldn't bear to abandon his son.

365
00:20:17,654 --> 00:20:19,133
He thought adopting a boy

366
00:20:19,773 --> 00:20:21,174
might let him breed evil ambition,

367
00:20:21,293 --> 00:20:22,254
and be hard to control.

368
00:20:23,293 --> 00:20:25,174
So he made my daughter
disguised as a man

369
00:20:25,573 --> 00:20:27,414
and swap identities with He Rufei.

370
00:20:27,734 --> 00:20:29,053
My daughter has been clever

371
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:30,056
and favors martial arts.

372
00:20:30,373 --> 00:20:31,533
She joined the army early

373
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:33,053
and risked her life in battlefields,

374
00:20:33,694 --> 00:20:35,654
earning the title General Feihong.

375
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:36,773
When she returned,

376
00:20:36,934 --> 00:20:38,613
Rufei had recovered fully.

377
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:41,894
When Your Majesty awarded,

378
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:43,773
He Rufei was so greedy,

379
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,654
and He Yuansheng feared

380
00:20:45,654 --> 00:20:47,053
He Yan would expose them,

381
00:20:47,053 --> 00:20:47,533
so...

382
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:49,533
they...

383
00:20:50,934 --> 00:20:52,573
So they poisoned

384
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,053
and blinded her.

385
00:20:55,613 --> 00:20:56,133
Later,

386
00:20:56,853 --> 00:20:58,373
they silenced her.

387
00:20:58,974 --> 00:21:00,053
Your Majesty.

388
00:21:00,254 --> 00:21:01,293
My daughter He Yan

389
00:21:01,813 --> 00:21:03,894
is the genuine General Feihong!

390
00:21:04,293 --> 00:21:05,293
- This...
- What!

391
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:21,454
What's wrong?

392
00:21:22,373 --> 00:21:23,654
Don't trust her!

393
00:21:23,853 --> 00:21:24,573
Your Majesty.

394
00:21:24,573 --> 00:21:25,934
This woman is too sick

395
00:21:25,934 --> 00:21:27,293
to think clearly.

396
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:28,254
What she said

397
00:21:28,293 --> 00:21:29,373
is completely nonsense.

398
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,214
I...

399
00:21:30,773 --> 00:21:32,014
I was telling all the truth.

400
00:21:32,373 --> 00:21:33,613
Your Majesty, please trust me.

401
00:21:35,014 --> 00:21:36,214
I told no lies.

402
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,214
If I did,

403
00:21:38,414 --> 00:21:39,654
may lightning strike me,

404
00:21:40,093 --> 00:21:41,533
and I'd die horribly,

405
00:21:42,053 --> 00:21:44,133
descend to the netherworld,

406
00:21:44,174 --> 00:21:45,694
and never to escape.

407
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:47,373
Your Majesty, please trust me.

408
00:21:48,414 --> 00:21:50,254
Hold justice for my daughter.

409
00:21:51,734 --> 00:21:52,974
Your Majesty,

410
00:21:53,053 --> 00:21:54,055
please summon physicians!

411
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:55,093
Go summon them!

412
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:55,813
Yes.

413
00:21:56,293 --> 00:21:57,373
Imperial physician!

414
00:21:57,414 --> 00:21:58,613
Your Majesty, please trust me.

415
00:21:59,813 --> 00:22:03,214
I was telling all the truth.

416
00:22:04,174 --> 00:22:05,894
I'll stake my life

417
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:08,894
to prove it.

418
00:22:10,813 --> 00:22:11,694
Why?

419
00:22:11,934 --> 00:22:13,494
As a mother,

420
00:22:13,494 --> 00:22:15,494
I tried to protect everything.

421
00:22:15,894 --> 00:22:17,174
Yet in the end,

422
00:22:18,454 --> 00:22:20,174
I failed to protect anything.

423
00:22:20,813 --> 00:22:21,853
A shameless person

424
00:22:23,573 --> 00:22:25,454
like me

425
00:22:25,734 --> 00:22:27,454
doesn't deserve to live longer.

426
00:22:31,853 --> 00:22:32,533
Rufei,

427
00:22:48,613 --> 00:22:49,773
repent your sins.

428
00:22:50,813 --> 00:22:51,533
Rufei.

429
00:22:51,773 --> 00:22:52,494
Rufei.

430
00:22:53,053 --> 00:22:54,293
Repent your sins.

431
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:14,414
Ingrate!

432
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,174
Madam.

433
00:23:17,734 --> 00:23:18,894
You're sick.

434
00:23:20,014 --> 00:23:22,174
Really sick!

435
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:34,454
Your Majesty,

436
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:35,734
the poison has spread,

437
00:23:36,093 --> 00:23:37,293
and she is beyond cure.

438
00:23:47,014 --> 00:23:48,014
Don't cry.

439
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,613
I'm not worth your tears.

440
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:54,694
Mother.

441
00:23:57,613 --> 00:23:58,093
I...

442
00:23:58,894 --> 00:24:00,494
I finally heard

443
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:03,254
you call me Mother.

444
00:24:04,934 --> 00:24:05,974
Wonderful.

445
00:24:11,014 --> 00:24:15,414
Cloaked in lotus splendor,

446
00:24:16,813 --> 00:24:19,773
yet adrift without anchor.

447
00:24:21,014 --> 00:24:21,853
Yan.

448
00:24:24,494 --> 00:24:25,254
Live...

449
00:24:37,694 --> 00:24:38,734
Live

450
00:24:39,734 --> 00:24:40,853
well.

451
00:24:58,694 --> 00:24:59,613
Mother!

452
00:25:04,813 --> 00:25:05,853
Monster!

453
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:11,454
Mother.

454
00:25:16,293 --> 00:25:17,974
Take Madam He away first.

455
00:25:18,494 --> 00:25:20,133
Let her rest in peace.

456
00:25:39,974 --> 00:25:40,734
Mother.

457
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:42,773
He Yan.

458
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,613
He Rufei.

459
00:26:08,494 --> 00:26:10,093
Though we're nominally siblings,

460
00:26:10,974 --> 00:26:12,853
we're destined to fight.

461
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:21,934
He Rufei!

462
00:26:23,654 --> 00:26:25,174
You deceived me,

463
00:26:25,934 --> 00:26:27,573
falsely claimed official titles,

464
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:31,254
attempted to silence witnesses,

465
00:26:31,934 --> 00:26:33,373
slaughtered your comrades,

466
00:26:33,494 --> 00:26:34,613
and betrayed the Wei!

467
00:26:35,174 --> 00:26:36,373
How heinous!

468
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:37,454
Unforgivable!

469
00:26:38,494 --> 00:26:39,974
Now we have witnesses and evidence!

470
00:26:40,254 --> 00:26:41,613
How dare you still deny it?

471
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:53,654
This matter isn't concluded yet.

472
00:26:54,773 --> 00:26:57,813
Your Majesty shouldn't
convict General He

473
00:26:58,133 --> 00:26:59,573
hastily.

474
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,293
Marquis Wu'an.

475
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:05,174
How dare you draw sword
before the Emperor?

476
00:27:05,533 --> 00:27:07,373
This is great disrespect!

477
00:27:08,254 --> 00:27:08,894
What?

478
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,254
Chancellor Xu, did you forget

479
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:18,533
that those letters

480
00:27:18,934 --> 00:27:20,133
also implicate you?

481
00:27:30,014 --> 00:27:31,934
Your Majesty.

482
00:27:33,014 --> 00:27:34,613
He Rufei committed countless crimes,

483
00:27:34,974 --> 00:27:35,533
but he's been

484
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:37,053
manipulated by Xu Jingfu.

485
00:27:37,773 --> 00:27:39,174
Xu Jingfu is the true

486
00:27:39,214 --> 00:27:40,133
mastermind

487
00:27:40,654 --> 00:27:42,014
who's making trouble

488
00:27:42,573 --> 00:27:44,613
and betraying the Wei!

489
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:50,174
- Nonsense!
- Nonsense!

490
00:27:50,734 --> 00:27:51,494
Exactly.

491
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:52,974
Back in Mingshui,

492
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,694
you killed 30,000 Xiao Army soldiers

493
00:27:56,454 --> 00:27:58,214
to eliminate political rivals.

494
00:27:58,974 --> 00:27:59,694
Back in Yezhou,

495
00:28:00,654 --> 00:28:01,494
you used someone

496
00:28:01,494 --> 00:28:02,934
to kill Sun Xiangfu

497
00:28:03,293 --> 00:28:04,813
to hide your embezzlement.

498
00:28:05,254 --> 00:28:05,894
Back in Jiyang,

499
00:28:06,254 --> 00:28:07,894
you colluded with Wutuo,

500
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:09,613
leading us to nearly lose Jiyang.

501
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:12,573
In Huayuan and Rundu,

502
00:28:13,853 --> 00:28:15,373
you let He Rufei slaughter

503
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:16,934
the seven generals,

504
00:28:17,214 --> 00:28:18,573
causing Rundu's siege.

505
00:28:18,894 --> 00:28:20,655
And you secretly
negotiated peace with Wutuo.

506
00:28:21,254 --> 00:28:22,533
Everything you've done

507
00:28:23,174 --> 00:28:25,174
serves only your personal gain.

508
00:28:30,573 --> 00:28:32,053
He corrupts the court,

509
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:33,613
threatens the peace,

510
00:28:34,053 --> 00:28:35,293
and damages the people!

511
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:38,694
His guilt is heinous!

512
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,014
He Yan.

513
00:28:47,214 --> 00:28:48,813
You said Chancellor Xu was behind this.

514
00:28:48,974 --> 00:28:49,773
Where's your proof?

515
00:29:04,254 --> 00:29:05,654
He Yan speaks the truth.

516
00:29:06,293 --> 00:29:07,333
I am the witness!

517
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:22,014
I have

518
00:29:22,373 --> 00:29:23,974
long been Chancellor Xu's disciple,

519
00:29:24,293 --> 00:29:26,093
and always respected him.

520
00:29:26,494 --> 00:29:27,293
But over time,

521
00:29:27,773 --> 00:29:29,293
I realized he

522
00:29:31,254 --> 00:29:32,333
wasn't a virtuous minister

523
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:33,333
I believed.

524
00:29:39,974 --> 00:29:41,694
But he has shown me great kindness.

525
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:43,734
I struggled for a long time,

526
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,694
yet I couldn't watch him
keep making mistakes.

527
00:29:47,894 --> 00:29:48,694
So yesterday,

528
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:50,694
I caught the Wutuo spy

529
00:29:50,734 --> 00:29:52,613
who's disguised
as Ganming Pavilion's owner.

530
00:29:53,414 --> 00:29:54,694
After the interrogation,

531
00:29:55,454 --> 00:29:56,254
he gave me

532
00:29:56,813 --> 00:29:57,533
a letter

533
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,494
from Chancellor Xu

534
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:00,853
to Wutuo envoy, Maningbu.

535
00:30:07,894 --> 00:30:08,934
He promises Maningbu

536
00:30:09,654 --> 00:30:11,934
to promote
the trade market establishment.

537
00:30:17,214 --> 00:30:17,773
Get it to me.

538
00:30:18,093 --> 00:30:18,654
Yes.

539
00:30:31,848 --> 00:30:33,910
(To Maningbu)

540
00:30:40,649 --> 00:30:47,738
(Trade Market Cooperation, Xu Jingfu)

541
00:31:03,454 --> 00:31:04,093
Now,

542
00:31:04,734 --> 00:31:05,853
I've taken that Wutuo spy

543
00:31:06,093 --> 00:31:07,333
outside the hall.

544
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,573
He can confront against

545
00:31:11,934 --> 00:31:12,773
Envoy Maningbu.

546
00:31:14,613 --> 00:31:15,133
Bring him.

547
00:31:15,293 --> 00:31:16,573
No need.

548
00:31:18,373 --> 00:31:19,773
You dare defy the imperial decree?

549
00:31:25,254 --> 00:31:27,853
You have aged.

550
00:31:28,414 --> 00:31:29,053
- He...
- What...

551
00:31:29,214 --> 00:31:30,174
What does he want?

552
00:31:30,734 --> 00:31:32,414
You're deceived by traitors,

553
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:36,014
believing slanders,

554
00:31:36,573 --> 00:31:37,813
wronging loyal ministers!

555
00:31:40,573 --> 00:31:44,573
This grieves me deeply.

556
00:31:47,894 --> 00:31:48,533
As

557
00:31:50,254 --> 00:31:52,573
the Chancellor of Wei,

558
00:31:52,734 --> 00:31:54,414
I bear the duty to purge the villains

559
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,894
and eliminate treacherous officials!

560
00:31:58,853 --> 00:31:59,494
Guards!

561
00:32:00,214 --> 00:32:01,974
Fuyue Army, heed my command!

562
00:32:02,093 --> 00:32:03,053
Purge the villains!

563
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,494
- He's committing treason!
- He's committing treason!

564
00:32:31,093 --> 00:32:32,053
Xu Jingfu!

565
00:32:32,654 --> 00:32:34,214
How dare you commit treason!

566
00:32:44,014 --> 00:32:44,813
Your Majesty,

567
00:32:45,373 --> 00:32:46,454
I've done

568
00:32:46,894 --> 00:32:49,133
all those things.

569
00:32:49,654 --> 00:32:51,813
You trust villains and alienated

570
00:32:51,853 --> 00:32:53,254
worthy ministers like me,

571
00:32:53,494 --> 00:32:55,654
failing to be a wise emperor.

572
00:32:56,293 --> 00:32:59,734
Naturally, I must step forward

573
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:02,174
to uphold justice!

574
00:33:04,454 --> 00:33:05,813
You treacherous rebel!

575
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:09,174
How dare you say such words

576
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,454
and plot to usurp the throne!

577
00:33:13,214 --> 00:33:14,014
Your Majesty,

578
00:33:14,373 --> 00:33:16,533
don't get me wrong.

579
00:33:17,773 --> 00:33:20,773
I've been loyal to the nation.

580
00:33:20,894 --> 00:33:21,813
Once you

581
00:33:22,214 --> 00:33:23,934
issue a penitential edict

582
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:25,254
and abdicates,

583
00:33:25,454 --> 00:33:26,133
I shall

584
00:33:26,454 --> 00:33:29,053
enthrone the young prince,

585
00:33:29,494 --> 00:33:31,214
purge the court,

586
00:33:31,494 --> 00:33:33,093
and restore the governance!

587
00:33:40,533 --> 00:33:42,853
Fuyue Army, heed my command!

588
00:33:43,613 --> 00:33:44,974
Purge the villains!

589
00:33:53,494 --> 00:33:55,533
Fuyue Army, heed my command!

590
00:33:56,214 --> 00:33:57,454
Purge the villains!

591
00:34:06,053 --> 00:34:07,894
Fuyue Army, heed my command!

592
00:34:08,494 --> 00:34:09,733
Purge the villains!

593
00:34:18,294 --> 00:34:18,733
You...

594
00:34:18,774 --> 00:34:19,374
His Majesty has

595
00:34:19,374 --> 00:34:21,133
asked the Nine Banners Battalion
to stand by

596
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:22,454
to subdue the rebels!

597
00:34:22,934 --> 00:34:24,533
Nine Banners Battalion, heed my command!

598
00:34:25,053 --> 00:34:26,053
Capture the traitors!

599
00:34:26,334 --> 00:34:26,934
Yes!

600
00:34:27,014 --> 00:34:27,573
Yes!

601
00:34:38,894 --> 00:34:40,294
Nine Banners Battalion?

602
00:34:40,733 --> 00:34:41,934
Why are they here?

603
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:43,173
Useless!

604
00:34:47,374 --> 00:34:48,173
The rebels

605
00:34:48,894 --> 00:34:50,613
have been suppressed.

606
00:34:54,974 --> 00:34:55,774
He Rufei.

607
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:57,573
Most Fuyue Army soldiers

608
00:34:58,334 --> 00:34:59,294
fought alongside me

609
00:34:59,294 --> 00:35:00,814
through life and death.

610
00:35:01,573 --> 00:35:02,374
He Rufei.

611
00:35:03,533 --> 00:35:04,414
How could they

612
00:35:04,494 --> 00:35:06,213
obey an impostor like you?

613
00:35:20,814 --> 00:35:22,733
Great!

614
00:35:23,774 --> 00:35:25,133
So Your Majesty

615
00:35:25,533 --> 00:35:28,494
collaborated with Commander Xiao

616
00:35:28,573 --> 00:35:30,053
in this deception!

617
00:35:33,774 --> 00:35:35,494
Well played!

618
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:37,814
You have schemed thoroughly,

619
00:35:38,093 --> 00:35:40,294
but overlooked your own arrogance.

620
00:35:47,173 --> 00:35:47,733
Master,

621
00:35:48,374 --> 00:35:49,733
you often taught me

622
00:35:50,294 --> 00:35:51,374
to serve the emperor

623
00:35:52,374 --> 00:35:53,294
and help the people.

624
00:35:54,213 --> 00:35:55,693
Yet what you've done

625
00:35:56,334 --> 00:35:57,374
threatens

626
00:35:57,414 --> 00:35:58,613
the nation

627
00:35:58,613 --> 00:35:59,974
and damages the people.

628
00:36:06,093 --> 00:36:07,334
I beg you,

629
00:36:09,374 --> 00:36:11,093
please stop.

630
00:36:16,653 --> 00:36:17,533
Zilan,

631
00:36:18,294 --> 00:36:20,454
I've treated you well.

632
00:36:21,014 --> 00:36:22,733
How dare you join forces with them

633
00:36:22,733 --> 00:36:24,253
to conspire against me!

634
00:36:24,693 --> 00:36:25,733
What benefits

635
00:36:25,733 --> 00:36:28,133
did they promise you

636
00:36:28,774 --> 00:36:29,974
to make you

637
00:36:30,253 --> 00:36:31,454
act so ungratefully

638
00:36:31,533 --> 00:36:32,894
regardless my kindness to you?

639
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,374
You ingrate!

640
00:36:46,294 --> 00:36:47,733
You preach benevolence,

641
00:36:49,014 --> 00:36:49,774
but in my view,

642
00:36:50,533 --> 00:36:52,494
you're just exploiting favors for gain.

643
00:36:54,133 --> 00:36:55,894
National interests
outweigh personal favors.

644
00:36:56,894 --> 00:36:58,173
As the Chancellor,

645
00:36:58,533 --> 00:36:59,573
don't you know

646
00:36:59,613 --> 00:37:00,494
such a basic idea?

647
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:02,454
Master,

648
00:37:05,454 --> 00:37:06,294
just surrender.

649
00:37:12,334 --> 00:37:13,613
Am I wrong?

650
00:37:17,173 --> 00:37:19,014
Everything I've done

651
00:37:19,294 --> 00:37:20,854
was for the Wei's

652
00:37:20,854 --> 00:37:22,653
future!

653
00:37:24,093 --> 00:37:25,693
You military officials

654
00:37:25,934 --> 00:37:27,974
only resort to wars.

655
00:37:28,894 --> 00:37:30,653
Aren't the soldiers who die in battle

656
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:33,093
the Wei's citizens?

657
00:37:34,733 --> 00:37:37,253
Aren't the vast military funds

658
00:37:37,374 --> 00:37:38,454
spent year after year

659
00:37:38,454 --> 00:37:40,814
the hard-earned money of Wei's people?

660
00:37:45,934 --> 00:37:47,774
You military officials

661
00:37:47,894 --> 00:37:49,253
chase military glory,

662
00:37:49,253 --> 00:37:50,774
while ignoring the people's suffering!

663
00:37:51,253 --> 00:37:54,014
You're the true criminals of Wei!

664
00:37:54,334 --> 00:37:54,934
Nonsense!

665
00:37:55,653 --> 00:37:57,494
You were the one who started the war!

666
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,774
Our army surged
with unstoppable momentum

667
00:38:01,173 --> 00:38:02,374
and crushed the Wutuo forces.

668
00:38:03,053 --> 00:38:04,253
If we won

669
00:38:05,014 --> 00:38:06,613
the Mingshui Battle,

670
00:38:07,213 --> 00:38:08,814
the war would be concluded

671
00:38:09,613 --> 00:38:11,093
and peace would come.

672
00:38:12,774 --> 00:38:14,494
But you're blinded by personal ambition.

673
00:38:15,213 --> 00:38:16,334
To eliminate dissidents,

674
00:38:16,613 --> 00:38:17,894
you conspired with enemies,

675
00:38:18,653 --> 00:38:20,053
sacrificing thousands

676
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,573
of Xiao Army soldiers!

677
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,613
Yet you didn't repent.

678
00:38:26,334 --> 00:38:27,774
To cover your crimes,

679
00:38:28,854 --> 00:38:31,053
you aided Wutuo, our enemy,

680
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:34,133
and exposed the Wei's people

681
00:38:34,213 --> 00:38:35,774
to endless warfare!

682
00:38:36,533 --> 00:38:37,494
Xu Jingfu.

683
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:38,854
You said what you've done

684
00:38:38,894 --> 00:38:40,533
was for the Wei's future,

685
00:38:41,774 --> 00:38:43,014
yet what you've done

686
00:38:43,093 --> 00:38:44,653
serves only your personal gains.

687
00:38:51,173 --> 00:38:51,934
Xiao Jue.

688
00:38:52,573 --> 00:38:54,294
Don't you understand?

689
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:57,133
Military officials secure,
while civil officials govern.

690
00:38:57,454 --> 00:38:58,934
What strategies

691
00:38:59,053 --> 00:39:00,053
do you military officials

692
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:02,414
have, except for warfare?

693
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:04,494
Everything I've done

694
00:39:04,494 --> 00:39:06,253
was for the Wei!

695
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:12,414
Your Majesty,

696
00:39:13,093 --> 00:39:15,533
my loyalty is

697
00:39:16,294 --> 00:39:18,934
beyond question!

698
00:39:24,934 --> 00:39:25,934
If everyone had

699
00:39:26,014 --> 00:39:27,414
such loyalty as yours,

700
00:39:27,653 --> 00:39:28,894
then the nation

701
00:39:30,213 --> 00:39:31,454
would be doomed.

702
00:39:34,693 --> 00:39:35,294
Yan He.

703
00:39:35,733 --> 00:39:36,334
Li Kuang.

704
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:37,814
Yes!

705
00:39:38,894 --> 00:39:40,974
Take Xu Jingfu and He Rufei

706
00:39:41,133 --> 00:39:42,133
into custody.

707
00:39:42,653 --> 00:39:44,133
After the joint trial,

708
00:39:44,613 --> 00:39:45,533
execute them.

709
00:39:46,173 --> 00:39:46,854
Yes!

710
00:39:53,173 --> 00:39:55,014
I'll walk myself.

711
00:40:30,653 --> 00:40:31,454
Mr. Xiao.

712
00:40:31,814 --> 00:40:32,733
How should we

713
00:40:33,414 --> 00:40:34,894
deal with

714
00:40:35,173 --> 00:40:36,213
this Envoy Maningbu?

715
00:40:41,213 --> 00:40:41,774
Your Majesty,

716
00:40:42,374 --> 00:40:44,213
since Maningbu represents Wutuo

717
00:40:44,613 --> 00:40:45,573
as the envoy,

718
00:40:45,974 --> 00:40:46,894
we should

719
00:40:47,334 --> 00:40:48,894
detain him at the embassy,

720
00:40:49,774 --> 00:40:51,093
and write to the King of Wutuo,

721
00:40:51,613 --> 00:40:52,573
stating his crimes.

722
00:40:53,014 --> 00:40:54,173
His disposition rests solely

723
00:40:54,774 --> 00:40:56,414
on the King of Wutuo's response.

724
00:40:59,093 --> 00:40:59,774
Move!

725
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:07,014
Marquis Wu'an.

726
00:41:08,294 --> 00:41:10,294
Technically, you're from the He family.

727
00:41:11,014 --> 00:41:11,653
The He family

728
00:41:12,253 --> 00:41:13,173
disguised a daughter,

729
00:41:13,253 --> 00:41:14,253
deceiving the Emperor.

730
00:41:14,894 --> 00:41:15,814
