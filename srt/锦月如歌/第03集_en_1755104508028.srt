That's all

23
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,620
for today.

24
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:45,140
Remember

25
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,381
to review what you've learned.

26
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:48,860
Tomorrow,

27
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:51,420
I will personally test you.

28
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,260
Understood.

29
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,461
He always wears a mask.

30
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,260
What's wrong with him?

31
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:05,741
You'll know.

32
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:09,064
(Huainanzi)

33
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:10,780
Give it back!

34
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:11,780
Come take it back.

35
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:13,141
Come on!

36
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:14,581
Come get it.

37
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:15,540
Come on.

38
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,360
Come on.

39
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,540
You can't get it.

40
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:21,461
You can't get it.

41
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:23,944
Give it back!

42
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,380
Give it back!

43
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:33,512
Let's go.

44
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,301
Thanks.

45
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,540
Short and dumb.

46
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:39,701
I wonder

47
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,820
how you got in.

48
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,780
You eat more at night.

49
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,701
Xianchang Academy

50
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:48,820
doesn't select me by height.

51
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:50,261
Besides,

52
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,461
I'm not dumb.

53
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:04,520
=Episode 3=

54
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,901
Bye, Commander Xiao.

55
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:23,740
It's you again.

56
00:04:24,872 --> 00:04:26,770
(Xiao)

57
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,141
He's doing great today.

58
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:09,420
He doesn't lag behind.

59
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:11,740
When fighting me yesterday,

60
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:13,901
he wasn't weak at all.

61
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,980
So, he's been pretending.

62
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,300
Seems we need a more enticing bait.

63
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:19,980
Let's see

64
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,501
when his true colors emerge.

65
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,381
Since you've doubted

66
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:24,540
He Yan's identity,

67
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:26,061
why stay quiet?

68
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:28,220
When fighting him,

69
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,821
I sensed his physical weakness,

70
00:05:31,261 --> 00:05:33,100
yet his moves flowed effortlessly.

71
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,220
Clearly, he's not an amateur.

72
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:37,420
He's slippery.

73
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:39,300
Without solid evidence,

74
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,340
he won't confess.

75
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,261
Our task

76
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,980
is to expose his flaws openly.

77
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:50,821
Shen Han.

78
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:53,621
Do something for me.

79
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,328
Yes.

80
00:05:59,381 --> 00:06:00,420
- Let me help you.
- Move.

81
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,100
Come on!

82
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,360
(Jiuqi Camp)

83
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,340
So impressive!

84
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,780
If I could

85
00:07:00,061 --> 00:07:00,901
be as brave as them,

86
00:07:00,901 --> 00:07:01,608
that'd be great.

87
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:02,941
Who are they?

88
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:04,061
Why so valiant?

89
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:05,180
Jiuqi Camp.

90
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,821
Jiuqi Camp?

91
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,581
What's that?

92
00:07:08,821 --> 00:07:09,740
You don't know?

93
00:07:09,941 --> 00:07:11,220
It was founded by Marshal Xiao.

94
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:13,141
It accepts elite warriors only.

95
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:14,621
All in black armor.

96
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:16,420
They're invincible,

97
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,941
the core force of Xiao Army.

98
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,180
All enemies fear them.

99
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:20,340
Why's everyone

100
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,021
suddenly talking about them?

101
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:23,100
Someone

102
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,061
started it.

103
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:25,261
But no one

104
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:26,381
would refuse joining, right?

105
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:32,061
(They're talking about Jiuqi Camp.)

106
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:34,780
(Could it be planned?)

107
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,381
(Xiao Jue noticed something)

108
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,300
(during last night's fight.)

109
00:07:41,021 --> 00:07:42,340
(He set a bait)

110
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:43,701
(to hook me.)

111
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:46,184
(Baiting me?)

112
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,901
(I'll play along)

113
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,901
(and join the camp.)

114
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:51,100
(I will do it honorably,)

115
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:51,980
(flawlessly.)

116
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:54,261
(Who's bait? Who's prey?)

117
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:55,461
(Game's still on.)

118
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:56,808
Mr. Shen.

119
00:07:57,461 --> 00:07:58,056
Mr. Shen.

120
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,621
Zoning out?

121
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,061
Mr. Shen.

122
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:05,192
Work harder,

123
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:06,780
and you can join them too.

124
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,100
They're so formidable.

125
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,100
I'm joining them.

126
00:08:14,381 --> 00:08:15,660
Don't rush to join them

127
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,501
just because of that.

128
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,300
They often spearhead the frontlines,

129
00:08:18,461 --> 00:08:19,180
where casualties

130
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,141
remain alarmingly high.

131
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,501
That's perfect then.

132
00:08:22,061 --> 00:08:23,141
They need fresh recruits.

133
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,340
I need military merits.

134
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,901
If I join the Jiuqi Camp,

135
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,141
it's win-win.

136
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,061
We do

137
00:08:30,061 --> 00:08:31,581
select one recruit annually.

138
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,552
However,

139
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:34,660
it must be
the most outstanding candidate.

140
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:35,940
This year,

141
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,780
save yourselves the trouble.

142
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,501
The best candidate is

143
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:40,981
right before you.

144
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:43,621
Good.

145
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,341
I'll be watching your performance.

146
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:53,501
He.

147
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:54,056
Come quick!

148
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:55,141
Look, meat flatbreads.

149
00:09:03,981 --> 00:09:04,700
That flatbread

150
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:05,861
is mine.

151
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,261
Yours?

152
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:08,981
Call its name

153
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,660
and see if it answers you.

154
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,901
Who can prove this is yours?

155
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:14,540
I'm eating it.

156
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,700
What can you do?

157
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,981
What can I do about it?

158
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:23,464
You...

159
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,264
You...

160
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:25,672
Yes.

161
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:26,856
I did it.

162
00:09:27,221 --> 00:09:28,021
Who can verify that?

163
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,981
What can you do about it?

164
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:31,621
You...

165
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,101
Want a fight?

166
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,552
Fine.

167
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:38,221
Wait for me after training.

168
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:39,141
I'll make you pay.

169
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:41,060
Enough, He.

170
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:42,540
Don't stoop to his level.

171
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,300
Since he took my food once,

172
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,820
he might do it again.

173
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:47,780
If he takes my food daily,

174
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:49,341
should I starve

175
00:09:49,341 --> 00:09:50,101
every single day?

176
00:09:50,741 --> 00:09:51,261
That is

177
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:53,261
so not fair.

178
00:09:53,501 --> 00:09:54,901
Are you talking with me

179
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:56,141
about fairness?

180
00:09:57,261 --> 00:09:58,261
With your weakness,

181
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,180
you won't

182
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,741
survive a month here.

183
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,780
Not even a month.

184
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:03,101
No need to wait.

185
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,660
In ten days,

186
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:05,861
at training field,

187
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,221
I'll defeat you in archery,

188
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,381
your best skill.

189
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,861
Are you crazy?

190
00:10:17,261 --> 00:10:19,460
You understand your own words?

191
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,540
Which part

192
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,580
did you not hear?

193
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:23,700
Let me repeat myself.

194
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,381
In ten days,

195
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:27,501
I will defeat you.

196
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:29,420
Pretty boy,

197
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:31,141
you're very bold.

198
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,576
Alright.

199
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:35,141
That's a bold wager.

200
00:10:35,141 --> 00:10:36,341
- Yes.
- Good.

201
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,820
If you lose,

202
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,420
you'll become an army cook.

203
00:10:41,221 --> 00:10:41,832
Deal.

204
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:43,540
But if you lose,

205
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:45,101
you'll call me boss.

206
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:50,940
Don't humiliate yourself.

207
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,820
In ten days,

208
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,101
I'll challenge you to a spear duel.

209
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,540
Do you dare to accept it?

210
00:10:57,861 --> 00:10:59,460
Since you're so reckless,

211
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:00,901
I'll play along.

212
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,528
Good.

213
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:05,341
In ten days,

214
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,420
we'll compete.

215
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,460
How dare you!

216
00:11:09,381 --> 00:11:10,741
- Commander.
- Commander.

217
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,780
Brawling right after joining the army?

218
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:14,700
Have you no respect for discipline?

219
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,141
It's okay.

220
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:19,460
He wants to join the Jiuqi Camp.

221
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:21,300
I'll see

222
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,460
if he's qualified.

You work so hard,

246
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,501
yet you're still weak.

247
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,101
The sneaky person at the bathing pool

248
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,580
was you, right?

249
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,101
A while ago,

250
00:13:28,261 --> 00:13:29,901
I was exhausted from training.

251
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:31,580
So, I went to bathe to relax.

252
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:35,060
The person who was bathing that night

253
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,700
was actually you.

254
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,420
However,

255
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,060
I panicked and fled recklessly

256
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:41,101
that night.

257
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:42,861
I hope you won't blame me.

258
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:45,261
You panicked?

259
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,261
Sure, I did.

260
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:51,901
You're suspicious

261
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,420
and a liar.

262
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:55,501
What's your real intention?

263
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,760
I want a trainer.

264
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:00,264
What?

265
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,101
No offense,

266
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,141
but please train me, Commander.

267
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:12,820
What makes you think

268
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,060
I'll train you?

269
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,501
Otherwise, did you

270
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:19,420
come out so late at night

271
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,901
to ambush a recruit for fun?

272
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,660
I know

273
00:14:23,221 --> 00:14:24,460
you're concerned about me.

274
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,660
You think

275
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,861
I have potential.

276
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,540
Practice needs a partner.

277
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,861
Practicing alone

278
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,021
won't work out.

279
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,700
If you train me,

280
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,261
I'm certain I'll make great progress.

281
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:38,180
Quite cheeky.

282
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,621
If you can resist ten strikes

283
00:14:46,621 --> 00:14:47,420
in a circle,

284
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,420
I'll train you.

285
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:52,700
Deal.

286
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,460
Can't even hold it.

287
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:56,940
Why should I train you?

288
00:15:57,141 --> 00:15:57,704
I...

289
00:16:38,221 --> 00:16:38,861
Commander.

290
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:40,700
Ten strikes done.

291
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:43,060
I'm still in.

292
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:53,060
My fault.

293
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:54,180
Accidentally,

294
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,621
I offended you.

295
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:01,861
Commander.

296
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,141
A promise

297
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,220
is a promise.

298
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,740
You can't go back on it.

299
00:17:06,381 --> 00:17:07,420
Breaking a promise

300
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,101
is a disgrace.

301
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,384
Commander.

302
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,301
Every night, Xu hour.

303
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:26,381
Thank you.

304
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,940
Thank you, master.

305
00:17:33,821 --> 00:17:34,940
This is your first lesson.

306
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:36,621
Remember your words.

307
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,781
If you can't win,

308
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,821
get out of Yezhou Garrison.

309
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:52,740
Since you're using
the Jiuqi Camp as bait,

310
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,381
I'll absolutely

311
00:17:54,381 --> 00:17:55,500
take this chance.

312
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,141
I'll certainly use you

313
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:01,500
to succeed.

314
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,861
He learned quite quickly.

315
00:18:47,301 --> 00:18:47,901
(Commander.)

316
00:18:48,341 --> 00:18:49,061
(A promise)

317
00:18:49,381 --> 00:18:50,220
(is a promise.)

318
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:51,700
(You can't go back on it.)

319
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,341
(Breaking a promise)

320
00:18:53,901 --> 00:18:55,061
(is a disgrace.)

321
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,260
I never agreed to anything.

322
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:15,781
I've mastered the techniques,

323
00:19:16,341 --> 00:19:17,460
yet he shows no concern.

324
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,624
It's not good.

325
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,341
I must make him

326
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:21,660
witness my progress.

327
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,680
Commander.

328
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:30,248
Are you there?

329
00:20:31,341 --> 00:20:32,101
Qinglang.

330
00:20:35,781 --> 00:20:36,700
Long time no see.

331
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,460
(I once asked a swordsmith)

332
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:44,381
to forge two swords.

333
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:46,420
One is named Yinqiu.

334
00:20:46,901 --> 00:20:48,220
I gave that to Huaijin

335
00:20:49,141 --> 00:20:49,940
when he came of age.

336
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,144
This one

337
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,420
is named Qinglang.

338
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,736
Today,

339
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,740
I'll give it to you.

340
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:58,920
Father.

341
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,260
Why did you give him Qinglang?

342
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,020
This sword is valuable.

343
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,341
I can't take it.

344
00:21:06,821 --> 00:21:07,980
Constant effort

345
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,260
brings success.

346
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:10,940
Someday,

347
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,381
you two will become

348
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,541
the twin stars of Wei,

349
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:14,861
working together.

350
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:15,816
Wielding swords

351
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,101
to defend our land

352
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,541
and protect people.

353
00:21:20,061 --> 00:21:20,700
Take it.

354
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,224
I will not

355
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,940
betray your trust.

356
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,061
You're unworthy of this Qinglang Sword

357
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,420
from my father.

358
00:22:07,381 --> 00:22:08,660
It's quite a sharp sword.

359
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,700
It's rare to see.

360
00:22:10,141 --> 00:22:11,260
So, I couldn't help

361
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,700
touching it.

362
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,660
Commander.

363
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,500
You're magnanimous.

364
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,940
You won't blame me, will you?

365
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,980
The sword you're holding

366
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,621
is quite great too!

367
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,301
Why did you come to my tent?

368
00:22:32,781 --> 00:22:34,101
I've practiced diligently

369
00:22:34,381 --> 00:22:35,980
and mastered what you taught me.

370
00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:37,821
Aren't you going to check on me?

371
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,020
I'm busy.

372
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,240
Come.

373
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,420
I knew

374
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,581
you were responsible.

375
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,180
Bet on Wang Ba.

376
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,141
Quick! Tell me!

377
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,020
Who to bet on?

378
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:05,220
On Wang Ba.

379
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,460
- On Wang Ba.
- Me too.

380
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:07,341
And you?

381
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,341
Jiang Jiao.

382
00:23:08,341 --> 00:23:09,740
Jiang Jiao? Two on Jiang Jiao?

383
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,781
(Jiang Jiao, He Yan, Wang Ba)
Three flatbreads?

384
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:11,621
I'm all in!

385
00:23:11,821 --> 00:23:12,660
My bet's on Wang Ba.

386
00:23:12,781 --> 00:23:13,581
Great!

387
00:23:13,581 --> 00:23:14,260
- Wang Ba!
- One!

388
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,420
- On Jiang Jiao?
- Six!

389
00:23:15,581 --> 00:23:16,821
- Jiang Jiao!
- Jiang Jiao!

390
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,541
(Wang Ba)
Five on Jiang.

391
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:19,740
Who's got flatbreads left?

392
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,980
Six on Wang Ba.

393
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,180
- And you?
- Jiang Jiao!

394
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,381
You note it all down?

395
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:25,576
(He Yan)
Of course.

396
00:23:26,861 --> 00:23:27,740
(Someone actually bet)

397
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,901
(on He Yan earlier than me.)

398
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,088
Guys!

399
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,101
Listen,

400
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,301
I am

401
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,581
betting ten flatbreads

402
00:23:34,381 --> 00:23:35,368
(Jiang Jiao, He Yan, Wang Ba)
on He Yan.

403
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,220
- What?
- Sir.

404
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,020
Are you sure?

405
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,700
Absolutely!

406
00:23:39,341 --> 00:23:40,861
Very impressive, Mr. Cheng.

407
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,980
He's never short on flatbreads.

408
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:45,061
Place your bets! Quickly!

409
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:46,901
Wang Ba!

410
00:23:47,101 --> 00:23:48,700
- Wang Ba!
- Go!

411
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,381
Wang Ba, come on!

412
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:50,381
Wang Ba, come on!

413
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,180
You'll win.

414
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,740
- You'll win.
- Wang Ba will win!

415
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,700
- He!
- Wang Ba!

416
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,581
Go for it!

417
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,740
Show your skills!

418
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,940
Go, Wang Ba!

419
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,700
Wang Ba!

420
00:24:00,821 --> 00:24:02,260
Wang Ba, come on!

421
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,020
Wang Ba, come on!

422
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,700
Wang Ba!

423
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,500
Show your skills!

424
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,141
You'll win!

425
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,061
Wang Ba!

426
00:24:06,061 --> 00:24:06,740
Go for it, He!

427
00:24:06,861 --> 00:24:09,020
Wang Ba!

428
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,141
Go for it, He!

429
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:11,341
He!

430
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,381
Wang Ba!

431
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:13,260
Go for it, He!

432
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:13,901
You'll win!

433
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,541
Lei Hou.

434
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,621
You bet on me?

435
00:24:16,061 --> 00:24:16,980
I didn't bet on anyone.

436
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,460
Hey.

437
00:24:19,101 --> 00:24:20,381
Change your mind now,

438
00:24:20,381 --> 00:24:21,660
or you'll humiliate yourself.

439
00:24:22,781 --> 00:24:23,341
Exactly!

440
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,260
Give it up!

441
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:27,880
So funny.

442
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:29,621
I was about to say the same.

443
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,621
You'll regret it.

444
00:24:32,621 --> 00:24:35,301
Wang Ba!

445
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:36,101
You'll win!

446
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,460
Wang Ba, come on!

447
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,260
You'll win!

448
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:39,621
Wang Ba, come on!

449
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,500
Wang Ba, come on!

450
00:24:50,301 --> 00:24:51,420
Wang Ba won!

451
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,541
Impressive!

452
00:24:57,301 --> 00:24:58,141
Wang Ba won.

453
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:03,220
Awesome!

454
00:25:03,341 --> 00:25:04,420
Wang Ba won!

455
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,581
Impressive.

456
00:25:07,101 --> 00:25:07,861
Give it up!

457
00:25:12,061 --> 00:25:12,821
Give it up!

458
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,020
Give it up!

459
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,141
- Give it up!
- Be quiet!

460
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,420
You're humiliating yourself.

461
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,301
Exactly.

462
00:25:25,301 --> 00:25:26,220
Indeed.

463
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,020
Give it up!

464
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,940
Give it up!

465
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,020
Look at him.

466
00:25:30,101 --> 00:25:31,420
I knew it.

467
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,621
He's bound to lose.

468
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:33,821
Give it up!

469
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,861
Give it up!

470
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,101
Give it up!

471
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:51,901
Get out of here.

472
00:26:06,301 --> 00:26:06,952
Well...

473
00:26:07,821 --> 00:26:08,740
Pierced right through!

474
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,541
Quite strong.

475
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:11,341
Is he that skilled?

476
00:26:12,141 --> 00:26:13,420
- Well...
- Precise and powerful.

477
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,700
He's pretty strong.

478
00:26:17,341 --> 00:26:18,381
Congrats!

479
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:19,901
Among these recruits,

480
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:21,700
you've got a capable heroine.

481
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:22,472
No,

482
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,700
a capable hero.

483
00:26:24,861 --> 00:26:26,020
Both Wang Ba and He Yan

484
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,101
are doing great.

485
00:26:27,341 --> 00:26:28,781
Credit goes to Mr. Shen.

486
00:26:29,061 --> 00:26:29,940
Not really, Mr. Cheng.

487
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,341
I can't claim the credit.

488
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,341
Commander Xiao's

489
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,500
training methods work.

490
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,020
My discerning eyes

491
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,381
never misjudge talent.

492
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,861
Remember our wager?

493
00:26:39,341 --> 00:26:40,381
No backing out.

494
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:43,141
Mr. Shen.

495
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,101
Who's your pick?

496
00:26:44,861 --> 00:26:45,740
Wang Ba

497
00:26:46,101 --> 00:26:46,781
has potential.

498
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,101
He was a bandit

499
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:48,940
and a rebel.

500
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:49,861
But he's good

501
00:26:50,061 --> 00:26:51,180
at archery.

502
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,500
He Yan

503
00:26:52,901 --> 00:26:53,660
works hard.

504
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,581
He's mild-tempered.

505
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,460
A few years later,

506
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:57,660
he'll become

507
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,101
the best of the recruits.

508
00:26:59,101 --> 00:27:00,301
You've misjudged, Mr. Shen.

509
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,420
The rebellious one

510
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:03,460
isn't Wang Ba.

511
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:07,101
But He Yan

512
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,980
is getting more interesting.

513
00:27:13,141 --> 00:27:13,901
After your rest,

514
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,260
- let's...
- I'm rested.

515
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,861
Let's begin.

516
00:27:18,821 --> 00:27:22,781
- Go!
- You can do it!

517
00:27:22,901 --> 00:27:24,460
- Jiang Jiao, go for it!
- Go!

518
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:25,460
Go for it!

519
00:27:26,901 --> 00:27:28,220
- Come on!
- You can do it!

520
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:32,712
Good!

521
00:27:33,381 --> 00:27:34,581
Excellent!

522
00:27:35,141 --> 00:27:35,660
Keep going!

523
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:36,861
Go for it!

524
00:27:38,861 --> 00:27:39,901
Amazing!

525
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,192
Go for it!

526
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:57,541
Bravo!

527
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,536
Splendid!

528
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,821
Who won?

529
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,020
(Given his strength,)

530
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,660
(is he actually a recruit?)

531
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,500
Why

532
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,420
is He just defending?

533
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:12,180
Faster! Quicker!

534
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,500
One more strike to beat him!

535
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:28,420
(He's testing me.)

536
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,180
That dodge

537
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:30,980
was so good.

538
00:28:32,781 --> 00:28:33,320
Commander.

539
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,460
He Yan's evasive maneuver is

540
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:35,980
like yours.

541
00:28:40,101 --> 00:28:40,861
Yet he failed

542
00:28:40,901 --> 00:28:41,940
to dodge your stone?

543
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,781
He chose not to dodge.

544
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:46,940
(No weapons)

545
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:47,720
(can defeat)

546
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,616
(spears.)

547
00:29:00,821 --> 00:29:02,341
He Yan!

548
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,740
Few people are skilled at spear.

549
00:29:04,101 --> 00:29:04,901
But once they do,

550
00:29:05,301 --> 00:29:06,020
they will not

551
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,541
fear all other weapons.

552
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,584
Well done!

553
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:11,381
This Jiang Jiao is useless.

554
00:29:11,781 --> 00:29:12,420
Unbelievable.

555
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:15,660
Pretty boy.

556
00:29:17,901 --> 00:29:18,500
What?

557
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:22,700
A bet's a bet.

558
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,032
Boss.

559
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:28,101
Oh, right.

560
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,141
I almost forgot.

561
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,621
There's someone else

562
00:29:36,581 --> 00:29:37,740
who needs to call me boss.

563
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:44,420
Wang Ba.

564
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,740
It's your turn.

565
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:47,901
You're not trying to back out, are you?

566
00:29:55,901 --> 00:29:57,020
Move aside!

567
00:30:03,341 --> 00:30:04,861
B-Bo...

568
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,700
You can...

569
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,740
Boss.

570
00:30:11,141 --> 00:30:12,061
You heard me.

571
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,301
Sure, I did.

572
00:30:13,861 --> 00:30:14,740
I just never expected

573
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,821
you'd actually do it.

574
00:30:16,861 --> 00:30:19,541
As a real man...

575
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,260
That's it.

576
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,141
I did it.

577
00:30:23,141 --> 00:30:23,660
Stop looking!

578
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,500
Get out of here!

579
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,500
Get out of here!

580
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,061
Let's go.

581
00:30:30,141 --> 00:30:31,341
- Get out of here.
- Go.

582
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,621
Let's train harder.

583
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,541
I lost the bet,

584
00:30:33,901 --> 00:30:35,341
but I watched a good match.

585
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,141
Sure.

586
00:30:36,141 --> 00:30:36,660
Let's go.

587
00:30:37,341 --> 00:30:38,061
Commander.

588
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,500
Commander.

589
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,621
You forgot this.

590
00:30:46,621 --> 00:30:47,260
You did well.

591
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,621
Keep it.

592
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:52,420
I'll remember

593
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,061
your kindness forever.

594
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,061
Coming!

595
00:31:04,381 --> 00:31:05,000
Flatbreads.

596
00:31:06,901 --> 00:31:07,621
Guys! Listen up!

597
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,260
Thanks to Mr. He,

598
00:31:09,581 --> 00:31:11,180
I won the bet

599
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,381
in today's match.

600
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:13,101
Tonight,

601
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:13,901
it's my treat.

602
00:31:14,061 --> 00:31:15,220
Just help yourselves.

603
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,740
What are you waiting for?

604
00:31:17,901 --> 00:31:18,700
All of us

605
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,581
should thank Mr. Cheng.

606
00:31:21,101 --> 00:31:22,141
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

607
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,101
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

608
00:31:24,781 --> 00:31:25,821
Let's eat!

609
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,861
Let's eat!

610
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,621
Smells good!

611
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:31,980
I know

612
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,581
I am good-looking.

613
00:31:33,901 --> 00:31:34,581
However,

614
00:31:34,581 --> 00:31:35,901
you staring so boldly at me

615
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,381
is making me

616
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,740
feel rather uncomfortable.

617
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,700
Mr. Cheng.

618
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,781
You're overthinking.

619
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:43,260
I doubt

620
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,500
the flatbreads you won

621
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,500
are enough for us.

622
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,061
This is my way of repaying you.

623
00:31:48,301 --> 00:31:49,940
You may lose more than you gain.

624
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,020
It's worth it.

625
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,740
Bring the soup if it's ready.

626
00:31:55,141 --> 00:31:57,220
Great!

627
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,061
Smells so good.

628
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,141
Smells so good.

629
00:32:02,141 --> 00:32:03,700
Exactly! Where are the bowls?

630
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,220
- Give me a bowl.
- Thanks, Mr. Cheng!

631
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:06,420
The soup is served.

632
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,341
Your title as Yezhou's top warrior

633
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,581
might be in jeopardy.

634
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:10,901
Mr. He

635
00:32:11,101 --> 00:32:12,621
has trained hard this month.

636
00:32:12,821 --> 00:32:14,420
That's why he shocked everyone today.

637
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,260
Both of us

638
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,660
stop being jealous.

639
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,301
Mr. He.

640
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,821
Congrats!

641
00:32:23,301 --> 00:32:24,020
Thanks, Mr. Lei.

642
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:30,792
Commander.

643
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,980
At the training field,

644
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:32,940
you said

645
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,781
he chose not to dodge.
What did you mean?

646
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:36,861
I used the Jiuqi Camp as bait

647
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,660
to lure him to duel.

648
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,500
While he was overwhelmed,

649
00:32:40,621 --> 00:32:41,420
I secretly acted

650
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,220
to force him to reveal some flaw.

651
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:45,901
Unexpectedly,

652
00:32:47,141 --> 00:32:47,901
he actually

653
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,061
discerned my intention.

654
00:32:49,621 --> 00:32:50,660
So, he didn't dodge.

655
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,420
He's not only resilient,

656
00:32:55,861 --> 00:32:56,581
but also clever.

657
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,781
He's a formidable opponent.

658
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,061
Anyway,

659
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,301
He Yan

660
00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:03,460
is definitely up to no good.

661
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,500
Shall I go arrest him first?

662
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,581
No rush.

663
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,020
So, you already have a plan?

664
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,460
These new recruits

665
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,940
have been training

666
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,700
for a full month.

667
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,381
It's time for their competition.

668
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:17,220
Then

669
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,381
the truth will reveal itself.
