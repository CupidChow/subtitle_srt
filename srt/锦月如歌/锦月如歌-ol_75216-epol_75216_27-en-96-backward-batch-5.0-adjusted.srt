=Episode 27=

23
00:01:39,987 --> 00:01:41,472
By wearing that mask this time,

24
00:01:42,508 --> 00:01:44,467
you've terrified the Wutuo forces.

25
00:01:45,107 --> 00:01:46,547
He Rufei will certainly use this

26
00:01:46,987 --> 00:01:48,267
to confirm your identity.

27
00:01:50,987 --> 00:01:52,228
Since I've come to Rundu,

28
00:01:52,668 --> 00:01:53,948
I'm not afraid of him knowing.

29
00:01:55,107 --> 00:01:56,028
When I return,

30
00:01:56,948 --> 00:01:59,708
I'll stand before him
with my head held high.

31
00:02:00,747 --> 00:02:01,827
I'll make sure he learns

32
00:02:03,988 --> 00:02:06,868
who the real General Feihong is.

33
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:11,028
Speaking of which,

34
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:13,828
since He Rufei and Xu Jingfu

35
00:02:13,988 --> 00:02:15,268
have been colluding for so long,

36
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:16,627
there must be evidence

37
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:18,347
of their collaboration.

38
00:02:18,947 --> 00:02:19,828
And that evidence

39
00:02:20,268 --> 00:02:21,108
is in the capital.

40
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,070
That's why I want to return sooner

41
00:02:23,308 --> 00:02:25,227
to investigate potential leads.

42
00:02:26,268 --> 00:02:27,108
Alright.

43
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:28,347
I'll go with you.

44
00:02:39,388 --> 00:02:40,228
Young Master.

45
00:02:41,148 --> 00:02:41,988
What happened to you?

46
00:02:50,308 --> 00:02:53,308
I thought you sent Miss He
medicine to restore her energy.

47
00:03:12,268 --> 00:03:13,108
Yingxiang.

48
00:03:14,148 --> 00:03:14,988
Tell me,

49
00:03:16,507 --> 00:03:18,227
why do people yearn for light?

50
00:03:19,907 --> 00:03:20,868
Because of its warmth.

51
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:23,548
But Young Master,

52
00:03:24,507 --> 00:03:25,947
not everyone needs it.

53
00:03:35,907 --> 00:03:36,747
Aren't you afraid

54
00:03:36,947 --> 00:03:37,787
of fire anymore?

55
00:03:41,108 --> 00:03:42,548
I received warmth.

56
00:03:42,988 --> 00:03:44,347
So the fear vanished.

57
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:48,308
Is it because of Miss He?

58
00:04:08,588 --> 00:04:10,187
Temporary gains and losses mean little.

59
00:04:10,828 --> 00:04:12,467
I've been maneuvering against Master

60
00:04:12,828 --> 00:04:15,867
for so long to gain power and strength

61
00:04:17,068 --> 00:04:18,467
to protect what I value.

62
00:04:19,227 --> 00:04:20,427
Even so,

63
00:04:20,768 --> 00:04:22,708
you shouldn't have risked your life

64
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:25,268
and come to such a dangerous place.

65
00:04:25,947 --> 00:04:28,188
You barely dispelled
Chancellor Xu's suspicions.

66
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:29,748
Then you came here recklessly.

67
00:04:30,508 --> 00:04:32,307
Chancellor Xu may hold it against you.

68
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:34,388
It is dangerous here,

69
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:36,867
but an official can't

70
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:38,667
prioritize personal safety.

71
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:40,948
I'm obligated to come here.

72
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:44,148
And my decision proves to be right.

73
00:04:45,148 --> 00:04:46,268
I defended Rundu

74
00:04:46,907 --> 00:04:48,188
and protected its people.

75
00:04:49,028 --> 00:04:50,268
And after this battle,

76
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,307
His Majesty will trust me more.

77
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:54,347
Also, I came here

78
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:56,708
to verify something.

79
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,948
What is it?

80
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,307
Yingxiang.

81
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:02,588
How do you think

82
00:05:03,107 --> 00:05:05,467
General Feihong
before the Mingshui Battle

83
00:05:05,828 --> 00:05:07,307
is different from

84
00:05:07,628 --> 00:05:08,468
the current one?

85
00:05:09,948 --> 00:05:11,588
The former General Feihong

86
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:13,907
was valiant and strategically brilliant.

87
00:05:14,828 --> 00:05:16,347
The current one,

88
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:18,867
as seen in the recent Huayuan Battle,

89
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:20,628
won the battle

90
00:05:20,707 --> 00:05:23,068
by sacrificing seven warriors at once.

91
00:05:23,508 --> 00:05:24,748
This hardly matches

92
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:25,948
his reputation.

93
00:05:27,188 --> 00:05:28,388
And in the Rundu Battle,

94
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,148
though General Feihong

95
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:32,307
is said to treat his troops like family,

96
00:05:33,107 --> 00:05:34,907
he completely ignored

97
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,307
Li Kuang's pleas for reinforcement.

98
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,588
This is nothing like what we've heard.

99
00:05:41,787 --> 00:05:42,667
On the contrary,

100
00:05:43,588 --> 00:05:44,428
back in Jiyang,

101
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:46,148
He Yan reacted weirdly

102
00:05:46,227 --> 00:05:47,467
when she heard that He Rufei

103
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,867
made Chai Anxi withhold

104
00:05:49,268 --> 00:05:50,588
Xiao Zhongwu's plea for help.

105
00:05:51,547 --> 00:05:53,188
And after she heard that seven out of

106
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:54,588
the Eight Warriors died,

107
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:56,708
she wielded her whip all night.

108
00:05:57,227 --> 00:05:59,107
Only deep bonds could cause

109
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:00,467
such a reaction.

110
00:06:00,948 --> 00:06:03,427
She then rushed to Rundu overnight
to help Li Kuang

111
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:04,867
defend the city.

112
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:06,507
And Li Kuang

113
00:06:07,027 --> 00:06:09,188
is one of He Rufei's Eight Warriors.

114
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:11,427
Connecting the dots,

115
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:13,148
the coincidences pile up.

116
00:06:15,907 --> 00:06:17,347
Are you suggesting

117
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:20,708
the current General Feihong
is an impostor

118
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:22,307
and Miss He is...?

119
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:23,147
That's right.

120
00:06:25,307 --> 00:06:27,227
That's my second reason for coming here.

121
00:06:27,828 --> 00:06:28,708
Only in Rundu

122
00:06:28,987 --> 00:06:30,347
can I unravel these doubts.

123
00:06:30,987 --> 00:06:32,107
And it's proven

124
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:33,188
that I'm right.

125
00:06:34,068 --> 00:06:34,987
She knows about

126
00:06:34,987 --> 00:06:36,268
the secret tunnel,

127
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:38,708
masters He Rufei's martial skills.

128
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:40,427
and even impersonates

129
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:42,028
General Feihong perfectly.

130
00:06:42,548 --> 00:06:44,748
All these clues point to her,

131
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:46,548
proving

132
00:06:47,948 --> 00:06:48,788
that she

133
00:06:49,227 --> 00:06:51,508
is the true General Feihong.

134
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:53,307
Young Master.

135
00:06:53,427 --> 00:06:54,628
You can report this

136
00:06:54,787 --> 00:06:56,588
to Chancellor Xu once we return.

137
00:06:57,148 --> 00:06:58,867
Tell him that you came

138
00:06:59,068 --> 00:06:59,948
to investigate.

139
00:07:00,547 --> 00:07:01,588
In that case,

140
00:07:02,628 --> 00:07:03,867
he won't blame you

141
00:07:03,948 --> 00:07:05,347
for coming here without permission.

142
00:07:06,268 --> 00:07:07,708
From Chai Anxi's account,

143
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:10,148
Master had contacted
the current He Rufei

144
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:12,427
even before the Mingshui Battle.

145
00:07:14,148 --> 00:07:16,307
This isn't merely He Rufei's secret.

146
00:07:16,628 --> 00:07:18,227
It's also Master's secret.

147
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,467
Given his trust issue,

148
00:07:20,948 --> 00:07:22,148
I can't tell him that

149
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:24,188
I've learned his secrets.

150
00:07:25,107 --> 00:07:26,227
So how will you

151
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:28,588
explain it to Chancellor Xu?

152
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:30,588
He Rufei has caused so much trouble.

153
00:07:30,948 --> 00:07:32,068
Xiao Jue and He Yan

154
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:33,427
won't let this go easily.

155
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,268
He Rufei is in deep trouble.

156
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:37,028
Master lacks capable aides.

157
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:38,188
He'll need me.

158
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:40,388
And his past misdeeds

159
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:41,948
will inevitably surface.

160
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:43,987
He'll reap what he's sown.

161
00:07:46,028 --> 00:07:47,068
Though a mentor is to be

162
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,427
revered as a father,

163
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,948
when it comes to Wei,

164
00:07:51,828 --> 00:07:53,028
I have my principles.

165
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:55,227
I can't feign ignorance

166
00:07:55,987 --> 00:07:57,028
of his treason

167
00:07:58,268 --> 00:08:00,028
just because he's my master.

168
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:03,588
Yingxiang.

169
00:08:04,107 --> 00:08:04,947
Make preparations.

170
00:08:05,148 --> 00:08:06,667
We'll head back tomorrow.

171
00:08:07,107 --> 00:08:07,947
Understood.

172
00:08:17,227 --> 00:08:18,667
Mr. He, Commander Xiao.

173
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:21,868
Mr. Chu.

174
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:28,468
I'm heading back today

175
00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:29,947
and came to say goodbye.

176
00:08:30,348 --> 00:08:31,188
Today?

177
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:34,907
We will return soon.

178
00:08:35,468 --> 00:08:37,427
Won't you join us
to look after each other?

179
00:08:39,868 --> 00:08:40,787
To be honest,

180
00:08:41,348 --> 00:08:42,268
I came here

181
00:08:42,508 --> 00:08:43,707
without Master's permission.

182
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:46,508
So I must return earlier

183
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:47,707
to ask for forgiveness.

184
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:50,907
Mr. Chu.

185
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:52,188
Take a seat.

186
00:08:58,148 --> 00:08:58,988
Mr. Chu.

187
00:08:59,187 --> 00:09:01,667
About what happened
in Jiyang, Huayuan, and Rundu,

188
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:03,707
have you suspected

189
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:05,268
that these battles

190
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:06,748
weren't coincidental?

191
00:09:07,868 --> 00:09:10,228
These battles were indeed suspicious.

192
00:09:10,868 --> 00:09:11,827
Back in Jiyang,

193
00:09:12,348 --> 00:09:14,988
we found Wutuo spies in the city.

194
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:17,187
As for Huayuan and Rundu,

195
00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:19,108
Wutuo forces

196
00:09:19,707 --> 00:09:22,628
couldn't have besieged them
so effortlessly without informants.

197
00:09:23,228 --> 00:09:24,228
Rundu especially.

198
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:26,028
Commander Li mentioned

199
00:09:26,547 --> 00:09:27,868
that the city's defenses

200
00:09:28,628 --> 00:09:30,707
were utterly useless during the siege.

201
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:32,228
It proves that

202
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:33,707
the enemies

203
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:36,148
obtained Rundu's defense layouts
long beforehand.

204
00:09:37,748 --> 00:09:38,588
Mr. Chu.

205
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:39,868
As smart as you are,

206
00:09:40,587 --> 00:09:42,268
you must have realized

207
00:09:42,628 --> 00:09:43,468
that all the traces

208
00:09:43,907 --> 00:09:45,547
point to one person.

209
00:09:46,508 --> 00:09:47,508
Yet even so,

210
00:09:48,228 --> 00:09:51,067
won't you rein in your path?

211
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:56,228
Everything points

212
00:09:56,587 --> 00:09:57,787
directly to my master.

213
00:09:59,787 --> 00:10:01,148
But these are speculations.

214
00:10:02,108 --> 00:10:03,667
Even with Chai Anxi's testimony,

215
00:10:03,787 --> 00:10:04,667
there's no proof.

216
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:06,427
I owe everything to my master.

217
00:10:06,628 --> 00:10:08,628
I can't sever my ties with him
until I find

218
00:10:08,868 --> 00:10:09,708
solid evidence.

219
00:10:10,988 --> 00:10:12,108
Even if there is evidence,

220
00:10:13,228 --> 00:10:14,068
you wouldn't

221
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:15,988
forsake your master, would you?

222
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:18,148
After all, you learned the way

223
00:10:18,508 --> 00:10:20,148
of doing things from him.

224
00:10:23,787 --> 00:10:24,787
Please elaborate.

225
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:26,748
After the Battle of Que City,

226
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:29,187
all sorts of rumors ran rampant.

227
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,427
Our investigation

228
00:10:30,827 --> 00:10:32,348
suggested it was your doing.

229
00:10:33,748 --> 00:10:34,588
In Yezhou,

230
00:10:34,988 --> 00:10:36,348
Feinu fought a masked woman

231
00:10:36,748 --> 00:10:38,228
while retrieving the tax ledgers.

232
00:10:38,827 --> 00:10:39,707
Her physique

233
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:41,748
and mannerisms

234
00:10:42,947 --> 00:10:45,667
closely resembled your maid.

235
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:49,348
Coincidentally,

236
00:10:50,307 --> 00:10:51,707
that same maid was absent

237
00:10:52,587 --> 00:10:53,748
from your side at the time.

238
00:10:55,228 --> 00:10:57,268
Later, Sun Xiangfu was assassinated.

239
00:10:58,748 --> 00:10:59,588
All these events

240
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:01,667
seem

241
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:04,348
connected to you.

242
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:05,787
Commander Xiao,

243
00:11:06,547 --> 00:11:09,228
you yourself used the word "seem".

244
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:12,748
Baseless claims aren't worth mentioning.

245
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:15,747
However,

246
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:17,587
I've found something else

247
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:20,028
rather intriguing.

248
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,988
While investigating
the assassins who killed Chai Anxi

249
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:24,628
in Jiyang,

250
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,468
someone secretly helped us,

251
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:30,228
making the inquiry remarkably smooth,

252
00:11:31,268 --> 00:11:33,067
which saved us a lot of time.

253
00:11:34,187 --> 00:11:36,187
You were the only other person aware

254
00:11:36,748 --> 00:11:38,787
of Chancellor Xu's collusion with Wutuo.

255
00:11:40,187 --> 00:11:41,988
Since the assassins were Wutuo agents,

256
00:11:42,947 --> 00:11:44,787
naturally, we suspected Chancellor Xu.

257
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:47,988
In Jiyang and Rundu,

258
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:50,587
you defied Chancellor Xu's orders

259
00:11:50,988 --> 00:11:52,787
and defended against Wutuo forces

260
00:11:53,148 --> 00:11:54,187
with us.

261
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:57,028
As Chancellor Xu's disciple,

262
00:11:57,787 --> 00:11:59,108
why did you

263
00:11:59,707 --> 00:12:00,707
do that?

264
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:04,547
You know well, Commander Xiao,

265
00:12:04,868 --> 00:12:06,988
officials often act against their will.

266
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:10,108
Different stances
dictate different actions.

267
00:12:10,587 --> 00:12:11,748
But everything I've done

268
00:12:12,228 --> 00:12:13,348
follows the natural course.

269
00:12:13,787 --> 00:12:16,907
I will never
cross the ethical boundaries.

270
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:19,028
I believe that

271
00:12:19,827 --> 00:12:20,787
you have principles.

272
00:12:21,868 --> 00:12:23,028
But above those principles,

273
00:12:23,547 --> 00:12:24,988
right and wrong exist.

274
00:12:25,427 --> 00:12:26,388
I hope you won't

275
00:12:26,668 --> 00:12:28,707
have to face so many helpless situations

276
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:29,988
or feel powerless.

277
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:36,068
Thank you
for your kindness and blessings.

278
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:42,388
I'll take my leave now.

279
00:12:42,988 --> 00:12:43,828
Farewell.

280
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:56,108
I hope you don't blame me

281
00:12:56,547 --> 00:12:58,468
for not telling you those earlier.

282
00:12:59,907 --> 00:13:00,747
Of course not.

283
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:03,067
But Commander,

284
00:13:03,628 --> 00:13:05,547
Mr. Chu isn't truly evil.

285
00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:09,028
Perhaps, we could work with him one day.

286
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:22,028
She's just a masked impostor,

287
00:13:22,787 --> 00:13:25,228
hiding behind others' prestige.

288
00:13:26,268 --> 00:13:28,388
Yet they praise her false heroism

289
00:13:28,748 --> 00:13:30,547
for lifting Rundu's siege.

290
00:13:31,108 --> 00:13:34,348
I am the true General Feihong.

291
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:37,468
That's me.

292
00:13:46,748 --> 00:13:48,108
My dear sister.

293
00:13:49,547 --> 00:13:52,468
The soul-calming lantern
in Yuhua Temple couldn't suppress you.

294
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:56,067
The trap in Rundu couldn't kill you.

295
00:13:57,988 --> 00:13:59,587
You are truly

296
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:02,628
relentless as a lingering ghost.

297
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:07,028
(General He.)

298
00:14:07,988 --> 00:14:10,508
Mr. Maningbu sent you a message.

299
00:14:10,787 --> 00:14:13,947
Wutuo sincerely seeks cooperation.

300
00:14:14,348 --> 00:14:16,108
We agreed

301
00:14:16,307 --> 00:14:18,907
to help you kill the seven warriors

302
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:21,868
in exchange for Rundu.

303
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:23,468
But

304
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:26,707
where did that fake
General Feihong come from?

305
00:14:27,187 --> 00:14:30,468
And why was General Fengyun in Rundu?

306
00:14:30,907 --> 00:14:31,988
The Rundu battle

307
00:14:32,468 --> 00:14:34,947
cost Wutuo significant forces.

308
00:14:35,547 --> 00:14:36,587
And in Jiyang,

309
00:14:36,947 --> 00:14:38,827
those two people ruined

310
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:40,748
Wutuo's plan.

311
00:14:41,307 --> 00:14:42,587
Could it be

312
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,587
that Chancellor Xu changed strategies?

313
00:14:46,108 --> 00:14:50,108
Have you reconciled
and colluded with Xiao Jue

314
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:52,947
to fool Mr. Maningbu

315
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:54,427
and mock Wutuo?

316
00:14:58,427 --> 00:14:59,267
This time,

317
00:15:00,028 --> 00:15:01,827
I was truly outplayed.

318
00:15:04,427 --> 00:15:05,267
However,

319
00:15:05,587 --> 00:15:07,148
I genuinely wish

320
00:15:07,228 --> 00:15:08,988
to cooperate with Mr. Maningbu.

321
00:15:10,348 --> 00:15:11,907
Please convey

322
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:16,228
my deepest apologies to Mr. Maningbu.

323
00:15:17,187 --> 00:15:19,907
Since you put it this way,

324
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:22,388
we naturally believe you.

325
00:15:22,748 --> 00:15:26,508
But Wutuo has suffered huge losses.

326
00:15:26,748 --> 00:15:27,588
General He.

327
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:28,988
When you meet Chancellor Xu,

328
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:30,988
please tell him

329
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:34,388
that Wutuo won't
accept such humiliation.

330
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:39,707
We expect Chancellor Xu
to provide a reasonable explanation.

331
00:15:51,707 --> 00:15:52,547
Chancellor.

332
00:15:52,947 --> 00:15:55,628
His Majesty has allowed Xiao Jue
to return and report

333
00:15:56,028 --> 00:15:57,228
on the Rundu Battle.

334
00:15:57,827 --> 00:16:00,067
He knew I wanted to kill him in Rundu.

335
00:16:00,187 --> 00:16:01,628
Now he's coming back for revenge.

336
00:16:02,268 --> 00:16:04,148
And the Mingshui Battle, Chancellor.

337
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:06,427
They will never let this go.

338
00:16:06,907 --> 00:16:07,747
Chancellor.

339
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:09,028
Please help me.

340
00:16:09,988 --> 00:16:11,268
Were you trying

341
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:14,187
to kill Xiao Jue in the Rundu battle?

342
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,707
At this point,

343
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:22,268
are you still hiding the truth?

344
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:28,067
Who is that masked
young general in Rundu?

345
00:16:29,108 --> 00:16:30,307
Can anyone just

346
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:33,547
impersonate General Feihong at will?

347
00:16:34,587 --> 00:16:35,508
He Rufei.

348
00:16:35,748 --> 00:16:38,787
How dare you keep me in the dark

349
00:16:39,108 --> 00:16:40,348
about this!

350
00:16:41,748 --> 00:16:42,588
I apologize.

351
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:44,388
Please forgive me.

352
00:16:45,108 --> 00:16:45,948
Chancellor.

353
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:48,388
I wasn't sure
whether my sister was alive.

354
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:50,748
That's why I used
the Rundu Battle as bait.

355
00:16:50,748 --> 00:16:53,067
I planned to kill her in Rundu
even if she was alive.

356
00:16:53,468 --> 00:16:54,388
But I didn't expect

357
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:56,468
that she would be so hard to kill.

358
00:16:56,587 --> 00:16:57,587
Hard to kill?

359
00:16:58,148 --> 00:17:00,508
Had you disclosed this earlier,

360
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,627
you wouldn't be
kneeling before me in disgrace.

361
00:17:05,787 --> 00:17:06,948
You barely won

362
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:09,147
the Huayuan Battle,

363
00:17:09,268 --> 00:17:10,708
losing seven top warriors.

364
00:17:11,587 --> 00:17:14,948
Someone disguised
as General Feihong in Rundu

365
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:17,228
to intimidate the Wutuo Army,

366
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:18,827
while the real General Feihong

367
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:21,067
failed to provide timely reinforcement.

368
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:23,468
His Majesty has heard about all this.

369
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:29,067
Both Huayuan and Rundu battles

370
00:17:29,268 --> 00:17:31,827
bear a striking resemblance
to Mingshui Battle.

371
00:17:31,988 --> 00:17:34,147
People will inevitably draw connections.

372
00:17:35,028 --> 00:17:38,107
Xiao Jue and your sister
will pursue this relentlessly.

373
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,908
His Majesty will also order
a full investigation.

374
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:45,268
They might even reopen
the Mingshui Battle investigation.

375
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:50,668
He Rufei.

376
00:17:51,107 --> 00:17:53,067
Your concealment

377
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:55,748
has put us both in deep trouble.

378
00:17:56,028 --> 00:17:58,948
The Wutuo people
won't let us off, either.

379
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:02,308
That's right.

380
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:03,268
Chancellor.

381
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:04,787
You're right.

382
00:18:05,428 --> 00:18:06,587
Rest assured, Chancellor.

383
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:10,108
I will never
keep anything from you again.

384
00:18:11,387 --> 00:18:13,908
Chancellor, please get me out of this.

385
00:18:14,307 --> 00:18:16,668
Chancellor, please save me this time.

386
00:18:16,747 --> 00:18:17,587
Please!

387
00:18:17,587 --> 00:18:18,748
No more secrets ever again.

388
00:18:19,948 --> 00:18:22,827
Good that you've come
to this realization.

389
00:18:23,587 --> 00:18:28,468
Absolute transparency
is the key to our collaboration.

390
00:18:29,347 --> 00:18:30,187
That's enough.

391
00:18:30,468 --> 00:18:31,468
I will find a way

392
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:33,787
to pacify the Wutuo people.

393
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:35,587
And I will emphasize

394
00:18:36,587 --> 00:18:37,988
your contributions

395
00:18:39,147 --> 00:18:40,508
to His Majesty,

396
00:18:40,748 --> 00:18:41,708
while shifting blame

397
00:18:42,347 --> 00:18:44,268
onto the enemies.

398
00:18:44,827 --> 00:18:46,988
As for Xiao Jue and your sister,

399
00:18:47,468 --> 00:18:49,107
if my predictions hold,

400
00:18:50,107 --> 00:18:52,147
they're planning to use the scandal

401
00:18:52,188 --> 00:18:54,028
of your family swapping your identities

402
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:55,347
as leverage.

403
00:18:56,028 --> 00:18:58,387
Now that they had finally
found a chance,

404
00:18:58,627 --> 00:19:00,587
they requested permission to return.

405
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:03,268
They'll use you to get what they want.

406
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:08,908
We can't

407
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:12,107
let them come back alive.

408
00:19:13,627 --> 00:19:14,467
Commander Li.

409
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:15,827
Open this letter

410
00:19:16,228 --> 00:19:17,428
after we leave.

411
00:19:22,147 --> 00:19:26,187
General Fengyun, Attendant Wu'an,
General Yan. Safe travels.

412
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:27,508
I'll drink with you

413
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,748
in the capital

414
00:19:29,347 --> 00:19:30,708
after the Mid-Autumn Festival.

415
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,348
Wait.

416
00:19:42,188 --> 00:19:43,787
Attendant Wu'an, a moment please.

417
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:49,828
Attendant Wu'an.

418
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,107
We will never

419
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:53,147
forget what you said to us.

420
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:54,988
We'll do our best to live on.

421
00:19:55,908 --> 00:19:58,188
We've set up a textile workshop,

422
00:19:58,587 --> 00:20:00,107
making a living on our own.

423
00:20:01,347 --> 00:20:03,187
Though we can't fight enemies as you do,

424
00:20:03,507 --> 00:20:05,587
we can make minor contributions.

425
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:08,627
We'll bring Rundu's
brocade weaving to greater heights

426
00:20:09,028 --> 00:20:10,028
across the entire Wei.

427
00:20:11,107 --> 00:20:12,352
No job is superior or inferior.

428
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:14,268
Everything improves

429
00:20:14,468 --> 00:20:16,028
through gradual efforts.

430
00:20:16,668 --> 00:20:17,708
Change will come

431
00:20:17,948 --> 00:20:19,147
as long as you take action.

432
00:20:19,827 --> 00:20:20,668
Then I'll wait

433
00:20:20,948 --> 00:20:22,347
to see Rundu's brocade

434
00:20:22,508 --> 00:20:23,547
known throughout Wei.

435
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:25,147
Alright.

436
00:20:25,748 --> 00:20:27,387
You are indeed popular.

437
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:29,307
But I don't envy you at all.

438
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:31,068
I'm leaving, He Yan.

439
00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:33,188
My wife is waiting at home.

440
00:20:33,748 --> 00:20:34,668
Got it.

441
00:20:35,228 --> 00:20:36,508
Only you have a wife, huh?

442
00:20:37,587 --> 00:20:39,268
Attendant Wu'an inspires people

443
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:41,428
with the resilience he possesses.

444
00:20:43,348 --> 00:20:46,187
Many people may
show consideration for others,

445
00:20:46,468 --> 00:20:47,308
but

446
00:20:47,508 --> 00:20:48,748
those who would

447
00:20:49,268 --> 00:20:50,147
sacrifice themselves

448
00:20:51,188 --> 00:20:53,107
for other people at critical moments

449
00:20:53,908 --> 00:20:55,147
are exceedingly rare.

450
00:20:55,867 --> 00:20:57,107
(He truly resembles)

451
00:20:57,107 --> 00:20:58,268
(General Feihong back then.)

452
00:21:11,107 --> 00:21:11,948
Your Majesty.

453
00:21:12,668 --> 00:21:13,748
During the Rundu Battle,

454
00:21:13,988 --> 00:21:16,667
He Yan led the locals
in unwavering defense,

455
00:21:16,867 --> 00:21:19,308
while Xiao Jue
offered timely reinforcements.

456
00:21:19,587 --> 00:21:20,908
Together, they defended Rundu

457
00:21:21,188 --> 00:21:22,307
against the Wutuo army.

458
00:21:22,508 --> 00:21:23,908
It was a great contribution.

459
00:21:24,468 --> 00:21:26,188
I'm well aware of Xiao Jue's

460
00:21:26,508 --> 00:21:27,428
military prowess.

461
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:28,988
But He Yan

462
00:21:29,428 --> 00:21:30,827
used to be relatively unknown,

463
00:21:31,107 --> 00:21:33,787
but recently
he's been showing his talent.

464
00:21:34,748 --> 00:21:35,827
He's a real talent.

465
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:37,387
Your Majesty.

466
00:21:37,668 --> 00:21:38,508
In my humble opinion,

467
00:21:39,028 --> 00:21:39,868
Attendant Wu'an

468
00:21:40,268 --> 00:21:41,387
has the potential

469
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:42,508
to be a general.

470
00:21:43,028 --> 00:21:44,067
Most remarkably,

471
00:21:44,268 --> 00:21:46,347
his heart beats with patriotic bravery

472
00:21:46,508 --> 00:21:47,988
and unyielding resolve.

473
00:21:50,188 --> 00:21:51,908
On the contrary, He Rufei,

474
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,228
once considered capable,

475
00:21:54,787 --> 00:21:57,188
has proven utterly incompetent.

476
00:21:57,787 --> 00:21:58,668
He lost

477
00:21:59,307 --> 00:22:01,787
seven of our top warriors in Huayuan.

478
00:22:03,587 --> 00:22:04,427
Your Majesty.

479
00:22:04,787 --> 00:22:05,627
The Huayuan Battle

480
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:07,347
was a costly victory.

481
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,667
But our enemies are well-equipped,

482
00:22:09,948 --> 00:22:11,468
and they far outnumber us.

483
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:12,987
I believe

484
00:22:13,347 --> 00:22:14,187
that General He

485
00:22:15,307 --> 00:22:16,827
may have done his utmost.

486
00:22:18,908 --> 00:22:20,028
"May have?"

487
00:22:26,787 --> 00:22:27,627
Enough.

488
00:22:28,028 --> 00:22:28,868
Forget about them.

489
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:30,707
Mr. Chu,

490
00:22:31,547 --> 00:22:33,627
you put yourself at risk
and defended Rundu.

491
00:22:34,147 --> 00:22:35,428
It deserves recognition.

492
00:22:36,067 --> 00:22:37,228
Why didn't you bring it up?

493
00:22:37,748 --> 00:22:39,827
My minor contributions
aren't worth mentioning.

494
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,387
Last time, you asked for rewards.

495
00:22:45,787 --> 00:22:48,188
Why are you declining them now?

496
00:22:48,748 --> 00:22:50,428
Your previous rewards

497
00:22:50,627 --> 00:22:52,788
allowed me to take action in Rundu.

498
00:22:53,228 --> 00:22:55,188
I merely wanted to serve Your Majesty.

499
00:22:55,468 --> 00:22:57,147
Thus, I need no further rewards.

500
00:22:58,387 --> 00:23:00,547
Xiao Jue and Chancellor Xu
don't get along.

501
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:03,067
As Chancellor Xu's prized disciple,

502
00:23:03,668 --> 00:23:05,307
it's commendable that you're speaking

503
00:23:06,188 --> 00:23:07,347
in favor of Xiao Jue.

504
00:23:09,028 --> 00:23:11,508
Ministers may differ politically,

505
00:23:12,188 --> 00:23:14,028
but we stand united in loyalty

506
00:23:14,867 --> 00:23:16,147
to Your Majesty.

507
00:23:19,428 --> 00:23:20,468
Pass on my decree.

508
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:23,228
Director Chu Zhao

509
00:23:24,067 --> 00:23:25,107
of the Ministry of War

510
00:23:25,547 --> 00:23:28,708
is a true pillar of Wei,
having shouldered my burdens repeatedly.

511
00:23:29,147 --> 00:23:29,987
I hereby

512
00:23:30,468 --> 00:23:31,787
appoint Chu Zhao

513
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,948
as Fourth-Rank Vice Minister of War.

514
00:23:35,228 --> 00:23:36,188
Yes, Your Majesty.

515
00:23:39,827 --> 00:23:42,067
I humbly thank Your Majesty.

516
00:23:55,587 --> 00:23:58,547
Master, I went to Rundu on my own

517
00:23:58,827 --> 00:24:01,028
against your instructions.
Please forgive me.

518
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:15,147
His Majesty thinks highly of you
and has given you

519
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:17,587
another promotion.

520
00:24:19,428 --> 00:24:21,268
You don't need to apologize.

521
00:24:25,668 --> 00:24:26,547
You flatter me.

522
00:24:27,107 --> 00:24:27,947
I'm ashamed.

523
00:24:28,387 --> 00:24:32,307
You've risen in such a short time,

524
00:24:32,908 --> 00:24:37,268
soon to become
His Majesty's right-hand man

525
00:24:37,347 --> 00:24:39,627
and a pillar of Wei.

526
00:24:40,988 --> 00:24:41,988
You are truly

527
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:44,988
my most accomplished disciple.

528
00:24:46,547 --> 00:24:47,787
I had no choice.

529
00:24:48,428 --> 00:24:49,948
The circumstances forced my hand.

530
00:24:55,347 --> 00:24:56,827
Xiao Jue and He Yan

531
00:24:56,908 --> 00:24:59,428
are about to return for rewards.

532
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,988
Is this what you mean by "no choice"?

533
00:25:04,268 --> 00:25:06,028
They kept distinguishing themselves.

534
00:25:06,428 --> 00:25:07,787
I grew anxious, thinking

535
00:25:07,988 --> 00:25:09,508
that I couldn't just let them be.

536
00:25:09,867 --> 00:25:12,108
So I rushed to Rundu
without seeking permission.

537
00:25:17,547 --> 00:25:18,988
The entire court knows

538
00:25:19,387 --> 00:25:20,468
that I'm your disciple.

539
00:25:21,307 --> 00:25:23,107
His Majesty may have promoted me,

540
00:25:23,668 --> 00:25:24,508
but in reality,

541
00:25:25,147 --> 00:25:26,387
he was honoring you.

542
00:25:27,508 --> 00:25:28,348
Moreover,

543
00:25:28,748 --> 00:25:29,588
the higher I climb,

544
00:25:30,307 --> 00:25:32,387
the more useful I can be to you.

545
00:25:38,627 --> 00:25:41,468
Since you wish to share my burdens,

546
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:43,547
you should know

547
00:25:43,988 --> 00:25:47,147
my greatest concern at hand

548
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:49,147
is He Rufei.

549
00:25:49,827 --> 00:25:52,347
You just returned from court.

550
00:25:52,787 --> 00:25:53,988
What is His Majesty

551
00:25:54,908 --> 00:25:56,547
thinking about him?

552
00:25:57,147 --> 00:25:58,627
His Majesty is indeed displeased

553
00:25:58,748 --> 00:26:01,227
with He Rufei's performance at Huayuan.

554
00:26:01,547 --> 00:26:03,508
But I've pleaded his case

555
00:26:03,587 --> 00:26:04,508
by explaining that

556
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,748
our enemies outnumbered us,

557
00:26:07,347 --> 00:26:09,948
and He Rufei may have done his best.

558
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:15,147
Do you truly believe that?

559
00:26:19,067 --> 00:26:19,908
In my opinion,

560
00:26:20,307 --> 00:26:22,307
it's fishy that the seven warriors

561
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:23,827
died in an ambush.

562
00:26:24,387 --> 00:26:25,908
But after the Rundu Battle,

563
00:26:26,307 --> 00:26:27,428
I figured it all out.

564
00:26:28,228 --> 00:26:30,988
The Rundu Battle was a trap
He Rufei set for Xiao Jue.

565
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:33,067
He Rufei needed

566
00:26:33,428 --> 00:26:36,468
huge losses in Huayuan
to avoid reinforcing Rundu.

567
00:26:37,107 --> 00:26:38,067
That's how the trap

568
00:26:38,668 --> 00:26:39,508
would work.

569
00:26:40,468 --> 00:26:41,308
However,

570
00:26:41,827 --> 00:26:44,067
Xiao Jue summoned Yan He

571
00:26:44,387 --> 00:26:45,627
and defended Rundu.

572
00:26:46,668 --> 00:26:47,508
He Rufei

573
00:26:47,948 --> 00:26:49,748
miscalculated and lost.

574
00:26:52,468 --> 00:26:53,308
Alright.

575
00:26:53,867 --> 00:26:54,908
It seems

576
00:26:55,468 --> 00:26:56,988
that you have indeed

577
00:26:57,268 --> 00:26:58,988
exerted great effort.

578
00:27:03,107 --> 00:27:04,307
I heard Zilan came.

579
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:05,827
I knew he'd be here.

580
00:27:07,188 --> 00:27:08,508
Why haven't you come to see me?

581
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:10,268
Alright.

582
00:27:11,387 --> 00:27:12,867
My business here concludes.

583
00:27:13,908 --> 00:27:15,587
Pingting keeps mentioning you.

584
00:27:16,107 --> 00:27:16,948
Keep her company.

585
00:27:18,268 --> 00:27:20,787
You must be busy, Master.
Don't let me disrupt you.

586
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:26,627
Sorry.

587
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:27,908
I have things

588
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:29,067
to attend to today.

589
00:27:30,188 --> 00:27:31,587
What about tomorrow?

590
00:27:31,748 --> 00:27:32,827
I have other jobs.

591
00:27:33,228 --> 00:27:34,068
The day after?

592
00:27:35,228 --> 00:27:36,188
And beyond?

593
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,872
(Chu Mansion)

594
00:27:44,307 --> 00:27:46,708
- Is the banquet ready?
- All set.

595
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,627
Don't make any mistakes.

596
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:49,467
Rest assured.

597
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:50,428
It's an important day.

598
00:27:50,948 --> 00:27:53,347
- We must please him.
- Mr. Chu.

599
00:27:53,347 --> 00:27:54,347
Rest assured.

600
00:28:01,987 --> 00:28:02,827
Zilan.

601
00:28:02,827 --> 00:28:04,028
You're finally back.

602
00:28:04,508 --> 00:28:06,107
We've been waiting

603
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:07,748
to welcome you with a feast.

604
00:28:08,347 --> 00:28:09,187
That's right.

605
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:10,708
Sorry I've kept you waiting.

606
00:28:11,307 --> 00:28:12,387
I went to report

607
00:28:12,547 --> 00:28:13,587
to His Majesty first

608
00:28:14,547 --> 00:28:16,147
and paid respects to my master.

609
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:17,868
That's why I'm late.

610
00:28:18,228 --> 00:28:19,068
It's alright.

611
00:28:20,028 --> 00:28:20,868
No problem.

612
00:28:21,347 --> 00:28:23,748
His Majesty thinks highly of you.

613
00:28:24,228 --> 00:28:26,547
Official duties take precedence.

614
00:28:30,428 --> 00:28:31,268
Yeah.

615
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,627
Focus on your work.

616
00:28:33,188 --> 00:28:35,587
Leave trivial matters
to your uncle and me.

617
00:28:36,268 --> 00:28:37,347
Let me know

618
00:28:37,627 --> 00:28:38,827
if you need anything.

619
00:28:39,268 --> 00:28:41,787
We'll arrange everything.

620
00:28:42,028 --> 00:28:43,147
Actually, there is

621
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:44,147
nothing

622
00:28:44,147 --> 00:28:44,987
I need.

623
00:28:45,587 --> 00:28:47,028
But one thing has weighed on me

624
00:28:47,867 --> 00:28:48,787
for years.

625
00:28:55,147 --> 00:28:56,307
What's troubling you?

626
00:28:57,147 --> 00:28:58,147
Tell us.

627
00:29:00,387 --> 00:29:01,827
Don't you want your

628
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:02,827
scandalous mother,

629
00:29:03,268 --> 00:29:04,547
who gave birth unwed,

630
00:29:04,748 --> 00:29:06,107
to enter the Chu ancestral hall?

631
00:29:06,748 --> 00:29:08,428
Then rise

632
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:10,107
to prominence quickly.

633
00:29:12,908 --> 00:29:14,147
My deepest wish

634
00:29:15,428 --> 00:29:16,428
is only for my mother

635
00:29:17,867 --> 00:29:19,188
to find eternal peace.

636
00:29:30,188 --> 00:29:31,668
So, you still don't think

637
00:29:31,947 --> 00:29:32,787
my mother...

638
00:29:32,787 --> 00:29:33,627
You got us wrong.

639
00:29:33,787 --> 00:29:34,627
You got us wrong.

640
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:37,867
My sister was virtuous and dignified.

641
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:39,867
She deserves to be enshrined

642
00:29:40,067 --> 00:29:41,587
in the ancestral hall.

643
00:29:45,268 --> 00:29:46,108
Zilan,

644
00:29:47,468 --> 00:29:48,708
your mother...

645
00:29:51,908 --> 00:29:53,228
Your aunt was

646
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:55,547
not good with words.

647
00:29:56,188 --> 00:29:57,668
Please don't take

648
00:29:57,867 --> 00:30:00,107
her gibberish to heart.

649
00:30:02,307 --> 00:30:04,508
I was stupid and often misspoke.

650
00:30:05,067 --> 00:30:06,708
P-Please forgive me.

651
00:30:09,547 --> 00:30:10,387
In that case,

652
00:30:11,787 --> 00:30:12,827
I truly appreciate it.

653
00:30:13,508 --> 00:30:14,348
Our pleasure.

654
00:30:14,787 --> 00:30:15,627
Our pleasure.

655
00:30:26,803 --> 00:30:28,928
(Late Mother, Chu Mingfang)

656
00:30:29,508 --> 00:30:30,348
Mother,

657
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:32,428
I'm bringing you home.

658
00:30:34,347 --> 00:30:35,468
From now on,

659
00:30:36,228 --> 00:30:37,708
no one will speak ill of you

660
00:30:38,908 --> 00:30:39,748
ever again.

661
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:48,268
My dear, poor sister.

662
00:30:49,107 --> 00:30:50,908
I've wronged you.

663
00:30:51,067 --> 00:30:52,028
But rest assured.

664
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:53,147
From now on,

665
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:54,188
I won't let you

666
00:30:54,307 --> 00:30:55,988
suffer any humiliation again.

667
00:31:05,268 --> 00:31:07,347
You have acknowledged your mistakes.

668
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,228
Mother's spirit must find this

669
00:31:12,228 --> 00:31:13,268
comforting.

670
00:31:14,668 --> 00:31:15,547
All these years,

671
00:31:15,988 --> 00:31:17,228
only I've been coming

672
00:31:17,468 --> 00:31:18,908
to visit my mother.

673
00:31:20,948 --> 00:31:22,748
In fact, she always enjoyed company.

674
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:25,387
If you don't mind it,

675
00:31:26,228 --> 00:31:27,307
please come more often

676
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:29,708
and offer my mother some incense.

677
00:31:31,268 --> 00:31:32,147
Should we come often?

678
00:31:32,547 --> 00:31:33,387
Silence.

679
00:31:36,067 --> 00:31:36,907
Absolutely.

680
00:31:37,587 --> 00:31:38,427
Absolutely.

681
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:40,708
We will.
