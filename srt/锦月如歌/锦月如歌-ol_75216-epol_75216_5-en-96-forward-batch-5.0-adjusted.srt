=Legend of The Female General=

22
00:01:46,832 --> 00:01:48,080
They're crossing the line,

23
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,000
putting loaches in my shoes.

24
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:56,880
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,808
It was an accident.

26
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,912
These candies got dirty.

27
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,239
Put them back.

28
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,199
Don't eat those.

29
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,176
Should I buy you new ones?

30
00:02:16,176 --> 00:02:17,079
No need. Go to class.

31
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:28,048
=Episode 5=

32
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,400
You dug so much
into his past, but to no avail?

33
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,439
That's right.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,960
Everything matches his military records.

35
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:39,840
Maybe He Yan really has nothing to do
with He Rufei and Xu Jingfu.

36
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,520
This only proves

37
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,000
those covering for him
are remarkably capable.

38
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,992
Covering for him?

39
00:02:46,992 --> 00:02:48,880
Commander, have you
discovered something?

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,560
An unexpected lead.

41
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,919
Have people keep looking.

42
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:55,759
Yes.

43
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,439
And what's going on
with the delay in provisions?

44
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,000
Yezhou Magistrate Sun Xiangfu

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,336
claims the harvest is poor,

46
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,000
the farmers are owed payments,

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,040
and the grain reserves
are critically low.

48
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,759
So he can't spare us any grain.

49
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:13,815
Absolute nonsense.

50
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:15,614
It's not like there were

51
00:03:15,975 --> 00:03:17,255
any natural disasters.

52
00:03:22,815 --> 00:03:23,815
There were none.

53
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,654
But man-made troubles exist.

54
00:03:26,214 --> 00:03:28,214
I bet Xu Jingfu told him to oppose you.

55
00:03:32,975 --> 00:03:34,975
Xu Jingfu got me transferred to Yezhou,

56
00:03:35,472 --> 00:03:36,654
away from the capital,

57
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,295
without any chance to turn the tide.

58
00:03:39,815 --> 00:03:40,815
He never imagined

59
00:03:41,295 --> 00:03:43,734
that you had already chosen
to bide your time here.

60
00:03:44,054 --> 00:03:44,944
But now that

61
00:03:44,944 --> 00:03:46,416
you've trained these misfits

62
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,856
into capable soldiers,

63
00:03:47,975 --> 00:03:48,815
he's rushing

64
00:03:49,454 --> 00:03:50,734
to tamper with our provisions.

65
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,215
That's right.

66
00:03:53,095 --> 00:03:54,295
The new recruits lack cohesion.

67
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,336
If provisions run short

68
00:03:57,015 --> 00:03:58,128
in times of good harvests

69
00:03:58,734 --> 00:04:00,894
and rumors of embezzlement surface,

70
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:02,375
the new recruits will

71
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:04,734
lose their trust in me.

72
00:04:05,575 --> 00:04:06,575
What should we do?

73
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,334
The remaining provisions
can last a bit longer.

74
00:04:10,054 --> 00:04:14,576
After the contest of capturing flags,
I'll visit Sun Xiangfu in person

75
00:04:15,894 --> 00:04:16,734
and find out

76
00:04:17,734 --> 00:04:19,535
what kind of pawn

77
00:04:20,214 --> 00:04:21,935
Xu Jingfu had planted in Yezhou.

78
00:04:38,774 --> 00:04:39,614
(He Yan,)

79
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:41,854
(those closest to you)

80
00:04:42,774 --> 00:04:43,614
(despised you,)

81
00:04:44,015 --> 00:04:44,855
(abandoned you,)

82
00:04:45,214 --> 00:04:46,054
(and killed you.)

83
00:04:47,815 --> 00:04:49,695
(Since you've come back
with a new identity,)

84
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:51,575
(from now on,)

85
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,175
(your life)

86
00:04:54,015 --> 00:04:55,854
(will be solely in your hands.)

87
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:18,174
Mr. He.

88
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,720
Your lanterns are hideous.

89
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,495
What matters is the sincerity.

90
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,335
Mr. Cheng.

91
00:05:29,615 --> 00:05:30,495
Isn't your lantern

92
00:05:31,015 --> 00:05:31,974
way too huge?

93
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:33,575
This lantern

94
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:35,894
is not just for my ancestors.

95
00:05:36,575 --> 00:05:37,854
It's also for Huaijin.

96
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,055
So I made it bigger than usual.

97
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,935
With both families together,

98
00:05:42,214 --> 00:05:43,054
it's livelier

99
00:05:43,294 --> 00:05:44,134
and less lonely.

100
00:05:45,175 --> 00:05:46,015
My grand-aunt

101
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:47,414
feared loneliness most.

102
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:49,894
Madam Xiao

103
00:05:50,854 --> 00:05:51,894
also passed away?

104
00:05:52,695 --> 00:05:53,535
Yeah.

105
00:05:53,974 --> 00:05:55,934
She and my great-uncle
were a loving couple.

106
00:05:57,015 --> 00:05:58,175
After my great-uncle died,

107
00:05:58,735 --> 00:05:59,894
my great-aunt was devastated.

108
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:01,415
After Huaijin

109
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:03,575
escorted my great-uncle's coffin home,

110
00:06:04,175 --> 00:06:05,135
she took her own life.

111
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:14,294
Huaijin is also quite lonely.

112
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,215
My family,

113
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,415
including my mother,

114
00:06:17,814 --> 00:06:19,494
and friends acquainted
with the Xiao family

115
00:06:20,055 --> 00:06:21,015
don't really like him.

116
00:06:22,295 --> 00:06:23,975
They prefer my eldest uncle,

117
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,534
Huaijin's older brother,

118
00:06:25,774 --> 00:06:26,614
Xiao Jing.

119
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:28,656
Why?

120
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:30,512
Aren't they both members
of The Xiao family?

121
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,375
The Xiao family comes from
a long military lineage.

122
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:35,495
One child must join the army.

123
00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:37,815
Xiao Jing is more of a scholar

124
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:39,367
than a military man.

125
00:06:39,887 --> 00:06:41,048
So Huaijin joined the army

126
00:06:41,728 --> 00:06:42,608
for his elder brother

127
00:06:42,928 --> 00:06:44,127
and the entire family.

128
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:48,888
He left at an early age
and rarely visited home.

129
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:51,088
So, he's become quite aloof.

130
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,567
He's distant even with his own family,

131
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:54,687
let alone relatives like us.

132
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:56,248
Even his mother

133
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:58,048
doesn't feel bonded with him.

134
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:00,047
Makes sense.

135
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:03,248
They're like strangers
after years apart.

136
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:05,367
It leads to prejudice.

137
00:07:12,408 --> 00:07:13,680
Mr. He, it's late.

138
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,688
I should head back.

139
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:16,007
Rest early.

140
00:07:57,408 --> 00:07:58,408
In times of hardship,

141
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,304
take a piece of candy.

142
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:02,247
Let its sweetness

143
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:03,127
comfort you.

144
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,048
Such little sweetness

145
00:08:05,048 --> 00:08:06,928
can attenuate the bitterness of life.

146
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:39,376
Premium Osmanthus wine.

147
00:08:39,808 --> 00:08:42,607
I hear noblewomen
in the capital adore this.

148
00:08:54,544 --> 00:08:55,967
May the deceased

149
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:57,008
witness my devotion

150
00:08:57,048 --> 00:08:58,408
in folding these lanterns

151
00:08:58,408 --> 00:09:00,288
and bless my wishes.

152
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:04,967
Disturbing the deceased

153
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:07,536
doesn't make you ashamed at all.

154
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:08,848
Leave mortal affairs

155
00:09:09,768 --> 00:09:11,056
to be handled by the living.

156
00:09:15,528 --> 00:09:16,967
How do you know

157
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:18,447
I'm not speaking

158
00:09:18,447 --> 00:09:19,760
the wishes of the deceased?

159
00:09:20,704 --> 00:09:21,767
The regrets of the dead

160
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:23,487
must be redeemed by the living.

161
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,807
This is my promise to them.

162
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:31,927
Want to fold some?

163
00:09:34,087 --> 00:09:35,216
I'll share some with you

164
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:37,487
to repay you for saving me back then.

165
00:09:41,168 --> 00:09:42,008
No need.

166
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:50,160
This one

167
00:09:50,687 --> 00:09:52,687
carries blessings
to those heroes who died

168
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:54,408
defending our land and people,

169
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,687
and their loved ones.

170
00:09:57,487 --> 00:09:58,967
Though I don't know your names,

171
00:09:59,607 --> 00:10:00,727
these blessings

172
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:02,248
come from my heart.

173
00:10:04,327 --> 00:10:05,167
Not bad.

174
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:07,648
Hideous.

175
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:12,967
This is called free-form one.

176
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:14,047
Perhaps

177
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:15,607
the heroes prefer it this way.

178
00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:23,648
You mock my lanterns,

179
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:24,768
but you won't make one.

180
00:10:25,008 --> 00:10:26,567
All talk, no action.

181
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:27,768
So picky.

182
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:49,807
What's the fuss?

183
00:10:50,487 --> 00:10:52,128
I touched your hand, so what?

184
00:10:53,888 --> 00:10:56,128

I wonder if the deceased

223
00:13:48,535 --> 00:13:49,934
shares this moonlight

224
00:13:50,768 --> 00:13:52,295
with us, the living?

225
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:54,174
Yes, they do.

226
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:30,854
New recruits, listen up!

227
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,495
Red flags are placed

228
00:14:32,974 --> 00:14:34,672
throughout Mount Baiyue.

229
00:14:34,672 --> 00:14:36,096
There are 15 in total.

230
00:14:36,734 --> 00:14:37,760
This competition

231
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,816
lasts until sunset.

232
00:14:39,535 --> 00:14:42,055
The team returning
with the most red flags

233
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,255
shall be the winner.

234
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:46,615
Remember. Don't cross the mountains.

235
00:14:47,175 --> 00:14:48,255
Don't take lives.

236
00:14:48,694 --> 00:14:49,534
Violators will face

237
00:14:49,694 --> 00:14:50,655
military discipline.

238
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:51,814
- Yes.
- Yes.

239
00:14:53,214 --> 00:14:54,295
After the competition,

240
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:56,175
the most outstanding recruit

241
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,574
will join the Nine Banners Battalion.

242
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:00,454
- Really?
- Really?

243
00:15:02,574 --> 00:15:03,414
Soldiers!

244
00:15:04,015 --> 00:15:04,855
Set out.

245
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:06,694
- Yes.
- Yes.

246
00:15:15,312 --> 00:15:16,854
This is the map of Mount Baiyue?

247
00:15:17,415 --> 00:15:18,255
Where did you get it?

248
00:15:21,055 --> 00:15:22,814
I memorized the paths while patrolling

249
00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:24,624
and drew this map after I came back.

250
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:27,535
You memorized the paths

251
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:29,328
while being chased by wolves?

252
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,608
I checked the routes

253
00:15:30,608 --> 00:15:31,655
while fleeing,

254
00:15:31,655 --> 00:15:33,040
and then reviewed them later.

255
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,095
So I know this place well.

256
00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:36,415
Trust your boss.

257
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,855
Those flags

258
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:42,375
are usually placed in visible areas

259
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:44,015
near foothills and water sources.

260
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:46,574
So the nearest flag

261
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:48,400
should be

262
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,974
on this open mountainside.

263
00:15:50,854 --> 00:15:52,080
Come on, let's go for it.

264
00:15:52,814 --> 00:15:53,654
No.

265
00:15:53,734 --> 00:15:54,934
We're not going there.

266
00:15:56,112 --> 00:15:57,328
Those flags in the open

267
00:15:57,328 --> 00:15:59,248
are easy targets.

268
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:00,895
Many teams will notice them.

269
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:02,672
If we go there,

270
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:04,375
we'll be caught in chaos.

271
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:06,174
So,

272
00:16:08,432 --> 00:16:09,614
we'll head

273
00:16:10,574 --> 00:16:11,414
here.

274
00:16:11,903 --> 00:16:13,303
It's among dense woods,

275
00:16:13,783 --> 00:16:15,102
behind a cliff.

276
00:16:16,063 --> 00:16:17,342
It will be a challenge.

277
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,783
Classic carrot-and-stick tactic.

278
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:22,503
They lure us with rewards
and then slap us down.

279
00:16:23,102 --> 00:16:24,582
Of course, it's challenging.

280
00:16:25,102 --> 00:16:26,023
Or they can just hold

281
00:16:26,383 --> 00:16:27,543
a martial arts contest.

282
00:16:29,582 --> 00:16:30,422
Let's go.

283
00:16:31,903 --> 00:16:33,903
Cliffs on Mount Baiyue are dangerous.

284
00:16:34,263 --> 00:16:35,222
I doubt anyone

285
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:37,783
can take this flag.

286
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:40,702
New recruits can't.

287
00:16:41,702 --> 00:16:42,663
But veterans might

288
00:16:43,543 --> 00:16:45,822
have realized the purpose of the patrol

289
00:16:47,303 --> 00:16:49,183
and completed a thorough mapping.

290
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:52,302
Do we have

291
00:16:52,742 --> 00:16:53,742
such a talent here?

292
00:16:55,543 --> 00:16:56,383
Yeah.

293
00:16:59,383 --> 00:17:00,223
He Yan.

294
00:17:39,152 --> 00:17:40,783
It's in such a precarious position.

295
00:17:40,783 --> 00:17:42,463
Only you could get that flag, He.

296
00:17:43,143 --> 00:17:43,983
Piece of cake.

297
00:17:57,462 --> 00:17:59,142
He, you're amazing.

298
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:02,943
With only one patrol,

299
00:18:03,422 --> 00:18:04,262
He Yan

300
00:18:04,262 --> 00:18:06,263
has learned Mount Baiyue by heart.

301
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:08,103
Impressive new talent.

302
00:18:09,343 --> 00:18:11,183
But I bet on Lei Hou's team.

303
00:18:11,823 --> 00:18:12,702
Everyone

304
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:15,742
in that team is a top martial artist.

305
00:18:16,943 --> 00:18:18,583
It takes teamwork to capture flags,

306
00:18:19,343 --> 00:18:20,383
not individual heroism.

307
00:18:21,302 --> 00:18:22,742
Therefore, deployment matters

308
00:18:23,623 --> 00:18:24,742
more than muscle.

309
00:18:25,423 --> 00:18:26,663
So I still bet on

310
00:18:27,183 --> 00:18:28,023
He Yan.

311
00:18:30,823 --> 00:18:32,502
H-Hand over your flags.

312
00:18:32,702 --> 00:18:34,343
(The members of He Yan's team are)

313
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,462
(of mixed quality,)

314
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:37,392
(but each has talents.)

315
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:39,663
(If he can harness their talents)

316
00:18:39,982 --> 00:18:40,823
(through deployment,)

317
00:18:41,143 --> 00:18:41,983
(they should)

318
00:18:42,262 --> 00:18:43,502
(make quite a team.)

319
00:18:43,903 --> 00:18:44,743
Take action.

320
00:18:48,063 --> 00:18:48,903
Do you surrender?

321
00:18:48,903 --> 00:18:49,743
Y-Yeah.

322
00:18:50,183 --> 00:18:52,262
W-Where are your flags?

323
00:19:05,782 --> 00:19:06,622
Commander.

324
00:19:06,823 --> 00:19:08,583
He Yan's team
set up ambushes and snatched

325
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,223
many flags from the other teams.

326
00:19:10,623 --> 00:19:11,463
"Hold the ground,"

327
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:13,222
"stay fresh, and strike"

328
00:19:14,823 --> 00:19:15,863
"when the enemy is weak."

329
00:19:17,742 --> 00:19:18,903
Those new recruits

330
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:21,423
are being thoroughly outplayed.

331
00:19:36,302 --> 00:19:37,142
What a surprise.

332
00:19:37,462 --> 00:19:38,800
You also captured seven flags.

333
00:19:39,423 --> 00:19:40,982
That's impressive.

334
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:42,863
You flatter me.

335
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,062
Now we each hold seven flags.

336
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,728
Whoever claims
the last one in the valley

337
00:19:47,982 --> 00:19:48,943
becomes the winner.

338
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:50,982
That terrain is treacherous.

339
00:19:51,383 --> 00:19:52,742
Why don't you retreat

340
00:19:53,222 --> 00:19:54,863
with your team to secure second place?

341
00:19:57,143 --> 00:19:57,983
That may be good,

342
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,823
but I crave first place.

343
00:20:02,222 --> 00:20:04,062
Very well. We'll meet in the valley.

344
00:20:33,462 --> 00:20:35,262
Mr. Lei, this isn't much fun.

345
00:20:35,663 --> 00:20:37,502
Why don't we spice things up?

346
00:20:39,103 --> 00:20:39,943
I'm listening.

347
00:20:40,302 --> 00:20:41,142
What do you want?

348
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:42,663
A duel.

349
00:20:43,062 --> 00:20:43,902
The loser

350
00:20:44,103 --> 00:20:45,583
surrenders all his flags.

351
00:20:47,262 --> 00:20:48,863
Those guys? Are they up to it?

352
00:20:48,863 --> 00:20:49,823
No way, He.

353
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,022
We worked so hard for these.

354
00:20:53,702 --> 00:20:55,382
It's okay, don't worry.

355
00:20:56,502 --> 00:20:57,542
If we come to duels,

356
00:20:58,383 --> 00:20:59,542
I won't hold back.

357
00:21:00,022 --> 00:21:01,982
You may lose even second place.

358
00:21:03,903 --> 00:21:04,823
I don't like fighting.

359
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:07,663
But no one can take what I desire

360
00:21:08,262 --> 00:21:09,343
from me.

361
00:21:10,262 --> 00:21:11,102
Therefore,

362
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:12,462
I'll have to beat you.

363
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:57,663
He Yan trusts us with his back.

364
00:21:58,062 --> 00:22:00,103
Naturally, we'll eliminate all threats.

365
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,502
You agreed to duel.

366
00:22:01,943 --> 00:22:03,222
But you resorted to tricks?

367
00:22:03,943 --> 00:22:05,542
E-Even bandits...

368
00:22:05,943 --> 00:22:07,183
Bandits keep their word better.

369
00:22:23,823 --> 00:22:25,343
(Odd moves.)

370
00:22:46,503 --> 00:22:48,048
- Nice!
- Well done!

371
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:51,782
Remarkable, Mr. He.

372
00:22:52,262 --> 00:22:53,143
I concede.

373
00:22:54,823 --> 00:22:55,742
You honor me.

374
00:22:57,103 --> 00:22:57,943
Commander.

375
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,623
He Yan has claimed all 15 flags.

376
00:23:01,222 --> 00:23:02,262
His team has returned.

377
00:23:03,143 --> 00:23:03,983
You've lost.

378
00:23:04,336 --> 00:23:05,302
Commander,

379
00:23:05,623 --> 00:23:07,982
you're a great chess player
and talent scout.

380
00:23:09,143 --> 00:23:09,983
I humbly

381
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:11,423
admit defeat.

382
00:23:13,782 --> 00:23:15,982
(If she were truly a planted spy here,)

383
00:23:16,431 --> 00:23:18,223
(she wouldn't eagerly draw my attention)

384
00:23:18,383 --> 00:23:20,079
(by flaunting this conquest.)

385
00:23:21,343 --> 00:23:22,895
(But she is no ordinary recruit.)

386
00:23:23,742 --> 00:23:26,262
(He Yan, what's your intention?)

387
00:23:27,143 --> 00:23:27,983
Commander.

388
00:23:28,183 --> 00:23:29,222
The contest concludes.

389
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:31,143
Shall we proceed with rewards?

390
00:23:34,143 --> 00:23:34,983
No rush.

391
00:23:35,502 --> 00:23:39,383
The Mid-Autumn Festival is
in five days. Wait until then.

392
00:23:41,022 --> 00:23:43,542
Have you decided the one to be

393
00:23:44,343 --> 00:23:46,222
enrolled in the Nine Banners Battalion?

394
00:24:13,022 --> 00:24:14,982
We took first place.

395
00:24:14,982 --> 00:24:16,592
But there's no celebration?

396
00:24:17,262 --> 00:24:18,102
This is lame.

397
00:24:18,702 --> 00:24:19,903
There will be a feast.

398
00:24:19,903 --> 00:24:20,912
It's just postponed.

399
00:24:21,302 --> 00:24:22,142
Rest assured.

400
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:23,383
You'll get your banquet.

401
00:24:24,502 --> 00:24:25,943
Don't mock me.

402
00:24:25,943 --> 00:24:27,696
Aren't you craving meat?

403
00:24:28,143 --> 00:24:29,360
- Of course, we are.
- Of course, we are.

404
00:24:31,623 --> 00:24:32,463
He,

405
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:33,743
after you join

406
00:24:34,103 --> 00:24:35,583
the Nine Banners Battalion,

407
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:37,222
don't forget us.

408
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:40,183
Never would I.

409
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:47,863
(Let me ask Xiao Jue about this.)

410
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:54,423
Morning, Master.

411
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:00,423
Master.

412
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,062
I lived up to your expectations

413
00:25:02,062 --> 00:25:04,368
and won first place in the competition.

414
00:25:04,368 --> 00:25:05,742
Thanks to your guidance,

415
00:25:05,742 --> 00:25:07,782
I can join the Nine Banners Battalion.

416
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:11,312
(Great Master and Talented Disciple)
This is a flower basket I made.

417
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:12,583
These 15 flags

418
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:14,143
represent my newly earned honors.

419
00:25:14,143 --> 00:25:15,183
Please accept it

420
00:25:15,183 --> 00:25:17,143
as a token of gratitude.

421
00:25:20,462 --> 00:25:21,302
"Talented disciple"?

422
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:24,816
You really know
how to toot your own horn.

423
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:26,943
How am I tooting my own horn?

424
00:25:27,462 --> 00:25:29,702
Look, it says "Great Master" right here.

425
00:25:30,542 --> 00:25:31,382
With our bond,

426
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:33,104
once I join the battalion,

427
00:25:33,104 --> 00:25:34,102
I'll surely

428
00:25:34,222 --> 00:25:35,152
stand by you

429
00:25:35,152 --> 00:25:36,102
through thick and thin

430
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:37,143
forever.

431
00:25:39,262 --> 00:25:40,302
So eloquent.

432
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:42,143
It's a pity you're not teaching literacy

433
00:25:42,143 --> 00:25:43,623
to the troops.

434
00:25:43,623 --> 00:25:44,463
Master,

435
00:25:45,103 --> 00:25:47,062
how can you value my silver tongue

436
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:48,302
over my true capabilities?

437
00:25:48,623 --> 00:25:49,776
With abilities like mine,

438
00:25:49,776 --> 00:25:51,120
I'll become your right-hand man

439
00:25:51,262 --> 00:25:53,663
once I join the Nine Banners Battalion.

440
00:26:08,742 --> 00:26:09,582
Are you really

441
00:26:10,982 --> 00:26:12,383
so eager to join the battalion?

442
00:26:12,903 --> 00:26:13,743
Of course.

443
00:26:13,943 --> 00:26:15,024
I'm a real talent.

444
00:26:15,024 --> 00:26:17,040
It would be your loss if I didn't join

445
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,542
the Nine Banners Battalion.

446
00:26:19,623 --> 00:26:21,022
I won't let you

447
00:26:21,022 --> 00:26:22,103
suffer such a great loss

448
00:26:22,103 --> 00:26:23,423
in your life, Commander.

449
00:26:29,863 --> 00:26:30,703
Commander.

450
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:32,663
All instructors are waiting for you

451
00:26:32,663 --> 00:26:33,702
at the main tent.

452
00:26:37,622 --> 00:26:39,183
Military affairs take priority.

453
00:26:39,183 --> 00:26:40,023
Go ahead.

454
00:26:40,023 --> 00:26:41,623
We can talk anytime.

455
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:43,943
Wait.

456
00:26:46,302 --> 00:26:48,142
Take the pastries from the table.

457
00:26:57,262 --> 00:26:58,102
Thank you, Commander.

458
00:27:01,631 --> 00:27:04,976
(General Feihong's Mansion)

459
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:06,382
General.

460
00:27:06,903 --> 00:27:07,743
There is

461
00:27:08,022 --> 00:27:09,302
no conflict of interest

462
00:27:09,302 --> 00:27:10,142
between us.

463
00:27:10,782 --> 00:27:12,912
Wouldn't it be nice if we both

464
00:27:12,912 --> 00:27:13,903
served the Master?

465
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:17,982
He wasn't

466
00:27:18,383 --> 00:27:19,742
avoiding you that day.

467
00:27:20,262 --> 00:27:22,263
He's just been burdened with worries

468
00:27:22,623 --> 00:27:24,183
and has become short-tempered.

469
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:25,903
I wonder what troubles

470
00:27:26,423 --> 00:27:27,623
the Chancellor.

471
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:37,302
It's Xiao Jue.

472
00:27:37,982 --> 00:27:39,543
He's causing trouble even in Yezhou.

473
00:27:39,543 --> 00:27:41,903
He is drawing attention
with the training

474
00:27:41,903 --> 00:27:43,343
and making outrageous demands

475
00:27:43,343 --> 00:27:45,143
to Yezhou Magistrate Sun Xiangfu

476
00:27:45,143 --> 00:27:46,183
for provisions and funds.

477
00:27:46,823 --> 00:27:48,742
Sun Xiangfu is running short on those,

478
00:27:48,742 --> 00:27:50,183
but Xiao Jue refuses to back down.

479
00:27:50,183 --> 00:27:52,343
They're at an impasse.

480
00:27:53,302 --> 00:27:54,583
As the Chancellor's disciple,

481
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:57,102
I'm obligated to go to Yezhou Garrison

482
00:27:57,502 --> 00:27:58,462
for mediation.

483
00:27:59,062 --> 00:27:59,902
It's just that

484
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,262
I've never been there.

485
00:28:02,903 --> 00:28:05,222
Besides, I'm merely a scholar.

486
00:28:05,742 --> 00:28:06,782
Unlike you,

487
00:28:07,702 --> 00:28:09,103
who commands numerous talents,

488
00:28:09,742 --> 00:28:12,423
I only have one maid working for me.

489
00:28:19,863 --> 00:28:22,022
My guard here knows some martial arts.

490
00:28:22,502 --> 00:28:24,302
Once you arrive in Yezhou,

491
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:25,742
you can ask him to run your errands

492
00:28:25,742 --> 00:28:27,143
if you need anything.

493
00:28:31,222 --> 00:28:32,623
That would be most helpful.

494
00:28:33,982 --> 00:28:34,822
But

495
00:28:35,502 --> 00:28:36,423
I can't travel fast.

496
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:38,183
Perhaps, I'll meet

497
00:28:38,782 --> 00:28:39,622
your guard in Yezhou

498
00:28:39,982 --> 00:28:42,608
so as not to make Magistrate Sun wait.

499
00:28:45,262 --> 00:28:46,102
Alright.

500
00:28:47,888 --> 00:28:50,128
Then I'll take my leave.

501
00:29:03,062 --> 00:29:04,222
Once you reach Yezhou,

502
00:29:04,222 --> 00:29:05,742
go straight to Sun Xiangfu

503
00:29:05,742 --> 00:29:06,623
for cooperation.

504
00:29:15,423 --> 00:29:16,432
General,

505
00:29:16,432 --> 00:29:17,382
won't you

506
00:29:18,143 --> 00:29:19,062
be implicated?

507
00:29:19,502 --> 00:29:20,342
What's the problem?

508
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:22,863
Yezhou is Sun Xiangfu's territory.

509
00:29:22,863 --> 00:29:24,080
Even if things go south,

510
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,352
Sun Xiangfu is to blame
for his incompetence.

511
00:29:26,352 --> 00:29:28,583
What does it have to do with me?

512
00:29:30,782 --> 00:29:31,622
Chu Zhao wants

513
00:29:31,782 --> 00:29:33,103
to claim credit from Chancellor.

514
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:35,982
We can't let him steal the spotlight.

515
00:29:36,982 --> 00:29:37,822
So, Ding Yi,

516
00:29:38,222 --> 00:29:39,856
make sure you succeed.

517
00:29:40,183 --> 00:29:41,143
No mistakes are allowed.

518
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:43,822
Yes.

519
00:29:49,183 --> 00:29:53,040
(Chu Mansion)

520
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,542
(Late Mother, Chu Mingfang)

521
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,382
Mother,

522
00:29:56,823 --> 00:29:58,022
I'm going to Yezhou.

523
00:29:59,262 --> 00:30:00,624
I won't be able to speak

524
00:30:01,103 --> 00:30:02,302
with you for a while.

525
00:30:16,623 --> 00:30:17,463
Young Master.

526
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,663
He Rufei envies
that you're valued by Mr. Xu

527
00:30:20,302 --> 00:30:21,982
and is eager to impress Mr. Xu.

528
00:30:22,742 --> 00:30:24,262
If his men reach Yezhou,

529
00:30:24,496 --> 00:30:25,840
they might ruin everything.

530
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:27,423
You're mistaken.

531
00:30:28,062 --> 00:30:28,902
They'll help us.

532
00:30:29,623 --> 00:30:31,183
He Rufei's guard is

533
00:30:31,183 --> 00:30:32,023
as skilled as you

534
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:33,623
in martial arts.

535
00:30:34,103 --> 00:30:35,742
It'll save me much effort

536
00:30:36,423 --> 00:30:37,702
if he takes on Xiao Jue first.

537
00:30:38,863 --> 00:30:40,143
Besides, once he steps in,

538
00:30:40,863 --> 00:30:41,703
whatever happens

539
00:30:42,302 --> 00:30:44,183
won't trace back to Master.

540
00:30:44,823 --> 00:30:46,183
And I can stay in the shadows,

541
00:30:46,702 --> 00:30:49,183
watch them stir things up in Yezhou,

542
00:30:49,663 --> 00:30:50,503
and find a chance

543
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,823
to obtain what Sun Xiangfu holds.

544
00:30:59,903 --> 00:31:00,743
Alright. Thanks.

545
00:31:04,383 --> 00:31:05,223
Try it.

546
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:06,583
Another veggie dish?

547
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,143
The meat dishes will come.

548
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:11,742
Here we go.

549
00:31:11,742 --> 00:31:13,423
Let's all eat and drink heartily today.

550
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:14,423
Happy Mid-Autumn!

551
00:31:14,423 --> 00:31:15,536
- Happy Mid-Autumn!
- Happy Mid-Autumn!

552
00:31:21,982 --> 00:31:23,143
Come on, try this.

553
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:26,183
He Yan.

554
00:31:26,502 --> 00:31:27,342
He Yan.

555
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:29,392
Why are you zoning out?

556
00:31:29,623 --> 00:31:30,463
What's out there?

557
00:31:31,103 --> 00:31:32,542
Isn't it the Mid-Autumn banquet?

558
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:33,742
Where is the Commander?

559
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:35,760
Huaijin won't come.

560
00:31:37,782 --> 00:31:38,622
Why not?

561
00:31:39,343 --> 00:31:41,343
Since when do you care
so much about him?

562
00:31:42,462 --> 00:31:44,863
Wasn't he supposed to
announce the enrollment

563
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:46,743
into the Nine Banners Battalion?

564
00:31:47,183 --> 00:31:48,183
If he came,

565
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:49,623
would you dare

566
00:31:49,623 --> 00:31:51,222
to eat and drink so casually?

567
00:31:53,143 --> 00:31:53,983
That's what I mean.

568
00:31:54,343 --> 00:31:55,423
You're awkward around him.

569
00:31:55,702 --> 00:31:57,382
He's uneasy in such lively places, too.

570
00:31:57,462 --> 00:31:58,302
Why make everyone

571
00:31:58,302 --> 00:31:59,183
uncomfortable?

572
00:32:00,942 --> 00:32:01,782
Come on.

573
00:32:01,782 --> 00:32:02,622
Top performer.

574
00:32:02,903 --> 00:32:03,743
You go first.

575
00:32:05,902 --> 00:32:07,262
Pass them around, guys.

576
00:32:07,262 --> 00:32:08,102
Alright.

577
00:32:10,302 --> 00:32:11,302
(What's mine is mine.)

578
00:32:12,302 --> 00:32:13,648
(I can wait a bit longer.)

579
00:32:15,062 --> 00:32:15,982
(Joining the battalion)

580
00:32:16,903 --> 00:32:19,783
(brings me one step closer
to reclaiming my position.)

581
00:32:24,982 --> 00:32:25,903
Mr. Shen.

582
00:32:26,423 --> 00:32:27,263
Go on.

583
00:32:27,343 --> 00:32:28,183
Dig in.

584
00:32:28,343 --> 00:32:29,183
Don't hold back.

585
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:30,703
- Sit down.
- Yes.

586
00:32:32,262 --> 00:32:33,102
Come on, dig in.

587
00:32:33,383 --> 00:32:34,223
This is

588
00:32:34,383 --> 00:32:35,702
a Mid-Autumn feast

589
00:32:35,702 --> 00:32:37,742
as well as your celebration banquet.

590
00:32:38,863 --> 00:32:40,583
We're usually not allowed to drink,

591
00:32:41,663 --> 00:32:43,143
but you won first place.

592
00:32:43,782 --> 00:32:44,622
So I

593
00:32:44,623 --> 00:32:46,502
brought this reward for you.

594
00:32:48,542 --> 00:32:49,382
Easy.

595
00:32:49,823 --> 00:32:50,782
Don't be late

596
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,542
for the morning training.

597
00:32:53,143 --> 00:32:54,782
Or you'll face military discipline.

598
00:32:55,222 --> 00:32:56,062
- Yes.
- Yes.

599
00:32:56,062 --> 00:32:56,902
Yes.

600
00:32:57,063 --> 00:32:57,903
Get bowls.

601
00:32:57,903 --> 00:32:58,823
Get bowls. Hurry.

602
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:02,862
Come on.

603
00:33:03,302 --> 00:33:04,142
Look at you.

604
00:33:06,502 --> 00:33:07,342
Mr. Shen.

605
00:33:08,423 --> 00:33:09,263
Need something?

606
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:12,582
Mr. Shen.

607
00:33:13,022 --> 00:33:15,143
Are you here to announce the enrollment?

608
00:33:18,182 --> 00:33:19,022
Mr. Shen,

609
00:33:19,022 --> 00:33:20,423
do you have good news

610
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:21,823
for us?

611
00:33:22,742 --> 00:33:23,582
Yeah, Mr. Shen.

612
00:33:23,662 --> 00:33:25,342
Stop keeping us in suspense.

613
00:33:25,623 --> 00:33:26,463
Yeah.

614
00:33:29,302 --> 00:33:30,142
Yeah.

615
00:33:30,422 --> 00:33:32,183
After I'm done here,

616
00:33:32,782 --> 00:33:33,702
I'll offer Lei Hou

617
00:33:34,103 --> 00:33:34,943
my congratulations.

618
00:33:37,662 --> 00:33:38,502
Lei Hou?

619
00:33:38,502 --> 00:33:39,342
Lei Hou?

620
00:33:40,183 --> 00:33:41,023
Not He Yan?

621
00:33:41,343 --> 00:33:42,262
Wait, Mr. Shen.

622
00:33:42,383 --> 00:33:43,502
But He took first place...

623
00:33:43,823 --> 00:33:45,383
So what?

624
00:33:47,423 --> 00:33:48,263
Get back to it.

625
00:33:48,502 --> 00:33:49,342
Don't make a scene.

626
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:51,823
Listen up.

627
00:33:52,423 --> 00:33:53,742
Commander selected soldiers

628
00:33:54,222 --> 00:33:56,263
based on a comprehensive evaluation.

629
00:33:57,022 --> 00:33:59,462
The contest was just one aspect.

630
00:34:01,823 --> 00:34:02,663
He Yan.

631
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,423
Stay sharp.

632
00:34:04,702 --> 00:34:05,863
You've got real potential.

633
00:34:06,183 --> 00:34:07,742
You'll have many more chances.
