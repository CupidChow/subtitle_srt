1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let me run to the next level

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Go through the snowfall

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Climb over the high mountains

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hold my hand and I will live for love

5
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Like the song of the sky

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The love of my life

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's all for today

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You should study hard when you go back

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I will give you a test tomorrow

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He is so nosy all day

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Is there something wrong?

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Watch me

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Give it back

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You want to take it?

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Come on, kid

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Give it back

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Give it back

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Give it back

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Go

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Thank you

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You are so clumsy

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You don't know how to enter the theater

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Have a good dinner

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's not the choice of each person

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Besides, I am not clumsy

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Go

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Go

31
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You are so clumsy

32
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Give it back

33
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Give it back

34
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Give it back

35
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Give it back

36
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So sorry, little Toot

37
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You again

38
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,480
Were you yearning for it,

39
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,340
so you at once thought it's very much

40
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,780
for she also brings you happiness?

41
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:44,960
Xiao

42
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,720
he couldn't have delivered a better armor

43
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,160
She destroyed it

44
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,600
WhoWORTH

45
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,960
This is his true weapon

46
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,120
He doesn't guard

47
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,680
If we don't have the evidence, he won't reconcile

48
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,600
What we need to do

49
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,120
is to expose a flaw

50
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,160
Shan Han

51
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:55,040
ивает

52
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,440
can

53
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,700
It's good if it can be like them.

54
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,260
Who are they?

55
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,300
The 97th Battalion?

56
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,860
The 97th Battalion?

57
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,500
What is the 97th Battalion?

58
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,740
I don't know about the 97th Battalion.

59
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,260
It was founded by Master Xiao.

60
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,180
All the candidates are exquisite.

61
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,620
They are all well-dressed.

62
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,420
The 97th Battalion is known for its

63
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,940
core exquisiteness of the Xiao Family.

64
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,100
The enemy is unparalleled.

65
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,300
Why is everyone

66
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,060
discussing the 97th Battalion all of a sudden?

67
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,060
I wonder who mentioned it first.

68
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,380
No one wants to enter the 97th Battalion, right?

69
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,260
Everyone is talking about the 97th Battalion.

70
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,980
Could it be that someone secretly took advantage of it?

71
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,620
It seems that last night at the hot spring,

72
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,620
Xiao Jue still noticed something.

73
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,580
That's why he deliberately ran out of bait

74
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,020
to lure me into the trap.

75
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,340
bait?

76
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,140
Then I will enter the 97th Battalion

77
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,300
as soon as possible.

78
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,300
And I have to enter it openly and openly.

79
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,420
There is no flaw.

80
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,420
Who is bait and who is prey

81
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,740
is not sure.

82
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,060
Instructor Shen.

83
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,300
Instructor Shen.

84
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:09,940
What are you thinking about?

85
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,780
Instructor Shen.

86
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,900
Instructor Shen.

87
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,500
You can also join the 97th Battalion

88
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,540
if you work harder.

89
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,780
The 97th Battalion is so powerful.

90
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,860
Of course I have to enter it.

91
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,380
Don't think that the 97th Battalion is powerful

92
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,420
and you want to join it.

93
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,060
But the 97th Battalion often sits in the vanguard.

94
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,900
The king of Shang is also unparalleled.

95
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,300
Isn't that just right?

96
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,860
The 97th Battalion needs reinforcements,

97
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,100
and I need military power.

98
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,580
If I enter the 97th Battalion,

99
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,020
wouldn't it be perfect?

100
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,180
This year, I will indeed choose a new soldier.

101
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,260
But it must be the best one.

102
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,540
Then this year,

103
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,380
you don't have to bother.

104
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,980
Because the best one

105
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,500
is right in front of you.

106
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,060
Okay.

107
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,740
I'll wait and see.

108
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,380
Brother, come here.

109
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,660
There is meat and meatloaf today.

110
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,020
Meatloaf?

111
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,220
The cake in your hand is mine.

112
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,540
Yours?

113
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,020
Did he promise you?

114
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,220
Who can prove that this cake is yours?

115
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,780
I ate it.

116
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,020
What do you think?

117
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,260
What do you think?

118
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,580
You...

119
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:35,860
Me?

120
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,060
I did it.

121
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,300
Who can prove it?

122
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,380
You are my brother.

123
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:41,980
You...

124
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,420
What do you want?

125
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,660
Fine.

126
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,460
You can't wait for me anymore.

127
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,300
Enough, Brother He.

128
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,900
Don't be so hard on them.

129
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,620
He took my cake for the first time,

130
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,220
and now he takes my cake for the second time.

131
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,180
He took my cake every day.

132
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,340
Do I have to starve every day?

133
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,500
There is no such unfair thing in this world.

134
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,460
You are talking about fairness with me?

135
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,460
You are here.

136
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,940
Can you live a month?

137
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,060
No, I can't.

138
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,580
I don't need to live for another month.

139
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,020
Ten days later,

140
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,140
in the martial arts arena,

141
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,500
I will be better than you.

142
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,300
Are you hungry?

143
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,700
Do you know what you are talking about?

144
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,820
Which word didn't you hear clearly?

145
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,020
I'll say it again.

146
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,700
Ten days later,

147
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,540
I will be better than you.

148
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,380
You are so bold.

149
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,700
Enough.

150
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,220
You are so arrogant.

151
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:45,860
Yes.

152
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,660
Fine.

153
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,100
If you lose,

154
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,780
you will be a living corpse.

155
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:51,980
Fine.

156
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,860
If you lose,

157
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,420
call me boss.

158
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,140
You are so humiliating.

159
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,060
Ten days later,

160
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,420
I will challenge you to a gun fight.

161
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,780
Do you dare to fight?

162
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,660
Since you are so ignorant,

163
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,180
I will play with you.

164
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,620
Okay.

165
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,620
Ten days later,

166
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,660
we will fight with you.

167
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,740
No.

168
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,900
Boss.

169
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,100
You dare to ask for a fight when you just arrived in the military camp.

170
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,020
Do you still have military weapons?

171
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,420
It doesn't matter.

172
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,700
Doesn't he want to enter the nine-sword camp?

173
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,700
I just want to see

174
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,820
if he is enough.

175
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,060
He has crossed the border.

176
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,620
The wind blows day and night.

177
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,660
The water is the belief.

178
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,260
The dream is the light.

179
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,060
The wind is the light.

180
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,820
The unwavering wish.

181
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,340
The blinding dream.

182
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,940
Who cares about the wildness?

183
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,980
The hot show.

184
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,140
The stubbornness of life.

185
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,980
Flying in the world.

186
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,700
There must be hope.

187
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:40,340
Overcome those wounds and search for the light.

188
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,540
Fall into the light in the star sea.

189
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,540
Unleash the wound and point me to you.

190
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:52,620
The courage to wait for the light is the power of existence.

191
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,860
Fall into the light in the star sea.

192
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,860
The eyes are full of the power of the sound of the sound of the sound.

193
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:05,660
The courage to wait for the light is the power of existence.

194
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,020
Fall into the light in the star sea.

195
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,820
You are still so unyielding

196
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,860
after all these efforts.

197
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:34,140
Are you the one who broke the hot spring that day?

198
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,260
I did go to the hot spring to relieve myself

199
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,980
because I was tired from training.

200
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,100
So the person who shared the bath was you.

201
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,300
But I was frightened that night.

202
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,420
I was in a panic.

203
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,460
Please don't blame me.

204
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,660
Panic?

205
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,740
I was really panicked.

206
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,020
You are suspicious and lied.

207
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,100
What's on your mind?

208
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,820
Center of Truth.

209
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,700
What's that?

210
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,660
Excuse me.

211
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
Please instruct your son.

212
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,140
Please continue to watch

213
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,780
Why do you think I will teach you

214
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,180
Otherwise, in the middle of the night

215
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,060
The commander will not be so bored

216
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,540
Come out and sneak a new soldier

217
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,100
I know the commander must be concerned

218
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,500
Think I am a talent who can be cultivated

219
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,220
Practice guns need opponents

220
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,580
I fight alone

221
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,700
Is being accompanied

222
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,180
If the commander does not teach

223
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,660
I believe I can do it twice

224
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,740
You are so shameless

225
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,820
If you can take me out of the circle

226
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,940
I will teach you

227
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,220
It's a deal

228
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,480
Cory

229
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,460
I know grey

230
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,660
Bothered

231
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,500
So the idea of policing

232
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,860
I did not understand

233
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,900
Know

234
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,000
You will learn

235
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,940
I can't hold the edge

236
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,300
Can't understand

237
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,100
And can't hold the doors

238
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,220
Open the door

239
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,260
Pull the girl

240
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,180
Cease competition

241
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,060
Sometimes it's a little hard

242
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,300
Even if I highway

243
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,420
I bird

244
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,940
I figure it out

245
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,380
I'm still in the spring.

246
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,340
I didn't check.

247
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,780
I offended you for a moment.

248
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,100
But,

249
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,620
since you said so,

250
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,380
I'll do my best to help you.

251
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,260
I'll do my best to help you.

252
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,700
I'll do my best to help you.

253
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,300
I'll do my best to help you.

254
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,700
I'll do my best to help you.

255
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,140
You can't just do nothing,

256
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,900
and definitely look for enemies.

257
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,180
You can't hold back.

258
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,620
You'd better be in line.

259
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,220
You'd better be in line.

260
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,420
welcomed.

261
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,420
You have such a fat mouth.

262
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,620
And such a demonstration.

263
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,380
Thank you.

264
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,020
Thank you, master.

265
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,460
This is the first lesson.

266
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,060
Remember what you said.

267
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,420
If you can't win,

268
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,260
get out of the Night's Trap.

269
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,100
Since you use the Nine Banner Camp as bait,

270
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,900
I will never let you down.

271
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,660
I will use your power

272
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,060
to clear the clouds.

273
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:27,680
Swallow it,

274
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,060
then run away.

275
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,220
I learn so fast.

276
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,320
Doutu

277
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,720
Doutu

278
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,200
The horse is hard to chase

279
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,200
You can't regret it

280
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,040
I said nothing

281
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,620
I've practiced the skills of spear and sword.

282
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,460
But Duoduo didn't ask me.

283
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,100
No.

284
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,620
I must let him see my achievements in person.

285
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,180
Duoduo.

286
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,700
Are you there?

287
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,660
I'm here.

288
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,580
I'm here.

289
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,380
I'm here.

290
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,180
I'm here.

291
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:50,980
I'm here.

292
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:51,780
I'm here.

293
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,580
I'm here.

294
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,380
I'm here.

295
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,180
I'm here.

296
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:54,980
I'm here.

297
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:55,780
I'm here.

298
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,580
I'm here.

299
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,380
I'm here.

300
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,940
Qinglong.

301
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,100
Qinglong.

302
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:35,980
k

303
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,620
Qinglong.

304
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,720
I've been looking for it for a long time.

305
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,460
I've been looking for it for a long time.

306
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,760
It's been a long time.

307
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,340
I once asked my master to make two sword for me.

308
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,340
One was for Yinqiu.

309
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,920
I gave it to her when I was still young.

310
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,460
This is called the Blue Wolf.

311
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,540
I'll give it to you today.

312
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,160
This sword is too precious.

313
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,160
I can't take it.

314
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,700
The rope is broken.

315
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,700
The water is dripping.

316
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,420
One day, you two will become the stars of our Wei State.

317
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,620
You'll be strong and strong.

318
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,620
You'll protect the people and the people.

319
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,620
Take it.

320
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,120
I won't let you down.

321
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,620
This...

322
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,620
This sword isn't worthy of the Blue Wolf that my father gave you.

323
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,620
This sword is so rare.

324
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,620
I'm so happy to have it.

325
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,620
I can't help but use it.

326
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,620
Du Du, you have a lot of people.

327
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,620
You won't mind, will you?

328
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,620
Your sword is quite good too.

329
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,620
Why did you come to my tent?

330
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,620
I'm here to see you.

331
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,620
I'm here to see you.

332
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,660
I've been practicing hard.

333
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,660
I've learned all the moves of Du Du.

334
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,660
You don't have to worry about me.

335
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,660
Get out of my way.

336
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,660
Come.

337
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,660
I know that you're the most straightforward.

338
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,700
Come.

339
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,700
Come.

340
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,700
Come.

341
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,700
Come.

342
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,700
Come.

343
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,700
Come.

344
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,700
Come.

345
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,700
Come, come, come.

346
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,700
Which one do you want?

347
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,700
One for my father.

348
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,700
My father?

349
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,700
One for father.

350
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,700
Who do you want?

351
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,700
One for my father.

352
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,700
Two?

353
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,700
Three?

354
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,700
Okay.

355
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,700
Two for my father.

356
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,700
Okay, okay.

357
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,460
Six!

358
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,260
Black cake! Black cake!

359
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,660
Six!

360
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,260
How is it, brother?

361
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,620
Deng Zheng, remember it!

362
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,340
Okay, okay.

363
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,220
Remember it.

364
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:49,820
Come on.

365
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,420
They put the lotus leaves on the table earlier than me.

366
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,500
Everyone,

367
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,020
I'll have ten pieces of dry cakes

368
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,420
and all of them with lotus leaves.

369
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,940
Childe Cheng,

370
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,660
are you sure that you'll have lotus leaves?

371
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,300
Yes.

372
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,460
You're really a good boy,

373
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,500
you just don't lack the cakes.

374
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,660
Have more.

375
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,140
Wild anger lifted up!

376
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,140
Come on!

377
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,020
Unake, bring the lotus leaves down!

378
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,140
Come on!

379
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,780
Do your best, round three,

380
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,100
wild anger lifted up!

381
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,220
Unake.

382
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,740
Come on!

383
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,540
You can do it, white ISFирmen.

384
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,100
Boxuxiu granted lotus leaves.

385
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,540
Boxuxiu is winning!

386
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,220
Unake is winning!

387
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,380
Have you got them?

388
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,580
I have got no one.

389
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:41,980
Kid,

390
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,100
you still have time to regret it.

391
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,900
Exactly.

392
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,900
Get out now.

393
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,340
What a coincidence.

394
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,180
I also want to tell you this.

395
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,220
You don't know what's good for you.

396
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,060
We will win!

397
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,300
We will win!

398
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,540
We will win!

399
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,900
We will win!

400
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,660
We will win!

401
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,260
We will win!

402
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:02,940
We will win!

403
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,900
We will win!

404
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,940
We will win!

405
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,700
We will win!

406
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,660
We will win!

407
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,820
We will win!

408
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,140
Amazing!

409
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,220
Good!

410
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,260
Our Kansas City colored opponent,

411
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,380
Li select,

412
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,380
Li childe.

413
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,140
assume!

414
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,140
encouraging!

415
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:33,740
Really cocky,

416
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,460
Naughty man,

417
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,160
opening the Pastral Department

418
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,800
Come promiss法

419
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,080
Nurture him

420
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,520
Promiss

421
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,260
I have issued the Fifth Code

422
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,960
Give it

423
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,920
Right

424
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,480
I said, You are cort

425
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,080
I said, You are target

426
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:01,900
Right

427
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,200
Come promiss

428
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:14,820
Master, take it to me, Le'ts go another place, my dear.

429
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,180
Okay

430
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,380
Looks like they're quite powerful in combat.

431
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,020
Why have I been so egotistical?

432
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,780
But I'm in a car.

433
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:39,340
contract

434
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,220
Your annual income

435
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,100
Never mind.

436
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,060
Contact

437
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,100
No, I mean the tiger and the dragon.

438
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,500
The king and the lotus are both good.

439
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,260
That's because you taught them well.

440
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,420
No, Childe Cheng.

441
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,740
I don't dare to take the credit.

442
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,980
It's the director's duty to teach the soldiers.

443
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,940
My eyes are so accurate.

444
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,340
Do you remember our bet?

445
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,860
Don't cheat.

446
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,620
Coach Shen, who do you think is better?

447
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,340
The king doesn't need to say.

448
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,340
He's from a noble family.

449
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,620
But his skill is really good.

450
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,340
He Yan is really gentle and gentle.

451
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,020
After a few years,

452
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,340
he will be the best of the new soldiers.

453
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,900
Coach Shen, you're wrong.

454
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,220
The one who's not proud is not the king.

455
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,580
But He Yan is getting more and more interesting.

456
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,940
When you're done, we'll...

457
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,020
When we're done?

458
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,620
Let's start.

459
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:53,020
Keep it up!

460
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,380
Keep it up!

461
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,780
Good.

462
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,380
Good, good inputs.

463
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,860
Keep it up, keep it up.

464
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,420
Great!

465
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,180
Good.

466
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,260
Good.

467
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,500
Good.

468
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,100
Good.

469
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,100
Good.

470
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,100
Good.

471
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,100
Good.

472
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,100
Good.

473
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,100
Good.

474
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,100
Good.

475
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,100
Good.

476
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,100
Good.

477
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,100
Good.

478
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,100
Good.

479
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,100
Good.

480
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,100
He is so strong.

481
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,100
He is just a new soldier.

482
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,100
Good.

483
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,100
Good.

484
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,100
Good.

485
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,100
Good.

486
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,100
Why is he so good at fighting?

487
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,100
Good.

488
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,100
Good.

489
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,100
Good.

490
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,100
Hurry up.

491
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,100
You almost hit his head.

492
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,100
Good.

493
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,100
Good.

494
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,100
Good.

495
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,100
Good.

496
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,100
Good.

497
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,100
Good.

498
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,100
Good.

499
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,100
Good.

500
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,100
Good.

501
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,100
Good.

502
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,100
Good.

503
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,100
Good.

504
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,100
Good.

505
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,100
Good.

506
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,100
He is testing me.

507
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,100
Good.

508
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,100
You are so beautiful when you were flashed.

509
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,100
Good.

510
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,100
Good.

511
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,100
Duoduo.

512
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,100
The way you flashed just now was like...

513
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,100
Good.

514
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,100
Good.

515
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,100
Good.

516
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,100
Good.

517
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,100
But he didn't escape from your lion.

518
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,100
He didn't do that on purpose.

519
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,100
You're not a good fighter.

520
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,100
Good.

521
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,100
Good.

522
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,100
You're not a good fighter.

523
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,100
One more.

524
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,100
Another.

525
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,100
Good.

526
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,100
Good.

527
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,100
Good.

528
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,100
Good.

529
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,100
Good.

530
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,100
Good.

531
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,100
Good.

532
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,100
Good.

533
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,100
Good.

534
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,100
Good.

535
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,100
Love and hate come and go.

536
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,100
Good.

537
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,100
Good.

538
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,100
People cannot see their publisher in a real way.

539
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,100
It means Zhu Qi is as brave as a game.

540
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,100
Good.

541
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,100
Good.

542
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,100
Love and hate come and go.

543
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,100
You...

544
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,100
It's not good.

545
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,100
Good.

546
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,940
What a shame!

547
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,300
Little white face.

548
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,100
Anything else?

549
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,380
I'm willing to bet and admit defeat.

550
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,460
Boss.

551
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,700
So this is the matter.

552
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,780
I almost forgot it if you didn't tell me.

553
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,140
It seems that

554
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,380
there is another person who wants to tell me.

555
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,900
Forget it.

556
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,140
founders.

557
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,380
It's your turn, right?

558
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,540
Don't be trying to fool me.

559
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,500
Hand.

560
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,380
Or, you...

561
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,180
Big!

562
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,500
I'm calling.

563
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,820
I heard it.

564
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,380
I just didn't expect you to say it.

565
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,260
Big man...

566
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,580
One word...

567
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,820
That's it.

568
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,460
I'm calling.

569
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,260
What are you doing?

570
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,580
What are you doing?

571
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,540
Go!

572
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,100
Let's go.

573
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,780
Go.

574
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,500
Go.

575
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,020
Let's go practice.

576
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,260
It's so nice.

577
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,220
It's so nice.

578
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:58,980
It's so nice.

579
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,740
It's so nice.

580
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,660
Please wait.

581
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,100
I...

582
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,220
I forgot something.

583
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,860
Thank you.

584
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,340
It's for you.

585
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,940
I'll be sensitive and considerate.

586
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,740
Please forgive me.

587
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,900
Here they are.

588
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,460
Thank you.

589
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,220
Everyone.

590
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,860
Thanks to you,

591
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,860
I won the game.

592
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,500
I'll be the east tonight.

593
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,860
Don't be so polite.

594
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,380
Why are you standing there?

595
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,260
Hurry up.

596
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,060
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

597
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,660
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

598
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,060
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

599
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,380
Let's eat.

600
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,100
I'm a little bit inferior.

601
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,500
But you're so considerate.

602
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,420
I'm a little bit inferior.

603
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,420
Mr. Cheng, you're thinking too much.

604
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,860
I mean,

605
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,980
you won so many games.

606
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,140
Is it enough to eat so many?

607
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,660
I'm doing this to repay you.

608
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,620
You're so ungrateful.

609
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,660
It's worth it.

610
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,580
Bring it in if you win.

611
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,340
Great.

612
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,660
It smells so good.

613
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,060
It smells so good.

614
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,260
It smells so good.

615
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,300
It smells so good.

616
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,300
It smells so good.

617
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,300
It smells so good.

618
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,300
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

619
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,300
The soup is here.

620
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,980
You're the best in the Yezhou.

621
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,300
You must be very hungry.

622
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,500
Brother He.

623
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,220
You've been practicing hard for a month.

624
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,100
That's why you're so energetic today.

625
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,300
We're both a little bit tired.

626
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:42,980
Brother He.

627
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,460
Congratulations.

628
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,740
Thank you, Brother Lei.

629
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,380
Duoduo.

630
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,660
What do you mean by he doesn't want to hide

631
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,380
in the dance studio during the day?

632
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,620
I used the nine-grain-grain-grain as a bait

633
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,300
to lure him to the stage.

634
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,060
While he was playing with the sub-characters,

635
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,140
he secretly attacked.

636
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,860
I intended to force him to show his weakness.

637
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,660
But he actually

638
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,740
figured out my intention to test him.

639
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,420
So he didn't hide on purpose.

640
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,060
He's not only tough,

641
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,340
but also smart.

642
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,580
He's indeed a tough opponent.

643
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,700
Anyway,

644
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,980
He Yan is not a good person.

645
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,100
How about we arrest him before the summer vacation?

646
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,060
No hurry.

647
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,540
Do you have a plan?

648
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:36,220
The new recruits have been training for a month.

649
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,900
It's time to defeat them.

650
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,900
Then we'll see the result.
