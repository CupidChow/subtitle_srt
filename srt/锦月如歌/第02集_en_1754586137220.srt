1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let me run to the next level

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Go through the snowfall

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Climb over the high mountains

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hold my hand and I will live for love

5
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Like the song of the sky

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

7
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This is your first time to study

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I know your family is in trouble

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You used to be a rich man

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You need to study hard and study hard

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Then you can succeed and serve the country

12
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What's your name?

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why do you always wear a mask?

14
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's rude to not show your real face

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Sir, I am not a student

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I am afraid of scaring others because of my ugly face

17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So I can't take off my mask

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This is the second son of the Xiao family

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He is as handsome as the legend

20
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I am late because of my bad luck

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Please forgive me

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Go

24
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You are not allowed to show your ugly face

25
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I am here to accompany you

26
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You are so rude to me

27
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You can go back to marry me

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If I can't defeat you, I would have beaten you to death

29
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Feilu, send Mr. Cheng to the court

30
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes

31
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Are you really going to kill me?

32
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I am just trying to escape from the wedding

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I can't die

34
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I am not afraid of death

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I am not afraid of death

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I am just trying to escape from the wedding

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I can't die

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I will beat you to death

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Xiao Xue

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Du Du

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Uncle

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We are almost the same age

43
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But you are my uncle

44
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Let me stay

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Ok?

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Thank you

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Go

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Go

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Go

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Go

51
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Go

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Go

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If you are a woman, it will be a hidden danger

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So I prepared a man's body for you

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
His name is He Yan

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You are He Yan?

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes

58
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He Yan and He Yan are different

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Master is so kind

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Go to the left tent first

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
After passing, go to the right tent

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Get clothes and supplies

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Thank you

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Next

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Sir, what is Zeyue?

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You don't know what Zeyue is

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's simple

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Go in and check the army

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You can pass as long as you are healthy

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Thank you

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Next

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The horse is so tall

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Maybe it's because it's not well-fed

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's not healthy

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You can tell it what disease it has

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What?

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You want the imperial physician to treat the horse?

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You are a doctor

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You should be a man

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Besides, the Yezhou Guards don't raise the idle

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It will be useful if you want to stay

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Thank god it's a horse

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I can't help it if I treat it

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
If it's a horse, I can't help it

85
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Xiao Jue, look

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I can treat horses

87
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I can train horses

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The horse is here

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Hurry

90
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Hurry

91
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes

92
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The horse is the only way to train horses

93
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He is He Rufei's man

94
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh, no

95
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The army of the Imperial Army has a flaw

96
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Xiao Jue saw it

97
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Good

98
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's different from what I used to do

99
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You can't catch up with the horse

100
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
he just showed

101
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yes

102
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I have to go down

103
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh, no

104
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Xiao Jue knows the move of the Imperial Army

105
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
He must have recognized it

106
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But he doesn't know the color of life

107
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
He thinks I'm He Rufei's man

108
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
He wants to use the backhand to deal with me

109
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Go

110
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Go

111
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Come on

112
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Go

113
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Come on

114
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Come on

115
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Great

116
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You are so capable

117
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
No

118
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I can't compete with you

119
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The army needs a good horse like you

120
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But I haven't finished the moon yet

121
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What moon?

122
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Such a powerful horse can tame

123
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's not a bad horse

124
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Wait for me

125
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'll take you out

126
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Go

127
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Thank you, instructor

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So naughty

129
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Turn around

130
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You doubt the woman

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Why didn't you just kill her?

132
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
If she is the spy sent by the person who is really evil

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
There will be consequences if you kill one

134
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's better to leave her alone

135
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Maybe we can get the master behind

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I don't know if the master is He Rufei or Xu Jingfu

137
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You said that the old general was in the court before the battle

138
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
He was ambushed and killed by Ming Shui

139
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He Rufei's army is obviously stationed a hundred miles away

140
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But he came to support the old general on the seventh day after sending the letter of pleading

141
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's obviously a delay

142
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
In my opinion, they are a perfect match

143
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But these are not the real evidence

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We can't prove that the failure of the battle of Ming Shui is related to Xu Jingfu and He Rufei

145
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We can't prove that they are colluding

146
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Now the Xiao's army is weak

147
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And we are suspected by the emperor

148
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We can only find out the truth

149
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
There is a shortage of military supplies here

150
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's very difficult to train a new army

151
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I want to see who he is

152
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes

153
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Please

154
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Mister

155
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,600
But no one expected that he would be so cruel

156
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,080
and defeat the enemy

157
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,720
after the water and smoke were cut off.

158
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,280
It's just that

159
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,640
I feel sorry for those innocent souls.

160
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,840
Zi Lan,

161
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,960
you have eliminated the evil nature of the water and smoke

162
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,120
and sent tens of thousands of people to die.

163
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,080
You even told the world

164
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,240
that you had declared his evil name.

165
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,440
His Majesty is even more afraid of him.

166
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,520
Although I have won,

167
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,920
I am still a general.

168
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,000
I have been sent to the city of Yezhou.

169
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,200
Even if I recover my military power,

170
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,240
I don't know what kind of army

171
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,400
I can fight in that cold place.

172
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,000
Besides,

173
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,960
I have found a missing piece of land

174
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,920
in the city of Que.

175
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,760
I have deployed it as a secret weapon.

176
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,880
In ten days,

177
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,640
it will definitely become a barrier.

178
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,080
Good.

179
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,960
Take good care of yourself these days.

180
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,960
I will give you more important tasks in the future.

181
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,000
I will obey your order.

182
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,400
Chu Zhang.

183
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,840
You are finally back.

184
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,200
Have you brought me a gift?

185
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,640
You are getting more and more irregular.

186
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,400
Father.

187
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,680
How do you feel?

188
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,960
I feel like you would meet for the first time in my life.

189
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,080
You're not going to the blood experienced strike you want in the past,

190
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,840
are you?

191
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,600
Hurry to lie to me myself.

192
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,960
What fragrance is this?

193
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,600
You'll know when you try.

194
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,080
Are you going to play with me?

195
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,400
Lend it to me.

196
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,280
I just might as well stay out of it.

197
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,520
Go!

198
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Let me try.

199
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Don't try it.

200
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,440
Just use the candlelight.

201
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,280
I can't reach it!

202
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
I can't reach it!

203
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Let me see.

204
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,400
You're hurt.

205
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
Are you okay?

206
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
I'm fine.

207
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
It's just a little hot.

208
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
It's not stable.

209
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Episode 16

210
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Young Master.

211
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You're hurt.

212
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I know you hurt your left arm.

213
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I was thinking about something else.

214
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But...

215
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Not only did I lose my job,

216
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I was also hurt by Liu Ming.

217
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm really sorry for you.

218
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You hit me too hard.

219
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I want to get your hammer face.

220
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I have to pay for it.

221
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Hit!

222
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Hit!

223
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Hit!

224
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Hit!

225
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,660
Mountain bandits?

226
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,720
Get out of the way!

227
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,340
Dep drowning...

228
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,980
It seems that he served in jail

229
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,180
as a dogsounder.

230
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,140
Eat some.

231
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,260
You're resourceful.

232
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,640
Thank you, two modecend staffs.

233
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,520
I'm sorry.

234
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,600
I'm sorry.

235
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Thank you.

236
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,200
Here, drink some water.

237
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,000
You're from the Escort.

238
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,120
You're good at martial arts.

239
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,960
What are you looking at?

240
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,400
You little white face.

241
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,600
You're whiter than me.

242
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,880
You even have the nerve to talk about me.

243
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,520
I thought

244
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,880
I was already

245
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,120
short in the camp.

246
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,160
But I didn't expect

247
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,640
you're as short as me.

248
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,880
Fine.

249
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,000
Let's eat more

250
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,920
and grow taller together.

251
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,680
By the way,

252
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,840
what's your name?

253
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,120
He Yan.

254
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,720
Then I'll call you

255
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,880
Brother He.

256
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
Okay.

257
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,160
I'm Xiao Mai.

258
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,280
Who's from the Escort?

259
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,160
You sleep here.

260
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,760
Let me.

261
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,760
This man seems to be from the Escort.

262
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,280
But he's wearing a Buddha bead.

263
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,400
Interesting.

264
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,840
Thank you.

265
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,840
Brother He.

266
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,920
You sleep here tonight.

267
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,560
Okay.

268
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,520
Let me help you.

269
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,520
It's okay.

270
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,440
You always say that you don't like Xiao Jue.

271
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,640
But you know that

272
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,040
Xiao Jue is a man of great power

273
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,640
in the battle of Que City.

274
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,840
Aren't you afraid

275
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,040
that he'll be involved in

276
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,440
and you'll be slandered?

277
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,840
Master.

278
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,240
I don't believe that

279
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,440
Xiao Jue will order

280
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,040
Shui Yan and Que City

281
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,440
to win the battle easily.

282
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,440
He won't even

283
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,840
let the whole city

284
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,840
be destroyed.

285
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,640
I don't believe that

286
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,840
Xiao Jue will order

287
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,840
Shui Yan and Que City

288
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,840
to win the battle easily.

289
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,840
He won't even

290
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,840
let the whole city

291
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
be destroyed.

292
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,840
But he still wants to

293
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,640
let the whole city

294
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,840
be the stepping stone

295
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,840
and pave the way for his great power.

296
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,840
Most importantly,

297
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,840
Xiao Jue

298
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,040
needs to add talents now.

299
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,840
I can

300
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
be the head and feet

301
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,840
and prove myself.

302
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,840
Hansheng Gou is so busy.

303
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,840
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

304
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,840
Brother He, why are you so early?

305
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
Don't wake up.

306
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,840
Head of the Shen family.

307
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,840
Head of the Shen family.

308
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,840
You bastard.

309
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,840
Head of the Shen family.

310
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
Good morning, Commander.

311
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,840
Good morning, Commander.

312
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
You're up early.

313
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,840
Commander, he was woken up.

314
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,840
Everyone, gather at the fire station immediately.

315
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,840
Everyone, go around the camp and run ten laps.

316
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,840
You can't burn a single lap.

317
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,840
No, ten laps.

318
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
Why?

319
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,840
Just because of you.

320
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,840
General, you're in a hurry.

321
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,840
There's no one in the whole family.

322
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,840
A filial person.

323
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,840
A filial person.

324
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,840
If you want to sleep, go home and sleep.

325
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,840
This is the camp.

326
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,840
The camp.

327
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,840
Brother, brother.

328
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,840
If you don't go out later, it will be worse.

329
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
No, no.

330
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
No.

331
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,840
Brother He, I'm so scared.

332
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,840
I can't keep up with the training.

333
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,840
It's okay.

334
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,840
The training of new soldiers is in progress.

335
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,840
The first day won't be too tiring.

336
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,840
I can't move.

337
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,840
I can't move.

338
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,840
I can't move.

339
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,840
I can't move.

340
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,840
I can't move.

341
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,840
I can't move.

342
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
Stand up.

343
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,840
Five laps left.

344
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
Come on, brother He.

345
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,840
Count one, two, three.

346
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,840
Two, three.

347
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,840
Be careful.

348
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,840
One, two, three.

349
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,840
I don't know how to train soldiers in the past.

350
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,840
Now I finally see it.

351
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,840
It's so fierce as soon as you come up.

352
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,840
This filial man has a beautiful face.

353
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
But he's really a cruel person.

354
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,840
Just like before.

355
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,840
I still want to make a military achievement.

356
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,840
But filial people are not only cruel to others,

357
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,840
but also to the people around them.

358
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,840
I want to make a military achievement.

359
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,840
But filial people are not only cruel to others,

360
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,840
but also to themselves.

361
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,840
It seems that it's not that easy to kill me

362
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,840
under his watchful eyes.

363
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,840
I'm badly injured and poisoned.

364
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,840
I've been lying for more than a month.

365
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,840
It almost burned my nose.

366
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
It won't work if it goes on like this.

367
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,840
Duoduo, this is only the first day.

368
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,840
Will you be too cruel?

369
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,840
Instructor Shen, these new soldiers

370
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,840
are not mountain villagers,

371
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
but bandits.

372
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
Just like that horse.

373
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,840
Your Duoduo's thunderous tactics

374
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,840
are not only to put them in danger,

375
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,840
but also to see their potential.

376
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,840
Childe Cheng knows our Duoduo well.

377
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,840
Isn't this the horse-riding horse yesterday?

378
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,840
Why are the others already in the seventh circle?

379
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,840
He's just starting the fourth circle.

380
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,840
I think this person is still a little inferior.

381
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
Don't say that about my savior.

382
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
What's wrong with inferiority?

383
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,840
It's good to be a fire-throwing soldier

384
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,840
in case of good skills.

385
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,840
Fire-throwing soldier?

386
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
You're too narrow-minded.

387
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,840
I think this person is a good talent

388
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,840
after being in the position.

389
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,840
Next, we'll start training all kinds of weapons.

390
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,840
Brother A'Hen,

391
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,840
why is this knife so small?

392
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
It's not even as long as my arm.

393
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:48,440
This is a

394
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:19,840
This is a good one.

395
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,840
This should be a trick, too.

396
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,840
You can't even hit it.

397
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
I'm so tired.

398
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,840
Good.

399
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,840
This is called a trick.

400
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,840
This is called a trick.

401
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,840
This is a trick.

402
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,840
You're so good.

403
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,840
You're so good.

404
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,840
I'll get up.

405
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,840
You're so good.

406
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,840
You're so good.

407
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,840
You're so good.

408
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,840
Great.

409
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,840
Great.

410
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,840
Great.

411
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,840
Great.

412
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,840
It's your turn.

413
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,840
Hurry up.

414
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,840
Hurry up.

415
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,840
Hurry up.

416
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,840
Hurry up.

417
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,840
Hurry up.

418
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,840
Pull it.

419
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,840
You're the one.

420
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,840
No need.

421
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,840
I can't pull this bow.

422
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,840
This bow really needs some effort.

423
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,840
You can't blame He Yan.

424
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,840
Brother A'Hen,

425
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,840
no matter what he does,

426
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,840
we have to work harder.

427
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,840
Hurry up.

428
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
Pull.

429
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,840
Pull.

430
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,840
Again.

431
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,840
Pull.

432
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
Stop.

433
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,840
Pull.

434
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,840
Hand.

435
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,840
Again.

436
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,840
Pull.

437
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,840
Pull.

438
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
Pull.

439
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,840
Pull.

440
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,840
Pull.

441
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
What are you laughing at?

442
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,840
Pick it up!

443
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,640
Continue!

444
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,440
The embroidery is beautiful,

445
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,640
but it's not useful.

446
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,640
Go!

447
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,640
Go!

448
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
No matter what,

449
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,240
he picked up the gun.

450
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,640
There's still something to be done.

451
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
What do you mean?

452
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:51,840
I mean,

453
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
he picked up the gun.

454
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
He's not a thief.

455
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,440
He's a thief.

456
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,040
How's He Yan's life?

457
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,640
He Yan was born in a family of Jiazhou people.

458
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,240
He didn't join the army.

459
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,640
There's no suspicious person in his family.

460
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,040
At present,

461
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,640
he has no problem with his origin.

462
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,640
He's good at horse-horses.

463
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,440
He's familiar with the rules of the military camp.

464
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,840
He's obviously a man of the army.

465
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,440
But in the Japanese army,

466
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,240
he's just a useless man.

467
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,840
I'm really curious.

468
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,240
He's a useless man.

469
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,240
He's really bad.

470
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,840
Where are the others?

471
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,040
Commander Hui,

472
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,040
there are many new soldiers.

473
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,840
Many of them are innocent.

474
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,440
But only one of them

475
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,040
dares to make a fool of the military.

476
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,440
Two groups of people are coming from Ming Shui.

477
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,640
One group is going to Jiazhou.

478
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,640
The other group is going to Xue City.

479
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,640
We'll find out who's the one who made the mistake.

480
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,440
The rest of you

481
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,240
will continue to investigate Ming Shui.

482
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,640
Yes, sir.

483
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,240
Ming Shui.

484
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,640
Ming Shui.

485
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,640
Ming Shui.

486
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,640
Ming Shui.

487
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,640
Ming Shui.

488
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,640
Ming Shui.

489
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,640
Ming Shui.

490
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,640
Ming Shui.

491
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,640
Ming Shui.

492
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,640
Ming Shui.

493
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,640
Ming Shui.

494
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,640
Ming Shui.

495
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,640
Ming Shui.

496
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,640
Ming Shui.

497
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,640
Ming Shui.

498
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,640
Ming Shui.

499
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,640
Ming Shui.

500
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,640
Ming Shui.

501
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,640
Ming Shui.

502
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,640
Ming Shui.

503
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,640
Ming Shui.

504
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,640
Ming Shui.

505
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,640
Ming Shui.

506
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,640
Ming Shui.

507
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,640
Ming Shui.

508
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,640
Ming Shui.

509
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,640
Ming Shui.

510
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,640
Ming Shui.

511
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,640
What's that smell?

512
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,840
It seems to be from the mountain.

513
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,440
The smell of sulfur.

514
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,440
Who found a hot spring?

515
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,520
Mr. Hong.

516
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,840
What are you doing?

517
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,240
Go.

518
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,260
Wait.

519
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,140
You too?

520
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,640
Yes.

521
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,940
After this,

522
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840
we should all go back.

523
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,840
Brother.

524
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,640
Chang Lang.

525
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,640
I used pain and blood to change them.

526
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,240
He's the legitimate heir.

527
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,440
It's just a few words.

528
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,240
It's mine.

529
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,240
You can't take it.

530
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,240
It's just a few words.

531
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,840
But it's like a poem.

532
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:24,480
In my last life, I was so

533
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,440
With the training,

534
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,840
I think I'll be back in a few days.

535
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,240
I'll be back in a few days.

536
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,840
I'll be back in a few days.

537
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,040
I've seen mountains and rivers,

538
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,640
and climbed over the ice and frost.

539
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,240
Day and night, I'm alone in my bed.

540
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,040
My mission is to believe

541
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,640
in the ideal I love.

542
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,840
I'll light up the night wind.

543
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,240
I dare not to look up at the sky,

544
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,840
but I'm lost in my dream.

545
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,440
Who cares about the wildness?

546
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,640
I'll go through all the hardships,

547
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,640
and fight my way through life.

548
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,840
Flying in the world,

549
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,640
there's always a desire.

550
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
I'll overcome all the wounds,

551
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,240
and search for the light.

552
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,640
I'll chase after the light in the starry sea.

553
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,640
Unleash the wound, and point it at you.

554
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,640
The courage to return to the light,

555
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,640
is the courage to exist.

556
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,840
I'll chase after the light in the starry sea.

557
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,040
The courage to return to the light,

558
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,840
is the courage to exist.

559
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,440
You've met me,

560
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,500
and let go of the

561
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,240
courage to look at you.

562
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,440
The unwavering love,

563
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,840
you've built for me.
