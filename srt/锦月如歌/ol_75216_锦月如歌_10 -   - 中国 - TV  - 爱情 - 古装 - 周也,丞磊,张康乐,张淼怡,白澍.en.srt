23
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,224
What a skilled martial artist.

24
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,880
He actually killed Ding Yi,

25
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,096
who is He Rufei's

26
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:12,415
right-hand man.

27
00:02:13,064 --> 00:02:13,855
Young Master.

28
00:02:14,376 --> 00:02:15,855
What do we do about the bodies?

29
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:18,255
Sun Xiangfu is a wolf in lamb's skin.

30
00:02:18,408 --> 00:02:19,295
His son Sun Ling

31
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:20,415
is a total animal

32
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:21,936
who abducts women,

33
00:02:22,496 --> 00:02:23,255
assaults them,

34
00:02:23,304 --> 00:02:24,336
and then kills them.

35
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,496
Death is too merciful for him.

36
00:02:29,032 --> 00:02:30,255
We're here to get the ledgers

37
00:02:30,695 --> 00:02:32,056
for the Chancellor.

38
00:02:32,616 --> 00:02:34,376
As for those murder victims,

39
00:02:34,936 --> 00:02:35,735
I bet Xiao Jue

40
00:02:35,975 --> 00:02:37,135
will do them justice.

41
00:02:37,736 --> 00:02:39,176
We just need to bide our time

42
00:02:39,432 --> 00:02:40,456
amid the chaos.

43
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:47,496
Yingxiang.

44
00:02:48,575 --> 00:02:49,695
After all these years,

45
00:02:49,815 --> 00:02:50,735
you should know

46
00:02:50,975 --> 00:02:52,015
that I stop at nothing

47
00:02:52,376 --> 00:02:53,535
to achieve my goals.

48
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:55,456
Compassion

49
00:02:58,415 --> 00:02:59,255
is never my thing.

50
00:03:04,136 --> 00:03:04,855
But Young Master,

51
00:03:05,128 --> 00:03:05,735
you...

52
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:06,575
I willingly chose

53
00:03:06,616 --> 00:03:07,496
this path myself.

54
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:09,456
Why bother finding

55
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,015
high-sounding excuses to justify it?

56
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:16,015
Commander.

57
00:03:16,776 --> 00:03:18,415
I saw many posters

58
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:19,656
of missing persons.

59
00:03:20,376 --> 00:03:21,656
They were all women.

60
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:23,015
I bet

61
00:03:23,112 --> 00:03:24,295
it has something to do

62
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,255
with the bodies in the courtyard.

63
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:28,176
According to Ding Yi,

64
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,456
the forbidden shrine

65
00:03:30,815 --> 00:03:31,975
was meant to suppress

66
00:03:32,376 --> 00:03:33,896
the vengeful spirits of the victims.

67
00:03:38,664 --> 00:03:39,896
Sun Xiangfu and Sun Ling

68
00:03:40,695 --> 00:03:41,815
wanted to deny them peace

69
00:03:41,815 --> 00:03:42,815
even in death.

70
00:03:48,168 --> 00:03:49,015
Commander.

71
00:03:49,735 --> 00:03:50,776
We must bring justice

72
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:51,815
to these

73
00:03:52,176 --> 00:03:53,135
murder victims.

74
00:03:57,815 --> 00:03:58,496
For something

75
00:03:58,496 --> 00:03:59,535
irreversible like this,

76
00:04:00,296 --> 00:04:01,496
it makes little difference

77
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:02,855
to handle it

78
00:04:03,735 --> 00:04:04,575
earlier or later.

79
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:06,456
We should prioritize

80
00:04:06,456 --> 00:04:07,616
the provisions and funds.

81
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,535
But there is a difference.

82
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:11,056
The sooner

83
00:04:11,456 --> 00:04:12,656
we look into it, the sooner

84
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:14,015
we bring peace

85
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:15,056
to the victims

86
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:16,328
and prevent others

87
00:04:16,328 --> 00:04:17,256
from falling victim.

88
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:22,576
Commander.

89
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:24,696
Should we really ignore this

90
00:04:25,216 --> 00:04:26,016
to secure the funds

91
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:27,136
and provisions?

92
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,696
Or do you think

93
00:04:36,904 --> 00:04:38,336
these victims are women

94
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:40,735
that this society disregards,

95
00:04:41,096 --> 00:04:42,535
so they don't deserve attention?

96
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:45,295
I have my plan.

97
00:04:46,175 --> 00:04:47,016
I don't need to

98
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:49,336
explain anything to you.

99
00:05:32,072 --> 00:05:32,776
(These pills)

100
00:05:32,776 --> 00:05:33,776
(can stop bleeding.)

101
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:35,055
(Take three.)

102
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,935
(Rest in your room.)

103
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:41,216
Trying to pay me off like this?

104
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:42,935
Since you won't help,

105
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,656
I'll do it my way.

106
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,358
(Notice)

107
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:18,295
He Yan?

108
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:19,975
Commander.

109
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:20,855
I met He Yan

110
00:06:20,855 --> 00:06:21,896
while investigating

111
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,495
the missing women.

112
00:06:28,735 --> 00:06:29,256
It's fine.

113
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,136
Any news from the capital?

114
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:32,232
Yes.

115
00:06:32,535 --> 00:06:33,415
He Rufei has been

116
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:35,216
eagerly currying favor with Xu Jingfu,

117
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:37,136
who keeps ignoring him.

118
00:06:46,935 --> 00:06:48,735
It probably started a long time ago.

119
00:06:49,656 --> 00:06:50,495
So I was wrong

120
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:51,495
about him back then.

121
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:53,016
He came late

122
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:54,375
to the Mingshui Battle.

123
00:06:55,935 --> 00:06:56,535
I bet he was

124
00:06:56,535 --> 00:06:57,456
already colluding

125
00:06:57,576 --> 00:06:58,615
with Xu Jingfu.

126
00:07:00,816 --> 00:07:02,256
Sending assassins after me

127
00:07:03,528 --> 00:07:04,696
is probably another way

128
00:07:04,735 --> 00:07:06,216
of pledging allegiance.

129
00:07:07,256 --> 00:07:08,576
We must kill him.

130
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,816
I'm acquainted

131
00:07:27,096 --> 00:07:28,096
with He Rufei,

132
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:29,816
but...

133
00:07:38,408 --> 00:07:39,656
How's it going

134
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,216
with the plan?

135
00:07:41,735 --> 00:07:42,535
All set.

136
00:07:43,855 --> 00:07:45,096
Ding Yi vanished.

137
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:46,576
Sun Xiangfu

138
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,415
is surely restless.

139
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,096
It's time

140
00:07:51,935 --> 00:07:53,456
to put on the show.

141
00:07:54,816 --> 00:07:55,336
Ding Yi?

142
00:07:56,295 --> 00:07:57,256
I haven't seen him.

143
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:58,656
Why are you

144
00:07:58,855 --> 00:07:59,776
looking for him?

145
00:08:00,256 --> 00:08:01,096
I'll tell him

146
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:02,175
if I see him.

147
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,375
It's nothing

148
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,495
particularly urgent.

149
00:08:09,776 --> 00:08:11,375
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

150
00:08:14,735 --> 00:08:15,216
See you

151
00:08:15,256 --> 00:08:16,256
in the dining hall.

152
00:08:18,776 --> 00:08:19,456
Yingxiang,

153
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:20,735
keep an eye on him.

154
00:08:21,136 --> 00:08:22,656
He failed to kill Xiao Jue.

155
00:08:23,175 --> 00:08:24,136
And Ding Yi vanished.

156
00:08:24,456 --> 00:08:25,256
He must be

157
00:08:25,535 --> 00:08:26,256
restless.

158
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:27,535
His life

159
00:08:27,816 --> 00:08:29,216
depends on those ledgers.

160
00:08:29,696 --> 00:08:30,935
He'll guard them carefully.

161
00:08:31,855 --> 00:08:32,456
Also,

162
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:34,096
if you find the ledgers,

163
00:08:34,456 --> 00:08:35,576
lay low to avoid

164
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,096
causing commotion.

165
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,135
Understood.

166
00:08:51,975 --> 00:08:53,015
Stop eating.

167
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:55,216
The guests haven't even arrived.

168
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:56,056
Father.

169
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,855
You're so rude.

170
00:08:58,696 --> 00:08:59,536
As the saying goes,

171
00:08:59,696 --> 00:09:00,655
"Appetite and lust

172
00:09:00,655 --> 00:09:01,536
are human nature."

173
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,775
Are you defying the sages?

174
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:05,056
You...

175
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:07,375
Mr. Chu,

176
00:09:07,936 --> 00:09:09,135
pardon his poor manners.

177
00:09:11,576 --> 00:09:12,176
Commander Xiao.

178
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:13,216
Mr. Cheng.

179
00:09:17,768 --> 00:09:18,536
Commander Xiao.

180
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:19,255
Mr. Cheng.

181
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,015
I've been waiting for you.

182
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:22,775
Please be seated.

183
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:23,655
Go ahead.

184
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:33,375
What an extravagant feast.

185
00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:35,936
Uncle,

186
00:09:36,495 --> 00:09:38,375
you should learn from Mr. Sun

187
00:09:38,975 --> 00:09:39,975
and be more generous.

188
00:09:40,264 --> 00:09:42,176
Stop being so stingy with me

189
00:09:42,576 --> 00:09:43,456
or mistreating me.

190
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:45,775
Mr. Cheng,

191
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:48,255
have your eyes recovered?

192
00:09:48,895 --> 00:09:49,576
That's right.

193
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:51,336
The Chief Imperial Physician

194
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:52,416
is my master.

195
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:53,416
I can deal with

196
00:09:53,735 --> 00:09:54,456
petty toxins.

197
00:10:01,056 --> 00:10:01,735
I recovered

198
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:03,056
that very night.

199
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:06,255
Then why did you

200
00:10:06,735 --> 00:10:07,296
waste all our

201
00:10:07,336 --> 00:10:08,015
precious herb...?

202
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:08,584
You brat!

203
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:11,255
- Come on.
- Can you...

204
00:10:11,495 --> 00:10:12,336
- What's wrong?
- Stop...

205
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:13,296
Talking...

206
00:10:13,296 --> 00:10:13,816
Father.

207
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:14,344
Please?

208
00:10:17,735 --> 00:10:18,375
Sure.

209
00:10:25,096 --> 00:10:25,855
Sorry, Commander.

210
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,816
I've spoiled my son.

211
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:29,056
He spouts nonsense.

212
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:31,255
It's okay.

213
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:32,655
In fact,

214
00:10:32,895 --> 00:10:34,375
I should apologize to you.

215
00:10:35,775 --> 00:10:36,336
My nephew

216
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,576
has always been wayward.

217
00:10:37,975 --> 00:10:39,375
He's led a sheltered life,

218
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,176
so this assassination

219
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:42,735
left him traumatized.

220
00:10:43,495 --> 00:10:45,456
He feared further attacks

221
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,336
and pretended to be blind.

222
00:10:48,712 --> 00:10:49,975
I almost got deceived, too.

223
00:10:52,495 --> 00:10:53,176
It's alright.

224
00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:54,895
In fact,

225
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,855
it's rather interesting that Mr. Cheng

226
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,536
pretended to be blind.

227
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:00,424
Really?

228
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:01,096
Totally.

229
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:01,735
I think so.

230
00:11:01,735 --> 00:11:02,576
Exactly.

231
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:07,375
The dishes are turning cold.

232
00:11:07,655 --> 00:11:08,416
Let's eat.

233
00:11:09,895 --> 00:11:10,655
I've heard

234
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:12,176
about the poor harvest

235
00:11:12,176 --> 00:11:13,056
and that the farmers

236
00:11:13,895 --> 00:11:15,296
are all behind on payments.

237
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,416
But the previous banquet

238
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:19,216
and this luncheon

239
00:11:20,015 --> 00:11:21,495
are both exceptionally lavish.

240
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:23,975
There is no sign

241
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:25,336
of a famine.

242
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:27,336
Or perhaps,

243
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,735
Mr. Sun enjoys heavenly favor,

244
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:32,255
where only your household

245
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:33,735
receives favorable weather?

246
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:36,216
I must

247
00:11:36,615 --> 00:11:37,936
thank Heaven.

248
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,975
The famine does exist,

249
00:11:45,936 --> 00:11:46,735
but

250
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:48,855
it's improved significantly.

251
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:50,336
In that case,

252
00:11:51,015 --> 00:11:52,456
let's discuss military funds.

253
00:11:59,096 --> 00:12:00,576
The Yezhou merchants

254
00:12:01,176 --> 00:12:02,615
delay tax payments every year.

255
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:05,336
That's outrageous.

256
00:12:06,255 --> 00:12:06,816
Well,

257
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,576
Mr. Sun,

258
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:10,015
bring out the tax ledger

259
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:10,936
and show me

260
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:12,096
their names.

261
00:12:19,816 --> 00:12:20,456
Commander,

262
00:12:20,536 --> 00:12:22,375
I don't think that's appropriate.

263
00:12:26,135 --> 00:12:28,015
You have shown such hospitality.

264
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,096
I merely wish

265
00:12:29,576 --> 00:12:30,816
to return the favor.

266
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:32,096
I truly appreciate it.

267
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:32,855
Well,

268
00:12:33,615 --> 00:12:34,855
I won't make it hard for you.

269
00:12:35,495 --> 00:12:36,056
Mr. Sun,

270
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:37,655
give me the names

271
00:12:37,936 --> 00:12:39,495
of the tax-evading merchants.

272
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:40,655
I'll host

273
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,336
a gathering tomorrow

274
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:43,456
to give them

275
00:12:44,255 --> 00:12:45,375
a warning on your behalf.

276
00:12:47,816 --> 00:12:48,816
That's inappropriate.

277
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:49,975
- Those...
- Mr. Sun.

278
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:52,696
My uncle kindly offered help.

279
00:12:52,936 --> 00:12:54,056
Show some appreciation.

280
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:55,975
Even if you can wait,

281
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,375
the Yezhou Garrison

282
00:12:57,536 --> 00:12:58,576
is in dire need

283
00:12:58,615 --> 00:13:00,216
of provisions and funds.

284
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,296
Mr. Cheng...

285
00:13:01,296 --> 00:13:01,895
Mr. Sun.

286
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:03,255
Commander Xiao

287
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,735
meant to help.

288
00:13:05,015 --> 00:13:06,456
Please accept his goodwill.

289
00:13:14,216 --> 00:13:14,895
Then

290
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:18,056
thank you, Commander.

291
00:13:20,576 --> 00:13:21,135
Mr. Chu,

292
00:13:21,615 --> 00:13:22,536
would you honor us

293
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:23,615
with your presence?

294
00:13:24,296 --> 00:13:25,255
Since you asked,

295
00:13:25,775 --> 00:13:27,096
how could I say no?

296
00:13:38,176 --> 00:13:39,135
Why did you tell them

297
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:40,336
that you can see now?

298
00:13:41,735 --> 00:13:43,015
I was helping you.

299
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:46,975
Helping me?

300
00:13:47,735 --> 00:13:48,375
Yeah.

301
00:13:48,855 --> 00:13:50,536
To intimidate the Suns

302
00:13:50,775 --> 00:13:51,735
so that you can

303
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:52,816
carry out your plan.

304
00:13:54,895 --> 00:13:55,576
I know

305
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:57,176
you care about

306
00:13:57,224 --> 00:13:58,696
those victims.

307
00:13:59,255 --> 00:13:59,936
Therefore,

308
00:13:59,936 --> 00:14:01,296
I must help you

309
00:14:01,296 --> 00:14:02,135
with the plan.

310
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,536
So you're not mad at me

311
00:14:05,032 --> 00:14:06,440
because you know my plan?

312
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:11,296
I, He Yan,

313
00:14:11,655 --> 00:14:13,015
thank you on behalf

314
00:14:13,696 --> 00:14:14,895
of those victims.

315
00:14:39,624 --> 00:14:41,171
(Tax Ledger)

316
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:45,816
So what if you meet them?

317
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:48,296
I have dirt on these merchants.

318
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,336
They're under my control.

319
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,936
Let's see who dares

320
00:14:54,216 --> 00:14:55,895
to speak against me in Yezhou.

321
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:03,576
Did you see how he opened

322
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:05,135
that cabinet?

323
00:15:06,056 --> 00:15:06,655
Yes, I did.

324
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:07,855
Actually,

325
00:15:08,015 --> 00:15:09,456
we should thank Xiao Jue.

326
00:15:09,655 --> 00:15:11,096
He asked for that list

327
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,775
and gave us a chance.

328
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:14,975
Young Master.

329
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:17,296
Sun Ling's bedroom is guarded.

330
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:18,255
I could

331
00:15:18,336 --> 00:15:19,855
sneak in unnoticed,

332
00:15:20,495 --> 00:15:22,135
but the noise of opening the cabinet

333
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:24,255
would surely alert the guards.

334
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:25,255
Therefore,

335
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:26,895
to retrieve the ledgers,

336
00:15:27,096 --> 00:15:27,895
we must draw

337
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:29,056
those guards away.

338
00:15:31,216 --> 00:15:33,096
Xiao Jue is staging a show tomorrow.

339
00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:34,655
Surely, he'll be prepared.

340
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,416
Once his men subdue the guards,

341
00:15:38,576 --> 00:15:39,615
that'll be your chance

342
00:15:39,696 --> 00:15:40,615
to get the ledgers.

343
00:15:43,696 --> 00:15:44,336
Young Master.

344
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:45,495
This is a trap.

345
00:15:46,015 --> 00:15:47,576
Only Sun Xiangfu would believe

346
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:48,576
that Xiao Jue genuinely

347
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:49,576
wanted to help him.

348
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,735
Why are you attending the feast?

349
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,655
When Xiao Jue takes action,

350
00:15:53,895 --> 00:15:55,056
Sun Xiangfu will try

351
00:15:55,176 --> 00:15:56,775
to drag you down to save himself.

352
00:15:57,735 --> 00:15:58,536
Would it stop him

353
00:15:59,135 --> 00:16:00,655
from implicating me if I don't go?

354
00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:03,096
So I must go.

355
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:04,015
I am

356
00:16:04,015 --> 00:16:05,336
the inspector.

357
00:16:05,816 --> 00:16:06,895
No matter what happens,

358
00:16:07,456 --> 00:16:08,536
I can intervene.

359
00:16:09,855 --> 00:16:10,536
However,

360
00:16:11,615 --> 00:16:13,416
Sun Xiangfu must be taken out

361
00:16:13,936 --> 00:16:15,216
to prevent complications.

362
00:16:16,015 --> 00:16:16,576
If he exposes

363
00:16:16,615 --> 00:16:17,775
his dealings with Master,

364
00:16:18,096 --> 00:16:18,816
then it would

365
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:20,375
put me in trouble.

366
00:16:20,975 --> 00:16:21,735
Rest assured.

367
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,416
I'll make sure

368
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,735
you face no future troubles.

369
00:16:45,216 --> 00:16:46,015
Gentlemen,

370
00:16:46,735 --> 00:16:47,936
why aren't you eating?

371
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,056
The food is nice.

372
00:16:52,975 --> 00:16:54,255
Why isn't anyone eating?

373
00:16:54,775 --> 00:16:55,336
Gentlemen.

374
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:56,216
The rice

375
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:57,816
comes from the hard work

376
00:16:58,176 --> 00:16:59,615
of the Yezhou people.

377
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:00,576
These greens

378
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,096
also come from

379
00:17:02,296 --> 00:17:03,615
their diligent labor.

380
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:04,736
Gentlemen,

381
00:17:05,096 --> 00:17:06,472
why aren't you eating?

382
00:17:20,736 --> 00:17:21,375
Huaijin.

383
00:17:21,816 --> 00:17:22,615
I think

384
00:17:23,096 --> 00:17:25,096
these gentlemen might be

385
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,976
overwhelmed by the tax collection

386
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,695
and couldn't eat.

387
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:32,576
Mr. Cheng is right.

388
00:17:33,976 --> 00:17:34,496
Dig in.

389
00:17:34,976 --> 00:17:35,536
Dig in.

390
00:17:47,056 --> 00:17:49,375
You seriously have no appetite?

391
00:17:50,056 --> 00:17:51,976
I know things are hard for you,

392
00:17:52,576 --> 00:17:53,215
but

393
00:17:54,415 --> 00:17:56,056
Commander Xiao doesn't.

394
00:17:56,296 --> 00:17:57,415
You must

395
00:17:57,448 --> 00:17:58,976
voice your concerns.

396
00:17:59,056 --> 00:18:00,655
Only then can he understand.

397
00:18:05,016 --> 00:18:06,215
Mr. Sun makes

398
00:18:07,256 --> 00:18:08,296
a fair point.

399
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:10,816
Your wisdom prevails.

400
00:18:11,576 --> 00:18:12,175
Gentlemen,

401
00:18:12,895 --> 00:18:13,928
don't hold back.

402
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:16,336
Tell me all about

403
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,056
your troubles.

404
00:18:21,096 --> 00:18:21,655
I...

405
00:18:33,352 --> 00:18:34,855
Everyone's too serious.

406
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:36,855
No one wishes to speak.

407
00:18:37,736 --> 00:18:38,536
Why don't we

408
00:18:38,736 --> 00:18:40,016
go for a walk?

409
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:41,256
I happen to know

410
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:42,655
a unique

411
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,776
scenic spot within the Sun Mansion.

412
00:18:45,576 --> 00:18:46,296
Shall we

413
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,655
invite them to join us?

414
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:50,536
Great idea.

415
00:19:01,655 --> 00:19:02,336
Gentlemen.

416
00:19:02,895 --> 00:19:04,576
Commander Xiao doesn't like to wait.

417
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:06,536
Shall we?

418
00:19:17,776 --> 00:19:18,375
Shall we?

419
00:19:19,655 --> 00:19:20,215
Let's go.

420
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:24,615
Mr. Chu.

421
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:26,895
- I...
- The great scenic spot

422
00:19:27,592 --> 00:19:28,424
is certainly

423
00:19:29,455 --> 00:19:30,496
not to be missed.

424
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:49,256
My sweetie.

425
00:19:49,776 --> 00:19:51,215
My sweetie.

426
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,336
My sweet girl.

427
00:19:52,336 --> 00:19:53,296
My child.

428
00:19:53,832 --> 00:19:57,135
Who did this to you?

429
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:04,215
Tell me, sweetie.

430
00:20:04,215 --> 00:20:04,776
What...

431
00:20:06,256 --> 00:20:07,736
What's going on?

432
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:09,976
What's going on?

433
00:20:10,816 --> 00:20:12,256
You should ask Mr. Sun

434
00:20:12,736 --> 00:20:13,816
and Young Master Sun.

435
00:20:16,328 --> 00:20:16,935
Well...

436
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:17,655
Well...

437
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:18,736
I...

438
00:20:18,895 --> 00:20:20,135
What's with the stuttering?

439
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,175
Calm down.

440
00:20:22,776 --> 00:20:24,175
What does it have to do with us?

441
00:20:24,336 --> 00:20:25,336
Learn from me.

442
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:26,496
Stay calm.

443
00:20:29,056 --> 00:20:30,135
None of our business.

444
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,655
Sun Xiangfu.

445
00:20:38,816 --> 00:20:39,375
My daughter.

446
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:40,175
What?

447
00:20:40,336 --> 00:20:41,175
Why...

448
00:20:41,576 --> 00:20:42,175
Why...

449
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,256
is my daughter
found dead in your mansion?

450
00:20:44,935 --> 00:20:47,375
Why is my daughter
found dead in your mansion?

451
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,736
How should I know?

452
00:20:49,576 --> 00:20:50,375
You should ask

453
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,776
Commander Xiao and Mr. Cheng.

454
00:20:53,455 --> 00:20:54,496
Why did they bring us

455
00:20:54,496 --> 00:20:55,895
to this long-abandoned place?

456
00:20:56,016 --> 00:20:56,736
And why did they

457
00:20:56,776 --> 00:20:57,776
gather these corpses

458
00:20:57,896 --> 00:20:58,776
to show us?

459
00:20:58,895 --> 00:20:59,816
What do they want?

460
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:01,056
What do we want?

461
00:21:02,536 --> 00:21:04,256
We're at your mansion.

462
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:06,576
So the one who buried these remains

463
00:21:07,056 --> 00:21:08,424
must be from your household.

464
00:21:08,904 --> 00:21:10,016
Twelve bodies.

465
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:10,895
That is

466
00:21:11,175 --> 00:21:13,135
exactly the number of missing women.

467
00:21:14,135 --> 00:21:15,976
Sun Ling abducted innocent women,

468
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,215
violated them,

469
00:21:18,175 --> 00:21:19,935
brutally murdered them,

470
00:21:20,816 --> 00:21:22,215
and buried them here.

471
00:21:23,096 --> 00:21:24,056
And Sun Xiangfu

472
00:21:24,336 --> 00:21:25,455
abused his authority

473
00:21:26,175 --> 00:21:27,296
to cover up

474
00:21:28,056 --> 00:21:29,215
the heinous crimes.

475
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:31,455
They should be executed.

476
00:21:33,695 --> 00:21:34,695
Commander, Mr. Cheng.

477
00:21:35,056 --> 00:21:36,375
Do you have evidence?

478
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,096
You can't just make

479
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:39,256
false accusations

480
00:21:39,496 --> 00:21:40,576
against us as you wish.

481
00:21:40,776 --> 00:21:41,336
Exactly.

482
00:21:42,895 --> 00:21:43,536
Mr. Chu,

483
00:21:44,695 --> 00:21:46,336
as a minister sent from the capital,

484
00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:48,135
you can tell right from wrong.

485
00:21:49,096 --> 00:21:50,615
Commander Xiao

486
00:21:50,655 --> 00:21:51,215
and Mr. Cheng

487
00:21:51,455 --> 00:21:52,135
are clearly

488
00:21:52,135 --> 00:21:53,296
holding grudges against me

489
00:21:53,415 --> 00:21:54,816
due to the provisions and funds.

490
00:21:54,976 --> 00:21:56,536
So they are

491
00:21:56,695 --> 00:21:58,175
blaming the murders on us.

492
00:21:58,175 --> 00:21:58,615
Exactly.

493
00:21:59,655 --> 00:22:00,375
Mr. Chu,

494
00:22:01,736 --> 00:22:02,415
you also think

495
00:22:03,215 --> 00:22:04,215
that I'm framing them?

496
00:22:06,455 --> 00:22:07,736
Of course, I trust you

497
00:22:08,056 --> 00:22:09,056
and Mr. Cheng.

498
00:22:09,576 --> 00:22:10,215
But

499
00:22:10,695 --> 00:22:11,615
these bodies alone

500
00:22:11,935 --> 00:22:12,895
don't prove anything.

501
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:14,496
We need

502
00:22:15,256 --> 00:22:16,455
solid evidence.

503
00:22:16,655 --> 00:22:17,336
Exactly.

504
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,455
Evidence is crucial.

505
00:22:19,655 --> 00:22:21,736
Mr. Chu proves to be a wise man.

506
00:22:21,895 --> 00:22:22,776
You heard Mr. Chu?

507
00:22:22,895 --> 00:22:24,415
We need solid proof.

508
00:22:24,816 --> 00:22:25,496
Where is

509
00:22:25,816 --> 00:22:26,536
the evidence...?

510
00:22:26,576 --> 00:22:27,455
I am the evidence.

511
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,215
Who is she?

512
00:22:34,296 --> 00:22:34,816
No idea.

513
00:22:37,215 --> 00:22:38,016
Who is she?

514
00:22:38,695 --> 00:22:39,536
No idea.

515
00:22:54,215 --> 00:22:55,736
I am the daughter of the Chief

516
00:22:55,736 --> 00:22:56,615
Imperial Physician,

517
00:22:56,736 --> 00:22:57,536
Song Taotao.

518
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,215
I was abducted by Sun Ling

519
00:22:59,432 --> 00:23:01,016
the moment I arrived in Yezhou.

520
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,096
Everyone

521
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:03,655
at the inn that day

522
00:23:03,736 --> 00:23:04,655
can testify to that.

523
00:23:05,215 --> 00:23:07,215
Had Mr. Cheng not intervened,

524
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,576
I would be

525
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:09,736
the thirteenth corpse.

526
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,256
Father.

527
00:23:12,816 --> 00:23:13,496
Shut up.

528
00:23:17,032 --> 00:23:18,215
That's not true, Mr. Chu.

529
00:23:20,135 --> 00:23:21,375
Commander Xiao, Mr. Cheng.

530
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,455
I know

531
00:23:22,496 --> 00:23:25,256
my son has offended Miss Song.

532
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,256
But you can't make up something

533
00:23:27,415 --> 00:23:28,215
to frame my son

534
00:23:28,215 --> 00:23:29,375
just because of that.

535
00:23:29,496 --> 00:23:30,016
Yeah.

536
00:23:30,096 --> 00:23:31,135
You...

537
00:23:31,175 --> 00:23:32,296
You brat!

538
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,576
It's all your fault.

539
00:23:33,816 --> 00:23:34,336
I...

540
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,296
See? They're seeking revenge on us.

541
00:23:36,935 --> 00:23:38,256
They're attacking us now.

542
00:23:38,472 --> 00:23:39,855
They're slandering us.

543
00:23:39,855 --> 00:23:41,016
They're even

544
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,695
trying to get us killed.

545
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,695
Father, you're absolutely right.

546
00:23:45,768 --> 00:23:47,736
We're innocent.

547
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:52,744
You're innocent?

548
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:56,455
Then what's the story

549
00:23:58,016 --> 00:23:59,336
with these 12 deities?

550
00:24:01,655 --> 00:24:02,776
These 12 statues

551
00:24:03,496 --> 00:24:05,016
suppress 12 vengeful spirits.

552
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:07,336
You committed evil deeds,

553
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:08,855
and expect the deities

554
00:24:08,895 --> 00:24:09,776
to suppress the souls

555
00:24:09,855 --> 00:24:11,215
of these poor women.

556
00:24:12,016 --> 00:24:12,855
What a pair

557
00:24:12,855 --> 00:24:14,496
of "virtuous" father and son.

558
00:24:15,175 --> 00:24:16,215
Justice will prevail.

559
00:24:16,615 --> 00:24:17,296
The deities

560
00:24:17,496 --> 00:24:18,336
would never help

561
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,296
villains like you.

562
00:24:19,736 --> 00:24:20,296
Mr. Cheng,

563
00:24:20,336 --> 00:24:21,615
you're crossing the line.

564
00:24:21,864 --> 00:24:22,455
Yeah.

565
00:24:22,576 --> 00:24:23,895
Who knows what's going on

566
00:24:23,935 --> 00:24:24,695
with the statues?

567
00:24:24,816 --> 00:24:26,096
It could be a coincidence.

568
00:24:26,655 --> 00:24:27,415
Besides,

569
00:24:28,016 --> 00:24:28,816
maybe...

570
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:31,536
the person who planted the corpses here

571
00:24:31,816 --> 00:24:32,455
did this

572
00:24:32,536 --> 00:24:33,175
to frame us.

573
00:24:33,256 --> 00:24:34,135
It's very likely.

574
00:24:34,175 --> 00:24:34,895
Yeah.

575
00:24:35,695 --> 00:24:37,016
To frame you?

576
00:24:38,296 --> 00:24:39,455
These 12 statues

577
00:24:39,935 --> 00:24:40,855
vary in age.

578
00:24:41,935 --> 00:24:42,736
Why don't we

579
00:24:43,056 --> 00:24:44,816
ask the craftsmen

580
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:46,296
who made them

581
00:24:46,655 --> 00:24:47,776
when each statue

582
00:24:48,096 --> 00:24:49,135
was made,

583
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:50,256
and compare

584
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:51,536
the dates with the time

585
00:24:52,056 --> 00:24:53,135
these women died?

586
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:54,096
Yeah.

587
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:57,016
N-No need.

588
00:24:57,336 --> 00:24:58,336
Father, this isn't...

589
00:24:59,135 --> 00:25:00,336
Sun Xiangfu.

590
00:25:00,736 --> 00:25:01,496
So it was

591
00:25:01,895 --> 00:25:03,496
you corrupt official

592
00:25:03,615 --> 00:25:05,895
and your son who killed my daughter.

593
00:25:06,576 --> 00:25:07,536
I wondered

594
00:25:07,855 --> 00:25:10,056
why the case dragged on.

595
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,375
Give me back

596
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:12,415
my daughter!

597
00:25:12,415 --> 00:25:13,032
You filth!

598
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:14,496
Give her back to me!

599
00:25:15,175 --> 00:25:16,016
Rest assured.

600
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,016
Commander Xiao

601
00:25:19,576 --> 00:25:21,296
will surely obtain justice

602
00:25:22,016 --> 00:25:23,736
for your daughters

603
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:25,576
and all other victims.

604
00:25:28,016 --> 00:25:29,096
Commander Xiao,

605
00:25:29,175 --> 00:25:31,736
you must uphold justice for us.

606
00:25:31,935 --> 00:25:32,695
Everyone,

607
00:25:33,496 --> 00:25:34,336
please rise.

608
00:25:35,615 --> 00:25:37,576
I will ensure justice is served.

609
00:25:47,976 --> 00:25:48,536
Why is there

610
00:25:48,615 --> 00:25:50,056
also a male corpse?

611
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:53,736
A-A male corpse?

612
00:26:00,808 --> 00:26:01,695
Isn't he

613
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:03,776
the servant from

614
00:26:03,776 --> 00:26:04,855
the Sun's Mansion?

615
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:05,736
No, I didn't...

616
00:26:10,776 --> 00:26:11,816
He's one of theirs.

617
00:26:11,855 --> 00:26:12,424
Yeah.

618
00:26:12,496 --> 00:26:13,256
I recall seeing him

619
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:15,175
at Wanhua Pavilion

620
00:26:15,736 --> 00:26:17,056
when I first arrived in Yezhou.

621
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,455
He was selecting dancers

622
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:19,296
for the banquet

623
00:26:19,615 --> 00:26:20,855
following

624
00:26:21,256 --> 00:26:22,296
Mr. Sun's orders.

625
00:26:22,536 --> 00:26:23,776
He ended up selecting

626
00:26:24,256 --> 00:26:25,695
a bunch of assassins

627
00:26:25,816 --> 00:26:26,776
who tried to kill me.

628
00:26:27,615 --> 00:26:28,296
Could it be

629
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:30,375
a part of Mr. Sun's order?

630
00:26:36,455 --> 00:26:38,256
What a gruesome way to die.

631
00:26:39,855 --> 00:26:41,175
He's just another pawn.

632
00:26:41,776 --> 00:26:42,736
I wonder

633
00:26:44,695 --> 00:26:45,976
what fate awaits

634
00:26:46,175 --> 00:26:46,935
Mr. Sun?

635
00:26:47,895 --> 00:26:49,175
He deserves to die.

636
00:26:53,175 --> 00:26:53,855
Well.

637
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:55,576
Alright.

638
00:26:56,536 --> 00:26:58,375
I'll show you what fate awaits me.

639
00:26:59,855 --> 00:27:00,935
Just a minute.

640
00:27:05,455 --> 00:27:06,615
W-What is he doing?

641
00:27:06,695 --> 00:27:08,056
You'll find out what fate

642
00:27:08,135 --> 00:27:09,256
awaits me right now!

643
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:10,375
Watch closely.

644
00:27:30,664 --> 00:27:32,832
(Account Book)

645
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:09,496
Try again.

646
00:28:15,176 --> 00:28:16,215
They're here.

647
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:17,135
What should we do?

648
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:18,175
Yeah.

649
00:28:23,336 --> 00:28:23,855
Commander.

650
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:25,855
The guards trying to barge in

651
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:27,455
have been subdued.

652
00:28:27,895 --> 00:28:28,776
Awaiting your command.

653
00:28:29,655 --> 00:28:30,336
Detain them.

654
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:31,855
Understood.

655
00:28:35,688 --> 00:28:36,935
Did you find provisions

656
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:38,855
and funds?

657
00:28:38,952 --> 00:28:39,695
No.

658
00:28:40,096 --> 00:28:41,336
The warehouse is empty.

659
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:47,536
Mr. Sun,

660
00:28:49,296 --> 00:28:50,215
since the merchants

661
00:28:50,455 --> 00:28:51,536
have paid their taxes,

662
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,455
then where are the funds

663
00:28:55,056 --> 00:28:56,256
and provisions

664
00:28:57,128 --> 00:28:58,135
that you have raised?

665
00:28:58,296 --> 00:28:58,976
Indeed.

666
00:28:59,135 --> 00:28:59,695
Where?

667
00:28:59,695 --> 00:29:00,655
Everything's gone.

668
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:02,096
The provisions and funds...

669
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,056
Sun Xiangfu.

670
00:29:03,336 --> 00:29:04,135
At this point,

671
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,455
you still won't tell the truth?

672
00:29:15,496 --> 00:29:16,296
Father.

673
00:29:17,736 --> 00:29:18,336
Father.

674
00:29:34,695 --> 00:29:35,695
Commander Xiao.

675
00:29:38,088 --> 00:29:40,215
I know what you want.

676
00:29:41,415 --> 00:29:42,895
Spare my son and me,

677
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:45,256
and I'll tell you who...

678
00:29:46,855 --> 00:29:47,855
Assassins. Get them.

679
00:29:48,104 --> 00:29:48,935
Father!

680
00:29:49,224 --> 00:29:50,175
Father.

681
00:29:51,895 --> 00:29:52,576
Father!

682
00:29:53,695 --> 00:29:55,296
What should I do, Father?

683
00:29:57,536 --> 00:29:58,695
It's over.

684
00:29:58,895 --> 00:29:59,855
It's over.

685
00:30:00,536 --> 00:30:01,455
Father.

686
00:30:03,096 --> 00:30:04,016
Father.

687
00:30:05,615 --> 00:30:08,056
(What a great disciple of Xu Jingfu.)

688
00:30:15,695 --> 00:30:17,096
You've brought justice

689
00:30:17,695 --> 00:30:18,536
to those women.

690
00:30:19,296 --> 00:30:21,695
Had you not made plans to expose

691
00:30:22,215 --> 00:30:23,375
the Suns' crime

692
00:30:23,576 --> 00:30:24,776
against women,

693
00:30:25,736 --> 00:30:26,695
I wouldn't have been

694
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:28,776
of much help.

695
00:30:30,175 --> 00:30:30,895
Mr. Feinu.

696
00:30:31,575 --> 00:30:33,175
The Commander will invite the merchants.

697
00:30:33,736 --> 00:30:34,375
We noticed

698
00:30:34,695 --> 00:30:36,256
that some of the victims

699
00:30:36,615 --> 00:30:38,175
had luxurious attire.

700
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,415
They must be from wealthy families.

701
00:30:41,096 --> 00:30:42,096
Recently, we learned

702
00:30:42,296 --> 00:30:43,056
that in the city,

703
00:30:43,056 --> 00:30:44,895
some merchants lost their daughters.

704
00:30:45,016 --> 00:30:46,375
I bet there is a connection

705
00:30:47,336 --> 00:30:48,415
between these matters.

706
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:53,976
Those women would thank you.

707
00:30:57,135 --> 00:30:58,736
They would thank you, too.

708
00:31:02,455 --> 00:31:03,655
You did well

709
00:31:04,016 --> 00:31:05,175
by killing Sun Xiangfu.

710
00:31:05,776 --> 00:31:06,695
It's my job

711
00:31:06,855 --> 00:31:07,976
to share your burden.

712
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,415
(Account Book)
This is a double-edged sword.

713
00:31:10,976 --> 00:31:12,056
Either perish

714
00:31:12,256 --> 00:31:13,375
or prosper.

715
00:31:13,776 --> 00:31:14,375
It depends on

716
00:31:15,215 --> 00:31:15,855
how we wield it.

717
00:31:17,256 --> 00:31:17,816
Young Master.

718
00:31:18,215 --> 00:31:19,175
Xiao Jue's man saw me

719
00:31:19,175 --> 00:31:20,455
retrieving the ledger.

720
00:31:21,224 --> 00:31:22,296
I'm worried...

721
00:31:22,655 --> 00:31:23,816
Don't worry.

722
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:25,536
The Chancellor is my master.

723
00:31:25,816 --> 00:31:27,816
Xiao Jue is definitely suspecting me.

724
00:31:28,615 --> 00:31:29,256
But

725
00:31:29,415 --> 00:31:30,175
what can he do

726
00:31:30,576 --> 00:31:31,496
without evidence?

727
00:31:32,855 --> 00:31:33,375
Commander.

728
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,695
I followed a suspicious

729
00:31:34,695 --> 00:31:35,455
masked person

730
00:31:35,776 --> 00:31:36,415
all the way to

731
00:31:36,496 --> 00:31:37,296
Sun Ling's study.

732
00:31:38,215 --> 00:31:39,256
That person

733
00:31:39,296 --> 00:31:40,175
retrieved an item

734
00:31:40,496 --> 00:31:41,536
from a hidden compartment.

735
00:31:42,536 --> 00:31:44,016
I tried to recover it,

736
00:31:44,872 --> 00:31:46,016
but fell for a trick.

737
00:31:47,736 --> 00:31:48,736
Someone took advantage

738
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:51,256
of the chaos to reap the benefits.

739
00:31:52,135 --> 00:31:53,455
So well-planned.

740
00:31:54,415 --> 00:31:56,135
Sun Xiangfu guarded that item

741
00:31:56,336 --> 00:31:57,135
so well.

742
00:31:57,776 --> 00:31:59,615
It must be related to Xu Jingfu.

743
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:00,976
Who else

744
00:32:00,976 --> 00:32:01,895
besides me

745
00:32:02,455 --> 00:32:03,016
would care

746
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:04,496
so much about Xu Jingfu?

747
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:06,935
Chu Zhao?

748
00:32:08,576 --> 00:32:09,215
That's right.

749
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:13,736
But we lack evidence.

750
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,016
The military funds

751
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:19,135
and provisions

752
00:32:20,135 --> 00:32:21,375
have likely ended up

753
00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:22,695
in Xu Jingfu's pockets.

754
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:23,895
Commander.

755
00:32:24,336 --> 00:32:25,695
Are we really letting this go?

756
00:32:26,175 --> 00:32:27,056
What will the soldiers

757
00:32:27,096 --> 00:32:27,935
eat then?

758
00:32:30,855 --> 00:32:32,536
I'll settle this debt eventually.

759
00:32:34,776 --> 00:32:35,695
But for now,

760
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,736
we need another solution.

761
00:32:42,415 --> 00:32:43,215
Have the remains

762
00:32:44,215 --> 00:32:45,695
been claimed by families?

763
00:32:47,655 --> 00:32:48,816
Three are unclaimed.

764
00:32:49,096 --> 00:32:49,855
They came from

765
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:51,256
unknown origins.

766
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:52,256
No names.

767
00:32:52,855 --> 00:32:53,695
No records.

768
00:32:55,655 --> 00:32:57,536
Then let them rest in peace.

769
00:33:01,976 --> 00:33:04,175
(Outside Yezhou, there's a platform)

770
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,175
(named Chengfeng.)

771
00:33:08,215 --> 00:33:09,496
(Bury them there.)

772
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:12,655
(Roam freely with the wind)
(May they roam freely)

773
00:33:13,895 --> 00:33:15,056
(with the wind.)

774
00:33:16,415 --> 00:33:17,496
As the saying goes,

775
00:33:18,576 --> 00:33:20,375
women are praised for their gentleness.

776
00:33:21,615 --> 00:33:23,016
But gentleness implies weakness.

777
00:33:23,895 --> 00:33:24,776
We can't even

778
00:33:24,816 --> 00:33:26,016
protect ourselves out there.

779
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:29,736
This isn't about gender.

780
00:33:30,816 --> 00:33:31,695
Everyone

781
00:33:32,536 --> 00:33:34,056
grows from a fragile infant

782
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:34,855
to be an adult.

783
00:33:35,776 --> 00:33:36,816
If you hate being weak,

784
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:38,415
you can train

785
00:33:38,415 --> 00:33:39,296
like men do.

786
00:33:40,336 --> 00:33:41,096
Although

787
00:33:41,695 --> 00:33:42,695
it's harder

788
00:33:43,256 --> 00:33:44,536
for women,

789
00:33:45,455 --> 00:33:46,855
better to learn than not.

790
00:33:47,536 --> 00:33:48,096
You might

791
00:33:48,576 --> 00:33:49,736
even become a female general.

792
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:51,016
Men

793
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:52,695
should protect women

794
00:33:53,256 --> 00:33:54,695
and shelter them

795
00:33:55,135 --> 00:33:55,895
forever.

796
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,455
I don't believe

797
00:34:00,296 --> 00:34:02,135
women should entrust

798
00:34:02,615 --> 00:34:04,056
their lives to men.

799
00:34:04,816 --> 00:34:05,816
Instead of being

800
00:34:06,215 --> 00:34:07,056
a caged bird,

801
00:34:07,655 --> 00:34:09,016
it's better to grow wings.

802
00:34:10,456 --> 00:34:11,335
That's what

803
00:34:11,775 --> 00:34:13,215
the Commander engraved on the steel.

804
00:34:15,536 --> 00:34:16,576
Roam freely

805
00:34:17,295 --> 00:34:18,416
with the wind.

806
00:34:33,536 --> 00:34:35,096
Zilan, don't cry.

807
00:34:36,896 --> 00:34:38,976
(Chu Mingfang, Chu Zhao's mother)
I'm just tired.

808
00:34:39,735 --> 00:34:40,936
If we have a next life,

809
00:34:41,016 --> 00:34:42,655
I'd still choose to be a woman

810
00:34:42,695 --> 00:34:43,815
and your mother.

811
00:34:45,768 --> 00:34:48,135
I'll strengthen my wings

812
00:34:48,456 --> 00:34:50,096
to protect you better.

813
00:34:57,856 --> 00:34:59,416
(If only someone had offered)

814
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:00,896
(my mother justice)

815
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:03,896
(back then.)

816
00:35:06,056 --> 00:35:07,516
(Sun Mansion)

817
00:35:08,175 --> 00:35:09,335
Hurry. My lord.

818
00:35:09,416 --> 00:35:10,215
My lord.

819
00:35:10,856 --> 00:35:12,416
- My lord.
- My lord.

820
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:14,135
- Thank you, my lord.
- Thank you, my lord.

821
00:35:14,255 --> 00:35:15,056
Watch out.

822
00:35:15,255 --> 00:35:16,135
It's fine.

823
00:35:16,536 --> 00:35:18,695
They're here for you, Commander Xiao.

824
00:35:19,056 --> 00:35:19,655
Not really.

825
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:21,615
You contributed greatly, too.

826
00:35:22,056 --> 00:35:23,135
Thank you, my lords,

827
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:24,775
for punishing the corrupt officials.

828
00:35:25,016 --> 00:35:25,655
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

829
00:35:25,775 --> 00:35:26,295
Thank you.

830
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:27,416
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

831
00:35:27,576 --> 00:35:28,496
Take these.

832
00:35:28,695 --> 00:35:29,615
We appreciate it.

833
00:35:29,735 --> 00:35:30,335
Huaijin.

834
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:31,695
Are you overwhelmed

835
00:35:32,016 --> 00:35:33,295
by their enthusiasm?

836
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,056
Do you need my help?

837
00:35:35,576 --> 00:35:36,615
How will you help?

838
00:35:38,295 --> 00:35:39,335
I'll simply

839
00:35:40,335 --> 00:35:41,576
cover his eyes

840
00:35:41,815 --> 00:35:42,815
so that he can't see.

841
00:35:45,016 --> 00:35:46,295
The folks mean well.

842
00:35:46,792 --> 00:35:48,376
Commander Xiao shouldn't storm off,

843
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:49,896
right?

844
00:35:50,472 --> 00:35:51,056
Yeah.

845
00:35:51,056 --> 00:35:51,655
Yeah.

846
00:35:51,655 --> 00:35:52,456
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

847
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:53,695
- Take them.
- Take them.

848
00:35:53,856 --> 00:35:54,735
- Take them.
- Take them.

849
00:35:55,175 --> 00:35:56,215
Yeah, Huaijin.

850
00:35:56,536 --> 00:35:57,056
You see?

851
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:58,376
They're so enthusiastic.

852
00:35:58,775 --> 00:36:00,456
If you keep wearing that icy expression,

853
00:36:00,615 --> 00:36:01,815
it'll make you look heartless.

854
00:36:02,856 --> 00:36:03,416
Like this.

855
00:36:08,655 --> 00:36:09,576
What nonsense.

856
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:13,496
Commander Xiao.

857
00:36:13,815 --> 00:36:14,856
I will never forget

858
00:36:14,888 --> 00:36:16,175
your kindness.

859
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,056
Without you,

860
00:36:18,496 --> 00:36:19,695
my daughter would never...

861
00:36:21,896 --> 00:36:22,615
Never mind.

862
00:36:22,824 --> 00:36:23,655
Forget it.

863
00:36:24,376 --> 00:36:25,016
Commander Xiao.

864
00:36:25,335 --> 00:36:26,056
We know you came

865
00:36:26,056 --> 00:36:27,655
to secure provisions and funds

866
00:36:27,655 --> 00:36:28,976
for the Yezhou Garrison.

867
00:36:29,295 --> 00:36:30,295
So we collected

868
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:31,175
money and grains

869
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:33,335
from all the merchants

870
00:36:33,655 --> 00:36:35,856
as your provisions and funds.

871
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:37,695
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

872
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,376
Yeah, Commander.

873
00:36:38,376 --> 00:36:39,175
Please accept them.

874
00:36:39,255 --> 00:36:40,335
Take these.

875
00:36:40,456 --> 00:36:41,335
Take these.

876
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:44,215
I'm such a lucky charm.

877
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,016
A talent like me deserves

878
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:48,056
to join the Nine Banners Battalion.

879
00:36:50,376 --> 00:36:51,456
Allow me to thank you

880
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,135
on behalf of Yezhou Garrison.

881
00:36:55,056 --> 00:36:55,976
Our pleasure.

882
00:36:56,056 --> 00:36:56,655
- Our pleasure.
- Our pleasure.

883
00:36:56,695 --> 00:36:57,215
Take these.

884
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:57,936
Let's note down

885
00:36:57,936 --> 00:36:58,815
your contributions.

886
00:36:59,208 --> 00:36:59,896
Alright.

887
00:37:00,056 --> 00:37:01,096
- Alright.
- Alright!

888
00:37:01,215 --> 00:37:02,815
- Go.
- Let's go.

889
00:37:08,655 --> 00:37:09,335
Commander Xiao.

890
00:37:09,496 --> 00:37:10,096
Mr. Cheng.

891
00:37:10,536 --> 00:37:11,735
I'm returning soon.

892
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:13,896
I'll report this case

893
00:37:14,088 --> 00:37:15,295
to the court.

894
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,536
We'll meet again

895
00:37:16,896 --> 00:37:17,695
if fate permits.

896
00:37:20,296 --> 00:37:21,496
Mr. Chu, I wish you

897
00:37:21,856 --> 00:37:22,655
a smooth journey.

898
00:37:22,696 --> 00:37:23,536
Thank you.

899
00:37:24,215 --> 00:37:24,856
Mr. Cheng.

900
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,056
Actually,

901
00:37:26,295 --> 00:37:27,335
we've met several times.

902
00:37:27,615 --> 00:37:28,615
This is fate.

903
00:37:29,096 --> 00:37:29,815
But

904
00:37:30,335 --> 00:37:31,815
I still don't know your proper name.

905
00:37:32,456 --> 00:37:33,215
Unless you are

906
00:37:33,496 --> 00:37:34,936
truly Commander Xiao's nephew,

907
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:36,135
Cheng Lisu?

908
00:37:38,735 --> 00:37:39,496
I am He Yan.

909
00:37:40,096 --> 00:37:40,976
"He" for seedling,

910
00:37:41,576 --> 00:37:42,936
and "Yan" for peace.

911
00:37:43,752 --> 00:37:44,615
Thank you

912
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,615
for keeping my secret earlier, Mr. Chu.

913
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,976
My pleasure.

914
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:54,056
Mr. He, your sword dance

915
00:37:54,416 --> 00:37:55,335
was truly peerless.

916
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:57,456
You resemble

917
00:37:58,295 --> 00:37:59,456
a celestial from legends.

918
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,255
Rest assured.

919
00:38:05,815 --> 00:38:06,536
I will

920
00:38:07,096 --> 00:38:08,735
keep this a secret, too.

921
00:38:11,368 --> 00:38:12,615
Won't you pack?

922
00:38:13,295 --> 00:38:14,255
Aren't we going back?

923
00:38:14,815 --> 00:38:15,335
We are.

924
00:38:15,695 --> 00:38:16,536
Of course, we are.

925
00:38:39,752 --> 00:38:40,416
Huaijin.

926
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:41,175
Mr. He.

927
00:38:41,615 --> 00:38:42,815
You finally returned.

928
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:44,335
I never expected

929
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,496
that the Suns

930
00:38:45,544 --> 00:38:47,295
were beasts in human disguise.

931
00:38:47,496 --> 00:38:48,416
But it's not bad.

932
00:38:48,615 --> 00:38:50,056
With such unreliable matchmakers,

933
00:38:50,376 --> 00:38:51,016
my parents

934
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:52,215
won't force me to marry

935
00:38:52,295 --> 00:38:53,335
that venomous woman.

936
00:38:53,695 --> 00:38:54,896
Cheng Lisu!

937
00:38:56,976 --> 00:38:57,775
V-Venomous...

938
00:38:58,215 --> 00:38:59,016
Venomous woman!

939
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,016
What did you call me?

940
00:39:01,768 --> 00:39:02,416
Mr. He.

941
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:03,576
Catch up later.

942
00:39:03,976 --> 00:39:05,255
You can just tell me to leave.

943
00:39:05,335 --> 00:39:06,215
Why bring this

944
00:39:06,376 --> 00:39:07,016
venomous woman?

945
00:39:07,215 --> 00:39:07,896
Cheng Lisu.

946
00:39:07,896 --> 00:39:08,615
Prepare to die!

947
00:39:08,615 --> 00:39:09,416
N-No!

948
00:39:10,096 --> 00:39:10,735
Commander.

949
00:39:10,952 --> 00:39:12,335
What are they...?

950
00:39:12,775 --> 00:39:14,295
Cheng Lisu could be having a stroke.

951
00:39:14,824 --> 00:39:15,656
He needs treatment.

952
00:39:18,376 --> 00:39:19,735
Miss Song usually looks

953
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:20,655
gentle and quiet.

954
00:39:20,695 --> 00:39:21,856
But she's so fierce.

955
00:39:24,175 --> 00:39:25,615
Only you would think that.

956
00:39:26,936 --> 00:39:27,735
What do you mean?

957
00:39:28,456 --> 00:39:30,096
I thought you were a "talent".

958
00:39:30,896 --> 00:39:31,695
Use your brain.

959
00:39:35,176 --> 00:39:36,175
For what?

960
00:39:49,416 --> 00:39:50,175
Poison first.

961
00:39:50,615 --> 00:39:51,615
Then assassination.

962
00:39:53,096 --> 00:39:53,815
He Rufei

963
00:39:53,815 --> 00:39:55,096
hasn't changed a bit.

964
00:39:57,735 --> 00:39:59,695
But why did he attempt to

965
00:40:00,056 --> 00:40:01,016
kill Xiao Jue?

966
00:40:03,056 --> 00:40:04,536
Do they hold

967
00:40:05,896 --> 00:40:06,615
any grudges

968
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:08,056
that I am unaware of?
