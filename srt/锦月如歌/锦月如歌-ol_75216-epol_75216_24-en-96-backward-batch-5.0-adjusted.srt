=Episode 24=

23
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:43,890
I heard Wutuo has attacked Huayuan.

24
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:44,730
Really?

25
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,931
Wutuo just got defeat in Jiyang.

26
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:48,051
They attacked Huayuan?

27
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,491
It's true.

28
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:51,810
Someone just reported it to Mr. Shen,

29
00:01:51,971 --> 00:01:52,931
and I overheard it.

30
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:56,730
(Wutuo attacked Huayuan?)

31
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,971
(First Jiyang, now Huayuan.)

32
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,051
(Wutuo)

33
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,331
(seems to be probing)

34
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:02,691
(our military capabilities.)

35
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:04,530
(They might plan to start a war.)

36
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,810
General Feihong's leading

37
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:07,970
the troops to Huayuan.

38
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:09,891
He'll surely crush

39
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:11,011
those Wutuo soldiers!

40
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,570
Definitely.

41
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,611
(He Rufei is going to Huayuan?)

42
00:02:20,084 --> 00:02:22,912
(Yezhou Garrison)

43
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:25,931
What a spectacle!

44
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,370
Who are they receiving?

45
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:30,880
Fine.

46
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,370
You'll find out soon.

47
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,211
Been in the army so long,

48
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,171
surely you've heard of Yan He?

49
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,331
A classmate of Huaijin and me.

50
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:46,688
Look!

51
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:48,250
Now he acts all dignified.

52
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:58,570
(Exam Paper, C)

53
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,291
Why am I second from last again?

54
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,891
Why am I still last?

55
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:05,248
(Exam Paper, D)

56
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:07,650
Didn't we agree

57
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,771
you'd let me win once?

58
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:09,810
First,

59
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:11,291
I never agreed.

60
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,211
Second,

61
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:13,051
am I

62
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,530
much better than you?

63
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:15,968
Well...

64
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:17,810
- I...
- Look!

65
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:18,850
This...

66
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:29,810
Who are you?

67
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,456
- The Second.
- The one you beat.

68
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,611
I'm Yan He.

69
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:35,931
In the next exam,

70
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,491
I'll take first place!

71
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,370
How dare he say so?

72
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:41,731
Xiao Huaijin,

73
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:43,130
mark my words!

74
00:03:44,731 --> 00:03:45,690
Let's wait and see.

75
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,370
Oh my.

76
00:04:05,715 --> 00:04:07,051
(Yan He, Wei Dynasty General)

77
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:07,611
Hello.

78
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:08,771
Long time no see.

79
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:10,130
General Fengyun.

80
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:14,491
Long time no see.

81
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:20,851
It's been many years,

82
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,291
they are still at odds?

83
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:31,851
Chu Zhao?

84
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,010
Came to award someone?

85
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:40,171
Right.

86
00:04:40,651 --> 00:04:41,210
You have

87
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,171
defended Jiyang.

88
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:46,731
He Yan, heed the decree!

89
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,291
Yezhou Garrison He Yan,

90
00:04:59,611 --> 00:05:00,832
you have exceptional loyalty

91
00:05:00,931 --> 00:05:01,971
and combat prowess.

92
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:04,450
Your repeated victories against Wutuo

93
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,770
have pleased me.

94
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:07,570
Hereby you are promoted

95
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:08,890
to be General Wu'an.

96
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,171
General Wu'an.

97
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:18,810
I, He Yan,

98
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:19,931
appreciate it.

99
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,611
Xiao Jue, you've defended Jiyang,

100
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:34,010
but disobeyed orders

101
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,171
and got absent.

102
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:37,051
By the imperial decree,

103
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:38,651
you shall be caned

104
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,051
by 20 strikes.

105
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:43,690
(We share the same merits.)

106
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,770
(I got the reward,)

107
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,491
(yet Xiao Jue got punishment.)

108
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:47,690
(This is to)

109
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,851
(drive a wedge between us.)

110
00:05:49,531 --> 00:05:50,531
Commander won the battle!

111
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,531
Why punish him?

112
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:52,330
- Exactly!
- Exactly!

113
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:52,931
This is

114
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:53,851
unfair!

115
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,130
Punish the general,

116
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:55,648
what for?

117
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:56,330
Exactly!

118
00:05:56,531 --> 00:05:57,051
He defended

119
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:57,890
Jiyang too!

120
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,010
- Exactly!
- Exactly!

121
00:06:00,851 --> 00:06:01,491
Silence!

122
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,810
If order-breakers go unpunished,

123
00:06:07,051 --> 00:06:08,570
and others will follow suit,

124
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,016
where's the discipline?

125
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:20,731
I

126
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,611
accept it.

127
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,171
Good, Xiao Huaijin.

128
00:06:27,091 --> 00:06:28,370
You uphold your family's honor.

129
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,531
Then I'll carry out the punishment.

130
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,491
Chu Zhao from the Ministry of War

131
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:33,651
will oversee it.

132
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,531
Seriously?

133
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:36,531
20 strikes

134
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:37,370
could kill him!

135
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:38,250
Back off.

136
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,370
20 strikes!

137
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:47,250
Exactly.

138
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,010
Punishment...

139
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,130
Why?

140
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:38,651
Yan Nanguang

141
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,411
shows no mercy at all.

142
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,091
Might be doing it for a private grudge.

143
00:08:05,171 --> 00:08:05,731
Xiao Jue.

144
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,651
Your merits offset faults.

145
00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:08,690
Remember,

146
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:09,531
never again.

147
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:27,411
I

148
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,330
get it.

149
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:38,592
Huaijin.

150
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:44,810
Congratulations!

151
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,850
You petitioned for my promotion?

152
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,512
Right.

153
00:08:53,531 --> 00:08:54,450
You did very well.

154
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:55,411
This reward

155
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,610
is what you deserve.

156
00:08:58,051 --> 00:08:59,891
I left Yezhou Garrison
without permission too.

157
00:09:00,371 --> 00:09:01,651
Regarding the discipline,

158
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:02,970
I am also guilty.

159
00:09:06,131 --> 00:09:07,011
It was the Chancellor

160
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:08,730
who advised His Majesty

161
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:11,011
to offer fair rewards and punishments.

162
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:12,850
Commander Xiao

163
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:15,011
is a regional commander,

164
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,690
should lead by example

165
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,610
and set the standard,

166
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,291
so should take this minor punishment.

167
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,371
(As expected,)

168
00:09:25,251 --> 00:09:26,730
(Xu Jingfu is behind all this.)

169
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:32,931
In that case,

170
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,490
convey my thanks to Chancellor Xu.

171
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:25,664
Huaijin.

172
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:27,171
Let me tell you,

173
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:27,891
if I hurt you

174
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,570
carelessly,

175
00:10:30,011 --> 00:10:30,610
forgive me.

176
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,730
Why are you silent?

177
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,730
Are you displeased with me?

178
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:15,651
How about

179
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,251
I find someone else

180
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:18,090
to apply medicine?

181
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,210
Like

182
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,280
He Yan?

183
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:24,291
Shut up!

184
00:11:26,931 --> 00:11:28,090
You ungrateful guy!

185
00:11:33,771 --> 00:11:34,411
Wait a moment.

186
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:35,810
I'll go check

187
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:36,371
the decoction.

188
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,272
(Xiao)

189
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:31,171
Being publicly caned

190
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,210
must have humiliated you.

191
00:12:33,771 --> 00:12:34,931
Chancellor Xu

192
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:35,970
deliberately used

193
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,090
such a trick

194
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:37,690
to annoy you.

195
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:39,051
Don't blame it on

196
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:40,011
Miss He.

197
00:12:40,651 --> 00:12:41,850
She disguising as a man

198
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,850
remains a hidden danger.

199
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:45,810
If it gets exposed,

200
00:12:46,171 --> 00:12:47,131
she would be punished.

201
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,490
Now she gets promoted,

202
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,730
I wonder if it's blessing.

203
00:12:59,131 --> 00:13:00,051
You, Yan Nanguang!

204
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,131
Why come here?

205
00:13:01,371 --> 00:13:02,051
You hit him hard!

206
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:03,210
With so many eyes watching,

207
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:04,531
I can't show mercy publicly.

208
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,376
You!

209
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,291
Not my face!

210
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,330
Cold Xiao.

211
00:13:16,771 --> 00:13:17,330
Sorry.

212
00:13:20,371 --> 00:13:21,011
No need.

213
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,291
You were just doing your duty.

214
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:24,891
Don't be sorry.

215
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,144
Hey,

216
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,931
you came empty-handed?

217
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,891
I wanted to bring medicine,

218
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,011
but then realized

219
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,690
you are

220
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,251
here.

221
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,011
Why bother?

222
00:13:36,411 --> 00:13:37,131
You two,

223
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,210
at Xianchang Academy,

224
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,210
were really at odds,

225
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,210
yet now seem quite close.

226
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,450
That's all

227
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,850
in the past.

228
00:13:44,371 --> 00:13:45,610
Now we're all comrades.

229
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:46,592
Right?

230
00:13:47,131 --> 00:13:47,651
Moreover,

231
00:13:47,931 --> 00:13:49,251
I'm now a married man,

232
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,931
should be magnanimous.

233
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,371
Otherwise,

234
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,891
Chengxiu will nag me again.

235
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,810
We know your wife is expecting.

236
00:13:56,011 --> 00:13:57,051
No need to tell us again.

237
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:59,210
I want the whole world to know

238
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,291
Chengxiu and I are

239
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,171
having a child!

240
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,490
Then on the battlefields,

241
00:14:02,771 --> 00:14:03,970
stop acting recklessly.

242
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,371
Think about your family.

243
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,490
Of course.

244
00:14:07,171 --> 00:14:07,771
Anyway,

245
00:14:07,771 --> 00:14:08,891
His Majesty didn't pick me

246
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:10,090
to Huayuan,

247
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,051
but that He Rufei.

248
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:12,810
What?

249
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,891
Why He Rufei?

250
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,570
I'm tired.

251
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:24,651
You guys go out.

252
00:14:24,891 --> 00:14:25,931
Take your medicine.

253
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,610
Let me tell you,

254
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:30,171
you were too harsh.

255
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,490
20 strikes!

256
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:32,970
Just plead for him.

257
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,090
Too many people there.

258
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,051
Has Feinu's message

259
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:45,024
arrived?

260
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:46,570
Commander.

261
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:48,291
After the Mingshui Battle,

262
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:48,891
Chu Zhao once

263
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,011
visited Que City.

264
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,651
Our agents discovered

265
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:53,570
he made contact with Chai Anxi.

266
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,411
How about before that?

267
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:56,690
Before that,

268
00:14:57,011 --> 00:14:57,651
we detected

269
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,291
nothing on Chu Zhao.

270
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,531
The Mingshui Battle

271
00:15:00,931 --> 00:15:02,171
might have nothing to him.

272
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,690
And He Rufei?

273
00:15:06,371 --> 00:15:07,171
He Rufei

274
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,090
and Xu Jingfu

275
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:09,051
had no interactions

276
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:10,371
before Mingshui Battle.

277
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,531
But after the Mingshui Battle started,

278
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:13,490
the two of them

279
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,610
grew close.

280
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:16,011
But before the Battle,

281
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:17,690
Chancellor Xu once

282
00:15:18,011 --> 00:15:19,610
visited Yuhua Temple

283
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,490
to meet the lady from He family,

284
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:22,810
He Rufei's sister.

285
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,490
I wonder

286
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,210
what he is up to.

287
00:15:31,891 --> 00:15:33,651
Now He Rufei's deployed to Huayuan,

288
00:15:34,931 --> 00:15:36,371
Mingshui Battle's tragedy

289
00:15:36,371 --> 00:15:37,090
might repeat.

290
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,771
Send a message to Feinu.

291
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,251
Tell him to

292
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,730
keep watching He Rufei.

293
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,032
Understood.

294
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:01,690
Why are you here?

295
00:16:02,531 --> 00:16:03,610
I parted from you

296
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:04,771
without thanking you.

297
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,291
I asked around

298
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,450
and knew you're here.

299
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:08,730
For what?

300
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,570
For you saved me in Jiyang!

301
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:12,651
I still remember it.

302
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:14,570
It was nothing.

303
00:16:15,011 --> 00:16:15,531
Not at all.

304
00:16:20,531 --> 00:16:22,011
At present, in the imperial court,

305
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,171
many fear and resent Xiao Jue.

306
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:25,570
His future is unclear.

307
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,291
If anything occurs,

308
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,690
you might be implicated.

309
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,210
Though General Wu'an's post
holds low rank,

310
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:32,810
it allows you

311
00:16:33,251 --> 00:16:34,570
to go wherever you want

312
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:36,131
and have broader options.

313
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,651
Isn't it good?

314
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,330
Promotion is undoubtedly favorable.

315
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,051
I should be pleased.

316
00:16:47,651 --> 00:16:48,171
Mr. He,

317
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,330
have you ever considered

318
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,011
that to achieve greatness,

319
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,450
you needn't

320
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,931
limit yourself to Yezhou?

321
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,770
Would you like to see the world

322
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:05,571
and venture into it

323
00:17:06,371 --> 00:17:07,050
with me?

324
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,131
I appreciate it, Mr. Chu.

325
00:17:25,171 --> 00:17:26,131
Perhaps one day,

326
00:17:26,891 --> 00:17:28,131
I'll leave the Yezhou Garrison.

327
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:29,970
That's because

328
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:31,250
I need to do

329
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,530
what I must do,

330
00:17:33,371 --> 00:17:34,770
but not Yezhou's harsh conditions.

331
00:17:37,411 --> 00:17:38,210
Is that all?

332
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:40,210
Not because of

333
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:41,891
someone?

334
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,770
In this world,

335
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,651
everything can change.

336
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,450
No one

337
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:53,891
can stay by anyone's side forever.

338
00:17:55,811 --> 00:17:58,010
I'm simply doing

339
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:00,450
what I want.

340
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,040
Mr. Chu.

341
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,160
It's getting late.

342
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:09,536
See you.

343
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,032
Commander.

344
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:32,928
What is it?

345
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,112
General Feihong

346
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:35,450
won the Huayuan Battle.

347
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,530
He Rufei has

348
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,450
so many soldiers.

349
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,210
Even a child could've

350
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,010
won.

351
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,171
Any other updates?

352
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,010
The battle was won,

353
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:47,490
but seven deputy generals

354
00:18:47,651 --> 00:18:49,210
under General Feihong died.

355
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:50,931
So,

356
00:18:51,651 --> 00:18:52,931
he won the Huayuan Battle

357
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,450
in a tragic way?

358
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:55,970
Many people died,

359
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,411
even including

360
00:18:58,891 --> 00:18:59,970
seven deputy generals?

361
00:19:01,371 --> 00:19:02,651
Doesn't this feel familiar?

362
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,171
The Huayuan Battle

363
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:06,530
mirrors

364
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,010
the Mingshui Battle's trajectory.

365
00:19:08,611 --> 00:19:09,931
Though appearing flawless,

366
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,851
it's full of suspicions.

367
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:13,376
Exactly.

368
00:19:14,091 --> 00:19:15,091
I've never met them,

369
00:19:15,411 --> 00:19:17,010
but Fuyue Army's seven deputy generals

370
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:17,811
were legendary.

371
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,450
Each was capable,

372
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,290
yet all died on the battlefield?

373
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,010
There's no such thing

374
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:23,931
as coincidence here.

375
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:25,851
Did He Rufei

376
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,250
murder them

377
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:28,730
on purpose?

378
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,331
In that case,

379
00:19:30,891 --> 00:19:32,131
what for?

380
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,091
He must

381
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:36,171
do it for

382
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,611
hiding something.

383
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,010
(So,)

384
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,891
(this He Rufei is)

385
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,331
(the schemer)

386
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:45,770
(from the Mingshui Battle.)

387
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,200
Where's He Yan?

388
00:20:13,684 --> 00:20:15,488
(Maningbu, Wutuo Chancellor)

389
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,891
You're late.

390
00:20:19,931 --> 00:20:21,371
Three penalty drinks.

391
00:20:22,091 --> 00:20:23,530
I need to act in discretion,

392
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,970
hence being cautious

393
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:26,931
delays me.

394
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,450
I beg your forgiveness.

395
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:29,250
Don't be.

396
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:29,984
Take a seat.

397
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:33,888
Here.

398
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,371
I heard, at the Huayuan Battle,

399
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,770
your emperor

400
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,651
sent you to lead the troops.

401
00:20:42,891 --> 00:20:43,891
You are quite

402
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:45,290
well-informed.

403
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,611
You asked me to come

404
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:49,091
not merely for drinks,

405
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:50,250
right?

406
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,010
Since we

407
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,250
are old acquaintances,

408
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:55,690
so I'll be direct.

409
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,411
I must win

410
00:20:58,371 --> 00:20:59,290
the Huayuan Battle.

411
00:21:02,091 --> 00:21:03,931
We got defeated in Jiyang,

412
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:05,730
and need this victory

413
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:06,730
to restore morale.

414
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,611
I'd ask you to let us

415
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:09,371
win once.

416
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:10,811
Losing Huayuan

417
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,490
would leave me

418
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,131
unable to face our king.

419
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,250
How about

420
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:18,411
compensate by exchanging Rundu

421
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:19,651
for Huayuan?

422
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:21,931
Rundu?

423
00:21:22,611 --> 00:21:24,091
Rundu is the gateway

424
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:25,010
to Yaojing,

425
00:21:25,891 --> 00:21:27,171
more crucial than Huayuan.

426
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,331
Do you mean it?

427
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:36,851
This is...

428
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:39,091
(Rundu Military Defense Map)

429
00:21:40,611 --> 00:21:41,891
Rundu Military Defense Map?

430
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,091
General Li Kuang defending Rundu

431
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,450
is one of the Eight Warriors
from the Fuyue Army.

432
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,290
Once Wutuo attacks Rundu

433
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,530
and he's overwhelmed,

434
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:51,250
he'll request aid from the Fuyue Army.

435
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:52,450
And I

436
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,450
will never aid him.

437
00:21:55,371 --> 00:21:56,530
To show my sincerity,

438
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:57,931
once war breaks out in Huayuan,

439
00:21:58,131 --> 00:21:59,371
I'm willing to sacrifice

440
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,490
the lives
of other seven deputy generals.

441
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:04,891
The Eight Warriors

442
00:22:05,651 --> 00:22:06,811
and Rundu city,

443
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,050
in exchange for Huayuan.

444
00:22:10,851 --> 00:22:12,811
What a bargain!

445
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,131
Since you show such sincerity,

446
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:18,891
I shall

447
00:22:19,091 --> 00:22:20,530
do you a favor.

448
00:22:20,571 --> 00:22:21,091
Good.

449
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,811
Surprise,

450
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,050
He Yan?

451
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,050
All seven of your warriors

452
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,690
have died in Huayuan.

453
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:30,720
Rest assured.

454
00:22:31,571 --> 00:22:33,010
The remaining Li Kuang

455
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:34,891
won't escape either.

456
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:38,091
Once he's gone,

457
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:40,651
you will never

458
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:44,571
see hope again.

459
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,730
Did you sneak food

460
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:49,010
last night?

461
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,091
That must be Wang Ba!

462
00:22:51,331 --> 00:22:52,371
Why would I do so?

463
00:22:52,891 --> 00:22:53,411
Anyway,

464
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,411
that General Feihong

465
00:22:54,411 --> 00:22:55,371
is utterly useless.

466
00:22:57,571 --> 00:22:58,450
- He.
- He.

467
00:22:58,851 --> 00:22:59,611
Congratulations!

468
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:01,611
He

469
00:23:01,611 --> 00:23:02,571
won't stop here.

470
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,131
You are brave and astute,

471
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,530
must achieve something big.

472
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:07,488
Jiang Jiao.

473
00:23:07,851 --> 00:23:08,611
What did you say

474
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,730
about General Feihong?

475
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,331
General Feihong?

476
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,171
All seven men he led

477
00:23:14,331 --> 00:23:15,371
died on the battlefield.

478
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:18,131
He's not a General at all!

479
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,611
Seven Warriors

480
00:23:23,131 --> 00:23:24,490
died on the battlefield?

481
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:12,171
(As)

482
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:13,210
(General Feihong's plan),

483
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,730
we'd push them back

484
00:24:14,891 --> 00:24:15,730
through the valley

485
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,371
and watch them flee.

486
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,210
How pleasant!

487
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,530
Right!

488
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,490
(All soldiers!)

489
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,131
Yes!

490
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,250
Today's battle

491
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:34,730
is fought for Wei,

492
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:36,970
and peace across the land!

493
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,651
Be fearless of death!

494
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,210
Return only victorious!

495
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:41,851
Never

496
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,131
dishonor our Fuyue Army's name!

497
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,050
Be fearless of death!

498
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:47,730
Return only victorious!

499
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,290
(Be fearless of death!)

500
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,091
(Return only victorious!)

501
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,891
(Be fearless of death!)

502
00:24:53,331 --> 00:24:54,730
(Return only victorious!)

503
00:26:25,811 --> 00:26:26,411
Seven Warriors

504
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,210
were important to you.

505
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,690
Now that they died,

506
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:32,770
you must be in pain.

507
00:26:33,931 --> 00:26:35,450
However, you shall not be punished,

508
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,131
but He Rufei.

509
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:41,010
He Rufei!

510
00:26:43,651 --> 00:26:45,010
I will

511
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,690
revenge you!

512
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:08,960
Let me.

513
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,331
My seven men died.

514
00:28:04,411 --> 00:28:06,171
I can't kill the murderer for them,

515
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,371
nor pay tribute to them.

516
00:28:14,811 --> 00:28:16,490
And I can't even shed tears.

517
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,131
If not for me,

518
00:28:20,091 --> 00:28:21,970
they wouldn't have died!

519
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,450
This pain

520
00:28:29,411 --> 00:28:31,171
constantly reminds me

521
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,171
I must

522
00:28:36,171 --> 00:28:37,690
make this vengeance.

523
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,450
Both my parents passed away,

524
00:28:50,411 --> 00:28:52,010
I had no time to mourn properly.

525
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,450
Everyone accused me

526
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,450
of being heartless and cold.

527
00:28:58,891 --> 00:29:00,571
But every time I don this armor,

528
00:29:01,811 --> 00:29:02,891
every time I carry

529
00:29:03,811 --> 00:29:05,010
the pouch made by my mother,

530
00:29:05,891 --> 00:29:06,690
I realize

531
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,690
they've always been

532
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,730
in my heart.

533
00:29:20,411 --> 00:29:21,091
You and I

534
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,411
always share similar experiences.

535
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:27,171
Be it our pasts

536
00:29:28,611 --> 00:29:29,571
or present,

537
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:33,530
your pains

538
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,411
resonate within me.

539
00:29:42,611 --> 00:29:43,490
It was you...

540
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,690
Because of you,

541
00:29:51,571 --> 00:29:52,730
I choose to believe.

542
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:55,891
General Fengyun Xiao Jue,

543
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,851
immediately go to Peidu
to meet His Majesty.

544
00:30:10,803 --> 00:30:13,952
(Xiao)

545
00:30:17,411 --> 00:30:18,730
Commander, take care.

546
00:30:21,171 --> 00:30:22,210
Won't you come with me?

547
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,490
I won't go.

548
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:28,411
Wait for me at Yezhou Garrison.

549
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:29,970
When I return,

550
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:32,131
I have things to tell you.

551
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:23,970
This is soaked

552
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,290
with Commander Xiao's blood.

553
00:31:25,811 --> 00:31:27,131
I've been scrubbing it for long.

554
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,250
That General Yan He

555
00:31:29,331 --> 00:31:30,450
is truly ruthless.

556
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,490
Though he's dashing,

557
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,530
quite accomplished for his age.

558
00:31:38,411 --> 00:31:39,931
He's dashing, but he's been married.

559
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,371
Stop dreaming.

560
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:43,931
I'm not dreaming.

561
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,171
My ambitions remain unfulfilled.

562
00:31:46,931 --> 00:31:48,411
I have no time for that.

563
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,450
I'm not as ambitious as you.

564
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,131
I'm thinking of a lady.

565
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:11,931
Who is she?

566
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,010
She's determined

567
00:32:14,651 --> 00:32:15,450
with a temper.

568
00:32:17,411 --> 00:32:18,411
What?

569
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,210
Yet she's wise,

570
00:32:20,651 --> 00:32:21,371
possessing

571
00:32:21,651 --> 00:32:23,290
a compassionate heart.

572
00:32:25,371 --> 00:32:26,690
That's all?

573
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,331
She's never hypocritical,

574
00:32:31,131 --> 00:32:32,210
always genuine with others.

575
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,690
This is why she captivates me.

576
00:32:47,136 --> 00:32:51,187
(Wei's Palace, Cheng'an Hall)

577
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,050
Xiao,

578
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,730
you are being hesitant,

579
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,210
not quite

580
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,131
your style.

581
00:33:37,091 --> 00:33:38,290
You are a strategy master,

582
00:33:38,651 --> 00:33:39,424
so I have to

583
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,131
be cautious

584
00:33:41,851 --> 00:33:42,690
in my actions.

585
00:33:43,851 --> 00:33:44,651
You are

586
00:33:44,651 --> 00:33:46,010
really flattering me.

587
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:47,611
If I am

588
00:33:48,411 --> 00:33:50,210
really a strategy master,

589
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:51,571
the borders

590
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,851
wouldn't be in such turmoil

591
00:33:54,611 --> 00:33:56,530
and our people tormented.

592
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,291
I'm sorry.

593
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,130
I deserve punishment.

594
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:08,610
I'm merely reflecting,

595
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:09,331
not blaming you.

596
00:34:10,211 --> 00:34:10,848
Sit down.

597
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,130
Our game is still going.

598
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,650
After taking 20 strikes,

599
00:34:26,811 --> 00:34:27,650
you must be injured.

600
00:34:30,931 --> 00:34:31,731
I'm

601
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:32,610
mostly healed.

602
00:34:33,411 --> 00:34:34,490
Thank you for your concern.

603
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:37,090
Being caned

604
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,931
20 strikes publicly,

605
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,650
do you think

606
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,891
I'm unfair?

607
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:47,010
I wouldn't dare.

608
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:49,291
I deserved punishment

609
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,130
for being absent in my post.

610
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:55,891
On the one hand,

611
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,610
as a commander,

612
00:34:58,211 --> 00:34:59,691
you violated military discipline,

613
00:34:59,891 --> 00:35:00,731
shall be punished

614
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:01,888
to restore discipline.

615
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,211
On the other hand,

616
00:35:03,891 --> 00:35:05,811
you risked your life
to achieve great feats,

617
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:07,731
yet I had to punish you.

618
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:08,970
Thus,

619
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,970
I owe it to you,

620
00:35:11,891 --> 00:35:13,891
and seek to compensate you.

621
00:35:29,851 --> 00:35:30,650
Don't be.

622
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,570
I don't deserve it.

623
00:35:36,211 --> 00:35:36,736
However,

624
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:39,291
I do have something to report.

625
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:47,022
(Lanhui Pavilion)

626
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,192
Mister.

627
00:36:05,411 --> 00:36:05,931
Is

628
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:07,251
His Majesty asleep?

629
00:36:07,691 --> 00:36:08,331
Not yet.

630
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,211
His Majesty and General Xiao

631
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,371
are in a chess game.

632
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,371
Then please inform His Majesty

633
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,731
that I am here

634
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,291
to beg for punishment.

635
00:36:17,771 --> 00:36:19,170
His Majesty said,

636
00:36:19,691 --> 00:36:20,970
before the game concludes,

637
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:22,771
no disturbances shall be permitted.

638
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,851
Then I shall wait here.

639
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,490
I see.

640
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,251
This outcome truly surprised me.

641
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,570
This isn't merely complicated,

642
00:36:46,411 --> 00:36:48,130
could even be called

643
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,170
extraordinary.

644
00:36:50,691 --> 00:36:51,456
Your Majesty.

645
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:54,650
Rest assured.

646
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:56,291
I keep my word.

647
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,970
Having granted your request,

648
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:01,211
I shall not regret.

649
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:09,811
I

650
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,170
appreciate it.

651
00:37:15,892 --> 00:37:19,571
(Lanhui Pavilion)

652
00:37:36,979 --> 00:37:39,360
(Lanhui Pavilion)

653
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:47,291
General He.

654
00:37:48,291 --> 00:37:49,170
Long time no see.

655
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:53,530
Indeed.

656
00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:54,851
General Xiao,

657
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,731
I heard you were punished.

658
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:58,811
How are you

659
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:00,130
now?

660
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,170
Better than you.

661
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:04,320
After all,

662
00:38:04,851 --> 00:38:06,450
you rushed here to claim merits,

663
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,811
yet spent the night chilled outside.

664
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:10,970
You might catch cold.

665
00:38:12,731 --> 00:38:13,530
General Xiao,

666
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,411
this joke

667
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:17,251
isn't amusing.

668
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,251
Indeed, compared to

669
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:22,731
your performance at Huayuan Battle.

670
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:24,411
Xiao Jue.

671
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,251
Don't try to

672
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,010
slander me here.

673
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:30,931
I've heard,

674
00:38:31,411 --> 00:38:32,331
in the Huayuan Battle,

675
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,450
you're late for reinforcements

676
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:36,490
somehow.

677
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,490
This reminds me of

678
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:41,291
your late arrival

679
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:45,411
at the Mingshui Battle as well.

680
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,090
I wonder if you deserve your title,

681
00:38:48,691 --> 00:38:50,411
General Feihong?

682
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:53,650
Or perhaps

683
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:56,291
there's some secret?

684
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:01,570
Xiao Jue!

685
00:39:02,411 --> 00:39:04,291
Heed the imperial decree!

686
00:39:09,291 --> 00:39:11,490
For crushing the Wutuo Army at Huayuan

687
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,090
and returning victorious,

688
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,691
General Feihong,

689
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:15,851
you've performed well,

690
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,291
and pleased me.

691
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,811
Considering your arduous journey

692
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:21,090
and the strain of travel,

693
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,130
so court formalities are waived.

694
00:39:23,251 --> 00:39:24,891
Return promptly to camp

695
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,450
and prepare the troops.

696
00:39:29,771 --> 00:39:30,970
I want to see His Majesty!

697
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,650
His Majesty is asleep.

698
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:36,731
I

699
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:38,291
accept it.

700
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,771
His Majesty truly concerns you.

701
00:39:48,771 --> 00:39:49,851
Please don't

702
00:39:50,211 --> 00:39:51,450
let His Majesty down

703
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:54,970
and return to your camp

704
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,530
soon.

705
00:40:08,883 --> 00:40:11,291
(Yezhou Huayuan)

706
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:13,211
Li Kuang is my remaining subordinate.

707
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:15,211
He Rufei will certainly eliminate him.

708
00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:16,970
If Rundu faces danger,

709
00:40:17,371 --> 00:40:19,090
He Rufei won't send reinforcement.

710
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:21,010
By that time,

711
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:22,050
it'll be too late.

712
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,371
(Rundu)
Rundu is defended by Li Kuang

713
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:27,650
and is a military stronghold.

714
00:40:29,251 --> 00:40:30,211
I must go there.

715
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,931
(I won't let Li Kuang die.)

716
00:41:06,851 --> 00:41:08,450
(Nor will I let Rundu fall.)

717
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:22,944

to aid the Rundu crisis.)
