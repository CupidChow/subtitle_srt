Poison first, and then assassinate.

24
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:58,192
He Rufei

25
00:01:58,192 --> 00:01:59,431
hasn't changed a bit.

26
00:02:01,112 --> 00:02:03,192
But his attempt to kill Xiao Jue

27
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:05,256
is because of the Mingshui Battle.

28
00:02:08,272 --> 00:02:09,551
He Rufei is getting desperate.

29
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:12,111
Truly like a cornered beast lashing out.

30
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:25,032
We should question

31
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:27,951
General Feihong, who supported Mingshui.

32
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:30,752
As a firsthand witness,

33
00:02:30,872 --> 00:02:34,111
he should know the truth.

34
00:02:37,152 --> 00:02:38,111
General Fengyun,

35
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:40,951
I immediately dispatched troops

36
00:02:41,231 --> 00:02:42,831
upon receiving the distress call,

37
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,671
without any delay.

38
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,992
He Rufei,

39
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,791
it was you

40
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:50,152
who delayed reinforcement

41
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:53,231
and caused my father

42
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:56,671
and the Xiao Army troops

43
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:57,951
to perish tragically!

44
00:02:58,351 --> 00:02:58,872
(No.)

45
00:02:59,272 --> 00:03:00,391
(Upon receiving the letter,)

46
00:03:00,712 --> 00:03:01,752
(I dispatched troops.)

47
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,312
(Why did Xiao Jue say)

48
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:04,511
(I delayed the rescue?)

49
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:07,816
Xiao Jue would never lie.

50
00:03:08,551 --> 00:03:10,032
There must be something wrong.

51
00:03:12,312 --> 00:03:13,631
Even the whole Mingshui Battle

52
00:03:14,872 --> 00:03:16,071
might be a conspiracy,

53
00:03:16,992 --> 00:03:18,351
to eliminate

54
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,111
General Xiao

55
00:03:20,872 --> 00:03:22,152
and the Xiao Army.

56
00:03:24,272 --> 00:03:25,351
(I heard General Xiao)

57
00:03:25,671 --> 00:03:27,671
(often opposed Chancellor Xu in court.)

58
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:30,231
(Though Chancellor Xu appears virtuous,)

59
00:03:30,872 --> 00:03:31,951
(everyone knows)

60
00:03:32,272 --> 00:03:33,272
(he's vindictive.)

61
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:35,592
(This must be his doing.)

62
00:03:37,192 --> 00:03:38,071
(As for He Rufei,)

63
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,631
(he sent Ding Yi to kill Xiao Jue.)

64
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:42,912
(Did he get involved too)

65
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:44,391
(and fear exposure?)

66
00:03:47,472 --> 00:03:48,511
(It doesn't make sense.)

67
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,351
(Before Mingshui Battle,)

68
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,312
(He Rufei was still at Yuhua Temple.)

69
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:54,472
(He couldn't have interfered)

70
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:55,511
(with military matters.)

71
00:04:03,472 --> 00:04:04,752
He Rufei likely feared

72
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:05,752
his identity

73
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:08,472
being exposed by Xiao Jue,
his former classmate.

74
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:10,032
Even so,

75
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:11,511
I mustn't allow him

76
00:04:11,912 --> 00:04:13,351
to keep exploiting this identity

77
00:04:13,951 --> 00:04:15,511
for mischief.

78
00:04:29,671 --> 00:04:30,191
Wang Ba,

79
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:31,712
next time you ambush someone,

80
00:04:31,952 --> 00:04:33,224
lighten your footsteps.

81
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:33,832
It...

82
00:04:33,832 --> 00:04:35,431
It wasn't an ambush!

83
00:04:35,712 --> 00:04:36,751
I just wanted to check

84
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,152
if your skills have got rusty.

85
00:04:39,152 --> 00:04:39,784
Wang,

86
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:40,791
you seem

87
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:41,800
thoughtless.

88
00:04:42,472 --> 00:04:43,671
Mr. Shen warned us

89
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:44,584
that He

90
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:45,351
was injured.

91
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,111
Why test him now?

92
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:46,952
You're thoughtless.

93
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:47,952
By the way, He Yan,

94
00:04:47,952 --> 00:04:48,791
how's your injury?

95
00:04:49,311 --> 00:04:50,431
Minor wound. It's healing.

96
00:04:50,512 --> 00:04:51,392
It has scabbed over.

97
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:52,311
In that case,

98
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:53,912
we're taking you somewhere

99
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:55,392
as a welcome celebration.

100
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,360
Right.

101
00:04:56,592 --> 00:04:57,096
I'll lead.

102
00:04:58,551 --> 00:04:59,176
Let's go.

103
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:36,231
Commander, since He Yan has nothing
to do with He Rufei,

104
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:38,311
why keep Mr. Shen

105
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:39,032
monitoring him?

106
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:41,272
Even if he's not He Rufei's man,

107
00:05:41,912 --> 00:05:42,696
he still has

108
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,472
questionable aspects.

109
00:05:45,072 --> 00:05:46,351
We must stay vigilant.

110
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:48,592
With enemies at our door,

111
00:05:49,712 --> 00:05:50,920
the Xiao Army

112
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:52,912
can't endure

113
00:05:52,912 --> 00:05:53,952
another storm.

114
00:05:58,072 --> 00:05:58,871
Where's He Yan

115
00:05:59,551 --> 00:06:00,231
right now?

116
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:02,671
She was dragged by his peers
to a hot spring.

117
00:06:09,991 --> 00:06:11,152
Mai, I can't do it!

118
00:06:11,592 --> 00:06:12,152
Listen to me.

119
00:06:12,152 --> 00:06:12,871
Listen to me!

120
00:06:13,512 --> 00:06:14,751
My wound hasn't healed yet.

121
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:15,632
I can't do this.

122
00:06:20,072 --> 00:06:20,871
He,

123
00:06:21,191 --> 00:06:22,272
don't worry.

124
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,144
Look.

125
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:24,431
The hot spring water

126
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,272
is very shallow.

127
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:25,991
Only waist-deep.

128
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:26,991
Rest assured.

129
00:06:27,431 --> 00:06:28,632
Your wound

130
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:29,311
will be fine.

131
00:06:29,351 --> 00:06:30,152
Don't worry, okay?

132
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:31,272
- Right.
- Exactly.

133
00:06:31,272 --> 00:06:33,072
We're all men.

134
00:06:33,272 --> 00:06:34,751
Come down. It'll be fine.

135
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,231
- Exactly.
- Yeah, come on down.

136
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:37,231
- He Yan.
- Join us.

137
00:06:37,952 --> 00:06:38,472
He Yan,

138
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:39,431
soaking in hot springs

139
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:40,111
is good for you.

140
00:06:40,152 --> 00:06:41,272
A short soak won't hurt.

141
00:06:41,351 --> 00:06:42,440
You're not a lady.

142
00:06:42,712 --> 00:06:43,512
Come down quickly.

143
00:06:44,744 --> 00:06:45,431
- Hurry.
- Hurry.

144
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:46,712
Hurry down and play with us.

145
00:06:47,111 --> 00:06:47,791
Come down.

146
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:48,991
- Come soak a bit.
- Come on.

147
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:50,392
No, I can't.

148
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:51,152
It feels good.

149
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:52,231
Just come down.

150
00:06:53,152 --> 00:06:54,111
Don't run. Join us.

151
00:06:54,431 --> 00:06:55,111
Come on.

152
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:58,111
Stop running.

153
00:06:58,431 --> 00:06:59,351
I really can't do this.

154
00:06:59,512 --> 00:07:00,351
- I can't...
- Hurry.

155
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,072
I can't. I...

156
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,768
Pull him down.

157
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:02,280
I can't.

158
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:04,431
Come on.

159
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:05,912
I...

160
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:06,912
I really can't. I...

161
00:07:07,032 --> 00:07:07,712
Come on.

162
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:14,392
Commander.

163
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,512
- Commander.
- Commander.

164
00:07:17,472 --> 00:07:18,152
Commander,

165
00:07:18,152 --> 00:07:19,791
you arrived just in time.

166
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:20,392
Get up.

167
00:07:24,136 --> 00:07:24,712
Commander.

168
00:07:26,952 --> 00:07:28,311
Don't take him to hot springs.

169
00:07:29,392 --> 00:07:29,912
Commander.

170
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:32,671
Why...

171
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:35,952
Why can't we bring him along?

172
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:37,111
Yeah, why?

173
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:38,272
Why?

174
00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:41,832
He's physically weak.

175
00:07:43,512 --> 00:07:44,272
Physically weak?

176
00:07:44,712 --> 00:07:46,431
He seems perfectly healthy to me.

177
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,832
Physically weak?

178
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,072
Well... Um...

179
00:07:51,072 --> 00:07:51,791
I...

180
00:07:52,392 --> 00:07:53,072
Won't you go?

181
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:55,111
Or

182
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:56,472
do you want to go down?

183
00:08:00,776 --> 00:08:01,352
Commander,

184
00:08:01,512 --> 00:08:02,632
are you telling the truth?

185
00:08:02,664 --> 00:08:03,208
He...

186
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,231
How could he be physically weak?

187
00:08:05,608 --> 00:08:06,152
Exactly.

188
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,191
Being weak troubles him.

189
00:08:07,351 --> 00:08:08,712
I wonder in what way he's weak.

190
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:10,512
Well... What...

191
00:08:10,512 --> 00:08:11,191
What does

192
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,632
"physically weak" really mean?

193
00:08:12,912 --> 00:08:13,991
Yezhou Garrison's top one,

194
00:08:13,991 --> 00:08:14,671
He Yan,

195
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:15,712
is physically weak?

196
00:08:15,991 --> 00:08:16,912
Is that true?

197
00:08:19,816 --> 00:08:20,392
Do you know?

198
00:08:20,832 --> 00:08:22,072
He Yan is physically weak.

199
00:08:23,152 --> 00:08:23,791
The top one

200
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:24,632
in Yezhou Garrison?

201
00:08:24,632 --> 00:08:25,152
Right.

202
00:08:25,152 --> 00:08:25,791
No way.

203
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:26,431
Seriously?

204
00:08:27,311 --> 00:08:28,072
Who'd believe that?

205
00:09:02,471 --> 00:09:03,071
(He,)

206
00:09:03,591 --> 00:09:04,232
(we pooled)

207
00:09:04,392 --> 00:09:05,032
(our money)

208
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:05,912
(to buy these dishes)

209
00:09:06,152 --> 00:09:06,831
(to nourish you.)

210
00:09:07,232 --> 00:09:07,831
(Don't worry.)

211
00:09:08,152 --> 00:09:08,951
(Every problem)

212
00:09:09,191 --> 00:09:10,071
(has its solution.)

213
00:09:10,431 --> 00:09:11,431
(We'll help you).

214
00:09:28,752 --> 00:09:30,311
He, are you in there?

215
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,083
Yes.

216
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:33,671
Miss Song,

217
00:09:34,071 --> 00:09:35,240
no one else is here. Get in.

218
00:09:39,471 --> 00:09:40,072
Miss Song.

219
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:43,912
Did you

220
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:45,232
not sleep well last night?

221
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:46,912
Or have you faced difficulties?

222
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,176
He,

223
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:56,711
don't lose heart.

224
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,872
Don't listen to those rumors.

225
00:09:59,352 --> 00:10:00,431
I'll definitely find a way

226
00:10:00,632 --> 00:10:01,352
to cure you.

227
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:04,311
He,

228
00:10:04,512 --> 00:10:06,071
I... I didn't mean to

229
00:10:06,112 --> 00:10:07,032
touch your sore spot.

230
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:07,880
Anyway,

231
00:10:10,632 --> 00:10:11,992
what I want to say is

232
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:13,791
I won't disdain you.

233
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:15,528
In my heart,

234
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:16,488
you're the true warrior

235
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:17,608
and a real hero.

236
00:10:18,112 --> 00:10:18,752
He,

237
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:20,200
you can definitely be cured.

238
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:21,152
Stay strong.

239
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:25,831
M-Miss Song.

240
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:34,671
Xiao Jue, you ruined my reputation!

241
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:44,584
You ruined

242
00:10:44,831 --> 00:10:45,632
my reputation!

243
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:48,632
Now the news of my inadequacy has spread

244
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,551
throughout Yezhou Garrison.

245
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:52,311
They all look at me

246
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:53,711
as if mourning a death.

247
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:54,831
Xiao Jue,

248
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:56,296
you must take full responsibility

249
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:57,311
for this.

250
00:10:58,711 --> 00:10:59,551
Get me a single room

251
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:00,551
to have some peace.

252
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:12,831
Blaming me now?

253
00:11:14,352 --> 00:11:15,352
If not for me last night,

254
00:11:16,352 --> 00:11:17,288
what identity

255
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:18,831
would you use to stay

256
00:11:18,831 --> 00:11:19,912
in Yezhou Garrison?

257
00:11:22,352 --> 00:11:23,496
Naturally

258
00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:26,232
as your personal guard.

259
00:11:28,512 --> 00:11:29,352
Or

260
00:11:29,711 --> 00:11:30,992
do you want me to say

261
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:32,671
I'm your

262
00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:35,791
beloved?

263
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:45,032
I said I'd consider it.

264
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:46,912
You're biting the feeding...

265
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:48,648
kicking the ladder.

266
00:11:58,272 --> 00:11:58,831
I don't care.

267
00:12:00,232 --> 00:12:01,112
I've decided.

268
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:02,272
I'm yours now.

269
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,112
Treat me nicer.

270
00:12:03,152 --> 00:12:04,311
Love and protect me. Okay?

271
00:12:05,112 --> 00:12:06,071
I'm not leaving.

272
00:12:26,632 --> 00:12:28,032
That's the partition in my tent.

273
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:29,912
Don't you want peace?

274
00:12:30,632 --> 00:12:31,152
Live there

275
00:12:31,711 --> 00:12:32,648
and serve as my guard.

276
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:34,872
No one will disturb you.

277
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:43,208
Really?

278
00:12:48,232 --> 00:12:48,912
Thank you.

279
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,232
Commander, you should eat more

280
00:12:51,232 --> 00:12:52,032
to nourish yourself.

281
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:55,632
I'll take my leave.

282
00:12:58,071 --> 00:12:59,071
Good morning, Mr. Feinu.

283
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:00,272
M-Morning.

284
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:03,471
Commander,

285
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:05,232
what happened to him?

286
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:07,191
He wanted a single room.

287
00:13:07,831 --> 00:13:08,471
I granted it.

288
00:13:09,632 --> 00:13:10,872
Perhaps he's just happy

289
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,392
for that.

290
00:13:13,831 --> 00:13:14,431
A single room?

291
00:13:15,152 --> 00:13:16,431
The new recruits' camp has that?

292
00:13:23,311 --> 00:13:24,456
You put him there?

293
00:13:28,112 --> 00:13:29,152
Only to keep him close

294
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,752
can I observe his tricks better.

295
00:14:16,546 --> 00:14:18,824
(Essentials of Military Strategy)

296
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,840
Having prepared so thoroughly,

297
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:31,032
he must've planned long ago

298
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:32,512
to watch me fall to the trap.

299
00:14:57,128 --> 00:14:57,632
Com...

300
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:01,512
Xiao Jue!

301
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,632
That's outrageous.

302
00:15:05,632 --> 00:15:06,912
Such tight security?

303
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:08,232
Strangers would

304
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:09,551
think I'm

305
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:10,632
a rake sneaking

306
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:11,591
into boudoirs at night!

307
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:47,191
Commander?

308
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:51,071
Commander?

309
00:15:52,272 --> 00:15:53,256
Are you asleep?

310
00:15:56,352 --> 00:15:57,392
I can't sleep.

311
00:15:58,311 --> 00:15:59,112
How about

312
00:15:59,872 --> 00:16:01,071
we chat for a while?

313
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:11,431
Commander,

314
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:14,232
I know you don't trust me.

315
00:16:14,951 --> 00:16:16,431
That's why you placed me here.

316
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:28,328
Commander,

317
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:29,992
after all,

318
00:16:29,992 --> 00:16:31,311
we've shared hardships together.

319
00:16:33,112 --> 00:16:34,791
Why do you still suspect me?

320
00:16:39,992 --> 00:16:40,671
Commander,

321
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:42,992
I know about the enmity between

322
00:16:42,992 --> 00:16:43,951
you and He Rufei.

323
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,591
Since his plot failed in Yezhou City,

324
00:16:49,152 --> 00:16:50,872
he's surely plotting another scheme.

325
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:55,400
Commander,

326
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,152
rest assured.

327
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,551
I'll always stand by your side

328
00:16:59,112 --> 00:16:59,951
and protect you.

329
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:01,791
I'm the top one of Yezhou Garrison.

330
00:17:02,392 --> 00:17:03,152
One day,

331
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:04,471
you'll trust me.

332
00:17:04,912 --> 00:17:05,592
Then,

333
00:17:05,912 --> 00:17:07,231
we'll fight side by side,

334
00:17:07,511 --> 00:17:08,632
defending our land

335
00:17:08,872 --> 00:17:09,552
and our people,

336
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:11,552
so none dare threaten Wei.

337
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:37,392
Commander,

338
00:17:39,231 --> 00:17:40,912
the moon tonight is breathtaking.

339
00:17:42,112 --> 00:17:43,392

(Account Book)

357
00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:16,520
(Records of payoffs and gifts
for Chancellor Xu and his family)

358
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:31,991
Master,

359
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:33,991
I retrieved only a few copies.

360
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:36,231
I'm not sure if they're complete.

361
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:38,671
I wanted to revisit

362
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:39,471
Sun Xiangfu's room.

363
00:20:40,392 --> 00:20:41,912
But Xiao Jue's sudden move

364
00:20:42,552 --> 00:20:43,951
got the Sun residence sealed.

365
00:20:44,751 --> 00:20:46,031
I dared not alert them further,

366
00:20:46,991 --> 00:20:47,872
so I stopped looking.

367
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:52,191
Well,

368
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,352
I'm not blaming you.

369
00:20:54,991 --> 00:20:55,912
This trip

370
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,511
must have been arduous.

371
00:20:58,872 --> 00:20:59,912
It's my honor

372
00:21:00,112 --> 00:21:01,112
to ease your burdens.

373
00:21:07,072 --> 00:21:08,552
My lord, General Feihong is here.

374
00:21:09,991 --> 00:21:11,832
Take him to the reception hall.

375
00:21:11,832 --> 00:21:12,712
Yes, my lord.

376
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:15,552
You have a guest.

377
00:21:16,152 --> 00:21:17,511
I won't disturb you further.

378
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:20,152
Zilan,

379
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,231
I'm old.

380
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,112
I don't understand young people's ways.

381
00:21:27,592 --> 00:21:28,832
Some words

382
00:21:29,392 --> 00:21:30,872
are better left unspoken.

383
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,152
My lord,

384
00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:42,792
I sent assassins to Yezhou
to kill Xiao Jue

385
00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:44,912
to share your burden.

386
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:46,431
But

387
00:21:46,711 --> 00:21:47,511
I never expected...

388
00:21:50,231 --> 00:21:50,832
My lord,

389
00:21:51,431 --> 00:21:52,471
I admit my mistake.

390
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:09,392
Master,

391
00:22:10,231 --> 00:22:10,951
Ding Yi

392
00:22:11,191 --> 00:22:12,991
grew up with General He since childhood

393
00:22:13,312 --> 00:22:14,312
like brothers.

394
00:22:14,872 --> 00:22:15,752
Surely,

395
00:22:17,191 --> 00:22:18,632
he'll be as reliable

396
00:22:18,632 --> 00:22:19,471
as General He

397
00:22:20,751 --> 00:22:22,271
and leave no traces for Xiao Jue.

398
00:22:22,696 --> 00:22:23,272
Well...

399
00:22:23,352 --> 00:22:24,392
That's right.

400
00:22:25,312 --> 00:22:26,344
My lord, rest assured.

401
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,632
Ding Yi is meticulous.

402
00:22:27,912 --> 00:22:29,191
He'll never give Xiao Jue

403
00:22:29,352 --> 00:22:30,431
any opportunity.

404
00:22:34,832 --> 00:22:35,552
Enough.

405
00:22:37,271 --> 00:22:38,511
Since this matter

406
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:40,352
left no consequences,

407
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,751
let it end here.

408
00:22:43,312 --> 00:22:44,031
Thank you.

409
00:22:49,072 --> 00:22:50,231
This world

410
00:22:50,832 --> 00:22:53,751
abounds with hidden talents.

411
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:56,231
But without mentors to recognize them,

412
00:22:56,632 --> 00:22:59,112
they remain buried in obscurity,

413
00:22:59,231 --> 00:23:00,592
unknown to all.

414
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,029
(General Feihong's Mansion)

415
00:23:22,072 --> 00:23:24,031
Why are you still
involved with Chancellor Xu?

416
00:23:24,191 --> 00:23:25,031
Don't you know...

417
00:23:33,951 --> 00:23:34,592
Rufei,

418
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:36,951
since our family

419
00:23:37,231 --> 00:23:38,552
has secured wealth and status,

420
00:23:38,991 --> 00:23:40,552
we should withdraw while we can.

421
00:23:41,152 --> 00:23:42,431
Do you think Chancellor Xu would

422
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:43,711
ever let me withdraw unscathed?

423
00:23:45,872 --> 00:23:46,431
Father,

424
00:23:47,352 --> 00:23:49,072
you thought his earlier neglect

425
00:23:49,352 --> 00:23:50,751
meant mercy?

426
00:23:52,112 --> 00:23:53,112
He was merely preparing

427
00:23:53,112 --> 00:23:54,912
to sacrifice me like a pawn.

428
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:11,352
Young Master,

429
00:24:11,671 --> 00:24:12,511
wasn't the ledger

430
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:13,592
given to Chancellor Xu?

431
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:15,231
Why another copy?

432
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,872
(Account Book)
I transcribed some crucial records.

433
00:24:17,872 --> 00:24:19,352
The amount is appalling.

434
00:24:20,711 --> 00:24:22,312
I never imagined Master would embezzle

435
00:24:22,912 --> 00:24:23,912
so many

436
00:24:24,312 --> 00:24:25,751
military provisions and funds

437
00:24:26,152 --> 00:24:27,191
behind His Majesty's back.

438
00:24:52,072 --> 00:24:52,711
Aconite.

439
00:24:53,471 --> 00:24:54,312
Schisandra berries.

440
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,031
Commander,

441
00:25:14,271 --> 00:25:15,944
this is the urgent news from Litai,

442
00:25:16,328 --> 00:25:17,960
(Wutuo people have been)
saying Wutuo people have been

443
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,208
(harassing Litai lately)
harassing them lately.

444
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:21,392
Litai's magistrate
requests your military aid

445
00:25:21,592 --> 00:25:22,431
to repel them.

446
00:25:25,511 --> 00:25:26,592
Go to Shen Han immediately.

447
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:28,031
Have him muster 5,000 men

448
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:30,231
to assemble at the training field
at dawn tomorrow

449
00:25:30,711 --> 00:25:32,392
to depart for Litai with me.

450
00:25:32,751 --> 00:25:34,552
Commander, Wutuo people are fierce.

451
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,191
Yezhou Garrison's new recruits

452
00:25:36,271 --> 00:25:37,392
won't stand against them.

453
00:25:37,951 --> 00:25:39,112
Shall the battalion join us?

454
00:25:39,511 --> 00:25:40,040
Yes.

455
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:41,672
And He Yan?

456
00:25:48,191 --> 00:25:48,711
No need.

457
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:49,832
Get prepared first.

458
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:50,856
Have Ma Damei

459
00:25:51,072 --> 00:25:51,832
watch that person.

460
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:53,128
Yes.

461
00:26:22,312 --> 00:26:22,856
Commander?

462
00:26:23,632 --> 00:26:24,392
Why are you here?

463
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:48,191
Why did the wound reopen?

464
00:26:48,552 --> 00:26:50,832
The wound was hard to reach
and apply medicine to.

465
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:52,511
It reopened easily.

466
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:53,671
Let me do it.

467
00:27:28,632 --> 00:27:29,991
As Yezhou Garrison's top one,

468
00:27:31,152 --> 00:27:32,671
you've made yourself all wounded.

469
00:27:33,711 --> 00:27:34,912
And you vowed to protect me?

470
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:37,112
Commander,

471
00:27:37,352 --> 00:27:38,072
so you heard

472
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,072
everything that night?

473
00:27:39,312 --> 00:27:39,912
Why didn't you

474
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:40,951
answer me?

475
00:27:41,912 --> 00:27:42,832
Duties kept me busy.

476
00:27:43,592 --> 00:27:44,632
No time for your antics.

477
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:46,671
Well, Commander,

478
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:48,271
let me accompany you

479
00:27:48,392 --> 00:27:49,671
to Litai tomorrow.

480
00:27:50,191 --> 00:27:51,511
I promised to protect you

481
00:27:51,872 --> 00:27:53,031
and I won't break that vow.

482
00:27:54,711 --> 00:27:56,152
Focus on recovering properly.

483
00:27:57,392 --> 00:27:58,271
Or else I might

484
00:27:58,431 --> 00:27:59,832
end up protecting you instead.

485
00:28:03,152 --> 00:28:03,792
Fine.

486
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:05,511
Then go with peace of mind.

487
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:07,191
Yezhou Garrison has me.

488
00:28:59,751 --> 00:29:00,312
Done.

489
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:09,416
Commander,

490
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:10,112
wait a moment.

491
00:29:10,392 --> 00:29:11,312
I have a gift for you.

492
00:29:17,312 --> 00:29:17,832
Commander,

493
00:29:18,112 --> 00:29:19,231
these are osmanthus candies.

494
00:29:19,352 --> 00:29:19,912
They're sweet.

495
00:29:20,112 --> 00:29:20,912
Eat them on the way.

496
00:29:21,872 --> 00:29:23,112
Do accept them this time.

497
00:29:40,552 --> 00:29:41,471
The moon that night

498
00:29:45,511 --> 00:29:46,152
was beautiful.

499
00:30:14,872 --> 00:30:15,471
Commander,

500
00:30:16,152 --> 00:30:17,064
are you there?

501
00:30:47,832 --> 00:30:48,712
In the past,

502
00:30:49,632 --> 00:30:50,728
he always loved

503
00:30:50,728 --> 00:30:51,951
eating osmanthus candies.

504
00:30:55,112 --> 00:30:55,632
Never mind.

505
00:30:55,912 --> 00:30:57,431
At least he accepted them this time.

506
00:31:22,431 --> 00:31:23,072
(Xiao Jue,)

507
00:31:24,152 --> 00:31:25,431
(you must return safely.)

508
00:31:26,392 --> 00:31:29,152
(And Yezhou Garrison has me.)

509
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,751
Good morning, Commander.

510
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:09,320
Right.

511
00:32:09,951 --> 00:32:10,552
It's late.

512
00:32:11,231 --> 00:32:13,471
They should've covered
half the distance by now

513
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:15,152
and be approaching Litai soon.

514
00:32:23,271 --> 00:32:24,231
This must be

515
00:32:24,271 --> 00:32:25,832
from Miss Song.

516
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:27,511
Where is she?

517
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,231
Even if He can't swallow his pride
to take my medicine,

518
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:37,671
it's fine.

519
00:32:38,552 --> 00:32:39,711
I won't give up.

520
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,024
I've drafted a prescription.

521
00:32:42,951 --> 00:32:44,112
Once I gather the herbs,

522
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:46,112
I can develop

523
00:32:46,352 --> 00:32:48,152
a medicine
that enhances physical fitness.

524
00:32:49,231 --> 00:32:49,991
By then,

525
00:32:49,991 --> 00:32:51,271
it'll cure all his ailments.

526
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:53,392
And that

527
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:55,432
arrogant Cheng Lisu.

528
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:56,671
This time I'll

529
00:32:56,991 --> 00:32:57,991
wipe off his smug look.

530
00:33:17,191 --> 00:33:17,751
Someone!

531
00:33:18,112 --> 00:33:19,191
Give me a hand. Hurry up!

532
00:33:29,072 --> 00:33:30,191
He is seriously injured.

533
00:33:41,392 --> 00:33:42,392
Instead of fussing here,

534
00:33:42,951 --> 00:33:44,592
why not tend to your own wounds?

535
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:46,271
So nosy.

536
00:33:51,191 --> 00:33:51,991
Given his attire,

537
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:53,431
he is from an ethnic tribe.

538
00:34:16,232 --> 00:34:17,480
We should've done 60 li daily.

539
00:34:18,111 --> 00:34:20,672
But we've only managed
over 20 li after half the day.

540
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:22,312
The road is too muddy.

541
00:34:25,312 --> 00:34:25,872
Mr. Liang.

542
00:34:26,344 --> 00:34:26,962
Hmm.

543
00:34:29,392 --> 00:34:29,960
Commander,

544
00:34:30,872 --> 00:34:32,272
this man says he has urgent news.

545
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:35,111
Greetings, Commander.

546
00:34:35,511 --> 00:34:36,072
What is it?

547
00:34:36,712 --> 00:34:38,232
When I rushed from Litai to Yezhou,

548
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:39,712
the main road 30 li ahead

549
00:34:39,792 --> 00:34:40,712
had already collapsed.

550
00:34:41,151 --> 00:34:42,312
It made the journey harder.

551
00:34:43,752 --> 00:34:44,832
Any alternate routes?

552
00:34:45,631 --> 00:34:46,471
I know

553
00:34:46,471 --> 00:34:47,352
a shortcut to Litai.

554
00:34:47,591 --> 00:34:48,792
It might shorten our travel.

555
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:01,752
Okay.

556
00:35:02,232 --> 00:35:03,111
You lead the way then.

557
00:35:03,511 --> 00:35:04,591
We'll detour and proceed.

558
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:06,031
Yes.

559
00:35:15,431 --> 00:35:16,104
Yes.

560
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:32,551
You go over there.

561
00:35:39,232 --> 00:35:40,392
This year's plum blossoms

562
00:35:40,551 --> 00:35:41,912
bloomed earlier than before.

563
00:35:42,591 --> 00:35:43,631
I suppose this winter

564
00:35:43,712 --> 00:35:44,792
is colder than usual.

565
00:35:50,872 --> 00:35:51,471
Chu Zhao.

566
00:36:01,991 --> 00:36:03,111
Are you here to see me?

567
00:36:04,272 --> 00:36:05,752
I came to pay respects to Master.

568
00:36:09,672 --> 00:36:11,272
Of course, I must greet you as well.

569
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:14,184
Go.

570
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:14,991
Pick those twigs

571
00:36:14,991 --> 00:36:16,328
with the finest blossoms.

572
00:36:16,431 --> 00:36:17,272
Give them to Mr. Chu.

573
00:36:18,111 --> 00:36:18,792
Yes.

574
00:36:21,071 --> 00:36:21,672
That one.

575
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:34,192
Wretch!

576
00:36:34,752 --> 00:36:36,031
Can't even handle simple work!

577
00:36:41,591 --> 00:36:42,920
These were meant for you,

578
00:36:43,431 --> 00:36:44,471
