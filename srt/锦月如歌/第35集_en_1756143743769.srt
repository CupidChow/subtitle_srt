(Xiao Zhongwu, Song Wan)
Father, Mother.

24
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:48,139
I cannot abandon the Xiao Army.

25
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:51,699
Nor can I be her obstacle.

26
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:56,338
If we're not destined to be a couple,

27
00:02:00,178 --> 00:02:01,258
then I'd rather be

28
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:03,939
single and alone.

00:02:07,803 --> 00:02:13,448
(Virtues' Enduring Legacy)

30
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:18,379
Your Majesty.

31
00:02:18,498 --> 00:02:19,338
Shall I

32
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:20,819
change it with fresh flowers?

33
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,898
I ruined Xiao Jue and He Yan's marriage.

34
00:02:33,658 --> 00:02:34,498
They

35
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:38,218
must hold resentment toward me.

36
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:39,979
I suppose

37
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:42,618
you have your reasons, Your Majesty.

38
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:45,299
The imperial court requires

39
00:02:46,618 --> 00:02:49,058
a balance.

40
00:02:50,178 --> 00:02:51,018
But now,

41
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,458
two powerful generals

42
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:56,099
seek to unite.

43
00:02:57,338 --> 00:02:58,218
How could I

44
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,778
rest easy with this?

45
00:03:02,938 --> 00:03:05,898
Their grievances were predictable.

46
00:03:09,658 --> 00:03:10,738
Since that's the case,

47
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:15,219
I shall

48
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:17,299
make their division

49
00:03:18,058 --> 00:03:19,738
more absolute.

50
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:26,099
Your Majesty,

51
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,139
General Fengyun requests an audience.

52
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:41,064
(Xiao Mansion)

53
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,338
Your wedding gown
was rushed to completion.

54
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:45,299
It just arrived.

55
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:47,658
Quickly try it on.

56
00:03:47,898 --> 00:03:48,898
If it doesn't fit,

57
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:49,778
we'll alter it.

58
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:52,379
Come on.

59
00:03:53,178 --> 00:03:54,018
Come.

60
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:57,498
The embroidery and fabric

61
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:58,618
are truly first-rate.

62
00:03:59,218 --> 00:04:00,178
Huaijin is thoughtful.

63
00:04:05,938 --> 00:04:07,498
But this dress looks so complicated.

64
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:09,139
How do I wear it?

65
00:04:10,738 --> 00:04:11,579
Don't worry.

66
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:12,458
We'll help you.

67
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:13,458
Go try it.

68
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:28,619
Miss He looks stunning.

69
00:04:29,658 --> 00:04:31,019
Huaijin chose well.

70
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,778
In Yaojing, these past years,

71
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:33,978
no bride's gown

72
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:35,459
could compare to

73
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:37,978
what you're wearing now.

74
00:04:40,658 --> 00:04:41,819
Truly magnificent.

75
00:04:44,338 --> 00:04:45,178
Rongwei.

76
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,058
Miss He.

77
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:47,419
Huaijin has returned.

78
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:50,418
Let him try his attire alone.

79
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:51,259
Right now,

80
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:53,858
he shouldn't see
the bride's full ensemble.

81
00:04:56,619 --> 00:04:58,139
He's returned with an imperial edict.

82
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,298
Xiao Jue.

83
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:17,658
Is anything wrong?

84
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,858
He Yan, heed the decree.

85
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:30,059
His Majesty

86
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:31,899
decrees that

87
00:05:32,418 --> 00:05:33,258
He Yan,

88
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:34,338
a scholar and warrior,

89
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:35,658
has done great feats,

90
00:05:36,298 --> 00:05:37,138
protecting Jiyang,

91
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,219
defending Rundu,

92
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:39,939
and repelling Wutuo.

93
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:41,658
For her contributions,

94
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,699
she is granted
the Mansion of General Feihong.

95
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:48,579
May she continue
exceeding my expectations

96
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:50,139
with tireless dedication

97
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:52,059
and loyalty.

98
00:05:59,218 --> 00:06:00,418
- Thank...
- Another edict.

99
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:15,579
General Feihong,

100
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,298
He Yan,

101
00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:19,699
has noble character

102
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,259
and dual expertise.

103
00:06:23,179 --> 00:06:24,978
Lord Shijin's son,

104
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,019
Chu Zhao, Vice Director

105
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:28,498
of the Secretariat,

106
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:30,338
has honorable bearing

107
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:32,939
and exceptional talent.

108
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:34,859
They are

109
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:37,298
a most fitting match.

110
00:06:38,338 --> 00:06:39,338
By imperial decree,

111
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:41,059
the two shall wed

112
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,338
(Imperial Edict)
on a day

113
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:45,979
of good fortune.

114
00:06:49,739 --> 00:06:50,699
That's all.

115
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,819
He Yan narrowly escaped death

116
00:06:56,498 --> 00:06:58,699
to reclaim the General Feihong title.

117
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:01,098
Forcing her to abandon it

118
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:02,939
would erase

119
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:04,338
her very essence.

120
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:06,978
The Xiao Army

121
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:10,259
is my father's life's work

122
00:07:11,658 --> 00:07:13,059
and remains my duty.

123
00:07:14,098 --> 00:07:15,298
Let me let go.

124
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:17,418
Then I

125
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:19,939
cannot remain myself.

126
00:07:22,298 --> 00:07:23,138
It seems

127
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:25,699
you've made your choice.

128
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:29,059
You left me no other choice.

129
00:07:31,778 --> 00:07:34,098
I shall have you perform another task.

130
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:36,019
This marriage decree.

131
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,019
You shall personally deliver.

132
00:07:48,338 --> 00:07:49,178
No,

133
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:52,058
I won't.

134
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:53,619
You are defying my order?

135
00:08:01,098 --> 00:08:02,179
Please

136
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:04,579
punish me.

137
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:05,539
You...

138
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,418
Aren't you afraid of

139
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:33,019
dragging down your family?

140
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:46,859
If that's your order,

141
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:51,459
I obey.

142
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:06,179
What did you say?

143
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:11,259
Repeat that.

144
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,778
You broke plum branches

145
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:25,298
and made bridal attire for me.

146
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:28,619
In the end,

147
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:32,859

00:13:20,898 --> 00:13:21,738
At ease.

195
00:13:22,298 --> 00:13:23,138
Perfect timing.

196
00:13:23,859 --> 00:13:25,499
She wants me to retract my decree,

197
00:13:26,938 --> 00:13:28,499
but it's inappropriate.

198
00:13:29,739 --> 00:13:30,579
Your Majesty,

199
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:32,859
I will cherish He Yan wholeheartedly

200
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,019
and make her understand my sincerity.

201
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:36,099
Given time...

202
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:37,099
This is unnecessary.

203
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:41,179
Your Majesty,

204
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:42,418
I know

205
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:44,499
you just want to prevent

206
00:13:44,979 --> 00:13:46,859
a marriage between two military leaders.

207
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:50,658
I won't marry Xiao Jue.

208
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:54,258
But

209
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:55,578
I won't marry Chu Zhao either.

210
00:13:56,898 --> 00:13:57,738
Outrageous!

211
00:14:00,979 --> 00:14:02,019
Please calm your anger.

212
00:14:02,658 --> 00:14:03,498
I

213
00:14:03,698 --> 00:14:04,619
won't defy the decree,

214
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,099
but I refuse to settle.

215
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:11,139
If I can't spend my life
with the one I love,

216
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:13,259
I would rather

217
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,139
remain alone forever.

218
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,698
Please grant me.

219
00:14:25,058 --> 00:14:25,898
Your Majesty,

220
00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:29,938
if He Yan

221
00:14:30,698 --> 00:14:32,019
refuses to marry Chu Zhao,

222
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:35,619
I implore you

223
00:14:37,658 --> 00:14:38,979
to grant her

224
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:41,818
a choice.

225
00:14:53,538 --> 00:14:54,378
Fine.

226
00:14:57,778 --> 00:14:59,219
Have it your way.

227
00:15:09,578 --> 00:15:10,418
I shall

228
00:15:10,698 --> 00:15:11,538
take my leave.

229
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:27,538
(Have I)

230
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:30,259
(truly erred?)

231
00:15:35,938 --> 00:15:36,898
Were you involved in

232
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:39,658
this arranged marriage?

233
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:43,898
Yes.

234
00:15:45,739 --> 00:15:46,698
I requested it.

235
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:50,979
But Xiao Jue still dumped you.

236
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,859
You're an intelligent man.

237
00:15:57,859 --> 00:15:59,099
You should understand

238
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:01,538
that decree cannot constrain me.

239
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:03,339
We were never

240
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:06,499
in the cards.

241
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:08,778
There's no future

242
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:10,619
for you two.

243
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:13,178
Why not turn your eyes to me?

244
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,298
Can you not tell

245
00:16:14,298 --> 00:16:15,658
my heart is as true as his?

246
00:16:15,698 --> 00:16:16,778
That's not love.

247
00:16:18,298 --> 00:16:19,979
It was all a calculated game.

248
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:25,859
Should I cut open my heart?

249
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,219
Is a calculated heart any less worthy?

250
00:16:28,499 --> 00:16:29,339
Tell me!

251
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:30,579
You're insane!

252
00:16:32,178 --> 00:16:33,859
How much ambition is hidden

253
00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:37,698
behind the love you speak of?

254
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:39,698
Was every single thing you did

255
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:42,139
truly only for me?

256
00:16:42,658 --> 00:16:44,939
Stop deluding yourself, Chu Zhao.

257
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:47,459
I'm just

258
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:51,619
a pretty excuse for your ambition.

259
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:13,418
You know what?

260
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:16,778
You're becoming another Xu Jingfu.

261
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,504
(Chu Mansion)

262
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,739
Miss Xu, your meal is served.

263
00:18:14,538 --> 00:18:15,899
Chu Zhao had you send these

264
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:17,818
for me to eat?

265
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:19,778
You're overthinking, Miss Xu.

266
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:21,338
Our young master

267
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:22,339
is extremely busy.

268
00:18:22,578 --> 00:18:24,058
He has no time to care about it.

269
00:18:26,378 --> 00:18:27,499
You wretched maid.

270
00:18:27,818 --> 00:18:28,658
You!

271
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:30,618
Still acting high and mighty?

272
00:18:30,858 --> 00:18:31,698
Listen up.

273
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,138
His Majesty has decreed

274
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,659
a marriage between our young master

275
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:35,539
and General Feihong.

276
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:37,138
Abandon your foolish hopes.

277
00:18:37,338 --> 00:18:38,178
What did you say?

278
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:40,098
Chu Zhao is marrying He Yan?

279
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:42,659
Y-Yes.

280
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:44,259
The news has spread everywhere.

281
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:54,778
No way.

282
00:18:55,538 --> 00:18:56,378
Chu Zhao,

283
00:18:57,618 --> 00:18:58,979
you won't get your way.

284
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:13,899
Have you met with Miss He?

285
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:15,819
How about

286
00:19:16,298 --> 00:19:17,138
your marriage?

287
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:19,578
There will be no marriage.

288
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:22,058
Don't bring it up.

289
00:19:45,778 --> 00:19:47,858
I heard about
your imperial marriage decree

290
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,538
and came specially to congratulate you.

291
00:19:56,138 --> 00:19:58,419
Why the haste, Mr. Chu?

292
00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:03,378
I once thought

293
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:06,058
only fools like me

294
00:20:06,818 --> 00:20:08,378
would cling to unrequited feelings,

295
00:20:09,138 --> 00:20:10,219
be used by others

296
00:20:10,858 --> 00:20:12,899
and then discarded like trash.

297
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:14,578
I never imagined

298
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,058
that a shrewd man

299
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:20,058
like you could also

300
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:23,298
experience unrequited desires.

301
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:26,859
Miss Xu,

302
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,019
if you continue this outburst,

303
00:20:29,298 --> 00:20:30,778
I'll have to ask you to leave.

304
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:32,899
If you're done venting,

305
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:34,459
I'll arrange your return.

306
00:20:40,298 --> 00:20:41,259
Return?

307
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:44,298
Return where?

308
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:47,179
You killed my father.

309
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:49,219
My family home is sealed.

310
00:20:50,338 --> 00:20:52,298
I have neither a home nor a father.

311
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,899
Even the lowest servants
look down on me.

312
00:20:55,578 --> 00:20:56,499
You tell me to return.

313
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:59,378
Tell me where I should go.

314
00:21:00,098 --> 00:21:01,659
Where should I go? Tell me.

315
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:02,499
Tell me!

316
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:06,898
Miss Xu.

317
00:21:09,578 --> 00:21:10,418
What?

318
00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:12,858
You think yourself the greatest victim?

319
00:21:13,778 --> 00:21:16,058
What of those sold into slavery
and forced to grovel?

320
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:18,298
Or those displaced
and begging on the streets?

321
00:21:18,939 --> 00:21:20,138
Your father's death

322
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:22,858
was nothing but his deserved punishment.

323
00:21:23,338 --> 00:21:26,058
You still live in luxury.

324
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:28,739
Only deprived of your former status.

325
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:32,058
And you're whining now?

326
00:21:36,818 --> 00:21:37,778
You deceived me,

327
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:39,458
betrayed me,

328
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:40,859
and dumped me.

329
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:43,419
But I'd let it all slide.

330
00:21:45,858 --> 00:21:48,058
How could you betray my father?

331
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,578
He may have been a monster to the world,

332
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:55,739
but he never did you any harm.

333
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:00,098
In this situation,

334
00:22:00,979 --> 00:22:02,659
you still act superior.

335
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:06,259
I don't know if this is pitiful

336
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:08,939
or laughable.

337
00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:14,299

Guards!

345
00:22:57,298 --> 00:22:59,259
Go fetch a physician. Hurry!

346
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:00,099
Yes.

347
00:23:01,818 --> 00:23:02,658
Yingxiang.

348
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:04,099
It's okay, Yingxiang.

349
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:06,219
It's okay. Don't worry, Yingxiang.

350
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,059
You will be okay.

351
00:23:07,699 --> 00:23:08,539
I

352
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:10,299
don't fear.

353
00:23:13,298 --> 00:23:14,338
I only fear

354
00:23:16,138 --> 00:23:17,019
in the world,

355
00:23:19,778 --> 00:23:21,699
you'll end up alone.

356
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:28,459
From now on,

357
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:32,219
stop pushing yourself so hard.

358
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:37,859
Spare...

359

Spare yourself.
