Offer incense.

25
00:02:38,453 --> 00:02:41,374
Present jade and silk.

Kneel.

00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:57,733
Bow.

28
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:00,574
Rise.

Rise.

Bow thrice.

32
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:17,213
Rise.

33
00:03:18,814 --> 00:03:20,254
Get up.

34
00:03:22,893 --> 00:03:24,773
The winter sacrificial ceremony
is concluded.

35
00:03:24,974 --> 00:03:26,694
Officials,

36
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:29,733
please proceed to Longtai Hall.

37
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:39,974
Yan He.

38
00:03:40,574 --> 00:03:41,453
When did you arrive?

39
00:03:42,254 --> 00:03:44,053
I always thought
you were short and thin,

40
00:03:44,254 --> 00:03:45,694
but never expected you were a woman.

41
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:47,854
Well...

42
00:03:48,254 --> 00:03:49,694
Do you look down on me

43
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:51,653
and disdain being friends with me

44
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,493
because I'm a woman now?

45
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:55,213
Do you think

46
00:03:55,254 --> 00:03:56,574
I am that kind of base person?

47
00:03:57,134 --> 00:03:57,893
I'm angry because

48
00:03:57,974 --> 00:03:59,333
you and Xiao Jue hid this from me.

49
00:04:00,213 --> 00:04:02,014
We had to.

50
00:04:02,134 --> 00:04:03,254
I didn't want to either.

51
00:04:04,134 --> 00:04:04,613
By the way,

52
00:04:05,294 --> 00:04:06,893
how is your wife recently?

53
00:04:07,493 --> 00:04:08,294
She's quite well.

54
00:04:08,893 --> 00:04:09,733
The baby

55
00:04:09,854 --> 00:04:10,933
has behaved.

56
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:17,053
But the Huayuan battle
turned out like this,

57
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,294
how dare He Rufei show his face here?

58
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:28,934
Excellent.

59
00:04:29,174 --> 00:04:30,293
Everyone is here.

60
00:04:31,254 --> 00:04:31,814
Let's go.

61
00:04:39,773 --> 00:04:42,054
Greetings, Your Majesty.

62
00:04:44,134 --> 00:04:45,333
Rise, everyone.

63
00:05:03,494 --> 00:05:04,773
I am Maningbu,

64
00:05:04,973 --> 00:05:06,973
greetings to Emperor Wei.

65
00:05:07,293 --> 00:05:09,174
You have traveled far,

66
00:05:09,254 --> 00:05:10,054
must be weary.

67
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,893
As a foreign envoy,

68
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:14,533
I've heard of

69
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:15,734
your ear for talent

70
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:16,934
and prudent governance.

71
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:18,614
What a model ruler of our age.

72
00:05:19,213 --> 00:05:21,054
I deeply respect you.

73
00:05:21,814 --> 00:05:22,694
Today,

74
00:05:22,853 --> 00:05:23,973
I want to offer you a toast.

75
00:05:28,973 --> 00:05:30,213
Your words

76
00:05:30,453 --> 00:05:32,054
are really flattering me.

77
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,814
Your generous hospitality

78
00:05:43,014 --> 00:05:45,374
really moves me.

79
00:05:45,694 --> 00:05:47,934
Wei and Wutuo are neighbors,

80
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,653
so we should share brotherly bonds

81
00:05:51,014 --> 00:05:52,254
as we do now in harmony.

82
00:05:52,574 --> 00:05:53,453
With this opportunity,

83
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:55,533
Wutuo wishes to ally with Wei,

84
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,734
bonding our relationship,

85
00:05:57,934 --> 00:05:59,374
and ending all conflicts.

86
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,093
If we can truly cease the war,

87
00:06:02,134 --> 00:06:03,374
nothing could be better.

88
00:06:03,574 --> 00:06:05,853
After our alliance is sealed

89
00:06:06,494 --> 00:06:07,893
and establish trade markets,

90
00:06:08,293 --> 00:06:09,853
I'm sure we can

91
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:12,174
get peace and benefits.

92
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:21,494
Regarding the trade markets,

93
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:26,333
details to be confirmed.

94
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:28,653
Please be more patient.

95
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:35,614
It seems Wei

96
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:37,694
lacks sincerity in facilitating

97
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:39,014
the alliance.

98
00:06:45,934 --> 00:06:46,533
What?

99
00:06:47,254 --> 00:06:49,213
We must let Wutuo gain all advantages

100
00:06:49,453 --> 00:06:50,853
to prove our sincerity?

101
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:01,653
Marquis Wu'an.

102
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:02,614
You are

103
00:07:02,694 --> 00:07:04,254
being too arrogant.

104
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:07,333
Whether the trade markets open

105
00:07:07,934 --> 00:07:09,054
is not

106
00:07:09,653 --> 00:07:10,934
for you to decide.

107
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:16,293
You fought Wutuo several times,

108
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:17,934
yet now you speak

109
00:07:17,934 --> 00:07:19,093
for Wutuo.

110
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:20,653
Have their blows made you

111
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:22,413
a turncoat now?

112
00:07:34,374 --> 00:07:34,973
Your Majesty,

113
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:36,973
when I led the Fuyue Army

114
00:07:36,973 --> 00:07:38,014
to quell rebellions,

115
00:07:38,093 --> 00:07:38,533
my goal

116
00:07:38,694 --> 00:07:40,574
was the Wei's prosperity and peace.

117
00:07:40,653 --> 00:07:41,973
My lifelong wish

118
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:43,054
is to safeguard

119
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:44,614
the Wei's land for you.

120
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:45,574
Apart from that,

121
00:07:45,614 --> 00:07:46,494
there's nothing more.

122
00:07:47,254 --> 00:07:49,093
Your Majesty, please trust

123
00:07:49,213 --> 00:07:50,734
my loyalty.

124
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:58,773
General Feihong is a loyal,

125
00:07:58,893 --> 00:08:00,054
peerless warrior unmatched

126
00:08:00,374 --> 00:08:01,333
by a thousand.

127
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,614
He would never

128
00:08:02,653 --> 00:08:03,773
commit acts of treason.

129
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,853
But the question remains:

130
00:08:07,014 --> 00:08:08,893
Are you General Feihong?

131
00:08:19,893 --> 00:08:21,574
Nonsense.

132
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:32,413
Your Majesty,

133
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:32,893
I have

134
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:35,293
to accuse He Rufei
of three major crimes.

135
00:08:48,614 --> 00:08:49,734
Three major crimes?

136
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:51,334
What do you mean?

137
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:58,334
First crime:

138
00:08:59,014 --> 00:09:00,134
Substitution fraud

139
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,214
by stealing General Feihong's identity.

140
00:09:02,813 --> 00:09:03,933
- What?
- What?

141
00:09:04,653 --> 00:09:05,614
Is this true?

142
00:09:06,173 --> 00:09:08,173
Please summon a witness.

143
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:10,094
This person can verify

144
00:09:10,214 --> 00:09:11,413
the truth of my claim.

145
00:09:12,494 --> 00:09:12,933
Summon!

146
00:09:13,573 --> 00:09:15,413
By the imperial decree,

147
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:16,974
summon him!

148
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:34,214
Commander of Rundu Li Kuang.

149
00:09:34,614 --> 00:09:35,653
Greetings, Your Majesty.

150
00:09:36,214 --> 00:09:37,734
So you're the Commander of Rundu

151
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:38,374
Li Kuang.

152
00:09:38,653 --> 00:09:39,573
In the Rundu battle,

153
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:41,014
you deserve recognition.

154
00:09:41,254 --> 00:09:42,014
Please rise.

155
00:09:42,334 --> 00:09:43,374
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

156
00:09:51,734 --> 00:09:52,293
(Commander,)

157
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,053
it's been days.

158
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:56,014
You are...

159
00:09:57,653 --> 00:09:58,293
He Yan?

160
00:09:58,734 --> 00:09:59,693
I'm He Yan

161
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:00,693
who fought

162
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,214
with you at Rundu.

163
00:10:05,134 --> 00:10:06,053
I am Li Kuang.

164
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:07,854
Greetings, General Feihong.

165
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,134
Commander Li.

166
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,134
You'd read

167
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:24,773
this letter after we leave.

168
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:32,214
Jujube and turtle...

169
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:33,413
Come back soon.

170
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:35,494
We Eight Warriors

171
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:36,693
were born into poverty.

172
00:10:37,693 --> 00:10:39,014
Most were illiterate,

173
00:10:40,813 --> 00:10:41,693
so we devised

174
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:42,974
such a crude method

175
00:10:43,014 --> 00:10:43,933
for communication.

176
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:45,533
These codes are

177
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:46,653
known only to us eight

178
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,173
and General Feihong.

179
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:51,053
Now seven were gone,

180
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:52,734
leaving only

181
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:53,734
me and

182
00:10:55,173 --> 00:10:56,893
General Feihong.

183
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:01,614
Rise.

184
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:03,254
I

185
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:05,014
am late.

186
00:11:06,653 --> 00:11:08,053
Sorry, General.

187
00:11:09,214 --> 00:11:10,053
Rise.

188
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:17,374
You're not late,

189
00:11:18,254 --> 00:11:19,413
but arrive in time.

190
00:11:27,293 --> 00:11:28,053
I

191
00:11:29,014 --> 00:11:29,974
dare not claim merit.

192
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:32,134
If not for General Fengyun

193
00:11:32,214 --> 00:11:33,854
and General Feihong's

194
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:34,773
timely aid,

195
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:36,214
Rundu's people

196
00:11:36,974 --> 00:11:38,454
would've been killed

197
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,134
by Wutuo.

198
00:11:44,254 --> 00:11:46,053
Li, explain yourself.

199
00:11:46,893 --> 00:11:48,053
The ones who saved Rundu

200
00:11:48,094 --> 00:11:49,053
were General Fengyun

201
00:11:49,094 --> 00:11:50,094
and Marquis Wu'an.

202
00:11:50,773 --> 00:11:52,254
Why mentioned General Feihong?

203
00:11:53,374 --> 00:11:54,653
Because

204
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:57,094
Marquis Wu'an

205
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,254
is the genuine General Feihong!

206
00:12:12,734 --> 00:12:13,494
General He,

207
00:12:14,254 --> 00:12:15,653
what do you have to say?

208
00:12:22,693 --> 00:12:23,734
Your Majesty,

209
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:25,854
this man conspires with He Yan

210
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:26,974
in a vile scheme

211
00:12:27,134 --> 00:12:28,494
to frame me!

212
00:12:29,494 --> 00:12:30,334
That's strange.

213
00:12:30,813 --> 00:12:32,533
Li Kuang served as your deputy,

214
00:12:32,773 --> 00:12:34,254
sharing life-and-death struggles

215
00:12:34,334 --> 00:12:35,374
and fighting with you.

216
00:12:36,134 --> 00:12:37,533
Why would he frame you now?

217
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,893
Perhaps in the Rundu Battle,

218
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:46,933
my late reinforcements

219
00:12:47,053 --> 00:12:49,413
angered him,

220
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:53,053
making him He Yan's pawn.

221
00:12:56,454 --> 00:12:57,094
He Rufei.

222
00:12:57,854 --> 00:12:58,773
Why didn't you save

223
00:12:58,813 --> 00:12:59,653
your former deputy?

224
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:13,734
His statements
are full of inconsistencies.

225
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:15,454
He's deliberately slandering me.

226
00:13:16,573 --> 00:13:17,374
I'm innocent!

227
00:13:17,693 --> 00:13:19,014
Please judge fairly.

228
00:13:22,254 --> 00:13:23,214
It seems you deny

229
00:13:23,254 --> 00:13:24,653
the first crime charge.

230
00:13:27,813 --> 00:13:28,494
Marquis Wu'an.

231
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:29,734
Second one.

232
00:13:33,653 --> 00:13:34,454
Second crime:

233
00:13:35,334 --> 00:13:36,653
To conceal his false identity,

234
00:13:37,293 --> 00:13:38,293
he eliminated

235
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:39,773
his comrades!

236
00:13:40,494 --> 00:13:41,214
I have evidence

237
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:42,813
to present.

238
00:13:46,053 --> 00:13:46,614
Get it to me.

239
00:13:46,813 --> 00:13:47,374
Yes.

240
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:59,077
(To Xiao Jue)

241
00:14:07,024 --> 00:14:10,886
(Assassination, in Chonghuai)

242
00:14:14,374 --> 00:14:16,134
The assassins outside Chonghuai.

243
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:17,653
General He,

244
00:14:18,214 --> 00:14:19,533
have you forgotten them?

245
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,254
My lord,

246
00:14:21,974 --> 00:14:22,773
we discovered

247
00:14:22,773 --> 00:14:23,734
tattooed markings on

248
00:14:23,854 --> 00:14:24,653
one assassin's body.

249
00:14:25,053 --> 00:14:26,254
He might be a former prisoner.

250
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,494
By tracing these markings,

251
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:31,813
we can determine

252
00:14:31,813 --> 00:14:33,134
when and where he was imprisoned,

253
00:14:33,494 --> 00:14:34,173
thus,

254
00:14:35,494 --> 00:14:37,293
we can know his real name

255
00:14:38,413 --> 00:14:39,773
and background.

256
00:14:41,573 --> 00:14:42,693
Yang Mingzhi has replied.

257
00:14:43,693 --> 00:14:45,134
He found the assassins' origins.

258
00:14:45,893 --> 00:14:47,254
They're linked to He Rufei.

259
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:48,533
So,

260
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,573
that tattooed assassin was

261
00:14:51,094 --> 00:14:53,134
a distant relative
of He Mansion's steward.

262
00:14:54,653 --> 00:14:55,813
They did everything

263
00:14:56,494 --> 00:14:58,374
to eliminate me.

264
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:00,053
You thought

265
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:02,014
that dead men

266
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,854
could tell nothing.

267
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:06,134
But traces can't be erased.

268
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:08,293
Dead men still tell us something.

269
00:15:13,214 --> 00:15:14,374
I don't know

270
00:15:14,773 --> 00:15:15,813
what you're talking about.

271
00:15:19,053 --> 00:15:20,214
Your steward

272
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,734
acted so recklessly,

273
00:15:22,494 --> 00:15:24,173
yet you know nothing?

274
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:27,573
I failed to supervise him.

275
00:15:27,734 --> 00:15:29,214
Your Majesty, forgive me.

276
00:15:31,454 --> 00:15:33,494
Besides repeated attempts to kill me,

277
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:34,974
in the Huayuan Battle,

278
00:15:36,014 --> 00:15:37,693
the Fuyue Army's Seven Tiger Generals

279
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:39,974
were ambushed and killed together.

280
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:41,933
It's another scheme

281
00:15:42,454 --> 00:15:43,693
by He Rufei!

282
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,454
Things change in the battlefields.

283
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:47,974
We have

284
00:15:48,293 --> 00:15:50,293
to be flexible.

285
00:15:52,374 --> 00:15:53,053
He Rufei.

286
00:15:53,893 --> 00:15:55,214
I don't care who you are.

287
00:15:55,813 --> 00:15:56,494
But you fought in

288
00:15:56,494 --> 00:15:57,334
the Huayuan Battle.

289
00:15:58,254 --> 00:15:59,134
Just tell me,

290
00:15:59,854 --> 00:16:01,254
did you truly abandon

291
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:02,573
thousands of soldiers

292
00:16:02,653 --> 00:16:03,773
for personal gain?

293
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:11,933
Punish He Rufei severely, Your Majesty!

294
00:16:12,734 --> 00:16:13,734
Avenge the unjustly slain

295
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,014
from the Huayuan Battle!

296
00:16:20,454 --> 00:16:23,533
Punish He Rufei severely, Your Majesty!

297
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:25,454
Avenge the unjustly slain

298
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:28,134
from the Huayuan Battle!

299
00:16:36,053 --> 00:16:37,053
Third crime:

300
00:16:38,014 --> 00:16:39,374
Colluding with Wutuo,

301
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:41,573
and treason against Wei!

302
00:16:55,693 --> 00:16:57,533
False accusations!

303
00:16:58,413 --> 00:16:59,053
He Yan.

304
00:17:00,014 --> 00:17:01,773
You have no evidence

305
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,293
at all.

306
00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:13,254
I do!

307
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:32,014
- It's her!
- Indeed.

308
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:37,934
(Why is she here?)

309
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:56,853
Your Majesty,

310
00:17:57,414 --> 00:17:58,293
these letters

311
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:00,613
are secretly hidden by He Rufei.

312
00:18:01,133 --> 00:18:02,333
And I stole them.

313
00:18:06,174 --> 00:18:07,174
They contain

314
00:18:08,214 --> 00:18:09,414
evidence

315
00:18:10,093 --> 00:18:11,974
of He Rufei's treason.

316
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:17,694
Get them to me.

317
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:24,613
A Madam He seeks audience

318
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:25,613
outside the hall.

319
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:26,694
Madam He?

320
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:27,734
Who's that?

321
00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:31,573
Bring her in.

322
00:18:32,214 --> 00:18:32,734
Yes.

323
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:42,894
I heard the Tianxing Platform

324
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:44,254
is about to hold a night banquet.

325
00:18:45,654 --> 00:18:47,014
These letters

326
00:18:47,053 --> 00:18:47,894
should prove helpful.

327
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:49,853
Thank you.

328
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:51,654
General Fengyun.

329
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:54,694
I have a favor to ask.

330
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:56,573
Please help me enter the palace,

331
00:18:57,014 --> 00:18:58,894
so I can present these letters myself.

332
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:00,254
No way.

333
00:19:01,293 --> 00:19:02,214
It'd be dangerous.

334
00:19:03,093 --> 00:19:03,734
Madam He.

335
00:19:04,174 --> 00:19:05,333
Don't get involved in it.

336
00:19:13,414 --> 00:19:14,533
Madam He, you don't need to.

337
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:15,694
General.

338
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:17,894
I'm doing this for Yan.

339
00:19:18,373 --> 00:19:19,974
I know Rufei resents her.

340
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:21,894
I watched them

341
00:19:21,934 --> 00:19:23,014
harmed her once,

342
00:19:23,093 --> 00:19:24,414
and I must stop them now.

343
00:19:25,974 --> 00:19:27,373
Please help me, General.

344
00:19:29,254 --> 00:19:29,813
Alright.

345
00:19:30,454 --> 00:19:31,414
I'll help you.

346
00:19:32,694 --> 00:19:33,694
Regarding the evidence,

347
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:36,533
please inform Yan

348
00:19:36,694 --> 00:19:37,533
to reassure her.

349
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:40,934
But don't tell her that I'd present

350
00:19:42,454 --> 00:19:43,894
the evidence myself.

351
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:54,333
Your Majesty.

352
00:19:54,773 --> 00:19:55,974
I can testify

353
00:19:57,214 --> 00:19:58,613
that my stepson He Rufei

354
00:19:59,694 --> 00:20:01,613
is not General Feihong at all.

355
00:20:02,573 --> 00:20:04,014
I'm the descendant of a scholar,

356
00:20:04,214 --> 00:20:05,934
living at home with my young daughter.

357
00:20:06,254 --> 00:20:08,454
He Yuansheng coveted
my family's reputation.

358
00:20:08,613 --> 00:20:10,014
Since my family had declined,

359
00:20:10,053 --> 00:20:11,373
he forced me into the He Mansion.

360
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:13,533
Unexpectedly, soon after,

361
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:15,694
He Rufei fell gravely ill.

362
00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:18,613
Physicians predicted he'd die early.

363
00:20:18,773 --> 00:20:20,373
He Yuansheng feared losing his title,

364
00:20:20,373 --> 00:20:22,333
yet couldn't bear to abandon his son.

365
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,133
He thought adopting a boy

366
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:26,174
might let him breed evil ambition,

367
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:27,254
and be hard to control.

368
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,174
So he made my daughter
disguised as a man

369
00:20:30,573 --> 00:20:32,414
and swap identities with He Rufei.

370
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:34,053
My daughter has been clever

371
00:20:34,053 --> 00:20:35,056
and favors martial arts.

372
00:20:35,373 --> 00:20:36,533
She joined the army early

373
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:38,053
and risked her life in battlefields,

374
00:20:38,694 --> 00:20:40,654
earning the title General Feihong.

375
00:20:40,934 --> 00:20:41,773
When she returned,

376
00:20:41,934 --> 00:20:43,613
Rufei had recovered fully.

377
00:20:44,773 --> 00:20:46,894
When Your Majesty awarded,

378
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:48,773
He Rufei was so greedy,

379
00:20:49,494 --> 00:20:50,654
and He Yuansheng feared

380
00:20:50,654 --> 00:20:52,053
He Yan would expose them,

381
00:20:52,053 --> 00:20:52,533
so...

382
00:20:54,214 --> 00:20:54,533
they...

383
00:20:55,934 --> 00:20:57,573
So they poisoned

384
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,053
and blinded her.

385
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:01,133
Later,

386
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:03,373
they silenced her.

387
00:21:03,974 --> 00:21:05,053
Your Majesty.

388
00:21:05,254 --> 00:21:06,293
My daughter He Yan

389
00:21:06,813 --> 00:21:08,894
is the genuine General Feihong!

390
00:21:09,293 --> 00:21:10,293
- This...
- What!

391
00:21:25,813 --> 00:21:26,454
What's wrong?

392
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:28,654
Don't trust her!

393
00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:29,573
Your Majesty.

394
00:21:29,573 --> 00:21:30,934
This woman is too sick

395
00:21:30,934 --> 00:21:32,293
to think clearly.

396
00:21:32,454 --> 00:21:33,254
What she said

397
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,373
is completely nonsense.

398
00:21:34,454 --> 00:21:35,214
I...

399
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:37,014
I was telling all the truth.

400
00:21:37,373 --> 00:21:38,613
Your Majesty, please trust me.

401
00:21:40,014 --> 00:21:41,214
I told no lies.

402
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,214
If I did,

403
00:21:43,414 --> 00:21:44,654
may lightning strike me,

404
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:46,533
and I'd die horribly,

405
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:49,133
descend to the netherworld,

406
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:50,694
and never to escape.

407
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:52,373
Your Majesty, please trust me.

408
00:21:53,414 --> 00:21:55,254
Hold justice for my daughter.

409
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:57,974
Your Majesty,

410
00:21:58,053 --> 00:21:59,055
please summon physicians!

411
00:21:59,414 --> 00:22:00,093
Go summon them!

412
00:22:00,214 --> 00:22:00,813
Yes.

413
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:02,373
Imperial physician!

414
00:22:02,414 --> 00:22:03,613
Your Majesty, please trust me.

415
00:22:04,813 --> 00:22:08,214
I was telling all the truth.

416
00:22:09,174 --> 00:22:10,894
I'll stake my life

417
00:22:12,734 --> 00:22:13,894
to prove it.

418
00:22:15,813 --> 00:22:16,694
Why?

419
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:18,494
As a mother,

420
00:22:18,494 --> 00:22:20,494
I tried to protect everything.

421
00:22:20,894 --> 00:22:22,174
Yet in the end,

422
00:22:23,454 --> 00:22:25,174
I failed to protect anything.

423
00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:26,853
A shameless person

424
00:22:28,573 --> 00:22:30,454
like me

425
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:32,454
doesn't deserve to live longer.

426
00:22:36,853 --> 00:22:37,533
Rufei,

427
00:22:53,613 --> 00:22:54,773
repent your sins.

428
00:22:55,813 --> 00:22:56,533
Rufei.

429
00:22:56,773 --> 00:22:57,494
Rufei.

430
00:22:58,053 --> 00:22:59,293
Repent your sins.

431
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:19,414
Ingrate!

432
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,174
Madam.

433
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,894
You're sick.

434
00:23:25,014 --> 00:23:27,174
Really sick!

435
00:23:38,454 --> 00:23:39,454
Your Majesty,

436
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:40,734
the poison has spread,

437
00:23:41,093 --> 00:23:42,293
and she is beyond cure.

438
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,014
Don't cry.

439
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,613
I'm not worth your tears.

440
00:23:58,734 --> 00:23:59,694
Mother.

441
00:24:02,613 --> 00:24:03,093
I...

442
00:24:03,894 --> 00:24:05,494
I finally heard

443
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:08,254
you call me Mother.

444
00:24:09,934 --> 00:24:10,974
Wonderful.

445
00:24:16,014 --> 00:24:20,414
Cloaked in lotus splendor,

446
00:24:21,813 --> 00:24:24,773
yet adrift without anchor.

447
00:24:26,014 --> 00:24:26,853
Yan.

448
00:24:29,494 --> 00:24:30,254
Live...

449
00:24:42,694 --> 00:24:43,734
Live

450
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:45,853
well.

451
00:25:03,694 --> 00:25:04,613
Mother!

452
00:25:09,813 --> 00:25:10,853
Monster!

453
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:16,454
Mother.

454
00:25:21,293 --> 00:25:22,974
Take Madam He away first.

455
00:25:23,494 --> 00:25:25,133
Let her rest in peace.

456
00:25:44,974 --> 00:25:45,734
Mother.

457
00:25:47,174 --> 00:25:47,773
He Yan.

458
00:26:11,773 --> 00:26:12,613
He Rufei.

459
00:26:13,494 --> 00:26:15,093
Though we're nominally siblings,

460
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,853
we're destined to fight.

461
00:26:26,014 --> 00:26:26,934
He Rufei!

462
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:30,174
You deceived me,

463
00:26:30,934 --> 00:26:32,573
falsely claimed official titles,

464
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:36,254
attempted to silence witnesses,

465
00:26:36,934 --> 00:26:38,373
slaughtered your comrades,

466
00:26:38,494 --> 00:26:39,613
and betrayed the Wei!

467
00:26:40,174 --> 00:26:41,373
How heinous!

468
00:26:41,494 --> 00:26:42,454
Unforgivable!

469
00:26:43,494 --> 00:26:44,974
Now we have witnesses and evidence!

470
00:26:45,254 --> 00:26:46,613
How dare you still deny it?

471
00:26:56,093 --> 00:26:58,654
This matter isn't concluded yet.

472
00:26:59,773 --> 00:27:02,813
Your Majesty shouldn't
convict General He

473
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:04,573
hastily.

474
00:27:06,053 --> 00:27:07,293
Marquis Wu'an.

475
00:27:07,734 --> 00:27:10,174
How dare you draw sword
before the Emperor?

476
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:12,373
This is great disrespect!

477
00:27:13,254 --> 00:27:13,894
What?

478
00:27:19,174 --> 00:27:21,254
Chancellor Xu, did you forget

479
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:23,533
that those letters

480
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,133
also implicate you?

481
00:27:35,014 --> 00:27:36,934
Your Majesty.

482
00:27:38,014 --> 00:27:39,613
He Rufei committed countless crimes,

483
00:27:39,974 --> 00:27:40,533
but he's been

484
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,053
manipulated by Xu Jingfu.

485
00:27:42,773 --> 00:27:44,174
Xu Jingfu is the true

486
00:27:44,214 --> 00:27:45,133
mastermind

487
00:27:45,654 --> 00:27:47,014
who's making trouble

488
00:27:47,573 --> 00:27:49,613
and betraying the Wei!

489
00:27:53,734 --> 00:27:55,174
- Nonsense!
- Nonsense!

490
00:27:55,734 --> 00:27:56,494
Exactly.

491
00:27:57,254 --> 00:27:57,974
Back in Mingshui,

492
00:27:59,214 --> 00:28:00,694
you killed 30,000 Xiao Army soldiers

493
00:28:01,454 --> 00:28:03,214
to eliminate political rivals.

494
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:04,694
Back in Yezhou,

495
00:28:05,654 --> 00:28:06,494
you used someone

496
00:28:06,494 --> 00:28:07,934
to kill Sun Xiangfu

497
00:28:08,293 --> 00:28:09,813
to hide your embezzlement.

498
00:28:10,254 --> 00:28:10,894
Back in Jiyang,

499
00:28:11,254 --> 00:28:12,894
you colluded with Wutuo,

500
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:14,613
leading us to nearly lose Jiyang.

501
00:28:15,773 --> 00:28:17,573
In Huayuan and Rundu,

502
00:28:18,853 --> 00:28:20,373
you let He Rufei slaughter

503
00:28:20,654 --> 00:28:21,934
the seven generals,

504
00:28:22,214 --> 00:28:23,573
causing Rundu's siege.

505
00:28:23,894 --> 00:28:25,655
And you secretly
negotiated peace with Wutuo.

506
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:27,533
Everything you've done

507
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:30,174
serves only your personal gain.

508
00:28:35,573 --> 00:28:37,053
He corrupts the court,

509
00:28:37,533 --> 00:28:38,613
threatens the peace,

510
00:28:39,053 --> 00:28:40,293
and damages the people!

511
00:28:41,414 --> 00:28:43,694
His guilt is heinous!

512
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:51,014
He Yan.

513
00:28:52,214 --> 00:28:53,813
You said Chancellor Xu was behind this.

514
00:28:53,974 --> 00:28:54,773
Where's your proof?

515
00:29:09,254 --> 00:29:10,654
He Yan speaks the truth.

516
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:12,333
I am the witness!

517
00:29:26,373 --> 00:29:27,014
I have

518
00:29:27,373 --> 00:29:28,974
long been Chancellor Xu's disciple,

519
00:29:29,293 --> 00:29:31,093
and always respected him.

520
00:29:31,494 --> 00:29:32,293
But over time,

521
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:34,293
I realized he

522
00:29:36,254 --> 00:29:37,333
wasn't a virtuous minister

523
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,333
I believed.

524
00:29:44,974 --> 00:29:46,694
But he has shown me great kindness.

525
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:48,734
I struggled for a long time,

526
00:29:49,533 --> 00:29:51,694
yet I couldn't watch him
keep making mistakes.

527
00:29:52,894 --> 00:29:53,694
So yesterday,

528
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,694
I caught the Wutuo spy

529
00:29:55,734 --> 00:29:57,613
who's disguised
as Ganming Pavilion's owner.

530
00:29:58,414 --> 00:29:59,694
After the interrogation,

531
00:30:00,454 --> 00:30:01,254
he gave me

532
00:30:01,813 --> 00:30:02,533
a letter

533
00:30:03,254 --> 00:30:04,494
from Chancellor Xu

534
00:30:04,533 --> 00:30:05,853
to Wutuo envoy, Maningbu.

535
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:13,934
He promises Maningbu

536
00:30:14,654 --> 00:30:16,934
to promote
the trade market establishment.

537
00:30:22,214 --> 00:30:22,773
Get it to me.

538
00:30:23,093 --> 00:30:23,654
Yes.

539
00:30:36,848 --> 00:30:38,910
(To Maningbu)

540
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:52,738
(Trade Market Cooperation, Xu Jingfu)

541
00:31:08,454 --> 00:31:09,093
Now,

542
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:10,853
I've taken that Wutuo spy

543
00:31:11,093 --> 00:31:12,333
outside the hall.

544
00:31:14,934 --> 00:31:16,573
He can confront against

545
00:31:16,934 --> 00:31:17,773
Envoy Maningbu.

546
00:31:19,613 --> 00:31:20,133
Bring him.

547
00:31:20,293 --> 00:31:21,573
No need.

548
00:31:23,373 --> 00:31:24,773
You dare defy the imperial decree?

549
00:31:30,254 --> 00:31:32,853
You have aged.

550
00:31:33,414 --> 00:31:34,053
- He...
- What...

551
00:31:34,214 --> 00:31:35,174
What does he want?

552
00:31:35,734 --> 00:31:37,414
You're deceived by traitors,

553
00:31:38,894 --> 00:31:41,014
believing slanders,

554
00:31:41,573 --> 00:31:42,813
wronging loyal ministers!

555
00:31:45,573 --> 00:31:49,573
This grieves me deeply.

556
00:31:52,894 --> 00:31:53,533
As

557
00:31:55,254 --> 00:31:57,573
the Chancellor of Wei,

558
00:31:57,734 --> 00:31:59,414
I bear the duty to purge the villains

559
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:01,894
and eliminate treacherous officials!

560
00:32:03,853 --> 00:32:04,494
Guards!

561
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,974
Fuyue Army, heed my command!

562
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:08,053
Purge the villains!

563
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:27,494
- He's committing treason!
- He's committing treason!

564
00:32:36,093 --> 00:32:37,053
Xu Jingfu!

565
00:32:37,654 --> 00:32:39,214
How dare you commit treason!

566
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:49,813
Your Majesty,

567
00:32:50,373 --> 00:32:51,454
I've done

568
00:32:51,894 --> 00:32:54,133
all those things.

569
00:32:54,654 --> 00:32:56,813
You trust villains and alienated

570
00:32:56,853 --> 00:32:58,254
worthy ministers like me,

571
00:32:58,494 --> 00:33:00,654
failing to be a wise emperor.

572
00:33:01,293 --> 00:33:04,734
Naturally, I must step forward

573
00:33:04,934 --> 00:33:07,174
to uphold justice!

574
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:10,813
You treacherous rebel!

575
00:33:12,053 --> 00:33:14,174
How dare you say such words

576
00:33:15,254 --> 00:33:17,454
and plot to usurp the throne!

577
00:33:18,214 --> 00:33:19,014
Your Majesty,

578
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:21,533
don't get me wrong.

579
00:33:22,773 --> 00:33:25,773
I've been loyal to the nation.

580
00:33:25,894 --> 00:33:26,813
Once you

581
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:28,934
issue a penitential edict

582
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:30,254
and abdicates,

583
00:33:30,454 --> 00:33:31,133
I shall

584
00:33:31,454 --> 00:33:34,053
enthrone the young prince,

585
00:33:34,494 --> 00:33:36,214
purge the court,

586
00:33:36,494 --> 00:33:38,093
and restore the governance!

587
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:47,853
Fuyue Army, heed my command!

588
00:33:48,613 --> 00:33:49,974
Purge the villains!

589
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,533
Fuyue Army, heed my command!

590
00:34:01,214 --> 00:34:02,454
Purge the villains!

591
00:34:11,053 --> 00:34:12,894
Fuyue Army, heed my command!

592
00:34:13,494 --> 00:34:14,733
Purge the villains!

593
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:23,733
You...

594
00:34:23,774 --> 00:34:24,374
His Majesty has

595
00:34:24,374 --> 00:34:26,133
asked the Nine Banners Battalion
to stand by

596
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:27,454
to subdue the rebels!

597
00:34:27,934 --> 00:34:29,533
Nine Banners Battalion, heed my command!

598
00:34:30,053 --> 00:34:31,053
Capture the traitors!

599
00:34:31,334 --> 00:34:31,934
Yes!

600
00:34:32,014 --> 00:34:32,573
Yes!

601
00:34:43,894 --> 00:34:45,294
Nine Banners Battalion?

602
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:46,934
Why are they here?

603
00:34:47,414 --> 00:34:48,173
Useless!

604
00:34:52,374 --> 00:34:53,173
The rebels

605
00:34:53,894 --> 00:34:55,613
have been suppressed.

606
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:00,774
He Rufei.

607
00:35:01,494 --> 00:35:02,573
Most Fuyue Army soldiers

608
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:04,294
fought alongside me

609
00:35:04,294 --> 00:35:05,814
through life and death.

610
00:35:06,573 --> 00:35:07,374
He Rufei.

611
00:35:08,533 --> 00:35:09,414
How could they

612
00:35:09,494 --> 00:35:11,213
obey an impostor like you?

613
00:35:25,814 --> 00:35:27,733
Great!

614
00:35:28,774 --> 00:35:30,133
So Your Majesty

615
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:33,494
collaborated with Commander Xiao

616
00:35:33,573 --> 00:35:35,053
in this deception!

617
00:35:38,774 --> 00:35:40,494
Well played!

618
00:35:41,133 --> 00:35:42,814
You have schemed thoroughly,

619
00:35:43,093 --> 00:35:45,294
but overlooked your own arrogance.

620
00:35:52,173 --> 00:35:52,733
Master,

621
00:35:53,374 --> 00:35:54,733
you often taught me

622
00:35:55,294 --> 00:35:56,374
to serve the emperor

623
00:35:57,374 --> 00:35:58,294
and help the people.

624
00:35:59,213 --> 00:36:00,693
Yet what you've done

625
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:02,374
threatens

626
00:36:02,414 --> 00:36:03,613
the nation

627
00:36:03,613 --> 00:36:04,974
and damages the people.

628
00:36:11,093 --> 00:36:12,334
I beg you,

629
00:36:14,374 --> 00:36:16,093
please stop.

630
00:36:21,653 --> 00:36:22,533
Zilan,

631
00:36:23,294 --> 00:36:25,454
I've treated you well.

632
00:36:26,014 --> 00:36:27,733
How dare you join forces with them

633
00:36:27,733 --> 00:36:29,253
to conspire against me!

634
00:36:29,693 --> 00:36:30,733
What benefits

635
00:36:30,733 --> 00:36:33,133
did they promise you

636
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,974
to make you

637
00:36:35,253 --> 00:36:36,454
act so ungratefully

638
00:36:36,533 --> 00:36:37,894
regardless my kindness to you?

639
00:36:43,613 --> 00:36:45,374
You ingrate!

640
00:36:51,294 --> 00:36:52,733
You preach benevolence,

641
00:36:54,014 --> 00:36:54,774
but in my view,

642
00:36:55,533 --> 00:36:57,494
you're just exploiting favors for gain.

643
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,894
National interests
outweigh personal favors.

644
00:37:01,894 --> 00:37:03,173
As the Chancellor,

645
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:04,573
don't you know

646
00:37:04,613 --> 00:37:05,494
such a basic idea?

647
00:37:06,653 --> 00:37:07,454
Master,

648
00:37:10,454 --> 00:37:11,294
just surrender.

649
00:37:17,334 --> 00:37:18,613
Am I wrong?

650
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,014
Everything I've done

651
00:37:24,294 --> 00:37:25,854
was for the Wei's

652
00:37:25,854 --> 00:37:27,653
future!

653
00:37:29,093 --> 00:37:30,693
You military officials

654
00:37:30,934 --> 00:37:32,974
only resort to wars.

655
00:37:33,894 --> 00:37:35,653
Aren't the soldiers who die in battle

656
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:38,093
the Wei's citizens?

657
00:37:39,733 --> 00:37:42,253
Aren't the vast military funds

658
00:37:42,374 --> 00:37:43,454
spent year after year

659
00:37:43,454 --> 00:37:45,814
the hard-earned money of Wei's people?

660
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:52,774
You military officials

661
00:37:52,894 --> 00:37:54,253
chase military glory,

662
00:37:54,253 --> 00:37:55,774
while ignoring the people's suffering!

663
00:37:56,253 --> 00:37:59,014
You're the true criminals of Wei!

664
00:37:59,334 --> 00:37:59,934
Nonsense!

665
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,494
You were the one who started the war!

666
00:38:03,693 --> 00:38:05,774
Our army surged
with unstoppable momentum

667
00:38:06,173 --> 00:38:07,374
and crushed the Wutuo forces.

668
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:09,253
If we won

669
00:38:10,014 --> 00:38:11,613
the Mingshui Battle,

670
00:38:12,213 --> 00:38:13,814
the war would be concluded

671
00:38:14,613 --> 00:38:16,093
and peace would come.

672
00:38:17,774 --> 00:38:19,494
But you're blinded by personal ambition.

673
00:38:20,213 --> 00:38:21,334
To eliminate dissidents,

674
00:38:21,613 --> 00:38:22,894
you conspired with enemies,

675
00:38:23,653 --> 00:38:25,053
sacrificing thousands

676
00:38:25,173 --> 00:38:26,573
of Xiao Army soldiers!

677
00:38:28,334 --> 00:38:29,613
Yet you didn't repent.

678
00:38:31,334 --> 00:38:32,774
To cover your crimes,

679
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:36,053
you aided Wutuo, our enemy,

680
00:38:37,934 --> 00:38:39,133
and exposed the Wei's people

681
00:38:39,213 --> 00:38:40,774
to endless warfare!

682
00:38:41,533 --> 00:38:42,494
Xu Jingfu.

683
00:38:42,774 --> 00:38:43,854
You said what you've done

684
00:38:43,894 --> 00:38:45,533
was for the Wei's future,

685
00:38:46,774 --> 00:38:48,014
yet what you've done

686
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:49,653
serves only your personal gains.

687
00:38:56,173 --> 00:38:56,934
Xiao Jue.

688
00:38:57,573 --> 00:38:59,294
Don't you understand?

689
00:38:59,733 --> 00:39:02,133
Military officials secure,
while civil officials govern.

690
00:39:02,454 --> 00:39:03,934
What strategies

691
00:39:04,053 --> 00:39:05,053
do you military officials

692
00:39:05,213 --> 00:39:07,414
have, except for warfare?

693
00:39:07,774 --> 00:39:09,494
Everything I've done

694
00:39:09,494 --> 00:39:11,253
was for the Wei!

695
00:39:16,733 --> 00:39:17,414
Your Majesty,

696
00:39:18,093 --> 00:39:20,533
my loyalty is

697
00:39:21,294 --> 00:39:23,934
beyond question!

698
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:30,934
If everyone had

699
00:39:31,014 --> 00:39:32,414
such loyalty as yours,

700
00:39:32,653 --> 00:39:33,894
then the nation

701
00:39:35,213 --> 00:39:36,454
would be doomed.

702
00:39:39,693 --> 00:39:40,294
Yan He.

703
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:41,334
Li Kuang.

704
00:39:42,334 --> 00:39:42,814
Yes!

705
00:39:43,894 --> 00:39:45,974
Take Xu Jingfu and He Rufei

706
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,133
into custody.

707
00:39:47,653 --> 00:39:49,133
After the joint trial,

708
00:39:49,613 --> 00:39:50,533
execute them.

709
00:39:51,173 --> 00:39:51,854
Yes!

710
00:39:58,173 --> 00:40:00,014
I'll walk myself.

711
00:40:35,653 --> 00:40:36,454
Mr. Xiao.

712
00:40:36,814 --> 00:40:37,733
How should we

713
00:40:38,414 --> 00:40:39,894
deal with

714
00:40:40,173 --> 00:40:41,213
this Envoy Maningbu?

715
00:40:46,213 --> 00:40:46,774
Your Majesty,

716
00:40:47,374 --> 00:40:49,213
since Maningbu represents Wutuo

717
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,573
as the envoy,

718
00:40:50,974 --> 00:40:51,894
we should

719
00:40:52,334 --> 00:40:53,894
detain him at the embassy,

720
00:40:54,774 --> 00:40:56,093
and write to the King of Wutuo,

721
00:40:56,613 --> 00:40:57,573
stating his crimes.

722
00:40:58,014 --> 00:40:59,173
His disposition rests solely

723
00:40:59,774 --> 00:41:01,414
on the King of Wutuo's response.

724
00:41:04,093 --> 00:41:04,774
Move!

725
00:41:11,173 --> 00:41:12,014
Marquis Wu'an.

726
00:41:13,294 --> 00:41:15,294
Technically, you're from the He family.

727
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:16,653
The He family

728
00:41:17,253 --> 00:41:18,173
disguised a daughter,

729
00:41:18,253 --> 00:41:19,253
deceiving the Emperor.

730
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:20,814
