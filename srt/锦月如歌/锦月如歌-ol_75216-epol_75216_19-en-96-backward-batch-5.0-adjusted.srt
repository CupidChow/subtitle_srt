=Episode 19=

23
00:01:47,348 --> 00:01:47,907
Good morning.

24
00:01:48,068 --> 00:01:48,667
Commander Xiao.

25
00:01:48,988 --> 00:01:49,588
Miss He.

26
00:01:49,907 --> 00:01:51,148
Let's have breakfast together.

27
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:53,664
Please.

28
00:01:57,988 --> 00:01:58,827
Actually,

29
00:01:58,948 --> 00:01:59,948
I've known for a while

30
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:01,667
you're not my elder brother's son.

31
00:02:05,948 --> 00:02:07,028
Your act

32
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:08,147
was quite convincing.

33
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,667
Since Her Highness knew

34
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:10,867
you came to Jiyang

35
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:12,028
and yet did nothing,

36
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:13,267
she must have her plans.

37
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:14,387
In that case,

38
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,508
I had to play the fool.

39
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:20,028
You're a master of disguise.

40
00:02:20,228 --> 00:02:20,948
I'm impressed.

41
00:02:21,547 --> 00:02:23,188
To become Princess Mengji's right hand,

42
00:02:23,707 --> 00:02:24,308
you must be

43
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:26,147
exceptionally clever.

44
00:02:27,387 --> 00:02:29,267
Not as astute as you.

45
00:02:30,987 --> 00:02:32,308
Let's have breakfast together.

46
00:02:35,827 --> 00:02:36,416
Please.

47
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:46,387
Mr. Chu.

48
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:49,987
Mr. He, good morning.

49
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:50,827
Good morning.

50
00:02:51,827 --> 00:02:53,908
But now I should call you Miss He.

51
00:02:55,547 --> 00:02:56,628
You're still mistaken.

52
00:02:57,387 --> 00:02:58,028
Currently,

53
00:02:59,028 --> 00:03:00,308
you should call her Mrs. Qiao.

54
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:07,628
We have a visit to make, right?

55
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:08,547
Let's go.

56
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:10,147
Go.

57
00:03:10,908 --> 00:03:11,707
Don't miss the time.

58
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:16,480
Mr. Chu.

59
00:03:16,628 --> 00:03:17,468
I'll take my leave.

60
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:45,228
Speak your mind.

61
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:48,827
How did you know

62
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:50,628
I was visiting an elder?

63
00:03:51,468 --> 00:03:53,068
You dressed formally this morning,

64
00:03:53,748 --> 00:03:55,147
obviously to meet someone.

65
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:56,547
In all of Jiyang,

66
00:03:57,147 --> 00:03:58,748
the only one worthy of such formality

67
00:03:59,267 --> 00:04:00,228
would be your master.

68
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:02,308
My master once told me

69
00:04:02,628 --> 00:04:03,587
that if needed,

70
00:04:03,748 --> 00:04:04,948
I could find him in Jiyang.

71
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:06,427
I assumed

72
00:04:06,587 --> 00:04:07,788
he was merely enjoying nature

73
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:08,788
but never imagined

74
00:04:09,068 --> 00:04:10,348
there was a hidden story.

75
00:04:16,308 --> 00:04:16,988
What story?

76
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:19,267
If it's hidden,

77
00:04:19,587 --> 00:04:20,907
it can't be revealed.

78
00:04:21,508 --> 00:04:22,267
Commander,

79
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:24,108
please don't press me.

80
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:26,068
Fine.

81
00:04:26,868 --> 00:04:27,868
I don't care to know.

82
00:04:29,308 --> 00:04:29,948
Thank you.

83
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:45,088
Thank you.

84
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:47,668
Thank you, Master.

85
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:49,948
Master Yunlin.

86
00:04:51,027 --> 00:04:52,068
When did you arrive here?

87
00:04:56,147 --> 00:04:57,587
Around each Water God Festival,

88
00:04:57,988 --> 00:04:59,787
I return to Jiyang City.

89
00:05:00,428 --> 00:05:01,267
This time,

90
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,027
I discovered Wutuo spies

91
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,027
disguised as civilians.

92
00:05:05,508 --> 00:05:06,147
So,

93
00:05:06,387 --> 00:05:07,587
I tracked them secretly

94
00:05:08,347 --> 00:05:08,868
and indeed,

95
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:10,467
these Wutuo spies

96
00:05:10,988 --> 00:05:12,948
used the festival crowds

97
00:05:13,267 --> 00:05:14,668
to kidnap the young princess

98
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,508
to blackmail Princess Mengji.

99
00:05:17,508 --> 00:05:18,628
The kidnapping

100
00:05:19,548 --> 00:05:20,467
is just the first step.

101
00:05:21,628 --> 00:05:22,428
Now, Wutuo agents

102
00:05:22,428 --> 00:05:23,988
move freely through Jiyang,

103
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:26,068
like water eroding stone.

104
00:05:26,387 --> 00:05:27,467
This was long planned.

105
00:05:28,188 --> 00:05:28,868
Her Highness

106
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:29,748
dislikes

107
00:05:29,827 --> 00:05:30,707
our interference

108
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:32,227
but has enhanced

109
00:05:32,227 --> 00:05:33,227
security checks.

110
00:05:33,787 --> 00:05:35,108
Let's hope it helps.

111
00:05:36,188 --> 00:05:38,587
It feels like a storm
is brewing in Jiyang City.

112
00:05:39,227 --> 00:05:40,548
Something major approaches.

113
00:05:45,628 --> 00:05:46,272
You continue.

114
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:48,428
I need fresh air.

115
00:05:55,227 --> 00:05:56,628
Ask what you wish.

116
00:06:00,587 --> 00:06:01,308
Master.

117
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:03,467
Did you stay in Jiyang

118
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:04,628
for Princess Mengji?

119
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:07,748
Or is there another reason?

120
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:09,907
Even if she weren't Princess Mengji,

121
00:06:10,868 --> 00:06:12,508
I won't stand idly by

122
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:13,587
and see the people

123
00:06:13,988 --> 00:06:15,508
in Jiyang suffer.

124
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:17,467
Isn't it the same between you

125
00:06:17,707 --> 00:06:18,668
and General Fengyun?

126
00:06:22,587 --> 00:06:23,668
You're right.

127
00:06:24,188 --> 00:06:25,147
I was small-minded.

128
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:27,827
But Master,

129
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:29,188
you...

130
00:06:29,988 --> 00:06:31,548
Do you truly have no wish to see

131
00:06:31,988 --> 00:06:33,147
Princess Mengji again?

132
00:06:36,707 --> 00:06:38,147
You have much work to attend to.

133
00:06:38,587 --> 00:06:39,628
I won't keep you longer.

134
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:53,827
Your master

135
00:06:54,387 --> 00:06:55,668
seems burdened.

136
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:57,467
Even you noticed.

137
00:07:19,668 --> 00:07:20,508
I don't know

138
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:21,628
Master Yunlin well,

139
00:07:22,628 --> 00:07:23,168
but

140
00:07:24,387 --> 00:07:26,628
this melody clearly reveals deep sorrow.

141
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:31,707
You truly are a master of music.

142
00:07:32,707 --> 00:07:34,548
People may conceal truths,

143
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:37,988
but instruments never lie.

144
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:44,347
If I recall correctly,

145
00:07:44,988 --> 00:07:46,108
Princess Mengji also played

146
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:47,027
this melody before?

147
00:07:51,548 --> 00:07:53,108
They truly share a profound connection.

148
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:04,064
(Peaceful Land)

149
00:08:13,787 --> 00:08:14,368
Commander,

150
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:15,948
Mr. Cui needs you

151
00:08:16,227 --> 00:08:17,068
for urgent matters.

152
00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:19,948
I'll take my leave.

153
00:08:20,347 --> 00:08:20,928
And you?

154
00:08:21,027 --> 00:08:21,907
You should return.

155
00:08:22,188 --> 00:08:23,147
I'll walk around

156
00:08:23,387 --> 00:08:24,188
and secretly inspect

157
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:25,068
the defenses.

158
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:32,347
(South Gate)

159
00:08:32,347 --> 00:08:33,057
Next.

160
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,568
Go.

161
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:38,720
Next.

162
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:42,388
Next.

163
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,388
Next.

164
00:08:48,707 --> 00:08:49,280
Go.

165
00:08:52,587 --> 00:08:53,280
Go.

166
00:08:55,347 --> 00:08:55,968
Go.

167
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,587
Princess Mengji is decisive.

168
00:08:58,867 --> 00:08:59,827
A masterful defender.

169
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:03,136
Next.

170
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:12,068
I truly hope Jiyang City

171
00:09:12,388 --> 00:09:13,788
can maintain this peace

172
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:14,827
and harmony forever.

173
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:45,227
Mr. Chu?

174
00:09:45,428 --> 00:09:46,188
Why is it you?

175
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:48,467
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:49,148 --> 00:09:49,827
I startled you?

177
00:09:50,428 --> 00:09:51,008
It's nothing.

178
00:09:51,347 --> 00:09:52,467
These are turbulent times.

179
00:09:52,668 --> 00:09:53,908
Caution is only natural.

180
00:09:54,148 --> 00:09:55,227
Please don't take offense.

181
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:57,428
Actually,

182
00:09:57,827 --> 00:09:58,948
I want to apologize to you.

183
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:00,347
Apologize?

184
00:10:01,148 --> 00:10:01,747
Why?

185
00:10:02,428 --> 00:10:04,747
Last time, it was I who invited you

186
00:10:04,788 --> 00:10:06,308
to admire the moon over Mount Baiyue.

187
00:10:06,747 --> 00:10:07,788
But urgent matters arose,

188
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:08,747
and I left.

189
00:10:10,148 --> 00:10:11,028
Nothing.

190
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:12,308
Don't take it seriously.

191
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:14,148
Moreover,

192
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:16,188
I did gain something else that night.

193
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:21,948
You hold no grudge

194
00:10:22,308 --> 00:10:23,428
due to your magnanimity.

195
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:24,987
I cannot pretend

196
00:10:25,028 --> 00:10:25,788
it never happened.

197
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:27,707
I must apologize.

198
00:10:28,507 --> 00:10:29,056
By the way,

199
00:10:29,908 --> 00:10:31,268
let me give you a gift, Miss He.

200
00:10:31,827 --> 00:10:32,480
What?

201
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:35,188
Last time we met,

202
00:10:35,747 --> 00:10:36,627
I noticed

203
00:10:36,788 --> 00:10:37,827
you wore a purple whip

204
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:38,707
at your waist.

205
00:10:39,227 --> 00:10:39,987
By chance,

206
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:40,987
I obtained this tassel.

207
00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:43,467
I think it suits you perfectly.

208
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:44,548
Try it on.

209
00:10:44,747 --> 00:10:45,867
See if it's better.

210
00:10:49,507 --> 00:10:50,068
Mr. Chu,

211
00:10:50,548 --> 00:10:51,388
I can't accept it.

212
00:10:51,627 --> 00:10:52,347
Forget it.

213
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:53,467
Besides,

214
00:10:53,668 --> 00:10:54,747
this tassel appears

215
00:10:54,908 --> 00:10:55,827
quite valuable.

216
00:10:57,148 --> 00:10:58,107
You call me Mr. Chu.

217
00:10:58,268 --> 00:10:59,268
We're friends.

218
00:10:59,428 --> 00:11:00,107
Between friends,

219
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:01,507
exchanging gifts is natural.

220
00:11:01,587 --> 00:11:02,268
Besides,

221
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:03,908
this tassel isn't costly,

222
00:11:04,107 --> 00:11:05,227
so feel no obligation.

223
00:11:07,424 --> 00:11:08,028
Okay.

224
00:11:08,028 --> 00:11:08,788
I'll accept it.

225
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:11,107
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

226
00:11:21,188 --> 00:11:21,908
Perfect match.

227
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,188
In return,

228
00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:27,107
I should give you something, Mr. Chu.

229
00:11:33,987 --> 00:11:35,028
- Sir.
- Miss.

230
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,388
Which is the priciest one

231
00:11:36,388 --> 00:11:36,908
here?

232
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:37,788
The floral basket.

233
00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:38,948
Would you like one?

234
00:11:39,188 --> 00:11:40,068
Yes, give me one.

235
00:11:40,107 --> 00:11:40,707
Alright.

236
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:43,308
May I draw it myself?

237
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:44,347
Certainly.

238
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:45,148
Here you go.

239
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:44,668
Done.

240
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:45,548
How's this?

241
00:12:45,827 --> 00:12:46,668
Do you like it?

242
00:12:51,627 --> 00:12:52,268
Zilan

243
00:12:52,347 --> 00:12:53,507
means fragrant orchid.

244
00:12:53,827 --> 00:12:54,948
The person who named you

245
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:55,908
loved you certainly.

246
00:12:56,268 --> 00:12:58,467
They surely wished you noble virtues

247
00:12:58,587 --> 00:12:59,388
and a good future,

248
00:12:59,668 --> 00:13:00,908
so you got this elegant name.

249
00:13:01,268 --> 00:13:01,824
This is

250
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:03,028
my reciprocal gift.

251
00:13:03,308 --> 00:13:03,908
Mr. Chu,

252
00:13:03,987 --> 00:13:05,428
don't mock my clumsy handwriting.

253
00:13:06,867 --> 00:13:07,668
How could I?

254
00:13:07,908 --> 00:13:08,707
I'm deeply honored.

255
00:13:11,548 --> 00:13:12,107
Burn him!

256
00:13:12,227 --> 00:13:13,388
- Burn him!
- Burn him!

257
00:13:23,308 --> 00:13:23,827
Mr. Chu.

258
00:13:25,908 --> 00:13:26,467
Mr. Chu.

259
00:13:27,867 --> 00:13:28,668
It's okay.

260
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:30,107
Are you

261
00:13:30,867 --> 00:13:31,908
afraid of fire?

262
00:13:37,507 --> 00:13:38,268
Thank goodness

263
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:39,587
this isn't ruined.

264
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:50,272
(Mengji Mansion)

265
00:13:53,428 --> 00:13:54,467
Jiyang's defenses

266
00:13:54,788 --> 00:13:55,747
remain well-fortified.

267
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:58,507
Let's hope so.

268
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:02,987
Commander.

269
00:14:09,788 --> 00:14:10,432
Commander.

270
00:14:10,627 --> 00:14:11,587
Where are you going?

271
00:14:12,707 --> 00:14:13,308
Just walking.

272
00:14:14,148 --> 00:14:14,987
Then I'll join you.

273
00:14:20,548 --> 00:14:22,188
This is a gift from Mr. Chu.

274
00:14:25,507 --> 00:14:26,908
Miss He also gave me a gift.

275
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:28,908
I like it very much.

276
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:37,707
She once sent me osmanthus candies,

277
00:14:38,507 --> 00:14:39,347
a whole handful,

278
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:42,188
more than I could eat.

279
00:14:45,388 --> 00:14:47,467
The characters "Zilan"
on this sugar painting

280
00:14:48,227 --> 00:14:50,148
were written by Miss He herself.

281
00:14:55,587 --> 00:14:56,467
This food is fragile.

282
00:14:57,268 --> 00:14:58,788
You should keep it carefully

283
00:14:59,428 --> 00:15:00,028
in case you

284
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:01,867
end up with nothing.

285
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,068
Thank you for the advice.

286
00:15:05,347 --> 00:15:06,867
I'll preserve it with utmost care.

287
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:14,068
If you both enjoy sweets so much,

288
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:15,747
I'll buy more in the future.

289
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:17,152
Commander.

290
00:15:20,908 --> 00:15:21,987
Several crucial granaries

291
00:15:22,028 --> 00:15:22,668
are ablaze.

292
00:15:22,987 --> 00:15:23,788
Very fiercely.

293
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:25,107
It's the Wutuo's doing.

294
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,268
Assist Mr. Cui

295
00:15:27,347 --> 00:15:27,987
in it.

296
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:29,440
Yes.

297
00:15:31,587 --> 00:15:32,388
Let's discuss it

298
00:15:32,668 --> 00:15:33,507
with Princess Mengji.

299
00:15:34,428 --> 00:15:34,976
Agreed.

300
00:15:44,188 --> 00:15:46,908
Fire! The granary's on fire!

301
00:15:51,308 --> 00:15:52,308
It's the Wutuo people.

302
00:15:53,548 --> 00:15:54,747
They've made their move.

303
00:16:06,268 --> 00:16:07,587
Quite the spectacle.

304
00:16:08,227 --> 00:16:09,308
Those Wutuo people

305
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:10,908
grow more audacious by the day.

306
00:16:11,707 --> 00:16:12,867
Doesn't this situation feel

307
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:13,788
all too familiar?

308
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:15,507
Mingshui

309
00:16:15,948 --> 00:16:16,587
and Que City

310
00:16:16,788 --> 00:16:18,068
both witnessed similar things.

311
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:19,707
The Wutuo people

312
00:16:19,827 --> 00:16:21,148
breached the defenses easily

313
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,268
and launched attacks.

314
00:16:23,068 --> 00:16:24,747
This time, Chancellor Xu aided them.

315
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:27,188
As for the previous two...

316
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,107
After this,

317
00:16:32,428 --> 00:16:34,068
Xiao Jue won't let this slide.

318
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:35,188
Go take a look.

319
00:17:19,628 --> 00:17:20,828
Skip the formalities.

320
00:17:21,348 --> 00:17:22,148
You've come.

321
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:23,467
Lou,

322
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:25,307
they're your life savers.

323
00:17:25,707 --> 00:17:26,467
Have you forgotten

324
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:27,267
your manners?

325
00:17:27,428 --> 00:17:28,628
How could you act like this?

326
00:17:31,908 --> 00:17:32,547
Commander Xiao.

327
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:34,267
I was just about to see you.

328
00:17:34,908 --> 00:17:35,628
As you observed,

329
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:37,628
Wutuo is watching hungrily.

330
00:17:38,027 --> 00:17:39,348
The situation in Jiyang City

331
00:17:39,588 --> 00:17:41,588
grows more dire by the day.

332
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:43,628
Though I've dispatched troops

333
00:17:43,747 --> 00:17:45,027
and increased security,

334
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:46,188
the Wutuo people

335
00:17:46,628 --> 00:17:47,628
are moving faster.

336
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:48,868
How many men

337
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:50,348
are stationed here?

338
00:17:51,547 --> 00:17:52,227
Under 20,000.

339
00:17:54,668 --> 00:17:55,348
We've captured

340
00:17:55,348 --> 00:17:56,828
some Wutuo infiltrators,

341
00:17:57,507 --> 00:17:59,067
but it won't turn the tide.

342
00:17:59,908 --> 00:18:01,787
Wutuo has already launched its attack.

343
00:18:02,188 --> 00:18:03,787
This will be a bitter struggle.

344
00:18:05,227 --> 00:18:06,948
Though Jiyang lacks manpower,

345
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:08,307
we'll never retreat.

346
00:18:08,948 --> 00:18:10,188
I'll hold my position here

347
00:18:10,987 --> 00:18:11,948
and stand with Jiyang

348
00:18:12,707 --> 00:18:13,628
to the last breath.

349
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:17,027
I'd like

350
00:18:17,948 --> 00:18:19,428
to offer my assistance.

351
00:18:35,307 --> 00:18:36,787
Leaving your post at Yezhou

352
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:38,227
is a breach of military law.

353
00:18:38,747 --> 00:18:39,787
Commanding troops now

354
00:18:40,388 --> 00:18:41,067
would bring

355
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:42,908
graver consequences.

356
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:44,707
Do you truly

357
00:18:45,148 --> 00:18:46,108
risk such repercussions

358
00:18:46,787 --> 00:18:48,307
for Jiyang's sake?

359
00:18:49,388 --> 00:18:50,588
As a Wei general,

360
00:18:51,188 --> 00:18:51,987
it's my duty

361
00:18:52,868 --> 00:18:53,787
to protect the people.

362
00:18:58,908 --> 00:19:01,108
I'll contribute my efforts, too.

363
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:04,288
Good.

364
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:06,027
From this moment,

365
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:07,987
all Jiyang troops

366
00:19:08,388 --> 00:19:09,787
will obey Commander Xiao's orders.

367
00:19:16,707 --> 00:19:17,908
Our people's safety

368
00:19:18,588 --> 00:19:19,908
rests in your hands, Commander.

369
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,388
I'll spare no effort

370
00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:25,227
to defend Jiyang to the last.

371
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:38,432
Your Highness,

372
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:40,628
the war looms imminent.

373
00:19:41,148 --> 00:19:41,787
Perhaps

374
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:42,828
the young princess

375
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:44,108
should be sent away.

376
00:19:45,027 --> 00:19:46,027
I'm staying here.

377
00:19:46,388 --> 00:19:47,467
I remain with Mother

378
00:19:47,908 --> 00:19:49,348
and our people

379
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,227
no matter what.

380
00:20:00,027 --> 00:20:00,547
So be it.

381
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:02,747
You'll stay by my side, Lou.

382
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:04,948
I'll keep you safe,

383
00:20:05,307 --> 00:20:06,348
whatever the cost.

384
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:30,908
(Self-Revealing Virtue)

385
00:20:30,908 --> 00:20:32,108
The troops here in Jiyang

386
00:20:32,668 --> 00:20:33,547
are far too few.

387
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,148
And they lack recent combat experience.

388
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:40,428
You show true leadership.

389
00:20:40,588 --> 00:20:41,507
Unflinching in crisis.

390
00:20:42,948 --> 00:20:43,868
Aren't you

391
00:20:44,348 --> 00:20:45,828
aspiring to be a female general?

392
00:20:47,388 --> 00:20:47,987
20,000 men.

393
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:49,388
Far better than that

394
00:20:49,507 --> 00:20:50,188
in Que City.

395
00:20:51,307 --> 00:20:52,267
Whether 20,000

396
00:20:52,388 --> 00:20:53,227
or 2,000,

397
00:20:53,828 --> 00:20:54,868
when enemies are outside,

398
00:20:55,348 --> 00:20:56,628
we fight to the death.

399
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:58,668
Prove those words true.

400
00:21:03,987 --> 00:21:04,747
These 20,000 men

401
00:21:05,707 --> 00:21:06,787
will follow your command.

402
00:21:09,307 --> 00:21:10,267
Wise choice, Commander.

403
00:21:11,027 --> 00:21:12,108
None could lead but me.

404
00:21:17,747 --> 00:21:18,336
Thrust.

405
00:21:19,148 --> 00:21:19,808
Stab.

406
00:21:20,736 --> 00:21:23,456
Down. Chop.

407
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:25,267
After years without combat,

408
00:21:25,588 --> 00:21:26,707
they look slack.

409
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:28,987
Such bold claims.

410
00:21:29,828 --> 00:21:30,987
You make our army

411
00:21:30,987 --> 00:21:32,188
sound like brittle clay.

412
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:34,067
Just a mere woman.

413
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:35,467
How can you teach us men

414
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:36,428
battle tactics?

415
00:21:36,987 --> 00:21:38,547
You're gambling

416
00:21:38,628 --> 00:21:39,227
with our lives.

417
00:21:41,108 --> 00:21:41,728
Well?

418
00:21:41,948 --> 00:21:43,108
Care to test me?

419
00:21:43,747 --> 00:21:44,707
Don't waste time.

420
00:21:46,027 --> 00:21:46,787
All ten of you

421
00:21:49,428 --> 00:21:50,747
attack her at once.

422
00:21:51,628 --> 00:21:53,307
You mock us?

423
00:21:53,828 --> 00:21:54,828
I would like to see

424
00:21:54,908 --> 00:21:56,547
how you'll face ten opponents alone.

425
00:21:57,388 --> 00:21:57,888
Commander.

426
00:21:58,547 --> 00:22:00,227
You honor me excessively.

427
00:22:04,828 --> 00:22:05,787
Do you know?

428
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:06,948
I hear

429
00:22:07,188 --> 00:22:09,588
Mrs. Qiao is challenging
the Jiyang army single-handedly

430
00:22:09,868 --> 00:22:12,027
at the training field.

431
00:22:14,188 --> 00:22:14,868
Is she crazy?

432
00:22:27,828 --> 00:22:28,868
Any more challengers?

433
00:22:29,027 --> 00:22:30,628
- Great!
- Great!

434
00:22:31,787 --> 00:22:32,747
- Great!
- Great!

435
00:22:32,828 --> 00:22:33,388
Now you see

436
00:22:33,388 --> 00:22:34,307
how formidable she is.

437
00:22:34,828 --> 00:22:36,307
Truly the best of Yezhou Garrison.

438
00:22:37,628 --> 00:22:38,267
This scene

439
00:22:38,467 --> 00:22:39,987
looks eerily familiar to me.

440
00:22:46,144 --> 00:22:46,720
Here.

441
00:22:49,787 --> 00:22:50,400
Thank you.

442
00:22:51,948 --> 00:22:53,267
- Amazing!
- Awesome!

443
00:22:53,588 --> 00:22:54,227
Yes.

444
00:22:57,348 --> 00:22:58,227
Incredible!

445
00:22:59,547 --> 00:23:00,828
Didn't I tell you the truth?

446
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:02,067
Women

447
00:23:02,828 --> 00:23:04,108
are never inferior to men.

448
00:23:04,828 --> 00:23:05,588
Through the ages,

449
00:23:06,027 --> 00:23:06,828
people have claimed

450
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,067
women belong at embroidery frames

451
00:23:09,067 --> 00:23:10,148
and housewifery.

452
00:23:10,628 --> 00:23:11,467
But must we women

453
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:13,348
be confined to domestic roles

454
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:14,707
or limited to needlework?

455
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,027
We can write and fight.

456
00:23:17,507 --> 00:23:18,908
We can write literary masterpieces.

457
00:23:19,467 --> 00:23:20,747
We can charge into battle

458
00:23:21,148 --> 00:23:21,987
and earn glory.

459
00:23:22,828 --> 00:23:24,388
We're not just waiting to be saved.

460
00:23:25,108 --> 00:23:26,307
We can save ourselves.

461
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:30,067
Of course

462
00:23:31,108 --> 00:23:32,307
I won't force you

463
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,267
to fight on battlefields.

464
00:23:35,307 --> 00:23:36,868
But beyond combat,

465
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:38,428
you can do other things.

466
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,588
Even the tiniest dust

467
00:23:41,067 --> 00:23:42,267
can fill mountains and seas.

468
00:23:42,948 --> 00:23:44,027
The faintest glow

469
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:45,747
can rival the sun and moon.

470
00:23:47,388 --> 00:23:48,707
I prided myself on noble birth

471
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:50,987
but remained trapped in stagnation.

472
00:23:51,707 --> 00:23:53,828
I can sell unwanted jewels

473
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,388
to buy

474
00:23:55,588 --> 00:23:56,948
weapons and provisions.

475
00:23:57,148 --> 00:24:00,668
- Me too!
- Me too!

476
00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:01,408
I'll donate.

477
00:24:03,547 --> 00:24:04,707
Those who are poor can learn

478
00:24:04,707 --> 00:24:05,507
medicine from us.

479
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:07,227
Countless soldiers will need care

480
00:24:07,227 --> 00:24:07,908
later.

481
00:24:08,507 --> 00:24:09,668
Rich or poor, all can learn.

482
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:17,152
Well?

483
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:18,388
Am I impressive?

484
00:24:19,227 --> 00:24:20,108
You know why I let you

485
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:20,908
lead them?

486
00:24:21,307 --> 00:24:21,828
Because

487
00:24:23,267 --> 00:24:24,588
I'm unquestionably capable.

488
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:31,267
Miss He is so skilled

489
00:24:31,307 --> 00:24:32,108
in martial arts.

490
00:24:32,948 --> 00:24:33,467
She

491
00:24:34,108 --> 00:24:35,307
always defies convention.

492
00:24:38,828 --> 00:24:39,348
Young Master,

493
00:24:39,868 --> 00:24:40,908
Princess Mengji began

494
00:24:40,908 --> 00:24:42,588
evacuating the civilians today.

495
00:24:43,428 --> 00:24:44,628
Shouldn't you join them?

496
00:24:45,227 --> 00:24:46,307
My goal is unfinished.

497
00:24:46,868 --> 00:24:47,787
How can I leave now?

498
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,307
But Jiyang is too dangerous.

499
00:24:49,987 --> 00:24:50,828
Only by staying

500
00:24:51,507 --> 00:24:52,227
can I uncover

501
00:24:52,388 --> 00:24:53,388
Master's true intentions.

502
00:24:54,388 --> 00:24:54,908
Yingxiang,

503
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:56,868
two paths lie before me.

504
00:24:57,267 --> 00:24:57,828
Either

505
00:24:59,188 --> 00:25:00,067
die in this city

506
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:02,027
or survive

507
00:25:02,227 --> 00:25:03,668
to confirm my suspicions.

508
00:25:04,507 --> 00:25:05,868
A life of complacency

509
00:25:05,987 --> 00:25:06,948
would be meaningless

510
00:25:07,428 --> 00:25:08,108
even if I return.

511
00:25:08,787 --> 00:25:09,408
Understand?

512
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:22,507
Keep up.

513
00:25:23,948 --> 00:25:25,027
Everyone, follow me.

514
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:25,760
Stay close.

515
00:25:32,027 --> 00:25:32,868
Jiyang has become

516
00:25:33,027 --> 00:25:34,108
half-deserted overnight.

517
00:25:35,188 --> 00:25:36,467
Shops stand shuttered.

518
00:25:38,987 --> 00:25:39,908
Only the able-bodied

519
00:25:40,067 --> 00:25:41,188
and those strong enough

520
00:25:41,388 --> 00:25:42,428
could flee.

521
00:25:43,588 --> 00:25:44,787
The old, weak, and ill

522
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:47,428
can't even join the exodus.

523
00:25:48,828 --> 00:25:49,467
Miss Song.

524
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:50,948
I know what you'll say.

525
00:25:51,507 --> 00:25:52,388
Save your breath.

526
00:25:53,307 --> 00:25:54,227
As a healer,

527
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:55,908
I won't abandon people

528
00:25:55,908 --> 00:25:56,547
in crisis.

529
00:25:58,428 --> 00:25:59,507
What are you thinking?

530
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:01,388
Don't you want me to leave?

531
00:26:02,388 --> 00:26:03,227
Come on!

532
00:26:03,668 --> 00:26:05,108
You haven't conceded defeat yet.

533
00:26:05,668 --> 00:26:06,707
And you want to escape?

534
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:07,747
Cheng Lisu.

535
00:26:07,747 --> 00:26:08,547
Besides,

536
00:26:09,188 --> 00:26:10,388
you aim to heal the world

537
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,348
and reform medical texts.

538
00:26:12,868 --> 00:26:14,227
No one should obstruct your path.

539
00:26:17,348 --> 00:26:18,428
Cheng Lisu.

540
00:26:19,747 --> 00:26:20,307
This time,

541
00:26:20,707 --> 00:26:21,828
let's see who saves more.

542
00:26:22,348 --> 00:26:23,588
It's also part of the contest.

543
00:26:24,267 --> 00:26:25,388
If you lose,

544
00:26:25,787 --> 00:26:26,628
you'll have to wash

545
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,547
my socks for a year.

546
00:26:28,868 --> 00:26:29,987
You're destined to lose.

547
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,267
There won't be

548
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:32,588
many women for you to rescue

549
00:26:32,707 --> 00:26:33,267
in combat.

550
00:26:34,267 --> 00:26:35,348
I won't lose.

551
00:26:37,148 --> 00:26:38,348
Then we'll see about that.

552
00:26:49,628 --> 00:26:50,908
If the heavens don't favor us

553
00:26:52,388 --> 00:26:53,547
on the day of battle,

554
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:55,148
what then?

555
00:26:58,628 --> 00:26:59,987
Every inch of Jiyang's land

556
00:27:01,428 --> 00:27:02,908
can become our burial ground.

557
00:27:05,547 --> 00:27:06,987
This is the conviction

558
00:27:08,108 --> 00:27:09,267
every soldier should possess.

559
00:27:10,108 --> 00:27:12,987
Rather die with shattered wings

560
00:27:13,628 --> 00:27:16,507
than endure separation
amidst the clouds.

561
00:27:21,668 --> 00:27:22,267
Today,

562
00:27:23,868 --> 00:27:24,868
the weather is clear.

563
00:28:02,588 --> 00:28:03,388
What's your plan?

564
00:28:04,227 --> 00:28:05,787
They've suddenly forced their march.

565
00:28:06,668 --> 00:28:08,868
If we want to win with fewer people,

566
00:28:09,707 --> 00:28:10,987
holding fortresses is crucial.

567
00:28:23,148 --> 00:28:23,840
Go.

568
00:28:31,188 --> 00:28:31,948
Be careful.

569
00:28:34,868 --> 00:28:35,428
Hurry.

570
00:28:35,668 --> 00:28:36,352
Go.

571
00:28:37,067 --> 00:28:37,787
Let's go there.

572
00:28:38,388 --> 00:28:38,987
Hurry.

573
00:28:39,227 --> 00:28:40,108
Go.

574
00:28:42,507 --> 00:28:43,067
Young Master,

575
00:28:43,507 --> 00:28:44,707
as the Military Inspector,

576
00:28:44,868 --> 00:28:46,227
you've done more than enough.

577
00:28:46,588 --> 00:28:47,388
You can't fight.

578
00:28:47,547 --> 00:28:48,428
For your safety,

579
00:28:48,588 --> 00:28:49,547
please leave the city.

580
00:28:49,868 --> 00:28:50,668
Leave this to me.

581
00:28:51,987 --> 00:28:53,227
I took on from Her Highness

582
00:28:53,547 --> 00:28:54,307
the evacuation

583
00:28:54,307 --> 00:28:55,588
and resettlement.

584
00:28:55,987 --> 00:28:56,948
I must finish it.

585
00:28:57,707 --> 00:28:58,828
I can't abandon the people

586
00:28:58,987 --> 00:28:59,747
to save myself.

587
00:29:00,428 --> 00:29:01,027
Moreover,

588
00:29:01,348 --> 00:29:02,348
Chai Anxi isn't found.

589
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:03,547
If I leave alone,

590
00:29:03,747 --> 00:29:05,027
how will I face my master?

591
00:29:05,948 --> 00:29:06,507
But...

592
00:29:06,507 --> 00:29:07,307
I've decided.

593
00:29:08,227 --> 00:29:08,864
Over here.

594
00:29:11,467 --> 00:29:12,227
Move aside!

595
00:29:19,188 --> 00:29:20,027
Thank you, sir.

596
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:24,307
Anyone else disrupting order

597
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:26,388
will be executed.

598
00:29:30,868 --> 00:29:32,188
Are you alright, sir?

599
00:29:33,628 --> 00:29:34,507
I'm fine. I'm fine.

600
00:29:35,388 --> 00:29:36,428
Thank you.

601
00:29:37,267 --> 00:29:38,227
There's an empty house

602
00:29:38,507 --> 00:29:39,467
ahead sheltering

603
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:40,668
lost elders and children.

604
00:29:41,188 --> 00:29:41,707
You can

605
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:43,507
stay there temporarily

606
00:29:43,668 --> 00:29:44,267
for shelter.

607
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:46,027
Okay, thank you.

608
00:29:46,747 --> 00:29:47,267
Yingxiang.

609
00:29:47,628 --> 00:29:48,348
Escort the elder.

610
00:29:48,547 --> 00:29:49,067
Yes.

611
00:29:51,188 --> 00:29:51,828
Thank you.

612
00:30:26,948 --> 00:30:27,467
Mr. Chu.

613
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:29,628
Mr. Chu.

614
00:30:32,188 --> 00:30:32,868
Are you alright?

615
00:30:35,148 --> 00:30:35,668
I'm fine.

616
00:30:35,987 --> 00:30:36,507
Thank you.

617
00:30:38,428 --> 00:30:39,828
When I bought the sugar painting,

618
00:30:39,987 --> 00:30:40,948
I noticed you seemed

619
00:30:41,188 --> 00:30:42,188
uneasy around fire.

620
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:44,507
Mr. Chu, are you afraid of fire?

621
00:30:45,547 --> 00:30:46,668
(Smoke him out to cleanse)

622
00:30:46,787 --> 00:30:47,428
(bad luck!)

623
00:30:47,908 --> 00:30:49,307
- Yes!
- Yes!

624
00:30:49,388 --> 00:30:49,908
Do it.

625
00:30:50,507 --> 00:30:51,188
Smoke him out.

626
00:30:51,467 --> 00:30:52,507
Your mother eloped.

627
00:30:52,547 --> 00:30:53,307
Serves you right.

628
00:30:53,668 --> 00:30:54,908
You fatherless boy.

629
00:30:55,108 --> 00:30:56,027
Illegitimate.

630
00:30:56,067 --> 00:30:57,267
Don't insult my mother!

631
00:31:00,267 --> 00:31:01,348
Mother.

632
00:31:01,507 --> 00:31:02,868
Mother.

633
00:31:05,507 --> 00:31:06,507
It's okay.

634
00:31:06,507 --> 00:31:07,668
Mother.

635
00:31:08,948 --> 00:31:09,467
Mr. Chu.

636
00:31:12,987 --> 00:31:13,547
Mr. Chu.

637
00:31:13,908 --> 00:31:14,467
I'm sorry.

638
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:15,547
I shouldn't ask you.

639
00:31:17,388 --> 00:31:18,016
It's okay.

640
00:31:18,987 --> 00:31:19,787
Thank you.

641
00:31:20,987 --> 00:31:21,507
Mr. Chu.

642
00:31:21,707 --> 00:31:23,027
You've already thanked me.

643
00:31:24,428 --> 00:31:25,388
I just remembered it.

644
00:31:25,628 --> 00:31:26,588
I have a garment

645
00:31:26,588 --> 00:31:28,188
made of mermaid silk fabric.

646
00:31:28,588 --> 00:31:29,428
The merchant claimed

647
00:31:29,428 --> 00:31:30,828
clothes crafted from this material

648
00:31:31,148 --> 00:31:31,987
are swordproof

649
00:31:32,188 --> 00:31:33,108
and resistant to fire.

650
00:31:33,908 --> 00:31:34,628
I'll have it sent

651
00:31:34,668 --> 00:31:35,588
to you later, Mr. Chu.

652
00:31:35,828 --> 00:31:36,428
This way,

653
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:37,547
you won't fear flames.

654
00:31:39,108 --> 00:31:39,987
It's settled then.

655
00:31:40,787 --> 00:31:42,428
Mr. Chu, I'll go patrol.

656
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:43,467
Stay cautious.

657
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:44,547
Be careful.

658
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:47,872
Let's go.

659
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:56,628
We just got news.

660
00:31:57,227 --> 00:31:57,908
The Wutuo Army

661
00:31:57,908 --> 00:31:58,707
suddenly sped up.

662
00:31:59,348 --> 00:32:00,467
They're 20 li

663
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:01,148
outside

664
00:32:01,507 --> 00:32:02,227
the south gate.

665
00:32:02,707 --> 00:32:03,267
I suspect

666
00:32:03,428 --> 00:32:04,747
they've got news

667
00:32:04,987 --> 00:32:06,227
about you being in Jiyang.

668
00:32:06,828 --> 00:32:07,948
They've always feared you.

669
00:32:08,267 --> 00:32:09,547
Knowing you're here,

670
00:32:09,948 --> 00:32:10,908
they'll surely exploit

671
00:32:11,188 --> 00:32:12,267
the lack of coordination

672
00:32:12,428 --> 00:32:13,507
between you and the troops

673
00:32:13,787 --> 00:32:14,747
to strike swiftly.

674
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,828
For us to overcome their numbers,

675
00:32:17,027 --> 00:32:19,227
speed will be crucial.

676
00:32:19,628 --> 00:32:20,320
So,

677
00:32:20,707 --> 00:32:21,747
this is our opportunity.

678
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:22,668
True.

679
00:32:22,868 --> 00:32:24,307
Our troops' morale is high.

680
00:32:24,707 --> 00:32:25,948
Civilians are encouraged.

681
00:32:26,267 --> 00:32:27,067
Both united

682
00:32:27,148 --> 00:32:27,948
to strike.

683
00:32:28,227 --> 00:32:29,707
This is our moment to repel Wutuo.

684
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,108
But

685
00:32:31,388 --> 00:32:32,507
Jiyang's limited forces

686
00:32:32,747 --> 00:32:33,908
remain our critical weakness.

687
00:32:34,227 --> 00:32:35,108
We need unusual ideas

688
00:32:35,307 --> 00:32:36,507
to reverse our fortunes.

689
00:32:36,668 --> 00:32:37,227
This time,

690
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:38,828
the Wutuo commander

691
00:32:39,148 --> 00:32:39,868
is Huyate.

692
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:41,747
Courageous in combat

693
00:32:41,987 --> 00:32:43,307
but stubbornly self-assured,

694
00:32:44,027 --> 00:32:45,428
with limited skill

695
00:32:45,787 --> 00:32:46,628
in formations.

696
00:32:46,948 --> 00:32:49,307
Disrupting his formation

697
00:32:49,828 --> 00:32:50,828
is key to victory.

698
00:32:51,868 --> 00:32:53,467
I've heard of Huyate.

699
00:32:53,987 --> 00:32:55,307
His heavy-armored troops

700
00:32:55,467 --> 00:32:56,227
are tough.

701
00:32:56,707 --> 00:32:57,987
But it decides the battle.

702
00:32:58,868 --> 00:33:00,307
You seem well-informed

703
00:33:00,628 --> 00:33:01,388
about Huyate.

704
00:33:04,868 --> 00:33:05,428
Commander,

705
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:06,588
after all,

706
00:33:06,588 --> 00:33:07,868
I aspire to be a general.

707
00:33:08,227 --> 00:33:09,908
It's my duty

708
00:33:10,067 --> 00:33:10,908
to study

709
00:33:11,067 --> 00:33:11,948
potential adversaries.

710
00:33:12,668 --> 00:33:13,216
See?

711
00:33:13,507 --> 00:33:14,908
This knowledge proves useful now.

712
00:33:15,467 --> 00:33:16,032
Commander.

713
00:33:17,908 --> 00:33:18,560
Commander.

714
00:33:19,267 --> 00:33:20,547
During the evacuation today,

715
00:33:20,948 --> 00:33:21,707
my men stationed

716
00:33:21,747 --> 00:33:22,707
at checkpoints

717
00:33:23,188 --> 00:33:23,707
didn't find

718
00:33:23,747 --> 00:33:24,547
Chai Anxi.

719
00:33:25,227 --> 00:33:25,868
He likely

720
00:33:26,027 --> 00:33:27,067
hasn't fled the city yet.

721
00:33:27,467 --> 00:33:28,588
In that case,

722
00:33:29,108 --> 00:33:29,987
he probably plans

723
00:33:30,027 --> 00:33:30,948
to escape

724
00:33:31,108 --> 00:33:32,027
once the battle begins.

725
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:32,948
But by then,

726
00:33:32,987 --> 00:33:34,227
the city will be surrounded,

727
00:33:34,628 --> 00:33:35,908
and we'll be stretched too thin.

728
00:33:37,868 --> 00:33:38,987
Continue the checks.

729
00:33:39,348 --> 00:33:40,227
Stay vigilant.

730
00:33:40,908 --> 00:33:42,467
If war truly breaks out,

731
00:33:44,108 --> 00:33:44,704
our priority

732
00:33:45,227 --> 00:33:46,227
is to defend Jiyang.

733
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:47,648
Yes.

734
00:34:12,348 --> 00:34:13,308
(I've guarded)

735
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:16,027
(this city for over two decades.)

736
00:34:17,507 --> 00:34:18,147
(This time,)

737
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,828
(I will surely protect it again.)

738
00:34:58,467 --> 00:34:59,027
(Master.)

739
00:34:59,547 --> 00:35:00,308
The Mengji throne

740
00:35:00,428 --> 00:35:01,987
doesn't require marriage alliances.

741
00:35:02,587 --> 00:35:04,228
Through generations
of rulers' diligence,

742
00:35:04,308 --> 00:35:05,308
they won over the people.

743
00:35:05,547 --> 00:35:07,948
Diligent governance is crucial,

744
00:35:08,187 --> 00:35:09,788
but through history,

745
00:35:09,948 --> 00:35:11,667
no woman has ever inherited the throne.

746
00:35:11,908 --> 00:35:13,507
Hongjin is Prince Mengji's sole child.

747
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:14,587
Legitimate.

748
00:35:15,027 --> 00:35:16,067
(Taoist Yunji)
A brave and smart woman

749
00:35:16,228 --> 00:35:17,187
rivals any man.

750
00:35:17,228 --> 00:35:18,908
These are just your personal views.

751
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:21,187
Though laws never stipulated

752
00:35:21,908 --> 00:35:23,908
only men can inherit the throne,

753
00:35:24,868 --> 00:35:26,667
some traditions

754
00:35:27,348 --> 00:35:28,828
have become unspoken rules

755
00:35:28,987 --> 00:35:30,268
in the public's mind.

756
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:31,987
Her gender alone

757
00:35:32,147 --> 00:35:34,147
gives opponents ground to challenge her.

758
00:35:34,627 --> 00:35:36,547
Hongjin will prove to the world

759
00:35:37,187 --> 00:35:38,388
she surpasses her ancestors.

760
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:41,228
I'll stand by her side.

761
00:35:42,228 --> 00:35:43,547
The nobles in Jiyang

762
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:45,107
won't grant her that time.

763
00:35:45,788 --> 00:35:46,467
Now,

764
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:47,708
only marriage

765
00:35:48,507 --> 00:35:50,268
can stabilize the situation

766
00:35:50,507 --> 00:35:51,708
and her position swiftly.

767
00:35:51,868 --> 00:35:52,828
I believe

768
00:35:53,308 --> 00:35:54,547
heaven never seals all doors.

769
00:35:54,788 --> 00:35:55,828
We can defy our destiny.

770
00:35:56,268 --> 00:35:57,948
You two might challenge fate,

771
00:35:58,547 --> 00:36:00,467
but victory demands sacrifice.

772
00:36:01,348 --> 00:36:02,627
Don't tell me

773
00:36:02,908 --> 00:36:03,908
you fear no hardship.

774
00:36:04,987 --> 00:36:05,788
The suffering

775
00:36:06,228 --> 00:36:08,428
won't just burden you two.

776
00:36:09,187 --> 00:36:10,268
When turmoil erupts,

777
00:36:11,027 --> 00:36:12,507
countless Jiyang citizens

778
00:36:12,708 --> 00:36:13,388
will inevitably

779
00:36:13,388 --> 00:36:15,467
endure hardships because of you.

780
00:36:18,627 --> 00:36:19,228
