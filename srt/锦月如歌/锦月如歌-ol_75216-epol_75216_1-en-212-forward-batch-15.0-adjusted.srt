1
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,199
(After being a substitute for so long,)

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,480
(will I forget)

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,719
(who I truly am?)

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,000
(They call me He Rufei.)

5
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:38,920
Kneel.

6
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,240
(The eldest son of the He family.)

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,759
(Since childhood,)

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,000
(I was disguised as a boy.)

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,039
(Visionary Foresight)

10
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,640
(I've always had to wear a mask.)

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,359
(They said,)

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,079
("live")

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,176
("without recognition")

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:55,840
("and die")

15
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,640
("without a trace.")

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:03,840
(I hated it.)

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,400
Remember.

18
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,560
(Yet found solace too.)

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,599
(This cold mask)

20
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,280
(smothered my identity)

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,959
(yet forged my purpose.)

22
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,120
(Amidst the smoke of war)

23
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,840
(and seas of blood,)

24
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,000
(I forgot life and death)

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,040
(and stopped wondering)

26
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,799
(who I am)

27
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,640
(beneath the mask.)

28
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,519
(From a nameless foot soldier,)

29
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:35,519
(I fought)

30
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:37,439
(to become
the invincible General Feihong.)

31
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,200
(But in the end,)

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,319
(who is General Feihong?)

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,000
(Who)

34
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,719
(am I?)

35

=Legend of The Female General=

56
00:03:52,056 --> 00:03:55,192
=Episode 1=

57
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,719
(In the 20th year
of Wei's Qingyuan era,)

58
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,639
(Battlefield of Mingshui)
(Wutuo invaded Wei again.)

59
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,919
(Emperor Chengping)

60
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,759
(ordered General Xiao Zhongwu,)

61
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,759
(Xiao Army's commander)

62
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,520
(who beat Wutuo five years ago,)

63
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,120
(Xiao Zhongwu, Xiao Army's Commander)
(to march to battle.)

64
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,759
(But at Mingshui's final battle,)

65
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,039
(30,000 Xiao troops)

66
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,919
(fell into an ambush.)

67
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,479
Xiao Zhongwu,

68
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,960
He Rufei's Fuyue Army

69
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,080
won't be coming.

70
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,599
Surrender,

71
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,280
and we'll spare you.

72
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,759
He Rufei

73
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:30,080
will come without fail!

74
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:33,160
Wei soldiers

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,839
choose death over surrender.

76
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,000
Charge!

77
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,040
General Xiao!

78
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,680
General Xiao!

79
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,959
General Xiao!

80
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:20,959
Father!

81
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:31,839
(Xiao Jue, styled Huaijin,
General Fengyun)

82
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,879
He Rufei,

83
00:05:33,176 --> 00:05:34,279
(General Feihong of Wei)

84
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,240
Huayuan is less than a hundred li
from Mingshui.

85
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,879
Why has your reinforcement
arrived so late?

86
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,639
A rope saws wood.

87
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:51,959
Water penetrates stones.

88
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,639
One day,

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,279
you two will become

90
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,120
Wei's Twin Stars.

91
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,720
With joint forces,

92
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,120
you shall wield the swords
to guard our land

93
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,480
and its people.

94
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,800
You are unworthy

95
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,000
of the Qinglang Sword
my father entrusted to you.

96
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,480
(Yaojing City)
General Feihong's returned triumphantly!

97
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,759
General Feihong!

98
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,279
Welcome, General Feihong!

99
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:45,304
(General Feihong's Mansion)

100
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:11,480
Young Master,

101
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,240
the Master awaits you in his study.

102
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,560
Ermao.

103
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,000
Madam,

104
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,360
now that you're here,

105
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,560
visit the Young Lady.

106
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,519
Watch your tongue.

107
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,759
There is only the Young Master.

108
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,360
The Young Lady...

109
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,984
(Tang Jia, He Yan's mother)

110
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,439
She's recuperating at Yuhua Temple.

111
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,816
Sit.

112
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,720
Yan,

113
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,519
you've been away for years,

114
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,519
(He Yuansheng, He Yan's father)
enduring military hardships.

115
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,839
It must have been hard.

116
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:16,480
Father,

117
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,759
it's not hard at all.

118
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,519
Honoring our family

119
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,720
fills me with joy.

120
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,328
Yan,

121
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm glad you're home.

122
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,519
For a young lady,

123
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,600
to wield weapons

124
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,920
is improper.

125
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,199
Honoring the family

126
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,040
should be men's duty.

127
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,800
Now that you're back,

128
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,800
it's time to embrace your true identity

129
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:37,720
as a woman.

130
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,120
About our family's title,

131
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,439
you don't need to worry.

132
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,360
I have a solution.

133
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,519
A solution?

134
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,279
What solution?

135
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,399
You've sacrificed

136
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,559
for our family for years.

137
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,919
It's been tough for you.

138
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:53,799
From now on,

139
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,519
let me handle these matters.

140
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,200
This is

141
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,799
your brother you never met,

142
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,559
(He Rufei, He Yan's elder brother)
He Rufei.

143
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,960
When you came

144
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,360
with your mother at three,

145
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,639
due to his congenital frailty,

146
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,919
he had been recuperating
at Yuhua Temple.

147
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,360
That's why you had to replace him.

148
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,799
Now

149
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,320
your brother has fully recovered

150
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,200
and returned.

151
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:16,960
Both of you

152
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,720
should return to your proper places.

153
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,960
Our family's act

154
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,600
of replacing a son

155
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,440
with a daughter

156
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,360
can then be quietly erased.

157
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,000
Father,

158
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,519
is this your solution?

159
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,080
Yan,

160
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,159
you must consider
our family's interests.

161
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,279
Our family

162
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,519
is a pillar of Confucian academia

163
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,799
and a leader in literary.

164
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,840
Now, abandoning culture
for martial pursuits,

165
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,919
- we...
- Father.

166
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,559
It was precisely to not disappoint you

167
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,720
and to guard

168
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,759
our family's honor

169
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,320
that I strove to achieve military glory.

170
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:56,720
I hoped that one day

171
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,080
I'd become a hero
like General Xiao Zhongwu.

172
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,879
You wished to emulate Xiao Zhongwu?

173
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,000
Xiao Zhongwu was a traitor to Wei.

174
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,399
It was all due to his reckless ambition

175
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,799
and warmongering.

176
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,799
Soldiers wield swords

177
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,320
to guard the land

178
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,000
and its people.

179
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,440
General Xiao taught me those words.

180
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,320
I refuse to believe

181
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,720
he was a warmonger.

182
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:22,840
Tomorrow, I'll attend court

183
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,240
and demand justice for General Xiao.

184
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,720
Even at the cost of my military honors,

185
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,279
I won't hesitate.

186
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,399
(Wei's Imperial Palace)
(In Mingshui Battle,)

187
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:42,240
(Wei lost over 30,000 soldiers.)

188
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,559
Commander Xiao Zhongwu
bears full responsibility.

189
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,360
(Emperor Chengping of Wei)
The Xiaos shall bury him as a commoner

190
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,600
and be stripped of military command

191
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,399
as punishment.

192
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,072
Your Majesty,

193
00:10:59,039 --> 00:10:59,879
my father

194
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,320
was no warmonger.

195
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,799
Our army had

196
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,960
ambushes set

197
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,840
throughout Mingshui.

198
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,120
Yet on the day of battle,

199
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,840
the Wutuo people

200
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,720
somehow destroyed
all ambush points beforehand.

201
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:15,120
There must have been
a leak of intelligence.

202
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,879
I implore Your Majesty
to reopen this case

203
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,919
to clear my father's name

204
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,200
and restore justice

205
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,720
for Xiao Army soldiers.

206
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,240
By imperial decree,

207
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:32,080
summon General Feihong, He Rufei.

208
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,879
I, He Rufei,
pay respects to Your Majesty.

209
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,879
Rise.

210
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,200
Thank you.

211
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,080
General He,

212
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,360
in Mingshui Battle,

213
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,759
was there more

214
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,919
to Xiao Army's defeat?

215
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:12,639
Your Majesty,

216
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,320
there was no more story

217
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,480
to Mingshui Battle.

218
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,879
If not for General Xiao's

219
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,120
reckless pursuit of glory

220
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,200
and direct confrontation with Wutuo,

221
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,559
coupled with his refusal

222
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:25,320
to request aid from our Fuyue Army,

223
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,879
how could the battle
have turned so tragic?

224
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,799
He Rufei!

225
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,879
General Fengyun,

226
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,559
I tried to reason with you.

227
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,679
Yet, to absolve your father's sins,

228
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,000
you twisted the truth

229
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,440
and made baseless accusations.

230
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,480
I mobilized troops immediately

231
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,159
upon receiving the distress message

232
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,720
without a moment's hesitation.

233
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,279
He Rufei,

234
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,720
after all these years apart,

235
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,559
why did you become so wretched?

236
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:12,720
You dare attempt

237
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,320
to plead for a sinner?

238
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,159
You're

239
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,080
dragging our entire family to graves.

240
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,120
- Father.
- (I've meticulously imitated)

241
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,879
(your handwriting
and behavioral patterns.)

242
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,600
(Imitating?)

243
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,840
(Since you're unwilling to swap identities,
we'll talk about it later.)

244
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,679
(You've sacrificed
a lot for your brother.)

245
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:27,600
(It's been tough.)

246
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,399
(Let your brother express
his gratitude to you)

247
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,960
(and have this cup of tea.)

248
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,320
General Fengyun
breached court etiquette.

249
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:55,799
But His Majesty acknowledges
the Xiao family's military merits.

250
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,840
As a warning, he shall be punished

251
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,399
with 20 strokes

252
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,080
and kneel outside the hall till dawn

253
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,799
to reflect on his transgressions.

254
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:24,376
(Memorial Tablet of Mother, Song Wan;
Memorial Tablet of Father, Xiao Zhongwu)

255
00:14:34,412 --> 00:14:35,896
(People's Guardian of Loyalty and Valor)

256
00:14:51,115 --> 00:14:52,482
(People's Guardian of Loyalty and Valor)

257
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,519
Punishment carried out.

258
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,600
Your Majesty,

259
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,600
I admit fault.

260
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:21,679
I request to lead troops to Que City

261
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,679
to reclaim our lost territory

262
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,000
and atone for my sins.

263
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,559
Your Majesty,

264
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,759
I'll sign a military pledge.

265
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,879
If Que City isn't reclaimed,

266
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,279
I vow never to return.

267
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,879
General Fengyun,

268
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,480
(Xu Jingfu, Prime Minister of Wei)
His Majesty has granted your request.

269
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:12,320
Gratitude to Your Majesty.

270
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,440
However, Wei's soldiers

271
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,480
shall not be sent to futile deaths.

272
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,600
Xiao Jue,

273
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:25,240
the court won't provide any troops.

274
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,519
Recover the territory

275
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,200
through your own means.

276
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,399
I

277
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:36,639
accept the decree.

278
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,840
Thanks, Your Majesty.

279
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,879
(Even if at the cost of all,)

280
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:06,519
(I will clear my father's name.)

281
00:17:10,956 --> 00:17:15,608
(Several days later)

282
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:25,048
(Yuhua Temple)

283
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:34,759
Miss.

284
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:38,519
Miss.

285
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,480
Take a walk with me by the roses.

286
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,784
Okay.

287
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:46,319
Be careful.

288
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,359
There are steps ahead.

289
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:00,599
(59, 60,)

290
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,400
(61...)

291
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,240
You're so straightforward,

292
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,599
unlike the delicate noble ladies

293
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,519
visiting the temple.

294
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:14,160
Yixin,

295
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:16,440
if I turn right

296
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:18,000
and go forward,

297
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:18,960
will it lead

298
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,160
to the rear courtyard wall?

299
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:22,680
Yes, it'll be the rear wall.

300
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,119
Beyond lies the hidden path I use

301
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,000
to leave here.

302
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
Past the canyon crevice,

303
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,319
it'll be beyond Yuhua Temple.

304
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,240
Show me around.

305
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:33,816
Okay.

306
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:43,256
(Ding Yi, He Rufei's guard)

307
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,319
Father showed mercy and spared her life

308
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,519
due to family ties.

309
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:51,160
But even blinded by poison,

310
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,519
she remains a threat.

311
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,119
I'll send her to Yuhua Temple first.

312
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,680
Watch her closely.

313
00:18:58,799 --> 00:18:59,960
Spread that word

314
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,599
that Miss He's condition
has suddenly worsened.

315
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,799
Then...

316
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,000
I will handle it impeccably.

317
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,359
(From meditation room to bridge,)

318
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,680
(it takes 61 steps.)

319
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,720
(After the bridge)

320
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,200
(and seven more steps,)

321
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,319
(I'll reach the roses by the pond.)

322
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,720
(Then bypass the roses and turn right.)

323
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,000
(Did I miscalculate my stride today?)

324
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,680
(Or did I miscount?)

325
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,759
Who are you?

326
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,640
Forgive me, miss.

327
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,480
I am merely

328
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:28,720
a devotee visiting this temple.

329
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,759
No offense.

330
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,240
Yuhua Temple's back courtyard
lies in the northwest corner.

331
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,319
Devotees' meditation rooms

332
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:37,079
are in the eastern part.

333
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:40,599
It seems you think

334
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,279
that I harbor ill intentions.

335
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:44,799
If you truly wish to die,

336
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:47,400
why care about my potential harm?

337
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,160
(Wishing to die?)

338
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:51,759
Our parents gave us

339
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,000
our physical forms.

340
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,519
One more step and you'd enter the pond.

341
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:59,079
If you disrespect life so casually

342
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:01,799
and disregard
your parents' nurturing grace,

343
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,319
then proceed as you will.

344
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,119
I won't stop you.

345
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,000
Nurturing grace?

346
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,559
They denied me even the chance

347
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:13,319
to speak.

348
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,680
They blinded me and abandoned me here.

349
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,119
In that case,

350
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:20,480
my life

351
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,359
is now mine to command.

352
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
In desperation,

353
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,960
death

354
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,640
becomes easier than living.

355
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,839
If you're truly tough,

356
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,880
blindness matters not.

357
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,200
Even blind,

358
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,920
aim to be

359
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,119
the most special of all.

360
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,759
Give me your hand.

361
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,200
This osmanthus candy

362
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,039
is the last piece left in the world.

363
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,039
Though inedible now,

364
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:04,039
it remains sweet.

365
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,880
I won't know

366
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,000
until I taste it.

367
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:14,599
Though bitter at first taste,

368
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,880
its core holds enduring sweetness.

369
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Is the moon tonight

370
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,200
beautiful?

371
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,640
Bright moon like frost.

372
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,720
Gentle breeze like water.

373
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:46,559
The serene beauty is endless.

374
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:02,960
I moved the roses

375
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,720
to stage an accidental drowning

376
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,480
for Young Lady at Yuhua Temple.

377
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:08,880
But Young Lady

378
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,359
was pulled back by Xiao Jue

379
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:12,559
and avoided falling.

380
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,839
Why would Xiao Jue

381
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:14,759
appear there?

382
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,519
No matter who intervenes,

383
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,359
that woman cannot be saved.

384
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,480
Let her escape then

385
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,640
and die

386
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,720
on her way to appeal to the emperor.

387
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:46,519
(Beyond lies the hidden path I use)

388
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:47,440
(to leave here.)

389
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,680
(Past the canyon crevice,
it'll be beyond Yuhua Temple.)

390
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,559
Young Lady, let me send you
on your final journey.

391
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,160
In your next life,
avoid being born a He.

392
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,400
Your continued existence
remains a threat

393
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,359
to the He family.

394
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,119
A mere woman

395
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,960
daring to seek military glory?

396
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:24,119
Preposterous delusions!

397
00:26:05,323 --> 00:26:09,304
(One month later)

398
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:45,319
(I can see again.)

399
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,000
(Where am I?)

400
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,279
(Didn't I die?)

401
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:21,000
With great effort,

402
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,559
I saved you

403
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,000
and restored your vision.

404
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,079
Why do you

405
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:24,799
keep moving?

406
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,680
Master.

407
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:29,080
(Liu Buwang, He Yan's master)

408
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,880
Last I saw you so weakened

409
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,640
was when I rescued you

410
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,680
from that mountain of corpses

411
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,160
on the battlefield.

412
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,279
Why ended up

413
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:40,160
like that again?

414
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:44,000
I thought

415
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,279
I could survive.

416
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,039
Unexpectedly,

417
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,599
I misjudged human nature.

418
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,039
They didn't just silence me

419
00:27:58,799 --> 00:27:59,880
but sought to ensure

420
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,480
I'd never speak again.

421
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,279
Your family

422
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,839
has mastered the art

423
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,799
of deception to perfection.

424
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,440
Master,

425
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:20,799
news was scarce at Yuhua Temple.

426
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:21,960
Do you know

427
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,480
how the Xiao family fares now?

428
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,119
Has General Xiao's name

429
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,240
been cleared?

430
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,680
The entire court

431
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,680
condemned Xiao Zhongwu.

432
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,920
To stabilize the court, His Majesty

433
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,119
declared him guilty soon

434
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,559
and almost

435
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,680
took away Xiao Army's
conscription rights.

436
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,400
How could this happen?

437
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,119
Didn't His Majesty investigate?

438
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,640
General Fengyun,

439
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,319
as fellow generals,

440
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,720
I deeply respect General Xiao.

441
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,160
But in matters of righteousness,

442
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,599
we must not speak falsely.

443
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,160
Righteousness?

444
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,759
Does your righteousness

445
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:56,960
mean delaying reinforcements

446
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,200
and letting my father,

447
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,759
along with 30,000 Xiao soldiers,

448
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:03,079
die in vain?

449
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:06,599
I immediately dispatched troops

450
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:08,359
upon receiving the distress call,

451
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,960
without any delay.

452
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:12,680
Had I not turned the tide,

453
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,079
Wutuo's cavalry

454
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,519
would have reached here long ago.

455
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,599
As a witness, General Feihong testified

456
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,839
before His Majesty

457
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,279
and firmly insisted

458
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,559
on Xiao Zhongwu's guilt.

459
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,119
With such crucial witnesses present,

460
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,920
they didn't look further.

461
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,599
He Rufei,

462
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,319
it was you

463
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:47,640
who delayed reinforcement

464
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,799
and caused my father

465
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,160
and the Xiao Army troops

466
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,680
to perish tragically!

467
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:58,480
Childhood classmates first,

468
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:00,160
and then

469
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,039
frontier commanders.

470
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:05,680
He Rufei,

471
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,039
after all these years apart,

472
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,839
why did you become so wretched?

473
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,079
(With my mask off)

474
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,759
(and my ties with the He family cut,)

475
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,759
(from now on,)

476
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,720
(I am simply He Yan.)

477
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,559
(In this vast world,)

478
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:09,000
(I'm no longer anyone's substitute.)

479
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,119
(He Rufei stole my title
as General Feihong,)

480
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,759
(tried to kill me, and ruined my name.)

481
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:19,200
(I won't let him off.)

482
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,359
(I will return to the army)

483
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
(and honorably)

484
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,119
(reclaim everything that's mine.)

485
00:31:40,588 --> 00:31:45,752
(Yezhou Garrison)

486
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,039
Thank you.
