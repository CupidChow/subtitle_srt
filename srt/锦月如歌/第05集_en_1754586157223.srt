1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let me run to the next level

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Go through the snowfall

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Climb over the high mountains

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hold my hand and I will live for love

5
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,000
In the depth of the mountains

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,480
You're going too far.

7
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,440
How dare you put your clothes in my shoe?

8
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,880
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,160
I didn't mean to do that.

10
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,400
The candies are all dirty.

11
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,400
Put them back.

12
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
You can't eat them, right?

13
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,240
No. I'll buy you a new one.

14
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,440
No need. I have class.

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,280
We've been investigating for so long.

16
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,640
But we didn't find anything.

17
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,600
Yes.

18
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,240
He Yan is not He Lu Fei or Xu Jing Fu

19
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,080
who is not registered in the military.

20
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,240
It's not easy to hide his identity.

21
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,800
Hide his identity?

22
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,880
Did you find anything?

23
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,440
It's an accident, right?

24
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,280
Let's continue the investigation.

25
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,240
Yes.

26
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,200
Why did you take the food out of the bag?

27
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,480
Sun Xiang Fu, the county magistrate of Yezhou,

28
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,160
said that the food was not well received today.

29
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,240
The stores were all in debt.

30
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,640
The grain warehouse in the county was also in a hurry.

31
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,720
We couldn't get any food.

32
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,560
It's just a lie.

33
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,200
We were busy before.

34
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,880
Now we are in a hurry.

35
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,440
Although we are not in a hurry,

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,320
we have a problem.

37
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,920
Xu Jing Fu must have made him put you in a difficult position.

38
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,480
Xu Jing Fu transferred me to Yezhou

39
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,360
and asked me to stay away from the capital.

40
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,960
I have no place to return to.

41
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,400
He never thought that

42
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,360
Yezhou was the place you chose to live.

43
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,960
But now you have trained these bad guys

44
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,520
so well that they can't be stopped.

45
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,560
They are starting to make a fuss about the grain.

46
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,800
That's right.

47
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,200
The new soldiers are not stable.

48
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,120
The weather is good.

49
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,960
The grain is short.

50
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,640
If some rumors about the treasure are spread,

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,320
I will be very happy

52
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,560
to work with these new soldiers.

53
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,400
What should we do?

54
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,120
The remaining grain should last for a while.

55
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,240
When the competition ends,

56
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,320
I will meet this Sun Xiang Fu in person.

57
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,600
I can also see

58
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,320
what kind of chess piece

59
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Xu Jing Fu is setting up in Yezhou.

60
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,200
He Yan.

61
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,680
The one who used to be the Qing Emperor

62
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,960
hated you,

63
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,240
hated you,

64
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,560
and killed you.

65
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,440
Since the life of the new Emperor was changed to a new one,

66
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,240
from now on,

67
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,880
He Yan's life

68
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,600
will be up to He Yan himself.

69
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,180
He.

70
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,840
Look!

71
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,720
What a wonderful clear dish!

72
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,720
Brother He.

73
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,640
The crane lantern is so ugly.

74
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,840
Those should be YOUR own.

75
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,400
Mr. Chun.

76
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,720
Your crane lantern

77
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,200
is too big!

78
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,200
So we have to make it bigger.

79
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,040
It's more lively when two families are together.

80
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,040
It's not lonely.

81
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,480
My grandmother is most afraid of loneliness.

82
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,160
Mrs. Xiao passed away too?

83
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,480
Yes.

84
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,120
Grandmother and grandfather have a good relationship.

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,360
After grandfather passed away,

86
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,160
grandmother was deeply hurt.

87
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,720
After Huaijin sent the spirit of grandfather back to the house,

88
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,360
she also killed herself.

89
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,480
So she was very lonely.

90
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,480
In fact, Huaijin is also very lonely.

91
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,320
Our family, including my mother,

92
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,520
and the close friends of the Xiao family,

93
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,000
don't like her very much.

94
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,920
They like my uncle more,

95
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,480
which is Huaijin's brother, Xiao Jing.

96
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,120
Why?

97
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,160
Aren't they all the children of the Xiao family?

98
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,400
The Xiao family is a family of five.

99
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,600
A son must be in the army.

100
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,560
But Xiao Jing is so happy to be with her.

101
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,520
But Xiao Jing is so happy to be with her.

102
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,080
She doesn't like to be armed.

103
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,880
In order to fulfill her brother's wish,

104
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,360
Huaijin took the initiative to join the army.

105
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,040
She took on the responsibility of family.

106
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,280
She joined the army early.

107
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,680
She has been raised in a cold family for many years.

108
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,920
She is not very close to her family.

109
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,600
Not to mention our relatives.

110
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,080
Even her mother,

111
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't know how to get along with her.

112
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,560
That's right.

113
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,480
They have been away for too long.

114
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,040
They are not familiar with each other.

115
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,000
It's hard to avoid a new born.

116
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,680
It seems you can't see your future.

117
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,280
Brother He, it's late.

118
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,400
Then I am going back to the camp.

119
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,920
Go back early.

120
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,080
I can see it clearly

121
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,020
even without giving a clue.

122
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,760
Seven or eight points of pain.

123
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,660
Taking this in your hands,

124
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,380
I can tellポTNT is both ondeast and hot.

125
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,240
It's so amazing.

126
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,940
I heard you all enjoy

127
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,280
這裡的花燒很。

128
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,120
Hope you can

129
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,020
trust me enough

130
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,460
to tear up my pact all the way.

131
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,200
The world is in chaos

132
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,840
We need to solve it with our lives

133
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,200
How do you know

134
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,600
I don't think it's the wish of the dead

135
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,400
The regret of the dead

136
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,280
is done by the living

137
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,680
This is my promise to them

138
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,560
Think about it

139
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,920
I'll give you some

140
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,200
It's my gratitude for saving me that day

141
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,520
No need

142
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,720
This one

143
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,080
It's for the people of Ji Dianhu

144
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,000
The spirits of Ma Ge Fruit

145
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,480
And your family

146
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,880
I don't know what you call it

147
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,080
But the blessings are real

148
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,480
Not bad

149
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,400
Ei reward

150
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,760
They don't want me to die

151
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,100
This is called digging

152
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,680
Maybe

153
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,120
the spirits like it

154
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,200
The Governor thinks I look amiable

155
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:26,940
And I'm not

156
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,880
The仔才200

157
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,360
I just play a good piece

158
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,080
So trying

159
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,400
Handing

160
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,600
That's just getting hand holding

161
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,680
Why does this girl

162
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,080
long long like

163
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,840
the setting sun filling the first snow

164
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,920
I look at you all the time,

165
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,920
but you are slowly disappearing.

166
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,920
How do I know

167
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:21,920
that you are still in my dream?

168
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,920
My heart is like a butterfly that never changes.

169
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,920
When the stars and the moon are all in your heart,

170
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,920
the flowers will fall like the beautiful eyes.

171
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,920
The red thread is like a thread that is entwined with the thread of love.

172
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,920
I will make a promise.

173
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,920
The time and space are like the end of the world.

174
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,920
The heart and the fragrance are like the thread of dreams.

175
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,920
When the stars and the moon are all in your heart,

176
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
the flowers will fall like the beautiful eyes.

177
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,920
I have done a great job.

178
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
You can let go now.

179
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,920
The night is slowly fading away.

180
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,920
The moon and the moon are like the beautiful eyes.

181
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,920
The time and space are like the beautiful eyes.

182
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,920
The night is slowly fading away.

183
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
The moon and the moon are like the beautiful eyes.

184
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
Wake up.

185
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
What is there to fear in this life?

186
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,920
I am going to be with you.

187
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,920
I will be with you.

188
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,920
When the stars and the moon are all in your heart,

189
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,920
the flowers will fall like the beautiful eyes.

190
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,920
The red thread is like a thread that is entwined with the thread of love.

191
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,920
I will make a promise.

192
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,920
The time and space are like the end of the world.

193
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,920
The moon and the moon are like the beautiful eyes.

194
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,920
The night is slowly fading away.

195
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,920
The moon and the moon are like the beautiful eyes.

196
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,920
Wake up.

197
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,920
When the stars and the moon are all in your heart,

198
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,920
the flowers will fall like the beautiful eyes.

199
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,920
The red thread is like a thread that is entwined with the thread of love.

200
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,920
I will make a promise.

201
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,920
When the stars and the moon are all in your heart,

202
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,920
the flowers will fall like the beautiful eyes.

203
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:38,920
I will make a promise.

204
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,920
The moon and the moon are like the beautiful eyes.

205
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:54,920
Will the one who is dead be able to enjoy this moment with the living?

206
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,920
He will.

207
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,920
The Long Ballad

208
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,920
Episode 16

209
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:42,000
The Stronghold of the

210
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
New Soldiers, listen up!

211
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,920
There are red flags all over Mount Baiyue.

212
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,920
There are 15 flags in total.

213
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,920
This time, the flag is the sun is setting.

214
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,920
You must return to this place and hold the red flag.

215
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,920
You must take the flag of the most noble class.

216
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,920
Remember, you must not cross the mountain.

217
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,920
You must not hurt anyone.

218
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,920
The one who breaks the rule will be punished.

219
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,920
Yes!

220
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,920
After this battle,

221
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,920
I will choose one of the best new soldiers

222
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,920
to enter our Nine Banners Battalion.

223
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,920
Soldiers, set out!

224
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
Yes!

225
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
This is the map of Mount Baiyue.

226
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,920
Where did you send it?

227
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
I noticed it when I was searching for the mountain.

228
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,920
I drew a picture when I came back.

229
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,920
You were being dragged by wolves in the mountain.

230
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,920
Can you still remember the route?

231
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,920
I also took a look at the route when I was chased by wolves.

232
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,920
I remembered it when I came back.

233
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,920
It's quite familiar.

234
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,920
You must believe your boss.

235
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,920
The military is a great country.

236
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,920
It's a great country.

237
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,920
The military usually plays chess in the plain and water sources.

238
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,920
These conspicuous places play chess.

239
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,920
So, the closest place to the foot of the mountain

240
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,920
should be in these mountainous areas with wide open field.

241
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,920
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

242
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,920
No. Let's not get into this mess.

243
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,920
Those conspicuous places are just some famous places.

244
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,920
There must be a lot of teams that will discover them.

245
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,920
If we go there now, we will definitely fall into a chaos.

246
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,920
So, let's go here.

247
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,920
This place is dense with forest.

248
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,920
We have to climb over a cliff.

249
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
This path is not easy to walk.

250
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,920
This is a trick that the teachers use.

251
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,920
They will give you a field dates and then hit you with a stick.

252
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Of course, you have to increase the difficulty.

253
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
Otherwise, what are you fighting for?

254
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,920
Just hit a platform.

255
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,920
Let's go.

256
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,920
It's not easy to walk over the cliff of the Moon Mountain.

257
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,920
I think that no one can take this flag down.

258
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
A new disease will not work.

259
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
But if you are experienced,

260
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,920
you will definitely be able to see the purpose of your trip that day.

261
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,920
You will be able to see through the grass and the wood of the Moon Mountain.

262
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,920
There are people like this in our Yezhou Guards?

263
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
Yes.

264
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
He Yan.

265
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,920
He Yan.

266
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,920
This flag is in such a dangerous place.

267
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,920
A He, it's only you who can take it.

268
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,920
Be careful.

269
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,920
Brother A He.

270
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,920
Brother A He, you are here.

271
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Brother A He, you are here.

272
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,920
Brother A He, you are here.

273
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
Brother A He, you are really amazing.

274
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,920
Just by picking up a single fan,

275
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,920
He Yan is so familiar with the terrain of the Moon Mountain.

276
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,920
He is really a young man.

277
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,920
But I think Lei Hou is better.

278
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,920
Lei Hou's team is all good players.

279
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
To take the flag, you need the team's cooperation,

280
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,920
not individual courage.

281
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,920
Therefore, it is more important to know how to command and lead the troops than to hit hard.

282
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,920
So I still want He Yan.

283
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
Big Sister.

284
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,920
Although the members of He Yan's team are both good,

285
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,920
they all have their own advantages.

286
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,920
If we can discover their advantages,

287
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,920
it is indeed not easy to arrange the troops.

288
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,920
Start the attack.

289
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,920
Do you accept it?

290
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
Yes.

291
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,920
This...

292
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,920
Where is the flag?

293
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,920
On the hill?

294
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
We will set up an ambush.

295
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
No.

296
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,920
Who says I want to prey on that flag.

297
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,920
Chief,

298
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,360
Uncle He Yan had isolated himself from everyone

299
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,760
andДа Jie has discovered a lot of flags.

300
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,920
He wants to choose a path to go,

301
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,820
to wait for his turn to be executed for the biology

302
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:47,740
Who else will take the last chest length of

303
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,260
the valley this time

304
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,260
It's really impressive.

305
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,260
No, no.

306
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,260
Now we are playing with different sides.

307
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,260
Who can get the last side of the valley

308
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,260
to decide the winner?

309
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,260
The valley is a very important place.

310
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,260
If you can win it now,

311
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,260
it would be great to take the second step.

312
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,260
The second step is good,

313
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,260
but I want to take the first step.

314
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,260
Okay.

315
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,260
Let's meet at the valley.

316
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,260
Okay.

317
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,260
Brother Lei,

318
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,260
it's boring to fight like this.

319
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,260
Let's change the style.

320
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,260
Say it.

321
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,260
What style?

322
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,260
Single-choice.

323
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,260
The loser gives up all the pawns.

324
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,260
Just them?

325
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,260
That's not good, Brother He.

326
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,260
Why did you get it so easily?

327
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,260
It's okay.

328
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,260
Don't worry.

329
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,260
If you really get it,

330
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,260
I won't give you up.

331
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,260
Don't lose the second one.

332
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,260
I don't like to fight either.

333
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,260
But no one can take what I want.

334
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,260
So I can only beat you.

335
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,260
He Yuan,

336
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,260
it's your turn.

337
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,260
Let's see who wins.

338
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,260
I won.

339
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,260
I won.

340
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,260
I won.

341
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,260
I won.

342
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,260
I won.

343
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,260
I won.

344
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,260
I won.

345
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,260
I won.

346
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,260
I won.

347
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,260
I won.

348
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,260
I won.

349
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,260
I won.

350
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,260
I lost.

351
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,260
You've finally found a type.

352
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,260
It's the last one.

353
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,260
This is not the game.

354
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,260
It's not really treating him with respect.

355
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,260
You're just playing tricks to set him up.

356
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,260
What did I do wrong?

357
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,260
Let him be.

358
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,260
Let him be.

359
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,260
I don't believe you.

360
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,260
Why are you good at this?

361
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,260
Let him be.

362
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,060
The

363
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,560
symbol

364
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:55,060
of Jin Zan

365
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,440
dead

366
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,560
everything

367
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,360
Zi Shan

368
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,040
what

369
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,160
did he say

370
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,400
Commander,

371
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,040
the 15 chess pieces

372
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,480
are all in He Yan's hands.

373
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,160
He Yan Clan has returned to the camp.

374
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,600
You've lost.

375
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,040
Commander,

376
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,640
not only is the chess skill good,

377
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,880
but also the skill of garrison.

378
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,640
I'm

379
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,280
flattered.

380
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,640
If he was really ordered

381
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,800
to come to Yezhou,

382
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,920
he wouldn't have been so eager

383
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,840
to show his face in front of me.

384
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,760
But he's not as calm as he seems.

385
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,360
He Yan,

386
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,320
what do you want?

387
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,520
Commander,

388
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,120
the game has ended.

389
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,080
Shall we start the trial now?

390
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,560
No hurry.

391
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,680
It'll be the Mid-Autumn Festival in five days.

392
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,320
It's not too late to start the trial.

393
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,480
Then,

394
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,520
who will enter the Jiuxi Camp?

395
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,680
Commander,

396
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,200
do you have a decision?

397
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,720
It will start the trial.

398
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,160
Chess iscken.

399
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,840
So I simply

400
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,320
discuss with

401
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,260
the scholars a rhythm and

402
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,760
rhythm rhythm

403
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,000
for the hardest setup

404
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,080
of these orders.

405
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,160
After that,

406
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,920
I can start

407
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,800
ancient relation with

408
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,560
Jiuxi Camp.

409
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,560
Please come time after time.

410
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,920
We dumplings

411
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:39,920
we also serve earth

412
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:55,620
you two

413
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,760
I will eat them all

414
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,760
I told you not to take my time

415
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,360
Master, I didn't disappoint you.

416
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,720
You won the first place in the competition.

417
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,120
You were able to enter the Nine-Qin Camp

418
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,600
thanks to your teaching and cultivation.

419
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,640
This is a flower pot that I personally made.

420
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,960
These fifteen-sided chess pieces

421
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,600
are the honor I've just earned.

422
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,800
I'm fully grateful for it.

423
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,160
Please accept it, Master.

424
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,480
I'm so happy.

425
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,200
I'm so happy.

426
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,080
I'm so happy.

427
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,680
I'm so happy.

428
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,360
Highland.

429
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,320
You're quite good at sticking gold on your face.

430
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,800
How can this be gold?

431
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,600
Isn't there a word of good poetry written on it?

432
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,800
With this kind of affection,

433
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,400
I'll enter the Nine-Qin Camp in the future.

434
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,480
I'll surely treat you like a friend.

435
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,360
I won't leave you. I'll follow you as your shadow.

436
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,520
It's a pity that you won't read books

437
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,840
for the brothers with this kind of talent.

438
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,400
Master, how can you only look at my talent

439
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,040
and not at my food?

440
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,640
If I enter the Nine-Qin Camp,

441
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,720
I'll surely be your capable teacher in the future.

442
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,840
He Yan,

443
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,480
you really want to enter the Nine-Qin Camp?

444
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,520
That's right.

445
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,760
If I don't enter the Nine-Qin Camp,

446
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,840
it'll be a loss for you.

447
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,000
I won't allow you to suffer such a huge loss.

448
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,840
Director,

449
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,600
all the teachers have arrived at the tent.

450
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,520
They are waiting for you to discuss some important matters.

451
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,200
Director, military affairs are important.

452
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,080
You can go ahead.

453
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,360
We have a lot of chances anyway.

454
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,160
Wait.

455
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,400
Take the snacks on the table and eat them.

456
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,120
Thank you, Director.

457
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
General,

458
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,400
we have no conflict in any way.

459
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
If we can have a good discussion,

460
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,400
we can have a good discussion.

461
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,200
I didn't mean to disappear on that day.

462
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,600
I just felt a little worried recently.

463
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,800
I'm a little angry.

464
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,400
I wonder what you are worried about.

465
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,800
I'm still a little anxious.

466
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
I went to Yezhou and it's not quiet.

467
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
I'm worried about you.

468
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
I'm worried about you.

469
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
I'm worried about you.

470
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,400
I went to Yezhou and it's not quiet.

471
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,600
I practiced the taste of Yezhou for a lifetime.

472
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,200
I asked the teacher to give me some money

473
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,600
to give me some money to donate to Yezhou.

474
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,600
I couldn't get the money

475
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,000
and I couldn't give up.

476
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,200
I couldn't give up.

477
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,200
Sometimes I'm too tired

478
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,200
to go to Yezhou for a trip.

479
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,000
I have to make some adjustments.

480
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,600
But I've never been to Yezhou.

481
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,600
Besides,

482
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
I'm just a scholar.

483
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,400
I'm not like you.

484
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,600
I'm very talented.

485
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,400
I only have one maid.

486
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,200
My guard has some skills.

487
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,000
When Mr. Chu arrives in Yezhou,

488
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,400
if you need anything,

489
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,000
just tell him to do it.

490
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,800
That's great.

491
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,600
But I'm a slow talker.

492
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
I'll let you handle it.

493
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,600
How about

494
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,400
I meet with your guard in Yezhou?

495
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,800
That's fine.

496
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,000
I'll take my leave.

497
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,000
When you arrive in Yezhou,

498
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,400
go to Sun Xiangfu

499
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,800
and ask him to cooperate with you.

500
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,200
General,

501
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,200
will it affect you?

502
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,200
What are you afraid of?

503
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,600
Yezhou is his territory.

504
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,800
Even if something happens,

505
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,000
it's his fault.

506
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,200
It has nothing to do with me.

507
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,200
Chu Zhao wants to attack the Prime Minister.

508
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,600
He can't take the lead.

509
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,800
So, Ding Yi,

510
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,800
you must succeed.

511
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,800
Don't fail.

512
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,000
Yes.

513
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,400
Mother,

514
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,800
I'm going to Yezhou.

515
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
I'm afraid I can't talk to you

516
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,200
in Yezhou.

517
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,600
Young Master,

518
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,000
He Rufei hates your strong aura

519
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,400
and is eager to show off in front of the school.

520
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,400
If his men go to Yezhou,

521
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,200
I'm afraid it will be bad.

522
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,800
How can it be bad?

523
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,400
He is obviously a helper.

524
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,000
He Rufei's new father,

525
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,400
Wu Yi,

526
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,800
is not under your control.

527
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,200
He can fight against Xiao Jue.

528
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,600
It can save me a lot of effort.

529
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
Besides, he can do it.

530
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,000
It's a big deal.

531
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,600
We can't find out the teacher.

532
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
I can also hide in the dark

533
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,400
and watch them

534
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
stir up the water in Yezhou.

535
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,200
I'll find a chance

536
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,800
to get what Sun Xiangfu has.

537
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
Cheers.

538
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,600
It's good.

539
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,000
Okay, thank you.

540
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,200
Try it.

541
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,400
It's a vegetarian dish again.

542
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,800
The meat will be here soon.

543
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,800
The meat is here.

544
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,000
Let's eat and drink today.

545
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,400
Yes.

546
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,600
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

547
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,400
Come on.

548
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,800
Let me try it.

549
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,000
He Yan.

550
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,600
He Yan.

551
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,000
Why are you always walking around?

552
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,600
What's so good about it?

553
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,000
Isn't it Mid-Autumn Festival today?

554
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Why hasn't Duoduo come yet?

555
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Huaijin won't come.

556
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,800
Why?

557
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,800
Why are you suddenly

558
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,800
so concerned about Huaijin?

559
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
Isn't he going to announce

560
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,400
the candidate to enter the Jiuxi Camp?

561
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,400
It's so important.

562
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,800
He won't come in person?

563
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,000
If he comes,

564
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,200
will you guys

565
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,400
still eat and drink?

566
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,000
Come on.

567
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,200
That's good.

568
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,400
He's not comfortable.

569
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,400
He's not comfortable

570
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
in such a lively place.

571
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,000
So,

572
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
why can't we find him?

573
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,600
Come on.

574
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
The first one in the wild.

575
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,400
This one is for you.

576
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,600
Come on, guys.

577
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,000
Let's share it.

578
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,400
Okay.

579
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
Okay.

580
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I should have come.

581
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,600
It's okay to wait for a while.

582
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
When I enter the Jiuxi Camp,

583
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,600
I'll be one step closer

584
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,400
to returning to the general position.

585
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
Yes.

586
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Thank you, sir.

587
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,200
Continue eating.

588
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,200
Leave me alone.

589
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,000
Don't gather here.

590
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,600
Sit down.

591
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,400
Yes.

592
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,200
Today,

593
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
although it's a Mid-Autumn Festival banquet,

594
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,600
it's your celebration.

595
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,400
You shouldn't drink in the camp,

596
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
but you are the first to get the flag.

597
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,200
I'll give you

598
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,000
this reward.

599
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,400
Slow down.

600
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,200
Tomorrow's campaign

601
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,560
No one is allowed to eat the knife

602
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,800
Otherwise, the military law will be punished

603
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,800
Yes

604
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,440
Yes

605
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,600
Give me the bowl

606
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,640
Come on

607
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:18,920
Look at you

608
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,160
Instructor Shen

609
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,000
What's up?

610
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,520
Instructor Shen

611
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,760
Are you here to announce

612
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,120
the selection of the candidates for the nine-star hotel?

613
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,760
Instructor Shen

614
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,560
Do you have something good to tell me?

615
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
Do you want to tell us?

616
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,480
Yes, Instructor Shen

617
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,240
Just tell us

618
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,240
Don't sell the coffin

619
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,240
Yes

620
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,680
Yes

621
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,040
After I give you the reward

622
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,680
I will go to Lei Hou

623
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,800
and thank him

624
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,320
Lei Hou

625
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,360
Lei Hou

626
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,080
Isn't it He Yan?

627
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,040
No, Instructor Shen

628
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,600
Brother He is the first

629
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,360
The first is great, right?

630
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,120
Do what you should do

631
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,080
What are you doing?

632
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,920
I tell you

633
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,800
The selection of the nine-star hotel

634
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,960
is measured by the overall score

635
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,320
It's just one of the rounds

636
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,400
He Yan

637
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,360
Cheer up

638
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,880
You are a good person

639
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,680
You will have a chance in the future

640
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,320
comer

641
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,960
Thank you

642
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,880
have a good meal

643
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,680
I've seen the mountains and the rivers, I've climbed over the ice and frost,

644
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,680
I've been through the night and the day, I've been through the night and the day.

645
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,680
It's fate and faith, the ideal is for you to light up the wind.

646
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,680
Unworthy wishes, I look at them in the dark, who cares about the wildness?

647
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:18,680
I'll go through the heat and the cold, I'll fight with my will.

648
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,680
Flying in the world, there must be hope.

649
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,680
Overcome those wounds, search for the light.

650
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:36,680
The light in the starry sea, open your wound, point me to you.

651
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:42,680
The courage to return to the light, is the courage to exist.

652
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,680
The light in the starry sea, light up the strength to be born.

653
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,080
I've met the

654
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:01,680
I deserve the truth, you accompany me to create.
