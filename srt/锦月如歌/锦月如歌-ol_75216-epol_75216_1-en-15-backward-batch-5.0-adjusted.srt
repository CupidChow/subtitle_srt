1
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,199
(After being a substitute for so long,)

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,480
(will I forget)

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,719
(who I truly am?)

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,000
(They call me He Rufei.)

5
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:23,920
Kneel.

6
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,240
(The eldest son of the He family.)

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,759
(Since childhood,)

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,000
(I was disguised as a boy.)

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,039
(Visionary Foresight)

10
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:33,640
(I've always had to wear a mask.)

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,359
(They said,)

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,079
("live")

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,176
("without recognition")

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:40,840
("and die")

15
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,640
("without a trace.")

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:48,840
(I hated it.)

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,400
Remember.

18
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:51,560
(Yet found solace too.)

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,599
(This cold mask)

20
00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:56,280
(smothered my identity)

21
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,959
(yet forged my purpose.)

22
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,120
(Amidst the smoke of war)

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,840
(and seas of blood,)

24
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,000
(I forgot life and death)

25
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,040
(and stopped wondering)

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,799
(who I am)

27
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,640
(beneath the mask.)

28
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:18,519
(From a nameless foot soldier,)

29
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,519
(I fought)

30
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:22,439
(to become
the invincible General Feihong.)

31
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,200
(But in the end,)

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,319
(who is General Feihong?)

33
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,000
(Who)

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,719
(am I?)

35

56

=Episode 1=

57
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,719
(In the 20th year
of Wei's Qingyuan era,)

58
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,639
(Battlefield of Mingshui)
(Wutuo invaded Wei again.)

59
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,919
(Emperor Chengping)

60
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,759
(ordered General Xiao Zhongwu,)

61
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,759
(Xiao Army's commander)

62
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,520
(who beat Wutuo five years ago,)

63
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,120
(Xiao Zhongwu, Xiao Army's Commander)
(to march to battle.)

64
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,759
(But at Mingshui's final battle,)

65
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,039
(30,000 Xiao troops)

66
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,919
(fell into an ambush.)

67
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,479
Xiao Zhongwu,

68
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,960
He Rufei's Fuyue Army

69
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,080
won't be coming.

70
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,599
Surrender,

71
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,280
and we'll spare you.

72
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,759
He Rufei

73
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,080
will come without fail!

74
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,160
Wei soldiers

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,839
choose death over surrender.

76
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,000
Charge!

77
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,040
General Xiao!

78
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,680
General Xiao!

79
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,959
General Xiao!

80
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:50,959
Father!

81
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:01,839
(Xiao Jue, styled Huaijin,
General Fengyun)

82
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,879
He Rufei,

83
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:04,279
(General Feihong of Wei)

84
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,240
Huayuan is less than a hundred li
from Mingshui.

85
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,879
Why has your reinforcement
arrived so late?

86
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,639
A rope saws wood.

87
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:21,959
Water penetrates stones.

88
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,639
One day,

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,279
you two will become

90
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,120
Wei's Twin Stars.

91
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,720
With joint forces,

92
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,120
you shall wield the swords
to guard our land

93
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,480
and its people.

94
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,800
You are unworthy

95
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,000
of the Qinglang Sword
my father entrusted to you.

96
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,480
(Yaojing City)
General Feihong's returned triumphantly!

97
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,759
General Feihong!

98
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,279
Welcome, General Feihong!

99
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:15,304
(General Feihong's Mansion)

100
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:41,480
Young Master,

101
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,240
the Master awaits you in his study.

102
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,560
Ermao.

103
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,000
Madam,

104
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,360
now that you're here,

105
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,560
visit the Young Lady.

106
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,519
Watch your tongue.

107
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,759
There is only the Young Master.

108
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,360
The Young Lady...

109
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,984
(Tang Jia, He Yan's mother)

110
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,439
She's recuperating at Yuhua Temple.

111
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:31,816
Sit.

112
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,720
Yan,

113
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,519
you've been away for years,

114
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,519
(He Yuansheng, He Yan's father)
enduring military hardships.

115
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,839
It must have been hard.

116
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,480
Father,

117
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,759
it's not hard at all.

118
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,519
Honoring our family

119
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,720
fills me with joy.

120
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,328
Yan,

121
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm glad you're home.

122
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,519
For a young lady,

123
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,600
to wield weapons

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,920
is improper.

125
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,199
Honoring the family

126
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,040
should be men's duty.

127
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,800
Now that you're back,

128
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,800
it's time to embrace your true identity

129
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,720
as a woman.

130
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,120
About our family's title,

131
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,439
you don't need to worry.

132
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,360
I have a solution.

133
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:14,519
A solution?

134
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,279
What solution?

135
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,399
You've sacrificed

136
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,559
for our family for years.

137
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:19,919
It's been tough for you.

138
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,799
From now on,

139
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,519
let me handle these matters.

140
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,200
This is

141
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,799
your brother you never met,

142
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,559
(He Rufei, He Yan's elder brother)
He Rufei.

143
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:33,960
When you came

144
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,360
with your mother at three,

145
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,639
due to his congenital frailty,

146
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,919
he had been recuperating
at Yuhua Temple.

147
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,360
That's why you had to replace him.

148
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,799
Now

149
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,320
your brother has fully recovered

150
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,200
and returned.

151
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:46,960
Both of you

152
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,720
should return to your proper places.

153
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,960
Our family's act

154
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,600
of replacing a son

155
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,440
with a daughter

156
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,360
can then be quietly erased.

157
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,000
Father,

158
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,519
is this your solution?

159
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,080
Yan,

160
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,159
you must consider
our family's interests.

161
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,279
Our family

162
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,519
is a pillar of Confucian academia

163
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,799
and a leader in literary.

164
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,840
Now, abandoning culture
for martial pursuits,

165
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:17,919
- we...
- Father.

166
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,559
It was precisely to not disappoint you

167
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,720
and to guard

168
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,759
our family's honor

169
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,320
that I strove to achieve military glory.

170
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:26,720
I hoped that one day

171
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,080
I'd become a hero
like General Xiao Zhongwu.

172
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,879
You wished to emulate Xiao Zhongwu?

173
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,000
Xiao Zhongwu was a traitor to Wei.

174
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,399
It was all due to his reckless ambition

175
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,799
and warmongering.

176
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,799
Soldiers wield swords

177
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,320
to guard the land

178
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,000
and its people.

179
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,440
General Xiao taught me those words.

180
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,320
I refuse to believe

181
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,720
he was a warmonger.

182
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,840
Tomorrow, I'll attend court

183
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,240
and demand justice for General Xiao.

184
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,720
Even at the cost of my military honors,

185
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,279
I won't hesitate.

186
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,399
(Wei's Imperial Palace)
(In Mingshui Battle,)

187
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:12,240
(Wei lost over 30,000 soldiers.)

188
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,559
Commander Xiao Zhongwu
bears full responsibility.

189
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,360
(Emperor Chengping of Wei)
The Xiaos shall bury him as a commoner

190
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:22,600
and be stripped of military command

191
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,399
as punishment.

192
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,072
Your Majesty,

193
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:29,879
my father

194
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:32,320
was no warmonger.

195
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,799
Our army had

196
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,960
ambushes set

197
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,840
throughout Mingshui.

198
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,120
Yet on the day of battle,

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,840
the Wutuo people

200
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,720
somehow destroyed
all ambush points beforehand.

201
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:45,120
There must have been
a leak of intelligence.

202
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,879
I implore Your Majesty
to reopen this case

203
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,919
to clear my father's name

204
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,200
and restore justice

205
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
for Xiao Army soldiers.

206
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,240
By imperial decree,

207
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:02,080
summon General Feihong, He Rufei.

208
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,879
I, He Rufei,
pay respects to Your Majesty.

209
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,879
Rise.

210
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,200
Thank you.

211
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,080
General He,

212
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,360
in Mingshui Battle,

213
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:39,759
was there more

214
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,919
to Xiao Army's defeat?

215
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:42,639
Your Majesty,

216
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,320
there was no more story

217
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,480
to Mingshui Battle.

218
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,879
If not for General Xiao's

219
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,120
reckless pursuit of glory

220
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,200
and direct confrontation with Wutuo,

221
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,559
coupled with his refusal

222
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,320
to request aid from our Fuyue Army,

223
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,879
how could the battle
have turned so tragic?

224
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,799
He Rufei!

225
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:03,879
General Fengyun,

226
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,559
I tried to reason with you.

227
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,679
Yet, to absolve your father's sins,

228
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,000
you twisted the truth

229
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,440
and made baseless accusations.

230
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,480
I mobilized troops immediately

231
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,159
upon receiving the distress message

232
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,720
without a moment's hesitation.

233
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,279
He Rufei,

234
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,720
after all these years apart,

235
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,559
why did you become so wretched?

236
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,720
You dare attempt

237
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,320
to plead for a sinner?

238
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,159
You're

239
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,080
dragging our entire family to graves.

240
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,120
- Father.
- (I've meticulously imitated)

241
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:50,879
(your handwriting
and behavioral patterns.)

242
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,600
(Imitating?)

243
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,840
(Since you're unwilling to swap identities,
we'll talk about it later.)

244
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,679
(You've sacrificed
a lot for your brother.)

245
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:57,600
(It's been tough.)

246
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,399
(Let your brother express
his gratitude to you)

247
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,960
(and have this cup of tea.)

248
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,320
General Fengyun
breached court etiquette.

249
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:25,799
But His Majesty acknowledges
the Xiao family's military merits.

250
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,840
As a warning, he shall be punished

251
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,399
with 20 strokes

252
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,080
and kneel outside the hall till dawn

253
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,799
to reflect on his transgressions.

254
00:13:51,771 --> 00:13:54,376
(Memorial Tablet of Mother, Song Wan;
Memorial Tablet of Father, Xiao Zhongwu)

255
00:14:04,412 --> 00:14:05,896
(People's Guardian of Loyalty and Valor)

256
00:14:21,115 --> 00:14:22,482
(People's Guardian of Loyalty and Valor)

257
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,519
Punishment carried out.

258
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,600
Your Majesty,

259
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,600
I admit fault.

260
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,679
I request to lead troops to Que City

261
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,679
to reclaim our lost territory

262
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,000
and atone for my sins.

263
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,559
Your Majesty,

264
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,759
I'll sign a military pledge.

265
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,879
If Que City isn't reclaimed,

266
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,279
I vow never to return.

267
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,879
General Fengyun,

268
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,480
(Xu Jingfu, Prime Minister of Wei)
His Majesty has granted your request.

269
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,320
Gratitude to Your Majesty.

270
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,440
However, Wei's soldiers

271
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,480
shall not be sent to futile deaths.

272
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,600
Xiao Jue,

273
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:55,240
the court won't provide any troops.

274
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,519
Recover the territory

275
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,200
through your own means.

276
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,399
I

277
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:06,639
accept the decree.

278
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,840
Thanks, Your Majesty.

279
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,879
(Even if at the cost of all,)

280
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,519
(I will clear my father's name.)

281
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:45,608
(Several days later)

282
00:16:50,651 --> 00:16:55,048
(Yuhua Temple)

283
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,759
Miss.

284
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,519
Miss.

285
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,480
Take a walk with me by the roses.

286
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:11,784
Okay.

287
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:16,319
Be careful.

288
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,359
There are steps ahead.

289
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,599
(59, 60,)

290
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,400
(61...)

291
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,240
You're so straightforward,

292
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,599
unlike the delicate noble ladies

293
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,519
visiting the temple.

294
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,160
Yixin,

295
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:46,440
if I turn right

296
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,000
and go forward,

297
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:48,960
will it lead

298
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,160
to the rear courtyard wall?

299
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,680
Yes, it'll be the rear wall.

300
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,119
Beyond lies the hidden path I use

301
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,000
to leave here.

302
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
Past the canyon crevice,

303
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,319
it'll be beyond Yuhua Temple.

304
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,240
Show me around.

305
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:03,816
Okay.

306
00:18:10,684 --> 00:18:13,256
(Ding Yi, He Rufei's guard)

307
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,319
Father showed mercy and spared her life

308
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,519
due to family ties.

309
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:21,160
But even blinded by poison,

310
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,519
she remains a threat.

311
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,119
I'll send her to Yuhua Temple first.

312
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
Watch her closely.

313
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,960
Spread that word

314
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,599
that Miss He's condition
has suddenly worsened.

315
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,799
Then...

316
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,000
I will handle it impeccably.

317
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,359
(From meditation room to bridge,)

318
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,680
(it takes 61 steps.)

319
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,720
(After the bridge)

320
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:58,200
(and seven more steps,)

321
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,319
(I'll reach the roses by the pond.)

322
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,720
(Then bypass the roses and turn right.)

323
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,000
(Did I miscalculate my stride today?)

324
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,680
(Or did I miscount?)

325
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:52,759
Who are you?

326
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,640
Forgive me, miss.

327
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,480
I am merely

328
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,720
a devotee visiting this temple.

329
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,759
No offense.

330
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,240
Yuhua Temple's back courtyard
lies in the northwest corner.

331
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,319
Devotees' meditation rooms

332
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,079
are in the eastern part.

333
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:10,599
It seems you think

334
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,279
that I harbor ill intentions.

335
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,799
If you truly wish to die,

336
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:17,400
why care about my potential harm?

337
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,160
(Wishing to die?)

338
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:21,759
Our parents gave us

339
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,000
our physical forms.

340
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,519
One more step and you'd enter the pond.

341
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:29,079
If you disrespect life so casually

342
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:31,799
and disregard
your parents' nurturing grace,

343
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,319
then proceed as you will.

344
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,119
I won't stop you.

345
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,000
Nurturing grace?

346
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,559
They denied me even the chance

347
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,319
to speak.

348
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,680
They blinded me and abandoned me here.

349
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,119
In that case,

350
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:50,480
my life

351
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,359
is now mine to command.

352
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,720
In desperation,

353
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:56,960
death

354
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,640
becomes easier than living.

355
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,839
If you're truly tough,

356
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,880
blindness matters not.

357
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,200
Even blind,

358
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,920
aim to be

359
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,119
the most special of all.

360
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,759
Give me your hand.

361
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,200
This osmanthus candy

362
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,039
is the last piece left in the world.

363
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,039
Though inedible now,

364
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,039
it remains sweet.

365
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,880
I won't know

366
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,000
until I taste it.

367
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:44,599
Though bitter at first taste,

368
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,880
its core holds enduring sweetness.

369
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Is the moon tonight

370
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,200
beautiful?

371
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,640
Bright moon like frost.

372
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,720
Gentle breeze like water.

373
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,559
The serene beauty is endless.

374
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:32,960
I moved the roses

375
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,720
to stage an accidental drowning

376
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,480
for Young Lady at Yuhua Temple.

377
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:38,880
But Young Lady

378
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:40,359
was pulled back by Xiao Jue

379
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:42,559
and avoided falling.

380
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,839
Why would Xiao Jue

381
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:44,759
appear there?

382
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:47,519
No matter who intervenes,

383
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,359
that woman cannot be saved.

384
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,480
Let her escape then

385
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,640
and die

386
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,720
on her way to appeal to the emperor.

387
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,519
(Beyond lies the hidden path I use)

388
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:17,440
(to leave here.)

389
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,680
(Past the canyon crevice,
it'll be beyond Yuhua Temple.)

390
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,559
Young Lady, let me send you
on your final journey.

391
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,160
In your next life,
avoid being born a He.

392
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,400
Your continued existence
remains a threat

393
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,359
to the He family.

394
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,119
A mere woman

395
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,960
daring to seek military glory?

396
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:54,119
Preposterous delusions!

397
00:25:35,323 --> 00:25:39,304
(One month later)

398
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,319
(I can see again.)

399
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,000
(Where am I?)

400
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,279
(Didn't I die?)

401
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:51,000
With great effort,

402
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,559
I saved you

403
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,000
and restored your vision.

404
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,079
Why do you

405
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:54,799
keep moving?

406
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,680
Master.

407
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,080
(Liu Buwang, He Yan's master)

408
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:02,880
Last I saw you so weakened

409
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:04,640
was when I rescued you

410
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,680
from that mountain of corpses

411
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,160
on the battlefield.

412
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:09,279
Why ended up

413
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:10,160
like that again?

414
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,000
I thought

415
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,279
I could survive.

416
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,039
Unexpectedly,

417
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,599
I misjudged human nature.

418
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,039
They didn't just silence me

419
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:29,880
but sought to ensure

420
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,480
I'd never speak again.

421
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,279
Your family

422
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,839
has mastered the art

423
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,799
of deception to perfection.

424
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,440
Master,

425
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,799
news was scarce at Yuhua Temple.

426
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:51,960
Do you know

427
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,480
how the Xiao family fares now?

428
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,119
Has General Xiao's name

429
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:56,240
been cleared?

430
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,680
The entire court

431
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,680
condemned Xiao Zhongwu.

432
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,920
To stabilize the court, His Majesty

433
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,119
declared him guilty soon

434
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:06,559
and almost

435
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,680
took away Xiao Army's
conscription rights.

436
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
How could this happen?

437
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,119
Didn't His Majesty investigate?

438
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,640
General Fengyun,

439
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,319
as fellow generals,

440
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,720
I deeply respect General Xiao.

441
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:20,160
But in matters of righteousness,

442
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,599
we must not speak falsely.

443
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,160
Righteousness?

444
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,759
Does your righteousness

445
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:26,960
mean delaying reinforcements

446
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,200
and letting my father,

447
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,759
along with 30,000 Xiao soldiers,

448
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:33,079
die in vain?

449
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:36,599
I immediately dispatched troops

450
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:38,359
upon receiving the distress call,

451
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,960
without any delay.

452
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,680
Had I not turned the tide,

453
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,079
Wutuo's cavalry

454
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,519
would have reached here long ago.

455
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,599
As a witness, General Feihong testified

456
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,839
before His Majesty

457
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,279
and firmly insisted

458
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:54,559
on Xiao Zhongwu's guilt.

459
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:57,119
With such crucial witnesses present,

460
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,920
they didn't look further.

461
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:13,599
He Rufei,

462
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,319
it was you

463
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,640
who delayed reinforcement

464
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,799
and caused my father

465
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,160
and the Xiao Army troops

466
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,680
to perish tragically!

467
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,480
Childhood classmates first,

468
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,160
and then

469
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,039
frontier commanders.

470
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,680
He Rufei,

471
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:39,039
after all these years apart,

472
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,839
why did you become so wretched?

473
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,079
(With my mask off)

474
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,759
(and my ties with the He family cut,)

475
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,759
(from now on,)

476
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,720
(I am simply He Yan.)

477
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,559
(In this vast world,)

478
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:39,000
(I'm no longer anyone's substitute.)

479
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,119
(He Rufei stole my title
as General Feihong,)

480
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,759
(tried to kill me, and ruined my name.)

481
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:49,200
(I won't let him off.)

482
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,359
(I will return to the army)

483
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
(and honorably)

484
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,119
(reclaim everything that's mine.)

485
00:31:10,588 --> 00:31:15,752
(Yezhou Garrison)

486
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,039
Thank you.
