1
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,199
(After being a substitute for so long,)

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,480
(will I forget)

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,719
(who I truly am?)

4
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,000
(They call me He Rufei.)

5
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:28,920
Kneel.

6
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:31,240
(The eldest son of the He family.)

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,759
(Since childhood,)

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,000
(I was disguised as a boy.)

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,039
(Visionary Foresight)

10
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,640
(I've always had to wear a mask.)

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,359
(They said,)

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,079
("live")

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,176
("without recognition")

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:45,840
("and die")

15
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,640
("without a trace.")

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:53,840
(I hated it.)

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,400
Remember.

18
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,560
(Yet found solace too.)

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,599
(This cold mask)

20
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:01,280
(smothered my identity)

21
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,959
(yet forged my purpose.)

22
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,120
(Amidst the smoke of war)

23
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,840
(and seas of blood,)

24
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:13,000
(I forgot life and death)

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,040
(and stopped wondering)

26
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,799
(who I am)

27
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,640
(beneath the mask.)

28
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,519
(From a nameless foot soldier,)

29
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:25,519
(I fought)

30
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,439
(to become
the invincible General Feihong.)

31
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,200
(But in the end,)

32
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,319
(who is General Feihong?)

33
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,000
(Who)

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,719
(am I?)

35

=Legend of The Female General=

56

=Episode 1=

57
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,719
(In the 20th year
of Wei's Qingyuan era,)

58
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,639
(Battlefield of Mingshui)
(Wutuo invaded Wei again.)

59
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,919
(Emperor Chengping)

60
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,759
(ordered General Xiao Zhongwu,)

61
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,759
(Xiao Army's commander)

62
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,520
(who beat Wutuo five years ago,)

63
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,120
(Xiao Zhongwu, Xiao Army's Commander)
(to march to battle.)

64
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,759
(But at Mingshui's final battle,)

65
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,039
(30,000 Xiao troops)

66
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,919
(fell into an ambush.)

67
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,479
Xiao Zhongwu,

68
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,960
He Rufei's Fuyue Army

69
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,080
won't be coming.

70
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,599
Surrender,

71
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,280
and we'll spare you.

72
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,759
He Rufei

73
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,080
will come without fail!

74
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,160
Wei soldiers

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,839
choose death over surrender.

76
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,000
Charge!

77
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,040
General Xiao!

78
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:41,680
General Xiao!

79
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,959
General Xiao!

80
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:55,959
Father!

81
00:05:04,548 --> 00:05:06,839
(Xiao Jue, styled Huaijin,
General Fengyun)

82
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,879
He Rufei,

83
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:09,279
(General Feihong of Wei)

84
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,240
Huayuan is less than a hundred li
from Mingshui.

85
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,879
Why has your reinforcement
arrived so late?

86
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,639
A rope saws wood.

87
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:26,959
Water penetrates stones.

88
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,639
One day,

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,279
you two will become

90
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,120
Wei's Twin Stars.

91
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,720
With joint forces,

92
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,120
you shall wield the swords
to guard our land

93
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,480
and its people.

94
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,800
You are unworthy

95
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:53,000
of the Qinglang Sword
my father entrusted to you.

96
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,480
(Yaojing City)
General Feihong's returned triumphantly!

97
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,759
General Feihong!

98
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,279
Welcome, General Feihong!

99
00:06:10,352 --> 00:06:20,304
(General Feihong's Mansion)

100
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:46,480
Young Master,

101
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,240
the Master awaits you in his study.

102
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,560
Ermao.

103
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,000
Madam,

104
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,360
now that you're here,

105
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,560
visit the Young Lady.

106
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,519
Watch your tongue.

107
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,759
There is only the Young Master.

108
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,360
The Young Lady...

109
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,984
(Tang Jia, He Yan's mother)

110
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,439
She's recuperating at Yuhua Temple.

111
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:36,816
Sit.

112
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,720
Yan,

113
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,519
you've been away for years,

114
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,519
(He Yuansheng, He Yan's father)
enduring military hardships.

115
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,839
It must have been hard.

116
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,480
Father,

117
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:52,759
it's not hard at all.

118
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,519
Honoring our family

119
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:55,720
fills me with joy.

120
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,328
Yan,

121
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm glad you're home.

122
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,519
For a young lady,

123
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,600
to wield weapons

124
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,920
is improper.

125
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,199
Honoring the family

126
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,040
should be men's duty.

127
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,800
Now that you're back,

128
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,800
it's time to embrace your true identity

129
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:12,720
as a woman.

130
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
About our family's title,

131
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,439
you don't need to worry.

132
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,360
I have a solution.

133
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,519
A solution?

134
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,279
What solution?

135
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,399
You've sacrificed

136
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,559
for our family for years.

137
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:24,919
It's been tough for you.

138
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,799
From now on,

139
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,519
let me handle these matters.

140
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,200
This is

141
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,799
your brother you never met,

142
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,559
(He Rufei, He Yan's elder brother)
He Rufei.

143
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,960
When you came

144
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,360
with your mother at three,

145
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,639
due to his congenital frailty,

146
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,919
he had been recuperating
at Yuhua Temple.

147
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,360
That's why you had to replace him.

148
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,799
Now

149
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,320
your brother has fully recovered

150
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,200
and returned.

151
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:51,960
Both of you

152
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,720
should return to your proper places.

153
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,960
Our family's act

154
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,600
of replacing a son

155
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,440
with a daughter

156
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,360
can then be quietly erased.

157
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,000
Father,

158
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,519
is this your solution?

159
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,080
Yan,

160
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,159
you must consider
our family's interests.

161
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,279
Our family

162
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,519
is a pillar of Confucian academia

163
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:18,799
and a leader in literary.

164
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,840
Now, abandoning culture
for martial pursuits,

165
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,919
- we...
- Father.

166
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,559
It was precisely to not disappoint you

167
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,720
and to guard

168
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,759
our family's honor

169
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,320
that I strove to achieve military glory.

170
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,720
I hoped that one day

171
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,080
I'd become a hero
like General Xiao Zhongwu.

172
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,879
You wished to emulate Xiao Zhongwu?

173
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,000
Xiao Zhongwu was a traitor to Wei.

174
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,399
It was all due to his reckless ambition

175
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,799
and warmongering.

176
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,799
Soldiers wield swords

177
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,320
to guard the land

178
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,000
and its people.

179
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,440
General Xiao taught me those words.

180
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,320
I refuse to believe

181
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,720
he was a warmonger.

182
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:57,840
Tomorrow, I'll attend court

183
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,240
and demand justice for General Xiao.

184
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,720
Even at the cost of my military honors,

185
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,279
I won't hesitate.

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,399
(Wei's Imperial Palace)
(In Mingshui Battle,)

187
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,240
(Wei lost over 30,000 soldiers.)

188
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,559
Commander Xiao Zhongwu
bears full responsibility.

189
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:24,360
(Emperor Chengping of Wei)
The Xiaos shall bury him as a commoner

190
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:27,600
and be stripped of military command

191
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,399
as punishment.

192
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,072
Your Majesty,

193
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:34,879
my father

194
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,320
was no warmonger.

195
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,799
Our army had

196
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,960
ambushes set

197
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,840
throughout Mingshui.

198
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,120
Yet on the day of battle,

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,840
the Wutuo people

200
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,720
somehow destroyed
all ambush points beforehand.

201
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,120
There must have been
a leak of intelligence.

202
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,879
I implore Your Majesty
to reopen this case

203
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,919
to clear my father's name

204
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:57,200
and restore justice

205
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
for Xiao Army soldiers.

206
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,240
By imperial decree,

207
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:07,080
summon General Feihong, He Rufei.

208
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,879
I, He Rufei,
pay respects to Your Majesty.

209
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:36,879
Rise.

210
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,200
Thank you.

211
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,080
General He,

212
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,360
in Mingshui Battle,

213
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,759
was there more

214
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,919
to Xiao Army's defeat?

215
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:47,639
Your Majesty,

216
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,320
there was no more story

217
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,480
to Mingshui Battle.

218
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,879
If not for General Xiao's

219
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,120
reckless pursuit of glory

220
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,200
and direct confrontation with Wutuo,

221
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,559
coupled with his refusal

222
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,320
to request aid from our Fuyue Army,

223
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,879
how could the battle
have turned so tragic?

224
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,799
He Rufei!

225
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:08,879
General Fengyun,

226
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,559
I tried to reason with you.

227
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,679
Yet, to absolve your father's sins,

228
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,000
you twisted the truth

229
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,440
and made baseless accusations.

230
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:17,480
I mobilized troops immediately

231
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,159
upon receiving the distress message

232
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,720
without a moment's hesitation.

233
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,279
He Rufei,

234
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,720
after all these years apart,

235
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,559
why did you become so wretched?

236
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,720
You dare attempt

237
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,320
to plead for a sinner?

238
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:50,159
You're

239
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,080
dragging our entire family to graves.

240
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,120
- Father.
- (I've meticulously imitated)

241
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,879
(your handwriting
and behavioral patterns.)

242
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,600
(Imitating?)

243
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,840
(Since you're unwilling to swap identities,
we'll talk about it later.)

244
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,679
(You've sacrificed
a lot for your brother.)

245
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:02,600
(It's been tough.)

246
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,399
(Let your brother express
his gratitude to you)

247
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,960
(and have this cup of tea.)

248
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,320
General Fengyun
breached court etiquette.

249
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,799
But His Majesty acknowledges
the Xiao family's military merits.

250
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,840
As a warning, he shall be punished

251
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,399
with 20 strokes

252
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,080
and kneel outside the hall till dawn

253
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,799
to reflect on his transgressions.

254
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:59,376
(Memorial Tablet of Mother, Song Wan;
Memorial Tablet of Father, Xiao Zhongwu)

255
00:14:09,412 --> 00:14:10,896
(People's Guardian of Loyalty and Valor)

256
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,482
(People's Guardian of Loyalty and Valor)

257
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,519
Punishment carried out.

258
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,600
Your Majesty,

259
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,600
I admit fault.

260
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,679
I request to lead troops to Que City

261
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,679
to reclaim our lost territory

262
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,000
and atone for my sins.

263
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,559
Your Majesty,

264
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:15,759
I'll sign a military pledge.

265
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,879
If Que City isn't reclaimed,

266
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,279
I vow never to return.

267
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,879
General Fengyun,

268
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,480
(Xu Jingfu, Prime Minister of Wei)
His Majesty has granted your request.

269
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,320
Gratitude to Your Majesty.

270
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,440
However, Wei's soldiers

271
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,480
shall not be sent to futile deaths.

272
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,600
Xiao Jue,

273
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,240
the court won't provide any troops.

274
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,519
Recover the territory

275
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,200
through your own means.

276
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,399
I

277
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:11,639
accept the decree.

278
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,840
Thanks, Your Majesty.

279
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,879
(Even if at the cost of all,)

280
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,519
(I will clear my father's name.)

281
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:50,608
(Several days later)

282
00:16:55,651 --> 00:17:00,048
(Yuhua Temple)

283
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:09,759
Miss.

284
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,519
Miss.

285
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,480
Take a walk with me by the roses.

286
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:16,784
Okay.

287
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,319
Be careful.

288
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,359
There are steps ahead.

289
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:35,599
(59, 60,)

290
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,400
(61...)

291
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,240
You're so straightforward,

292
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,599
unlike the delicate noble ladies

293
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,519
visiting the temple.

294
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,160
Yixin,

295
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:51,440
if I turn right

296
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,000
and go forward,

297
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:53,960
will it lead

298
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,160
to the rear courtyard wall?

299
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,680
Yes, it'll be the rear wall.

300
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,119
Beyond lies the hidden path I use

301
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:01,000
to leave here.

302
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,680
Past the canyon crevice,

303
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,319
it'll be beyond Yuhua Temple.

304
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,240
Show me around.

305
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:08,816
Okay.

306
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:18,256
(Ding Yi, He Rufei's guard)

307
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,319
Father showed mercy and spared her life

308
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,519
due to family ties.

309
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:26,160
But even blinded by poison,

310
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,519
she remains a threat.

311
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,119
I'll send her to Yuhua Temple first.

312
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
Watch her closely.

313
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:34,960
Spread that word

314
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,599
that Miss He's condition
has suddenly worsened.

315
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,799
Then...

316
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,000
I will handle it impeccably.

317
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,359
(From meditation room to bridge,)

318
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,680
(it takes 61 steps.)

319
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,720
(After the bridge)

320
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,200
(and seven more steps,)

321
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,319
(I'll reach the roses by the pond.)

322
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,720
(Then bypass the roses and turn right.)

323
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,000
(Did I miscalculate my stride today?)

324
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,680
(Or did I miscount?)

325
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:57,759
Who are you?

326
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,640
Forgive me, miss.

327
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,480
I am merely

328
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,720
a devotee visiting this temple.

329
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,759
No offense.

330
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,240
Yuhua Temple's back courtyard
lies in the northwest corner.

331
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,319
Devotees' meditation rooms

332
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,079
are in the eastern part.

333
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,599
It seems you think

334
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,279
that I harbor ill intentions.

335
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,799
If you truly wish to die,

336
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,400
why care about my potential harm?

337
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,160
(Wishing to die?)

338
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:26,759
Our parents gave us

339
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,000
our physical forms.

340
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:31,519
One more step and you'd enter the pond.

341
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,079
If you disrespect life so casually

342
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,799
and disregard
your parents' nurturing grace,

343
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,319
then proceed as you will.

344
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,119
I won't stop you.

345
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,000
Nurturing grace?

346
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,559
They denied me even the chance

347
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,319
to speak.

348
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,680
They blinded me and abandoned me here.

349
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,119
In that case,

350
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:55,480
my life

351
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,359
is now mine to command.

352
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
In desperation,

353
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:01,960
death

354
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,640
becomes easier than living.

355
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,839
If you're truly tough,

356
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,880
blindness matters not.

357
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,200
Even blind,

358
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,920
aim to be

359
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,119
the most special of all.

360
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,759
Give me your hand.

361
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,200
This osmanthus candy

362
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,039
is the last piece left in the world.

363
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,039
Though inedible now,

364
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,039
it remains sweet.

365
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,880
I won't know

366
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,000
until I taste it.

367
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:49,599
Though bitter at first taste,

368
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,880
its core holds enduring sweetness.

369
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,400
Is the moon tonight

370
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,200
beautiful?

371
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,640
Bright moon like frost.

372
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,720
Gentle breeze like water.

373
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,559
The serene beauty is endless.

374
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:37,960
I moved the roses

375
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,720
to stage an accidental drowning

376
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,480
for Young Lady at Yuhua Temple.

377
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:43,880
But Young Lady

378
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,359
was pulled back by Xiao Jue

379
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:47,559
and avoided falling.

380
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,839
Why would Xiao Jue

381
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:49,759
appear there?

382
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:52,519
No matter who intervenes,

383
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,359
that woman cannot be saved.

384
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:01,480
Let her escape then

385
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,640
and die

386
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,720
on her way to appeal to the emperor.

387
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:21,519
(Beyond lies the hidden path I use)

388
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:22,440
(to leave here.)

389
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,680
(Past the canyon crevice,
it'll be beyond Yuhua Temple.)

390
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:01,559
Young Lady, let me send you
on your final journey.

391
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,160
In your next life,
avoid being born a He.

392
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,400
Your continued existence
remains a threat

393
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,359
to the He family.

394
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,119
A mere woman

395
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,960
daring to seek military glory?

396
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,119
Preposterous delusions!

397
00:25:40,323 --> 00:25:44,304
(One month later)

398
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,319
(I can see again.)

399
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,000
(Where am I?)

400
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,279
(Didn't I die?)

401
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,000
With great effort,

402
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,559
I saved you

403
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,000
and restored your vision.

404
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,079
Why do you

405
00:26:59,119 --> 00:26:59,799
keep moving?

406
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,680
Master.

407
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:04,080
(Liu Buwang, He Yan's master)

408
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,880
Last I saw you so weakened

409
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:09,640
was when I rescued you

410
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,680
from that mountain of corpses

411
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:13,160
on the battlefield.

412
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,279
Why ended up

413
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:15,160
like that again?

414
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,000
I thought

415
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,279
I could survive.

416
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,039
Unexpectedly,

417
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,599
I misjudged human nature.

418
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,039
They didn't just silence me

419
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:34,880
but sought to ensure

420
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,480
I'd never speak again.

421
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,279
Your family

422
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,839
has mastered the art

423
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,799
of deception to perfection.

424
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,440
Master,

425
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,799
news was scarce at Yuhua Temple.

426
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:56,960
Do you know

427
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,480
how the Xiao family fares now?

428
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,119
Has General Xiao's name

429
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,240
been cleared?

430
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,680
The entire court

431
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,680
condemned Xiao Zhongwu.

432
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:07,920
To stabilize the court, His Majesty

433
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,119
declared him guilty soon

434
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:11,559
and almost

435
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,680
took away Xiao Army's
conscription rights.

436
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
How could this happen?

437
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,119
Didn't His Majesty investigate?

438
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,640
General Fengyun,

439
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,319
as fellow generals,

440
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,720
I deeply respect General Xiao.

441
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:25,160
But in matters of righteousness,

442
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,599
we must not speak falsely.

443
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:29,160
Righteousness?

444
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,759
Does your righteousness

445
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:31,960
mean delaying reinforcements

446
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,200
and letting my father,

447
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,759
along with 30,000 Xiao soldiers,

448
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:38,079
die in vain?

449
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,599
I immediately dispatched troops

450
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,359
upon receiving the distress call,

451
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,960
without any delay.

452
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,680
Had I not turned the tide,

453
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,079
Wutuo's cavalry

454
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,519
would have reached here long ago.

455
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:55,599
As a witness, General Feihong testified

456
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,839
before His Majesty

457
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,279
and firmly insisted

458
00:28:58,359 --> 00:28:59,559
on Xiao Zhongwu's guilt.

459
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:02,119
With such crucial witnesses present,

460
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,920
they didn't look further.

461
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,599
He Rufei,

462
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,319
it was you

463
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,640
who delayed reinforcement

464
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:25,799
and caused my father

465
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,160
and the Xiao Army troops

466
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,680
to perish tragically!

467
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,480
Childhood classmates first,

468
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:35,160
and then

469
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,039
frontier commanders.

470
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,680
He Rufei,

471
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:44,039
after all these years apart,

472
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,839
why did you become so wretched?

473
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,079
(With my mask off)

474
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,759
(and my ties with the He family cut,)

475
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,759
(from now on,)

476
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,720
(I am simply He Yan.)

477
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,559
(In this vast world,)

478
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:44,000
(I'm no longer anyone's substitute.)

479
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,119
(He Rufei stole my title
as General Feihong,)

480
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,759
(tried to kill me, and ruined my name.)

481
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:54,200
(I won't let him off.)

482
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,359
(I will return to the army)

483
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
(and honorably)

484
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,119
(reclaim everything that's mine.)

485
00:31:15,588 --> 00:31:20,752
(Yezhou Garrison)

486
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,039
Thank you.
