1
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,199
(After being a substitute for so long,)

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,480
(will I forget)

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,719
(who I truly am?)

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,000
(They call me He Rufei.)

5
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:33,920
Kneel.

6
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,240
(The eldest son of the He family.)

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,759
(Since childhood,)

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,000
(I was disguised as a boy.)

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,039
(Visionary Foresight)

10
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,640
(I've always had to wear a mask.)

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,359
(They said,)

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,079
("live")

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,176
("without recognition")

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:50,840
("and die")

15
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:53,640
("without a trace.")

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:58,840
(I hated it.)

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,400
Remember.

18
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:01,560
(Yet found solace too.)

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,599
(This cold mask)

20
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,280
(smothered my identity)

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,959
(yet forged my purpose.)

22
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:14,120
(Amidst the smoke of war)

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,840
(and seas of blood,)

24
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,000
(I forgot life and death)

25
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,040
(and stopped wondering)

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,799
(who I am)

27
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,640
(beneath the mask.)

28
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,519
(From a nameless foot soldier,)

29
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:30,519
(I fought)

30
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:32,439
(to become
the invincible General Feihong.)

31
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,200
(But in the end,)

32
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,319
(who is General Feihong?)

33
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,000
(Who)

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,719
(am I?)

56

=Episode 1=

57
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,719
(In the 20th year
of Wei's Qingyuan era,)

58
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,639
(Battlefield of Mingshui)
(Wutuo invaded Wei again.)

59
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,919
(Emperor Chengping)

60
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,759
(ordered General Xiao Zhongwu,)

61
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,759
(Xiao Army's commander)

62
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,520
(who beat Wutuo five years ago,)

63
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,120
(Xiao Zhongwu, Xiao Army's Commander)
(to march to battle.)

64
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,759
(But at Mingshui's final battle,)

65
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,039
(30,000 Xiao troops)

66
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,919
(fell into an ambush.)

67
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,479
Xiao Zhongwu,

68
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,960
He Rufei's Fuyue Army

69
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,080
won't be coming.

70
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,599
Surrender,

71
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,280
and we'll spare you.

72
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,759
He Rufei

73
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,080
will come without fail!

74
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:13,160
Wei soldiers

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,839
choose death over surrender.

76
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,000
Charge!

77
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,040
General Xiao!

78
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,680
General Xiao!

79
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,959
General Xiao!

80
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:00,959
Father!

81
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:11,839
(Xiao Jue, styled Huaijin,
General Fengyun)

82
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:12,879
He Rufei,

83
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:14,279
(General Feihong of Wei)

84
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,240
Huayuan is less than a hundred li
from Mingshui.

85
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,879
Why has your reinforcement
arrived so late?

86
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,639
A rope saws wood.

87
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,959
Water penetrates stones.

88
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,639
One day,

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,279
you two will become

90
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,120
Wei's Twin Stars.

91
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,720
With joint forces,

92
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,120
you shall wield the swords
to guard our land

93
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,480
and its people.

94
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,800
You are unworthy

95
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,000
of the Qinglang Sword
my father entrusted to you.

96
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,480
(Yaojing City)
General Feihong's returned triumphantly!

97
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,759
General Feihong!

98
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,279
Welcome, General Feihong!

99
00:06:15,352 --> 00:06:25,304
(General Feihong's Mansion)

100
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,480
Young Master,

101
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,240
the Master awaits you in his study.

102
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,560
Ermao.

103
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,000
Madam,

104
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,360
now that you're here,

105
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,560
visit the Young Lady.

106
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,519
Watch your tongue.

107
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,759
There is only the Young Master.

108
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,360
The Young Lady...

109
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,984
(Tang Jia, He Yan's mother)

110
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,439
She's recuperating at Yuhua Temple.

111
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:41,816
Sit.

112
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,720
Yan,

113
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,519
you've been away for years,

114
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,519
(He Yuansheng, He Yan's father)
enduring military hardships.

115
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,839
It must have been hard.

116
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,480
Father,

117
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:57,759
it's not hard at all.

118
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,519
Honoring our family

119
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,720
fills me with joy.

120
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,328
Yan,

121
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm glad you're home.

122
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,519
For a young lady,

123
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,600
to wield weapons

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,920
is improper.

125
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,199
Honoring the family

126
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,040
should be men's duty.

127
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,800
Now that you're back,

128
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,800
it's time to embrace your true identity

129
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,720
as a woman.

130
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
About our family's title,

131
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,439
you don't need to worry.

132
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,360
I have a solution.

133
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,519
A solution?

134
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,279
What solution?

135
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,399
You've sacrificed

136
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,559
for our family for years.

137
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:29,919
It's been tough for you.

138
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,799
From now on,

139
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,519
let me handle these matters.

140
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,200
This is

141
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,799
your brother you never met,

142
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,559
(He Rufei, He Yan's elder brother)
He Rufei.

143
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,960
When you came

144
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,360
with your mother at three,

145
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,639
due to his congenital frailty,

146
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,919
he had been recuperating
at Yuhua Temple.

147
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
That's why you had to replace him.

148
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,799
Now

149
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,320
your brother has fully recovered

150
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,200
and returned.

151
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:56,960
Both of you

152
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,720
should return to your proper places.

153
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,960
Our family's act

154
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,600
of replacing a son

155
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:02,440
with a daughter

156
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,360
can then be quietly erased.

157
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,000
Father,

158
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,519
is this your solution?

159
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,080
Yan,

160
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,159
you must consider
our family's interests.

161
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,279
Our family

162
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,519
is a pillar of Confucian academia

163
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,799
and a leader in literary.

164
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,840
Now, abandoning culture
for martial pursuits,

165
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,919
- we...
- Father.

166
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,559
It was precisely to not disappoint you

167
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,720
and to guard

168
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,759
our family's honor

169
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,320
that I strove to achieve military glory.

170
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:36,720
I hoped that one day

171
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,080
I'd become a hero
like General Xiao Zhongwu.

172
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,879
You wished to emulate Xiao Zhongwu?

173
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,000
Xiao Zhongwu was a traitor to Wei.

174
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,399
It was all due to his reckless ambition

175
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,799
and warmongering.

176
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,799
Soldiers wield swords

177
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,320
to guard the land

178
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,000
and its people.

179
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,440
General Xiao taught me those words.

180
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,320
I refuse to believe

181
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,720
he was a warmonger.

182
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:02,840
Tomorrow, I'll attend court

183
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,240
and demand justice for General Xiao.

184
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,720
Even at the cost of my military honors,

185
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,279
I won't hesitate.

186
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,399
(Wei's Imperial Palace)
(In Mingshui Battle,)

187
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:22,240
(Wei lost over 30,000 soldiers.)

188
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,559
Commander Xiao Zhongwu
bears full responsibility.

189
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,360
(Emperor Chengping of Wei)
The Xiaos shall bury him as a commoner

190
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,600
and be stripped of military command

191
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,399
as punishment.

192
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,072
Your Majesty,

193
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:39,879
my father

194
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,320
was no warmonger.

195
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,799
Our army had

196
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,960
ambushes set

197
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,840
throughout Mingshui.

198
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,120
Yet on the day of battle,

199
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,840
the Wutuo people

200
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,720
somehow destroyed
all ambush points beforehand.

201
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,120
There must have been
a leak of intelligence.

202
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,879
I implore Your Majesty
to reopen this case

203
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:59,919
to clear my father's name

204
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,200
and restore justice

205
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
for Xiao Army soldiers.

206
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:07,240
By imperial decree,

207
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:12,080
summon General Feihong, He Rufei.

208
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,879
I, He Rufei,
pay respects to Your Majesty.

209
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,879
Rise.

210
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,200
Thank you.

211
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,080
General He,

212
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,360
in Mingshui Battle,

213
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:49,759
was there more

214
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,919
to Xiao Army's defeat?

215
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:52,639
Your Majesty,

216
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,320
there was no more story

217
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,480
to Mingshui Battle.

218
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,879
If not for General Xiao's

219
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,120
reckless pursuit of glory

220
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,200
and direct confrontation with Wutuo,

221
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,559
coupled with his refusal

222
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,320
to request aid from our Fuyue Army,

223
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,879
how could the battle
have turned so tragic?

224
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,799
He Rufei!

225
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:13,879
General Fengyun,

226
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,559
I tried to reason with you.

227
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,679
Yet, to absolve your father's sins,

228
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,000
you twisted the truth

229
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,440
and made baseless accusations.

230
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,480
I mobilized troops immediately

231
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,159
upon receiving the distress message

232
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,720
without a moment's hesitation.

233
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,279
He Rufei,

234
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,720
after all these years apart,

235
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,559
why did you become so wretched?

236
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,720
You dare attempt

237
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,320
to plead for a sinner?

238
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,159
You're

239
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,080
dragging our entire family to graves.

240
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,120
- Father.
- (I've meticulously imitated)

241
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,879
(your handwriting
and behavioral patterns.)

242
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,600
(Imitating?)

243
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,840
(Since you're unwilling to swap identities,
we'll talk about it later.)

244
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:06,679
(You've sacrificed
a lot for your brother.)

245
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:07,600
(It's been tough.)

246
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,399
(Let your brother express
his gratitude to you)

247
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,960
(and have this cup of tea.)

248
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,320
General Fengyun
breached court etiquette.

249
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:35,799
But His Majesty acknowledges
the Xiao family's military merits.

250
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,840
As a warning, he shall be punished

251
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,399
with 20 strokes

252
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,080
and kneel outside the hall till dawn

253
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,799
to reflect on his transgressions.

254
00:14:01,771 --> 00:14:04,376
(Memorial Tablet of Mother, Song Wan;
Memorial Tablet of Father, Xiao Zhongwu)

255
00:14:14,412 --> 00:14:15,896
(People's Guardian of Loyalty and Valor)

256
00:14:31,115 --> 00:14:32,482
(People's Guardian of Loyalty and Valor)

257
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:38,519
Punishment carried out.

258
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,600
Your Majesty,

259
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,600
I admit fault.

260
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,679
I request to lead troops to Que City

261
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,679
to reclaim our lost territory

262
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,000
and atone for my sins.

263
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,559
Your Majesty,

264
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:20,759
I'll sign a military pledge.

265
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,879
If Que City isn't reclaimed,

266
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,279
I vow never to return.

267
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,879
General Fengyun,

268
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,480
(Xu Jingfu, Prime Minister of Wei)
His Majesty has granted your request.

269
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:52,320
Gratitude to Your Majesty.

270
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,440
However, Wei's soldiers

271
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,480
shall not be sent to futile deaths.

272
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,600
Xiao Jue,

273
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:05,240
the court won't provide any troops.

274
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,519
Recover the territory

275
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,200
through your own means.

276
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,399
I

277
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:16,639
accept the decree.

278
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,840
Thanks, Your Majesty.

279
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,879
(Even if at the cost of all,)

280
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:46,519
(I will clear my father's name.)

281
00:16:50,956 --> 00:16:55,608
(Several days later)

282
00:17:00,651 --> 00:17:05,048
(Yuhua Temple)

283
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,759
Miss.

284
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,519
Miss.

285
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,480
Take a walk with me by the roses.

286
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,784
Okay.

287
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:26,319
Be careful.

288
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,359
There are steps ahead.

289
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,599
(59, 60,)

290
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,400
(61...)

291
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,240
You're so straightforward,

292
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,599
unlike the delicate noble ladies

293
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,519
visiting the temple.

294
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,160
Yixin,

295
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:56,440
if I turn right

296
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,000
and go forward,

297
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:58,960
will it lead

298
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,160
to the rear courtyard wall?

299
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,680
Yes, it'll be the rear wall.

300
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,119
Beyond lies the hidden path I use

301
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,000
to leave here.

302
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
Past the canyon crevice,

303
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,319
it'll be beyond Yuhua Temple.

304
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,240
Show me around.

305
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,816
Okay.

306
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:23,256
(Ding Yi, He Rufei's guard)

307
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,319
Father showed mercy and spared her life

308
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,519
due to family ties.

309
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:31,160
But even blinded by poison,

310
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,519
she remains a threat.

311
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,119
I'll send her to Yuhua Temple first.

312
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,680
Watch her closely.

313
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,960
Spread that word

314
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,599
that Miss He's condition
has suddenly worsened.

315
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,799
Then...

316
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,000
I will handle it impeccably.

317
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,359
(From meditation room to bridge,)

318
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,680
(it takes 61 steps.)

319
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,720
(After the bridge)

320
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,200
(and seven more steps,)

321
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,319
(I'll reach the roses by the pond.)

322
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,720
(Then bypass the roses and turn right.)

323
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,000
(Did I miscalculate my stride today?)

324
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,680
(Or did I miscount?)

325
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,759
Who are you?

326
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,640
Forgive me, miss.

327
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,480
I am merely

328
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,720
a devotee visiting this temple.

329
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,759
No offense.

330
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,240
Yuhua Temple's back courtyard
lies in the northwest corner.

331
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,319
Devotees' meditation rooms

332
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:17,079
are in the eastern part.

333
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,599
It seems you think

334
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,279
that I harbor ill intentions.

335
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,799
If you truly wish to die,

336
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,400
why care about my potential harm?

337
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:30,160
(Wishing to die?)

338
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:31,759
Our parents gave us

339
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,000
our physical forms.

340
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,519
One more step and you'd enter the pond.

341
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:39,079
If you disrespect life so casually

342
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,799
and disregard
your parents' nurturing grace,

343
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,319
then proceed as you will.

344
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,119
I won't stop you.

345
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,000
Nurturing grace?

346
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,559
They denied me even the chance

347
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,319
to speak.

348
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:55,680
They blinded me and abandoned me here.

349
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,119
In that case,

350
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,480
my life

351
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,359
is now mine to command.

352
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,720
In desperation,

353
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:06,960
death

354
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,640
becomes easier than living.

355
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,839
If you're truly tough,

356
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,880
blindness matters not.

357
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,200
Even blind,

358
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,920
aim to be

359
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,119
the most special of all.

360
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,759
Give me your hand.

361
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,200
This osmanthus candy

362
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,039
is the last piece left in the world.

363
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,039
Though inedible now,

364
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,039
it remains sweet.

365
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,880
I won't know

366
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,000
until I taste it.

367
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,599
Though bitter at first taste,

368
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,880
its core holds enduring sweetness.

369
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Is the moon tonight

370
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,200
beautiful?

371
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,640
Bright moon like frost.

372
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,720
Gentle breeze like water.

373
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,559
The serene beauty is endless.

374
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:42,960
I moved the roses

375
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,720
to stage an accidental drowning

376
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,480
for Young Lady at Yuhua Temple.

377
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:48,880
But Young Lady

378
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:50,359
was pulled back by Xiao Jue

379
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:52,559
and avoided falling.

380
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,839
Why would Xiao Jue

381
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:54,759
appear there?

382
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,519
No matter who intervenes,

383
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,359
that woman cannot be saved.

384
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,480
Let her escape then

385
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,640
and die

386
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,720
on her way to appeal to the emperor.

387
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:26,519
(Beyond lies the hidden path I use)

388
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:27,440
(to leave here.)

389
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,680
(Past the canyon crevice,
it'll be beyond Yuhua Temple.)

390
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,559
Young Lady, let me send you
on your final journey.

391
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,160
In your next life,
avoid being born a He.

392
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,400
Your continued existence
remains a threat

393
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,359
to the He family.

394
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,119
A mere woman

395
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,960
daring to seek military glory?

396
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,119
Preposterous delusions!

397
00:25:45,323 --> 00:25:49,304
(One month later)

398
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,319
(I can see again.)

399
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,000
(Where am I?)

400
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,279
(Didn't I die?)

401
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:01,000
With great effort,

402
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,559
I saved you

403
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,000
and restored your vision.

404
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,079
Why do you

405
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:04,799
keep moving?

406
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,680
Master.

407
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,080
(Liu Buwang, He Yan's master)

408
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,880
Last I saw you so weakened

409
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:14,640
was when I rescued you

410
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,680
from that mountain of corpses

411
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,160
on the battlefield.

412
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,279
Why ended up

413
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:20,160
like that again?

414
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:24,000
I thought

415
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,279
I could survive.

416
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,039
Unexpectedly,

417
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,599
I misjudged human nature.

418
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,039
They didn't just silence me

419
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,880
but sought to ensure

420
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,480
I'd never speak again.

421
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,279
Your family

422
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,839
has mastered the art

423
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,799
of deception to perfection.

424
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,440
Master,

425
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,799
news was scarce at Yuhua Temple.

426
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:01,960
Do you know

427
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,480
how the Xiao family fares now?

428
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,119
Has General Xiao's name

429
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,240
been cleared?

430
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,680
The entire court

431
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,680
condemned Xiao Zhongwu.

432
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:12,920
To stabilize the court, His Majesty

433
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,119
declared him guilty soon

434
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:16,559
and almost

435
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,680
took away Xiao Army's
conscription rights.

436
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
How could this happen?

437
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,119
Didn't His Majesty investigate?

438
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,640
General Fengyun,

439
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:25,319
as fellow generals,

440
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:27,720
I deeply respect General Xiao.

441
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:30,160
But in matters of righteousness,

442
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,599
we must not speak falsely.

443
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,160
Righteousness?

444
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,759
Does your righteousness

445
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:36,960
mean delaying reinforcements

446
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,200
and letting my father,

447
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,759
along with 30,000 Xiao soldiers,

448
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,079
die in vain?

449
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:46,599
I immediately dispatched troops

450
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,359
upon receiving the distress call,

451
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,960
without any delay.

452
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:52,680
Had I not turned the tide,

453
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,079
Wutuo's cavalry

454
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,519
would have reached here long ago.

455
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:00,599
As a witness, General Feihong testified

456
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,839
before His Majesty

457
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,279
and firmly insisted

458
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,559
on Xiao Zhongwu's guilt.

459
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,119
With such crucial witnesses present,

460
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,920
they didn't look further.

461
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:23,599
He Rufei,

462
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,319
it was you

463
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,640
who delayed reinforcement

464
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,799
and caused my father

465
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,160
and the Xiao Army troops

466
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,680
to perish tragically!

467
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,480
Childhood classmates first,

468
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,160
and then

469
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,039
frontier commanders.

470
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,680
He Rufei,

471
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,039
after all these years apart,

472
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,839
why did you become so wretched?

473
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,079
(With my mask off)

474
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,759
(and my ties with the He family cut,)

475
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,759
(from now on,)

476
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,720
(I am simply He Yan.)

477
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,559
(In this vast world,)

478
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:49,000
(I'm no longer anyone's substitute.)

479
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,119
(He Rufei stole my title
as General Feihong,)

480
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,759
(tried to kill me, and ruined my name.)

481
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:59,200
(I won't let him off.)

482
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,359
(I will return to the army)

483
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
(and honorably)

484
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,119
(reclaim everything that's mine.)

485
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:25,752
(Yezhou Garrison)

486
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,039
Thank you.
