That's all

23
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,620
for today.

24
00:01:54,101 --> 00:01:55,140
Remember

25
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,381
to review what you've learned.

26
00:01:58,181 --> 00:01:58,860
Tomorrow,

27
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:01,420
I will personally test you.

28
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,260
Understood.

29
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,461
He always wears a mask.

30
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,260
What's wrong with him?

31
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:15,741
You'll know.

32
00:02:18,412 --> 00:02:19,064
(Huainanzi)

33
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:20,780
Give it back!

34
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:21,780
Come take it back.

35
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:23,141
Come on!

36
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:24,581
Come get it.

37
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:25,540
Come on.

38
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,360
Come on.

39
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,540
You can't get it.

40
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:31,461
You can't get it.

41
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:33,944
Give it back!

42
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,380
Give it back!

43
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:43,512
Let's go.

44
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,301
Thanks.

45
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,540
Short and dumb.

46
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:49,701
I wonder

47
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:50,820
how you got in.

48
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,780
You eat more at night.

49
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,701
Xianchang Academy

50
00:02:57,701 --> 00:02:58,820
doesn't select me by height.

51
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:00,261
Besides,

52
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,461
I'm not dumb.

53
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:14,520
=Episode 3=

54
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,901
Bye, Commander Xiao.

55
00:04:33,061 --> 00:04:33,740
It's you again.

56
00:04:34,872 --> 00:04:36,770
(Xiao)

57
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,141
He's doing great today.

58
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:19,420
He doesn't lag behind.

59
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:21,740
When fighting me yesterday,

60
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:23,901
he wasn't weak at all.

61
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,980
So, he's been pretending.

62
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,300
Seems we need a more enticing bait.

63
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:29,980
Let's see

64
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,501
when his true colors emerge.

65
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,381
Since you've doubted

66
00:05:33,381 --> 00:05:34,540
He Yan's identity,

67
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:36,061
why stay quiet?

68
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:38,220
When fighting him,

69
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,821
I sensed his physical weakness,

70
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:43,100
yet his moves flowed effortlessly.

71
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,220
Clearly, he's not an amateur.

72
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:47,420
He's slippery.

73
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:49,300
Without solid evidence,

74
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,340
he won't confess.

75
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,261
Our task

76
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,980
is to expose his flaws openly.

77
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:00,821
Shen Han.

78
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:03,621
Do something for me.

79
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,328
Yes.

80
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:10,420
- Let me help you.
- Move.

81
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,100
Come on!

82
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,360
(Jiuqi Camp)

83
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,340
So impressive!

84
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,780
If I could

85
00:07:10,061 --> 00:07:10,901
be as brave as them,

86
00:07:10,901 --> 00:07:11,608
that'd be great.

87
00:07:11,821 --> 00:07:12,941
Who are they?

88
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,061
Why so valiant?

89
00:07:14,461 --> 00:07:15,180
Jiuqi Camp.

90
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,821
Jiuqi Camp?

91
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,581
What's that?

92
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:19,740
You don't know?

93
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:21,220
It was founded by Marshal Xiao.

94
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:23,141
It accepts elite warriors only.

95
00:07:23,581 --> 00:07:24,621
All in black armor.

96
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:26,420
They're invincible,

97
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,941
the core force of Xiao Army.

98
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,180
All enemies fear them.

99
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:30,340
Why's everyone

100
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,021
suddenly talking about them?

101
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:33,100
Someone

102
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,061
started it.

103
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:35,261
But no one

104
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:36,381
would refuse joining, right?

105
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:42,061
(They're talking about Jiuqi Camp.)

106
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:44,780
(Could it be planned?)

107
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,381
(Xiao Jue noticed something)

108
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,300
(during last night's fight.)

109
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:52,340
(He set a bait)

110
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:53,701
(to hook me.)

111
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:56,184
(Baiting me?)

112
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,901
(I'll play along)

113
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,901
(and join the camp.)

114
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:01,100
(I will do it honorably,)

115
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:01,980
(flawlessly.)

116
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:04,261
(Who's bait? Who's prey?)

117
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:05,461
(Game's still on.)

118
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:06,808
Mr. Shen.

119
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:08,056
Mr. Shen.

120
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,621
Zoning out?

121
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,061
Mr. Shen.

122
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:15,192
Work harder,

123
00:08:15,581 --> 00:08:16,780
and you can join them too.

124
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,100
They're so formidable.

125
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,100
I'm joining them.

126
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:25,660
Don't rush to join them

127
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,501
just because of that.

128
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,300
They often spearhead the frontlines,

129
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:29,180
where casualties

130
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,141
remain alarmingly high.

131
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,501
That's perfect then.

132
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:33,141
They need fresh recruits.

133
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,340
I need military merits.

134
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,901
If I join the Jiuqi Camp,

135
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,141
it's win-win.

136
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,061
We do

137
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,581
select one recruit annually.

138
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,552
However,

139
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:44,660
it must be
the most outstanding candidate.

140
00:08:45,381 --> 00:08:45,940
This year,

141
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,780
save yourselves the trouble.

142
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,501
The best candidate is

143
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,981
right before you.

144
00:08:53,021 --> 00:08:53,621
Good.

145
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,341
I'll be watching your performance.

146
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:03,501
He.

147
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,056
Come quick!

148
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:05,141
Look, meat flatbreads.

149
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:14,700
That flatbread

150
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:15,861
is mine.

151
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,261
Yours?

152
00:09:18,221 --> 00:09:18,981
Call its name

153
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,660
and see if it answers you.

154
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,901
Who can prove this is yours?

155
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:24,540
I'm eating it.

156
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,700
What can you do?

157
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,981
What can I do about it?

158
00:09:32,861 --> 00:09:33,464
You...

159
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,264
You...

160
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:35,672
Yes.

161
00:09:36,221 --> 00:09:36,856
I did it.

162
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:38,021
Who can verify that?

163
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,981
What can you do about it?

164
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:41,621
You...

165
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,101
Want a fight?

166
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,552
Fine.

167
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,221
Wait for me after training.

168
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:49,141
I'll make you pay.

169
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:51,060
Enough, He.

170
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,540
Don't stoop to his level.

171
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,300
Since he took my food once,

172
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,820
he might do it again.

173
00:09:56,741 --> 00:09:57,780
If he takes my food daily,

174
00:09:58,501 --> 00:09:59,341
should I starve

175
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:00,101
every single day?

176
00:10:00,741 --> 00:10:01,261
That is

177
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,261
so not fair.

178
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:04,901
Are you talking with me

179
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:06,141
about fairness?

180
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:08,261
With your weakness,

181
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,180
you won't

182
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,741
survive a month here.

183
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,780
Not even a month.

184
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:13,101
No need to wait.

185
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,660
In ten days,

186
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:15,861
at training field,

187
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,221
I'll defeat you in archery,

188
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,381
your best skill.

189
00:10:24,981 --> 00:10:26,861
Are you crazy?

190
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:29,460
You understand your own words?

191
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,540
Which part

192
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,580
did you not hear?

193
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:33,700
Let me repeat myself.

194
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,381
In ten days,

195
00:10:36,101 --> 00:10:37,501
I will defeat you.

196
00:10:38,621 --> 00:10:39,420
Pretty boy,

197
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:41,141
you're very bold.

198
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,576
Alright.

199
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:45,141
That's a bold wager.

200
00:10:45,141 --> 00:10:46,341
- Yes.
- Good.

201
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,820
If you lose,

202
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,420
you'll become an army cook.

203
00:10:51,221 --> 00:10:51,832
Deal.

204
00:10:52,341 --> 00:10:53,540
But if you lose,

205
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:55,101
you'll call me boss.

206
00:10:59,901 --> 00:11:00,940
Don't humiliate yourself.

207
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,820
In ten days,

208
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,101
I'll challenge you to a spear duel.

209
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,540
Do you dare to accept it?

210
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:09,460
Since you're so reckless,

211
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:10,901
I'll play along.

212
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,528
Good.

213
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:15,341
In ten days,

214
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,420
we'll compete.

215
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,460
How dare you!

216
00:11:19,381 --> 00:11:20,741
- Commander.
- Commander.

217
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,780
Brawling right after joining the army?

218
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:24,700
Have you no respect for discipline?

219
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,141
It's okay.

220
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:29,460
He wants to join the Jiuqi Camp.

221
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:31,300
I'll see

222
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,460
if he's qualified.

You work so hard,

246
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,501
yet you're still weak.

247
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,101
The sneaky person at the bathing pool

248
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,580
was you, right?

249
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,101
A while ago,

250
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:39,901
I was exhausted from training.

251
00:13:40,221 --> 00:13:41,580
So, I went to bathe to relax.

252
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:45,060
The person who was bathing that night

253
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,700
was actually you.

254
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,420
However,

255
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,060
I panicked and fled recklessly

256
00:13:50,341 --> 00:13:51,101
that night.

257
00:13:51,501 --> 00:13:52,861
I hope you won't blame me.

258
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:55,261
You panicked?

259
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,261
Sure, I did.

260
00:14:00,861 --> 00:14:01,901
You're suspicious

261
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,420
and a liar.

262
00:14:03,981 --> 00:14:05,501
What's your real intention?

263
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,760
I want a trainer.

264
00:14:09,621 --> 00:14:10,264
What?

265
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,101
No offense,

266
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,141
but please train me, Commander.

267
00:14:21,901 --> 00:14:22,820
What makes you think

268
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,060
I'll train you?

269
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,501
Otherwise, did you

270
00:14:27,981 --> 00:14:29,420
come out so late at night

271
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,901
to ambush a recruit for fun?

272
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,660
I know

273
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:34,460
you're concerned about me.

274
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,660
You think

275
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,861
I have potential.

276
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,540
Practice needs a partner.

277
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,861
Practicing alone

278
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,021
won't work out.

279
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,700
If you train me,

280
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,261
I'm certain I'll make great progress.

281
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:48,180
Quite cheeky.

282
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,621
If you can resist ten strikes

283
00:14:56,621 --> 00:14:57,420
in a circle,

284
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,420
I'll train you.

285
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:02,700
Deal.

286
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,460
Can't even hold it.

287
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:06,940
Why should I train you?

288
00:16:07,141 --> 00:16:07,704
I...

289
00:16:48,221 --> 00:16:48,861
Commander.

290
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:50,700
Ten strikes done.

291
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:53,060
I'm still in.

292
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,060
My fault.

293
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:04,180
Accidentally,

294
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,621
I offended you.

295
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:11,861
Commander.

296
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,141
A promise

297
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,220
is a promise.

298
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,740
You can't go back on it.

299
00:17:16,381 --> 00:17:17,420
Breaking a promise

300
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:19,101
is a disgrace.

301
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,384
Commander.

302
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,301
Every night, Xu hour.

303
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:36,381
Thank you.

304
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,940
Thank you, master.

305
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:44,940
This is your first lesson.

306
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:46,621
Remember your words.

307
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,781
If you can't win,

308
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,821
get out of Yezhou Garrison.

309
00:18:00,821 --> 00:18:02,740
Since you're using
the Jiuqi Camp as bait,

310
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,381
I'll absolutely

311
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:05,500
take this chance.

312
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,141
I'll certainly use you

313
00:18:10,061 --> 00:18:11,500
to succeed.

314
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,861
He learned quite quickly.

315
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:57,901
(Commander.)

316
00:18:58,341 --> 00:18:59,061
(A promise)

317
00:18:59,381 --> 00:19:00,220
(is a promise.)

318
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,700
(You can't go back on it.)

319
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,341
(Breaking a promise)

320
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:05,061
(is a disgrace.)

321
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,260
I never agreed to anything.

322
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:25,781
I've mastered the techniques,

323
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:27,460
yet he shows no concern.

324
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,624
It's not good.

325
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,341
I must make him

326
00:19:30,341 --> 00:19:31,660
witness my progress.

327
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,680
Commander.

328
00:19:39,341 --> 00:19:40,248
Are you there?

329
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,101
Qinglang.

330
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:46,700
Long time no see.

331
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,460
(I once asked a swordsmith)

332
00:20:53,061 --> 00:20:54,381
to forge two swords.

333
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:56,420
One is named Yinqiu.

334
00:20:56,901 --> 00:20:58,220
I gave that to Huaijin

335
00:20:59,141 --> 00:20:59,940
when he came of age.

336
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,144
This one

337
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,420
is named Qinglang.

338
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,736
Today,

339
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,740
I'll give it to you.

340
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:08,920
Father.

341
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,260
Why did you give him Qinglang?

342
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,020
This sword is valuable.

343
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,341
I can't take it.

344
00:21:16,821 --> 00:21:17,980
Constant effort

345
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,260
brings success.

346
00:21:20,061 --> 00:21:20,940
Someday,

347
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,381
you two will become

348
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,541
the twin stars of Wei,

349
00:21:23,901 --> 00:21:24,861
working together.

350
00:21:25,141 --> 00:21:25,816
Wielding swords

351
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,101
to defend our land

352
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,541
and protect people.

353
00:21:30,061 --> 00:21:30,700
Take it.

354
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,224
I will not

355
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,940
betray your trust.

356
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,061
You're unworthy of this Qinglang Sword

357
00:21:53,101 --> 00:21:54,420
from my father.

358
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:18,660
It's quite a sharp sword.

359
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,700
It's rare to see.

360
00:22:20,141 --> 00:22:21,260
So, I couldn't help

361
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,700
touching it.

362
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,660
Commander.

363
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,500
You're magnanimous.

364
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,940
You won't blame me, will you?

365
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,980
The sword you're holding

366
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,621
is quite great too!

367
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,301
Why did you come to my tent?

368
00:22:42,781 --> 00:22:44,101
I've practiced diligently

369
00:22:44,381 --> 00:22:45,980
and mastered what you taught me.

370
00:22:46,301 --> 00:22:47,821
Aren't you going to check on me?

371
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,020
I'm busy.

372
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,240
Come.

373
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,420
I knew

374
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,581
you were responsible.

375
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,180
Bet on Wang Ba.

376
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,141
Quick! Tell me!

377
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,020
Who to bet on?

378
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:15,220
On Wang Ba.

379
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,460
- On Wang Ba.
- Me too.

380
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:17,341
And you?

381
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,341
Jiang Jiao.

382
00:23:18,341 --> 00:23:19,740
Jiang Jiao? Two on Jiang Jiao?

383
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,781
(Jiang Jiao, He Yan, Wang Ba)
Three flatbreads?

384
00:23:20,781 --> 00:23:21,621
I'm all in!

385
00:23:21,821 --> 00:23:22,660
My bet's on Wang Ba.

386
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:23,581
Great!

387
00:23:23,581 --> 00:23:24,260
- Wang Ba!
- One!

388
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,420
- On Jiang Jiao?
- Six!

389
00:23:25,581 --> 00:23:26,821
- Jiang Jiao!
- Jiang Jiao!

390
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,541
(Wang Ba)
Five on Jiang.

391
00:23:28,061 --> 00:23:29,740
Who's got flatbreads left?

392
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,980
Six on Wang Ba.

393
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,180
- And you?
- Jiang Jiao!

394
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,381
You note it all down?

395
00:23:34,821 --> 00:23:35,576
(He Yan)
Of course.

396
00:23:36,861 --> 00:23:37,740
(Someone actually bet)

397
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,901
(on He Yan earlier than me.)

398
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,088
Guys!

399
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,101
Listen,

400
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,301
I am

401
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,581
betting ten flatbreads

402
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,368
(Jiang Jiao, He Yan, Wang Ba)
on He Yan.

403
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,220
- What?
- Sir.

404
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,020
Are you sure?

405
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:48,700
Absolutely!

406
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:50,861
Very impressive, Mr. Cheng.

407
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,980
He's never short on flatbreads.

408
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:55,061
Place your bets! Quickly!

409
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:56,901
Wang Ba!

410
00:23:57,101 --> 00:23:58,700
- Wang Ba!
- Go!

411
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,381
Wang Ba, come on!

412
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:00,381
Wang Ba, come on!

413
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,180
You'll win.

414
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,740
- You'll win.
- Wang Ba will win!

415
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,700
- He!
- Wang Ba!

416
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,581
Go for it!

417
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,740
Show your skills!

418
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,940
Go, Wang Ba!

419
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,700
Wang Ba!

420
00:24:10,821 --> 00:24:12,260
Wang Ba, come on!

421
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,020
Wang Ba, come on!

422
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,700
Wang Ba!

423
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,500
Show your skills!

424
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,141
You'll win!

425
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,061
Wang Ba!

426
00:24:16,061 --> 00:24:16,740
Go for it, He!

427
00:24:16,861 --> 00:24:19,020
Wang Ba!

428
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,141
Go for it, He!

429
00:24:20,341 --> 00:24:21,341
He!

430
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,381
Wang Ba!

431
00:24:22,381 --> 00:24:23,260
Go for it, He!

432
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:23,901
You'll win!

433
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,541
Lei Hou.

434
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,621
You bet on me?

435
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:26,980
I didn't bet on anyone.

436
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,460
Hey.

437
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:30,381
Change your mind now,

438
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:31,660
or you'll humiliate yourself.

439
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:33,341
Exactly!

440
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,260
Give it up!

441
00:24:37,368 --> 00:24:37,880
So funny.

442
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:39,621
I was about to say the same.

443
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,621
You'll regret it.

444
00:24:42,621 --> 00:24:45,301
Wang Ba!

445
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:46,101
You'll win!

446
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,460
Wang Ba, come on!

447
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,260
You'll win!

448
00:24:48,301 --> 00:24:49,621
Wang Ba, come on!

449
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,500
Wang Ba, come on!

450
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:01,420
Wang Ba won!

451
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,541
Impressive!

452
00:25:07,301 --> 00:25:08,141
Wang Ba won.

453
00:25:11,141 --> 00:25:13,220
Awesome!

454
00:25:13,341 --> 00:25:14,420
Wang Ba won!

455
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,581
Impressive.

456
00:25:17,101 --> 00:25:17,861
Give it up!

457
00:25:22,061 --> 00:25:22,821
Give it up!

458
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:28,020
Give it up!

459
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,141
- Give it up!
- Be quiet!

460
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,420
You're humiliating yourself.

461
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,301
Exactly.

462
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:36,220
Indeed.

463
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,020
Give it up!

464
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,940
Give it up!

465
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,020
Look at him.

466
00:25:40,101 --> 00:25:41,420
I knew it.

467
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,621
He's bound to lose.

468
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:43,821
Give it up!

469
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,861
Give it up!

470
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,101
Give it up!

471
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:01,901
Get out of here.

472
00:26:16,301 --> 00:26:16,952
Well...

473
00:26:17,821 --> 00:26:18,740
Pierced right through!

474
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,541
Quite strong.

475
00:26:20,541 --> 00:26:21,341
Is he that skilled?

476
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:23,420
- Well...
- Precise and powerful.

477
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,700
He's pretty strong.

478
00:26:27,341 --> 00:26:28,381
Congrats!

479
00:26:28,861 --> 00:26:29,901
Among these recruits,

480
00:26:30,061 --> 00:26:31,700
you've got a capable heroine.

481
00:26:31,781 --> 00:26:32,472
No,

482
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,700
a capable hero.

483
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:36,020
Both Wang Ba and He Yan

484
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,101
are doing great.

485
00:26:37,341 --> 00:26:38,781
Credit goes to Mr. Shen.

486
00:26:39,061 --> 00:26:39,940
Not really, Mr. Cheng.

487
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,341
I can't claim the credit.

488
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,341
Commander Xiao's

489
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,500
training methods work.

490
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,020
My discerning eyes

491
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,381
never misjudge talent.

492
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,861
Remember our wager?

493
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:50,381
No backing out.

494
00:26:52,621 --> 00:26:53,141
Mr. Shen.

495
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,101
Who's your pick?

496
00:26:54,861 --> 00:26:55,740
Wang Ba

497
00:26:56,101 --> 00:26:56,781
has potential.

498
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,101
He was a bandit

499
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:58,940
and a rebel.

500
00:26:59,220 --> 00:26:59,861
But he's good

501
00:27:00,061 --> 00:27:01,180
at archery.

502
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,500
He Yan

503
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:03,660
works hard.

504
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,581
He's mild-tempered.

505
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,460
A few years later,

506
00:27:06,781 --> 00:27:07,660
he'll become

507
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,101
the best of the recruits.

508
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:10,301
You've misjudged, Mr. Shen.

509
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,420
The rebellious one

510
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:13,460
isn't Wang Ba.

511
00:27:16,061 --> 00:27:17,101
But He Yan

512
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,980
is getting more interesting.

513
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:23,901
After your rest,

514
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,260
- let's...
- I'm rested.

515
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,861
Let's begin.

516
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:32,781
- Go!
- You can do it!

517
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,460
- Jiang Jiao, go for it!
- Go!

518
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:35,460
Go for it!

519
00:27:36,901 --> 00:27:38,220
- Come on!
- You can do it!

520
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:42,712
Good!

521
00:27:43,381 --> 00:27:44,581
Excellent!

522
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:45,660
Keep going!

523
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:46,861
Go for it!

524
00:27:48,861 --> 00:27:49,901
Amazing!

525
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,192
Go for it!

526
00:28:05,861 --> 00:28:07,541
Bravo!

527
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,536
Splendid!

528
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:10,821
Who won?

529
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,020
(Given his strength,)

530
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,660
(is he actually a recruit?)

531
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,500
Why

532
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,420
is He just defending?

533
00:28:21,341 --> 00:28:22,180
Faster! Quicker!

534
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,500
One more strike to beat him!

535
00:28:37,581 --> 00:28:38,420
(He's testing me.)

536
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,180
That dodge

537
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:40,980
was so good.

538
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:43,320
Commander.

539
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,460
He Yan's evasive maneuver is

540
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:45,980
like yours.

541
00:28:50,101 --> 00:28:50,861
Yet he failed

542
00:28:50,901 --> 00:28:51,940
to dodge your stone?

543
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,781
He chose not to dodge.

544
00:28:56,381 --> 00:28:56,940
(No weapons)

545
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:57,720
(can defeat)

546
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,616
(spears.)

547
00:29:10,821 --> 00:29:12,341
He Yan!

548
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,740
Few people are skilled at spear.

549
00:29:14,101 --> 00:29:14,901
But once they do,

550
00:29:15,301 --> 00:29:16,020
they will not

551
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,541
fear all other weapons.

552
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,584
Well done!

553
00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:21,381
This Jiang Jiao is useless.

554
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:22,420
Unbelievable.

555
00:29:25,101 --> 00:29:25,660
Pretty boy.

556
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:28,500
What?

557
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:32,700
A bet's a bet.

558
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,032
Boss.

559
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:38,101
Oh, right.

560
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:40,141
I almost forgot.

561
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,621
There's someone else

562
00:29:46,581 --> 00:29:47,740
who needs to call me boss.

563
00:29:53,901 --> 00:29:54,420
Wang Ba.

564
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,740
It's your turn.

565
00:29:56,301 --> 00:29:57,901
You're not trying to back out, are you?

566
00:30:05,901 --> 00:30:07,020
Move aside!

567
00:30:13,341 --> 00:30:14,861
B-Bo...

568
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,700
You can...

569
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,740
Boss.

570
00:30:21,141 --> 00:30:22,061
You heard me.

571
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,301
Sure, I did.

572
00:30:23,861 --> 00:30:24,740
I just never expected

573
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,821
you'd actually do it.

574
00:30:26,861 --> 00:30:29,541
As a real man...

575
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,260
That's it.

576
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,141
I did it.

577
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:33,660
Stop looking!

578
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,500
Get out of here!

579
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,500
Get out of here!

580
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,061
Let's go.

581
00:30:40,141 --> 00:30:41,341
- Get out of here.
- Go.

582
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,621
Let's train harder.

583
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,541
I lost the bet,

584
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:45,341
but I watched a good match.

585
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,141
Sure.

586
00:30:46,141 --> 00:30:46,660
Let's go.

587
00:30:47,341 --> 00:30:48,061
Commander.

588
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,500
Commander.

589
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,621
You forgot this.

590
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,260
You did well.

591
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,621
Keep it.

592
00:31:01,101 --> 00:31:02,420
I'll remember

593
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,061
your kindness forever.

594
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,061
Coming!

595
00:31:14,381 --> 00:31:15,000
Flatbreads.

596
00:31:16,901 --> 00:31:17,621
Guys! Listen up!

597
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,260
Thanks to Mr. He,

598
00:31:19,581 --> 00:31:21,180
I won the bet

599
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,381
in today's match.

600
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:23,101
Tonight,

601
00:31:23,301 --> 00:31:23,901
it's my treat.

602
00:31:24,061 --> 00:31:25,220
Just help yourselves.

603
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,740
What are you waiting for?

604
00:31:27,901 --> 00:31:28,700
All of us

605
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,581
should thank Mr. Cheng.

606
00:31:31,101 --> 00:31:32,141
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

607
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,101
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

608
00:31:34,781 --> 00:31:35,821
Let's eat!

609
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,861
Let's eat!

610
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,621
Smells good!

611
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:41,980
I know

612
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,581
I am good-looking.

613
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:44,581
However,

614
00:31:44,581 --> 00:31:45,901
you staring so boldly at me

615
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,381
is making me

616
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,740
feel rather uncomfortable.

617
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,700
Mr. Cheng.

618
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,781
You're overthinking.

619
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:53,260
I doubt

620
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,500
the flatbreads you won

621
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,500
are enough for us.

622
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,061
This is my way of repaying you.

623
00:31:58,301 --> 00:31:59,940
You may lose more than you gain.

624
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,020
It's worth it.

625
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,740
Bring the soup if it's ready.

626
00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:07,220
Great!

627
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,061
Smells so good.

628
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,141
Smells so good.

629
00:32:12,141 --> 00:32:13,700
Exactly! Where are the bowls?

630
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,220
- Give me a bowl.
- Thanks, Mr. Cheng!

631
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:16,420
The soup is served.

632
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,341
Your title as Yezhou's top warrior

633
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,581
might be in jeopardy.

634
00:32:20,301 --> 00:32:20,901
Mr. He

635
00:32:21,101 --> 00:32:22,621
has trained hard this month.

636
00:32:22,821 --> 00:32:24,420
That's why he shocked everyone today.

637
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,260
Both of us

638
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,660
stop being jealous.

639
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,301
Mr. He.

640
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:31,821
Congrats!

641
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:34,020
Thanks, Mr. Lei.

642
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,792
Commander.

643
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,980
At the training field,

644
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:42,940
you said

645
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,781
he chose not to dodge.
What did you mean?

646
00:32:45,581 --> 00:32:46,861
I used the Jiuqi Camp as bait

647
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,660
to lure him to duel.

648
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,500
While he was overwhelmed,

649
00:32:50,621 --> 00:32:51,420
I secretly acted

650
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,220
to force him to reveal some flaw.

651
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:55,901
Unexpectedly,

652
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:57,901
he actually

653
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,061
discerned my intention.

654
00:32:59,621 --> 00:33:00,660
So, he didn't dodge.

655
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,420
He's not only resilient,

656
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:06,581
but also clever.

657
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,781
He's a formidable opponent.

658
00:33:10,061 --> 00:33:11,061
Anyway,

659
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,301
He Yan

660
00:33:12,301 --> 00:33:13,460
is definitely up to no good.

661
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,500
Shall I go arrest him first?

662
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,581
No rush.

663
00:33:17,861 --> 00:33:19,020
So, you already have a plan?

664
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,460
These new recruits

665
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,940
have been training

666
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,700
for a full month.

667
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,381
It's time for their competition.

668
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:27,220
Then

669
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,381
the truth will reveal itself.
