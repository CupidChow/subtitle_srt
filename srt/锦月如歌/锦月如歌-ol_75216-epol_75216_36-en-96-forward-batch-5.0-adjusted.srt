00:01:56,227 --> 00:01:57,067
It is

24
00:01:57,906 --> 00:01:59,186
the war drums being beaten.

25
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:05,907
Commander.

26
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:07,027
Crisis at the border.

27
00:02:07,587 --> 00:02:08,466
Wutuo attacks Mingshui

28
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:09,867
and Huayuan simultaneously.

29
00:02:11,947 --> 00:02:13,547
No time to waste. Go to the palace now.

30
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:19,867
(Longtai Hall)

31
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:21,987
Wutuo actually broke the peace treaty

32
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:23,267
and invaded us again.

33
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:25,267
That's so unscrupulous!

34
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:26,987
Xiao Jue.

35
00:02:27,107 --> 00:02:28,587
You lead troops to Mingshui.

36
00:02:28,707 --> 00:02:30,746
This time, we must teach Wutuo a lesson

37
00:02:30,746 --> 00:02:32,587
and ensure
they never dare invade us again.

38
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:34,827
As you command.

39
00:02:35,746 --> 00:02:36,586
He Yan.

40
00:02:36,827 --> 00:02:38,226
I order you to lead the Fuyue Army

41
00:02:38,786 --> 00:02:40,307
and defend Rundu with Li Kuang

42
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,107
to guard against Wutuo's raids.

43
00:02:43,226 --> 00:02:44,066
Your Majesty.

44
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:45,226
There's no battle in Rundu.

45
00:02:45,746 --> 00:02:46,626
Yet Wutuo's forces

46
00:02:47,027 --> 00:02:48,066
are approaching Huayuan.

47
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:49,107
It's threatening.

48
00:02:51,226 --> 00:02:52,387
There's no current conflict,

49
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:54,906
but Wutuo is full of tricks.

50
00:02:55,547 --> 00:02:56,387
We must be alert.

51
00:02:57,027 --> 00:02:57,867
As for Huayuan,

52
00:02:58,506 --> 00:02:59,587
I've sent Yan He there,

53
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:02,547
with Chu Zhao as military supervisor

54
00:03:02,946 --> 00:03:03,786
to assist.

55
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:13,307
Yes, understood.

56
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,186
His Majesty wants me to guard Rundu,

57
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:31,466
but Li Kuang is there.

58
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:32,666
Why send me too?

59
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:34,107
In my opinion,

60
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:35,867
His Majesty still distrusts us.

61
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:38,227
An emperor's balance of power
is an age-old strategy.

62
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:39,867
But there's wisdom

63
00:03:40,226 --> 00:03:41,427
in this arrangement.

64
00:03:42,226 --> 00:03:44,427
Rundu lies between Huayuan and Mingshui.

65
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:47,547
It allows quick support to both cities.

66
00:03:48,387 --> 00:03:49,227
Promise me

67
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:50,906
you'll return safely.

68
00:03:53,307 --> 00:03:54,746
Take Wang Ba's team

69
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:56,427
to Rundu with you.

70
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:58,147
There's no battle there.

71
00:03:58,587 --> 00:03:59,746
Keep them with you.

72
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,626
I have Feinu and Shen Han.

73
00:04:02,147 --> 00:04:03,066
With them guarding you,

74
00:04:03,387 --> 00:04:04,227
I'll feel assured.

75
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:06,626
Okay.

76
00:04:12,346 --> 00:04:13,186
Miss He.

77
00:04:19,946 --> 00:04:21,747
Congratulations.
You've won imperial favor

78
00:04:22,426 --> 00:04:24,306
and secured the supervisor position.

79
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:56,426
A little tiger is roaring.

80
00:04:57,187 --> 00:04:58,947
A little tiger is roaring.

81
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,747
A little tiger is roaring.

82
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:06,626
What's wrong?

83
00:05:07,027 --> 00:05:07,867
The baby kicked me.

84
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:11,906
Behave yourself,

85
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,787
or I'll punish you when I return.

86
00:05:15,027 --> 00:05:16,426
Don't threaten our baby.

87
00:05:24,187 --> 00:05:25,027
Yan He.

88
00:05:26,147 --> 00:05:26,987
This time,

89
00:05:27,747 --> 00:05:29,187
let me go with you.

90
00:05:30,306 --> 00:05:33,067
I went along with troops before.

91
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:35,627
This is different!

92
00:05:36,027 --> 00:05:37,546
You're pregnant now.

93
00:05:38,707 --> 00:05:40,466
The due date is still weeks away.

94
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:42,706
Besides,

95
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:44,507
as a general's wife,

96
00:05:45,106 --> 00:05:46,907
I can endure hardships.

97
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:50,107
Fine.

98
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,387
I'll stay by your side

99
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:53,866
and see the birth of our baby.

100
00:05:59,147 --> 00:06:01,666
I'll be the best father in the capital.

101
00:06:10,051 --> 00:06:15,756
(Xiao Mansion)

102
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:21,456
(Xiao Mansion)

103
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:26,466
You guys

104
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,067
focus on the war.

105
00:06:28,587 --> 00:06:30,426
My wife and I will handle home affairs.

106
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:39,946
Miss He.

107
00:06:39,986 --> 00:06:41,106
May you return safely.

108
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:13,008
(Xiao Mansion)

109
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,400
(Rundu City)

110
00:07:57,026 --> 00:07:58,706
General He, time to eat.

111
00:08:19,147 --> 00:08:19,987
General He.

112
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,507
I heard you returned
to write battle reports.

113
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:24,147
Haven't started yet?

114
00:08:26,226 --> 00:08:27,106
Nothing to report.

115
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:28,827
Wutuo forces

116
00:08:29,027 --> 00:08:30,387
continue assaults on Huayuan

117
00:08:30,747 --> 00:08:31,587
and Mingshui,

118
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:33,466
while Rundu remains peaceful.

119
00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:36,066
General.

120
00:08:39,906 --> 00:08:40,946
General! Emergency!

121
00:08:41,906 --> 00:08:42,786
New battle report.

122
00:08:42,946 --> 00:08:44,186
Wutuo sent reinforcements

123
00:08:44,267 --> 00:08:45,107
to attack Huayuan.

124
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:48,467
General Yan has fought nonstop
for two days.

125
00:08:50,787 --> 00:08:52,027
- Mai.
- Yes.

126
00:08:52,027 --> 00:08:52,987
You go tell Li Kuang

127
00:08:53,186 --> 00:08:54,387
that I'll leave 5,000 soldiers

128
00:08:54,507 --> 00:08:55,387
to defend the city.

129
00:08:56,946 --> 00:09:00,066
The rest will reinforce Huayuan with me.

130
00:09:00,747 --> 00:09:01,587
- Yes.
- Yes.

131
00:09:06,563 --> 00:09:09,679
(He)

132
00:09:28,227 --> 00:09:29,867
I heard you all rushed here

133
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:30,867
from Rundu

134
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:32,666
and repelled enemies with Yan He.

135
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:34,586
I've prepared a banquet

136
00:09:35,147 --> 00:09:36,066
to honor your victory.

137
00:09:37,227 --> 00:09:40,627
- Great.
- Great.

138
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:45,186
- Great.
- Great.

139
00:09:55,906 --> 00:09:58,146
Xiu, I'm back.

140
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,107
He has returned.

141
00:10:31,027 --> 00:10:31,867
Madam.

142
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:32,906
What's wrong?

143
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:41,307
Careful, Madam.

144
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:43,146
What's happening?

145
00:10:44,906 --> 00:10:45,746
Someone!

146
00:10:45,867 --> 00:10:46,946
Madam is going into labor.

147
00:10:47,107 --> 00:10:48,107
Someone!

148
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:51,387
- General Yan!
- General!

149
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:52,426
- General!
- General Yan!

150
00:10:53,546 --> 00:10:54,386
Medic!

151
00:10:54,507 --> 00:10:55,347
Medic!

152
00:10:55,507 --> 00:10:56,347
Medic!

153
00:10:56,706 --> 00:10:57,546
Don't.

154
00:10:59,347 --> 00:11:00,546
Don't tell Xiu.

155
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:03,546
She's pregnant.

156
00:11:04,387 --> 00:11:05,306
Don't alarm her.

157
00:11:06,706 --> 00:11:07,627
Hang in there!

158
00:11:08,107 --> 00:11:09,107
The medic is coming.

159
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:11,467
Promise me.

160
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:19,107
Xiu.

161
00:11:21,946 --> 00:11:22,786
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:58,706 --> 00:11:59,906
Take a deep breath and push!

163
00:11:59,906 --> 00:12:01,027
Deep breath, Madam.

164
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:01,906
Keep pushing!

165
00:12:01,906 --> 00:12:02,746
Push harder!

166
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:05,186
Push! Keep pushing!

167
00:12:05,186 --> 00:12:06,026
Breathe in.

168
00:12:06,586 --> 00:12:07,426
Breathe in.

169
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:08,467
Breathe in.

170
00:12:09,746 --> 00:12:10,586
Madam.

171
00:12:10,586 --> 00:12:11,786
Y-Yan He...

172
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,027
Push, Madam!

173
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:15,227
Push! Hold your breath!

174
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:18,147
Hold it! Keep holding!

175
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:19,107
Hold your breath!

176
00:12:19,107 --> 00:12:19,947
Almost done!

177
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:21,026
Yan He

178
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:25,027
is still mopping up remaining enemies
behind the lines.

179
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:26,627
He'll return later.

180
00:12:26,627 --> 00:12:27,467
Push harder, Madam!

181
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:29,706
Hold your breath and push!

182
00:12:29,706 --> 00:12:30,546
That's it!

183
00:12:30,546 --> 00:12:31,786
Hold and push!

184
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:35,107
It's born!

185
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:38,947
Madam!

186
00:12:39,347 --> 00:12:40,227
Congratulations!

187
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:41,507
It's a girl!

188
00:12:41,546 --> 00:12:42,386
She's born, Madam!

189
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,027
She's beautiful!

190
00:12:44,387 --> 00:12:45,227
Careful.

191
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:54,586
It's Muxia.

192
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:56,426
Muxia?

193
00:12:58,627 --> 00:12:59,546
Yan He chose this name.

194
00:13:00,306 --> 00:13:01,507
Liangjiang for a boy,

195
00:13:02,507 --> 00:13:03,867
Muxia for a girl.

196
00:13:06,426 --> 00:13:07,266
Muxia,

197
00:13:08,147 --> 00:13:09,666
your father is a great hero.

198
00:13:10,347 --> 00:13:11,627
Muxia, you will grow up

199
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:13,906
to carry on your father's legacy.

200
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:16,947
Muxia

201
00:13:18,186 --> 00:13:19,666
will become

202
00:13:20,546 --> 00:13:21,906
a good general

203
00:13:22,107 --> 00:13:22,947
like her father.

204
00:13:29,426 --> 00:13:30,266
So adorable.

205
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:34,347
Muxia.

206
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,187
Muxia.

207
00:13:40,676 --> 00:13:43,116
(Yan)

208
00:14:18,706 --> 00:14:21,666
Are Mrs. Yan and the child safe?

209
00:14:22,586 --> 00:14:23,426
Safe?

210
00:14:23,867 --> 00:14:24,707
Yes,

211
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:26,107
they're safe.

212
00:14:26,627 --> 00:14:29,227
But the child lost her father at birth.

213
00:14:29,946 --> 00:14:30,867
Father and daughter

214
00:14:31,946 --> 00:14:34,267
never even met.

215
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:37,867
This battle could have ended sooner

216
00:14:39,027 --> 00:14:40,306
with fewer casualties.

217
00:14:41,346 --> 00:14:43,747
All because of your loyal advice,

218
00:14:44,987 --> 00:14:45,946
His Majesty

219
00:14:47,027 --> 00:14:49,306
feared our concentrated military power,

220
00:14:50,107 --> 00:14:50,947
ordering me

221
00:14:51,627 --> 00:14:53,426
to station the Fuyue Army in Rundu,

222
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:56,227
scattering our forces.

223
00:14:57,107 --> 00:14:59,306
So, we couldn't deliver
a decisive blow to Wutuo.

224
00:15:04,147 --> 00:15:05,267
Is this the outcome

225
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:08,147
you wanted,

226
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:09,906
Mr. Chu?

227
00:15:21,747 --> 00:15:23,027
You don't deserve to get wasted.

228
00:15:25,147 --> 00:15:27,066
Stay sober and atone for this.

229
00:15:35,306 --> 00:15:36,146
This is

230
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:37,786
to honor the fallen soldiers.

231
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:50,666
(Zilan, you're smart and diligent.)

232
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,267
You will earn scholarly honors.

233
00:15:54,507 --> 00:15:55,467
When you grow up,

234
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:57,867
you'll become a good
and respectable official.

235
00:15:58,706 --> 00:16:01,066
(Then no one will
dare bully you anymore.)

236
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:07,626
Mother.

237
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:09,027
Don't cry, Zilan.

238
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:10,867
I'm just tired.

239
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:14,347
My poor son.

240
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:18,666
(Mother, I'll take you away
from the Chu family.)

241
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:22,027
We don't have to endure their insult.

242
00:16:25,627 --> 00:16:26,467
Mother.

243
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:28,186
Mother!

244
00:16:28,507 --> 00:16:30,627
(I only fear)

245
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:33,786
you'll end up alone.

246
00:16:36,347 --> 00:16:37,426
From now on,

247
00:16:38,426 --> 00:16:39,627
stop pushing yourself so hard.

248
00:16:41,507 --> 00:16:43,227
Spare yourself.

and ministers had been united,

with generals defending Wei,

I was wrong.

276
00:18:17,987 --> 00:18:18,907
It's Mingshui.

277
00:18:19,187 --> 00:18:20,386
After losing in Huayuan,

278
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:21,947
Wutuo sent more troops to Mingshui.

279
00:18:22,306 --> 00:18:23,467
Their troops from Huayuan

280
00:18:23,707 --> 00:18:24,947
are already advancing there.

281
00:18:25,947 --> 00:18:27,227
The Xiao Army can't

282
00:18:27,626 --> 00:18:29,267
resist much longer with weak forces.

283
00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:31,467
We must reinforce them!

284
00:18:32,106 --> 00:18:33,906
Mr. Jiang, you stay here.

285
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,426

in defending Huayuan.

286

Vice Director of the Secretariat,

337
00:24:51,146 --> 00:24:52,907
prioritized personal desires

338
00:24:52,907 --> 00:24:54,227
and sowed discord repeatedly,

339
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,866
making the military strength divided,

340
00:24:57,146 --> 00:24:59,626
allowing Wutuo's invasion.

341
00:24:59,786 --> 00:25:01,386
War reignited,

342
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:03,146
causing immense suffering.

343
00:25:03,707 --> 00:25:06,066
He is hereby dismissed

344
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:07,907
and exiled to the borderlands

345
00:25:08,187 --> 00:25:09,786
and will never return.

346
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:11,907
By Imperial Decree.

347
00:25:13,826 --> 00:25:14,907
Thanks for your hard work.

348
00:25:15,507 --> 00:25:16,347
Rise, please.

349
00:25:16,866 --> 00:25:17,786
Thank you.

350
00:25:22,947 --> 00:25:23,787
Your Majesty.

351
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:24,947
Amidst urgent warfare,

352
00:25:25,227 --> 00:25:26,826
I prioritized military necessity,

353
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:28,067
leaving Rundu

354
00:25:28,346 --> 00:25:29,187
without permission.

355
00:25:29,626 --> 00:25:31,427
This defied imperial orders.

356
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:32,947
I deserve punishment.

357
00:25:34,027 --> 00:25:34,867
Your Majesty.

358
00:25:35,947 --> 00:25:37,626
General Feihong
contributed to the victory.

359
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:38,826
She committed no crime.

360
00:25:40,546 --> 00:25:41,386
Good judgment.

361
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:42,747
Xiao Jue, you also

362
00:25:42,826 --> 00:25:43,947
contributed to the victory.

363
00:25:44,267 --> 00:25:45,146
Rewards for you both

364
00:25:45,306 --> 00:25:46,707
have been sent to your mansions.

365
00:25:47,027 --> 00:25:47,867
Well,

366
00:25:48,386 --> 00:25:49,667
you may leave.

367
00:25:50,747 --> 00:25:52,106
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

368
00:26:08,826 --> 00:26:09,666
Yan He.

369
00:26:12,586 --> 00:26:13,707
Actually,

370
00:26:14,586 --> 00:26:15,667
when I married you,

371
00:26:17,306 --> 00:26:18,146
I knew

372
00:26:20,467 --> 00:26:21,907
this day might come.

373
00:26:24,346 --> 00:26:25,507
But I never expected

374
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:28,747
that it'd happen so soon.

375
00:26:37,907 --> 00:26:38,866
But don't worry.

376
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:40,467
Since I've married you,

377
00:26:41,786 --> 00:26:43,027
I'll never regret it.

378
00:26:45,947 --> 00:26:47,027
No matter how difficult,

379
00:26:48,987 --> 00:26:50,306
I'll live on resolutely

380
00:26:54,626 --> 00:26:56,346
and raise our child well.

381
00:27:09,386 --> 00:27:10,226

382
00:27:11,786 --> 00:27:12,626
Muxia.

383
00:27:12,987 --> 00:27:14,507
May you grow up healthy.

384
00:27:15,786 --> 00:27:17,027
Your father

385
00:27:17,626 --> 00:27:19,427
will surely watch over you.

386
00:28:12,507 --> 00:28:13,347
Careful!

387
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:16,346
Slow down!

388
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:27,267
Soldiers fight on the battlefield

389
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:29,427
for this peaceful life.

390
00:28:30,386 --> 00:28:31,306
If Yan He

391
00:28:31,546 --> 00:28:32,386
could see this,

392
00:28:33,027 --> 00:28:34,427
he might rest in peace.

393
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:36,587
Sadly,

394
00:28:37,187 --> 00:28:38,187
he and Chengxiu

395
00:28:38,947 --> 00:28:40,187
are already separated by death.

396
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:43,827
Huaijin,

397
00:28:44,626 --> 00:28:45,507
we promised each other

398
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:47,067
to face the future

399
00:28:47,427 --> 00:28:48,947
and cherish every single day.

400
00:28:49,626 --> 00:28:50,466
Even if eventually...

401
00:28:50,546 --> 00:28:51,907
Even if one of us dies in battle,

402
00:28:52,786 --> 00:28:54,786
the other one must keep living
courageously

403
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,106
to see our nation's splendor and peace.

404
00:29:02,244 --> 00:29:05,872
(General Feihong's Mansion)

405
00:29:08,427 --> 00:29:09,826
This road feels too short.

406
00:29:10,306 --> 00:29:12,107
If only we could walk longer together.

407
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:13,466
We have time.

408
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,667
I'll always stay with you.

409
00:29:19,267 --> 00:29:20,626
We live together when we're alive.

410
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:22,267
After death, we'll be

411
00:29:22,987 --> 00:29:23,827
buried together.

412
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:28,346
I'll give you a spot beside me.

413
00:29:31,546 --> 00:29:32,786
Who asked you to do that?

414
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:35,467
I'm the renowned General Feihong!

415
00:29:39,507 --> 00:29:40,347
Well,

416
00:29:41,467 --> 00:29:42,786
you keep a spot for me?

417
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:44,787
You wish.

419
00:29:59,707 --> 00:30:00,547
Excuse me,

420
00:30:00,747 --> 00:30:01,707
if I may interject?

421
00:30:04,947 --> 00:30:06,106
Stop talking

422
00:30:06,267 --> 00:30:07,227
about the spot.

423
00:30:07,786 --> 00:30:08,907
An imperial edict arrived.

424
00:30:09,027 --> 00:30:09,867
Come and take it.

425
00:30:14,586 --> 00:30:18,267
(General Feihong's Mansion)
By Heaven's Mandate,

426
00:30:18,707 --> 00:30:21,187
Xiao Jue, General Fengyun,

427
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:25,106

is a heroine
of unmatched talent and brilliance.

Both are loyal generals

431
00:30:34,346 --> 00:30:35,987

432
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:38,507
I hereby grant you marriage.

433
00:30:38,747 --> 00:30:41,427
May you two stay together happily

434
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:45,187
and guard borders and people together.

435
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,306
That's all!

436
00:30:50,146 --> 00:30:51,866
