=Legend of The Female General=

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,856
(Xianchang Academy)

23
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:53,653
Today

24
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,653
(Year 14 of Qingyuan, Wei, Xianchang Academy)
marks your first enrollment.

25
00:01:57,172 --> 00:01:57,933
I know

26
00:01:58,732 --> 00:02:00,133
you come from privileged families

27
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:03,732
and have lived in comfort till now.

28
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:06,013
But at Xianchang Academy,

29
00:02:06,732 --> 00:02:08,773
you must study diligently

30
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:09,933
day and night

31
00:02:10,372 --> 00:02:12,332
to refine your talents
through perseverance

32
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,293
and serve our nation well.

33
00:02:15,884 --> 00:02:18,452
(Master Wei,
Scholar of Xianchang Academy)

34
00:02:18,452 --> 00:02:19,293
Young man,

35
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:20,732
what's your name?

36
00:02:21,253 --> 00:02:22,652
Why do you keep wearing a mask?

37
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:25,973
Constantly hiding your true appearance

38
00:02:26,492 --> 00:02:27,892
is rather rude, don't you think?

39
00:02:32,772 --> 00:02:33,413
Master,

40
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,013
I am He Rufei.

41
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:37,652
My visage is unsightly,

42
00:02:38,093 --> 00:02:39,413
and I fear startling others.

43
00:02:39,853 --> 00:02:41,452
So I cannot remove this mask.

44
00:02:48,932 --> 00:02:50,212
He's the Xiaos' second son?

45
00:02:51,013 --> 00:02:52,253
His exceptionalness lives up

46
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:53,293
to his reputation!

47
00:02:53,772 --> 00:02:54,452
Indeed.

48
00:03:02,413 --> 00:03:04,133
I, Xiao Jue, apologize for being late.

49
00:03:04,772 --> 00:03:05,732
Please forgive me.

50
00:03:08,844 --> 00:03:11,864
=Episode 2=

51
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:38,973
(Cheng Lisu,
Imperial Medical Bureau's Top Disciple)

52
00:03:38,973 --> 00:03:40,052
The army doesn't tolerate

53
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:41,212
flashy things,

54
00:03:42,332 --> 00:03:42,892
including you.

55
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:50,573
I traveled so far to join you.

56
00:03:50,848 --> 00:03:51,768
You treat me like this?

57
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:54,013
You can go back
for your arranged marriage.

58
00:03:55,973 --> 00:03:56,892
If I could beat you,

59
00:03:57,332 --> 00:03:57,892
I'd have...

60
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,533
beaten you senseless.

61
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:04,373
Feinu, escort Mr. Cheng out.

62
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:06,552
Understood.

63
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:08,172
Would you really

64
00:04:08,172 --> 00:04:09,052
abandon your friend

65
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:09,853
in need?

66
00:04:10,413 --> 00:04:11,332
Avoiding marriage

67
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,013
won't kill you.

68
00:04:14,328 --> 00:04:15,448
At worst, they'll maim you.

69
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:16,373
Xiao Jue.

70
00:04:17,013 --> 00:04:17,533
Commander.

71
00:04:19,413 --> 00:04:20,332
Uncle.

72
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:22,293
We're about the same age.

73
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:24,212
But you're still my maternal uncle.

74
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:25,612
Please let me stay.

75
00:04:26,652 --> 00:04:27,288
Okay?

76
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:37,092
Thank you.

77
00:04:53,852 --> 00:04:55,493
(If you enlist as a woman,)

78
00:04:55,972 --> 00:04:57,133
(it will remain a liability.)

79
00:04:57,972 --> 00:04:58,813
(So I have prepared)

80
00:04:59,133 --> 00:04:59,772
(for you)

81
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:00,972
(male identity papers)

82
00:05:01,452 --> 00:05:02,332
(of He Yan.)

83
00:05:04,984 --> 00:05:07,133
(He Yan's Household Register)

84
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:08,013
You're He Yan, right?

85
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:10,892
(Two names are different)

86
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:12,053
(in one character.)

87
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:14,373
(Master's foresight is thoughtful.)

88
00:05:15,493 --> 00:05:16,813
To the left tent for screening.

89
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:18,652
Then to the right tent if you pass

90
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,332
to register

91
00:05:19,493 --> 00:05:20,412
for uniforms and money.

92
00:05:21,144 --> 00:05:21,848
Thank you.

93
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:22,573
Next.

94
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:26,173
Commander, what's screening?

95
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:28,092
Don't know what screening is?

96
00:05:28,573 --> 00:05:29,133
It's simple.

97
00:05:29,532 --> 00:05:30,972
Strip naked for the medic's exam.

98
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:32,212
If you're healthy,

99
00:05:32,253 --> 00:05:32,852
you'll pass.

100
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:34,733
- Thanks.
- Next.

101
00:05:40,652 --> 00:05:41,852
The Gaoxia horse struggles

102
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:43,332
with the climate.

103
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:44,892
It hasn't eaten.

104
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:46,332
Examine it.

105
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:47,573
See what ails it.

106
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:48,452
What?

107
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:50,693
I, a future imperial physician,

108
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:51,693
am treating a horse?

109
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:52,933
As a healer,

110
00:05:53,532 --> 00:05:55,092
shouldn't you treat all lives equally?

111
00:05:56,053 --> 00:05:58,373
Besides, Yezhou Garrison
keeps no idlers.

112
00:05:58,933 --> 00:05:59,733
If you want to stay,

113
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:01,613
be useful.

114
00:06:11,573 --> 00:06:12,693
Fortunately, this is a mare.

115
00:06:13,212 --> 00:06:14,452
Helping it is acceptable.

116
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:15,693
I'd have declined

117
00:06:15,813 --> 00:06:16,813
if it were a stallion.

118
00:06:17,972 --> 00:06:19,493
Xiao Jue, watch closely.

119
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:20,852
I can both heal

120
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:21,933
and tame horses.

121
00:06:35,412 --> 00:06:36,053
Look!

122
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:37,373
It's spooked!

123
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:38,373
It's coming!

124
00:06:51,772 --> 00:06:52,408
Make way!

125
00:06:52,772 --> 00:06:53,532
Move aside! Move!

126
00:06:56,173 --> 00:06:56,772
Move aside!

127
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,452
That man's way of taming

128
00:07:43,652 --> 00:07:45,013
is unique to the Fuyue Army.

129
00:07:45,772 --> 00:07:46,772
He's He Rufei's man?

130
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:52,412
(No, I accidentally gave myself away.)

131
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:53,933
(Xiao Jue noticed it.)

132
00:07:54,813 --> 00:07:55,332
Not bad.

133
00:07:55,813 --> 00:07:57,292
He resembles my heroics in the past.

134
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:01,892
That move he just pulled

135
00:08:02,772 --> 00:08:03,933
is way beyond your skills.

136
00:08:24,373 --> 00:08:24,892
(Oh no.)

137
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:27,053
(Xiao Jue knows Fuyue Army's moves.)

138
00:08:27,892 --> 00:08:29,092
(He definitely recognized it.)

139
00:08:29,452 --> 00:08:30,452
(Yet he didn't react.)

140
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:32,532
(He took me)

141
00:08:32,573 --> 00:08:33,532
(as He Rufei's man)

142
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:35,613
(and planned to act against me?)

143
00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:39,532
Come on.

144
00:08:39,772 --> 00:08:40,412
Let's continue.

145
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:42,172
Gather around!

146
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:47,532
Impressive.

147
00:08:47,932 --> 00:08:48,572
You're small.

148
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:49,532
But you're quite good.

149
00:08:49,772 --> 00:08:50,412
You flatter me.

150
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:51,853
My taming skills could

151
00:08:52,052 --> 00:08:53,412
never match yours, Instructor.

152
00:08:54,936 --> 00:08:55,608
Well...

153
00:08:57,253 --> 00:08:58,013
The army needs

154
00:08:58,013 --> 00:08:58,892
talents like you.

155
00:09:00,493 --> 00:09:01,172
But

156
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:03,093
I haven't been screened yet.

157
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,093
Forget about it.

158
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:05,453
If you can tame such a horse,

159
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:06,733
your physique must be good.

160
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:07,800
I'll secure the horse.

161
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,368
Then let's handle the documents. Wait.

162
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:10,613
- Go.
- Thank you.

163
00:09:11,412 --> 00:09:12,253
So naughty.

164
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:13,613
Turn and slash!

165
00:09:14,892 --> 00:09:15,812
Since you suspect him,

166
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:17,133
why not kill him directly

167
00:09:17,253 --> 00:09:17,812
for good?

168
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,772
If he's truly a spy sent

169
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:20,733
by the ill-intended one,

170
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:22,013
killing one will

171
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:23,733
only bring replacements.

172
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:26,052
Rather than endless trouble,

173
00:09:26,412 --> 00:09:27,333
it's better to keep him

174
00:09:28,052 --> 00:09:29,613
to potentially lure out the mastermind.

175
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:31,373
I wonder

176
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:32,973
whether the mastermind is He Rufei

177
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:33,772
or Xu Jingfu.

178
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,133
You said

179
00:09:35,613 --> 00:09:36,812
before your father's campaign,

180
00:09:37,172 --> 00:09:38,652
he impeached the prime minister.

181
00:09:39,572 --> 00:09:40,373
Within days,

182
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:41,532
he fell into an ambush

183
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:42,412
at Mingshui.

184
00:09:42,853 --> 00:09:43,932
He Rufei's troops

185
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:45,213
were a hundred li away,

186
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:46,812
but arrived only

187
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,253
on day seven after your father

188
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:49,052
sent the letter.

189
00:09:49,772 --> 00:09:50,692
It was intentional.

190
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:51,892
I think

191
00:09:52,373 --> 00:09:53,613
they are birds of a feather.

192
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,532
But we lack concrete evidence.

193
00:09:57,373 --> 00:09:58,253
We can't prove

194
00:09:58,253 --> 00:09:59,292
the defeat at Mingshui

195
00:09:59,572 --> 00:10:01,253
relates to Xu Jingfu and He Rufei.

196
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:02,733
Nor can we prove

197
00:10:03,373 --> 00:10:05,013
their collusion.

198
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,133
Now the Xiao Army is weakened

199
00:10:08,812 --> 00:10:09,932
and disliked by His Majesty.

200
00:10:10,812 --> 00:10:12,172
We can only investigate covertly.

201
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:14,333
With troop shortages here

202
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,172
and low funds,

203
00:10:16,373 --> 00:10:17,772
building a competent new army

204
00:10:18,772 --> 00:10:19,652
is highly challenging.

205
00:10:25,493 --> 00:10:27,052
Investigate that man thoroughly.

206
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:28,613
I want to know

207
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:29,652
whose pawn he is.

208
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:31,652
Understood.

209
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,717
(Xu Mansion)

210
00:10:53,548 --> 00:10:56,600
(Chu Zhao, Disciple of Xu Jingfu)

211
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:06,424
Master.

212
00:11:08,253 --> 00:11:09,532
Regarding the Que City mission,

213
00:11:10,373 --> 00:11:11,532
you've worked hard.

214
00:11:13,013 --> 00:11:13,692
As ordered,

215
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,692
I monitored Xiao Jue in Que City.

216
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:17,692
The battle was unwinnable,

217
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:19,292
yet no one anticipated

218
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:20,652
his ruthless tactic

219
00:11:20,772 --> 00:11:21,932
of flooding Que City

220
00:11:22,253 --> 00:11:23,493
to force a reversal.

221
00:11:24,532 --> 00:11:25,172
Pity

222
00:11:26,973 --> 00:11:28,532
those countless lost souls.

223
00:11:30,213 --> 00:11:30,772
Zilan,

224
00:11:31,013 --> 00:11:32,292
ensure that Xiao Jue's

225
00:11:32,453 --> 00:11:33,932
flooding of Que City

226
00:11:34,172 --> 00:11:37,052
and mass slaughter of tens of thousands

227
00:11:37,772 --> 00:11:39,133
are publicly exposed

228
00:11:39,373 --> 00:11:42,213
to expose his infamy to the world.

229
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,652
His Majesty's wariness

230
00:11:44,213 --> 00:11:46,373
toward him will grow even deeper.

231
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:50,613
Though victorious,

232
00:11:51,172 --> 00:11:53,052
he was promoted in name
but demoted in reality.

233
00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:55,333
He was sent to Yezhou Garrison.

234
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:58,692
Even with his conscription rights
restored,

235
00:11:58,812 --> 00:12:00,453
that desolate wasteland

236
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:02,652
could never yield decent soldiers.

237
00:12:03,572 --> 00:12:04,213
Moreover,

238
00:12:05,052 --> 00:12:06,172
I discovered in Que City

239
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:08,213
a fish that slipped through the net.

240
00:12:10,172 --> 00:12:11,973
I've positioned him as a hidden pawn

241
00:12:12,172 --> 00:12:12,973
in our strategy.

242
00:12:13,292 --> 00:12:14,133
Given time,

243
00:12:14,572 --> 00:12:16,892
he'll become an unstoppable vanguard.

244
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:19,853
Great.

245
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:22,373
Focus on recovering these coming days.

246
00:12:23,052 --> 00:12:23,772
Soon,

247
00:12:24,213 --> 00:12:25,892
you'll be entrusted

248
00:12:25,932 --> 00:12:26,733
with greater tasks.

249
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:27,772
Understood.

250
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:29,133
Chu Zhao.

251
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:38,013
(Xu Pingting, Daughter of Xu Jingfu)
You're back! Did you bring me a gift?

252
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,853
Your impudence grows by the day.

253
00:12:42,692 --> 00:12:43,384
Father.

254
00:12:44,692 --> 00:12:45,493
I'd never forget.

255
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:52,692
What fragrance is this?

256
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:54,213
Try it to find out.

257
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:56,013
Try it with me.

258
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,093
Go ahead.

259
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:04,093
Then I'll graciously accept.

260
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:05,528
Let's go.

261
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,932
What's wrong with this tinderbox?

262
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:26,133
Let me try.

263
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:33,493
Stop it.

264
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:35,532
Light it with the candle.

265
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,253
Burn him! Burn him!

266
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,292
(Burn him!)

267
00:13:54,253 --> 00:13:54,812
Let me see.

268
00:13:57,572 --> 00:13:58,292
You're injured.

269
00:14:01,853 --> 00:14:02,453
Are you okay?

270
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:03,932
It's nothing.

271
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:05,932
Just got burned.

272
00:14:06,932 --> 00:14:07,572
My grip slipped.

273
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:29,172
Young Master,

274
00:14:30,013 --> 00:14:30,652
your injury...

275
00:14:37,172 --> 00:14:38,892
(Yingxiang, Chu Zhao's maid)
I know you wounded your left arm

276
00:14:38,932 --> 00:14:39,812
intentionally.

277
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:40,692
But...

278
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,373
I've failed my duties.

279
00:14:43,373 --> 00:14:44,772
And I was also injured by refugees.

280
00:14:45,853 --> 00:14:47,892
I feel ashamed, Master.

281
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:50,973
You're being too harsh with yourself.

282
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,692
To earn Master's favor,

283
00:14:56,093 --> 00:14:57,532
sacrifices must be made.

284
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:36,412
(A bandit?)

285
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:39,416
(Wang Ba, Yezhou Garrison recruit)

286
00:15:40,892 --> 00:15:41,613
Move!

287
00:15:42,347 --> 00:15:44,248
(Zheng Xuan, Yezhou Garrison recruit)

288
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:48,248
(Face-tattooing punishment?)

289
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:49,853
(He was a convict)

290
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:51,052
(and a rogue.)

291
00:15:51,052 --> 00:15:51,812
Boss, your tea.

292
00:15:53,572 --> 00:15:54,333
Well-mannered.

293
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:55,652
It's tiring.

294
00:16:00,587 --> 00:16:03,160
(Jiang Jiao, Yezhou Garrison recruit)

295
00:16:03,436 --> 00:16:05,432
(Escort Agency)

296
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:07,480
(Former escort agency member?)

297
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:08,572
(He must be skilled.)

298
00:16:09,412 --> 00:16:10,133
Look away!

299
00:16:10,692 --> 00:16:11,493
Pretty boy.

300
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:12,892
(Paler than me.)

301
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:14,333
(How dare he judge me?)

302
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:19,013
I used to think

303
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:20,373
(Mai, Yezhou Garrison recruit)
I was the shortest one here

304
00:16:20,572 --> 00:16:21,493
in the camp.

305
00:16:21,892 --> 00:16:22,493
But now

306
00:16:22,892 --> 00:16:24,133
you're almost as short as me.

307
00:16:24,772 --> 00:16:25,304
Alright.

308
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:26,652
We together eat more

309
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:27,572
to grow taller.

310
00:16:27,692 --> 00:16:30,093
By the way, what's your name?

311
00:16:30,493 --> 00:16:31,093
He Yan.

312
00:16:31,812 --> 00:16:34,133
Then I'll call you He.

313
00:16:34,572 --> 00:16:35,256
Agreed.

314
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:36,493
I'm Mai.

315
00:16:37,973 --> 00:16:38,812
I was a farmer.

316
00:16:39,013 --> 00:16:39,572
Sleep here.

317
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:43,224
(Huang Xiong, Yezhou Garrison recruit)

318
00:16:44,373 --> 00:16:46,013
(This one was a hunter.)

319
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:48,733
(A killer wearing prayer beads.)

320
00:16:49,052 --> 00:16:49,853
(Interesting.)

321
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:51,253
Thanks.

322
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:54,692
He,

323
00:16:56,453 --> 00:16:57,892
you'll sleep here tonight.

324
00:16:58,292 --> 00:16:59,333
- Okay.
- Let me help.

325
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:00,493
No need.

326
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:33,132
You claim hostility with Xiao Jue,

327
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:34,132
yet you know

328
00:17:34,572 --> 00:17:35,453
the Que City battle

329
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:37,132
left his reputation in ruins.

330
00:17:37,572 --> 00:17:38,372
Aren't you afraid

331
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:40,733
to be implicated by him

332
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:41,893
or slandered?

333
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:43,372
Master,

334
00:17:44,253 --> 00:17:44,973
I don't believe

335
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:47,292
Xiao Jue would flood Que City

336
00:17:47,572 --> 00:17:48,852
just for an easy victory.

337
00:17:49,132 --> 00:17:49,772
Nor would he

338
00:17:50,213 --> 00:17:51,973
sacrifice all the people of Que City

339
00:17:52,132 --> 00:17:53,132
as stepping stones

340
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:55,292
to pave his path to military glory.

341
00:17:56,413 --> 00:17:57,332
Most importantly,

342
00:17:57,693 --> 00:18:00,653
the Xiao Army urgently needs
new recruits right now.

343
00:18:01,772 --> 00:18:04,572
This way I can stand out quicker

344
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:06,292
and prove myself.

345
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,413
(The snoring chorus is impressive.)

346
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:20,213
(I last heard this long ago.)

347
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:43,893
He,

348
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:45,612
you're up so early.

349
00:18:47,812 --> 00:18:48,372
Nature called.

350
00:18:53,812 --> 00:18:54,453
Mr. Shen.

351
00:18:55,812 --> 00:18:56,852
- Mr. Shen.
- Mr. Shen.

352
00:18:57,292 --> 00:19:00,184
(Shen Han,
Head Instructor of Yezhou Garrison)

353
00:19:08,173 --> 00:19:10,052
What guy...

354
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:12,092
Mr. Shen.

355
00:19:18,493 --> 00:19:19,693
Good morning, Commander.

356
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:20,453
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

357
00:19:20,453 --> 00:19:21,016
Good morning.

358
00:19:29,973 --> 00:19:30,772
Up already?

359
00:19:31,893 --> 00:19:33,772
He woke up
from nature's call, Commander.

360
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:43,893
Everyone!

361
00:19:44,532 --> 00:19:45,693
Gather at the training field

362
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:48,213
and have ten weighted laps
around the barracks!

363
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:50,292
Not a single lap less.

364
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:51,653
Wait, ten...

365
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:52,933
Ten laps?

366
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:54,413
Why?

367
00:20:02,052 --> 00:20:03,653
It was all because of you!

368
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:06,733
You had to be an early riser

369
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:09,413
with no team spirit!

370
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:11,372
- Selfish worm!
- Yes, selfish.

371
00:20:11,893 --> 00:20:13,253
Go home if you want to sleep in.

372
00:20:13,852 --> 00:20:14,653
We're in the army.

373
00:20:15,253 --> 00:20:15,893
You...

374
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:17,572
Boss! Boss!

375
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:19,052
If you don't get out now,

376
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:20,173
you'll be punished harder.

377
00:20:20,812 --> 00:20:21,893
Don't be mad.

378
00:20:22,092 --> 00:20:23,173
Stay calm.

379
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:27,532
He,

380
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:28,852
I'm afraid I won't

381
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:30,092
keep up with the training.

382
00:20:30,332 --> 00:20:30,840
Don't worry.

383
00:20:31,173 --> 00:20:31,852
Recruit training

384
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:32,852
is always gradual.

385
00:20:32,973 --> 00:20:34,013
Day One will be simple.

386
00:20:39,493 --> 00:20:40,253
I can't go on.

387
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,132
I can't go on. I really can't.

388
00:20:47,332 --> 00:20:47,933
On your feet!

389
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:50,052
Five more laps!

390
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:56,253
Come on, He.

391
00:20:56,772 --> 00:20:57,572
I'll count to three.

392
00:20:57,693 --> 00:20:58,812
Two, three!

393
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:00,532
Watch it.

394
00:21:00,933 --> 00:21:01,572
One, two, three.

395
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:02,612
Let's go.

396
00:21:08,173 --> 00:21:08,852
(I didn't know)

397
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:10,332
(how Xiao Jue trained his men.)

398
00:21:11,213 --> 00:21:12,772
(I have finally seen it now.)

399
00:21:14,092 --> 00:21:15,852
(It starts so intense right away.)

400
00:21:19,132 --> 00:21:19,733
(Xiao Jue)

401
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:21,572
(has such a pretty face,)

402
00:21:22,173 --> 00:21:23,253
(but he's truly vicious,)

403
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:24,612
(just like before.)

404
00:21:26,213 --> 00:21:27,532
(I thought I could earn merits)

405
00:21:27,893 --> 00:21:28,733
(and rise quickly.)

406
00:21:29,532 --> 00:21:30,213
(But Xiao Jue)

407
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:31,173
(is hard on others)

408
00:21:31,572 --> 00:21:32,572
(and harder on himself.)

409
00:21:36,132 --> 00:21:38,013
(It seems serving under him won't)

410
00:21:38,612 --> 00:21:39,292
(let me rise)

411
00:21:39,893 --> 00:21:40,852
(as easily as I hoped.)

412
00:21:44,572 --> 00:21:46,292
(Severely injured and then poisoned,)

413
00:21:46,893 --> 00:21:47,893
(in bed for a month.)

414
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,772
(It nearly drained all my strength.)

415
00:21:50,532 --> 00:21:51,733
(I can't go on like this.)

416
00:21:57,013 --> 00:21:58,733
Commander, it's only the first day.

417
00:21:59,532 --> 00:22:01,052
Aren't you pushing them too hard?

418
00:22:01,693 --> 00:22:02,372
Mr. Shen,

419
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:03,893
these recruits

420
00:22:04,092 --> 00:22:05,292
are either country folk

421
00:22:05,453 --> 00:22:06,532
or bandits and thugs.

422
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:08,253
Like with that horse,

423
00:22:08,812 --> 00:22:10,493
the Commander's harsh methods

424
00:22:10,772 --> 00:22:11,413
aren't about

425
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,413
breaking their spirit.

426
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:14,612
He's testing their potential.

427
00:22:15,612 --> 00:22:16,453
Mr. Cheng, you know

428
00:22:16,453 --> 00:22:17,213
our Commander well.

429
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:21,493
Isn't he the horse-taming prodigy

430
00:22:21,493 --> 00:22:22,413
from yesterday?

431
00:22:22,973 --> 00:22:23,772
Why is everyone else

432
00:22:23,772 --> 00:22:24,893
on their seventh lap

433
00:22:25,253 --> 00:22:26,493
while he started his fourth?

434
00:22:27,092 --> 00:22:28,132
In my opinion,

435
00:22:28,453 --> 00:22:29,612
he's lacking in potential.

436
00:22:29,653 --> 00:22:30,173
Don't speak

437
00:22:30,173 --> 00:22:31,053
of my savior that way.

438
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:32,013
So what if he is?

439
00:22:32,532 --> 00:22:33,332
He could still

440
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:34,852
make a good army cook.

441
00:22:36,013 --> 00:22:36,812
Army cook?

442
00:22:37,973 --> 00:22:38,893
You underestimate him.

443
00:22:41,013 --> 00:22:41,733
I actually think

444
00:22:42,733 --> 00:22:43,413
he's perfect

445
00:22:43,413 --> 00:22:44,733
scout material.

446
00:22:55,052 --> 00:22:57,733
Now we'll learn to use various weapons.

447
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:04,893
I can barely stand.

448
00:23:17,332 --> 00:23:17,973
He,

449
00:23:18,493 --> 00:23:19,893
why is your sword so short?

450
00:23:20,413 --> 00:23:21,653
It's not even arm's length.

451
00:23:22,572 --> 00:23:23,493
It's twin blades.

452
00:23:23,973 --> 00:23:24,612
Not a sword,

453
00:23:25,092 --> 00:23:25,852
but a pair.

454
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:28,052
W-What twin blades?

455
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:30,173
Real men use this.

456
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:32,292
So flashy.

457
00:23:32,332 --> 00:23:32,893
Exactly.

458
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:34,572
Sounds like useless decoration.

459
00:24:03,213 --> 00:24:04,653
- Good.
- Not bad.

460
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:05,532
He's got skills.

461
00:24:11,413 --> 00:24:12,653
That should be one technique.

462
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,173
That's sad.

463
00:24:14,772 --> 00:24:15,733
He can't fight properly.

464
00:24:20,453 --> 00:24:21,812
I'm exhausted. Need a break.

465
00:24:35,493 --> 00:24:36,173
He's decent.

466
00:24:38,173 --> 00:24:39,253
- Good!
- Good!

467
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:40,453
(Lei Hou, Yezhou Garrison recruit)
Impressive!

468
00:24:46,173 --> 00:24:47,332
- Good!
- Good!

469
00:24:50,253 --> 00:24:51,092
That's real skill.

470
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:59,013
A-Are you staring or fighting?

471
00:24:59,893 --> 00:25:01,052
Move back. My turn first.

472
00:25:19,532 --> 00:25:20,173
Impressive!

473
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:21,292
- Amazing!
- Amazing!

474
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:25,253
Your turn.

475
00:25:26,572 --> 00:25:27,372
Hurry up.

476
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:35,493
We're on the clock here.

477
00:25:46,052 --> 00:25:46,852
Draw it back.

478
00:25:47,052 --> 00:25:47,852
Come on.

479
00:25:50,772 --> 00:25:51,292
No need.

480
00:25:51,852 --> 00:25:52,372
I can't pull

481
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:53,453
this bow.

482
00:25:57,772 --> 00:25:59,292
His stance looked decent.

483
00:26:02,493 --> 00:26:04,132
This bow requires real strength.

484
00:26:05,532 --> 00:26:06,532
We can't blame He Yan.

485
00:26:12,253 --> 00:26:12,812
He,

486
00:26:13,413 --> 00:26:14,413
he excels at everything.

487
00:26:14,772 --> 00:26:15,812
We need to work harder.

488
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:28,024
Block!

489
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:33,464
Retract!

490
00:26:36,413 --> 00:26:36,933
Again.

491
00:26:37,493 --> 00:26:38,072
Strike!

492
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:40,856
Thrust!

493
00:26:44,132 --> 00:26:44,696
Block!

494
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:48,216
Retract!

495
00:26:49,653 --> 00:26:50,292
Again.

496
00:26:51,132 --> 00:26:51,768
Strike!

497
00:26:53,453 --> 00:26:54,072
Thrust!

498
00:26:55,453 --> 00:26:56,184
Block!

499
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:21,013
What's funny?

500
00:27:22,453 --> 00:27:23,893
Pick it up. Keep going.

501
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,612
A pretty face with nothing.

502
00:27:29,933 --> 00:27:30,812
All show, no skill.

503
00:27:31,453 --> 00:27:32,088
Retract!

504
00:27:36,253 --> 00:27:37,092
Regardless,

505
00:27:37,332 --> 00:27:38,453
he picked up the spear.

506
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:39,852
That's commendable.

507
00:27:43,332 --> 00:27:44,772
What did you find about He Yan?

508
00:27:45,253 --> 00:27:46,532
He's from a gatekeeper's family

509
00:27:46,572 --> 00:27:47,132
in Jiazhou.

510
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:48,852
No prior military history.

511
00:27:49,653 --> 00:27:51,213
No suspicious family connections.

512
00:27:51,933 --> 00:27:52,532
Currently,

513
00:27:53,052 --> 00:27:54,092
his background checks out.

514
00:27:56,812 --> 00:27:58,253
Yet he's skilled in horsemanship

515
00:27:58,852 --> 00:28:00,733
and knows military routines well.

516
00:28:01,693 --> 00:28:02,733
He's clearly a seasoned

517
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:03,413
soldier.

518
00:28:04,092 --> 00:28:04,852
But during drills,

519
00:28:05,653 --> 00:28:06,812
he performs pathetically.

520
00:28:07,893 --> 00:28:09,292
I'm quite curious.

521
00:28:10,653 --> 00:28:11,572
Is he faking it

522
00:28:12,453 --> 00:28:13,772
or truly useless?

523
00:28:17,772 --> 00:28:18,453
The others?

524
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,640
Commander,

525
00:28:20,253 --> 00:28:21,653
recruits have diverse backgrounds.

526
00:28:22,092 --> 00:28:22,812
Some have

527
00:28:22,812 --> 00:28:23,372
dubious pasts.

528
00:28:23,852 --> 00:28:25,016
But the only one who faked it

529
00:28:25,772 --> 00:28:26,413
is this person.

530
00:28:36,532 --> 00:28:37,852
Send two teams from Mingshui.

531
00:28:38,413 --> 00:28:39,292
One to Jiazhou

532
00:28:39,812 --> 00:28:41,213
and one to Que City.

533
00:28:42,493 --> 00:28:44,092
Investigate this impostor thoroughly.

534
00:28:45,213 --> 00:28:45,772
The rest

535
00:28:47,173 --> 00:28:48,612
continue investigating in Mingshui.

536
00:28:49,572 --> 00:28:50,328
As you command.

537
00:28:55,307 --> 00:28:58,680
(Longevity of Cranes and Pines)

538
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:08,248
(Song Wan, Xiao Jue's Mother)

539
00:30:12,213 --> 00:30:13,013
What's that smell?

540
00:30:16,092 --> 00:30:16,933
It seems to be

541
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:18,173
from the mountain pass.

542
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:22,852
The smell of sulfur?

543
00:30:24,893 --> 00:30:25,733
A hot spring?

544
00:30:56,532 --> 00:30:57,332
(But, Sister,)

545
00:30:57,733 --> 00:30:59,092
(the achievements you have today)

546
00:30:59,772 --> 00:31:00,572
are entirely due to

547
00:31:00,852 --> 00:31:03,332
your identity
as the He family's legitimate heir.

548
00:31:03,893 --> 00:31:05,372
(Even with the name He Rufei,)

549
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,372
as a woman,

550
00:31:08,213 --> 00:31:08,973
how could you

551
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:11,332
(achieve such accomplishments
and reputation?)

552
00:31:14,213 --> 00:31:15,213
(Those were all earned)

553
00:31:15,213 --> 00:31:16,893
(through my pain, blood, and tears.)

554
00:31:18,772 --> 00:31:20,132
(The He family's heir)

555
00:31:21,453 --> 00:31:23,413
(are just empty words.)

556
00:31:25,332 --> 00:31:25,973
(What's mine)

557
00:31:27,213 --> 00:31:28,213
(can't be taken away.)

558
00:31:43,772 --> 00:31:44,852
Only months have passed.

559
00:31:45,933 --> 00:31:47,453
But it feels like a lifetime ago.

560
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:51,493
In my past life, I hid in shadows.

561
00:31:52,733 --> 00:31:54,693
Only the moon saw my true face.

562
00:31:57,132 --> 00:31:58,052
In this life,

563
00:31:59,693 --> 00:32:00,933
I can finally

564
00:32:02,013 --> 00:32:04,092
fight with honor.

565
00:32:10,253 --> 00:32:11,332
(With this hot spring)

566
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,013
(and proper training,)

567
00:32:14,013 --> 00:32:15,213
(I should recover completely)

568
00:32:15,413 --> 00:32:16,213
(in a few days.)
