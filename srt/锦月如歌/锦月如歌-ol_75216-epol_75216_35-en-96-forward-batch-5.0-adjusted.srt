(Xiao Zhongwu, Song Wan)
Father, Mother.

24
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,139
I cannot abandon the Xiao Army.

25
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:56,699
Nor can I be her obstacle.

26
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:01,338
If we're not destined to be a couple,

27
00:02:05,178 --> 00:02:06,258
then I'd rather be

28
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:08,939
single and alone.

00:02:12,803 --> 00:02:18,448
(Virtues' Enduring Legacy)

30
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:23,379
Your Majesty.

31
00:02:23,498 --> 00:02:24,338
Shall I

32
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:25,819
change it with fresh flowers?

33
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,898
I ruined Xiao Jue and He Yan's marriage.

34
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,498
They

35
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:43,218
must hold resentment toward me.

36
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:44,979
I suppose

37
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:47,618
you have your reasons, Your Majesty.

38
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,299
The imperial court requires

39
00:02:51,618 --> 00:02:54,058
a balance.

40
00:02:55,178 --> 00:02:56,018
But now,

41
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,458
two powerful generals

42
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:01,099
seek to unite.

43
00:03:02,338 --> 00:03:03,218
How could I

44
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,778
rest easy with this?

45
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,898
Their grievances were predictable.

46
00:03:14,658 --> 00:03:15,738
Since that's the case,

47
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,219
I shall

48
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:22,299
make their division

49
00:03:23,058 --> 00:03:24,738
more absolute.

50
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:31,099
Your Majesty,

51
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:33,139
General Fengyun requests an audience.

52
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:46,064
(Xiao Mansion)

53
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:49,338
Your wedding gown
was rushed to completion.

54
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:50,299
It just arrived.

55
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:52,658
Quickly try it on.

56
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:53,898
If it doesn't fit,

57
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:54,778
we'll alter it.

58
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:57,379
Come on.

59
00:03:58,178 --> 00:03:59,018
Come.

60
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:02,498
The embroidery and fabric

61
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:03,618
are truly first-rate.

62
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:05,178
Huaijin is thoughtful.

63
00:04:10,938 --> 00:04:12,498
But this dress looks so complicated.

64
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:14,139
How do I wear it?

65
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:16,579
Don't worry.

66
00:04:16,618 --> 00:04:17,458
We'll help you.

67
00:04:17,618 --> 00:04:18,458
Go try it.

68
00:04:32,418 --> 00:04:33,619
Miss He looks stunning.

69
00:04:34,658 --> 00:04:36,019
Huaijin chose well.

70
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,778
In Yaojing, these past years,

71
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:38,978
no bride's gown

72
00:04:39,619 --> 00:04:40,459
could compare to

73
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:42,978
what you're wearing now.

74
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:46,819
Truly magnificent.

75
00:04:49,338 --> 00:04:50,178
Rongwei.

76
00:04:50,218 --> 00:04:51,058
Miss He.

77
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:52,419
Huaijin has returned.

78
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,418
Let him try his attire alone.

79
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:56,259
Right now,

80
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:58,858
he shouldn't see
the bride's full ensemble.

81
00:05:01,619 --> 00:05:03,139
He's returned with an imperial edict.

82
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,298
Xiao Jue.

83
00:05:21,619 --> 00:05:22,658
Is anything wrong?

84
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:25,858
He Yan, heed the decree.

85
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:35,059
His Majesty

86
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:36,899
decrees that

87
00:05:37,418 --> 00:05:38,258
He Yan,

88
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,338
a scholar and warrior,

89
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:40,658
has done great feats,

90
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:42,138
protecting Jiyang,

91
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:43,219
defending Rundu,

92
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:44,939
and repelling Wutuo.

93
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:46,658
For her contributions,

94
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:49,699
she is granted
the Mansion of General Feihong.

95
00:05:51,098 --> 00:05:53,579
May she continue
exceeding my expectations

96
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:55,139
with tireless dedication

97
00:05:55,858 --> 00:05:57,059
and loyalty.

98
00:06:04,218 --> 00:06:05,418
- Thank...
- Another edict.

99
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:20,579
General Feihong,

100
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,298
He Yan,

101
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:24,699
has noble character

102
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:26,259
and dual expertise.

103
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,978
Lord Shijin's son,

104
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:32,019
Chu Zhao, Vice Director

105
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:33,498
of the Secretariat,

106
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:35,338
has honorable bearing

107
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:37,939
and exceptional talent.

108
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:39,859
They are

109
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:42,298
a most fitting match.

110
00:06:43,338 --> 00:06:44,338
By imperial decree,

111
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,059
the two shall wed

112
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:49,338
(Imperial Edict)
on a day

113
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:50,979
of good fortune.

114
00:06:54,739 --> 00:06:55,699
That's all.

115
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,819
He Yan narrowly escaped death

116
00:07:01,498 --> 00:07:03,699
to reclaim the General Feihong title.

117
00:07:04,898 --> 00:07:06,098
Forcing her to abandon it

118
00:07:07,098 --> 00:07:07,939
would erase

119
00:07:08,418 --> 00:07:09,338
her very essence.

120
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:11,978
The Xiao Army

121
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:15,259
is my father's life's work

122
00:07:16,658 --> 00:07:18,059
and remains my duty.

123
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:20,298
Let me let go.

124
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:22,418
Then I

125
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:24,939
cannot remain myself.

126
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:28,138
It seems

127
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:30,699
you've made your choice.

128
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:34,059
You left me no other choice.

129
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:39,098
I shall have you perform another task.

130
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:41,019
This marriage decree.

131
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:44,019
You shall personally deliver.

132
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:54,178
No,

133
00:07:56,218 --> 00:07:57,058
I won't.

134
00:07:57,538 --> 00:07:58,619
You are defying my order?

135
00:08:06,098 --> 00:08:07,179
Please

136
00:08:08,499 --> 00:08:09,579
punish me.

137
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:10,539
You...

138
00:08:34,218 --> 00:08:35,418
Aren't you afraid of

139
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:38,019
dragging down your family?

140
00:08:50,619 --> 00:08:51,859
If that's your order,

141
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,459
I obey.

142
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:11,179
What did you say?

143
00:09:14,898 --> 00:09:16,259
Repeat that.

144
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:26,778
You broke plum branches

145
00:09:28,898 --> 00:09:30,298
and made bridal attire for me.

146
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:33,619
In the end,

147
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:37,859

00:13:25,898 --> 00:13:26,738
At ease.

195
00:13:27,298 --> 00:13:28,138
Perfect timing.

196
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:30,499
She wants me to retract my decree,

197
00:13:31,938 --> 00:13:33,499
but it's inappropriate.

198
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:35,579
Your Majesty,

199
00:13:36,178 --> 00:13:37,859
I will cherish He Yan wholeheartedly

200
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:40,019
and make her understand my sincerity.

201
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:41,099
Given time...

202
00:13:41,099 --> 00:13:42,099
This is unnecessary.

203
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:46,179
Your Majesty,

204
00:13:46,578 --> 00:13:47,418
I know

205
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:49,499
you just want to prevent

206
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:51,859
a marriage between two military leaders.

207
00:13:54,058 --> 00:13:55,658
I won't marry Xiao Jue.

208
00:13:58,418 --> 00:13:59,258
But

209
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:00,578
I won't marry Chu Zhao either.

210
00:14:01,898 --> 00:14:02,738
Outrageous!

211
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,019
Please calm your anger.

212
00:14:07,658 --> 00:14:08,498
I

213
00:14:08,698 --> 00:14:09,619
won't defy the decree,

214
00:14:11,979 --> 00:14:13,099
but I refuse to settle.

215
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,139
If I can't spend my life
with the one I love,

216
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:18,259
I would rather

217
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:20,139
remain alone forever.

218
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:25,698
Please grant me.

219
00:14:30,058 --> 00:14:30,898
Your Majesty,

220
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:34,938
if He Yan

221
00:14:35,698 --> 00:14:37,019
refuses to marry Chu Zhao,

222
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:40,619
I implore you

223
00:14:42,658 --> 00:14:43,979
to grant her

224
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,818
a choice.

225
00:14:58,538 --> 00:14:59,378
Fine.

226
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:04,219
Have it your way.

227
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:15,418
I shall

228
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:16,538
take my leave.

229
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:32,538
(Have I)

230
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:35,259
(truly erred?)

231
00:15:40,938 --> 00:15:41,898
Were you involved in

232
00:15:43,658 --> 00:15:44,658
this arranged marriage?

233
00:15:48,058 --> 00:15:48,898
Yes.

234
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:51,698
I requested it.

235
00:15:53,178 --> 00:15:55,979
But Xiao Jue still dumped you.

236
00:16:00,538 --> 00:16:01,859
You're an intelligent man.

237
00:16:02,859 --> 00:16:04,099
You should understand

238
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:06,538
that decree cannot constrain me.

239
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,339
We were never

240
00:16:10,058 --> 00:16:11,499
in the cards.

241
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:13,778
There's no future

242
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:15,619
for you two.

243
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:18,178
Why not turn your eyes to me?

244
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,298
Can you not tell

245
00:16:19,298 --> 00:16:20,658
my heart is as true as his?

246
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:21,778
That's not love.

247
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:24,979
It was all a calculated game.

248
00:16:29,538 --> 00:16:30,859
Should I cut open my heart?

249
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:33,219
Is a calculated heart any less worthy?

250
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:34,339
Tell me!

251
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:35,579
You're insane!

252
00:16:37,178 --> 00:16:38,859
How much ambition is hidden

253
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:42,698
behind the love you speak of?

254
00:16:43,298 --> 00:16:44,698
Was every single thing you did

255
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:47,139
truly only for me?

256
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:49,939
Stop deluding yourself, Chu Zhao.

257
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:52,459
I'm just

258
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:56,619
a pretty excuse for your ambition.

259
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,418
You know what?

260
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,778
You're becoming another Xu Jingfu.

261
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:15,504
(Chu Mansion)

262
00:18:17,058 --> 00:18:18,739
Miss Xu, your meal is served.

263
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:20,899
Chu Zhao had you send these

264
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:22,818
for me to eat?

265
00:18:23,298 --> 00:18:24,778
You're overthinking, Miss Xu.

266
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:26,338
Our young master

267
00:18:26,499 --> 00:18:27,339
is extremely busy.

268
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:29,058
He has no time to care about it.

269
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:32,499
You wretched maid.

270
00:18:32,818 --> 00:18:33,658
You!

271
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:35,618
Still acting high and mighty?

272
00:18:35,858 --> 00:18:36,698
Listen up.

273
00:18:36,778 --> 00:18:38,138
His Majesty has decreed

274
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:39,659
a marriage between our young master

275
00:18:39,699 --> 00:18:40,539
and General Feihong.

276
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:42,138
Abandon your foolish hopes.

277
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:43,178
What did you say?

278
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:45,098
Chu Zhao is marrying He Yan?

279
00:18:46,618 --> 00:18:47,659
Y-Yes.

280
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:49,259
The news has spread everywhere.

281
00:18:58,899 --> 00:18:59,778
No way.

282
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:01,378
Chu Zhao,

283
00:19:02,618 --> 00:19:03,979
you won't get your way.

284
00:19:17,499 --> 00:19:18,899
Have you met with Miss He?

285
00:19:19,979 --> 00:19:20,819
How about

286
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:22,138
your marriage?

287
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:24,578
There will be no marriage.

288
00:19:26,138 --> 00:19:27,058
Don't bring it up.

289
00:19:50,778 --> 00:19:52,858
I heard about
your imperial marriage decree

290
00:19:53,979 --> 00:19:55,538
and came specially to congratulate you.

291
00:20:01,138 --> 00:20:03,419
Why the haste, Mr. Chu?

292
00:20:07,138 --> 00:20:08,378
I once thought

293
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:11,058
only fools like me

294
00:20:11,818 --> 00:20:13,378
would cling to unrequited feelings,

295
00:20:14,138 --> 00:20:15,219
be used by others

296
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:17,899
and then discarded like trash.

297
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:19,578
I never imagined

298
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:23,058
that a shrewd man

299
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:25,058
like you could also

300
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:28,298
experience unrequited desires.

301
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:31,859
Miss Xu,

302
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:34,019
if you continue this outburst,

303
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:35,778
I'll have to ask you to leave.

304
00:20:36,578 --> 00:20:37,899
If you're done venting,

305
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:39,459
I'll arrange your return.

306
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:46,259
Return?

307
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:49,298
Return where?

308
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:52,179
You killed my father.

309
00:20:52,778 --> 00:20:54,219
My family home is sealed.

310
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:57,298
I have neither a home nor a father.

311
00:20:57,619 --> 00:20:59,899
Even the lowest servants
look down on me.

312
00:21:00,578 --> 00:21:01,499
You tell me to return.

313
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:04,378
Tell me where I should go.

314
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,659
Where should I go? Tell me.

315
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:07,499
Tell me!

316
00:21:11,058 --> 00:21:11,898
Miss Xu.

317
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:15,418
What?

318
00:21:16,298 --> 00:21:17,858
You think yourself the greatest victim?

319
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,058
What of those sold into slavery
and forced to grovel?

320
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:23,298
Or those displaced
and begging on the streets?

321
00:21:23,939 --> 00:21:25,138
Your father's death

322
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:27,858
was nothing but his deserved punishment.

323
00:21:28,338 --> 00:21:31,058
You still live in luxury.

324
00:21:31,378 --> 00:21:33,739
Only deprived of your former status.

325
00:21:36,058 --> 00:21:37,058
And you're whining now?

326
00:21:41,818 --> 00:21:42,778
You deceived me,

327
00:21:43,618 --> 00:21:44,458
betrayed me,

328
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:45,859
and dumped me.

329
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:48,419
But I'd let it all slide.

330
00:21:50,858 --> 00:21:53,058
How could you betray my father?

331
00:21:55,058 --> 00:21:57,578
He may have been a monster to the world,

332
00:21:58,499 --> 00:22:00,739
but he never did you any harm.

333
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:05,098
In this situation,

334
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:07,659
you still act superior.

335
00:22:09,979 --> 00:22:11,259
I don't know if this is pitiful

336
00:22:12,858 --> 00:22:13,939
or laughable.

337
00:22:18,459 --> 00:22:19,299
Chu Zhao.

Guards!

345
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,259
Go fetch a physician. Hurry!

346
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,099
Yes.

347
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:07,658
Yingxiang.

348
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:09,099
It's okay, Yingxiang.

349
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:11,219
It's okay. Don't worry, Yingxiang.

350
00:23:11,219 --> 00:23:12,059
You will be okay.

351
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:13,539
I

352
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:15,299
don't fear.

353
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:19,338
I only fear

354
00:23:21,138 --> 00:23:22,019
in the world,

355
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,699
you'll end up alone.

356
00:23:32,459 --> 00:23:33,459
From now on,

357
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:37,219
stop pushing yourself so hard.

358
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:42,859
Spare...

Spare yourself.
