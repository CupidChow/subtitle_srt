That's all

23
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,620
for today.

24
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:50,140
Remember

25
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,381
to review what you've learned.

26
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:53,860
Tomorrow,

27
00:01:54,101 --> 00:01:56,420
I will personally test you.

28
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,260
Understood.

29
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,461
He always wears a mask.

30
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,260
What's wrong with him?

31
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:10,741
You'll know.

32
00:02:13,412 --> 00:02:14,064
(Huainanzi)

33
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:15,780
Give it back!

34
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:16,780
Come take it back.

35
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:18,141
Come on!

36
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:19,581
Come get it.

37
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:20,540
Come on.

38
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,360
Come on.

39
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,540
You can't get it.

40
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:26,461
You can't get it.

41
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:28,944
Give it back!

42
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,380
Give it back!

43
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:38,512
Let's go.

44
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,301
Thanks.

45
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,540
Short and dumb.

46
00:02:44,181 --> 00:02:44,701
I wonder

47
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:45,820
how you got in.

48
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,780
You eat more at night.

49
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,701
Xianchang Academy

50
00:02:52,701 --> 00:02:53,820
doesn't select me by height.

51
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:55,261
Besides,

52
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,461
I'm not dumb.

53
00:03:06,531 --> 00:03:09,520
=Episode 3=

54
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,901
Bye, Commander Xiao.

55
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:28,740
It's you again.

56
00:04:29,872 --> 00:04:31,770
(Xiao)

57
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,141
He's doing great today.

58
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:14,420
He doesn't lag behind.

59
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:16,740
When fighting me yesterday,

60
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:18,901
he wasn't weak at all.

61
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,980
So, he's been pretending.

62
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,300
Seems we need a more enticing bait.

63
00:05:23,901 --> 00:05:24,980
Let's see

64
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,501
when his true colors emerge.

65
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,381
Since you've doubted

66
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:29,540
He Yan's identity,

67
00:05:29,941 --> 00:05:31,061
why stay quiet?

68
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:33,220
When fighting him,

69
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,821
I sensed his physical weakness,

70
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:38,100
yet his moves flowed effortlessly.

71
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,220
Clearly, he's not an amateur.

72
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,420
He's slippery.

73
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:44,300
Without solid evidence,

74
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,340
he won't confess.

75
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,261
Our task

76
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,980
is to expose his flaws openly.

77
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:55,821
Shen Han.

78
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:58,621
Do something for me.

79
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,328
Yes.

80
00:06:04,381 --> 00:06:05,420
- Let me help you.
- Move.

81
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,100
Come on!

82
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,360
(Jiuqi Camp)

83
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,340
So impressive!

84
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,780
If I could

85
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:05,901
be as brave as them,

86
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:06,608
that'd be great.

87
00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:07,941
Who are they?

88
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:09,061
Why so valiant?

89
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:10,180
Jiuqi Camp.

90
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,821
Jiuqi Camp?

91
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,581
What's that?

92
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:14,740
You don't know?

93
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:16,220
It was founded by Marshal Xiao.

94
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:18,141
It accepts elite warriors only.

95
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:19,621
All in black armor.

96
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:21,420
They're invincible,

97
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,941
the core force of Xiao Army.

98
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,180
All enemies fear them.

99
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:25,340
Why's everyone

100
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,021
suddenly talking about them?

101
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:28,100
Someone

102
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,061
started it.

103
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:30,261
But no one

104
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:31,381
would refuse joining, right?

105
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:37,061
(They're talking about Jiuqi Camp.)

106
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:39,780
(Could it be planned?)

107
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,381
(Xiao Jue noticed something)

108
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,300
(during last night's fight.)

109
00:07:46,021 --> 00:07:47,340
(He set a bait)

110
00:07:47,581 --> 00:07:48,701
(to hook me.)

111
00:07:50,501 --> 00:07:51,184
(Baiting me?)

112
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,901
(I'll play along)

113
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,901
(and join the camp.)

114
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:56,100
(I will do it honorably,)

115
00:07:56,261 --> 00:07:56,980
(flawlessly.)

116
00:07:57,821 --> 00:07:59,261
(Who's bait? Who's prey?)

117
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:00,461
(Game's still on.)

118
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:01,808
Mr. Shen.

119
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:03,056
Mr. Shen.

120
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,621
Zoning out?

121
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,061
Mr. Shen.

122
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:10,192
Work harder,

123
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:11,780
and you can join them too.

124
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,100
They're so formidable.

125
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,100
I'm joining them.

126
00:08:19,381 --> 00:08:20,660
Don't rush to join them

127
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,501
just because of that.

128
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,300
They often spearhead the frontlines,

129
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,180
where casualties

130
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,141
remain alarmingly high.

131
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,501
That's perfect then.

132
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:28,141
They need fresh recruits.

133
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,340
I need military merits.

134
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,901
If I join the Jiuqi Camp,

135
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,141
it's win-win.

136
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,061
We do

137
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,581
select one recruit annually.

138
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,552
However,

139
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:39,660
it must be
the most outstanding candidate.

140
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:40,940
This year,

141
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,780
save yourselves the trouble.

142
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,501
The best candidate is

143
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,981
right before you.

144
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:48,621
Good.

145
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,341
I'll be watching your performance.

146
00:08:57,741 --> 00:08:58,501
He.

147
00:08:58,501 --> 00:08:59,056
Come quick!

148
00:08:59,261 --> 00:09:00,141
Look, meat flatbreads.

149
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:09,700
That flatbread

150
00:09:10,221 --> 00:09:10,861
is mine.

151
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,261
Yours?

152
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:13,981
Call its name

153
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,660
and see if it answers you.

154
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,901
Who can prove this is yours?

155
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:19,540
I'm eating it.

156
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,700
What can you do?

157
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,981
What can I do about it?

158
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:28,464
You...

159
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,264
You...

160
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:30,672
Yes.

161
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:31,856
I did it.

162
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:33,021
Who can verify that?

163
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,981
What can you do about it?

164
00:09:36,101 --> 00:09:36,621
You...

165
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,101
Want a fight?

166
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,552
Fine.

167
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:43,221
Wait for me after training.

168
00:09:43,221 --> 00:09:44,141
I'll make you pay.

169
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:46,060
Enough, He.

170
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:47,540
Don't stoop to his level.

171
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,300
Since he took my food once,

172
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,820
he might do it again.

173
00:09:51,741 --> 00:09:52,780
If he takes my food daily,

174
00:09:53,501 --> 00:09:54,341
should I starve

175
00:09:54,341 --> 00:09:55,101
every single day?

176
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:56,261
That is

177
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:58,261
so not fair.

178
00:09:58,501 --> 00:09:59,901
Are you talking with me

179
00:09:59,901 --> 00:10:01,141
about fairness?

180
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:03,261
With your weakness,

181
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,180
you won't

182
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,741
survive a month here.

183
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,780
Not even a month.

184
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:08,101
No need to wait.

185
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,660
In ten days,

186
00:10:10,101 --> 00:10:10,861
at training field,

187
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,221
I'll defeat you in archery,

188
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,381
your best skill.

189
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:21,861
Are you crazy?

190
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:24,460
You understand your own words?

191
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,540
Which part

192
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,580
did you not hear?

193
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,700
Let me repeat myself.

194
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,381
In ten days,

195
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:32,501
I will defeat you.

196
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:34,420
Pretty boy,

197
00:10:35,021 --> 00:10:36,141
you're very bold.

198
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,576
Alright.

199
00:10:38,901 --> 00:10:40,141
That's a bold wager.

200
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:41,341
- Yes.
- Good.

201
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,820
If you lose,

202
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,420
you'll become an army cook.

203
00:10:46,221 --> 00:10:46,832
Deal.

204
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:48,540
But if you lose,

205
00:10:49,221 --> 00:10:50,101
you'll call me boss.

206
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:55,940
Don't humiliate yourself.

207
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,820
In ten days,

208
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,101
I'll challenge you to a spear duel.

209
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,540
Do you dare to accept it?

210
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:04,460
Since you're so reckless,

211
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:05,901
I'll play along.

212
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,528
Good.

213
00:11:09,221 --> 00:11:10,341
In ten days,

214
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,420
we'll compete.

215
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,460
How dare you!

216
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:15,741
- Commander.
- Commander.

217
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,780
Brawling right after joining the army?

218
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:19,700
Have you no respect for discipline?

219
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,141
It's okay.

220
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:24,460
He wants to join the Jiuqi Camp.

221
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:26,300
I'll see

222
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,460
if he's qualified.

You work so hard,

246
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,501
yet you're still weak.

247
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,101
The sneaky person at the bathing pool

248
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,580
was you, right?

249
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,101
A while ago,

250
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:34,901
I was exhausted from training.

251
00:13:35,221 --> 00:13:36,580
So, I went to bathe to relax.

252
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:40,060
The person who was bathing that night

253
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,700
was actually you.

254
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,420
However,

255
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,060
I panicked and fled recklessly

256
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:46,101
that night.

257
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:47,861
I hope you won't blame me.

258
00:13:49,101 --> 00:13:50,261
You panicked?

259
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,261
Sure, I did.

260
00:13:55,861 --> 00:13:56,901
You're suspicious

261
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,420
and a liar.

262
00:13:58,981 --> 00:14:00,501
What's your real intention?

263
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,760
I want a trainer.

264
00:14:04,621 --> 00:14:05,264
What?

265
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,101
No offense,

266
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,141
but please train me, Commander.

267
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:17,820
What makes you think

268
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,060
I'll train you?

269
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,501
Otherwise, did you

270
00:14:22,981 --> 00:14:24,420
come out so late at night

271
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,901
to ambush a recruit for fun?

272
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,660
I know

273
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:29,460
you're concerned about me.

274
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,660
You think

275
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,861
I have potential.

276
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,540
Practice needs a partner.

277
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,861
Practicing alone

278
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,021
won't work out.

279
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,700
If you train me,

280
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,261
I'm certain I'll make great progress.

281
00:14:41,901 --> 00:14:43,180
Quite cheeky.

282
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,621
If you can resist ten strikes

283
00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:52,420
in a circle,

284
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,420
I'll train you.

285
00:14:57,101 --> 00:14:57,700
Deal.

286
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,460
Can't even hold it.

287
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:01,940
Why should I train you?

288
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:02,704
I...

289
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:43,861
Commander.

290
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:45,700
Ten strikes done.

291
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,060
I'm still in.

292
00:16:57,221 --> 00:16:58,060
My fault.

293
00:16:58,621 --> 00:16:59,180
Accidentally,

294
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,621
I offended you.

295
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:06,861
Commander.

296
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,141
A promise

297
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,220
is a promise.

298
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,740
You can't go back on it.

299
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:12,420
Breaking a promise

300
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:14,101
is a disgrace.

301
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,384
Commander.

302
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,301
Every night, Xu hour.

303
00:17:30,781 --> 00:17:31,381
Thank you.

304
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,940
Thank you, master.

305
00:17:38,821 --> 00:17:39,940
This is your first lesson.

306
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:41,621
Remember your words.

307
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,781
If you can't win,

308
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,821
get out of Yezhou Garrison.

309
00:17:55,821 --> 00:17:57,740
Since you're using
the Jiuqi Camp as bait,

310
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,381
I'll absolutely

311
00:17:59,381 --> 00:18:00,500
take this chance.

312
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,141
I'll certainly use you

313
00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:06,500
to succeed.

314
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,861
He learned quite quickly.

315
00:18:52,301 --> 00:18:52,901
(Commander.)

316
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,061
(A promise)

317
00:18:54,381 --> 00:18:55,220
(is a promise.)

318
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,700
(You can't go back on it.)

319
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,341
(Breaking a promise)

320
00:18:58,901 --> 00:19:00,061
(is a disgrace.)

321
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,260
I never agreed to anything.

322
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:20,781
I've mastered the techniques,

323
00:19:21,341 --> 00:19:22,460
yet he shows no concern.

324
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,624
It's not good.

325
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,341
I must make him

326
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:26,660
witness my progress.

327
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,680
Commander.

328
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,248
Are you there?

329
00:20:36,341 --> 00:20:37,101
Qinglang.

330
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:41,700
Long time no see.

331
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,460
(I once asked a swordsmith)

332
00:20:48,061 --> 00:20:49,381
to forge two swords.

333
00:20:50,061 --> 00:20:51,420
One is named Yinqiu.

334
00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:53,220
I gave that to Huaijin

335
00:20:54,141 --> 00:20:54,940
when he came of age.

336
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,144
This one

337
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,420
is named Qinglang.

338
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,736
Today,

339
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,740
I'll give it to you.

340
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:03,920
Father.

341
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,260
Why did you give him Qinglang?

342
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,020
This sword is valuable.

343
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,341
I can't take it.

344
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:12,980
Constant effort

345
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,260
brings success.

346
00:21:15,061 --> 00:21:15,940
Someday,

347
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,381
you two will become

348
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,541
the twin stars of Wei,

349
00:21:18,901 --> 00:21:19,861
working together.

350
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:20,816
Wielding swords

351
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,101
to defend our land

352
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,541
and protect people.

353
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:25,700
Take it.

354
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,224
I will not

355
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,940
betray your trust.

356
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,061
You're unworthy of this Qinglang Sword

357
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:49,420
from my father.

358
00:22:12,381 --> 00:22:13,660
It's quite a sharp sword.

359
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,700
It's rare to see.

360
00:22:15,141 --> 00:22:16,260
So, I couldn't help

361
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:17,700
touching it.

362
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,660
Commander.

363
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,500
You're magnanimous.

364
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,940
You won't blame me, will you?

365
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,980
The sword you're holding

366
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,621
is quite great too!

367
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,301
Why did you come to my tent?

368
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:39,101
I've practiced diligently

369
00:22:39,381 --> 00:22:40,980
and mastered what you taught me.

370
00:22:41,301 --> 00:22:42,821
Aren't you going to check on me?

371
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,020
I'm busy.

372
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,240
Come.

373
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,420
I knew

374
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,581
you were responsible.

375
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,180
Bet on Wang Ba.

376
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,141
Quick! Tell me!

377
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,020
Who to bet on?

378
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:10,220
On Wang Ba.

379
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,460
- On Wang Ba.
- Me too.

380
00:23:11,821 --> 00:23:12,341
And you?

381
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,341
Jiang Jiao.

382
00:23:13,341 --> 00:23:14,740
Jiang Jiao? Two on Jiang Jiao?

383
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,781
(Jiang Jiao, He Yan, Wang Ba)
Three flatbreads?

384
00:23:15,781 --> 00:23:16,621
I'm all in!

385
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:17,660
My bet's on Wang Ba.

386
00:23:17,781 --> 00:23:18,581
Great!

387
00:23:18,581 --> 00:23:19,260
- Wang Ba!
- One!

388
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,420
- On Jiang Jiao?
- Six!

389
00:23:20,581 --> 00:23:21,821
- Jiang Jiao!
- Jiang Jiao!

390
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,541
(Wang Ba)
Five on Jiang.

391
00:23:23,061 --> 00:23:24,740
Who's got flatbreads left?

392
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,980
Six on Wang Ba.

393
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,180
- And you?
- Jiang Jiao!

394
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,381
You note it all down?

395
00:23:29,821 --> 00:23:30,576
(He Yan)
Of course.

396
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:32,740
(Someone actually bet)

397
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,901
(on He Yan earlier than me.)

398
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,088
Guys!

399
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,101
Listen,

400
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,301
I am

401
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,581
betting ten flatbreads

402
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:40,368
(Jiang Jiao, He Yan, Wang Ba)
on He Yan.

403
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,220
- What?
- Sir.

404
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,020
Are you sure?

405
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:43,700
Absolutely!

406
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:45,861
Very impressive, Mr. Cheng.

407
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,980
He's never short on flatbreads.

408
00:23:48,781 --> 00:23:50,061
Place your bets! Quickly!

409
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:51,901
Wang Ba!

410
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:53,700
- Wang Ba!
- Go!

411
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,381
Wang Ba, come on!

412
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:55,381
Wang Ba, come on!

413
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,180
You'll win.

414
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,740
- You'll win.
- Wang Ba will win!

415
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,700
- He!
- Wang Ba!

416
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,581
Go for it!

417
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,740
Show your skills!

418
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,940
Go, Wang Ba!

419
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,700
Wang Ba!

420
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:07,260
Wang Ba, come on!

421
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,020
Wang Ba, come on!

422
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,700
Wang Ba!

423
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,500
Show your skills!

424
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,141
You'll win!

425
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,061
Wang Ba!

426
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:11,740
Go for it, He!

427
00:24:11,861 --> 00:24:14,020
Wang Ba!

428
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,141
Go for it, He!

429
00:24:15,341 --> 00:24:16,341
He!

430
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,381
Wang Ba!

431
00:24:17,381 --> 00:24:18,260
Go for it, He!

432
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:18,901
You'll win!

433
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,541
Lei Hou.

434
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,621
You bet on me?

435
00:24:21,061 --> 00:24:21,980
I didn't bet on anyone.

436
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,460
Hey.

437
00:24:24,101 --> 00:24:25,381
Change your mind now,

438
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,660
or you'll humiliate yourself.

439
00:24:27,781 --> 00:24:28,341
Exactly!

440
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,260
Give it up!

441
00:24:32,368 --> 00:24:32,880
So funny.

442
00:24:33,301 --> 00:24:34,621
I was about to say the same.

443
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,621
You'll regret it.

444
00:24:37,621 --> 00:24:40,301
Wang Ba!

445
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:41,101
You'll win!

446
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,460
Wang Ba, come on!

447
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,260
You'll win!

448
00:24:43,301 --> 00:24:44,621
Wang Ba, come on!

449
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,500
Wang Ba, come on!

450
00:24:55,301 --> 00:24:56,420
Wang Ba won!

451
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,541
Impressive!

452
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:03,141
Wang Ba won.

453
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:08,220
Awesome!

454
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:09,420
Wang Ba won!

455
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,581
Impressive.

456
00:25:12,101 --> 00:25:12,861
Give it up!

457
00:25:17,061 --> 00:25:17,821
Give it up!

458
00:25:22,141 --> 00:25:23,020
Give it up!

459
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,141
- Give it up!
- Be quiet!

460
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,420
You're humiliating yourself.

461
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,301
Exactly.

462
00:25:30,301 --> 00:25:31,220
Indeed.

463
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,020
Give it up!

464
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,940
Give it up!

465
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,020
Look at him.

466
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:36,420
I knew it.

467
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,621
He's bound to lose.

468
00:25:37,901 --> 00:25:38,821
Give it up!

469
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,861
Give it up!

470
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,101
Give it up!

471
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,901
Get out of here.

472
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:11,952
Well...

473
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,740
Pierced right through!

474
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,541
Quite strong.

475
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:16,341
Is he that skilled?

476
00:26:17,141 --> 00:26:18,420
- Well...
- Precise and powerful.

477
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,700
He's pretty strong.

478
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:23,381
Congrats!

479
00:26:23,861 --> 00:26:24,901
Among these recruits,

480
00:26:25,061 --> 00:26:26,700
you've got a capable heroine.

481
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:27,472
No,

482
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,700
a capable hero.

483
00:26:29,861 --> 00:26:31,020
Both Wang Ba and He Yan

484
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,101
are doing great.

485
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:33,781
Credit goes to Mr. Shen.

486
00:26:34,061 --> 00:26:34,940
Not really, Mr. Cheng.

487
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,341
I can't claim the credit.

488
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,341
Commander Xiao's

489
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,500
training methods work.

490
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,020
My discerning eyes

491
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,381
never misjudge talent.

492
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,861
Remember our wager?

493
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:45,381
No backing out.

494
00:26:47,621 --> 00:26:48,141
Mr. Shen.

495
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,101
Who's your pick?

496
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:50,740
Wang Ba

497
00:26:51,101 --> 00:26:51,781
has potential.

498
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,101
He was a bandit

499
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:53,940
and a rebel.

500
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:54,861
But he's good

501
00:26:55,061 --> 00:26:56,180
at archery.

502
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,500
He Yan

503
00:26:57,901 --> 00:26:58,660
works hard.

504
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,581
He's mild-tempered.

505
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,460
A few years later,

506
00:27:01,781 --> 00:27:02,660
he'll become

507
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,101
the best of the recruits.

508
00:27:04,101 --> 00:27:05,301
You've misjudged, Mr. Shen.

509
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,420
The rebellious one

510
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:08,460
isn't Wang Ba.

511
00:27:11,061 --> 00:27:12,101
But He Yan

512
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,980
is getting more interesting.

513
00:27:18,141 --> 00:27:18,901
After your rest,

514
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,260
- let's...
- I'm rested.

515
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,861
Let's begin.

516
00:27:23,821 --> 00:27:27,781
- Go!
- You can do it!

517
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:29,460
- Jiang Jiao, go for it!
- Go!

518
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:30,460
Go for it!

519
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:33,220
- Come on!
- You can do it!

520
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:37,712
Good!

521
00:27:38,381 --> 00:27:39,581
Excellent!

522
00:27:40,141 --> 00:27:40,660
Keep going!

523
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:41,861
Go for it!

524
00:27:43,861 --> 00:27:44,901
Amazing!

525
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,192
Go for it!

526
00:28:00,861 --> 00:28:02,541
Bravo!

527
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,536
Splendid!

528
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:05,821
Who won?

529
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,020
(Given his strength,)

530
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,660
(is he actually a recruit?)

531
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,500
Why

532
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,420
is He just defending?

533
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:17,180
Faster! Quicker!

534
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,500
One more strike to beat him!

535
00:28:32,581 --> 00:28:33,420
(He's testing me.)

536
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,180
That dodge

537
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:35,980
was so good.

538
00:28:37,781 --> 00:28:38,320
Commander.

539
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,460
He Yan's evasive maneuver is

540
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:40,980
like yours.

541
00:28:45,101 --> 00:28:45,861
Yet he failed

542
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:46,940
to dodge your stone?

543
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,781
He chose not to dodge.

544
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:51,940
(No weapons)

545
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:52,720
(can defeat)

546
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,616
(spears.)

547
00:29:05,821 --> 00:29:07,341
He Yan!

548
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,740
Few people are skilled at spear.

549
00:29:09,101 --> 00:29:09,901
But once they do,

550
00:29:10,301 --> 00:29:11,020
they will not

551
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,541
fear all other weapons.

552
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,584
Well done!

553
00:29:14,061 --> 00:29:16,381
This Jiang Jiao is useless.

554
00:29:16,781 --> 00:29:17,420
Unbelievable.

555
00:29:20,101 --> 00:29:20,660
Pretty boy.

556
00:29:22,901 --> 00:29:23,500
What?

557
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:27,700
A bet's a bet.

558
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,032
Boss.

559
00:29:32,141 --> 00:29:33,101
Oh, right.

560
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:35,141
I almost forgot.

561
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,621
There's someone else

562
00:29:41,581 --> 00:29:42,740
who needs to call me boss.

563
00:29:48,901 --> 00:29:49,420
Wang Ba.

564
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,740
It's your turn.

565
00:29:51,301 --> 00:29:52,901
You're not trying to back out, are you?

566
00:30:00,901 --> 00:30:02,020
Move aside!

567
00:30:08,341 --> 00:30:09,861
B-Bo...

568
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,700
You can...

569
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,740
Boss.

570
00:30:16,141 --> 00:30:17,061
You heard me.

571
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,301
Sure, I did.

572
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:19,740
I just never expected

573
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,821
you'd actually do it.

574
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,541
As a real man...

575
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,260
That's it.

576
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,141
I did it.

577
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:28,660
Stop looking!

578
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,500
Get out of here!

579
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,500
Get out of here!

580
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,061
Let's go.

581
00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:36,341
- Get out of here.
- Go.

582
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,621
Let's train harder.

583
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,541
I lost the bet,

584
00:30:38,901 --> 00:30:40,341
but I watched a good match.

585
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,141
Sure.

586
00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:41,660
Let's go.

587
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,061
Commander.

588
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,500
Commander.

589
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,621
You forgot this.

590
00:30:51,621 --> 00:30:52,260
You did well.

591
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,621
Keep it.

592
00:30:56,101 --> 00:30:57,420
I'll remember

593
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,061
your kindness forever.

594
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,061
Coming!

595
00:31:09,381 --> 00:31:10,000
Flatbreads.

596
00:31:11,901 --> 00:31:12,621
Guys! Listen up!

597
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,260
Thanks to Mr. He,

598
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,180
I won the bet

599
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,381
in today's match.

600
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:18,101
Tonight,

601
00:31:18,301 --> 00:31:18,901
it's my treat.

602
00:31:19,061 --> 00:31:20,220
Just help yourselves.

603
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,740
What are you waiting for?

604
00:31:22,901 --> 00:31:23,700
All of us

605
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,581
should thank Mr. Cheng.

606
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:27,141
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

607
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,101
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

608
00:31:29,781 --> 00:31:30,821
Let's eat!

609
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,861
Let's eat!

610
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,621
Smells good!

611
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:36,980
I know

612
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,581
I am good-looking.

613
00:31:38,901 --> 00:31:39,581
However,

614
00:31:39,581 --> 00:31:40,901
you staring so boldly at me

615
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,381
is making me

616
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,740
feel rather uncomfortable.

617
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,700
Mr. Cheng.

618
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,781
You're overthinking.

619
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:48,260
I doubt

620
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,500
the flatbreads you won

621
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,500
are enough for us.

622
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,061
This is my way of repaying you.

623
00:31:53,301 --> 00:31:54,940
You may lose more than you gain.

624
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,020
It's worth it.

625
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,740
Bring the soup if it's ready.

626
00:32:00,141 --> 00:32:02,220
Great!

627
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,061
Smells so good.

628
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,141
Smells so good.

629
00:32:07,141 --> 00:32:08,700
Exactly! Where are the bowls?

630
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,220
- Give me a bowl.
- Thanks, Mr. Cheng!

631
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:11,420
The soup is served.

632
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,341
Your title as Yezhou's top warrior

633
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,581
might be in jeopardy.

634
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:15,901
Mr. He

635
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,621
has trained hard this month.

636
00:32:17,821 --> 00:32:19,420
That's why he shocked everyone today.

637
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,260
Both of us

638
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,660
stop being jealous.

639
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,301
Mr. He.

640
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,821
Congrats!

641
00:32:28,301 --> 00:32:29,020
Thanks, Mr. Lei.

642
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:35,792
Commander.

643
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,980
At the training field,

644
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:37,940
you said

645
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,781
he chose not to dodge.
What did you mean?

646
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:41,861
I used the Jiuqi Camp as bait

647
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,660
to lure him to duel.

648
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,500
While he was overwhelmed,

649
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:46,420
I secretly acted

650
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,220
to force him to reveal some flaw.

651
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:50,901
Unexpectedly,

652
00:32:52,141 --> 00:32:52,901
he actually

653
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,061
discerned my intention.

654
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:55,660
So, he didn't dodge.

655
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,420
He's not only resilient,

656
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:01,581
but also clever.

657
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,781
He's a formidable opponent.

658
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:06,061
Anyway,

659
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,301
He Yan

660
00:33:07,301 --> 00:33:08,460
is definitely up to no good.

661
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,500
Shall I go arrest him first?

662
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,581
No rush.

663
00:33:12,861 --> 00:33:14,020
So, you already have a plan?

664
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,460
These new recruits

665
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,940
have been training

666
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,700
for a full month.

667
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,381
It's time for their competition.

668
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,220
Then

669
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,381
the truth will reveal itself.
