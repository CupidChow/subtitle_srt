=Episode 28=

23
00:01:39,624 --> 00:01:40,464
The lord and lady

24
00:01:40,464 --> 00:01:41,783
are really adaptable.

25
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:43,984
Now that you're in a high position,

26
00:01:44,184 --> 00:01:45,703
they've become servile.

27
00:01:46,863 --> 00:01:47,863
But in my opinion,

28
00:01:48,184 --> 00:01:49,583
they agreed readily enough,

29
00:01:50,063 --> 00:01:51,583
but there's little sincerity.

30
00:01:52,063 --> 00:01:53,143
Sincere or not,

31
00:01:53,303 --> 00:01:54,184
it doesn't matter.

32
00:01:54,863 --> 00:01:55,984
I want them

33
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:57,583
to bow their heads before Mother

34
00:01:57,624 --> 00:01:58,544
and admit their wrongs.

35
00:01:59,423 --> 00:02:00,223
But that is

36
00:02:00,503 --> 00:02:01,583
a very lenient punishment.

37
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:04,784
Not at all.

38
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,863
Their resentment is the point.

39
00:02:07,224 --> 00:02:08,463
Mother doesn't need

40
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:09,664
fair-weather relationships.

41
00:02:10,784 --> 00:02:11,824
I want them

42
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:12,944
to swallow their pride

43
00:02:13,463 --> 00:02:14,743
and humble themselves

44
00:02:14,903 --> 00:02:15,824
before Mother.

45
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:18,504
Let them taste

46
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:20,664
the humiliation Mother endured.

47
00:02:21,544 --> 00:02:23,023
Glad to see your wish was fulfilled.

48
00:02:24,463 --> 00:02:24,984
Not yet.

49
00:02:25,863 --> 00:02:26,583
What?

50
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:28,984
Well.

51
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:30,463
Are you done?

52
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,583
Can we go take a walk?

53
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:33,264
Why are you here?

54
00:02:33,664 --> 00:02:34,784
If you don't come to me,

55
00:02:35,104 --> 00:02:36,423
I'll come to you instead.

56
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:39,903
I have official paperwork

57
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:41,064
to complete.

58
00:02:42,384 --> 00:02:42,863
Chu Zhao,

59
00:02:43,224 --> 00:02:44,264
is it on purpose?

60
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,303
It seems

61
00:02:46,623 --> 00:02:47,344
my paperwork needs

62
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:48,303
your approval?

63
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,023
That's not what I meant.

64
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:52,984
Yingxiang, let's go back.

65
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:55,784
What?

66
00:02:56,423 --> 00:02:57,183
Not even some tea

67
00:02:57,183 --> 00:02:58,264
for me?

68
00:02:58,824 --> 00:02:59,944
Must Lady Shijin

69
00:02:59,984 --> 00:03:01,064
personally host me?

70
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:02,064
Sir.

71
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:04,264
I'll prepare tea for Miss Xu

72
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,183
and be back shortly.

73
00:03:13,784 --> 00:03:14,984
Aren't you serving me tea?

74
00:03:15,544 --> 00:03:16,064
Let's go.

75
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,064
Enjoy your tea, Miss Xu.

76
00:03:25,463 --> 00:03:26,183
It's cold.

77
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:45,623
This one seems scalding hot.

78
00:03:45,903 --> 00:03:46,903
Bring another cup.

79
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,023
Is this

80
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:53,064
how you treat guests?

81
00:03:53,463 --> 00:03:54,903
What has Chu Zhao taught you?

82
00:04:00,743 --> 00:04:01,944
Though I'm a servant,

83
00:04:02,264 --> 00:04:03,463
I keep proper decorum.

84
00:04:04,064 --> 00:04:05,104
You're a lady of status

85
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:06,984
but lack dignity.

86
00:04:08,544 --> 00:04:09,143
How dare you?

87
00:04:09,544 --> 00:04:10,423
My young master

88
00:04:10,903 --> 00:04:11,984
taught me this.

89
00:04:12,464 --> 00:04:13,303
When above others,

90
00:04:13,664 --> 00:04:14,704
treat them as equals.

91
00:04:15,263 --> 00:04:16,144
When below others,

92
00:04:16,664 --> 00:04:17,623
maintain your integrity.

93
00:04:18,104 --> 00:04:18,984
I've learned it.

94
00:04:19,383 --> 00:04:20,224
I wonder

95
00:04:20,784 --> 00:04:21,984
if you've grasped it.

96
00:04:29,423 --> 00:04:30,823
If you're satisfied now,

97
00:04:31,503 --> 00:04:32,823
I'll take my leave.

98
00:04:51,823 --> 00:04:52,623
Father.

99
00:04:53,183 --> 00:04:53,664
Pingting.

100
00:04:53,863 --> 00:04:54,303
What's it?

101
00:04:54,584 --> 00:04:55,183
What happened?

102
00:04:55,943 --> 00:04:56,584
Tell me.

103
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,344
He doesn't care about me at all.

104
00:05:00,943 --> 00:05:03,183
That's why he let that wretched maid

105
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,823
humiliate me like this.

106
00:05:07,144 --> 00:05:07,823
Don't cry.

107
00:05:09,823 --> 00:05:11,984
I'll make this right for you.

108
00:05:14,823 --> 00:05:16,183
A mere fourth-rank official.

109
00:05:16,464 --> 00:05:18,743
Who does he think he is?

110
00:05:28,263 --> 00:05:28,904
Zilan.

111
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:31,344
Aren't these hibiscus flowers

112
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,664
laughable?

113
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:34,823
Laughable?

114
00:05:35,383 --> 00:05:35,943
Yes.

115
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,303
See how they

116
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:39,904
bloom so vibrantly now.

117
00:05:40,183 --> 00:05:42,464
Unaware that winter's chill

118
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:43,984
will soon arrive.

119
00:05:44,383 --> 00:05:46,224
When bitter winds blow,

120
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:49,224
how long can they last?

121
00:05:53,224 --> 00:05:54,224
Your maid...

122
00:05:54,544 --> 00:05:55,904
What's her name?

123
00:06:02,024 --> 00:06:02,784
A lowly person.

124
00:06:03,303 --> 00:06:03,984
Not important.

125
00:06:07,984 --> 00:06:09,544
These gorgeous flowers

126
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:12,623
can hardly survive winter

127
00:06:13,183 --> 00:06:15,984
without someone to shield them.

128
00:06:16,224 --> 00:06:19,104
Not to mention those worthless weeds.

129
00:06:19,904 --> 00:06:21,224
One careless mistake,

130
00:06:21,704 --> 00:06:24,623
and they'll end up
getting crushed underfoot.

131
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:27,263
Zilan.

132
00:06:29,183 --> 00:06:30,024
What do you think?

133
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,383
Thank you for the reminder.

134
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:37,823
I know

135
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:39,263
I was wrong.

136
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:16,904
Rufei.

137
00:07:17,224 --> 00:07:17,664
Rufei.

138
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:18,584
Are you okay?

139
00:07:19,623 --> 00:07:21,024
I'll fetch a physician for you.

140
00:07:23,263 --> 00:07:24,863
I'm the mighty General Feihong.

141
00:07:25,224 --> 00:07:26,383
A minor injury like this

142
00:07:26,743 --> 00:07:27,784
means nothing to me.

143
00:07:32,183 --> 00:07:32,704
Right.

144
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,183
Rufei,

145
00:07:36,024 --> 00:07:38,144
you've been frail since childhood.

146
00:07:38,823 --> 00:07:40,784
I've always worried sick

147
00:07:41,063 --> 00:07:42,183
about you.

148
00:07:42,664 --> 00:07:44,584
But now, you command troops in battle

149
00:07:44,904 --> 00:07:45,584
and have become

150
00:07:45,743 --> 00:07:47,383
the true General Feihong.

151
00:08:29,903 --> 00:08:32,064
Young Master. Please take your medicine.

152
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:37,023
Young Master.

153
00:08:38,023 --> 00:08:38,584
Your health

154
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:39,623
has barely recovered.

155
00:08:40,543 --> 00:08:41,503
Don't stop the medicine.

156
00:09:02,143 --> 00:09:03,984
What's the use of recovering?

157
00:09:04,903 --> 00:09:06,263
I'm still trapped

158
00:09:06,304 --> 00:09:07,704
in this wretched courtyard,

159
00:09:08,824 --> 00:09:10,263
unable to go anywhere,

160
00:09:11,903 --> 00:09:12,824
and unable

161
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:15,263
to do anything.

162
00:09:25,863 --> 00:09:27,543
What do you want to do?

163
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:33,424
Who are you?

164
00:09:34,543 --> 00:09:35,824
Xu Jingfu.

165
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,023
I know

166
00:09:38,584 --> 00:09:41,464
you're the real He Rufei.

167
00:09:47,944 --> 00:09:50,623
I am the real He Rufei.

168
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:00,704
Sir,

169
00:10:02,263 --> 00:10:04,344
what brings you here?

170
00:10:05,424 --> 00:10:07,023
I can help you

171
00:10:07,543 --> 00:10:10,464
become the real General Feihong

172
00:10:11,503 --> 00:10:14,064
and achieve your deepest desires.

173
00:10:25,304 --> 00:10:26,104
What do you need

174
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:27,903
me to do?

175
00:10:49,824 --> 00:10:50,623
(He Yan,)

176
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:53,584
(every drop of blood I shed,)

177
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:56,704
(you'll pay back in full.)

178
00:10:58,104 --> 00:10:59,503
(Times have changed.)

179
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:01,863
(General Feihong's swordsmanship
is peerless,)

180
00:11:02,263 --> 00:11:04,584
(and he couldn't possibly be
an invalid.)

181
00:11:05,503 --> 00:11:07,184
(I can't be who I was before.)

182
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:15,424
(Chai Anxi resents Xiao Zhongwu)

183
00:11:15,464 --> 00:11:16,704
(for warmongering)

184
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,143
(and has long held grudges.)

185
00:11:19,743 --> 00:11:20,704
(Son Chai Qian)
(Recently,)

186
00:11:21,184 --> 00:11:23,903
(his only child died in battle,)

187
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:27,663
(deepening his hatred for Xiao Zhongwu.)

188
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:31,184
(We can exploit this.)

189
00:11:43,824 --> 00:11:45,984
You're General Feihong, He Rufei?

190
00:11:48,143 --> 00:11:49,783
Our family heirloom jade pendant

191
00:11:50,224 --> 00:11:52,023
is only passed
to the eldest legitimate son.

192
00:11:52,383 --> 00:11:53,383
But you're supposed to be

193
00:11:53,424 --> 00:11:54,663
on the front lines.

194
00:11:55,023 --> 00:11:56,743
You want revenge for your son,

195
00:11:56,944 --> 00:11:57,464
don't you?

196
00:12:00,143 --> 00:12:02,623
I can help you.

197
00:12:07,903 --> 00:12:09,184
That message-carrying lieutenant

198
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:10,623
was later killed

199
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,064
by Ding Yi in battle.

200
00:12:13,304 --> 00:12:14,464
Flawlessly executed.

201
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:16,104
That's why Xiao Jue

202
00:12:16,263 --> 00:12:17,584
couldn't find any evidence.

203
00:12:18,663 --> 00:12:19,903
I never imagined

204
00:12:20,903 --> 00:12:21,743
you'd done so much

205
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,984
for Chancellor Xu.

206
00:12:23,263 --> 00:12:24,743
My son!

207
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:26,984
Each of these deeds

208
00:12:27,104 --> 00:12:27,944
warrants beheading

209
00:12:27,984 --> 00:12:29,623
or even clan extermination.

210
00:12:30,863 --> 00:12:31,503
Chancellor Xu

211
00:12:31,743 --> 00:12:32,464
just wants

212
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:33,344
an obedient general

213
00:12:33,383 --> 00:12:34,863
to counter the Xiao Army.

214
00:12:35,503 --> 00:12:37,104
But if things go wrong,

215
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:37,783
the blame

216
00:12:37,944 --> 00:12:39,503
will fall solely on you.

217
00:12:39,863 --> 00:12:40,743
I'm not afraid of him.

218
00:12:42,104 --> 00:12:43,944
I'm not his pawn.

219
00:12:45,944 --> 00:12:46,503
I am

220
00:12:47,704 --> 00:12:50,263
the undeniable proof of his guilt.

221
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:51,304
But...

222
00:12:51,344 --> 00:12:52,023
Father.

223
00:12:52,584 --> 00:12:54,704
As the eldest son
of our family's main lineage,

224
00:12:55,143 --> 00:12:56,263
everything I've done

225
00:12:56,824 --> 00:12:57,903
has been to strengthen

226
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,143
our main lineage.

227
00:12:59,824 --> 00:13:01,104
So, from now on,

228
00:13:01,543 --> 00:13:02,824
no matter what happens,

229
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:04,224
both of us

230
00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:06,184
must stand united.

231
00:13:07,344 --> 00:13:08,023
Understand?

232
00:13:11,503 --> 00:13:12,064
Yes.

233
00:13:13,623 --> 00:13:16,503
I understand.

234
00:13:19,944 --> 00:13:20,464
Father,

235
00:13:21,944 --> 00:13:23,503
He Yan isn't actually dead.

236
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:25,224
What?

237
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:27,944
And she's about to return.

238
00:13:30,383 --> 00:13:31,584
But rest assured.

239
00:13:32,663 --> 00:13:33,344
I absolutely

240
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:35,984
won't let her enter the capital alive.

241
00:13:42,903 --> 00:13:43,543
Gentlemen,

242
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:44,383
you look weary.

243
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:45,783
Please come inside.

244
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:53,376
(Prosperity Inn)

245
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:56,584
As we're near Yaojing,

246
00:13:56,704 --> 00:13:58,023
Yan He has vanished.

247
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,783
Seems he's eager to return home.

248
00:14:01,263 --> 00:14:02,263
Sir, your tea.

249
00:14:03,424 --> 00:14:04,623
His wife is pregnant.

250
00:14:05,704 --> 00:14:06,383
He's concerned.

251
00:14:08,424 --> 00:14:09,424
You'll be home soon too.

252
00:14:10,704 --> 00:14:11,104
Right.

253
00:14:13,944 --> 00:14:14,464
That's good.

254
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:44,104
Where will you stay?

255
00:14:46,663 --> 00:14:47,224
I...

256
00:14:47,944 --> 00:14:49,623
I'll just stay at any inn.

257
00:14:50,263 --> 00:14:51,863
I have recently received some rewards.

258
00:14:52,064 --> 00:14:53,023
So I'm better off now.

259
00:14:57,383 --> 00:14:57,743
Waiter.

260
00:14:57,783 --> 00:14:58,464
Two steamed buns.

261
00:14:58,824 --> 00:14:59,263
Coming.

262
00:15:11,383 --> 00:15:12,783
Why not stay at the Xiao Mansion?

263
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:13,984
It has a big yard.

264
00:15:14,304 --> 00:15:15,464
And you're Commander's man.

265
00:15:16,064 --> 00:15:16,783
It's appropriate

266
00:15:17,104 --> 00:15:17,584
to be there.

267
00:15:21,464 --> 00:15:21,944
No need.

268
00:15:21,944 --> 00:15:22,263
Okay.

269
00:15:22,263 --> 00:15:22,584
I...

270
00:15:55,184 --> 00:15:55,903
Gentlemen,

271
00:15:56,263 --> 00:15:58,064
our freshest tea.

272
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,344
Please enjoy.

273
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:11,704
Here.

274
00:16:12,143 --> 00:16:12,783
Sir.

275
00:16:14,104 --> 00:16:14,824
Gentlemen,

276
00:16:15,064 --> 00:16:15,704
fresh tea.

277
00:16:16,023 --> 00:16:17,584
It's best enjoyed while hot.

278
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:18,383
Alright.

279
00:16:43,383 --> 00:16:43,704
Go.

280
00:16:43,944 --> 00:16:44,824
Who sent you?

281
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:03,464
Commander,

282
00:17:03,864 --> 00:17:05,263
these men seem to be targeting you.

283
00:17:07,424 --> 00:17:08,263
I have many enemies.

284
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:18,984
Don't fear. All's well.

285
00:18:49,184 --> 00:18:49,823
It appears

286
00:18:50,384 --> 00:18:51,464
they're after me.

287
00:18:53,384 --> 00:18:53,944
Are you hurt?

288
00:18:56,624 --> 00:18:57,144
I'm fine.

289
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:58,503
They couldn't defeat me.

290
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:14,464
Suicide operatives

291
00:19:14,823 --> 00:19:15,944
with poison in their teeth.

292
00:19:16,984 --> 00:19:17,624
They took it

293
00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:18,464
when cornered.

294
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:19,704
We're in Chonghuai.

295
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:21,944
I'll have Yang Mingzhi

296
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:23,664
from the county office come

297
00:19:24,783 --> 00:19:25,944
and look into their origins.

298
00:19:27,743 --> 00:19:28,224
Okay.

299
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:30,263
But I know

300
00:19:31,184 --> 00:19:32,224
who sent these assassins

301
00:19:32,263 --> 00:19:33,263
without an investigation.

302
00:19:36,224 --> 00:19:37,864
They've tried to kill me again.

303
00:19:42,368 --> 00:19:44,512
(Chu Mansion)

304
00:20:22,184 --> 00:20:23,023
My painting is crude.

305
00:20:23,144 --> 00:20:23,783
Don't look.

306
00:20:26,864 --> 00:20:28,144
The essence of painting plums

307
00:20:28,464 --> 00:20:29,783
lies in layering and variation.

308
00:20:32,823 --> 00:20:33,263
Like this.

309
00:20:41,424 --> 00:20:41,783
Here.

310
00:20:54,343 --> 00:20:54,864
Zilan.

311
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,063
My bad.

312
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:00,464
It's okay.

313
00:21:00,984 --> 00:21:01,823
I'll get changed

314
00:21:02,103 --> 00:21:02,743
and return soon.

315
00:22:20,224 --> 00:22:20,743
Sorry.

316
00:22:21,904 --> 00:22:23,184
Our plum painting is unfinished.

317
00:22:24,103 --> 00:22:24,664
Continue?

318
00:22:27,864 --> 00:22:28,424
Yes.

319
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:39,184
Here, look.

320
00:22:46,384 --> 00:22:47,144
(Yaojing City)
Pendants.

321
00:22:49,624 --> 00:22:50,543
Come and take a look.

322
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,136
(Yaojing City)

323
00:23:03,743 --> 00:23:05,384
- General Feihong!
- General Feihong!

324
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:06,944
- General Feihong!
- General Feihong!

325
00:23:07,023 --> 00:23:08,184
Do you intend to cling to

326
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:09,944
an identity that isn't yours

327
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,184
forever?

328
00:23:12,464 --> 00:23:13,103
But

329
00:23:13,624 --> 00:23:15,063
your current achievements

330
00:23:15,343 --> 00:23:16,343
are entirely built upon

331
00:23:16,624 --> 00:23:18,543
being the He family's legitimate heir.

332
00:23:24,023 --> 00:23:24,624
Yaojing.

333
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,823
I've finally returned.

334
00:23:31,664 --> 00:23:32,904
I've sent people to Huayuan

335
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:34,144
to look for

336
00:23:34,624 --> 00:23:35,263
evidence.

337
00:23:35,823 --> 00:23:36,303
Besides,

338
00:23:37,023 --> 00:23:37,503
recently,

339
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:38,743
I received a letter from home.

340
00:23:39,343 --> 00:23:40,624
We're commanded to attend

341
00:23:41,224 --> 00:23:42,103
the Mid-Autumn banquet

342
00:23:43,063 --> 00:23:43,783
at the palace.

343
00:23:46,543 --> 00:23:47,063
By then,

344
00:23:47,664 --> 00:23:49,263
Xu Jingfu and He Rufei

345
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:50,624
will surely attend.

346
00:23:52,944 --> 00:23:53,864
They must have received

347
00:23:53,904 --> 00:23:55,103
news of our return.

348
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,743
But under the Emperor's watchful eye

349
00:23:58,343 --> 00:23:59,704
and considering our positions,

350
00:24:00,464 --> 00:24:01,823
they won't make any moves

351
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:03,864
before the Mid-Autumn banquet.

352
00:24:04,424 --> 00:24:06,063
You're General Fengyun,

353
00:24:06,664 --> 00:24:08,224
and I'm Attendant Wu'an.

354
00:24:09,343 --> 00:24:10,103
We should naturally

355
00:24:10,424 --> 00:24:12,063
enter the palace banquet with dignity.

356
00:24:12,783 --> 00:24:14,224
If He Rufei

357
00:24:14,384 --> 00:24:15,664
provokes us,

358
00:24:16,343 --> 00:24:16,944
I'm not afraid.

359
00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:18,624
But if he

360
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:20,464
avoids confronting me,

361
00:24:21,823 --> 00:24:23,263
I'll certainly seek him out.

362
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:24,904
I'll plant suspicion

363
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:26,864
in mind of His Majesty

364
00:24:27,144 --> 00:24:28,384
and the court officials.

365
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:31,424
General He,

366
00:24:31,624 --> 00:24:32,984
you're meticulously planning

367
00:24:33,343 --> 00:24:34,303
every move.

368
00:24:34,944 --> 00:24:36,664
By the end of the Mid-Autumn banquet,

369
00:24:37,823 --> 00:24:38,583
the investigation

370
00:24:38,664 --> 00:24:40,224
in Huayuan will have yielded results.

371
00:24:41,263 --> 00:24:42,063
Then,

372
00:24:42,704 --> 00:24:43,904
we'll determine our next steps

373
00:24:44,464 --> 00:24:46,023
based on the situation.

374
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:48,023
Stolen things

375
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:50,624
must eventually be returned.

376
00:24:51,224 --> 00:24:51,984
He Rufei,

377
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:53,864
between you and me,

378
00:24:55,063 --> 00:24:56,664
it's a fight to the death.

379
00:25:05,944 --> 00:25:06,343
Sir,

380
00:25:06,823 --> 00:25:07,743
the Master and Mistress

381
00:25:07,783 --> 00:25:08,823
ask you to have dinner.

382
00:25:11,823 --> 00:25:12,184
Sir,

383
00:25:12,503 --> 00:25:12,783
your

384
00:25:13,023 --> 00:25:13,743
jade pendant...

385
00:25:38,656 --> 00:25:41,760
(Xiao Mansion)

386
00:26:02,263 --> 00:26:02,704
Jing.

387
00:26:03,704 --> 00:26:04,184
Madam.

388
00:26:06,343 --> 00:26:07,224
You're finally back.

389
00:26:08,303 --> 00:26:08,823
I'm back

390
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:10,424
with a friend.

391
00:26:11,984 --> 00:26:12,664
This is He Yan.

392
00:26:16,023 --> 00:26:16,704
I am He Yan.

393
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:18,704
Mr. Xiao and Madam.

394
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,464
So you're Huaijin's friend.

395
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:22,023
How extraordinary.

396
00:26:22,424 --> 00:26:23,543
We've never seen Huaijin

397
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:24,743
bring friends home before.

398
00:26:25,144 --> 00:26:26,224
Your friendship must be

399
00:26:26,424 --> 00:26:27,103
exceptional.

400
00:26:29,023 --> 00:26:29,743
Good to see you.

401
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:31,224
Rongwei personally made dinner

402
00:26:31,743 --> 00:26:32,823
while awaiting your return.

403
00:26:34,224 --> 00:26:34,704
I want

404
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:36,583
to first see Father and Mother.

405
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,696
(Ancestral Tablets of the Xiao Clan)

406
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:03,159
(Xiao)

407
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:05,755
(Commemoration)

408
00:27:22,263 --> 00:27:22,704
(Jing,)

409
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:24,864
(only by retaking Que City)

410
00:27:25,303 --> 00:27:28,543
(can we uncover the truth of Mingshui,
clear Father's name,)

411
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:30,464
(and honor the 30,000 fallen men.)

412
00:27:31,624 --> 00:27:32,184
(I)

413
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:34,424
(deserve to die for this.)

414
00:28:01,144 --> 00:28:01,583
Mr. He,

415
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,384
he's been away so long.

416
00:28:06,023 --> 00:28:06,944
Let him spend time

417
00:28:07,343 --> 00:28:08,263
with Father and Mother.

418
00:28:09,743 --> 00:28:10,343
How about

419
00:28:10,743 --> 00:28:11,823
we wait in the parlour?

420
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:15,023
After you.

421
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:24,944
Ancestors,

422
00:28:25,543 --> 00:28:26,343
your descendant,

423
00:28:26,624 --> 00:28:27,624
Xiao Jue, have returned.

424
00:28:28,224 --> 00:28:29,184
This time,

425
00:28:30,103 --> 00:28:31,184
I will surely expose

426
00:28:31,224 --> 00:28:32,224
the disloyal officials,

427
00:28:33,464 --> 00:28:34,503
purge the imperial court,

428
00:28:35,263 --> 00:28:36,783
clear our family's name,

429
00:28:37,063 --> 00:28:38,503
and get justice for our army.

430
00:28:40,664 --> 00:28:41,823
May you protect us.

431
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,760
(Tablet of Father Xiao Zhongwu)

432
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:06,063
(Tablet of Mother Song Wan)
Father, Mother,

433
00:29:06,864 --> 00:29:07,783
I have something

434
00:29:08,743 --> 00:29:09,743
to tell you.

435
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:13,904
I've found the most significant person

436
00:29:14,543 --> 00:29:15,503
in my life.

437
00:29:16,263 --> 00:29:17,904
But she still has unfinished matters.

438
00:29:18,503 --> 00:29:19,904
When everything settles down,

439
00:29:20,783 --> 00:29:21,664
I'll surely bring her

440
00:29:22,503 --> 00:29:23,144
to meet you.

441
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:38,704
These coming days,

442
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,144
I'll be troubling you

443
00:29:40,263 --> 00:29:40,984
and your wife.

444
00:29:41,384 --> 00:29:42,583
No need for formalities.

445
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,103
Since you're Huaijin's friend,

446
00:29:44,303 --> 00:29:45,303
you're our friend too.

447
00:29:45,624 --> 00:29:47,224
Treat this place as your own home.

448
00:29:47,503 --> 00:29:48,944
Stay as long as you wish.

449
00:29:48,984 --> 00:29:49,783
Just relax.

450
00:29:50,904 --> 00:29:51,864
Don't trouble yourself.

451
00:29:52,464 --> 00:29:53,144
The guest room

452
00:29:53,343 --> 00:29:54,543
to my west will be fine.

453
00:29:55,783 --> 00:29:56,303
Huaijin,

454
00:29:57,384 --> 00:29:59,023
didn't you always prefer tranquility?

455
00:29:59,503 --> 00:30:01,023
Why this sudden change?

456
00:30:05,144 --> 00:30:06,624
It seems Huaijin and Mr. He

457
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:07,503
get along well.

458
00:30:08,263 --> 00:30:08,864
Eat a lot.

459
00:30:23,624 --> 00:30:24,904
The mushroom and chicken stew.

460
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:27,303
Your favorite.

461
00:30:27,664 --> 00:30:28,184
Eat it.

462
00:30:29,384 --> 00:30:30,263
You remember?

463
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:34,184
Your favorite.

464
00:30:34,464 --> 00:30:35,303
Of course, I do.

465
00:30:37,063 --> 00:30:39,144
You two share a brotherly bond.

466
00:30:40,224 --> 00:30:41,704
He's never shown this level of care

467
00:30:41,864 --> 00:30:43,144
toward me as his elder brother.

468
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:48,984
Eat a lot.

469
00:30:58,783 --> 00:30:59,263
Eat.

470
00:31:07,424 --> 00:31:07,904
Miss,

471
00:31:08,303 --> 00:31:08,984
come take a look.

472
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,704
How terribly rude of me

473
00:31:12,063 --> 00:31:13,263
to visit Mr. and Mrs. Xiao

474
00:31:13,303 --> 00:31:14,464
without bringing gifts.

475
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:15,583
I came empty-handed.

476
00:31:22,864 --> 00:31:24,103
What should I buy?

477
00:31:33,303 --> 00:31:34,543
You're sent by He Rufei, right?

478
00:31:35,023 --> 00:31:35,503
Sir,

479
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:36,263
what?

480
00:31:36,664 --> 00:31:37,783
I'm merely passing through.

481
00:31:39,503 --> 00:31:40,743
I'll spare you today.

482
00:31:41,263 --> 00:31:42,503
Tell your master.

483
00:31:43,103 --> 00:31:43,743
Your debt

484
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,464
will be paid.

485
00:31:52,224 --> 00:31:52,664
Sir,

486
00:31:53,303 --> 00:31:54,583
our people

487
00:31:54,743 --> 00:31:55,823
were discovered by He Yan.

488
00:32:01,664 --> 00:32:02,384
"Discovered"?

489
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:06,864
Young Master,

490
00:32:07,023 --> 00:32:07,664
I am useless.

491
00:32:07,704 --> 00:32:09,184
You failed at both tracking

492
00:32:09,624 --> 00:32:11,063
and assassination.

493
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:11,783
Useless!

494
00:32:15,743 --> 00:32:16,543
Where is she now?

495
00:32:17,343 --> 00:32:18,023
In the mansion?

496
00:32:18,624 --> 00:32:19,063
No.

497
00:32:19,424 --> 00:32:19,864
She said,

498
00:32:20,144 --> 00:32:20,743
"Your debt

499
00:32:20,984 --> 00:32:21,743
will be paid."

500
00:32:26,543 --> 00:32:27,023
Right.

501
00:32:28,343 --> 00:32:29,583
Now that she's in the capital,

502
00:32:30,944 --> 00:32:33,503
it's either her destruction or ours.

503
00:32:41,624 --> 00:32:42,904
Let's go to that cosmetics shop

504
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:44,343
we went to the other day?

505
00:32:44,384 --> 00:32:44,743
