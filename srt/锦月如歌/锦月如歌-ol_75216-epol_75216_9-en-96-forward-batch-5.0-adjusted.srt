=Episode 9=

23
00:01:51,824 --> 00:01:52,464
Mr. Chu.

24
00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:55,904
Mr. Sun want to see
you in the reception hall.

25
00:01:59,025 --> 00:02:00,425
Attend to your duties, Mr. Chu.

26
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:04,785
Rest well.

27
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:34,704
Commander Xiao.

28
00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:39,904
Mr. Sun.

29
00:02:41,145 --> 00:02:43,385
Might I know why you're here?

30
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:45,425
This courtyard

31
00:02:45,784 --> 00:02:46,784
is particularly elegant,

32
00:02:47,064 --> 00:02:47,944
so I took a stroll.

33
00:02:48,464 --> 00:02:49,425
But I lost my way.

34
00:02:50,768 --> 00:02:51,585
I'm sorry

35
00:02:51,624 --> 00:02:53,105
I haven't been a better host

36
00:02:53,184 --> 00:02:54,105
and shown you

37
00:02:54,105 --> 00:02:55,145
around the premises.

38
00:02:56,184 --> 00:02:57,425
Since the sunshine today

39
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:01,425
is mild,

40
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,464
shall we have tea in the pavilion?

41
00:03:05,944 --> 00:03:06,585
This way.

42
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:08,184
Have some tea.

43
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:09,105
Have some tea.

44
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,472
Young Master.

45
00:03:11,904 --> 00:03:12,784
The account records

46
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:14,184
are in Sun Ling's secret room.

47
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:15,265
Earlier,

48
00:03:15,344 --> 00:03:16,784
I concealed myself and was waiting,

49
00:03:17,305 --> 00:03:17,944
but observed

50
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:19,585
Xiao Jue stealthily entering the study.

51
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:30,425
Young Master,

52
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:32,025
could he also be

53
00:03:32,064 --> 00:03:33,064
after account records?

54
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,064
He couldn't have found

55
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,504
Sun Xiangfu's dealings

56
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:40,664
with Master.

57
00:03:41,344 --> 00:03:43,280
He's likely
after Yezhou Garrison's tax ledgers.

58
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,265
But if he obtains them first,

59
00:03:45,504 --> 00:03:46,385
we'll lose

60
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:47,105
the initiative.

61
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:49,184
Yingxiang,

62
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:50,944
watch

63
00:03:50,944 --> 00:03:52,105
Xiao Jue's every move.

64
00:03:52,985 --> 00:03:53,585
Yes.

65
00:05:15,265 --> 00:05:16,945
Commander Xiao, have some tea.

66
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:20,945
This smells like

67
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:22,585
the Junshan Yinzhen tea.

68
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:24,625
Excellent quality indeed.

69
00:05:25,705 --> 00:05:26,304
Mr. Sun,

70
00:05:27,344 --> 00:05:28,745
your generosity knows no bounds.

71
00:05:31,904 --> 00:05:32,904
A gift from my friend.

72
00:05:33,344 --> 00:05:33,984
Otherwise,

73
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:35,585
with my meager official salary,

74
00:05:35,864 --> 00:05:37,585
I couldn't afford such fine tea.

75
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:41,825
Knowing

76
00:05:41,825 --> 00:05:43,065
our men in Yezhou Garrison

77
00:05:44,224 --> 00:05:45,745
still lack military pay,

78
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,464
I feel really uneasy

79
00:05:49,185 --> 00:05:52,424
drinking such fine tea.

80
00:05:55,185 --> 00:05:55,864
Commander Xiao,

81
00:05:56,464 --> 00:05:57,825
your words ring true.

82
00:05:58,585 --> 00:05:59,984
Military life is arduous.

83
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:02,585
I share their hardships in spirit.

84
00:06:03,745 --> 00:06:06,424
But Yezhou suffers yearly calamities

85
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:07,945
and poor harvests,

86
00:06:08,464 --> 00:06:10,385
making provisions and pay impossible.

87
00:06:11,265 --> 00:06:11,825
Previously,

88
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,825
border trade supplemented our funds,

89
00:06:14,104 --> 00:06:14,784
but now,

90
00:06:14,784 --> 00:06:16,185
constant clashes with Wutuo

91
00:06:16,304 --> 00:06:17,505
have halted all commerce.

92
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:18,864
Thus

93
00:06:19,265 --> 00:06:20,145
revenues vanished.

94
00:06:20,424 --> 00:06:21,104
No income means

95
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:22,265
people can't pay taxes.

96
00:06:22,344 --> 00:06:23,065
Without taxes,

97
00:06:23,464 --> 00:06:26,065
how can I procure military funds?

98
00:06:30,145 --> 00:06:31,664
Forgive my frankness,

99
00:06:32,864 --> 00:06:35,505
as Yezhou's magistrate,

100
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:37,304
when I think of soldiers

101
00:06:37,424 --> 00:06:38,544
enduring hunger,

102
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:41,705
my heart aches.

103
00:06:42,705 --> 00:06:43,464
If selling myself

104
00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:45,544
could raise funds,

105
00:06:45,945 --> 00:06:47,344
I'd gladly trade myself

106
00:06:47,424 --> 00:06:48,224
for military funds

107
00:06:48,585 --> 00:06:49,864
to support our troops.

108
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:57,464
Your words

109
00:06:57,864 --> 00:06:59,344
are truly moving.

110
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:05,065
Were it not for our garrison

111
00:07:05,145 --> 00:07:06,705
going unpaid for a long time,

112
00:07:07,304 --> 00:07:09,065
I might believe what you said.

113
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:12,825
Master.

114
00:07:13,825 --> 00:07:15,185
Mr. Chu has arrived at the hall.

115
00:07:17,065 --> 00:07:18,185
Mr. Chu has arrived?

116
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:18,928
Yes.

117
00:07:19,224 --> 00:07:20,585
Commander, should we...?

118
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:21,505
Perhaps...

119
00:07:22,304 --> 00:07:22,864
Okay.

120
00:07:23,145 --> 00:07:24,304
I understand your meaning.

121
00:07:24,505 --> 00:07:25,945
Do as you please.

122
00:07:26,065 --> 00:07:27,304
I'll return shortly.

123
00:07:59,185 --> 00:08:00,705
Why does it hurt so much?

124
00:08:13,145 --> 00:08:14,705
(This thing must be poisonous.)

125
00:08:30,104 --> 00:08:31,065
(He hasn't gone far)

126
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,185
(and is still secretly watching me.)

127
00:08:34,664 --> 00:08:35,344
(This poison...)

128
00:08:35,984 --> 00:08:37,385
(He doesn't just want to kill me.)

129
00:08:38,304 --> 00:08:39,265
(And Xiao Jue, too.)

130
00:08:51,784 --> 00:08:52,345
What's up?

131
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,064
Let go.

132
00:08:53,424 --> 00:08:55,025
Someone placed a poisonous ball on me.

133
00:09:24,304 --> 00:09:25,345
Another wasted effort.

134
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:27,184
Another wasted effort.

135
00:09:27,865 --> 00:09:28,664
He...

136
00:09:33,465 --> 00:09:35,584
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

137
00:09:35,904 --> 00:09:36,865
What are you doing?

138
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:38,465
Why not smile?

139
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,064
Why smile?

140
00:09:40,505 --> 00:09:41,225
How can you smile?

141
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,064
Not smiling.

142
00:09:42,064 --> 00:09:43,184
Not smiling? Why not?

143
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:44,505
Why smile?

144
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:45,304
Get lost.

145
00:09:45,465 --> 00:09:46,064
Get lost.

146
00:09:53,824 --> 00:09:54,904
They fell into the water.

147
00:09:55,704 --> 00:09:56,345
They'll wash up

148
00:09:56,505 --> 00:09:57,625
thoroughly.

149
00:09:57,904 --> 00:09:59,225
That scented ball became useless.

150
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,385
Falling into the water
right after we replaced

151
00:10:02,745 --> 00:10:03,745
his scented ball.

152
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,345
This is too much of a coincidence.

153
00:10:09,505 --> 00:10:11,265
He must be faking blindness.

154
00:10:12,424 --> 00:10:13,184
That young man

155
00:10:13,265 --> 00:10:14,824
is truly unnatural.

156
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:18,145
Slippery as a loach,

157
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,625
he's impossible to grasp.

158
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:41,784
My belt!

159
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:44,544
Belt! Where's my belt?

160
00:10:45,505 --> 00:10:46,544
Where's my belt?

161
00:10:46,824 --> 00:10:47,505
Belt.

162
00:10:48,904 --> 00:10:49,625
Uncle!

163
00:10:49,944 --> 00:10:51,505
I can't find my belt.

164
00:10:51,704 --> 00:10:53,145
Could you fetch it for me?

165
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,824
Here.

166
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:29,385
You're so good to me.

167
00:11:31,944 --> 00:11:33,265
You called me uncle, after all.

168
00:11:35,025 --> 00:11:35,664
Uncle,

169
00:11:36,985 --> 00:11:38,064
what about my allowance?

170
00:11:38,784 --> 00:11:39,424
Where is it?

171
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:55,625
It's not worth being your nephew.

172
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,145
You're unlucky to have

173
00:11:58,424 --> 00:11:59,385
a heartless uncle.

174
00:12:00,145 --> 00:12:00,944
Who said that?

175
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,505
You're clearly warm-hearted

176
00:12:02,704 --> 00:12:03,345
and magnanimous.

177
00:12:03,664 --> 00:12:04,584
General Fengyun,

178
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:06,105
as good

179
00:12:06,304 --> 00:12:07,505
as your reputation.

180
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:12,824
Earlier,

181
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:15,184
you really went all out.

182
00:12:16,424 --> 00:12:18,625
I couldn't let you get involved.

183
00:12:19,385 --> 00:12:20,064
Fortunately,

184
00:12:20,385 --> 00:12:21,064
that scented ball

185
00:12:21,265 --> 00:12:22,145
is now useless.

186
00:12:24,784 --> 00:12:25,944
There were many methods,

187
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:28,184
but you chose the most foolish one.

188
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:31,904
It indeed required suffering,

189
00:12:32,424 --> 00:12:32,944
but

190
00:12:33,265 --> 00:12:35,105
it was also undoubtedly the fastest way.

191
00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:42,505
Cold?

192
00:12:53,225 --> 00:12:54,304
Put on your clothes.

193
00:12:55,304 --> 00:12:56,304
If you catch a cold,

194
00:12:57,225 --> 00:12:57,985
I won't care.

195
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:15,625
Ding Yi

196
00:13:16,385 --> 00:13:18,105
is clearly targeting Xiao Jue.

197
00:13:19,304 --> 00:13:20,664
I'll investigate this thoroughly.

198
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,184
You want to kill Cheng Lisu,

199
00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:08,985
but General Feihong

200
00:14:08,985 --> 00:14:10,145
clearly ordered you to take

201
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,424
Xiao Jue's life.

202
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,304
He keeps sabotaging things.

203
00:14:14,784 --> 00:14:15,784
Killing him

204
00:14:16,784 --> 00:14:17,544
would eliminate

205
00:14:17,544 --> 00:14:18,944
Xiao Jue's right-hand man.

206
00:14:20,064 --> 00:14:20,824
Then

207
00:14:21,465 --> 00:14:23,424
matters would become much simpler.

208
00:14:28,145 --> 00:14:30,824
This isn't a bad approach.

209
00:14:32,944 --> 00:14:35,145
I just worry that Xiao Jue...

210
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:41,784
(It was indeed He Rufei.)

211
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:45,225
(But why would He Rufei
want to kill Xiao Jue?)

212
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:06,704
Guards!

213
00:15:06,985 --> 00:15:07,664
Assassin!

214
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:09,985
Assassin! Hurry!

215
00:15:11,312 --> 00:15:11,824
Over here!

216
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:12,944
Hurry!

217
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:39,984
Hurry!

218
00:15:41,168 --> 00:15:41,744
Over here.

219
00:15:42,256 --> 00:15:43,024
Hurry.

220
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,145
Go on.

221
00:16:06,736 --> 00:16:07,280
This way.

222
00:16:07,888 --> 00:16:08,528
Hurry.

223
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,145
(Hide in the Commander's room.)

224
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:33,184
(Why is he bathing at this moment?)

225
00:16:38,985 --> 00:16:40,584
Did I enter the wrong room?

226
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,368
This...

227
00:16:49,184 --> 00:16:49,944
Where am I?

228
00:16:49,944 --> 00:16:52,544
Take off your stealth outfit
before playing these tricks.

229
00:17:03,424 --> 00:17:05,584
Commander Xiao? Are you sleeping?

230
00:17:24,384 --> 00:17:25,705
Trespassing into my room.

231
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:27,384
Is this

232
00:17:28,225 --> 00:17:29,705
how you treat your guests?

233
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:32,185
Sorry, Commander Xiao. A thief entered.

234
00:17:32,505 --> 00:17:35,465
I feared it would disturb you,
so I came to investigate.

235
00:17:36,584 --> 00:17:37,544
You should thoroughly

236
00:17:37,544 --> 00:17:38,505
check every inch

237
00:17:39,265 --> 00:17:41,225
of this room.

238
00:17:41,864 --> 00:17:43,185
You are skilled in martial arts.

239
00:17:43,344 --> 00:17:44,705
Why would you fear a thief?

240
00:17:45,985 --> 00:17:46,864
But

241
00:17:47,384 --> 00:17:49,185
Mr. Cheng lacks skills in martial arts.

242
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:50,745
When I visited his room,

243
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:52,544
he wasn't present.

244
00:17:56,265 --> 00:17:56,905
My nephew

245
00:17:57,745 --> 00:17:58,465
has a fondness

246
00:17:58,465 --> 00:18:00,225
for the pastries
from Shiyunju in Yezhou,

247
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:02,304
so my man took him there.

248
00:18:03,505 --> 00:18:04,176
Is there

249
00:18:06,064 --> 00:18:07,064
a problem with that?

250
00:18:08,945 --> 00:18:09,745
My apologies.

251
00:18:34,624 --> 00:18:35,344
Thank you.

252
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,824
It's lucky

253
00:18:37,824 --> 00:18:39,025
that you bathe daily.

254
00:18:39,505 --> 00:18:40,225
The servants

255
00:18:40,225 --> 00:18:41,304
deliver water every day.

256
00:18:43,505 --> 00:18:44,784
Why was Ding Yi after you?

257
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,505
Why were you wearing

258
00:18:48,025 --> 00:18:49,225
a stealth outfit?

259
00:18:56,665 --> 00:18:57,864
That black-clad figure earlier

260
00:18:58,864 --> 00:18:59,985
was you, right?

261
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:03,465
Why ask questions

262
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:05,225
you know the answers to?

263
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:09,824
Why pretend to be blind?

264
00:19:12,905 --> 00:19:13,624
Not pretending.

265
00:19:14,185 --> 00:19:14,864
It's just

266
00:19:15,344 --> 00:19:16,304
that I'm blessed,

267
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:17,624
so I can recover

268
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,624
slightly faster than others.

269
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:22,144
Significantly faster.

270
00:19:24,905 --> 00:19:26,185
But I was

271
00:19:26,505 --> 00:19:27,344
truly blind

272
00:19:27,384 --> 00:19:28,544
for your sake.

273
00:19:28,784 --> 00:19:30,025
Don't be ungrateful.

274
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:33,225
He Yan.

275
00:19:38,304 --> 00:19:38,945
Get out.

276
00:19:57,064 --> 00:19:58,425
(Why would He Rufei send someone)

277
00:19:58,425 --> 00:19:59,784
(to assassinate Xiao Jue?)

278
00:20:00,705 --> 00:20:01,985
(What is he truly after?)

279
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:04,025
(No.)

280
00:20:04,824 --> 00:20:05,784
(I can't just wait.)

281
00:20:19,945 --> 00:20:21,864
You want to kill Cheng Lisu,

282
00:20:22,745 --> 00:20:23,705
but General Feihong

283
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:24,784
clearly ordered you to take

284
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,144
Xiao Jue's life.

285
00:20:26,544 --> 00:20:28,584
He keeps sabotaging things.

286
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:30,784
Killing him

287
00:20:31,384 --> 00:20:32,104
would cut off

288
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:33,624
Xiao Jue's right-hand man.

289
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:34,985
Then

290
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:38,225
matters would become much simpler.

291
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,304
(Sun Xiangfu's servant)

292
00:20:40,945 --> 00:20:42,384
(is actually He Rufei's man?)

293
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:44,864
(The delay in rescue at Mingshui,)

294
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,144
(the political betrayal in court,)

295
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,144
(and the assassination in Yezhou.)

296
00:20:50,705 --> 00:20:51,624
(He Rufei,)

297
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:53,745
(in my memory,)

298
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:56,144
(you weren't this treacherous.)

299
00:20:57,225 --> 00:20:59,144
(What corrupted you so?)

300
00:21:01,144 --> 00:21:03,104
(Or did I misjudge you from the start?)

301
00:21:03,505 --> 00:21:05,185
(Was this your true nature?)

302
00:21:06,185 --> 00:21:07,025
(Besides,)

303
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:13,144
(what role)

304
00:21:14,265 --> 00:21:16,225
(does she play in this?)

305
00:21:35,505 --> 00:21:36,185
Young Master,

306
00:21:36,344 --> 00:21:37,344
someone was eavesdropping

307
00:21:37,344 --> 00:21:38,824
on Sun Xiangfu and Ding Yi's talk.

308
00:21:39,425 --> 00:21:40,344
Ding Yi chased him

309
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:41,384
to Xiao Jue's room.

310
00:21:42,064 --> 00:21:44,185
Xiao Jue happened
to be bathing at the time.

311
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:45,745
Perfect timing.

312
00:21:46,584 --> 00:21:47,505
Yeah, perfect timing.

313
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:49,945
Xiao Jue must already know by now

314
00:21:50,144 --> 00:21:51,064
He Rufei sent Ding Yi

315
00:21:51,064 --> 00:21:51,945
to kill him.

316
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,104
Let him know.

317
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:54,665
After all, He Rufei

318
00:21:54,945 --> 00:21:55,864
is the one who did it.

319
00:21:59,544 --> 00:22:00,185
Young Master,

320
00:22:00,544 --> 00:22:01,705
you've been reading so long.

321
00:22:02,265 --> 00:22:03,025
Have a rest

322
00:22:03,185 --> 00:22:03,945
and have some soup.

323
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:06,584
This goji and fish soup is
good for the eyes.

324
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:07,544
Alright.

325
00:22:29,344 --> 00:22:29,864
Who's there?

326
00:22:46,985 --> 00:22:48,265
Trying to act mysterious?

327
00:22:48,905 --> 00:22:50,544
Today, I'll send you to the grave.

328
00:22:50,864 --> 00:22:52,465
Let me be the one to send you off.

329
00:22:53,104 --> 00:22:53,864
In your next life,

330
00:22:54,425 --> 00:22:56,584
don't collude with wicked people again.

331
00:22:57,104 --> 00:22:58,945
(That voice belongs to Cheng Lisu.)

332
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:04,985
What?

333
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,344
Can't you recognize me?

334
00:23:07,064 --> 00:23:08,144
Who exactly are you?

335
00:23:13,784 --> 00:23:15,025
You're not Cheng Lisu.

336
00:23:15,824 --> 00:23:17,025
He has no martial skills.

337
00:23:17,344 --> 00:23:18,185
Who do you think

338
00:23:18,584 --> 00:23:19,425
I am?

339
00:23:20,624 --> 00:23:21,745
No matter who you are,

340
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,505
today, you'll be killed.

341
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:00,584
You've really chosen

342
00:24:00,584 --> 00:24:02,784
a fine burial spot for yourself.

343
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:05,784
This place is used by the Sun family

344
00:24:05,985 --> 00:24:07,784
to suppress vengeful souls.

345
00:24:08,384 --> 00:24:09,344
Each Buddha statue

346
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:10,905
represents a vengeful soul.

347
00:24:11,465 --> 00:24:12,344
Soon,

348
00:24:12,945 --> 00:24:15,025
you'll become one of them,

349
00:24:15,864 --> 00:24:17,465
being trapped for eternity.

350
00:24:18,505 --> 00:24:19,945
I'm a vengeful ghost crawling out

351
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:21,104
from the Netherworld.

352
00:24:21,784 --> 00:24:23,104
I care nothing for reincarnation.

353
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:24,304
Besides,

354
00:24:24,584 --> 00:24:25,824
if I can come and go freely,

355
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:27,665
these paper charms and clay statues

356
00:24:27,985 --> 00:24:29,544
are just worthless objects.

357
00:24:30,425 --> 00:24:31,384
They mean nothing.

358
00:26:35,384 --> 00:26:35,985
Don't close it.

359
00:26:37,665 --> 00:26:39,064
Let me watch

360
00:26:39,584 --> 00:26:40,824
how this storm

361
00:26:40,905 --> 00:26:41,945
will wash over the world.

362
00:26:45,584 --> 00:26:46,544
Let's make Sun Mansion

363
00:26:46,784 --> 00:26:47,665
descend into chaos.

364
00:26:48,304 --> 00:26:50,064
The more chaos, the better for you.

365
00:26:50,945 --> 00:26:51,864
I wonder what role

366
00:26:52,465 --> 00:26:53,905
Mr. He will play

367
00:26:54,665 --> 00:26:55,665
in this game.

368
00:27:06,864 --> 00:27:07,985
Does your master He Rufei

369
00:27:09,265 --> 00:27:10,945
know about your incompetence?

370
00:27:14,225 --> 00:27:14,864
Ding Yi.

371
00:27:15,905 --> 00:27:17,265
I won't fall for

372
00:27:17,384 --> 00:27:18,304
the same person twice.

373
00:27:19,064 --> 00:27:19,945
Today,

374
00:27:21,064 --> 00:27:22,745
it's my turn to send you to the grave.

375
00:27:24,104 --> 00:27:25,624
Let's see if you can earn rebirth.

376
00:27:27,425 --> 00:27:28,544
Who exactly are you?

377
00:27:34,665 --> 00:27:35,665
You once killed

378
00:27:36,384 --> 00:27:37,824
a blind woman.

379
00:27:39,665 --> 00:27:41,185
Who do you think I am?

380
00:27:42,384 --> 00:27:43,624
He Yan.

381
00:27:46,225 --> 00:27:47,064
But

382
00:27:47,425 --> 00:27:48,784
if you tell me

383
00:27:49,665 --> 00:27:51,505
why He Rufei wants Xiao Jue dead,

384
00:27:52,824 --> 00:27:54,465
I'll make your death quick.

385
00:27:56,225 --> 00:27:57,705
Do you care about Xiao Jue that much?

386
00:27:59,465 --> 00:28:00,344
We are companions

387
00:28:01,144 --> 00:28:02,864
who've survived
life-and-death situations.

388
00:28:03,304 --> 00:28:04,225
Of course I care.

389
00:28:06,824 --> 00:28:07,945
Even if I die,

390
00:28:08,905 --> 00:28:10,104
I'll never betray

391
00:28:10,185 --> 00:28:10,945
my general.

392
00:28:15,025 --> 00:28:16,665
Since you won't talk,

393
00:28:17,265 --> 00:28:18,784
go tell the God of Death.

394
00:28:23,624 --> 00:28:25,784
I'm a ghost of the one you murdered.

395
00:28:26,745 --> 00:28:28,544
I clawed my way out of the Netherworld,

396
00:28:29,905 --> 00:28:31,745
and came here to claim your life.

397
00:28:44,144 --> 00:28:45,265
Who exactly are you?

398
00:28:53,104 --> 00:28:53,665
Commander.

399
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,384
What do you mean by that?

400
00:28:55,705 --> 00:28:57,665
I have pretended
to be Cheng Lisu for a few days.

401
00:28:57,824 --> 00:28:58,745
Don't you recognize me?

402
00:28:59,185 --> 00:29:00,144
I'm He Yan.

403
00:29:04,265 --> 00:29:05,265
What did you mean

404
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:07,784
by "I'm a ghost of the one

405
00:29:09,104 --> 00:29:10,064
you murdered"?

406
00:29:12,104 --> 00:29:14,465
I was just trying to scare Ding Yi.

407
00:29:17,225 --> 00:29:18,584
Still refusing to tell the truth?

408
00:29:19,745 --> 00:29:20,745
Miss He.

409
00:29:24,945 --> 00:29:25,905
You're clearly a woman,

410
00:29:26,985 --> 00:29:28,584
yet registered under a male identity

411
00:29:29,465 --> 00:29:30,705
to join Yezhou Garrison.

412
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,265
May I ask you

413
00:29:33,864 --> 00:29:35,025
what your intentions are?

414
00:29:36,144 --> 00:29:36,864
Commander.

415
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:38,505
When did you find out?

416
00:29:41,425 --> 00:29:42,025
I thought

417
00:29:42,104 --> 00:29:43,905
you were a spy sent by He Rufei.

418
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:47,624
But you just killed his man.

419
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:53,185
So why exactly

420
00:29:54,265 --> 00:29:56,705
did you hide your identity
to join Yezhou Garrison?

421
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,144
If you tell the truth,

422
00:29:59,624 --> 00:30:01,624
I'll consider letting you
join the battalion.

423
00:30:02,304 --> 00:30:03,344
(A trap?)

424
00:30:03,705 --> 00:30:04,584
(I don't buy it.)

425
00:30:06,985 --> 00:30:07,505
Commander.

426
00:30:07,905 --> 00:30:08,745
Are you serious?

427
00:30:12,265 --> 00:30:13,185
My registration

428
00:30:13,384 --> 00:30:14,784
is true.

429
00:30:15,304 --> 00:30:16,185
But when my mother

430
00:30:16,985 --> 00:30:18,304
was pregnant with me,

431
00:30:18,745 --> 00:30:20,025
she met a wise seer.

432
00:30:21,025 --> 00:30:22,025
The seer said

433
00:30:22,344 --> 00:30:24,064
if she bore a son,

434
00:30:24,784 --> 00:30:26,144
he'd be a military prodigy.

435
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:27,544
But if it were a girl,

436
00:30:28,505 --> 00:30:29,705
she would die early.

437
00:30:30,505 --> 00:30:31,784
That's why since birth,

438
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,104
I've been raised as a boy.

439
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:35,344
So the registry

440
00:30:35,945 --> 00:30:37,104
listed me as male.

441
00:30:38,425 --> 00:30:39,304
By that logic,

442
00:30:40,144 --> 00:30:40,945
the Fuyue Army moves

443
00:30:40,945 --> 00:30:42,945
you demonstrated while taming horses

444
00:30:43,945 --> 00:30:44,985
were also taught to you

445
00:30:45,225 --> 00:30:46,425
by this seer in your dreams?

446
00:30:48,384 --> 00:30:49,505
Not exactly.

447
00:30:50,304 --> 00:30:51,824
Living as a boy,

448
00:30:52,344 --> 00:30:53,104
I naturally aspired

449
00:30:53,465 --> 00:30:54,544
to become a general

450
00:30:54,864 --> 00:30:55,745
and make my mark.

451
00:30:56,225 --> 00:30:57,225
Just like you, Commander.

452
00:31:00,745 --> 00:31:02,225
After joining the Fuyue Army,

453
00:31:02,824 --> 00:31:04,624
I achieved some success.

454
00:31:05,425 --> 00:31:06,104
Unfortunately,

455
00:31:06,544 --> 00:31:08,225
my squad leader discovered my identity.

456
00:31:08,624 --> 00:31:10,104
Luckily, he was kind

457
00:31:10,584 --> 00:31:11,864
and didn't expose me.

458
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:13,144
But

459
00:31:13,384 --> 00:31:14,344
he feared implication,

460
00:31:14,384 --> 00:31:15,705
so he made me

461
00:31:16,104 --> 00:31:18,025
claim injury to retire

462
00:31:18,185 --> 00:31:19,104
and return home.

463
00:31:23,722 --> 00:31:28,784
(Exsoldier in the Fuyue Army, He Yan
retired after injuries half a year ago.)

464
00:31:28,784 --> 00:31:30,225
(Thankfully, Master forged)

465
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,304
(my registry thoroughly.)

466
00:31:34,584 --> 00:31:35,185
Commander.

467
00:31:35,304 --> 00:31:35,864
Well,

468
00:31:36,064 --> 00:31:37,104
I've answered all.

469
00:31:37,344 --> 00:31:38,025
Don't you think

470
00:31:38,344 --> 00:31:39,384
I'm now qualified

471
00:31:39,425 --> 00:31:40,304
to join the battalion?

472
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,104
If your identity was exposed before,

473
00:31:42,665 --> 00:31:43,985
why enlist again?

474
00:31:44,544 --> 00:31:45,784
What if the past repeats?

475
00:31:47,425 --> 00:31:48,745
I want to be a general

476
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,225
and protect my country.

477
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:52,985
Moreover, I trust

478
00:31:53,064 --> 00:31:53,824
the Xiao Army

479
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:55,945
won't dwell on trivialities,

480
00:31:56,745 --> 00:31:57,824
but value true talent

481
00:31:58,945 --> 00:32:00,225
and give me a fair chance.

482
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:18,905
Keep up.

483
00:32:19,985 --> 00:32:21,265
The corpse...

484
00:32:21,985 --> 00:32:22,824
Let Feinu handle it.

485
00:32:25,225 --> 00:32:25,784
Commander.

486
00:32:26,465 --> 00:32:27,384
Why walk so fast?

487
00:32:28,225 --> 00:32:29,425
Waiting to get caught?

488
00:32:48,025 --> 00:32:48,624
Commander.

489
00:32:49,584 --> 00:32:50,584
Help me apply medicine.

490
00:32:50,945 --> 00:32:51,665
I can't reach it.

491
00:32:53,784 --> 00:32:54,624
You're playing a man,

492
00:32:55,465 --> 00:32:56,745
but not a real man.

493
00:32:58,344 --> 00:32:59,465
You're a noble man,

494
00:33:00,025 --> 00:33:01,384
so I trust you completely.

495
00:33:26,224 --> 00:33:26,745
Commander.

496
00:33:27,144 --> 00:33:28,225
Could you be gentler?

497
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,064
I'm made of flesh and blood.

498
00:33:32,265 --> 00:33:33,265
Now you feel pain?

499
00:33:33,705 --> 00:33:34,985
Weren't you tough earlier?

500
00:33:36,624 --> 00:33:38,344
Different circumstances.

501
00:33:38,705 --> 00:33:39,985
On the battlefield,

502
00:33:40,265 --> 00:33:41,304
as a soldier,

503
00:33:41,465 --> 00:33:42,624
even with my last breath,

504
00:33:42,985 --> 00:33:44,144
I'd fight to the end.

505
00:33:44,864 --> 00:33:45,864
Now, during peace,

506
00:33:45,985 --> 00:33:48,544
I should properly recuperate.

507
00:33:49,705 --> 00:33:51,064
Your reading paid off.

508
00:33:52,505 --> 00:33:53,705
Though I'm a woman,

509
00:33:54,425 --> 00:33:55,985
my military tactics and martial skills

510
00:33:56,104 --> 00:33:57,025
rival any man's.

511
00:33:57,425 --> 00:33:58,265
I believe

512
00:33:58,584 --> 00:33:59,864
you've witnessed it firsthand.

513
00:34:05,185 --> 00:34:05,905
Why did you

514
00:34:06,985 --> 00:34:07,985
fight with

515
00:34:08,025 --> 00:34:08,624
He Rufei's man?

516
00:34:14,184 --> 00:34:16,104
It was all for you, Commander.

517
00:34:18,664 --> 00:34:19,345
For me?

518
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:21,465
Exactly.

519
00:34:21,825 --> 00:34:23,224
I overheard someone plotting

520
00:34:23,505 --> 00:34:24,425
to kill you.

521
00:34:24,785 --> 00:34:25,905
As your subordinate,

522
00:34:26,224 --> 00:34:26,985
it's my duty

523
00:34:27,144 --> 00:34:28,465
to eliminate all threats to you.

524
00:34:29,104 --> 00:34:29,785
So I decided

525
00:34:29,865 --> 00:34:30,945
to investigate covertly.

526
00:34:31,224 --> 00:34:32,744
But someone spotted me.

527
00:34:33,184 --> 00:34:34,985
He tried to silence me.

528
00:34:35,385 --> 00:34:36,345
Every strike was lethal.

529
00:34:36,664 --> 00:34:37,825
I couldn't hold back.

530
00:34:38,345 --> 00:34:39,025
After all,

531
00:34:39,385 --> 00:34:40,825
I need to keep myself alive

532
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,104
to serve you.

533
00:34:53,264 --> 00:34:54,184
Commander,

534
00:34:55,945 --> 00:34:56,905
do you still not believe

535
00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:57,785
what I'm saying?

536
00:34:58,505 --> 00:34:59,544
My loyalty to you

537
00:34:59,865 --> 00:35:01,025
is truer than gold.

538
00:35:01,624 --> 00:35:03,104
Every word comes from my heart.

539
00:35:03,664 --> 00:35:04,184
I swear it.

540
00:35:07,224 --> 00:35:08,624
Stay still. I'm not done.

541
00:35:20,025 --> 00:35:20,584
Commander,

542
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:23,425
can I join the battalion now?

543
00:35:28,425 --> 00:35:29,305
Why are you

544
00:35:30,624 --> 00:35:31,905
so fixated on

545
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:34,624
joining the battalion?

546
00:35:48,985 --> 00:35:49,584
Obviously,

547
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:51,064
it's because I admire you.

548
00:35:52,064 --> 00:35:53,144
I want to achieve greatness

549
00:35:53,865 --> 00:35:54,704
under your command.

550
00:35:55,505 --> 00:35:56,025
Commander,

551
00:35:56,744 --> 00:35:58,025
everyone in your battalion

552
00:35:58,345 --> 00:35:59,064
earned their place

553
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,104
through genuine skills.

554
00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:02,305
You value merit above all.

555
00:36:02,985 --> 00:36:03,664
That's why

556
00:36:04,465 --> 00:36:05,985
I sought to join your ranks,

557
00:36:06,744 --> 00:36:07,465
to prove

558
00:36:07,945 --> 00:36:08,985
no matter one's status

559
00:36:09,465 --> 00:36:10,345
or gender,

560
00:36:10,945 --> 00:36:12,184
anyone can achieve greatness

561
00:36:12,664 --> 00:36:13,544
and serve the nation.

562
00:36:14,624 --> 00:36:15,305
Where there is

563
00:36:15,985 --> 00:36:16,744
a will,

564
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,264
there's a way.

565
00:36:18,865 --> 00:36:19,704
Someday,

566
00:36:20,624 --> 00:36:22,025
I'll become a renowned general.

567
00:36:25,385 --> 00:36:26,224
Your speech

568
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:27,905
was flawless

569
00:36:28,425 --> 00:36:29,465
and quite convincing.

570
00:36:30,544 --> 00:36:31,280
But

571
00:36:32,544 --> 00:36:33,785
do you think I'll believe that?

572
00:36:34,505 --> 00:36:35,624
If you don't tell the truth,

573
00:36:36,345 --> 00:36:37,544
then leave Yezhou Garrison.

574
00:36:38,104 --> 00:36:39,224
You can't go back

575
00:36:39,385 --> 00:36:40,385
on your word!

576
00:36:42,544 --> 00:36:43,624
If you're not honest,

577
00:36:44,064 --> 00:36:45,785
don't demand honesty from others.

578
00:36:46,985 --> 00:36:48,184
If you expel me,

579
00:36:48,224 --> 00:36:49,104
you'll regret it.

580
00:36:50,025 --> 00:36:50,785
Regret?

581
00:36:51,785 --> 00:36:52,505
I admit

582
00:36:52,664 --> 00:36:53,465
you have talent,

583
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:55,224
but the Nine Banners Battalion

584
00:36:56,025 --> 00:36:57,345
is full of talented people.

585
00:36:59,025 --> 00:37:00,104
I can't even stay

586
00:37:00,425 --> 00:37:01,704
in Yezhou Garrison much longer.

587
00:37:02,465 --> 00:37:03,064
In short,

588
00:37:04,064 --> 00:37:05,144
if you drive me away,

589
00:37:06,505 --> 00:37:07,264
I'll spread rumors

590
00:37:07,664 --> 00:37:08,785
that you have a sweetheart.

591
00:37:10,825 --> 00:37:11,544
After all,

592
00:37:11,905 --> 00:37:13,264
everyone knows you avoid

593
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:14,584
romantic entanglements.

594
00:37:19,825 --> 00:37:22,104
Go ahead. Who'd believe such nonsense?

595
00:37:22,465 --> 00:37:23,425
Words aren't convincing,

596
00:37:24,064 --> 00:37:25,144
but I have evidence.

597
00:37:26,305 --> 00:37:26,905
Commander,

598
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:28,505
I happen to know

599
00:37:29,184 --> 00:37:30,584
you have a red mole

600
00:37:31,544 --> 00:37:32,544
an inch above your waist.

601
00:37:33,624 --> 00:37:34,704
Only an intimate partner

602
00:37:35,425 --> 00:37:36,744
would know

603
00:37:36,985 --> 00:37:38,224
such private details.

604
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,664
Nonsense.

605
00:37:48,385 --> 00:37:49,425
It's not nonsense.

606
00:37:51,664 --> 00:37:52,505
Commander,

607
00:37:52,825 --> 00:37:54,064
your looks are exceptional,

608
00:37:54,465 --> 00:37:56,144
and even that charming mole

609
00:37:56,385 --> 00:37:58,264
is perfectly placed

610
00:37:58,584 --> 00:37:59,825
and cute.

611
00:38:00,624 --> 00:38:01,544
It makes people

612
00:38:01,945 --> 00:38:03,144
hard to forget.

613
00:38:04,425 --> 00:38:05,305
- You...
- Commander.

614
00:38:05,905 --> 00:38:06,744
There's something.

615
00:38:08,385 --> 00:38:09,104
Mr. Feinu,

616
00:38:09,264 --> 00:38:10,184
come in.

617
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:13,985
What is it?

618
00:38:14,184 --> 00:38:15,224
This is my room.

619
00:38:29,785 --> 00:38:31,985
What is it you want to tell me?

620
00:38:33,825 --> 00:38:34,345
Commander.

621
00:38:34,985 --> 00:38:36,144
As you instructed,

622
00:38:36,465 --> 00:38:37,825
I buried the body in the shrine

623
00:38:38,104 --> 00:38:38,825
and left clues

624
00:38:39,144 --> 00:38:40,345
to see Sun Xiangfu's reaction.

625
00:38:41,184 --> 00:38:42,584
But while burying the body,

626
00:38:43,264 --> 00:38:44,865
I discovered something there.

627
00:38:49,945 --> 00:38:50,544
Commander.

628
00:38:50,945 --> 00:38:52,144
Perhaps you should go see it.

629
00:39:17,505 --> 00:39:18,104
