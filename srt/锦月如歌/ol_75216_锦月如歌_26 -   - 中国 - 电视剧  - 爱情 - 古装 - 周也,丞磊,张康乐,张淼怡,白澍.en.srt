Come on.

24
00:01:50,915 --> 00:01:51,755
Thank you.

25
00:01:52,594 --> 00:01:53,434
Thank you.

26
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,154
Take your time.

27
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,275
(This is)

28
00:01:56,275 --> 00:01:57,635
(tragic reality in this city.)

29
00:01:58,554 --> 00:01:59,394
(It seems we must)

30
00:01:59,394 --> 00:02:00,594
(think of an idea quickly)

31
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:01,835
(to repel the Wutuo.)

32
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:02,675
Is this enough?

33
00:02:04,195 --> 00:02:05,035
General Wu'an,

34
00:02:05,755 --> 00:02:06,635
the congee is shared.

35
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:08,595
By the way, Ms. Qi Luo,

36
00:02:09,394 --> 00:02:10,355
didn't we send people

37
00:02:10,435 --> 00:02:12,355
to inform their families
to pick them up?

38
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:14,714
Why hasn't anyone returned home?

39
00:02:14,954 --> 00:02:16,035
They were abducted

40
00:02:16,635 --> 00:02:17,514
and violated.

41
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:20,274
Their families think they're a disgrace,

42
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,514
refusing to take them back.

43
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:25,794
This calamity wasn't their choice.

44
00:02:26,554 --> 00:02:28,075
They've narrowly escaped death,

45
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:29,755
but their families bar the door.

46
00:02:30,554 --> 00:02:31,875
How ridiculous.

47
00:02:32,475 --> 00:02:33,755
If they were men,

48
00:02:34,514 --> 00:02:35,435
they'd already be home

49
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:36,954
with their families.

50
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:39,794
Maybe even praised as heroes.

51
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:41,915
How could that be heroic?

52
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:43,155
True heroes like you.

53
00:02:43,432 --> 00:02:44,635
Protecting homes and citizens.

54
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:45,994
That's real heroism.

55
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:47,915
And my master.

56
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,274
You two

57
00:02:49,274 --> 00:02:51,554
are both great heroes
defending Wei's people.

58
00:02:54,114 --> 00:02:55,595
I won't claim to be a hero.

59
00:02:56,355 --> 00:02:57,195
As for Li Kuang,

60
00:02:58,504 --> 00:03:00,035
heroes don't follow the crowd

61
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:03,435
or push suffering people
deeper into despair.

62
00:03:04,035 --> 00:03:05,475
Nor would they save rations

63
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,514
by starving those they should protect.

64
00:03:09,075 --> 00:03:11,114
Are you blaming my master?

65
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:13,394
He has his difficulties.

66
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:15,234
The city's food reserves are low.

67
00:03:15,435 --> 00:03:16,755
He's deeply concerned.

68
00:03:16,954 --> 00:03:17,794
So...

69
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:19,995
Ms. Qi Luo,

70
00:03:20,155 --> 00:03:20,995
are you alright?

71
00:03:21,514 --> 00:03:22,514
I have some ointment.

72
00:03:22,755 --> 00:03:23,595
I'll get it for you.

73
00:03:23,674 --> 00:03:25,875
These minor injuries are nothing.

74
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:27,355
Don't blame my master.

75
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:29,195
He's actually kind-hearted.

76
00:03:29,994 --> 00:03:31,755
He saved me from street thugs

77
00:03:32,274 --> 00:03:33,274
and gave me food

78
00:03:33,994 --> 00:03:35,755
and shelter.

79
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:37,075
Ms. Qi Luo,

80
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:39,195
is this what 'good' means?

81
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:40,715
He married you.

82
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:42,755
Shouldn't he care for you?

83
00:03:43,435 --> 00:03:44,674
In these chaotic times,

84
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:45,915
as a woman,

85
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,394
I belong to him.

86
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:49,915
It's my duty to serve him well,

87
00:03:50,475 --> 00:03:52,155
respect him, obey him,

88
00:03:52,394 --> 00:03:53,674
and make him my universe.

89
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:54,715
Slow down.

90
00:03:55,114 --> 00:03:55,954
Be careful.

91
00:03:57,475 --> 00:03:58,315
Is this better?

92
00:04:03,475 --> 00:04:04,315
Master.

93
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:06,075
I'm scared.

94
00:04:06,755 --> 00:04:08,075
I don't want to go.

95
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:10,794
I only want to stay with you.

96
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,755
I don't want to be anyone's example.

97
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,034
Rundu must not fall to Wutuo.

98
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:19,354
As Rundu's defender,

99
00:04:20,354 --> 00:04:22,315
I'll protect it even
at the cost of my life.

100
00:04:23,594 --> 00:04:25,354
But with our current forces,

101
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:26,834
we stand no chance.

102
00:04:27,154 --> 00:04:28,235
We must burn our boats

103
00:04:28,354 --> 00:04:29,194
and fight them

104
00:04:29,195 --> 00:04:30,115
to the bitter end!

105
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:32,994
You and those female captives
are vanguards.

106
00:04:33,235 --> 00:04:35,154
After you distract the Wutuo forces,

107
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:37,235
I'll lead the army to battle

108
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:39,235
and die defending Rundu.

109
00:04:50,235 --> 00:04:51,315
I understand now.

110
00:04:57,354 --> 00:04:58,514
I'll go.

111
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:02,555
Please take care.

112
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:07,154
He, He.

113
00:05:09,155 --> 00:05:10,834
Mai and I heard something

114
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:11,674
on our way here.

115
00:05:11,994 --> 00:05:12,834
Li Kuang

116
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:14,248
plans to send the women we rescued

117
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:15,795
to the battlefield

118
00:05:15,795 --> 00:05:16,875
to fight the enemies!

119
00:05:18,914 --> 00:05:20,514
He's sending them to die!

120
00:05:24,954 --> 00:05:25,794
Let's go.

121
00:05:45,115 --> 00:05:46,154
Tainted by the enemy.

122
00:05:47,034 --> 00:05:48,154
Disgrace to the family.

123
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:50,834
Not worthy to live.

124
00:05:52,474 --> 00:05:53,394
Not worthy to live.

125
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:03,874
Mr. Wang,

126
00:06:04,315 --> 00:06:05,474
as the Military Director,

127
00:06:05,914 --> 00:06:07,154
I can command you.

128
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:08,874
By my order,

129
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,075
do not open the gate.

130
00:06:11,795 --> 00:06:12,635
Mr. Chu.

131
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:14,435
All hangs on this move.

132
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,115
But I serve Rundu's garrison.

133
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:19,394
We only obey Commander Li's orders.

134
00:06:20,954 --> 00:06:21,794
Open the gate.

135
00:06:23,995 --> 00:06:24,835
Mr. Wang!

136
00:06:29,274 --> 00:06:30,354
Open the gate!

137
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,795
Let me see who will open it!

138
00:07:10,315 --> 00:07:11,755
This is Rundu.

139
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:14,034
I'm General Wu'an
appointed by His Majesty.

140
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:15,914
Not under your jurisdiction.

141
00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:19,354
I'm not your soldier.

142
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:30,354
Lure the enemy?

143
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:31,874
Commander Li.

144
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,394
You're just sacrificing lives.

145
00:07:34,195 --> 00:07:35,035
General Wu'an.

146
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:36,635
Your contributions to Rundu

147
00:07:36,954 --> 00:07:38,235
are deeply appreciated.

148
00:07:38,755 --> 00:07:39,635
But even so,

149
00:07:39,795 --> 00:07:41,595
you can't interfere in
our military affairs.

150
00:07:42,435 --> 00:07:44,315
If you overstep again,

151
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,595
just leave Rundu.

152
00:07:45,754 --> 00:07:47,434
You're the one who should leave!

153
00:07:49,995 --> 00:07:50,875
Please calm down.

154
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,675
Don't blame Commander Li.

155
00:07:55,394 --> 00:07:56,234
We

156
00:07:56,675 --> 00:07:57,594
volunteered.

157
00:07:58,795 --> 00:07:59,635
We are

158
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:01,274
defiled.

159
00:08:02,075 --> 00:08:03,635
No dignity to keep living.

160
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,435
If our deaths

161
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:08,514
can gain Rundu an advantage,

162
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:10,834
we'll cleanse our shame

163
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:12,594
and die with honor.

164
00:08:13,195 --> 00:08:14,954
Commander Li
entrusted us with this task.

165
00:08:15,354 --> 00:08:16,514
He's giving us chances.

166
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:18,715
If we can

167
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:20,474
deceive the Wutuo enemies

168
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:21,755
and make them believe

169
00:08:21,755 --> 00:08:22,995
Rundu has no fighters left,

170
00:08:23,474 --> 00:08:25,115
we'll gain an advantage

171
00:08:25,514 --> 00:08:26,354
and strike them

172
00:08:26,354 --> 00:08:27,474
unprepared at the showdown.

173
00:08:27,914 --> 00:08:28,754
Chances?

174
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:30,795
So I'm blocking your way to merit?

175
00:08:34,634 --> 00:08:35,474
Yes.

176
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:37,114
In crisis,

177
00:08:37,915 --> 00:08:39,435
we should unite

178
00:08:39,634 --> 00:08:40,555
against foes.

179
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,035
But not by sending you
to die pointlessly.

180
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:44,675
This isn't courage.

181
00:08:45,114 --> 00:08:45,994
This is foolishness.

182
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:47,354
Watch your words!

183
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:49,995
Li Kuang,

184
00:08:50,474 --> 00:08:51,834
as Rundu's commander,

185
00:08:52,594 --> 00:08:55,435
you point blades
at your women and people.

186
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:56,915
What's this?

187
00:08:57,634 --> 00:08:58,634
They volunteered.

188
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:00,555
Their sortie

189
00:09:00,594 --> 00:09:02,355
is to deceive the enemy and buy time.

190
00:09:02,994 --> 00:09:05,435
As the Rundu commander,
I'll lead the charge

191
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:07,834
and fight to the death
defending this city.

192
00:09:08,474 --> 00:09:09,874
Better die meaningfully

193
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:11,354
than live in shame.

194
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:13,915
Volunteered?

195
00:09:16,114 --> 00:09:16,954
Let me ask you.

196
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:19,594
Are you truly willing?

197
00:09:24,395 --> 00:09:25,874
I... I...

198
00:09:26,555 --> 00:09:27,834
I don't want to die.

199
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,954
I want to live with dignity.

200
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,195
You shouldn't feel ashamed.

201
00:09:36,874 --> 00:09:37,915
Shame belongs to

202
00:09:38,395 --> 00:09:39,634
Commander Li.

203
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:44,995
Li Kuang.

204
00:09:45,195 --> 00:09:46,275
Did they volunteer

205
00:09:46,714 --> 00:09:48,675
or were they forced to do this?

206
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:50,634
You know the truth.

207
00:09:51,075 --> 00:09:53,435
Aren't they Rundu's citizens?

208
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,035
As the city's commander,

209
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:57,395
you make

210
00:09:57,395 --> 00:09:59,634
those you should protect die needlessly.

211
00:10:02,114 --> 00:10:02,954
Swords

212
00:10:03,795 --> 00:10:05,155
are for enemies.

213
00:10:05,994 --> 00:10:07,754
Never against the weak.

214
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:11,155
Yes.

215
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,354
Never against the weak.

216
00:10:24,795 --> 00:10:25,635
Commander.

217
00:10:33,994 --> 00:10:35,315
You haven't changed.

218
00:10:36,395 --> 00:10:37,315
General Zhang

219
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:39,915
used a few citizens as bait.

220
00:10:40,954 --> 00:10:42,275
It lacked compassion.

221
00:10:42,954 --> 00:10:44,714
But compared to losing the city,

222
00:10:45,195 --> 00:10:48,594
it was minor.

223
00:10:49,035 --> 00:10:52,195
So, in a crisis, we must
make such a trade-off.

224
00:10:54,435 --> 00:10:55,275
Sir,

225
00:10:55,675 --> 00:10:57,075
but I hold a different view.

226
00:10:57,915 --> 00:10:59,395
I understand General Zhang.

227
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:00,915
But if it were me,

228
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:02,714
I would never act this way.

229
00:11:03,275 --> 00:11:04,834
I'd lead the remaining soldiers

230
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:06,035
to fight the rebels

231
00:11:06,435 --> 00:11:07,915
at the city gates.

232
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:10,234
The one who wields the sword

233
00:11:10,634 --> 00:11:11,474
must know

234
00:11:11,874 --> 00:11:13,874
whether the blade is meant

235
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,315
for the enemy in front

236
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:18,435
or the weak behind them.

237
00:11:21,354 --> 00:11:23,195
I will never draw
my sword against the weak.

238
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:39,555
C-C-Commander Xiao's here? How?

239
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:41,954
Do you think

240
00:11:42,394 --> 00:11:43,234
it's because of...?

241
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:44,994
Because of our absence from camp,

242
00:11:45,474 --> 00:11:46,314
he came to punish us?

243
00:11:47,714 --> 00:11:49,795
No, that can't be it.

244
00:11:50,315 --> 00:11:51,474
He seems in good spirits.

245
00:11:52,195 --> 00:11:53,075
He even smiled.

246
00:11:54,234 --> 00:11:55,074
Really?

247
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:56,234
Absolutely true.

248
00:11:56,874 --> 00:12:00,395
D-D-Don't worry.

249
00:12:00,395 --> 00:12:01,994
S-S-Stop mocking me.

250
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:04,314
General Fengyun,

251
00:12:04,795 --> 00:12:05,635
how did you get in?

252
00:12:06,234 --> 00:12:07,155
I fought my way through

253
00:12:07,714 --> 00:12:08,675
with my battalion.

254
00:12:10,155 --> 00:12:11,714
Commander Xiao, it must be hard work.

255
00:12:14,795 --> 00:12:15,635
Commander Li,

256
00:12:16,714 --> 00:12:18,354
General Wu'an is my man.

257
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,675
My soldiers' discipline

258
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:22,435
is my own responsibility.

259
00:12:22,954 --> 00:12:24,354
No outsiders may interfere.

260
00:12:25,354 --> 00:12:26,195
Besides,

261
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:28,235
he wasn't wrong.

262
00:12:32,275 --> 00:12:34,675
I know I'm the one at fault.

263
00:12:34,714 --> 00:12:36,515
But I'm ready to die defending Rundu.

264
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:37,634
Already thinking of defeat?

265
00:12:37,994 --> 00:12:40,075
Rundu needs
no cowardly commanders like you.

266
00:12:47,315 --> 00:12:48,474
Warriors fear not death

267
00:12:49,474 --> 00:12:50,994
but wield swords to protect our land

268
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:52,915
and our people.

269
00:13:01,474 --> 00:13:02,314
Soldiers!

270
00:13:02,634 --> 00:13:03,515
Both we and the Wutuo

271
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:04,795
lack supplies.

272
00:13:05,354 --> 00:13:06,714
This is a do-or-die battle.

273
00:13:07,195 --> 00:13:09,474
The brave will win.

274
00:13:10,114 --> 00:13:10,954
Besides,

275
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:14,515
General Fengyun's reinforcements
have arrived.

276
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,354
Director Chu of the Ministry of War

277
00:13:17,994 --> 00:13:19,195
has brought us provisions.

278
00:13:20,354 --> 00:13:23,395
Millions of Wei citizens
stand behind us.

279
00:13:24,195 --> 00:13:25,234
As warriors,

280
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:27,555
we raise swords to protect our land

281
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:28,714
and our people!

282
00:13:29,754 --> 00:13:30,594
Soldiers!

283
00:13:30,915 --> 00:13:32,075
Will you join me

284
00:13:32,714 --> 00:13:35,035
to fight the enemy outside, repel Wutuo,

285
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:36,634
and defend Rundu

286
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,435
and Wei?

287
00:13:38,874 --> 00:13:39,754
- Yes!
- Yes!

288
00:13:40,594 --> 00:13:41,434
General Fengyun

289
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:43,754
and General Wu'an stand with Rundu.

290
00:13:44,395 --> 00:13:45,235
This battle,

291
00:13:45,714 --> 00:13:46,754
we will win!

292
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:51,655
- Win!
- Win!

293
00:13:51,655 --> 00:13:55,795
- Win!
- Win!

294
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:25,834
The wind's here.

295
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:30,155
Smoke out!

296
00:14:33,384 --> 00:14:34,696
(Rundu City)

297
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:57,315
What?

298
00:14:57,315 --> 00:14:58,195
What's all this smoke?

299
00:14:58,275 --> 00:14:59,115
Yeah.

300
00:14:59,354 --> 00:15:00,194
Such dense smoke.

301
00:15:09,954 --> 00:15:11,035
Commander, please...

302
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:12,755
Hear that?

303
00:15:22,994 --> 00:15:23,834
Arrows approaching.

304
00:15:39,354 --> 00:15:40,515
A mere smokescreen.

305
00:15:41,035 --> 00:15:41,875
Nothing to fear.

306
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,115
Archers, ready.

307
00:16:27,075 --> 00:16:27,915
Charge!

308
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,194
Capture their leader first.

309
00:18:09,315 --> 00:18:10,515
(They fight with no retreat.)

310
00:18:11,035 --> 00:18:12,515
(So I'm their true target.)

311
00:18:13,914 --> 00:18:14,995
All troops, heed orders!

312
00:18:15,755 --> 00:18:16,715
Defend the headquarters!

313
00:18:17,634 --> 00:18:18,715
Let their blood

314
00:18:18,995 --> 00:18:20,194
consecrate our banners!

315
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,235
Defend the headquarters!

316
00:18:24,515 --> 00:18:25,355
Charge!

317
00:18:25,715 --> 00:18:26,995
- Charge!
- Charge!

318
00:19:05,914 --> 00:19:06,955
Sacrificing your own man.

319
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:08,075
How heartless.

320
00:19:08,555 --> 00:19:09,395
Dying for me

321
00:19:09,634 --> 00:19:10,555
is their noblest end.

322
00:19:57,874 --> 00:19:59,114
Comrades who stand together

323
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:00,995
make true commanders.

324
00:20:11,154 --> 00:20:11,994
Xiao Jue!

325
00:20:26,674 --> 00:20:27,515
Xiao Jue!

326
00:20:32,194 --> 00:20:34,674
Xiao Jue!

327
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:43,994
Xiao Jue.

328
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:45,835
Xiao Jue.

329
00:21:16,114 --> 00:21:17,354
Xiao Jue.

330
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:37,194
Xiao Jue!

331
00:21:57,434 --> 00:21:59,035
Xiao Jue.

Go to ask Yan He

350
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:18,395
for reinforcements.

351
00:24:19,114 --> 00:24:19,954
The journey's long.

352
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:20,915
Ride at full speed.

353
00:24:21,275 --> 00:24:22,115
Depart immediately.

354
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,034
Yes.

355
00:24:23,707 --> 00:24:25,059
(Yan)

356
00:24:26,755 --> 00:24:27,595
Xiao Huaijin.

357
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:46,315
The supplies have arrived.

358
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:47,914
Yingxiang and Ms. Qi Luo

359
00:24:48,194 --> 00:24:50,154
are making congee
with the rescued women.

360
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:51,995
Thanks to your foresight, Mr. Chu.

361
00:24:52,354 --> 00:24:53,755
Before coming, you had Yingxiang

362
00:24:53,795 --> 00:24:54,674
gather provisions.

363
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:57,555
I don't deserve such praise.

364
00:24:58,075 --> 00:24:59,275
My part was small.

365
00:24:59,755 --> 00:25:00,715
We brought in the grain

366
00:25:00,914 --> 00:25:01,914
after the battle ended.

367
00:25:02,755 --> 00:25:03,834
Thank you, Commander Xiao.

368
00:25:04,475 --> 00:25:05,434
You led reinforcements

369
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:06,955
and summoned General Yan He.

370
00:25:07,995 --> 00:25:08,874
It's my duty.

371
00:25:09,315 --> 00:25:10,594
No thanks needed, Mr. Chu.

372
00:25:10,914 --> 00:25:11,754
Everyone.

373
00:25:13,874 --> 00:25:14,955
Rundu survived this crisis

374
00:25:15,194 --> 00:25:16,434
through your assistance.

375
00:25:17,235 --> 00:25:18,955
On behalf of all in Rundu,

376
00:25:19,275 --> 00:25:20,115
let me say thank you.

377
00:25:23,394 --> 00:25:24,275
Don't mention it.

378
00:25:24,995 --> 00:25:25,835
Protecting civilians

379
00:25:26,075 --> 00:25:27,035
is our duty.

380
00:25:27,475 --> 00:25:28,354
Aiding each other

381
00:25:28,715 --> 00:25:29,555
is our obligation.

382
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:31,115
No thanks required.

383
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:32,954
Yeah.

384
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:33,915
Duty.

385
00:25:34,475 --> 00:25:35,315
Obligation.

386
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:36,834
But some people...

387
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:48,075
General Wu'an,

388
00:25:48,395 --> 00:25:49,235
you remind me

389
00:25:49,235 --> 00:25:50,235
of my friend.

390
00:25:54,114 --> 00:25:56,035
No, the person he used to be.

391
00:26:08,515 --> 00:26:09,355
Don't tell me

392
00:26:09,715 --> 00:26:11,955
he thinks you resemble He Rufei.

393
00:26:13,795 --> 00:26:14,874
What's wrong with him?

394
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:16,874
You're much better than He Rufei.

395
00:26:17,755 --> 00:26:18,595
How about

396
00:26:18,874 --> 00:26:19,715
you leave Xiao Jue

397
00:26:20,275 --> 00:26:21,434
and join my command?

398
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:30,555
Yan He.

399
00:26:30,955 --> 00:26:31,795
So eager

400
00:26:32,154 --> 00:26:33,394
to poach him?

401
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:35,914
Shouldn't you ask me first?

402
00:26:36,715 --> 00:26:37,555
Cold Xiao,

403
00:26:37,874 --> 00:26:38,834
why so stingy?

404
00:26:40,154 --> 00:26:40,994
Commander Xiao.

405
00:26:41,715 --> 00:26:42,555
Mr. He

406
00:26:42,795 --> 00:26:43,995
is now General Wu'an.

407
00:26:44,555 --> 00:26:45,434
Where he wants to go

408
00:26:46,955 --> 00:26:47,795
isn't your decision.

409
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:54,114
Of course it's not my decision.

410
00:26:58,715 --> 00:26:59,555
Where he goes,

411
00:27:00,434 --> 00:27:01,274
what he does,

412
00:27:02,394 --> 00:27:03,475
it's all his choice.

413
00:27:36,515 --> 00:27:37,355
Commander.

414
00:27:39,594 --> 00:27:40,434
Commander,

415
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:41,555
I was going to see you.

416
00:27:42,315 --> 00:27:43,354
Leaving Yezhou Garrison

417
00:27:43,475 --> 00:27:44,634
was my decision alone.

418
00:27:45,154 --> 00:27:46,275
Wang Ba and Huang Xiong

419
00:27:46,674 --> 00:27:47,715
were forced by me.

420
00:27:48,354 --> 00:27:49,594
Please don't punish them.

421
00:27:50,194 --> 00:27:51,035
All blame

422
00:27:51,555 --> 00:27:52,795
should fall on me alone.

423
00:27:54,475 --> 00:27:55,315
Is that all?

424
00:27:55,914 --> 00:27:56,754
Yes.

425
00:28:00,194 --> 00:28:01,034
Follow me.

426
00:28:35,795 --> 00:28:36,635
Commander.

427
00:28:37,434 --> 00:28:38,274
What's this about?

428
00:28:40,035 --> 00:28:41,154
Before resolving the matter,

429
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:43,475
you left a letter

430
00:28:44,275 --> 00:28:46,235
and a pouch and then disappeared.

431
00:28:47,235 --> 00:28:48,075
What's that about?

432
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:53,875
What?

433
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:55,354
You left something else?

434
00:28:57,114 --> 00:28:57,954
Nothing else.

435
00:28:59,634 --> 00:29:00,674
I left the letter

436
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:02,115
because

437
00:29:02,475 --> 00:29:03,874
I've earned the general title,

438
00:29:04,515 --> 00:29:05,634
but I'm still your soldier.

439
00:29:06,275 --> 00:29:07,194
I left without orders,

440
00:29:07,515 --> 00:29:08,594
and I must tell you why.

441
00:29:09,154 --> 00:29:10,475
As for this pouch,

442
00:29:12,674 --> 00:29:13,755
I took the Qinglang Sword

443
00:29:14,315 --> 00:29:15,354
without permission.

444
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:17,954
This pouch serves as my apology.

445
00:29:32,275 --> 00:29:33,115
He Yan,

446
00:29:33,674 --> 00:29:35,194
my judgment was clouded,

447
00:29:35,995 --> 00:29:37,394
and I couldn't move past it,

448
00:29:38,075 --> 00:29:38,915
so I mistakenly

449
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,874
equated you with that scheming wretch,

450
00:29:42,515 --> 00:29:43,434
He Rufei.

451
00:29:45,315 --> 00:29:46,235
I should've known it.

452
00:29:46,674 --> 00:29:48,954
You are just you.

453
00:29:49,634 --> 00:29:50,515
You've always been

454
00:29:51,275 --> 00:29:52,634
my tenacious classmate

455
00:29:53,674 --> 00:29:55,154
with unwavering integrity,

456
00:29:57,634 --> 00:29:59,114
the general who defended our borders

457
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,434
without hesitation
even in mortal danger.

458
00:30:05,515 --> 00:30:06,674
After returning from Peidu,

459
00:30:07,594 --> 00:30:08,674
I wanted to apologize

460
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,394
and clarify everything

461
00:30:13,154 --> 00:30:14,114
and then accompany you

462
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:16,075
to reinforce Rundu.

463
00:30:17,475 --> 00:30:18,315
But by then,

464
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:20,594
you had left Yezhou Garrison.

465
00:30:22,594 --> 00:30:23,434
I thought

466
00:30:25,235 --> 00:30:26,475
you must have gone to Rundu.

467
00:30:29,315 --> 00:30:30,354
While in Chonghuai,

468
00:30:31,514 --> 00:30:33,434
I considered confessing
everything to you.

469
00:30:34,434 --> 00:30:36,075
But while I was still hesitating,

470
00:30:36,594 --> 00:30:37,834
you uncovered it yourself.

471
00:30:39,594 --> 00:30:40,434
He Yan,

472
00:30:41,512 --> 00:30:43,715
no matter what storms lie ahead,

473
00:30:46,315 --> 00:30:47,394
I will always trust you

474
00:30:49,795 --> 00:30:50,755
and stand with you

475
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,555
to overcome hardship.

476
00:30:57,634 --> 00:30:58,474
Good.

477
00:31:00,634 --> 00:31:01,474
Long time no see,

478
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:03,434
Commander Xiao.

479
00:31:08,755 --> 00:31:09,595
It's been a while,

480
00:31:11,515 --> 00:31:12,355
General He.

481
00:31:26,114 --> 00:31:27,475
Miss... Miss He,

482
00:31:27,995 --> 00:31:29,394
my temper was terrible,

483
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:30,834
and I was hostile to you.

484
00:31:31,195 --> 00:31:33,434
The Commander had me
look into He Rufei in the capital.

485
00:31:33,994 --> 00:31:35,715
Then I realized I'd wronged you.

486
00:31:36,955 --> 00:31:37,795
Please forgive me.

487
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:39,674
It's understandable.

488
00:31:40,354 --> 00:31:41,194
I bear no grudge.

489
00:31:41,914 --> 00:31:42,754
Besides,

490
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:44,275
didn't the Commander

491
00:31:44,594 --> 00:31:46,715
give me the cold shoulder for days?

492
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,674
You're magnanimous, Miss He.

493
00:31:54,275 --> 00:31:55,115
Please forgive me.

494
00:31:58,154 --> 00:31:59,475
I'm generous,

495
00:32:00,075 --> 00:32:01,315
so you're forgiven.

496
00:32:07,434 --> 00:32:08,594
But as for some matters,

497
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:11,555
I can never overlook them.

498
00:32:13,394 --> 00:32:16,075
I must personally expose
He Rufei's hypocrisy

499
00:32:16,776 --> 00:32:18,154
and ensure both he and Xu Jingfu

500
00:32:18,555 --> 00:32:19,874
face proper justice.

501
00:32:20,515 --> 00:32:21,634
Following your orders,

502
00:32:22,154 --> 00:32:24,034
I investigated the Huayuan Battle.

503
00:32:24,034 --> 00:32:26,235
The seven generals
initially divided into

504
00:32:26,515 --> 00:32:27,555
three groups as planned

505
00:32:28,035 --> 00:32:30,154
to support He Rufei who was
against Wutuo's main army.

506
00:32:30,794 --> 00:32:31,634
But en route,

507
00:32:31,634 --> 00:32:32,995
they all fell into Wutuo ambushes.

508
00:32:33,475 --> 00:32:34,475
All seven perished.

509
00:32:34,914 --> 00:32:36,275
Then He Rufei avenged them

510
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:38,075
by crushing the Wutuo forces

511
00:32:38,434 --> 00:32:39,674
and driving them from Huayuan.

512
00:32:39,674 --> 00:32:40,874
This reeks of deception.

513
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:43,874
Three separate groups

514
00:32:44,154 --> 00:32:45,795
were all ambushed?

515
00:32:46,035 --> 00:32:47,154
No survivors?

516
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:49,874
He Rufei alone

517
00:32:50,194 --> 00:32:51,235
emerged victorious,

518
00:32:51,674 --> 00:32:52,514
repelling

519
00:32:52,515 --> 00:32:53,914
the formidable Wutuo army?

520
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:56,475
He Rufei

521
00:32:56,834 --> 00:32:59,315
schemed to conceal his true identity.

522
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:01,035
He teamed up with Wutuo again

523
00:33:01,434 --> 00:33:02,354
and set the ambush

524
00:33:02,874 --> 00:33:03,914
to kill them indirectly.

525
00:33:04,434 --> 00:33:06,035
Suspecting your survival,

526
00:33:06,914 --> 00:33:08,594
he first used the Wutuo forces to kill

527
00:33:09,235 --> 00:33:10,475
the Seven Tiger Generals.

528
00:33:11,075 --> 00:33:12,594
Then he dangled Li Kuang of Rundu

529
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:13,875
as bait for you.

530
00:33:14,555 --> 00:33:15,795
If you rescued Li Kuang,

531
00:33:16,515 --> 00:33:17,755
you'd walk into his trap.

532
00:33:18,434 --> 00:33:19,795
He'd repeat his old tactics,

533
00:33:19,795 --> 00:33:22,275
using Wutuo to eliminate you.

534
00:33:23,515 --> 00:33:24,515
Before coming to Rundu,

535
00:33:25,115 --> 00:33:27,475
I knew this was his scheme.

536
00:33:28,435 --> 00:33:30,895
But whether for my past comrade

537
00:33:30,895 --> 00:33:32,755
or the people of Rundu,

538
00:33:33,315 --> 00:33:34,315
I had to come.

539
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:37,995
He Rufei prides himself

540
00:33:38,555 --> 00:33:40,354
on manipulating people's minds.

541
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,595
But he never anticipated

542
00:33:44,755 --> 00:33:47,154
that you would risk being charged again

543
00:33:47,874 --> 00:33:49,154
to reinforce Rundu.

544
00:33:53,154 --> 00:33:53,994
By the way,

545
00:33:54,194 --> 00:33:55,434
could you ask Li Kuang

546
00:33:55,594 --> 00:33:57,834
to draft a reinforcement request
for you and Yan He

547
00:33:58,475 --> 00:34:00,275
to prevent those with ulterior motives

548
00:34:01,275 --> 00:34:02,394
from twisting the situation?

549
00:34:05,154 --> 00:34:06,674
By wearing that mask this time,

550
00:34:07,674 --> 00:34:09,674
you've terrified the Wutuo forces.

551
00:34:10,395 --> 00:34:11,915
He Rufei will certainly use this

552
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:13,355
to confirm your identity.

553
00:34:16,234 --> 00:34:17,395
Since I've come to Rundu,

554
00:34:17,794 --> 00:34:18,995
I'm not afraid of him knowing.

555
00:34:20,274 --> 00:34:21,114
When I return,

556
00:34:22,075 --> 00:34:24,634
I'll stand before him
with my head held high.

557
00:34:25,754 --> 00:34:26,875
I'll make sure he learns

558
00:34:29,114 --> 00:34:31,955
who the real General Feihong is.

559
00:34:35,355 --> 00:34:36,314
Speaking of which,

560
00:34:37,515 --> 00:34:39,035
since He Rufei and Xu Jingfu

561
00:34:39,274 --> 00:34:40,594
have been colluding for so long,

562
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:41,835
there must be evidence

563
00:34:42,234 --> 00:34:43,515
of their collaboration.

564
00:34:44,075 --> 00:34:44,955
And that evidence

565
00:34:45,435 --> 00:34:46,314
is in the capital.

566
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:48,194
So I want to return sooner

567
00:34:48,435 --> 00:34:50,314
to investigate potential leads.

568
00:34:51,475 --> 00:34:53,515
Good. I'll go with you.
