=Episode 19=

23
00:01:52,348 --> 00:01:52,907
Good morning.

24
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:53,667
Commander Xiao.

25
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:54,588
Miss He.

26
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,148
Let's have breakfast together.

27
00:01:58,027 --> 00:01:58,664
Please.

28
00:02:02,988 --> 00:02:03,827
Actually,

29
00:02:03,948 --> 00:02:04,948
I've known for a while

30
00:02:05,068 --> 00:02:06,667
you're not my elder brother's son.

31
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:12,028
Your act

32
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:13,147
was quite convincing.

33
00:02:13,628 --> 00:02:14,667
Since Her Highness knew

34
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:15,867
you came to Jiyang

35
00:02:15,908 --> 00:02:17,028
and yet did nothing,

36
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:18,267
she must have her plans.

37
00:02:18,468 --> 00:02:19,387
In that case,

38
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:21,508
I had to play the fool.

39
00:02:23,387 --> 00:02:25,028
You're a master of disguise.

40
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:25,948
I'm impressed.

41
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,188
To become Princess Mengji's right hand,

42
00:02:28,707 --> 00:02:29,308
you must be

43
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:31,147
exceptionally clever.

44
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:34,267
Not as astute as you.

45
00:02:35,987 --> 00:02:37,308
Let's have breakfast together.

46
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,416
Please.

47
00:02:50,908 --> 00:02:51,387
Mr. Chu.

48
00:02:54,028 --> 00:02:54,987
Mr. He, good morning.

49
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:55,827
Good morning.

50
00:02:56,827 --> 00:02:58,908
But now I should call you Miss He.

51
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,628
You're still mistaken.

52
00:03:02,387 --> 00:03:03,028
Currently,

53
00:03:04,028 --> 00:03:05,308
you should call her Mrs. Qiao.

54
00:03:11,308 --> 00:03:12,628
We have a visit to make, right?

55
00:03:12,987 --> 00:03:13,547
Let's go.

56
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:15,147
Go.

57
00:03:15,908 --> 00:03:16,707
Don't miss the time.

58
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,480
Mr. Chu.

59
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:22,468
I'll take my leave.

60
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:50,228
Speak your mind.

61
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:53,827
How did you know

62
00:03:54,228 --> 00:03:55,628
I was visiting an elder?

63
00:03:56,468 --> 00:03:58,068
You dressed formally this morning,

64
00:03:58,748 --> 00:04:00,147
obviously to meet someone.

65
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:01,547
In all of Jiyang,

66
00:04:02,147 --> 00:04:03,748
the only one worthy of such formality

67
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:05,228
would be your master.

68
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:07,308
My master once told me

69
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:08,587
that if needed,

70
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,948
I could find him in Jiyang.

71
00:04:10,628 --> 00:04:11,427
I assumed

72
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:12,788
he was merely enjoying nature

73
00:04:13,028 --> 00:04:13,788
but never imagined

74
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:15,348
there was a hidden story.

75
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:21,988
What story?

76
00:04:22,988 --> 00:04:24,267
If it's hidden,

77
00:04:24,587 --> 00:04:25,907
it can't be revealed.

78
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:27,267
Commander,

79
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:29,108
please don't press me.

80
00:04:30,707 --> 00:04:31,068
Fine.

81
00:04:31,868 --> 00:04:32,868
I don't care to know.

82
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:34,948
Thank you.

83
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:50,088
Thank you.

84
00:04:51,868 --> 00:04:52,668
Thank you, Master.

85
00:04:54,188 --> 00:04:54,948
Master Yunlin.

86
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:57,068
When did you arrive here?

87
00:05:01,147 --> 00:05:02,587
Around each Water God Festival,

88
00:05:02,988 --> 00:05:04,787
I return to Jiyang City.

89
00:05:05,428 --> 00:05:06,267
This time,

90
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:08,027
I discovered Wutuo spies

91
00:05:08,428 --> 00:05:10,027
disguised as civilians.

92
00:05:10,508 --> 00:05:11,147
So,

93
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:12,587
I tracked them secretly

94
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:13,868
and indeed,

95
00:05:14,508 --> 00:05:15,467
these Wutuo spies

96
00:05:15,988 --> 00:05:17,948
used the festival crowds

97
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:19,668
to kidnap the young princess

98
00:05:19,948 --> 00:05:21,508
to blackmail Princess Mengji.

99
00:05:22,508 --> 00:05:23,628
The kidnapping

100
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:25,467
is just the first step.

101
00:05:26,628 --> 00:05:27,428
Now, Wutuo agents

102
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:28,988
move freely through Jiyang,

103
00:05:29,827 --> 00:05:31,068
like water eroding stone.

104
00:05:31,387 --> 00:05:32,467
This was long planned.

105
00:05:33,188 --> 00:05:33,868
Her Highness

106
00:05:34,027 --> 00:05:34,748
dislikes

107
00:05:34,827 --> 00:05:35,707
our interference

108
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:37,227
but has enhanced

109
00:05:37,227 --> 00:05:38,227
security checks.

110
00:05:38,787 --> 00:05:40,108
Let's hope it helps.

111
00:05:41,188 --> 00:05:43,587
It feels like a storm
is brewing in Jiyang City.

112
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:45,548
Something major approaches.

113
00:05:50,628 --> 00:05:51,272
You continue.

114
00:05:51,827 --> 00:05:53,428
I need fresh air.

115
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:01,628
Ask what you wish.

116
00:06:05,587 --> 00:06:06,308
Master.

117
00:06:06,827 --> 00:06:08,467
Did you stay in Jiyang

118
00:06:08,548 --> 00:06:09,628
for Princess Mengji?

119
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:12,748
Or is there another reason?

120
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:14,907
Even if she weren't Princess Mengji,

121
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:17,508
I won't stand idly by

122
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:18,587
and see the people

123
00:06:18,988 --> 00:06:20,508
in Jiyang suffer.

124
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:22,467
Isn't it the same between you

125
00:06:22,707 --> 00:06:23,668
and General Fengyun?

126
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,668
You're right.

127
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,147
I was small-minded.

128
00:06:31,868 --> 00:06:32,827
But Master,

129
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:34,188
you...

130
00:06:34,988 --> 00:06:36,548
Do you truly have no wish to see

131
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:38,147
Princess Mengji again?

132
00:06:41,707 --> 00:06:43,147
You have much work to attend to.

133
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:44,628
I won't keep you longer.

134
00:06:58,108 --> 00:06:58,827
Your master

135
00:06:59,387 --> 00:07:00,668
seems burdened.

136
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:02,467
Even you noticed.

137
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:25,508
I don't know

138
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:26,628
Master Yunlin well,

139
00:07:27,628 --> 00:07:28,168
but

140
00:07:29,387 --> 00:07:31,628
this melody clearly reveals deep sorrow.

141
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:36,707
You truly are a master of music.

142
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,548
People may conceal truths,

143
00:07:40,748 --> 00:07:42,988
but instruments never lie.

144
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:49,347
If I recall correctly,

145
00:07:49,988 --> 00:07:51,108
Princess Mengji also played

146
00:07:51,108 --> 00:07:52,027
this melody before?

147
00:07:56,548 --> 00:07:58,108
They truly share a profound connection.

148
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:09,064
(Peaceful Land)

149
00:08:18,787 --> 00:08:19,368
Commander,

150
00:08:20,027 --> 00:08:20,948
Mr. Cui needs you

151
00:08:21,227 --> 00:08:22,068
for urgent matters.

152
00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:24,948
I'll take my leave.

153
00:08:25,347 --> 00:08:25,928
And you?

154
00:08:26,027 --> 00:08:26,907
You should return.

155
00:08:27,188 --> 00:08:28,147
I'll walk around

156
00:08:28,387 --> 00:08:29,188
and secretly inspect

157
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:30,068
the defenses.

158
00:08:36,091 --> 00:08:37,347
(South Gate)

159
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:38,057
Next.

160
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,568
Go.

161
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:43,720
Next.

162
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:47,388
Next.

163
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,388
Next.

164
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:54,280
Go.

165
00:08:57,587 --> 00:08:58,280
Go.

166
00:09:00,347 --> 00:09:00,968
Go.

167
00:09:01,827 --> 00:09:03,587
Princess Mengji is decisive.

168
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:04,827
A masterful defender.

169
00:09:07,587 --> 00:09:08,136
Next.

170
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:17,068
I truly hope Jiyang City

171
00:09:17,388 --> 00:09:18,788
can maintain this peace

172
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:19,827
and harmony forever.

173
00:09:49,627 --> 00:09:50,227
Mr. Chu?

174
00:09:50,428 --> 00:09:51,188
Why is it you?

175
00:09:52,788 --> 00:09:53,467
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:54,148 --> 00:09:54,827
I startled you?

177
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,008
It's nothing.

178
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:57,467
These are turbulent times.

179
00:09:57,668 --> 00:09:58,908
Caution is only natural.

180
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:00,227
Please don't take offense.

181
00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:02,428
Actually,

182
00:10:02,827 --> 00:10:03,948
I want to apologize to you.

183
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:05,347
Apologize?

184
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:06,747
Why?

185
00:10:07,428 --> 00:10:09,747
Last time, it was I who invited you

186
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:11,308
to admire the moon over Mount Baiyue.

187
00:10:11,747 --> 00:10:12,788
But urgent matters arose,

188
00:10:13,148 --> 00:10:13,747
and I left.

189
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,028
Nothing.

190
00:10:16,188 --> 00:10:17,308
Don't take it seriously.

191
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,148
Moreover,

192
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:21,188
I did gain something else that night.

193
00:10:26,068 --> 00:10:26,948
You hold no grudge

194
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:28,428
due to your magnanimity.

195
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:29,987
I cannot pretend

196
00:10:30,028 --> 00:10:30,788
it never happened.

197
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:32,707
I must apologize.

198
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,056
By the way,

199
00:10:34,908 --> 00:10:36,268
let me give you a gift, Miss He.

200
00:10:36,827 --> 00:10:37,480
What?

201
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:40,188
Last time we met,

202
00:10:40,747 --> 00:10:41,627
I noticed

203
00:10:41,788 --> 00:10:42,827
you wore a purple whip

204
00:10:42,867 --> 00:10:43,707
at your waist.

205
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:44,987
By chance,

206
00:10:45,068 --> 00:10:45,987
I obtained this tassel.

207
00:10:46,948 --> 00:10:48,467
I think it suits you perfectly.

208
00:10:48,908 --> 00:10:49,548
Try it on.

209
00:10:49,747 --> 00:10:50,867
See if it's better.

210
00:10:54,507 --> 00:10:55,068
Mr. Chu,

211
00:10:55,548 --> 00:10:56,388
I can't accept it.

212
00:10:56,627 --> 00:10:57,347
Forget it.

213
00:10:57,788 --> 00:10:58,467
Besides,

214
00:10:58,668 --> 00:10:59,747
this tassel appears

215
00:10:59,908 --> 00:11:00,827
quite valuable.

216
00:11:02,148 --> 00:11:03,107
You call me Mr. Chu.

217
00:11:03,268 --> 00:11:04,268
We're friends.

218
00:11:04,428 --> 00:11:05,107
Between friends,

219
00:11:05,227 --> 00:11:06,507
exchanging gifts is natural.

220
00:11:06,587 --> 00:11:07,268
Besides,

221
00:11:07,747 --> 00:11:08,908
this tassel isn't costly,

222
00:11:09,107 --> 00:11:10,227
so feel no obligation.

223
00:11:12,424 --> 00:11:13,028
Okay.

224
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:13,788
I'll accept it.

225
00:11:14,587 --> 00:11:16,107
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

226
00:11:26,188 --> 00:11:26,908
Perfect match.

227
00:11:29,308 --> 00:11:30,188
In return,

228
00:11:30,587 --> 00:11:32,107
I should give you something, Mr. Chu.

229
00:11:38,987 --> 00:11:40,028
- Sir.
- Miss.

230
00:11:40,028 --> 00:11:41,388
Which is the priciest one

231
00:11:41,388 --> 00:11:41,908
here?

232
00:11:41,987 --> 00:11:42,788
The floral basket.

233
00:11:42,987 --> 00:11:43,948
Would you like one?

234
00:11:44,188 --> 00:11:45,068
Yes, give me one.

235
00:11:45,107 --> 00:11:45,707
Alright.

236
00:11:47,347 --> 00:11:48,308
May I draw it myself?

237
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:49,347
Certainly.

238
00:11:49,587 --> 00:11:50,148
Here you go.

239
00:12:48,627 --> 00:12:49,668
Done.

240
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:50,548
How's this?

241
00:12:50,827 --> 00:12:51,668
Do you like it?

242
00:12:56,627 --> 00:12:57,268
Zilan

243
00:12:57,347 --> 00:12:58,507
means fragrant orchid.

244
00:12:58,827 --> 00:12:59,948
The person who named you

245
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:00,908
loved you certainly.

246
00:13:01,268 --> 00:13:03,467
They surely wished you noble virtues

247
00:13:03,587 --> 00:13:04,388
and a good future,

248
00:13:04,668 --> 00:13:05,908
so you got this elegant name.

249
00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:06,824
This is

250
00:13:07,028 --> 00:13:08,028
my reciprocal gift.

251
00:13:08,308 --> 00:13:08,908
Mr. Chu,

252
00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:10,428
don't mock my clumsy handwriting.

253
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:12,668
How could I?

254
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:13,707
I'm deeply honored.

255
00:13:16,548 --> 00:13:17,107
Burn him!

256
00:13:17,227 --> 00:13:18,388
- Burn him!
- Burn him!

257
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:28,827
Mr. Chu.

258
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:31,467
Mr. Chu.

259
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:33,668
It's okay.

260
00:13:34,428 --> 00:13:35,107
Are you

261
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:36,908
afraid of fire?

262
00:13:42,507 --> 00:13:43,268
Thank goodness

263
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:44,587
this isn't ruined.

264
00:13:52,476 --> 00:13:55,272
(Mengji Mansion)

265
00:13:58,428 --> 00:13:59,467
Jiyang's defenses

266
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:00,747
remain well-fortified.

267
00:14:02,587 --> 00:14:03,507
Let's hope so.

268
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:07,987
Commander.

269
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:15,432
Commander.

270
00:14:15,627 --> 00:14:16,587
Where are you going?

271
00:14:17,707 --> 00:14:18,308
Just walking.

272
00:14:19,148 --> 00:14:19,987
Then I'll join you.

273
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:27,188
This is a gift from Mr. Chu.

274
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:31,908
Miss He also gave me a gift.

275
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:33,908
I like it very much.

276
00:14:41,107 --> 00:14:42,707
She once sent me osmanthus candies,

277
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,347
a whole handful,

278
00:14:46,188 --> 00:14:47,188
more than I could eat.

279
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:52,467
The characters "Zilan"
on this sugar painting

280
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:55,148
were written by Miss He herself.

281
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:01,467
This food is fragile.

282
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,788
You should keep it carefully

283
00:15:04,428 --> 00:15:05,028
in case you

284
00:15:05,668 --> 00:15:06,867
end up with nothing.

285
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:10,068
Thank you for the advice.

286
00:15:10,347 --> 00:15:11,867
I'll preserve it with utmost care.

287
00:15:17,428 --> 00:15:19,068
If you both enjoy sweets so much,

288
00:15:19,428 --> 00:15:20,747
I'll buy more in the future.

289
00:15:21,548 --> 00:15:22,152
Commander.

290
00:15:25,908 --> 00:15:26,987
Several crucial granaries

291
00:15:27,028 --> 00:15:27,668
are ablaze.

292
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:28,788
Very fiercely.

293
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:30,107
It's the Wutuo's doing.

294
00:15:31,467 --> 00:15:32,268
Assist Mr. Cui

295
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:32,987
in it.

296
00:15:33,827 --> 00:15:34,440
Yes.

297
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:37,388
Let's discuss it

298
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:38,507
with Princess Mengji.

299
00:15:39,428 --> 00:15:39,976
Agreed.

300
00:15:49,188 --> 00:15:51,908
Fire! The granary's on fire!

301
00:15:56,308 --> 00:15:57,308
It's the Wutuo people.

302
00:15:58,548 --> 00:15:59,747
They've made their move.

303
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:12,587
Quite the spectacle.

304
00:16:13,227 --> 00:16:14,308
Those Wutuo people

305
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:15,908
grow more audacious by the day.

306
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:17,867
Doesn't this situation feel

307
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:18,788
all too familiar?

308
00:16:19,908 --> 00:16:20,507
Mingshui

309
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:21,587
and Que City

310
00:16:21,788 --> 00:16:23,068
both witnessed similar things.

311
00:16:24,028 --> 00:16:24,707
The Wutuo people

312
00:16:24,827 --> 00:16:26,148
breached the defenses easily

313
00:16:26,347 --> 00:16:27,268
and launched attacks.

314
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:29,747
This time, Chancellor Xu aided them.

315
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,188
As for the previous two...

316
00:16:35,908 --> 00:16:37,107
After this,

317
00:16:37,428 --> 00:16:39,068
Xiao Jue won't let this slide.

318
00:16:39,428 --> 00:16:40,188
Go take a look.

319
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:25,828
Skip the formalities.

320
00:17:26,348 --> 00:17:27,148
You've come.

321
00:17:27,908 --> 00:17:28,467
Lou,

322
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:30,307
they're your life savers.

323
00:17:30,707 --> 00:17:31,467
Have you forgotten

324
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,267
your manners?

325
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:33,628
How could you act like this?

326
00:17:36,908 --> 00:17:37,547
Commander Xiao.

327
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:39,267
I was just about to see you.

328
00:17:39,908 --> 00:17:40,628
As you observed,

329
00:17:41,307 --> 00:17:42,628
Wutuo is watching hungrily.

330
00:17:43,027 --> 00:17:44,348
The situation in Jiyang City

331
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:46,588
grows more dire by the day.

332
00:17:47,188 --> 00:17:48,628
Though I've dispatched troops

333
00:17:48,747 --> 00:17:50,027
and increased security,

334
00:17:50,307 --> 00:17:51,188
the Wutuo people

335
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:52,628
are moving faster.

336
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:53,868
How many men

337
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:55,348
are stationed here?

338
00:17:56,547 --> 00:17:57,227
Under 20,000.

339
00:17:59,668 --> 00:18:00,348
We've captured

340
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:01,828
some Wutuo infiltrators,

341
00:18:02,507 --> 00:18:04,067
but it won't turn the tide.

342
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:06,787
Wutuo has already launched its attack.

343
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:08,787
This will be a bitter struggle.

344
00:18:10,227 --> 00:18:11,948
Though Jiyang lacks manpower,

345
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:13,307
we'll never retreat.

346
00:18:13,948 --> 00:18:15,188
I'll hold my position here

347
00:18:15,987 --> 00:18:16,948
and stand with Jiyang

348
00:18:17,707 --> 00:18:18,628
to the last breath.

349
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,027
I'd like

350
00:18:22,948 --> 00:18:24,428
to offer my assistance.

351
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:41,787
Leaving your post at Yezhou

352
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:43,227
is a breach of military law.

353
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:44,787
Commanding troops now

354
00:18:45,388 --> 00:18:46,067
would bring

355
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:47,908
graver consequences.

356
00:18:48,948 --> 00:18:49,707
Do you truly

357
00:18:50,148 --> 00:18:51,108
risk such repercussions

358
00:18:51,787 --> 00:18:53,307
for Jiyang's sake?

359
00:18:54,388 --> 00:18:55,588
As a Wei general,

360
00:18:56,188 --> 00:18:56,987
it's my duty

361
00:18:57,868 --> 00:18:58,787
to protect the people.

362
00:19:03,908 --> 00:19:06,108
I'll contribute my efforts, too.

363
00:19:08,707 --> 00:19:09,288
Good.

364
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:11,027
From this moment,

365
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:12,987
all Jiyang troops

366
00:19:13,388 --> 00:19:14,787
will obey Commander Xiao's orders.

367
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:22,908
Our people's safety

368
00:19:23,588 --> 00:19:24,908
rests in your hands, Commander.

369
00:19:27,227 --> 00:19:28,388
I'll spare no effort

370
00:19:28,948 --> 00:19:30,227
to defend Jiyang to the last.

371
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:43,432
Your Highness,

372
00:19:44,108 --> 00:19:45,628
the war looms imminent.

373
00:19:46,148 --> 00:19:46,787
Perhaps

374
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:47,828
the young princess

375
00:19:48,027 --> 00:19:49,108
should be sent away.

376
00:19:50,027 --> 00:19:51,027
I'm staying here.

377
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:52,467
I remain with Mother

378
00:19:52,908 --> 00:19:54,348
and our people

379
00:19:54,388 --> 00:19:55,227
no matter what.

380
00:20:05,027 --> 00:20:05,547
So be it.

381
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:07,747
You'll stay by my side, Lou.

382
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:09,948
I'll keep you safe,

383
00:20:10,307 --> 00:20:11,348
whatever the cost.

384
00:20:30,267 --> 00:20:35,908
(Self-Revealing Virtue)

385
00:20:35,908 --> 00:20:37,108
The troops here in Jiyang

386
00:20:37,668 --> 00:20:38,547
are far too few.

387
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:41,148
And they lack recent combat experience.

388
00:20:43,787 --> 00:20:45,428
You show true leadership.

389
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:46,507
Unflinching in crisis.

390
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:48,868
Aren't you

391
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,828
aspiring to be a female general?

392
00:20:52,388 --> 00:20:52,987
20,000 men.

393
00:20:53,547 --> 00:20:54,388
Far better than that

394
00:20:54,507 --> 00:20:55,188
in Que City.

395
00:20:56,307 --> 00:20:57,267
Whether 20,000

396
00:20:57,388 --> 00:20:58,227
or 2,000,

397
00:20:58,828 --> 00:20:59,868
when enemies are outside,

398
00:21:00,348 --> 00:21:01,628
we fight to the death.

399
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:03,668
Prove those words true.

400
00:21:08,987 --> 00:21:09,747
These 20,000 men

401
00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:11,787
will follow your command.

402
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:15,267
Wise choice, Commander.

403
00:21:16,027 --> 00:21:17,108
None could lead but me.

404
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:23,336
Thrust.

405
00:21:24,148 --> 00:21:24,808
Stab.

406
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:28,456
Down. Chop.

407
00:21:28,948 --> 00:21:30,267
After years without combat,

408
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:31,707
they look slack.

409
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:33,987
Such bold claims.

410
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:35,987
You make our army

411
00:21:35,987 --> 00:21:37,188
sound like brittle clay.

412
00:21:37,668 --> 00:21:39,067
Just a mere woman.

413
00:21:39,227 --> 00:21:40,467
How can you teach us men

414
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,428
battle tactics?

415
00:21:41,987 --> 00:21:43,547
You're gambling

416
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:44,227
with our lives.

417
00:21:46,108 --> 00:21:46,728
Well?

418
00:21:46,948 --> 00:21:48,108
Care to test me?

419
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:49,707
Don't waste time.

420
00:21:51,027 --> 00:21:51,787
All ten of you

421
00:21:54,428 --> 00:21:55,747
attack her at once.

422
00:21:56,628 --> 00:21:58,307
You mock us?

423
00:21:58,828 --> 00:21:59,828
I would like to see

424
00:21:59,908 --> 00:22:01,547
how you'll face ten opponents alone.

425
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:02,888
Commander.

426
00:22:03,547 --> 00:22:05,227
You honor me excessively.

427
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,787
Do you know?

428
00:22:10,908 --> 00:22:11,948
I hear

429
00:22:12,188 --> 00:22:14,588
Mrs. Qiao is challenging
the Jiyang army single-handedly

430
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:17,027
at the training field.

431
00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:19,868
Is she crazy?

432
00:22:32,828 --> 00:22:33,868
Any more challengers?

433
00:22:34,027 --> 00:22:35,628
- Great!
- Great!

434
00:22:36,787 --> 00:22:37,747
- Great!
- Great!

435
00:22:37,828 --> 00:22:38,388
Now you see

436
00:22:38,388 --> 00:22:39,307
how formidable she is.

437
00:22:39,828 --> 00:22:41,307
Truly the best of Yezhou Garrison.

438
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:43,267
This scene

439
00:22:43,467 --> 00:22:44,987
looks eerily familiar to me.

440
00:22:51,144 --> 00:22:51,720
Here.

441
00:22:54,787 --> 00:22:55,400
Thank you.

442
00:22:56,948 --> 00:22:58,267
- Amazing!
- Awesome!

443
00:22:58,588 --> 00:22:59,227
Yes.

444
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:03,227
Incredible!

445
00:23:04,547 --> 00:23:05,828
Didn't I tell you the truth?

446
00:23:06,467 --> 00:23:07,067
Women

447
00:23:07,828 --> 00:23:09,108
are never inferior to men.

448
00:23:09,828 --> 00:23:10,588
Through the ages,

449
00:23:11,027 --> 00:23:11,828
people have claimed

450
00:23:12,428 --> 00:23:14,067
women belong at embroidery frames

451
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:15,148
and housewifery.

452
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:16,467
But must we women

453
00:23:17,067 --> 00:23:18,348
be confined to domestic roles

454
00:23:18,668 --> 00:23:19,707
or limited to needlework?

455
00:23:20,628 --> 00:23:22,027
We can write and fight.

456
00:23:22,507 --> 00:23:23,908
We can write literary masterpieces.

457
00:23:24,467 --> 00:23:25,747
We can charge into battle

458
00:23:26,148 --> 00:23:26,987
and earn glory.

459
00:23:27,828 --> 00:23:29,388
We're not just waiting to be saved.

460
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,307
We can save ourselves.

461
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:35,067
Of course

462
00:23:36,108 --> 00:23:37,307
I won't force you

463
00:23:37,828 --> 00:23:39,267
to fight on battlefields.

464
00:23:40,307 --> 00:23:41,868
But beyond combat,

465
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:43,428
you can do other things.

466
00:23:44,668 --> 00:23:45,588
Even the tiniest dust

467
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:47,267
can fill mountains and seas.

468
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:49,027
The faintest glow

469
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:50,747
can rival the sun and moon.

470
00:23:52,388 --> 00:23:53,707
I prided myself on noble birth

471
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:55,987
but remained trapped in stagnation.

472
00:23:56,707 --> 00:23:58,828
I can sell unwanted jewels

473
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:00,388
to buy

474
00:24:00,588 --> 00:24:01,948
weapons and provisions.

475
00:24:02,148 --> 00:24:05,668
- Me too!
- Me too!

476
00:24:05,787 --> 00:24:06,408
I'll donate.

477
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:09,707
Those who are poor can learn

478
00:24:09,707 --> 00:24:10,507
medicine from us.

479
00:24:10,828 --> 00:24:12,227
Countless soldiers will need care

480
00:24:12,227 --> 00:24:12,908
later.

481
00:24:13,507 --> 00:24:14,668
Rich or poor, all can learn.

482
00:24:21,588 --> 00:24:22,152
Well?

483
00:24:22,707 --> 00:24:23,388
Am I impressive?

484
00:24:24,227 --> 00:24:25,108
You know why I let you

485
00:24:25,108 --> 00:24:25,908
lead them?

486
00:24:26,307 --> 00:24:26,828
Because

487
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:29,588
I'm unquestionably capable.

488
00:24:34,948 --> 00:24:36,267
Miss He is so skilled

489
00:24:36,307 --> 00:24:37,108
in martial arts.

490
00:24:37,948 --> 00:24:38,467
She

491
00:24:39,108 --> 00:24:40,307
always defies convention.

492
00:24:43,828 --> 00:24:44,348
Young Master,

493
00:24:44,868 --> 00:24:45,908
Princess Mengji began

494
00:24:45,908 --> 00:24:47,588
evacuating the civilians today.

495
00:24:48,428 --> 00:24:49,628
Shouldn't you join them?

496
00:24:50,227 --> 00:24:51,307
My goal is unfinished.

497
00:24:51,868 --> 00:24:52,787
How can I leave now?

498
00:24:52,987 --> 00:24:54,307
But Jiyang is too dangerous.

499
00:24:54,987 --> 00:24:55,828
Only by staying

500
00:24:56,507 --> 00:24:57,227
can I uncover

501
00:24:57,388 --> 00:24:58,388
Master's true intentions.

502
00:24:59,388 --> 00:24:59,908
Yingxiang,

503
00:25:00,828 --> 00:25:01,868
two paths lie before me.

504
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:02,828
Either

505
00:25:04,188 --> 00:25:05,067
die in this city

506
00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:07,027
or survive

507
00:25:07,227 --> 00:25:08,668
to confirm my suspicions.

508
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:10,868
A life of complacency

509
00:25:10,987 --> 00:25:11,948
would be meaningless

510
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:13,108
even if I return.

511
00:25:13,787 --> 00:25:14,408
Understand?

512
00:25:26,987 --> 00:25:27,507
Keep up.

513
00:25:28,948 --> 00:25:30,027
Everyone, follow me.

514
00:25:30,108 --> 00:25:30,760
Stay close.

515
00:25:37,027 --> 00:25:37,868
Jiyang has become

516
00:25:38,027 --> 00:25:39,108
half-deserted overnight.

517
00:25:40,188 --> 00:25:41,467
Shops stand shuttered.

518
00:25:43,987 --> 00:25:44,908
Only the able-bodied

519
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:46,188
and those strong enough

520
00:25:46,388 --> 00:25:47,428
could flee.

521
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,787
The old, weak, and ill

522
00:25:50,628 --> 00:25:52,428
can't even join the exodus.

523
00:25:53,828 --> 00:25:54,467
Miss Song.

524
00:25:54,948 --> 00:25:55,948
I know what you'll say.

525
00:25:56,507 --> 00:25:57,388
Save your breath.

526
00:25:58,307 --> 00:25:59,227
As a healer,

527
00:25:59,787 --> 00:26:00,908
I won't abandon people

528
00:26:00,908 --> 00:26:01,547
in crisis.

529
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:04,507
What are you thinking?

530
00:26:05,227 --> 00:26:06,388
Don't you want me to leave?

531
00:26:07,388 --> 00:26:08,227
Come on!

532
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:10,108
You haven't conceded defeat yet.

533
00:26:10,668 --> 00:26:11,707
And you want to escape?

534
00:26:12,108 --> 00:26:12,747
Cheng Lisu.

535
00:26:12,747 --> 00:26:13,547
Besides,

536
00:26:14,188 --> 00:26:15,388
you aim to heal the world

537
00:26:16,027 --> 00:26:17,348
and reform medical texts.

538
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,227
No one should obstruct your path.

539
00:26:22,348 --> 00:26:23,428
Cheng Lisu.

540
00:26:24,747 --> 00:26:25,307
This time,

541
00:26:25,707 --> 00:26:26,828
let's see who saves more.

542
00:26:27,348 --> 00:26:28,588
It's also part of the contest.

543
00:26:29,267 --> 00:26:30,388
If you lose,

544
00:26:30,787 --> 00:26:31,628
you'll have to wash

545
00:26:31,668 --> 00:26:32,547
my socks for a year.

546
00:26:33,868 --> 00:26:34,987
You're destined to lose.

547
00:26:35,547 --> 00:26:36,267
There won't be

548
00:26:36,467 --> 00:26:37,588
many women for you to rescue

549
00:26:37,707 --> 00:26:38,267
in combat.

550
00:26:39,267 --> 00:26:40,348
I won't lose.

551
00:26:42,148 --> 00:26:43,348
Then we'll see about that.

552
00:26:54,628 --> 00:26:55,908
If the heavens don't favor us

553
00:26:57,388 --> 00:26:58,547
on the day of battle,

554
00:26:59,547 --> 00:27:00,148
what then?

555
00:27:03,628 --> 00:27:04,987
Every inch of Jiyang's land

556
00:27:06,428 --> 00:27:07,908
can become our burial ground.

557
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:11,987
This is the conviction

558
00:27:13,108 --> 00:27:14,267
every soldier should possess.

559
00:27:15,108 --> 00:27:17,987
Rather die with shattered wings

560
00:27:18,628 --> 00:27:21,507
than endure separation
amidst the clouds.

561
00:27:26,668 --> 00:27:27,267
Today,

562
00:27:28,868 --> 00:27:29,868
the weather is clear.

563
00:28:07,588 --> 00:28:08,388
What's your plan?

564
00:28:09,227 --> 00:28:10,787
They've suddenly forced their march.

565
00:28:11,668 --> 00:28:13,868
If we want to win with fewer people,

566
00:28:14,707 --> 00:28:15,987
holding fortresses is crucial.

567
00:28:28,148 --> 00:28:28,840
Go.

568
00:28:36,188 --> 00:28:36,948
Be careful.

569
00:28:39,868 --> 00:28:40,428
Hurry.

570
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:41,352
Go.

571
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:42,787
Let's go there.

572
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:43,987
Hurry.

573
00:28:44,227 --> 00:28:45,108
Go.

574
00:28:47,507 --> 00:28:48,067
Young Master,

575
00:28:48,507 --> 00:28:49,707
as the Military Inspector,

576
00:28:49,868 --> 00:28:51,227
you've done more than enough.

577
00:28:51,588 --> 00:28:52,388
You can't fight.

578
00:28:52,547 --> 00:28:53,428
For your safety,

579
00:28:53,588 --> 00:28:54,547
please leave the city.

580
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:55,668
Leave this to me.

581
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:58,227
I took on from Her Highness

582
00:28:58,547 --> 00:28:59,307
the evacuation

583
00:28:59,307 --> 00:29:00,588
and resettlement.

584
00:29:00,987 --> 00:29:01,948
I must finish it.

585
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:03,828
I can't abandon the people

586
00:29:03,987 --> 00:29:04,747
to save myself.

587
00:29:05,428 --> 00:29:06,027
Moreover,

588
00:29:06,348 --> 00:29:07,348
Chai Anxi isn't found.

589
00:29:07,707 --> 00:29:08,547
If I leave alone,

590
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,027
how will I face my master?

591
00:29:10,948 --> 00:29:11,507
But...

592
00:29:11,507 --> 00:29:12,307
I've decided.

593
00:29:13,227 --> 00:29:13,864
Over here.

594
00:29:16,467 --> 00:29:17,227
Move aside!

595
00:29:24,188 --> 00:29:25,027
Thank you, sir.

596
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:29,307
Anyone else disrupting order

597
00:29:30,307 --> 00:29:31,388
will be executed.

598
00:29:35,868 --> 00:29:37,188
Are you alright, sir?

599
00:29:38,628 --> 00:29:39,507
I'm fine. I'm fine.

600
00:29:40,388 --> 00:29:41,428
Thank you.

601
00:29:42,267 --> 00:29:43,227
There's an empty house

602
00:29:43,507 --> 00:29:44,467
ahead sheltering

603
00:29:44,547 --> 00:29:45,668
lost elders and children.

604
00:29:46,188 --> 00:29:46,707
You can

605
00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:48,507
stay there temporarily

606
00:29:48,668 --> 00:29:49,267
for shelter.

607
00:29:49,868 --> 00:29:51,027
Okay, thank you.

608
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:52,267
Yingxiang.

609
00:29:52,628 --> 00:29:53,348
Escort the elder.

610
00:29:53,547 --> 00:29:54,067
Yes.

611
00:29:56,188 --> 00:29:56,828
Thank you.

612
00:30:31,948 --> 00:30:32,467
Mr. Chu.

613
00:30:34,067 --> 00:30:34,628
Mr. Chu.

614
00:30:37,188 --> 00:30:37,868
Are you alright?

615
00:30:40,148 --> 00:30:40,668
I'm fine.

616
00:30:40,987 --> 00:30:41,507
Thank you.

617
00:30:43,428 --> 00:30:44,828
When I bought the sugar painting,

618
00:30:44,987 --> 00:30:45,948
I noticed you seemed

619
00:30:46,188 --> 00:30:47,188
uneasy around fire.

620
00:30:47,588 --> 00:30:49,507
Mr. Chu, are you afraid of fire?

621
00:30:50,547 --> 00:30:51,668
(Smoke him out to cleanse)

622
00:30:51,787 --> 00:30:52,428
(bad luck!)

623
00:30:52,908 --> 00:30:54,307
- Yes!
- Yes!

624
00:30:54,388 --> 00:30:54,908
Do it.

625
00:30:55,507 --> 00:30:56,188
Smoke him out.

626
00:30:56,467 --> 00:30:57,507
Your mother eloped.

627
00:30:57,547 --> 00:30:58,307
Serves you right.

628
00:30:58,668 --> 00:30:59,908
You fatherless boy.

629
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,027
Illegitimate.

630
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,267
Don't insult my mother!

631
00:31:05,267 --> 00:31:06,348
Mother.

632
00:31:06,507 --> 00:31:07,868
Mother.

633
00:31:10,507 --> 00:31:11,507
It's okay.

634
00:31:11,507 --> 00:31:12,668
Mother.

635
00:31:13,948 --> 00:31:14,467
Mr. Chu.

636
00:31:17,987 --> 00:31:18,547
Mr. Chu.

637
00:31:18,908 --> 00:31:19,467
I'm sorry.

638
00:31:19,707 --> 00:31:20,547
I shouldn't ask you.

639
00:31:22,388 --> 00:31:23,016
It's okay.

640
00:31:23,987 --> 00:31:24,787
Thank you.

641
00:31:25,987 --> 00:31:26,507
Mr. Chu.

642
00:31:26,707 --> 00:31:28,027
You've already thanked me.

643
00:31:29,428 --> 00:31:30,388
I just remembered it.

644
00:31:30,628 --> 00:31:31,588
I have a garment

645
00:31:31,588 --> 00:31:33,188
made of mermaid silk fabric.

646
00:31:33,588 --> 00:31:34,428
The merchant claimed

647
00:31:34,428 --> 00:31:35,828
clothes crafted from this material

648
00:31:36,148 --> 00:31:36,987
are swordproof

649
00:31:37,188 --> 00:31:38,108
and resistant to fire.

650
00:31:38,908 --> 00:31:39,628
I'll have it sent

651
00:31:39,668 --> 00:31:40,588
to you later, Mr. Chu.

652
00:31:40,828 --> 00:31:41,428
This way,

653
00:31:41,428 --> 00:31:42,547
you won't fear flames.

654
00:31:44,108 --> 00:31:44,987
It's settled then.

655
00:31:45,787 --> 00:31:47,428
Mr. Chu, I'll go patrol.

656
00:31:47,668 --> 00:31:48,467
Stay cautious.

657
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:49,547
Be careful.

658
00:31:52,307 --> 00:31:52,872
Let's go.

659
00:32:00,707 --> 00:32:01,628
We just got news.

660
00:32:02,227 --> 00:32:02,908
The Wutuo Army

661
00:32:02,908 --> 00:32:03,707
suddenly sped up.

662
00:32:04,348 --> 00:32:05,467
They're 20 li

663
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:06,148
outside

664
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:07,227
the south gate.

665
00:32:07,707 --> 00:32:08,267
I suspect

666
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:09,747
they've got news

667
00:32:09,987 --> 00:32:11,227
about you being in Jiyang.

668
00:32:11,828 --> 00:32:12,948
They've always feared you.

669
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:14,547
Knowing you're here,

670
00:32:14,948 --> 00:32:15,908
they'll surely exploit

671
00:32:16,188 --> 00:32:17,267
the lack of coordination

672
00:32:17,428 --> 00:32:18,507
between you and the troops

673
00:32:18,787 --> 00:32:19,747
to strike swiftly.

674
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:21,828
For us to overcome their numbers,

675
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:24,227
speed will be crucial.

676
00:32:24,628 --> 00:32:25,320
So,

677
00:32:25,707 --> 00:32:26,747
this is our opportunity.

678
00:32:27,148 --> 00:32:27,668
True.

679
00:32:27,868 --> 00:32:29,307
Our troops' morale is high.

680
00:32:29,707 --> 00:32:30,948
Civilians are encouraged.

681
00:32:31,267 --> 00:32:32,067
Both united

682
00:32:32,148 --> 00:32:32,948
to strike.

683
00:32:33,227 --> 00:32:34,707
This is our moment to repel Wutuo.

684
00:32:35,348 --> 00:32:36,108
But

685
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:37,507
Jiyang's limited forces

686
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,908
remain our critical weakness.

687
00:32:39,227 --> 00:32:40,108
We need unusual ideas

688
00:32:40,307 --> 00:32:41,507
to reverse our fortunes.

689
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,227
This time,

690
00:32:42,868 --> 00:32:43,828
the Wutuo commander

691
00:32:44,148 --> 00:32:44,868
is Huyate.

692
00:32:45,828 --> 00:32:46,747
Courageous in combat

693
00:32:46,987 --> 00:32:48,307
but stubbornly self-assured,

694
00:32:49,027 --> 00:32:50,428
with limited skill

695
00:32:50,787 --> 00:32:51,628
in formations.

696
00:32:51,948 --> 00:32:54,307
Disrupting his formation

697
00:32:54,828 --> 00:32:55,828
is key to victory.

698
00:32:56,868 --> 00:32:58,467
I've heard of Huyate.

699
00:32:58,987 --> 00:33:00,307
His heavy-armored troops

700
00:33:00,467 --> 00:33:01,227
are tough.

701
00:33:01,707 --> 00:33:02,987
But it decides the battle.

702
00:33:03,868 --> 00:33:05,307
You seem well-informed

703
00:33:05,628 --> 00:33:06,388
about Huyate.

704
00:33:09,868 --> 00:33:10,428
Commander,

705
00:33:10,828 --> 00:33:11,588
after all,

706
00:33:11,588 --> 00:33:12,868
I aspire to be a general.

707
00:33:13,227 --> 00:33:14,908
It's my duty

708
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:15,908
to study

709
00:33:16,067 --> 00:33:16,948
potential adversaries.

710
00:33:17,668 --> 00:33:18,216
See?

711
00:33:18,507 --> 00:33:19,908
This knowledge proves useful now.

712
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:21,032
Commander.

713
00:33:22,908 --> 00:33:23,560
Commander.

714
00:33:24,267 --> 00:33:25,547
During the evacuation today,

715
00:33:25,948 --> 00:33:26,707
my men stationed

716
00:33:26,747 --> 00:33:27,707
at checkpoints

717
00:33:28,188 --> 00:33:28,707
didn't find

718
00:33:28,747 --> 00:33:29,547
Chai Anxi.

719
00:33:30,227 --> 00:33:30,868
He likely

720
00:33:31,027 --> 00:33:32,067
hasn't fled the city yet.

721
00:33:32,467 --> 00:33:33,588
In that case,

722
00:33:34,108 --> 00:33:34,987
he probably plans

723
00:33:35,027 --> 00:33:35,948
to escape

724
00:33:36,108 --> 00:33:37,027
once the battle begins.

725
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:37,948
But by then,

726
00:33:37,987 --> 00:33:39,227
the city will be surrounded,

727
00:33:39,628 --> 00:33:40,908
and we'll be stretched too thin.

728
00:33:42,868 --> 00:33:43,987
Continue the checks.

729
00:33:44,348 --> 00:33:45,227
Stay vigilant.

730
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,467
If war truly breaks out,

731
00:33:49,108 --> 00:33:49,704
our priority

732
00:33:50,227 --> 00:33:51,227
is to defend Jiyang.

733
00:33:52,067 --> 00:33:52,648
Yes.

734
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:18,308
(I've guarded)

735
00:34:19,388 --> 00:34:21,027
(this city for over two decades.)

736
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:23,147
(This time,)

737
00:34:24,348 --> 00:34:25,828
(I will surely protect it again.)

738
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:04,027
(Master.)

739
00:35:04,547 --> 00:35:05,308
The Mengji throne

740
00:35:05,428 --> 00:35:06,987
doesn't require marriage alliances.

741
00:35:07,587 --> 00:35:09,228
Through generations
of rulers' diligence,

742
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:10,308
they won over the people.

743
00:35:10,547 --> 00:35:12,948
Diligent governance is crucial,

744
00:35:13,187 --> 00:35:14,788
but through history,

745
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:16,667
no woman has ever inherited the throne.

746
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:18,507
Hongjin is Prince Mengji's sole child.

747
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:19,587
Legitimate.

748
00:35:20,027 --> 00:35:21,067
(Taoist Yunji)
A brave and smart woman

749
00:35:21,228 --> 00:35:22,187
rivals any man.

750
00:35:22,228 --> 00:35:23,908
These are just your personal views.

751
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:26,187
Though laws never stipulated

752
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:28,908
only men can inherit the throne,

753
00:35:29,868 --> 00:35:31,667
some traditions

754
00:35:32,348 --> 00:35:33,828
have become unspoken rules

755
00:35:33,987 --> 00:35:35,268
in the public's mind.

756
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:36,987
Her gender alone

757
00:35:37,147 --> 00:35:39,147
gives opponents ground to challenge her.

758
00:35:39,627 --> 00:35:41,547
Hongjin will prove to the world

759
00:35:42,187 --> 00:35:43,388
she surpasses her ancestors.

760
00:35:44,987 --> 00:35:46,228
I'll stand by her side.

761
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,547
The nobles in Jiyang

762
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:50,107
won't grant her that time.

763
00:35:50,788 --> 00:35:51,467
Now,

764
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:52,708
only marriage

765
00:35:53,507 --> 00:35:55,268
can stabilize the situation

766
00:35:55,507 --> 00:35:56,708
and her position swiftly.

767
00:35:56,868 --> 00:35:57,828
I believe

768
00:35:58,308 --> 00:35:59,547
heaven never seals all doors.

769
00:35:59,788 --> 00:36:00,828
We can defy our destiny.

770
00:36:01,268 --> 00:36:02,948
You two might challenge fate,

771
00:36:03,547 --> 00:36:05,467
but victory demands sacrifice.

772
00:36:06,348 --> 00:36:07,627
Don't tell me

773
00:36:07,908 --> 00:36:08,908
you fear no hardship.

774
00:36:09,987 --> 00:36:10,788
The suffering

775
00:36:11,228 --> 00:36:13,428
won't just burden you two.

776
00:36:14,187 --> 00:36:15,268
When turmoil erupts,

777
00:36:16,027 --> 00:36:17,507
countless Jiyang citizens

778
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:18,388
will inevitably

779
00:36:18,388 --> 00:36:20,467
endure hardships because of you.

780
00:36:23,627 --> 00:36:24,228
