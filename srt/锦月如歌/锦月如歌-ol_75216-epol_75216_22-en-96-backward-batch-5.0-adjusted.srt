Gentlemen,

24
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:41,227
fate brought us together

25
00:01:41,427 --> 00:01:42,268
at the academy.

26
00:01:42,507 --> 00:01:43,947
Why don't you talk things through?

27
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:44,628
Cheng Lisu,

28
00:01:45,388 --> 00:01:46,067
you may not know.

29
00:01:47,947 --> 00:01:49,468
There is no misunderstanding

30
00:01:50,507 --> 00:01:51,427
between us.

31
00:01:54,227 --> 00:01:54,787
Right.

32
00:01:55,427 --> 00:01:56,268
No misunderstandings.

33
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:57,828
In the end,

34
00:01:58,947 --> 00:01:59,507
I'm nothing

35
00:01:59,628 --> 00:02:01,108
but an oath-breaker.

36
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:18,627
Look!

37
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:28,768
(Hua Youxian)

38
00:02:46,587 --> 00:02:47,467
Hua Youxian?

39
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:49,388
She was

40
00:02:49,388 --> 00:02:50,467
the top of the Ruyun House,

41
00:02:50,747 --> 00:02:51,707
unmatched in Yaojing.

42
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:54,068
How could she end up in Chonghuai?

43
00:03:13,828 --> 00:03:14,388
Bravo!

44
00:03:14,668 --> 00:03:15,228
Great!

45
00:03:17,268 --> 00:03:17,948
You are

46
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:18,867
gracefully charming.

47
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:20,627
You truly deserve

48
00:03:20,627 --> 00:03:21,988
the Ruyun House's reputation.

49
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:24,268
Your heavenly voice

50
00:03:24,467 --> 00:03:25,548
lives up to its fame.

51
00:03:26,187 --> 00:03:26,948
Our money

52
00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:28,388
was well spent indeed.

53
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:08,307
Years have passed.

54
00:04:08,587 --> 00:04:09,388
How have you been?

55
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:10,624
All is well.

56
00:04:10,948 --> 00:04:11,468
Miss Hua,

57
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:12,192
and you?

58
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:13,148
I'm well, too.

59
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:14,668
Speaking of which,

60
00:04:15,028 --> 00:04:16,148
I share a special connection

61
00:04:16,187 --> 00:04:17,028
with you all.

62
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,148
Back then,

63
00:04:18,627 --> 00:04:19,668
I received

64
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:21,427
a love letter from one of you.

65
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:25,228
Certain people
always chase after beauties.

66
00:04:25,747 --> 00:04:26,827
It must be his work.

67
00:04:27,427 --> 00:04:28,468
Back then, I ranked

68
00:04:28,507 --> 00:04:30,187
second to last at Xianchang Academy.

69
00:04:30,507 --> 00:04:31,108
I couldn't even

70
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:32,228
write proper essays,

71
00:04:32,588 --> 00:04:33,867
let alone love letters.

72
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,348
To prove your innocence to Miss Song,

73
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:37,588
you're exposing this.

74
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:40,028
Huaijin excels in

75
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:41,468
arts and martial skills.

76
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,108
He always ranked first

77
00:04:43,387 --> 00:04:44,307
at the academy.

78
00:04:44,627 --> 00:04:45,507
I bet this letter

79
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:46,507
was his doing.

80
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:49,267
See? He's not denying it.

81
00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:49,908
It's a yes.

82
00:04:50,427 --> 00:04:51,148
A penalty drink.

83
00:04:51,548 --> 00:04:52,187
Definitely him.

84
00:04:52,747 --> 00:04:54,588
Who knew you would

85
00:04:54,588 --> 00:04:56,028
have such a romantic side?

86
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,148
General Fengyun, since you are here,

87
00:05:02,788 --> 00:05:04,187
as the local magistrate,

88
00:05:04,627 --> 00:05:05,588
I should host you.

89
00:05:06,627 --> 00:05:07,908
Tomorrow, I'll prepare a banquet

90
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,867
and hope you'll come.

91
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:15,387
It's rare for me to come.

92
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:17,108
Miss Hua, would you like

93
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:18,548
to drink with me?

94
00:05:26,988 --> 00:05:28,028
Of course,

95
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:29,627
I would like to.

96
00:05:41,468 --> 00:05:42,588
Mr. Yang,

97
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:44,668
why the long face?

98
00:06:11,908 --> 00:06:12,788
Speaking of which,

99
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:13,988
Miss Hua,

100
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,588
what brought you to Chonghuai?

101
00:06:18,788 --> 00:06:19,988
I met a gentleman.

102
00:06:21,307 --> 00:06:21,947
Believing him

103
00:06:22,588 --> 00:06:23,307
to be

104
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:24,548
my lifelong partner.

105
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:26,228
I bought my freedom

106
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:28,348
and married him.

107
00:06:29,148 --> 00:06:29,908
So

108
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:31,708
you are married?

109
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:33,827
Yes.

110
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:36,348
But

111
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:38,627
my judgment failed me.

112
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:39,867
Eventually,

113
00:06:40,387 --> 00:06:41,148
we divorced.

114
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:46,947
Why the separation?

115
00:06:48,427 --> 00:06:49,747
I entrusted myself

116
00:06:49,988 --> 00:06:50,747
to the wrong man.

117
00:06:52,028 --> 00:06:52,908
You were

118
00:06:52,988 --> 00:06:54,228
once renowned across the land.

119
00:06:54,827 --> 00:06:56,307
I heard of your legendary fame, too.

120
00:06:57,028 --> 00:06:59,228
Choosing marriage at your career's peak

121
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:00,827
meant you held

122
00:07:00,827 --> 00:07:01,827
deep affection for him.

123
00:07:06,387 --> 00:07:08,627
When I left the Ruyun House, the madam

124
00:07:09,108 --> 00:07:09,788
asked me,

125
00:07:11,028 --> 00:07:12,788
"Have you ever seen a moth fly

126
00:07:12,908 --> 00:07:14,028
into a flame and end well?"

127
00:07:14,988 --> 00:07:16,588
I was young then

128
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:18,148
and firmly believed

129
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:19,668
that even a fleeting moment

130
00:07:20,028 --> 00:07:21,668
of warmth would be worth chasing.

131
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:24,028
I naturally fell for him

132
00:07:24,468 --> 00:07:25,307
and left with him

133
00:07:25,427 --> 00:07:26,187
without hesitation.

134
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:29,028
Later,

135
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,267
our affection dissipated,

136
00:07:33,228 --> 00:07:34,348
so I left him.

137
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:36,067
Isn't that human nature?

138
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:43,627
Now,

139
00:07:43,988 --> 00:07:45,067
I live freely

140
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:45,827
in this city,

141
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:47,827
self-sufficient and unbound.

142
00:07:48,028 --> 00:07:49,028
So joyful.

143
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:51,507
I've never regretted

144
00:07:51,668 --> 00:07:52,947
any decision I've made,

145
00:07:53,627 --> 00:07:55,427
be it past or present.

146
00:07:57,468 --> 00:07:58,827
Your clarity of purpose

147
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:00,507
is admirable.

148
00:08:02,267 --> 00:08:03,228
Let me toast to you.

149
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:08,947
Thank you,

150
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:10,267
Miss.

151
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:14,827
You have sharp eyes.

152
00:08:22,947 --> 00:08:25,228
Your dance is captivating

153
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:26,627
and famous.

154
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:28,387
Now, you're single.

155
00:08:29,188 --> 00:08:29,948
Our garrison has

156
00:08:29,988 --> 00:08:31,108
many outstanding young men.

157
00:08:31,747 --> 00:08:32,308
Perhaps

158
00:08:32,787 --> 00:08:34,228
some might suit your standards?

159
00:08:37,147 --> 00:08:38,787
Your brave warriors

160
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:41,108
are certainly worthy of me.

161
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:45,108
Xiao Jue.

162
00:08:46,147 --> 00:08:46,907
What do you mean?

163
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:48,588
(He's egging him on.)

164
00:08:48,787 --> 00:08:50,348
Both are unwed.

165
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:51,747
Why not play

166
00:08:52,468 --> 00:08:53,348
the matchmaker?

167
00:08:58,988 --> 00:08:59,747
It's my marriage.

168
00:09:00,308 --> 00:09:01,228
None of your concern.

169
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:02,787
I...

170
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:04,308
I...

171
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:10,708
Miss Hua is beautiful and skilled in

172
00:09:10,828 --> 00:09:11,547
song and dance.

173
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:12,667
She deserves

174
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,188
a promising young partner.

175
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:15,667
Why do you object?

176
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:16,907
Exactly. Huaijin.

177
00:09:17,468 --> 00:09:18,147
Go introduce her

178
00:09:18,147 --> 00:09:18,867
to some brave ones

179
00:09:18,988 --> 00:09:19,828
of your men.

180
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:22,428
Naturally.

181
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,027
Xiao Jue.

182
00:09:31,547 --> 00:09:32,108
Youxian.

183
00:09:33,627 --> 00:09:34,428
The love letter

184
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:36,027
was from you, right?

185
00:09:38,348 --> 00:09:39,068
Her ex-husband

186
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:40,468
is also you.

187
00:09:40,907 --> 00:09:42,308
So it was you all along.

188
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:46,267
Back then,

189
00:09:46,988 --> 00:09:48,027
we were both young.

190
00:09:58,387 --> 00:10:00,188
I want to buy your freedom.

191
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:02,108
I wonder

192
00:10:02,828 --> 00:10:03,747
if you would like

193
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:06,188
to become my wife?

194
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,867
Our backgrounds are worlds apart.

195
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:21,228
Marriage isn't a game.

196
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,747
There's too much at stake.

197
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:26,188
Let me think again.

198
00:10:26,948 --> 00:10:27,787
Stop right there!

199
00:10:29,787 --> 00:10:32,308
Dreaming of marrying a courtesan?

200
00:10:32,988 --> 00:10:34,147
You'll disgrace our family!

201
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,188
Defending a traitor against your father?

202
00:10:37,507 --> 00:10:38,468
Leave now,

203
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,387
and you're no longer a Yang!

204
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,308
Don't come back ever!

205
00:10:57,627 --> 00:10:59,068
Why torture yourself?

206
00:11:05,228 --> 00:11:06,387
Come away with me.

207
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:11,188
Alright.

208
00:11:11,988 --> 00:11:12,988
I'll go with you.

209
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:19,840
(Yang Mansion)

210
00:11:23,428 --> 00:11:24,308
I'm worthless.

211
00:11:28,108 --> 00:11:28,787
Tell me.

212
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:31,068
What's truly burdening you?

213
00:11:34,147 --> 00:11:34,828
Tell me!

214
00:11:43,907 --> 00:11:44,627
Give back my wine.

215
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:54,667
Enough.

216
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:57,708
Let's divorce.

217
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:01,907
May we

218
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:03,708
never meet again.

219
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:14,507
I'm unworthy.

220
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:16,188
Mingzhi,

221
00:12:16,747 --> 00:12:18,188
how could you be so blind?

222
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:20,787
You never compromised your will

223
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:22,468
or dignity.

224
00:12:23,147 --> 00:12:24,988
So free-spirited and open-hearted.

225
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:26,667
Truly admirable.

226
00:12:27,027 --> 00:12:29,228
You should be our role model as women.

227
00:12:30,828 --> 00:12:31,507
I'm flattered.

228
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:33,068
Life is too short

229
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:34,747
to waste on self-compromise.

230
00:12:41,147 --> 00:12:41,708
Youxian.

231
00:12:44,027 --> 00:12:44,667
You...

232
00:12:46,188 --> 00:12:47,108
failed the Commander

233
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:48,907
and then Miss Hua.

234
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:51,348
A blind and foolish man.

235
00:12:53,627 --> 00:12:54,308
I was thinking

236
00:12:57,267 --> 00:12:58,348
back then, the Commander

237
00:12:59,108 --> 00:13:00,588
lost both parents,

238
00:13:01,108 --> 00:13:02,387
his comrades fell in battle,

239
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:04,308
and his friend betrayed him.

240
00:13:04,828 --> 00:13:06,147
Knowing something was wrong

241
00:13:06,588 --> 00:13:07,708
but finding no proof.

242
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,348
That feeling of helplessness

243
00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:12,667
must have been unbearable.

244
00:13:17,147 --> 00:13:18,188
As for Miss Hua,

245
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:19,988
who became your wife,

246
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,948
she deserved your respect,

247
00:13:26,108 --> 00:13:27,507
but you neglected her.

248
00:13:28,547 --> 00:13:29,387
Did you think

249
00:13:29,907 --> 00:13:30,627
avoiding violence

250
00:13:31,108 --> 00:13:31,787
meant keeping

251
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:32,948
your gentleman's code?

252
00:13:34,027 --> 00:13:34,747
Don't you know

253
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:37,308
complete indifference and neglect

254
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:38,867
hurt more than blows?

255
00:13:39,948 --> 00:13:40,828
It means

256
00:13:41,507 --> 00:13:42,428
from your heart

257
00:13:43,387 --> 00:13:44,428
to your eyes,

258
00:13:45,747 --> 00:13:47,308
she ceased to exist.

259
00:13:59,468 --> 00:14:00,787
My father's wrongful conviction

260
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,588
has nothing to do with you.

261
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,108
I never expected

262
00:14:05,787 --> 00:14:06,507
your single word

263
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:08,228
to change everything.

264
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:10,308
I did resent you

265
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,867
for your disrespectful remarks,

266
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,228
but that's in the past.

267
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:17,267
We're but specks

268
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:18,828
in the vast river of time,

269
00:14:19,428 --> 00:14:20,387
gone in an instant.

270
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:23,108
I won't lecture you,

271
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,228
nor should you trap yourself.

272
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:30,988
When you're at rock bottom,

273
00:14:31,948 --> 00:14:33,308
every step taken

274
00:14:34,988 --> 00:14:35,988
is upward progress.

275
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:38,787
Escapism and despair achieve nothing.

276
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:41,108
I'll find the truth to clear

277
00:14:42,027 --> 00:14:42,867
my father's name

278
00:14:44,027 --> 00:14:45,027
and restore honor

279
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:48,068
to the Xiao Army.

280
00:14:49,907 --> 00:14:50,948
That day will come.

281
00:14:55,787 --> 00:14:56,867
As for Miss Hua,

282
00:14:58,108 --> 00:14:59,228
rather than feeling guilty,

283
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:00,907
take action instead.

284
00:15:02,147 --> 00:15:03,068
Self-pity

285
00:15:04,228 --> 00:15:05,068
is utterly useless.

286
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:13,147
Stop drinking.

287
00:15:13,308 --> 00:15:13,948
You'll be drunk.

288
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:17,547
Do you have troubles, Miss?

289
00:15:24,468 --> 00:15:26,828
I made a righteous lecture earlier,

290
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:30,988
but I'm just a deserter myself.

291
00:15:31,988 --> 00:15:33,188
What right do I have

292
00:15:33,468 --> 00:15:35,027
to criticize Yang Mingzhi?

293
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:38,828
How ridiculous.

294
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:42,747
You must have

295
00:15:44,147 --> 00:15:45,308
your own struggles, too.

296
00:15:53,547 --> 00:15:54,948
My minor troubles

297
00:15:56,228 --> 00:15:57,867
pale compared to his suffering.

298
00:15:59,428 --> 00:16:00,547
They're insignificant.

299
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:05,428
But I see your pain.

300
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:26,588
Youxian.

301
00:16:38,468 --> 00:16:39,108
I was wrong.

302
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,068
I won't ask your forgiveness.

303
00:16:42,907 --> 00:16:43,667
I just wish

304
00:16:44,988 --> 00:16:46,428
to return to your side.

305
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,907
If possible,

306
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:51,387
I want to make up

307
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:52,348
for the hurt I caused.

308
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:54,948
It is

309
00:16:56,988 --> 00:16:57,747
none of my concern.

310
00:16:59,908 --> 00:17:00,468
Youxian.

311
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:07,948
Youxian.

312
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:09,388
That's my only wish.

313
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:11,228
You can ignore me,

314
00:17:11,908 --> 00:17:12,547
reject me,

315
00:17:13,628 --> 00:17:14,948
but I want to stay with you

316
00:17:18,628 --> 00:17:19,908
because I truly love you.

317
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:51,787
Actually...

318
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,107
Actually, I...

319
00:18:00,468 --> 00:18:02,188
How much did you drink tonight?

320
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:06,228
Will you hate me?

321
00:18:15,307 --> 00:18:15,872
Commander.

322
00:18:18,827 --> 00:18:19,347
Commander.

323
00:18:22,827 --> 00:18:23,747
He Yan let me

324
00:18:23,787 --> 00:18:25,107
deliver this letter to you.

325
00:18:29,628 --> 00:18:31,988
(By the riverside pavilion,
awaiting our conversation.)

326
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:33,188
(I'll be waiting.)

327
00:18:33,507 --> 00:18:34,988
You see each other every day.

328
00:18:35,107 --> 00:18:36,468
Why write letters instead of

329
00:18:36,868 --> 00:18:37,587
speaking directly?

330
00:18:44,988 --> 00:18:45,708
Mr. Xiao.

331
00:18:48,988 --> 00:18:49,628
Miss Hua.

332
00:18:51,827 --> 00:18:52,547
I came here

333
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:53,827
to thank you.

334
00:18:54,228 --> 00:18:54,868
Why?

335
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,267
You went to great trouble

336
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:57,148
to help

337
00:18:57,267 --> 00:18:58,148
Yang Mingzhi and me.

338
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:00,587
I'm deeply grateful.

339
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:04,307
I wanted to beat him up,

340
00:19:04,908 --> 00:19:06,868
but the opportunity slipped away.

341
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:11,107
So you're blaming me, Mr. Xiao?

342
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:13,868
His choice to be with me

343
00:19:13,948 --> 00:19:14,628
is his freedom.

344
00:19:15,228 --> 00:19:16,307
And how I choose to respond

345
00:19:16,628 --> 00:19:17,428
is mine.

346
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:18,547
Good then.

347
00:19:19,347 --> 00:19:19,988
I'm sorry.

348
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:21,267
I have to go.

349
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:23,584
By the way,

350
00:19:24,668 --> 00:19:26,188
someone came with you to Ruyun House

351
00:19:26,468 --> 00:19:27,587
back then too.

352
00:19:28,347 --> 00:19:29,468
I remember very clearly.

353
00:19:30,107 --> 00:19:31,188
Delicate yet determined,

354
00:19:31,468 --> 00:19:32,307
wearing a mask,

355
00:19:32,747 --> 00:19:34,027
refusing to reveal the identity.

356
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:36,067
Where is the person now?

357
00:19:37,908 --> 00:19:38,868
All things pass away.

358
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:41,067
Not worth mentioning.

359
00:19:44,668 --> 00:19:45,468
So,

360
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,747
you two have grown distant?

361
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:49,948
Right.

362
00:19:50,228 --> 00:19:52,027
You've been battling everywhere.

363
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:53,307
It must've been hard

364
00:19:53,347 --> 00:19:54,347
for you to stay in touch.

365
00:19:55,307 --> 00:19:56,908
After all, she's a lady.

366
00:20:01,428 --> 00:20:02,148
What?

367
00:20:05,948 --> 00:20:07,388
Don't you know, Mr. Xiao?

368
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,468
She wore a chest binder

369
00:20:10,228 --> 00:20:11,267
and acted so nervous.

370
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,908
When I casually teased her,

371
00:20:13,067 --> 00:20:14,188
she became flustered.

372
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,787
That shy, nervous demeanor
could only belong

373
00:20:17,188 --> 00:20:18,027
to a young lady.

374
00:20:18,388 --> 00:20:19,668
My eyes never deceive me.

375
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:26,267
(Yunlai Inn)

376
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:27,267
Strangely enough,

377
00:20:27,908 --> 00:20:28,948
He Rufei's sister

378
00:20:29,668 --> 00:20:31,027
is also called

379
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:31,868
He Yan.

380
00:20:35,347 --> 00:20:36,428
A woman like you

381
00:20:37,307 --> 00:20:39,468
joined Yezhou Garrison as a new recruit.

382
00:20:40,267 --> 00:20:41,668
There must be a hidden story.

383
00:20:42,547 --> 00:20:43,428
The day will come

384
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,107
when your secrets are uncovered.

385
00:20:46,988 --> 00:20:48,347
What secrets could I have?

386
00:20:49,188 --> 00:20:50,107
We were simply

387
00:20:51,027 --> 00:20:52,228
meant to meet each other.

388
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:56,628
Beware of He Rufei.

389
00:20:57,827 --> 00:20:58,988
He made me hold back

390
00:20:59,027 --> 00:21:00,587
General Xiao's plea for help

391
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,868
for a few days.

392
00:21:03,507 --> 00:21:04,468
Beware of whom?

393
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:08,668
(Who are you really?)

394
00:21:09,628 --> 00:21:11,267
(Miss He Yan from the He family?)

395
00:21:11,747 --> 00:21:12,668
(Or He Rufei, the one)

396
00:21:12,668 --> 00:21:14,307
(from back then who was afraid)

397
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:16,507
(to show his true face?)

398
00:21:18,267 --> 00:21:19,468
(If you're He Rufei,)

399
00:21:20,228 --> 00:21:21,747
(then who is the current He Rufei?)

400
00:21:22,388 --> 00:21:24,027
(If you're the He Rufei of old,)

401
00:21:24,148 --> 00:21:24,868
(why would you)

402
00:21:25,347 --> 00:21:26,787
(abandon us in our direst hour?)

403
00:22:39,347 --> 00:22:39,904
Commander.

404
00:22:47,188 --> 00:22:48,787
You do know the Xiao's sword techniques.

405
00:22:49,388 --> 00:22:50,107
You've found out.

406
00:22:50,587 --> 00:22:51,787
The Qinglang Sword Style

407
00:22:52,388 --> 00:22:53,388
is known by the Xiaos

408
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:55,668
and one other person only.

409
00:22:59,067 --> 00:22:59,628
Exactly.

410
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:03,347
I was once He Rufei.

411
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:05,787
That's not my true name.

412
00:23:06,827 --> 00:23:07,787
I am He Yan,

413
00:23:08,827 --> 00:23:09,587
the stepsister

414
00:23:09,628 --> 00:23:10,668
of the current He Rufei.

415
00:23:11,827 --> 00:23:12,787
From childhood,

416
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:15,067
our identities were swapped.

417
00:23:15,948 --> 00:23:16,948
You exchanged identities?

418
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:18,587
I've been He Rufei

419
00:23:19,027 --> 00:23:20,267
for as long as I can remember.

420
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:21,468
They claimed

421
00:23:21,908 --> 00:23:23,267
my brother wouldn't live long.

422
00:23:23,908 --> 00:23:25,307
I had to impersonate He Rufei,

423
00:23:26,188 --> 00:23:27,307
or the family's noble title

424
00:23:27,787 --> 00:23:28,747
would be revoked.

425
00:23:30,468 --> 00:23:31,267
So I had no choice

426
00:23:31,347 --> 00:23:32,708
but to live as He Rufei.

427
00:23:34,148 --> 00:23:35,228
But I refused to submit to

428
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:35,988
such a fate.

429
00:23:36,587 --> 00:23:37,587
So I left home and joined

430
00:23:38,107 --> 00:23:39,067
the Fuyue Army.

431
00:23:39,948 --> 00:23:40,787
I earned merits

432
00:23:41,468 --> 00:23:42,307
and received honors,

433
00:23:43,428 --> 00:23:45,067
but my brother who should've died young

434
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:47,628
was still alive.

435
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:49,868
When he returned home,

436
00:23:51,547 --> 00:23:52,787
he poisoned and blinded me.

437
00:23:54,228 --> 00:23:56,267
Then he stole General Feihong's identity

438
00:23:57,468 --> 00:23:59,188
and even tried to kill me.

439
00:24:04,307 --> 00:24:05,507
Perhaps God

440
00:24:06,507 --> 00:24:07,628
took pity on me,

441
00:24:08,587 --> 00:24:09,908
giving me another chance at life.

442
00:24:11,228 --> 00:24:12,787
That's how He Yan came to be.

443
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:14,787
I am He Yan,

444
00:24:15,428 --> 00:24:16,347
but also He Rufei.

445
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,347
I told you I wanted to earn glory.

446
00:24:20,027 --> 00:24:20,787
That wasn't a lie.

447
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:22,507
Because I have to

448
00:24:23,188 --> 00:24:24,107
rise to his level

449
00:24:24,148 --> 00:24:25,148
to expose his lies

450
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,188
and prevent him

451
00:24:29,787 --> 00:24:30,668
from harming

452
00:24:30,747 --> 00:24:31,787
more innocent people.

453
00:24:33,787 --> 00:24:34,908
Anything that belongs to me,

454
00:24:36,307 --> 00:24:37,747
I will reclaim personally.

455
00:24:42,468 --> 00:24:43,468
Xiao Jue, sorry

456
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:45,787
for keeping it from you.

457
00:24:47,107 --> 00:24:48,067
I just didn't know

458
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,067
how to face you.

459
00:24:50,267 --> 00:24:50,948
Only a question.

460
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:52,708
In the Mingshui Battle,

461
00:24:53,628 --> 00:24:55,148
was it you who delayed

462
00:24:56,868 --> 00:24:57,827
the reinforcements?

463
00:25:03,747 --> 00:25:04,388
Yes.

464
00:25:05,428 --> 00:25:06,307
I sent

465
00:25:07,107 --> 00:25:08,587
late reinforcements...

466
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:10,787
30,000 Xiao Army soldiers died,

467
00:25:12,228 --> 00:25:13,868
and my parents died one after another.

468
00:25:14,587 --> 00:25:16,228
There's a conspiracy in the battle. I...

469
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:17,507
After lying to me for so long,

470
00:25:18,388 --> 00:25:19,267
how can you expect me

471
00:25:19,307 --> 00:25:21,067
to believe your one-sided claims?

472
00:25:27,507 --> 00:25:28,107
You're right.

473
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:30,708
I deceived you.

474
00:25:31,587 --> 00:25:32,708
How could I demand

475
00:25:33,428 --> 00:25:34,948
your immediate trust?

476
00:25:40,067 --> 00:25:41,708
But I will find evidence

477
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:43,708
to uncover the truth.

478
00:25:49,107 --> 00:25:50,668
If you don't want to see me again,

479
00:25:53,107 --> 00:25:54,228
