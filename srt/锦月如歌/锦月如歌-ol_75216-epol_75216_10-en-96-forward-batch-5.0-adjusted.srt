23
00:02:08,624 --> 00:02:10,224
What a skilled martial artist.

24
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,880
He actually killed Ding Yi,

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,096
who is He Rufei's

26
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:17,415
right-hand man.

27
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:18,855
Young Master.

28
00:02:19,376 --> 00:02:20,855
What do we do about the bodies?

29
00:02:21,735 --> 00:02:23,255
Sun Xiangfu is a wolf in lamb's skin.

30
00:02:23,408 --> 00:02:24,295
His son Sun Ling

31
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:25,415
is a total animal

32
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:26,936
who abducts women,

33
00:02:27,496 --> 00:02:28,255
assaults them,

34
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:29,336
and then kills them.

35
00:02:30,896 --> 00:02:32,496
Death is too merciful for him.

36
00:02:34,032 --> 00:02:35,255
We're here to get the ledgers

37
00:02:35,695 --> 00:02:37,056
for the Chancellor.

38
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,376
As for those murder victims,

39
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:40,735
I bet Xiao Jue

40
00:02:40,975 --> 00:02:42,135
will do them justice.

41
00:02:42,736 --> 00:02:44,176
We just need to bide our time

42
00:02:44,432 --> 00:02:45,456
amid the chaos.

43
00:02:51,815 --> 00:02:52,496
Yingxiang.

44
00:02:53,575 --> 00:02:54,695
After all these years,

45
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:55,735
you should know

46
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,015
that I stop at nothing

47
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:58,535
to achieve my goals.

48
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:00,456
Compassion

49
00:03:03,415 --> 00:03:04,255
is never my thing.

50
00:03:09,136 --> 00:03:09,855
But Young Master,

51
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:10,735
you...

52
00:03:10,776 --> 00:03:11,575
I willingly chose

53
00:03:11,616 --> 00:03:12,496
this path myself.

54
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,456
Why bother finding

55
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:16,015
high-sounding excuses to justify it?

56
00:03:20,496 --> 00:03:21,015
Commander.

57
00:03:21,776 --> 00:03:23,415
I saw many posters

58
00:03:23,496 --> 00:03:24,656
of missing persons.

59
00:03:25,376 --> 00:03:26,656
They were all women.

60
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:28,015
I bet

61
00:03:28,112 --> 00:03:29,295
it has something to do

62
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,255
with the bodies in the courtyard.

63
00:03:31,975 --> 00:03:33,176
According to Ding Yi,

64
00:03:33,575 --> 00:03:35,456
the forbidden shrine

65
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:36,975
was meant to suppress

66
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:38,896
the vengeful spirits of the victims.

67
00:03:43,664 --> 00:03:44,896
Sun Xiangfu and Sun Ling

68
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:46,815
wanted to deny them peace

69
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:47,815
even in death.

70
00:03:53,168 --> 00:03:54,015
Commander.

71
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:55,776
We must bring justice

72
00:03:55,855 --> 00:03:56,815
to these

73
00:03:57,176 --> 00:03:58,135
murder victims.

74
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:03,496
For something

75
00:04:03,496 --> 00:04:04,535
irreversible like this,

76
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:06,496
it makes little difference

77
00:04:06,776 --> 00:04:07,855
to handle it

78
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:09,575
earlier or later.

79
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:11,456
We should prioritize

80
00:04:11,456 --> 00:04:12,616
the provisions and funds.

81
00:04:13,415 --> 00:04:14,535
But there is a difference.

82
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:16,056
The sooner

83
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,656
we look into it, the sooner

84
00:04:17,936 --> 00:04:19,015
we bring peace

85
00:04:19,015 --> 00:04:20,056
to the victims

86
00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:21,328
and prevent others

87
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:22,256
from falling victim.

88
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:27,576
Commander.

89
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:29,696
Should we really ignore this

90
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:31,016
to secure the funds

91
00:04:31,055 --> 00:04:32,136
and provisions?

92
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,696
Or do you think

93
00:04:41,904 --> 00:04:43,336
these victims are women

94
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:45,735
that this society disregards,

95
00:04:46,096 --> 00:04:47,535
so they don't deserve attention?

96
00:04:49,216 --> 00:04:50,295
I have my plan.

97
00:04:51,175 --> 00:04:52,016
I don't need to

98
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:54,336
explain anything to you.

99
00:05:37,072 --> 00:05:37,776
(These pills)

100
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:38,776
(can stop bleeding.)

101
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:40,055
(Take three.)

102
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:41,935
(Rest in your room.)

103
00:05:44,456 --> 00:05:46,216
Trying to pay me off like this?

104
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:47,935
Since you won't help,

105
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,656
I'll do it my way.

106
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,358
(Notice)

107
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:23,295
He Yan?

108
00:06:24,368 --> 00:06:24,975
Commander.

109
00:06:25,256 --> 00:06:25,855
I met He Yan

110
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:26,896
while investigating

111
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:28,495
the missing women.

112
00:06:33,735 --> 00:06:34,256
It's fine.

113
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,136
Any news from the capital?

114
00:06:36,592 --> 00:06:37,232
Yes.

115
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:38,415
He Rufei has been

116
00:06:38,535 --> 00:06:40,216
eagerly currying favor with Xu Jingfu,

117
00:06:40,696 --> 00:06:42,136
who keeps ignoring him.

118
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:53,735
It probably started a long time ago.

119
00:06:54,656 --> 00:06:55,495
So I was wrong

120
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:56,495
about him back then.

121
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:58,016
He came late

122
00:06:58,016 --> 00:06:59,375
to the Mingshui Battle.

123
00:07:00,935 --> 00:07:01,535
I bet he was

124
00:07:01,535 --> 00:07:02,456
already colluding

125
00:07:02,576 --> 00:07:03,615
with Xu Jingfu.

126
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:07,256
Sending assassins after me

127
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:09,696
is probably another way

128
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:11,216
of pledging allegiance.

129
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:13,576
We must kill him.

130
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,816
I'm acquainted

131
00:07:32,096 --> 00:07:33,096
with He Rufei,

132
00:07:34,064 --> 00:07:34,816
but...

133
00:07:43,408 --> 00:07:44,656
How's it going

134
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,216
with the plan?

135
00:07:46,735 --> 00:07:47,535
All set.

136
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:50,096
Ding Yi vanished.

137
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:51,576
Sun Xiangfu

138
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:53,415
is surely restless.

139
00:07:54,136 --> 00:07:55,096
It's time

140
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,456
to put on the show.

141
00:07:59,816 --> 00:08:00,336
Ding Yi?

142
00:08:01,295 --> 00:08:02,256
I haven't seen him.

143
00:08:02,935 --> 00:08:03,656
Why are you

144
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:04,776
looking for him?

145
00:08:05,256 --> 00:08:06,096
I'll tell him

146
00:08:06,288 --> 00:08:07,175
if I see him.

147
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,375
It's nothing

148
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,495
particularly urgent.

149
00:08:14,776 --> 00:08:16,375
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

150
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:20,216
See you

151
00:08:20,256 --> 00:08:21,256
in the dining hall.

152
00:08:23,776 --> 00:08:24,456
Yingxiang,

153
00:08:24,896 --> 00:08:25,735
keep an eye on him.

154
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:27,656
He failed to kill Xiao Jue.

155
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,136
And Ding Yi vanished.

156
00:08:29,456 --> 00:08:30,256
He must be

157
00:08:30,535 --> 00:08:31,256
restless.

158
00:08:31,855 --> 00:08:32,535
His life

159
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:34,216
depends on those ledgers.

160
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:35,935
He'll guard them carefully.

161
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:37,456
Also,

162
00:08:37,904 --> 00:08:39,096
if you find the ledgers,

163
00:08:39,456 --> 00:08:40,576
lay low to avoid

164
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:42,096
causing commotion.

165
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,135
Understood.

166
00:08:56,975 --> 00:08:58,015
Stop eating.

167
00:08:58,816 --> 00:09:00,216
The guests haven't even arrived.

168
00:09:00,216 --> 00:09:01,056
Father.

169
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:02,855
You're so rude.

170
00:09:03,696 --> 00:09:04,536
As the saying goes,

171
00:09:04,696 --> 00:09:05,655
"Appetite and lust

172
00:09:05,655 --> 00:09:06,536
are human nature."

173
00:09:06,975 --> 00:09:08,775
Are you defying the sages?

174
00:09:09,456 --> 00:09:10,056
You...

175
00:09:11,775 --> 00:09:12,375
Mr. Chu,

176
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:14,135
pardon his poor manners.

177
00:09:16,576 --> 00:09:17,176
Commander Xiao.

178
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:18,216
Mr. Cheng.

179
00:09:22,768 --> 00:09:23,536
Commander Xiao.

180
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:24,255
Mr. Cheng.

181
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,015
I've been waiting for you.

182
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:27,775
Please be seated.

183
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:28,655
Go ahead.

184
00:09:37,015 --> 00:09:38,375
What an extravagant feast.

185
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:40,936
Uncle,

186
00:09:41,495 --> 00:09:43,375
you should learn from Mr. Sun

187
00:09:43,975 --> 00:09:44,975
and be more generous.

188
00:09:45,264 --> 00:09:47,176
Stop being so stingy with me

189
00:09:47,576 --> 00:09:48,456
or mistreating me.

190
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:50,775
Mr. Cheng,

191
00:09:51,735 --> 00:09:53,255
have your eyes recovered?

192
00:09:53,895 --> 00:09:54,576
That's right.

193
00:09:55,015 --> 00:09:56,336
The Chief Imperial Physician

194
00:09:56,336 --> 00:09:57,416
is my master.

195
00:09:57,775 --> 00:09:58,416
I can deal with

196
00:09:58,735 --> 00:09:59,456
petty toxins.

197
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:06,735
I recovered

198
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,056
that very night.

199
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:11,255
Then why did you

200
00:10:11,735 --> 00:10:12,296
waste all our

201
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:13,015
precious herb...?

202
00:10:13,015 --> 00:10:13,584
You brat!

203
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:16,255
- Come on.
- Can you...

204
00:10:16,495 --> 00:10:17,336
- What's wrong?
- Stop...

205
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:18,296
Talking...

206
00:10:18,296 --> 00:10:18,816
Father.

207
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:19,344
Please?

208
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:23,375
Sure.

209
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:30,855
Sorry, Commander.

210
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,816
I've spoiled my son.

211
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:34,056
He spouts nonsense.

212
00:10:35,696 --> 00:10:36,255
It's okay.

213
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:37,655
In fact,

214
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:39,375
I should apologize to you.

215
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:41,336
My nephew

216
00:10:41,336 --> 00:10:42,576
has always been wayward.

217
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,375
He's led a sheltered life,

218
00:10:45,015 --> 00:10:46,176
so this assassination

219
00:10:46,775 --> 00:10:47,735
left him traumatized.

220
00:10:48,495 --> 00:10:50,456
He feared further attacks

221
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,336
and pretended to be blind.

222
00:10:53,712 --> 00:10:54,975
I almost got deceived, too.

223
00:10:57,495 --> 00:10:58,176
It's alright.

224
00:10:59,135 --> 00:10:59,895
In fact,

225
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:01,855
it's rather interesting that Mr. Cheng

226
00:11:02,056 --> 00:11:03,536
pretended to be blind.

227
00:11:04,855 --> 00:11:05,424
Really?

228
00:11:05,424 --> 00:11:06,096
Totally.

229
00:11:06,135 --> 00:11:06,735
I think so.

230
00:11:06,735 --> 00:11:07,576
Exactly.

231
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,375
The dishes are turning cold.

232
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:13,416
Let's eat.

233
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:15,655
I've heard

234
00:11:16,015 --> 00:11:17,176
about the poor harvest

235
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,056
and that the farmers

236
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:20,296
are all behind on payments.

237
00:11:21,176 --> 00:11:22,416
But the previous banquet

238
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:24,216
and this luncheon

239
00:11:25,015 --> 00:11:26,495
are both exceptionally lavish.

240
00:11:27,456 --> 00:11:28,975
There is no sign

241
00:11:29,296 --> 00:11:30,336
of a famine.

242
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:32,336
Or perhaps,

243
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,735
Mr. Sun enjoys heavenly favor,

244
00:11:36,135 --> 00:11:37,255
where only your household

245
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:38,735
receives favorable weather?

246
00:11:40,495 --> 00:11:41,216
I must

247
00:11:41,615 --> 00:11:42,936
thank Heaven.

248
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,975
The famine does exist,

249
00:11:50,936 --> 00:11:51,735
but

250
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:53,855
it's improved significantly.

251
00:11:54,655 --> 00:11:55,336
In that case,

252
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,456
let's discuss military funds.

253
00:12:04,096 --> 00:12:05,576
The Yezhou merchants

254
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:07,615
delay tax payments every year.

255
00:12:08,655 --> 00:12:10,336
That's outrageous.

256
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:11,816
Well,

257
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,576
Mr. Sun,

258
00:12:13,855 --> 00:12:15,015
bring out the tax ledger

259
00:12:15,176 --> 00:12:15,936
and show me

260
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,096
their names.

261
00:12:24,816 --> 00:12:25,456
Commander,

262
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,375
I don't think that's appropriate.

263
00:12:31,135 --> 00:12:33,015
You have shown such hospitality.

264
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,096
I merely wish

265
00:12:34,576 --> 00:12:35,816
to return the favor.

266
00:12:35,975 --> 00:12:37,096
I truly appreciate it.

267
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:37,855
Well,

268
00:12:38,615 --> 00:12:39,855
I won't make it hard for you.

269
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:41,056
Mr. Sun,

270
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,655
give me the names

271
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:44,495
of the tax-evading merchants.

272
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:45,655
I'll host

273
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:47,336
a gathering tomorrow

274
00:12:47,696 --> 00:12:48,456
to give them

275
00:12:49,255 --> 00:12:50,375
a warning on your behalf.

276
00:12:52,816 --> 00:12:53,816
That's inappropriate.

277
00:12:53,855 --> 00:12:54,975
- Those...
- Mr. Sun.

278
00:12:55,615 --> 00:12:57,696
My uncle kindly offered help.

279
00:12:57,936 --> 00:12:59,056
Show some appreciation.

280
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:00,975
Even if you can wait,

281
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,375
the Yezhou Garrison

282
00:13:02,536 --> 00:13:03,576
is in dire need

283
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,216
of provisions and funds.

284
00:13:05,696 --> 00:13:06,296
Mr. Cheng...

285
00:13:06,296 --> 00:13:06,895
Mr. Sun.

286
00:13:07,408 --> 00:13:08,255
Commander Xiao

287
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,735
meant to help.

288
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,456
Please accept his goodwill.

289
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:19,895
Then

290
00:13:20,816 --> 00:13:23,056
thank you, Commander.

291
00:13:25,576 --> 00:13:26,135
Mr. Chu,

292
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:27,536
would you honor us

293
00:13:27,735 --> 00:13:28,615
with your presence?

294
00:13:29,296 --> 00:13:30,255
Since you asked,

295
00:13:30,775 --> 00:13:32,096
how could I say no?

296
00:13:43,176 --> 00:13:44,135
Why did you tell them

297
00:13:44,216 --> 00:13:45,336
that you can see now?

298
00:13:46,735 --> 00:13:48,015
I was helping you.

299
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:51,975
Helping me?

300
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:53,375
Yeah.

301
00:13:53,855 --> 00:13:55,536
To intimidate the Suns

302
00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:56,735
so that you can

303
00:13:56,895 --> 00:13:57,816
carry out your plan.

304
00:13:59,895 --> 00:14:00,576
I know

305
00:14:00,895 --> 00:14:02,176
you care about

306
00:14:02,224 --> 00:14:03,696
those victims.

307
00:14:04,255 --> 00:14:04,936
Therefore,

308
00:14:04,936 --> 00:14:06,296
I must help you

309
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:07,135
with the plan.

310
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,536
So you're not mad at me

311
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:11,440
because you know my plan?

312
00:14:15,096 --> 00:14:16,296
I, He Yan,

313
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,015
thank you on behalf

314
00:14:18,696 --> 00:14:19,895
of those victims.

315
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:46,171
(Tax Ledger)

316
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,816
So what if you meet them?

317
00:14:51,735 --> 00:14:53,296
I have dirt on these merchants.

318
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,336
They're under my control.

319
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,936
Let's see who dares

320
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:00,895
to speak against me in Yezhou.

321
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:08,576
Did you see how he opened

322
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:10,135
that cabinet?

323
00:15:11,056 --> 00:15:11,655
Yes, I did.

324
00:15:12,135 --> 00:15:12,855
Actually,

325
00:15:13,015 --> 00:15:14,456
we should thank Xiao Jue.

326
00:15:14,655 --> 00:15:16,096
He asked for that list

327
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,775
and gave us a chance.

328
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:19,975
Young Master.

329
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:22,296
Sun Ling's bedroom is guarded.

330
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:23,255
I could

331
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:24,855
sneak in unnoticed,

332
00:15:25,495 --> 00:15:27,135
but the noise of opening the cabinet

333
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:29,255
would surely alert the guards.

334
00:15:29,616 --> 00:15:30,255
Therefore,

335
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:31,895
to retrieve the ledgers,

336
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:32,895
we must draw

337
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,056
those guards away.

338
00:15:36,216 --> 00:15:38,096
Xiao Jue is staging a show tomorrow.

339
00:15:38,456 --> 00:15:39,655
Surely, he'll be prepared.

340
00:15:40,735 --> 00:15:42,416
Once his men subdue the guards,

341
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:44,615
that'll be your chance

342
00:15:44,696 --> 00:15:45,615
to get the ledgers.

343
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:49,336
Young Master.

344
00:15:49,775 --> 00:15:50,495
This is a trap.

345
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:52,576
Only Sun Xiangfu would believe

346
00:15:52,615 --> 00:15:53,576
that Xiao Jue genuinely

347
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:54,576
wanted to help him.

348
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,735
Why are you attending the feast?

349
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,655
When Xiao Jue takes action,

350
00:15:58,895 --> 00:16:00,056
Sun Xiangfu will try

351
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:01,775
to drag you down to save himself.

352
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:03,536
Would it stop him

353
00:16:04,135 --> 00:16:05,655
from implicating me if I don't go?

354
00:16:07,056 --> 00:16:08,096
So I must go.

355
00:16:08,495 --> 00:16:09,015
I am

356
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:10,336
the inspector.

357
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:11,895
No matter what happens,

358
00:16:12,456 --> 00:16:13,536
I can intervene.

359
00:16:14,855 --> 00:16:15,536
However,

360
00:16:16,615 --> 00:16:18,416
Sun Xiangfu must be taken out

361
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,216
to prevent complications.

362
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:21,576
If he exposes

363
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:22,775
his dealings with Master,

364
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:23,816
then it would

365
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:25,375
put me in trouble.

366
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:26,735
Rest assured.

367
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,416
I'll make sure

368
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,735
you face no future troubles.

369
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:51,015
Gentlemen,

370
00:16:51,735 --> 00:16:52,936
why aren't you eating?

371
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:56,056
The food is nice.

372
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,255
Why isn't anyone eating?

373
00:16:59,775 --> 00:17:00,336
Gentlemen.

374
00:17:00,615 --> 00:17:01,216
The rice

375
00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:02,816
comes from the hard work

376
00:17:03,176 --> 00:17:04,615
of the Yezhou people.

377
00:17:04,895 --> 00:17:05,576
These greens

378
00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:07,096
also come from

379
00:17:07,296 --> 00:17:08,615
their diligent labor.

380
00:17:09,056 --> 00:17:09,736
Gentlemen,

381
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,472
why aren't you eating?

382
00:17:25,736 --> 00:17:26,375
Huaijin.

383
00:17:26,816 --> 00:17:27,615
I think

384
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:30,096
these gentlemen might be

385
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,976
overwhelmed by the tax collection

386
00:17:32,296 --> 00:17:33,695
and couldn't eat.

387
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:37,576
Mr. Cheng is right.

388
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:39,496
Dig in.

389
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:40,536
Dig in.

390
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:54,375
You seriously have no appetite?

391
00:17:55,056 --> 00:17:56,976
I know things are hard for you,

392
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,215
but

393
00:17:59,415 --> 00:18:01,056
Commander Xiao doesn't.

394
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:02,415
You must

395
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:03,976
voice your concerns.

396
00:18:04,056 --> 00:18:05,655
Only then can he understand.

397
00:18:10,016 --> 00:18:11,215
Mr. Sun makes

398
00:18:12,256 --> 00:18:13,296
a fair point.

399
00:18:14,768 --> 00:18:15,816
Your wisdom prevails.

400
00:18:16,576 --> 00:18:17,175
Gentlemen,

401
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:18,928
don't hold back.

402
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:21,336
Tell me all about

403
00:18:22,096 --> 00:18:23,056
your troubles.

404
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:26,655
I...

405
00:18:38,352 --> 00:18:39,855
Everyone's too serious.

406
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:41,855
No one wishes to speak.

407
00:18:42,736 --> 00:18:43,536
Why don't we

408
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:45,016
go for a walk?

409
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,256
I happen to know

410
00:18:47,016 --> 00:18:47,655
a unique

411
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,776
scenic spot within the Sun Mansion.

412
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:51,296
Shall we

413
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,655
invite them to join us?

414
00:18:54,096 --> 00:18:55,536
Great idea.

415
00:19:06,655 --> 00:19:07,336
Gentlemen.

416
00:19:07,895 --> 00:19:09,576
Commander Xiao doesn't like to wait.

417
00:19:10,895 --> 00:19:11,536
Shall we?

418
00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:23,375
Shall we?

419
00:19:24,655 --> 00:19:25,215
Let's go.

420
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,615
Mr. Chu.

421
00:19:30,056 --> 00:19:31,895
- I...
- The great scenic spot

422
00:19:32,592 --> 00:19:33,424
is certainly

423
00:19:34,455 --> 00:19:35,496
not to be missed.

424
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:54,256
My sweetie.

425
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,215
My sweetie.

426
00:19:56,256 --> 00:19:57,336
My sweet girl.

427
00:19:57,336 --> 00:19:58,296
My child.

428
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:02,135
Who did this to you?

429
00:20:08,336 --> 00:20:09,215
Tell me, sweetie.

430
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:09,776
What...

431
00:20:11,256 --> 00:20:12,736
What's going on?

432
00:20:14,175 --> 00:20:14,976
What's going on?

433
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:17,256
You should ask Mr. Sun

434
00:20:17,736 --> 00:20:18,816
and Young Master Sun.

435
00:20:21,328 --> 00:20:21,935
Well...

436
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:22,655
Well...

437
00:20:23,016 --> 00:20:23,736
I...

438
00:20:23,895 --> 00:20:25,135
What's with the stuttering?

439
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,175
Calm down.

440
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:29,175
What does it have to do with us?

441
00:20:29,336 --> 00:20:30,336
Learn from me.

442
00:20:30,615 --> 00:20:31,496
Stay calm.

443
00:20:34,056 --> 00:20:35,135
None of our business.

444
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,655
Sun Xiangfu.

445
00:20:43,816 --> 00:20:44,375
My daughter.

446
00:20:44,528 --> 00:20:45,175
What?

447
00:20:45,336 --> 00:20:46,175
Why...

448
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:47,175
Why...

449
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,256
is my daughter
found dead in your mansion?

450
00:20:49,935 --> 00:20:52,375
Why is my daughter
found dead in your mansion?

451
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,736
How should I know?

452
00:20:54,576 --> 00:20:55,375
You should ask

453
00:20:55,415 --> 00:20:57,776
Commander Xiao and Mr. Cheng.

454
00:20:58,455 --> 00:20:59,496
Why did they bring us

455
00:20:59,496 --> 00:21:00,895
to this long-abandoned place?

456
00:21:01,016 --> 00:21:01,736
And why did they

457
00:21:01,776 --> 00:21:02,776
gather these corpses

458
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:03,776
to show us?

459
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:04,816
What do they want?

460
00:21:05,135 --> 00:21:06,056
What do we want?

461
00:21:07,536 --> 00:21:09,256
We're at your mansion.

462
00:21:09,976 --> 00:21:11,576
So the one who buried these remains

463
00:21:12,056 --> 00:21:13,424
must be from your household.

464
00:21:13,904 --> 00:21:15,016
Twelve bodies.

465
00:21:15,336 --> 00:21:15,895
That is

466
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:18,135
exactly the number of missing women.

467
00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:20,976
Sun Ling abducted innocent women,

468
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,215
violated them,

469
00:21:23,175 --> 00:21:24,935
brutally murdered them,

470
00:21:25,816 --> 00:21:27,215
and buried them here.

471
00:21:28,096 --> 00:21:29,056
And Sun Xiangfu

472
00:21:29,336 --> 00:21:30,455
abused his authority

473
00:21:31,175 --> 00:21:32,296
to cover up

474
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,215
the heinous crimes.

475
00:21:35,056 --> 00:21:36,455
They should be executed.

476
00:21:38,695 --> 00:21:39,695
Commander, Mr. Cheng.

477
00:21:40,056 --> 00:21:41,375
Do you have evidence?

478
00:21:41,695 --> 00:21:43,096
You can't just make

479
00:21:43,256 --> 00:21:44,256
false accusations

480
00:21:44,496 --> 00:21:45,576
against us as you wish.

481
00:21:45,776 --> 00:21:46,336
Exactly.

482
00:21:47,895 --> 00:21:48,536
Mr. Chu,

483
00:21:49,695 --> 00:21:51,336
as a minister sent from the capital,

484
00:21:51,655 --> 00:21:53,135
you can tell right from wrong.

485
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:55,615
Commander Xiao

486
00:21:55,655 --> 00:21:56,215
and Mr. Cheng

487
00:21:56,455 --> 00:21:57,135
are clearly

488
00:21:57,135 --> 00:21:58,296
holding grudges against me

489
00:21:58,415 --> 00:21:59,816
due to the provisions and funds.

490
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:01,536
So they are

491
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,175
blaming the murders on us.

492
00:22:03,175 --> 00:22:03,615
Exactly.

493
00:22:04,655 --> 00:22:05,375
Mr. Chu,

494
00:22:06,736 --> 00:22:07,415
you also think

495
00:22:08,215 --> 00:22:09,215
that I'm framing them?

496
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,736
Of course, I trust you

497
00:22:13,056 --> 00:22:14,056
and Mr. Cheng.

498
00:22:14,576 --> 00:22:15,215
But

499
00:22:15,695 --> 00:22:16,615
these bodies alone

500
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:17,895
don't prove anything.

501
00:22:18,816 --> 00:22:19,496
We need

502
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,455
solid evidence.

503
00:22:21,655 --> 00:22:22,336
Exactly.

504
00:22:22,736 --> 00:22:24,455
Evidence is crucial.

505
00:22:24,655 --> 00:22:26,736
Mr. Chu proves to be a wise man.

506
00:22:26,895 --> 00:22:27,776
You heard Mr. Chu?

507
00:22:27,895 --> 00:22:29,415
We need solid proof.

508
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:30,496
Where is

509
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:31,536
the evidence...?

510
00:22:31,576 --> 00:22:32,455
I am the evidence.

511
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:39,215
Who is she?

512
00:22:39,296 --> 00:22:39,816
No idea.

513
00:22:42,215 --> 00:22:43,016
Who is she?

514
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:44,536
No idea.

515
00:22:59,215 --> 00:23:00,736
I am the daughter of the Chief

516
00:23:00,736 --> 00:23:01,615
Imperial Physician,

517
00:23:01,736 --> 00:23:02,536
Song Taotao.

518
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,215
I was abducted by Sun Ling

519
00:23:04,432 --> 00:23:06,016
the moment I arrived in Yezhou.

520
00:23:06,256 --> 00:23:07,096
Everyone

521
00:23:07,415 --> 00:23:08,655
at the inn that day

522
00:23:08,736 --> 00:23:09,655
can testify to that.

523
00:23:10,215 --> 00:23:12,215
Had Mr. Cheng not intervened,

524
00:23:12,776 --> 00:23:13,576
I would be

525
00:23:13,655 --> 00:23:14,736
the thirteenth corpse.

526
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,256
Father.

527
00:23:17,816 --> 00:23:18,496
Shut up.

528
00:23:22,032 --> 00:23:23,215
That's not true, Mr. Chu.

529
00:23:25,135 --> 00:23:26,375
Commander Xiao, Mr. Cheng.

530
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,455
I know

531
00:23:27,496 --> 00:23:30,256
my son has offended Miss Song.

532
00:23:30,704 --> 00:23:32,256
But you can't make up something

533
00:23:32,415 --> 00:23:33,215
to frame my son

534
00:23:33,215 --> 00:23:34,375
just because of that.

535
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,016
Yeah.

536
00:23:35,096 --> 00:23:36,135
You...

537
00:23:36,175 --> 00:23:37,296
You brat!

538
00:23:37,536 --> 00:23:38,576
It's all your fault.

539
00:23:38,816 --> 00:23:39,336
I...

540
00:23:39,496 --> 00:23:41,296
See? They're seeking revenge on us.

541
00:23:41,935 --> 00:23:43,256
They're attacking us now.

542
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:44,855
They're slandering us.

543
00:23:44,855 --> 00:23:46,016
They're even

544
00:23:46,336 --> 00:23:48,695
trying to get us killed.

545
00:23:48,855 --> 00:23:50,695
Father, you're absolutely right.

546
00:23:50,768 --> 00:23:52,736
We're innocent.

547
00:23:56,976 --> 00:23:57,744
You're innocent?

548
00:23:59,816 --> 00:24:01,455
Then what's the story

549
00:24:03,016 --> 00:24:04,336
with these 12 deities?

550
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:07,776
These 12 statues

551
00:24:08,496 --> 00:24:10,016
suppress 12 vengeful spirits.

552
00:24:10,776 --> 00:24:12,336
You committed evil deeds,

553
00:24:12,855 --> 00:24:13,855
and expect the deities

554
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:14,776
to suppress the souls

555
00:24:14,855 --> 00:24:16,215
of these poor women.

556
00:24:17,016 --> 00:24:17,855
What a pair

557
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:19,496
of "virtuous" father and son.

558
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:21,215
Justice will prevail.

559
00:24:21,615 --> 00:24:22,296
The deities

560
00:24:22,496 --> 00:24:23,336
would never help

561
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:24,296
villains like you.

562
00:24:24,736 --> 00:24:25,296
Mr. Cheng,

563
00:24:25,336 --> 00:24:26,615
you're crossing the line.

564
00:24:26,864 --> 00:24:27,455
Yeah.

565
00:24:27,576 --> 00:24:28,895
Who knows what's going on

566
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:29,695
with the statues?

567
00:24:29,816 --> 00:24:31,096
It could be a coincidence.

568
00:24:31,655 --> 00:24:32,415
Besides,

569
00:24:33,016 --> 00:24:33,816
maybe...

570
00:24:34,215 --> 00:24:36,536
the person who planted the corpses here

571
00:24:36,816 --> 00:24:37,455
did this

572
00:24:37,536 --> 00:24:38,175
to frame us.

573
00:24:38,256 --> 00:24:39,135
It's very likely.

574
00:24:39,175 --> 00:24:39,895
Yeah.

575
00:24:40,695 --> 00:24:42,016
To frame you?

576
00:24:43,296 --> 00:24:44,455
These 12 statues

577
00:24:44,935 --> 00:24:45,855
vary in age.

578
00:24:46,935 --> 00:24:47,736
Why don't we

579
00:24:48,056 --> 00:24:49,816
ask the craftsmen

580
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:51,296
who made them

581
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:52,776
when each statue

582
00:24:53,096 --> 00:24:54,135
was made,

583
00:24:54,655 --> 00:24:55,256
and compare

584
00:24:55,256 --> 00:24:56,536
the dates with the time

585
00:24:57,056 --> 00:24:58,135
these women died?

586
00:24:58,448 --> 00:24:59,096
Yeah.

587
00:25:00,576 --> 00:25:02,016
N-No need.

588
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:03,336
Father, this isn't...

589
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,336
Sun Xiangfu.

590
00:25:05,736 --> 00:25:06,496
So it was

591
00:25:06,895 --> 00:25:08,496
you corrupt official

592
00:25:08,615 --> 00:25:10,895
and your son who killed my daughter.

593
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:12,536
I wondered

594
00:25:12,855 --> 00:25:15,056
why the case dragged on.

595
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:16,375
Give me back

596
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:17,415
my daughter!

597
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:18,032
You filth!

598
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:19,496
Give her back to me!

599
00:25:20,175 --> 00:25:21,016
Rest assured.

600
00:25:23,336 --> 00:25:24,016
Commander Xiao

601
00:25:24,576 --> 00:25:26,296
will surely obtain justice

602
00:25:27,016 --> 00:25:28,736
for your daughters

603
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:30,576
and all other victims.

604
00:25:33,016 --> 00:25:34,096
Commander Xiao,

605
00:25:34,175 --> 00:25:36,736
you must uphold justice for us.

606
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:37,695
Everyone,

607
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:39,336
please rise.

608
00:25:40,615 --> 00:25:42,576
I will ensure justice is served.

609
00:25:52,976 --> 00:25:53,536
Why is there

610
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:55,056
also a male corpse?

611
00:25:57,375 --> 00:25:58,736
A-A male corpse?

612
00:26:05,808 --> 00:26:06,695
Isn't he

613
00:26:07,496 --> 00:26:08,776
the servant from

614
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:09,855
the Sun's Mansion?

615
00:26:09,855 --> 00:26:10,736
No, I didn't...

616
00:26:15,776 --> 00:26:16,816
He's one of theirs.

617
00:26:16,855 --> 00:26:17,424
Yeah.

618
00:26:17,496 --> 00:26:18,256
I recall seeing him

619
00:26:18,855 --> 00:26:20,175
at Wanhua Pavilion

620
00:26:20,736 --> 00:26:22,056
when I first arrived in Yezhou.

621
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,455
He was selecting dancers

622
00:26:23,536 --> 00:26:24,296
for the banquet

623
00:26:24,615 --> 00:26:25,855
following

624
00:26:26,256 --> 00:26:27,296
Mr. Sun's orders.

625
00:26:27,536 --> 00:26:28,776
He ended up selecting

626
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:30,695
a bunch of assassins

627
00:26:30,816 --> 00:26:31,776
who tried to kill me.

628
00:26:32,615 --> 00:26:33,296
Could it be

629
00:26:33,855 --> 00:26:35,375
a part of Mr. Sun's order?

630
00:26:41,455 --> 00:26:43,256
What a gruesome way to die.

631
00:26:44,855 --> 00:26:46,175
He's just another pawn.

632
00:26:46,776 --> 00:26:47,736
I wonder

633
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:50,976
what fate awaits

634
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:51,935
Mr. Sun?

635
00:26:52,895 --> 00:26:54,175
He deserves to die.

636
00:26:58,175 --> 00:26:58,855
Well.

637
00:26:59,655 --> 00:27:00,576
Alright.

638
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,375
I'll show you what fate awaits me.

639
00:27:04,855 --> 00:27:05,935
Just a minute.

640
00:27:10,455 --> 00:27:11,615
W-What is he doing?

641
00:27:11,695 --> 00:27:13,056
You'll find out what fate

642
00:27:13,135 --> 00:27:14,256
awaits me right now!

643
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:15,375
Watch closely.

644
00:27:35,664 --> 00:27:37,832
(Account Book)

645
00:28:13,855 --> 00:28:14,496
Try again.

646
00:28:20,176 --> 00:28:21,215
They're here.

647
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:22,135
What should we do?

648
00:28:22,296 --> 00:28:23,175
Yeah.

649
00:28:28,336 --> 00:28:28,855
Commander.

650
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,855
The guards trying to barge in

651
00:28:31,455 --> 00:28:32,455
have been subdued.

652
00:28:32,895 --> 00:28:33,776
Awaiting your command.

653
00:28:34,655 --> 00:28:35,336
Detain them.

654
00:28:36,336 --> 00:28:36,855
Understood.

655
00:28:40,688 --> 00:28:41,935
Did you find provisions

656
00:28:43,135 --> 00:28:43,855
and funds?

657
00:28:43,952 --> 00:28:44,695
No.

658
00:28:45,096 --> 00:28:46,336
The warehouse is empty.

659
00:28:51,655 --> 00:28:52,536
Mr. Sun,

660
00:28:54,296 --> 00:28:55,215
since the merchants

661
00:28:55,455 --> 00:28:56,536
have paid their taxes,

662
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,455
then where are the funds

663
00:29:00,056 --> 00:29:01,256
and provisions

664
00:29:02,128 --> 00:29:03,135
that you have raised?

665
00:29:03,296 --> 00:29:03,976
Indeed.

666
00:29:04,135 --> 00:29:04,695
Where?

667
00:29:04,695 --> 00:29:05,655
Everything's gone.

668
00:29:05,695 --> 00:29:07,096
The provisions and funds...

669
00:29:07,336 --> 00:29:08,056
Sun Xiangfu.

670
00:29:08,336 --> 00:29:09,135
At this point,

671
00:29:09,976 --> 00:29:11,455
you still won't tell the truth?

672
00:29:20,496 --> 00:29:21,296
Father.

673
00:29:22,736 --> 00:29:23,336
Father.

674
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:40,695
Commander Xiao.

675
00:29:43,088 --> 00:29:45,215
I know what you want.

676
00:29:46,415 --> 00:29:47,895
Spare my son and me,

677
00:29:48,816 --> 00:29:50,256
and I'll tell you who...

678
00:29:51,855 --> 00:29:52,855
Assassins. Get them.

679
00:29:53,104 --> 00:29:53,935
Father!

680
00:29:54,224 --> 00:29:55,175
Father.

681
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:57,576
Father!

682
00:29:58,695 --> 00:30:00,296
What should I do, Father?

683
00:30:02,536 --> 00:30:03,695
It's over.

684
00:30:03,895 --> 00:30:04,855
It's over.

685
00:30:05,536 --> 00:30:06,455
Father.

686
00:30:08,096 --> 00:30:09,016
Father.

687
00:30:10,615 --> 00:30:13,056
(What a great disciple of Xu Jingfu.)

688
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:22,096
You've brought justice

689
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,536
to those women.

690
00:30:24,296 --> 00:30:26,695
Had you not made plans to expose

691
00:30:27,215 --> 00:30:28,375
the Suns' crime

692
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,776
against women,

693
00:30:30,736 --> 00:30:31,695
I wouldn't have been

694
00:30:32,536 --> 00:30:33,776
of much help.

695
00:30:35,175 --> 00:30:35,895
Mr. Feinu.

696
00:30:36,575 --> 00:30:38,175
The Commander will invite the merchants.

697
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:39,375
We noticed

698
00:30:39,695 --> 00:30:41,256
that some of the victims

699
00:30:41,615 --> 00:30:43,175
had luxurious attire.

700
00:30:43,536 --> 00:30:45,415
They must be from wealthy families.

701
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:47,096
Recently, we learned

702
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,056
that in the city,

703
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:49,895
some merchants lost their daughters.

704
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:51,375
I bet there is a connection

705
00:30:52,336 --> 00:30:53,415
between these matters.

706
00:30:57,415 --> 00:30:58,976
Those women would thank you.

707
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:03,736
They would thank you, too.

708
00:31:07,455 --> 00:31:08,655
You did well

709
00:31:09,016 --> 00:31:10,175
by killing Sun Xiangfu.

710
00:31:10,776 --> 00:31:11,695
It's my job

711
00:31:11,855 --> 00:31:12,976
to share your burden.

712
00:31:14,056 --> 00:31:15,415
(Account Book)
This is a double-edged sword.

713
00:31:15,976 --> 00:31:17,056
Either perish

714
00:31:17,256 --> 00:31:18,375
or prosper.

715
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:19,375
It depends on

716
00:31:20,215 --> 00:31:20,855
how we wield it.

717
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:22,816
Young Master.

718
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,175
Xiao Jue's man saw me

719
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:25,455
retrieving the ledger.

720
00:31:26,224 --> 00:31:27,296
I'm worried...

721
00:31:27,655 --> 00:31:28,816
Don't worry.

722
00:31:29,415 --> 00:31:30,536
The Chancellor is my master.

723
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,816
Xiao Jue is definitely suspecting me.

724
00:31:33,615 --> 00:31:34,256
But

725
00:31:34,415 --> 00:31:35,175
what can he do

726
00:31:35,576 --> 00:31:36,496
without evidence?

727
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:38,375
Commander.

728
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,695
I followed a suspicious

729
00:31:39,695 --> 00:31:40,455
masked person

730
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:41,415
all the way to

731
00:31:41,496 --> 00:31:42,296
Sun Ling's study.

732
00:31:43,215 --> 00:31:44,256
That person

733
00:31:44,296 --> 00:31:45,175
retrieved an item

734
00:31:45,496 --> 00:31:46,536
from a hidden compartment.

735
00:31:47,536 --> 00:31:49,016
I tried to recover it,

736
00:31:49,872 --> 00:31:51,016
but fell for a trick.

737
00:31:52,736 --> 00:31:53,736
Someone took advantage

738
00:31:54,576 --> 00:31:56,256
of the chaos to reap the benefits.

739
00:31:57,135 --> 00:31:58,455
So well-planned.

740
00:31:59,415 --> 00:32:01,135
Sun Xiangfu guarded that item

741
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,135
so well.

742
00:32:02,776 --> 00:32:04,615
It must be related to Xu Jingfu.

743
00:32:05,336 --> 00:32:05,976
Who else

744
00:32:05,976 --> 00:32:06,895
besides me

745
00:32:07,455 --> 00:32:08,016
would care

746
00:32:08,056 --> 00:32:09,496
so much about Xu Jingfu?

747
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:11,935
Chu Zhao?

748
00:32:13,576 --> 00:32:14,215
That's right.

749
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:18,736
But we lack evidence.

750
00:32:21,935 --> 00:32:23,016
The military funds

751
00:32:23,016 --> 00:32:24,135
and provisions

752
00:32:25,135 --> 00:32:26,375
have likely ended up

753
00:32:26,455 --> 00:32:27,695
in Xu Jingfu's pockets.

754
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:28,895
Commander.

755
00:32:29,336 --> 00:32:30,695
Are we really letting this go?

756
00:32:31,175 --> 00:32:32,056
What will the soldiers

757
00:32:32,096 --> 00:32:32,935
eat then?

758
00:32:35,855 --> 00:32:37,536
I'll settle this debt eventually.

759
00:32:39,776 --> 00:32:40,695
But for now,

760
00:32:41,455 --> 00:32:42,736
we need another solution.

761
00:32:47,415 --> 00:32:48,215
Have the remains

762
00:32:49,215 --> 00:32:50,695
been claimed by families?

763
00:32:52,655 --> 00:32:53,816
Three are unclaimed.

764
00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:54,855
They came from

765
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:56,256
unknown origins.

766
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:57,256
No names.

767
00:32:57,855 --> 00:32:58,695
No records.

768
00:33:00,655 --> 00:33:02,536
Then let them rest in peace.

769
00:33:06,976 --> 00:33:09,175
(Outside Yezhou, there's a platform)

770
00:33:10,016 --> 00:33:11,175
(named Chengfeng.)

771
00:33:13,215 --> 00:33:14,496
(Bury them there.)

772
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:17,655
(Roam freely with the wind)
(May they roam freely)

773
00:33:18,895 --> 00:33:20,056
(with the wind.)

774
00:33:21,415 --> 00:33:22,496
As the saying goes,

775
00:33:23,576 --> 00:33:25,375
women are praised for their gentleness.

776
00:33:26,615 --> 00:33:28,016
But gentleness implies weakness.

777
00:33:28,895 --> 00:33:29,776
We can't even

778
00:33:29,816 --> 00:33:31,016
protect ourselves out there.

779
00:33:33,215 --> 00:33:34,736
This isn't about gender.

780
00:33:35,816 --> 00:33:36,695
Everyone

781
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,056
grows from a fragile infant

782
00:33:39,056 --> 00:33:39,855
to be an adult.

783
00:33:40,776 --> 00:33:41,816
If you hate being weak,

784
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:43,415
you can train

785
00:33:43,415 --> 00:33:44,296
like men do.

786
00:33:45,336 --> 00:33:46,096
Although

787
00:33:46,695 --> 00:33:47,695
it's harder

788
00:33:48,256 --> 00:33:49,536
for women,

789
00:33:50,455 --> 00:33:51,855
better to learn than not.

790
00:33:52,536 --> 00:33:53,096
You might

791
00:33:53,576 --> 00:33:54,736
even become a female general.

792
00:33:55,296 --> 00:33:56,016
Men

793
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:57,695
should protect women

794
00:33:58,256 --> 00:33:59,695
and shelter them

795
00:34:00,135 --> 00:34:00,895
forever.

796
00:34:03,536 --> 00:34:04,455
I don't believe

797
00:34:05,296 --> 00:34:07,135
women should entrust

798
00:34:07,615 --> 00:34:09,056
their lives to men.

799
00:34:09,816 --> 00:34:10,816
Instead of being

800
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,056
a caged bird,

801
00:34:12,655 --> 00:34:14,016
it's better to grow wings.

802
00:34:15,456 --> 00:34:16,335
That's what

803
00:34:16,775 --> 00:34:18,215
the Commander engraved on the steel.

804
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:21,576
Roam freely

805
00:34:22,295 --> 00:34:23,416
with the wind.

806
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:40,096
Zilan, don't cry.

807
00:34:41,896 --> 00:34:43,976
(Chu Mingfang, Chu Zhao's mother)
I'm just tired.

808
00:34:44,735 --> 00:34:45,936
If we have a next life,

809
00:34:46,016 --> 00:34:47,655
I'd still choose to be a woman

810
00:34:47,695 --> 00:34:48,815
and your mother.

811
00:34:50,768 --> 00:34:53,135
I'll strengthen my wings

812
00:34:53,456 --> 00:34:55,096
to protect you better.

813
00:35:02,856 --> 00:35:04,416
(If only someone had offered)

814
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:05,896
(my mother justice)

815
00:35:07,976 --> 00:35:08,896
(back then.)

816
00:35:11,056 --> 00:35:12,516
(Sun Mansion)

817
00:35:13,175 --> 00:35:14,335
Hurry. My lord.

818
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:15,215
My lord.

819
00:35:15,856 --> 00:35:17,416
- My lord.
- My lord.

820
00:35:17,775 --> 00:35:19,135
- Thank you, my lord.
- Thank you, my lord.

821
00:35:19,255 --> 00:35:20,056
Watch out.

822
00:35:20,255 --> 00:35:21,135
It's fine.

823
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,695
They're here for you, Commander Xiao.

824
00:35:24,056 --> 00:35:24,655
Not really.

825
00:35:25,335 --> 00:35:26,615
You contributed greatly, too.

826
00:35:27,056 --> 00:35:28,135
Thank you, my lords,

827
00:35:28,255 --> 00:35:29,775
for punishing the corrupt officials.

828
00:35:30,016 --> 00:35:30,655
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

829
00:35:30,775 --> 00:35:31,295
Thank you.

830
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:32,416
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

831
00:35:32,576 --> 00:35:33,496
Take these.

832
00:35:33,695 --> 00:35:34,615
We appreciate it.

833
00:35:34,735 --> 00:35:35,335
Huaijin.

834
00:35:35,695 --> 00:35:36,695
Are you overwhelmed

835
00:35:37,016 --> 00:35:38,295
by their enthusiasm?

836
00:35:39,016 --> 00:35:40,056
Do you need my help?

837
00:35:40,576 --> 00:35:41,615
How will you help?

838
00:35:43,295 --> 00:35:44,335
I'll simply

839
00:35:45,335 --> 00:35:46,576
cover his eyes

840
00:35:46,815 --> 00:35:47,815
so that he can't see.

841
00:35:50,016 --> 00:35:51,295
The folks mean well.

842
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:53,376
Commander Xiao shouldn't storm off,

843
00:35:53,896 --> 00:35:54,896
right?

844
00:35:55,472 --> 00:35:56,056
Yeah.

845
00:35:56,056 --> 00:35:56,655
Yeah.

846
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:57,456
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

847
00:35:57,735 --> 00:35:58,695
- Take them.
- Take them.

848
00:35:58,856 --> 00:35:59,735
- Take them.
- Take them.

849
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:01,215
Yeah, Huaijin.

850
00:36:01,536 --> 00:36:02,056
You see?

851
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:03,376
They're so enthusiastic.

852
00:36:03,775 --> 00:36:05,456
If you keep wearing that icy expression,

853
00:36:05,615 --> 00:36:06,815
it'll make you look heartless.

854
00:36:07,856 --> 00:36:08,416
Like this.

855
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:14,576
What nonsense.

856
00:36:17,735 --> 00:36:18,496
Commander Xiao.

857
00:36:18,815 --> 00:36:19,856
I will never forget

858
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:21,175
your kindness.

859
00:36:22,175 --> 00:36:23,056
Without you,

860
00:36:23,496 --> 00:36:24,695
my daughter would never...

861
00:36:26,896 --> 00:36:27,615
Never mind.

862
00:36:27,824 --> 00:36:28,655
Forget it.

863
00:36:29,376 --> 00:36:30,016
Commander Xiao.

864
00:36:30,335 --> 00:36:31,056
We know you came

865
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:32,655
to secure provisions and funds

866
00:36:32,655 --> 00:36:33,976
for the Yezhou Garrison.

867
00:36:34,295 --> 00:36:35,295
So we collected

868
00:36:35,416 --> 00:36:36,175
money and grains

869
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:38,335
from all the merchants

870
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,856
as your provisions and funds.

871
00:36:41,295 --> 00:36:42,695
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

872
00:36:42,695 --> 00:36:43,376
Yeah, Commander.

873
00:36:43,376 --> 00:36:44,175
Please accept them.

874
00:36:44,255 --> 00:36:45,335
Take these.

875
00:36:45,456 --> 00:36:46,335
Take these.

876
00:36:46,856 --> 00:36:49,215
I'm such a lucky charm.

877
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,016
A talent like me deserves

878
00:36:51,456 --> 00:36:53,056
to join the Nine Banners Battalion.

879
00:36:55,376 --> 00:36:56,456
Allow me to thank you

880
00:36:57,335 --> 00:36:59,135
on behalf of Yezhou Garrison.

881
00:37:00,056 --> 00:37:00,976
Our pleasure.

882
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,655
- Our pleasure.
- Our pleasure.

883
00:37:01,695 --> 00:37:02,215
Take these.

884
00:37:02,215 --> 00:37:02,936
Let's note down

885
00:37:02,936 --> 00:37:03,815
your contributions.

886
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:04,896
Alright.

887
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,096
- Alright.
- Alright!

888
00:37:06,215 --> 00:37:07,815
- Go.
- Let's go.

889
00:37:13,655 --> 00:37:14,335
Commander Xiao.

890
00:37:14,496 --> 00:37:15,096
Mr. Cheng.

891
00:37:15,536 --> 00:37:16,735
I'm returning soon.

892
00:37:17,856 --> 00:37:18,896
I'll report this case

893
00:37:19,088 --> 00:37:20,295
to the court.

894
00:37:20,775 --> 00:37:21,536
We'll meet again

895
00:37:21,896 --> 00:37:22,695
if fate permits.

896
00:37:25,296 --> 00:37:26,496
Mr. Chu, I wish you

897
00:37:26,856 --> 00:37:27,655
a smooth journey.

898
00:37:27,696 --> 00:37:28,536
Thank you.

899
00:37:29,215 --> 00:37:29,856
Mr. Cheng.

900
00:37:30,376 --> 00:37:31,056
Actually,

901
00:37:31,295 --> 00:37:32,335
we've met several times.

902
00:37:32,615 --> 00:37:33,615
This is fate.

903
00:37:34,096 --> 00:37:34,815
But

904
00:37:35,335 --> 00:37:36,815
I still don't know your proper name.

905
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:38,215
Unless you are

906
00:37:38,496 --> 00:37:39,936
truly Commander Xiao's nephew,

907
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:41,135
Cheng Lisu?

908
00:37:43,735 --> 00:37:44,496
I am He Yan.

909
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:45,976
"He" for seedling,

910
00:37:46,576 --> 00:37:47,936
and "Yan" for peace.

911
00:37:48,752 --> 00:37:49,615
Thank you

912
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,615
for keeping my secret earlier, Mr. Chu.

913
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,976
My pleasure.

914
00:37:57,856 --> 00:37:59,056
Mr. He, your sword dance

915
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:00,335
was truly peerless.

916
00:38:01,775 --> 00:38:02,456
You resemble

917
00:38:03,295 --> 00:38:04,456
a celestial from legends.

918
00:38:09,615 --> 00:38:10,255
Rest assured.

919
00:38:10,815 --> 00:38:11,536
I will

920
00:38:12,096 --> 00:38:13,735
keep this a secret, too.

921
00:38:16,368 --> 00:38:17,615
Won't you pack?

922
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:19,255
Aren't we going back?

923
00:38:19,815 --> 00:38:20,335
We are.

924
00:38:20,695 --> 00:38:21,536
Of course, we are.

925
00:38:44,752 --> 00:38:45,416
Huaijin.

926
00:38:45,695 --> 00:38:46,175
Mr. He.

927
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:47,815
You finally returned.

928
00:38:48,655 --> 00:38:49,335
I never expected

929
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,496
that the Suns

930
00:38:50,544 --> 00:38:52,295
were beasts in human disguise.

931
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,416
But it's not bad.

932
00:38:53,615 --> 00:38:55,056
With such unreliable matchmakers,

933
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:56,016
my parents

934
00:38:56,096 --> 00:38:57,215
won't force me to marry

935
00:38:57,295 --> 00:38:58,335
that venomous woman.

936
00:38:58,695 --> 00:38:59,896
Cheng Lisu!

937
00:39:01,976 --> 00:39:02,775
V-Venomous...

938
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,016
Venomous woman!

939
00:39:05,104 --> 00:39:06,016
What did you call me?

940
00:39:06,768 --> 00:39:07,416
Mr. He.

941
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:08,576
Catch up later.

942
00:39:08,976 --> 00:39:10,255
You can just tell me to leave.

943
00:39:10,335 --> 00:39:11,215
Why bring this

944
00:39:11,376 --> 00:39:12,016
venomous woman?

945
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:12,896
Cheng Lisu.

946
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,615
Prepare to die!

947
00:39:13,615 --> 00:39:14,416
N-No!

948
00:39:15,096 --> 00:39:15,735
Commander.

949
00:39:15,952 --> 00:39:17,335
What are they...?

950
00:39:17,775 --> 00:39:19,295
Cheng Lisu could be having a stroke.

951
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:20,656
He needs treatment.

952
00:39:23,376 --> 00:39:24,735
Miss Song usually looks

953
00:39:24,775 --> 00:39:25,655
gentle and quiet.

954
00:39:25,695 --> 00:39:26,856
But she's so fierce.

955
00:39:29,175 --> 00:39:30,615
Only you would think that.

956
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:32,735
What do you mean?

957
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:35,096
I thought you were a "talent".

958
00:39:35,896 --> 00:39:36,695
Use your brain.

959
00:39:40,176 --> 00:39:41,175
For what?

960
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:55,175
Poison first.

961
00:39:55,615 --> 00:39:56,615
Then assassination.

962
00:39:58,096 --> 00:39:58,815
He Rufei

963
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:00,096
hasn't changed a bit.

964
00:40:02,735 --> 00:40:04,695
But why did he attempt to

965
00:40:05,056 --> 00:40:06,016
kill Xiao Jue?

966
00:40:08,056 --> 00:40:09,536
Do they hold

967
00:40:10,896 --> 00:40:11,615
any grudges

968
00:40:11,615 --> 00:40:13,056
that I am unaware of?
