22

=Episode 34=

23
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:45,860
Under war's shadow,

24
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,979
people always suffer most.

25
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:50,539
If peace reigns,

26
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:53,179
I'd gladly retire.

27
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:57,099
But I intend to be a great general.

28
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,580
How about this?

29
00:01:58,899 --> 00:01:59,700
I'll support you.

30
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:02,739
Thank you, General Feihong.

31
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,979
Li Kuang returns to Rundu today.

32
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,420
It should be about time now.

33
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:10,339
I'll see him off.

34
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,980
Don't you want me to go?

35
00:02:12,619 --> 00:02:13,459
Better not.

36
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,540
Li Kuang got startled

37
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:16,700
by Mr. Cheng's

38
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,420
grand display.

39
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,219
If not for me,

40
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:21,020
he'd be long gone.

41
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:37,928
Send the betrothal certificate?

42
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:38,952
Give it to me.

43
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:44,659
Cheng Lisu, hey you!

44
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,179
You have

45
00:02:46,179 --> 00:02:46,820
peanut allergy!

46
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:48,459
Why eat peanut cakes?

47
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,380
Taotao, I...

48
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,300
You remembered my peanut allergy?

49
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,619
Is this really the time for that?

50
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,380
How much you ate?

51
00:02:57,939 --> 00:02:59,219
I'd rather check your pulse.

52
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:04,980
Your pulse is steady.

53
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,860
You lie to me?

54
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,459
Taotao, I don't.

55
00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:09,980
You care about me too much.

56
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,459
Yes. I care about you and fall for you.

57
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,140
So what?

58
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,100
Give me the thing.

59
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,700
Why stand up?

60
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,260
Song Taotao, I want to marry you.

61
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:27,420
I love you.

62
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,300
I, Cheng Lisu, have

63
00:03:36,779 --> 00:03:37,459
fallen for you,

64
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:38,899
wishing to marry you.

65
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,700
To tie the nuptial knot

66
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,899
and travel together,

67
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,860
writing books and tasting herbs.

68
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,700
I'll only marry you.

69
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,540
What do you think?

70
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:54,459
I don't want

71
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:55,580
to tie the nuptial knot.

72
00:03:59,179 --> 00:04:00,339
I'll be lovebirds with you,

73
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,380
so we can travel around.

74
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:05,779
Right, lovebirds.

75
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:16,459
Albizia flowers?

76
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,779
They calm the mind and the nerve,

77
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,820
symbolizing marital bliss.

78
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,260
Taotao,

79
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,620
together with you,

80
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,219
I seek no dramatic love.

81
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:49,219
I only want peace and joy

82
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:50,500
with you.

83
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,060
It's the wedding invitation

84
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,020
of the Chengs and Songs.

85
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,659
Lisu and Taotao will

86
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,859
marry this month's end.

87
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:11,060
So fast?

88
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:12,299
Their families

89
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:13,380
have done almost

90
00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:14,659
everything of betrothal.

91
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:15,779
Naturally it is fast.

92
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:18,979
Finally,

93
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,740
they could be together.

94
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,020
Yes, they are.

95
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,539
Then when will you

96
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,299
and Miss He end up together?

97
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,419
This loquat tree is still here?

98
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,380
So short.

99
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:07,380
Huaijin.

100
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,180
Must you show off

101
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,140
in front of me,

102
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:11,820
and then mock my height?

103
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,140
Back then,

104
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:18,260
you were so cold.

105
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,380
But I'm lucky.

106
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,620
I remember once

107
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,520
when I failed an exam,

108
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:23,820
I was locked in a dark room.

109
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,140
(I was starving at the time.)

110
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,020
(And then)

111
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:28,859
(someone secretly gave me loquats.)

112
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:46,979
I really like

113
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,940
such a kind soul.

114
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,859
You like him

115
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:52,940
over some loquats?

116
00:06:57,859 --> 00:06:58,820
It's me who gave you

117
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,820
those loquats.

118
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,539
So it was you, Huaijin.

119
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:10,380
I knew it.

120
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,500
You're the only one

121
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,339
I've ever been so in sync with.

122
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,380
You're truly a lifesaver.

123
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,060
Look at you.

124
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,419
How could you be last again?

125
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,700
Master Wei.

126
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,620
You taught us self-sacrifice.

127
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,779
If I don't endure hardship, who will?

128
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:28,552
You!

129
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:31,140
Hopeless.

130
00:07:32,764 --> 00:07:35,208
(Xianchang Academy)

131
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,299
What?

132
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:41,419
Can't you face me properly?

133
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,459
Xiao Jue.

134
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,380
You are my most proud student.

135
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:50,060
Why did you...?

136
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:51,659
Why did he end up liking me?

137
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:54,740
A woman

138
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,779
disguised as a man

139
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:57,859
and studied here.

140
00:07:58,459 --> 00:07:59,380
That was outrageous.

141
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,979
You even went

142
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:03,020
to join the military.

143
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,779
How absurd!

144
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,940
How immoral!

145
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:08,940
How rude!

146
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:12,060
Xiao Jue has always
maintained good conduct.

147
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:13,260
It must be you

148
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,820
who lured him astray.

149
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,219
- Master Wei.
- Master...

150
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:19,099
I fell for her first.

151
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,020
She is Wei's

152
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,099
first female general.

153
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:23,219
Frankly speaking,

154
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,620
I'm the lucky one.

155
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,620
You're a grown man.

156
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:29,060
Don't always talk

157
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:30,180
about love.

158
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:33,299
Beauty brings disaster.

159
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:34,419
So they are

160
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,740
General Feihong and Fengyun?

161
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,460
Yes!

162
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,380
I'll be a general too!

163
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,260
- Me too!
- I'll be a general!

164
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,020
Stop it!

165
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,699
Don't mess around.

166
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,899
Return to your studies!

167
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,059
- Yes.
- Yes.

168
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,899
He's a walking contradiction.

169
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,939
When he heard General Feihong

170
00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:49,860
was a woman,

171
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:50,939
he angrily removed

172
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:51,579
the calligraphy

173
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:52,980
she left during her studies.

174
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,899
But then he still

175
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,140
hung it back up.

176
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:10,340
Huaijin.

177
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:11,500
Did you

178
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:13,140
take me here on purpose?

179
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:15,980
You're no longer

180
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,500
the problem student,

181
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,500
but the Xianchang Academy's pride.

182
00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:23,419
However,

183
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:24,980
General Feihong,

184
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,059
to preserve your dignity,

185
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:29,340
should you study

186
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:30,699
and retake the exam?

187
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:38,312
(He Rufei, C)

188
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,899
Retaking the exam for this

189
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,419
would be truly shameful.

190
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,659
Besides,

191
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,740
it's in the long past.

192
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:48,100
After joining the army,

193
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,059
I kept improving

194
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,860
and became a scholarly general.

195
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:53,059
I master the classics long ago.

196
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,460
The Virtue chapter?

197
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,980
Unshaken by external things.

198
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,220
How's it, father?

199
00:09:58,299 --> 00:09:59,140
Did I do it well?

200
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,020
Huaijin, if you wish,

201
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,260
I can...

202
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,140
No need.

203
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,659
I mean,

204
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,340
to recite the Virtue chapter again.

205
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:10,699
What's on your mind?

206

This is my first time

at Yaojing's Lantern Festival.

215
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:02,460
It's much livelier than

216
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,260
Water God Festival!

217
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,020
Your wish to wander,

219
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:16,260
Sugar figure.

220
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:17,288
Huaijin.

221
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,220
Want a sugar figure?

222
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:18,939
Buy you one.

223
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:20,819
Well,

224
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,579
one with a phoenix?

225
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:24,380
Or one with a Kylin?

226
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:27,080
No.

227
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:28,340
No?

228
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:29,980
I have money.

229
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:30,980
I'll buy you one.

230
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:33,100
No basket-shaped ones here.

231
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:37,899
You like baskets?

232
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:39,460
Someone made

233
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,860
a candy basket
for Mr. Chu in Jiyang City?

234
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:51,819
Are you

235
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,059
feeling jealous?

236
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:56,340
I never expected

237
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,380
that the mighty General Fengyun

238
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,059
would become so jealous.

239
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,699
I am jealous.

240
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,419
No matter how generous one is,

241
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:06,220
after falling for someone,

242
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:07,779
they'd be jealous easily.

243
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,740
Moreover,

244
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:12,659
he was up to something.

245
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:15,899
Back then,

246
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:17,539
he gave me a tassel.

247
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,899
You know

248
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:20,299
the hardest favors to repay

249
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:21,340
are kindness.

250
00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:22,579
But

251
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,899
we are different.

252
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,380
We don't need

253
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:26,579
clear lines.

254
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:28,460
Just like you,

255
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:29,699
I'm also unwavering.

256
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:31,059
I won't love other man.

257
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:33,896
Come on.

258
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:35,048
Sir.

259
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,260
One sugar figure.

260
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:37,579
May I draw it myself?

261
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:38,980
Of course.

262
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:40,712
Here.

263
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,408
Done!

264
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,539
You can stop

265
00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:20,860
being jealous.

266
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:28,340
But

267
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,860
this might be too large.

268
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,460
It's hard to carry.

269
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:41,220
Don't worry, miss.

270
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,340
We can deliver it

271
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,340
to your mansion.

272
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,500
Really?

273
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,059
Thank you so much.

274
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,020
This one.

275
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:06,472
How is it?

276
00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:08,980
General Yan.

277
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:11,496
He Yan.

278
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:13,620
What a rare sight!

279
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:14,779
Never expected you

280
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,380
to stroll through night markets.

281
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:18,179
This must be

282
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,980
you wife, right?

283
00:14:19,995 --> 00:14:21,000
(Xia Chengxiu, Yan He's Wife)

284
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,579
In Rundu,

285
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,860
General Yan mentioned you often.

286
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,140
And this

287
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,659
must be General He.

288
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,419
I've long heard of your fame.

289
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,620
Enough with the formalities.

290
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,460
Xiao Jue, you're here
for the lantern riddles too?

291
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,819
Then go solve

292
00:14:37,939 --> 00:14:38,620
the riddles.

293
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,179
Look how many I've solved already.

294
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:42,939
He's not solving them,

295
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:43,939
but

296
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:46,260
I'll solve one for him.

297
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,620
Xiu, I want you to solve one for me too.

298
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,712
Alright.

299
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,579
Pick one.

300
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,824
(Lantern Riddles)

301
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,419
The blue one then.

302
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:06,380
This character is remarkable
with four strokes...

303
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,699
Where should I hang this lantern?

304
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,779
What's the perfect spot?

305
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:14,740
Here then.

306
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:16,899
Even sages would bow before it.

307
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:17,860
Wait!

308
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:23,179
Ten and one at the bottom,
and three on top.

309
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:24,899
It's "Lei".

310
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,260
Brilliant, miss!

311
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,340
This lantern is yours.

312
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,760
Thank you.

313
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:35,976
Sir.

314
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:37,260
Why is

315
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,380
hers nicer than mine?

316
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:41,939
Sir!

317
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:06,059

we're especially lucky today?

322
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,059

00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,900
you even make Feinu
release Kongming lanterns?

389
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:38,500
How thoughtful.

390
00:20:39,964 --> 00:20:41,903
♪Chasing the light within my heart♪

391
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:45,911
♪Burying frailty,
embracing life through death♪

392
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:51,919
♪You'll meet gazes where storms brew♪

393
00:20:52,808 --> 00:20:57,020
♪With our unwavering true love,
brave the world with me♪

394
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,472
(Chu Mansion)

395
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,379
This was a gift from her.

396
00:21:03,139 --> 00:21:03,819
She said,

397
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:06,260
"Zilan" means nobility and purity.

398
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,859
Only those who love me

399
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,619
would give me such a name.

400
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,619
She gifted this to me.

401
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,220
She must have loved me.

402
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:22,900
Young Master,

403
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,740
look at this lantern.

404
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:26,139
Young Master.

405
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:34,539
(She loves me.)

406
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:36,420
She loves me.

407
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:39,220
She must have loved me.

408
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,379
Why did it shatter?

409
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:43,539
Why?

410
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,579
Why must it be

411
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:45,819
the very gift from her?

412
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,579
Young Master.

413
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:48,139
Why?

414
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:49,220
Why?

415
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,260
Why can't I

416
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,420
ever have anything I desire?

417
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:54,952
Young Master.

418
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,020
It's fate.

419
00:21:56,139 --> 00:21:57,020
Why force it?

420
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:00,980
Young Master.

421
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:02,376
Young Master.

422
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,379
Then you'll draft

423
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:21,619
the edict.

424
00:22:22,379 --> 00:22:23,180
Understood.

425
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,579
The plum blossoms in the tiny vase

426
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,779
radiate such vibrant fragrance.

427
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,099
Indeed.

428
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,819
This year's plum blooms

429
00:22:36,139 --> 00:22:37,099
are really splendid.

430
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,180
Quite true.

431
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:40,980
The plum tree south of the city

432
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,099
is also in full bloom.

433
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:43,379
Yesterday,

434
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,460
General Fengyun went to pluck blossoms

435
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,500
for a young lady.

436
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:49,339
Xiao Jue?

437
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,059
For which young lady?

438
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,420
She is

439
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,260
no ordinary lady,

440
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:56,180
but General Feihong.

441
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:57,900
This

442
00:22:58,059 --> 00:22:59,900
has become a romantic legend.

443
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,020
All agree the two generals

444
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,940
are destined.

445
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:05,539
Young nobles and ladies

446
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:06,379
now visit

447
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:07,980
the plum trees in pairs

448
00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:10,020
to pray for blessings.

449
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,779
Indeed.

450
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,859
Fengyun and Feihong

451
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,819
truly make a peerless pair.

452
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,379
He Yan and Xiao Jue

453
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:20,819
make a peerless pair.

454
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,740
But General Feihong

455
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,099
and General Fengyun

456
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,220
can't be a good match.

457
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,980
What's different?

458
00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:31,339
General Feihong and Fengyun

459
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,500
hold strong military forces.

460
00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:57,059
It's quite special to be

461
00:23:58,139 --> 00:23:59,099
on the rooftop at night.

462
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,379
When I was young,

463
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:02,859
before joining the army,

464
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:04,420
I loved the rooftops.

465
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,020
He Mansion's rooftop

466
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,220
was even higher.

467
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,139
My martial arts were poor.

468
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,059
I could only climb using ladders.

469
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:13,059
Once when I was halfway up,

470
00:24:13,339 --> 00:24:14,059
I fell down.

471
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:16,260
Afraid of being noticed,

472
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,260
I didn't shout out.

473
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,139
For a long time after,

474
00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:20,339
my back kept hurting.

475
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:23,139
Why love being on the rooftops?

476
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,859
Because they are high enough

477
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,619
to reach for the moon

478
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,619
and pluck stars

479
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,180
from the sky.

480
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,059
Childish.

481
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,099
What?

482
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,420
Everyone was so.

483
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,299
If you like it,

484
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,059
every rooftop in my mansion

485
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:48,180
will be yours.

486
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:50,379
Even after marriage,

487
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:50,859
okay?

488
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:51,784
Okay.

489
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:53,539
We'll climb together,

490
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,180
okay?

491
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:54,920
Okay.

492
00:24:56,379 --> 00:24:57,579
If we need to bring snacks...

493
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,500
As long as you like it,

494
00:24:59,299 --> 00:24:59,740
I'm okay.

495
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,180
What's funny?

496
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,779
I was thinking

497
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:11,859
the mighty General Fengyun

498
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:13,980
would climb roofs with me.

499
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:15,299
Moreover,

500
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:17,339
I regain control of the Fuyue Army.

501
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:19,339
You and the Xiao Army

502
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,819
might become obsolete.

503
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,180
Nothing keeping you busy?

504
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,180
Such bold words.

505
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:28,859
It matters not.

506
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:31,059
Merit determines

507
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:32,539
position.

508
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,460
I won't show any mercy.

509
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,420
Likewise.

510
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:39,779
Instead of this talk,

511
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,299
let's discuss

512
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,579
our wedding.

513
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,579
I've hired

514
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:47,059
Yaojing's best embroiderers

515
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,139
to make the bridal gown.

516
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,139
So soon?

517
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:52,619
Soon?

518
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:55,779
I think it's too slow.

519
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,660
Actually,

520
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,020
I feel the same.

521
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,099
I'll measure your shoulders.

522
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,379
Note this down.

523
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:34,460
Miss, raise your arm.

524
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,339
(You are a woman,)

525
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,579
(yet fight on the battlefields,)

526
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,020
(outshining all men.)

527
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,619
(You deserve)

528
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:56,980
(the title of)

529
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,339
(General Feihong.)

530
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,180
Why do you keep staring at me?

531
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:04,579
Beautiful.

532
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,859
You'll look even more stunning

533
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,859
in the wedding dress.

534
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:11,020
Why am I the only one being measured?

535
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,059
Marriage

536
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,500
is about us two.

537
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,568
Yes.

538
00:27:15,139 --> 00:27:15,819
I need it too.

539
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,059
I want you to.

540
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,379
Me?

541
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:35,900
Your shoulders

542
00:27:36,379 --> 00:27:37,619
are much broader than mine.

543
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:38,819
The waist.

544
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,256
Waist?

545
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,700
Measure with hands.

546
00:28:42,379 --> 00:28:43,980
By the imperial decree,

547
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,579
summon General Fengyun Xiao Jue

548
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,579
to the palace.

549
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:01,420
Your Majesty.

550
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,299
Commander Xiao is here.

551
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:06,539
I'm Xiao Jue.

552
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:07,660
Greetings.

553
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:08,776
Rise.

554
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,579
I summoned you urgently

555
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:12,379
due to emerging circumstances.

556
00:29:13,139 --> 00:29:13,940
Are the Wutuo people

557
00:29:14,579 --> 00:29:15,460
making any movements?

558
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,584
Exactly.

559
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,020
I got tips from the border.

560
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:22,260
The Wutuo King had passed away.

561
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,940
His son succeeded the throne.

562
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,619
But his son

563
00:29:25,819 --> 00:29:26,619
is too young.

564
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:28,379
While his uncle

565
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,180
has strong military forces,

566
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,299
eyeing covetously.

567
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,660
The officials

568
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,260
are divided into two factions.

569
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:36,020
The Wutuo

570
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,539
could erupt into civil war any moment.

571
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:41,819
The uncle has accumulated authority.

572
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:44,619
Usurping the throne
is just a matter of time.

573
00:29:45,139 --> 00:29:46,339
To get more power,

574
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,819
given his warlike nature,

575
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,779
he'll surely invade the Wei.

576
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,980
You are absolutely right.

577
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:54,819
Therefore,

578
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:57,220
we shouldn't just watch idly.

579
00:29:57,579 --> 00:29:58,740
Instead, we must prepare

580
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,740
in advance.

581
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,299
I think

582
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:02,660
we should discuss this with

583
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:03,819
General Feihong too.

584
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:15,099
Generals Fengyun and Feihong

585
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:17,900
are the twin stars of Wei.

586
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,379
With both of you here,

587
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:22,539
I can rest easy.

588
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:24,339
I'm flattered.

589
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:25,940
It's our duty

590
00:30:26,579 --> 00:30:27,940
to protect the nation.

591
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:29,740
I heard

592
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,500
you gifted plum blossoms to He Yan.

593
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:36,420
Your Majesty,

594
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,460
He Yan and I

595
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:40,220
love each other.

596
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,420
We agreed...

597
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,779
Your Majesty,
Mr. Chu Zhao requests audience.

598
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:47,859
Let him in.

599
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:49,160
Yes.

600
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,180
By the imperial decree,

601
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,339
summon Mr. Chu Zhao!

602
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,779
- Your Majesty.
- Rise.

603
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,020
What brings you here?

604
00:31:05,619 --> 00:31:06,500
I come here

605
00:31:07,339 --> 00:31:08,579
for personal matters.

606
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,339
Why be so formal?

607
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:20,980
I've long admired a lady.

608
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:23,379
I boldly implore you to issue

609
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:24,740
a marriage decree.

610
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,500
Please grant me.

611
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,819
I see.

612
00:31:30,379 --> 00:31:31,500
Which lady you admire?

613
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:32,700
Tell me.

614
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:35,059
He Yan.

615
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,299
You want to marry He Yan?

616
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:41,940
- Yes.
- No way!

617
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:53,384
Your Majesty,

618
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:55,740
He Yan and I are engaged.

619
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,420
And we're about to marry.

620
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,940
Without proper betrothal rites,

621
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:03,579
can you call it engagement?

622
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:08,740
Your Majesty,

623
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:10,940
I love He Yan...

624
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:12,539
I know.

625
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,260
You and He Yan

626
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:19,139
can marry.

627
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,619
But

628
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,579
General Fengyun and General Feihong

629
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:26,539
cannot.

630
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:30,740
Your Majesty.

631
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,859
I don't want to split lovebirds,

632
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,700
but I have my considerations.

633
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,099
If you insist on marrying He Yan,

634
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:39,339
I won't stop you.

635
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,980
But one of you

636
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:44,139
must surrender

637
00:32:45,819 --> 00:32:47,260
your military authority.

638
00:33:12,379 --> 00:33:12,980
Commander Xiao,

639
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:15,059
you fought so hard

640
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,819
to clear your father's name.

641
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:17,819
And the Xiao Army

642
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,500
barely regained

643
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,500
morale.

644
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:21,500
No one else

645
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:23,059
can command them.

646
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,059
Think it over.

647
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,579
Tomorrow,

648
00:33:41,992 --> 00:33:42,859
tell me your answer.

649
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:50,339
Besides,

650
00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:52,819
no outsiders shall know

651
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:54,740
about this matter.

652
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,779
Understood.

653
00:34:30,259 --> 00:34:30,940
I admit.

654
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:33,300
I'm trying to

655
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,340
steal He Yan from you.

656
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,940
But concentrating

657
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,500
military power has been taboo.

658
00:34:39,259 --> 00:34:40,139
He Yan suffered

659
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,059
so much pain

660
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:41,980
to reclaim her identity

661
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:43,500
as General Feihong.

662
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,139
Can you watch her give up

663
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,659
everything for you?

664
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:49,659
And how could you

665
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:50,940
betray your late father

666
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:52,900
and abandon the Xiao Army

667
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,059
he entrusted to you?

668
00:34:59,059 --> 00:34:59,699
Xiao Jue,

669
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,259
just admit it.

670
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:02,860
You

671
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,420
and He Yan aren't destined.

672
00:35:06,259 --> 00:35:07,259
You and her

673
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,179
cannot be together.

674
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:54,739
What took you so long?

675
00:35:55,059 --> 00:35:56,139
What did His Majesty say?

676
00:35:57,139 --> 00:35:58,579
The Wutuo King suddenly passed away,

677
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,340
succeeded by his young son.

678
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,739
Wutuo King's brother

679
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:03,539
is eyeing the throne for usurpation.

680
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,300
His Majesty fears

681
00:36:05,739 --> 00:36:06,780
the Wutuo's civil war

682
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,820
will endanger

683
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,780
the Wei.

684
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:10,820
Therefore,

685
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,940
we must prepare in advance.

686
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,380
True.

687
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,460
We need to stay alert

688
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,259
of the cunning Wutuo people.

689
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,539
But,

690
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,579
for such crucial matters,

691
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:24,579
why did

692
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,659
His Majesty only summon you?

693
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:36,820
Next time,

694
00:36:38,364 --> 00:36:39,464
His Majesty will summon you

695
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:41,219
to discuss this.

696
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,340
Excellent.

697
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,219
As the General Feihong,

698
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:52,380
you must soar freely

699
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,900
in the sky.

700
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,020
Young Master,

701
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,420
eat something.

702
00:37:48,739 --> 00:37:49,340
I'm not hungry.

703
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,780
Leave now.

704
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:56,860
If you've made up your mind,

705
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,699
why being so troubled?

706
00:38:03,259 --> 00:38:04,300
I am troubled?

707
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,619
Having served you for so long,

708
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:12,259
I can tell

709
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:14,420
you're troubled.

710
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:21,139
You resemble

711
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,259
glacial ice,

712
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,980
crystal clear,

713
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,259
yet chillingly cold.

714
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,500
Miss He

715
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,860
resembles fire,

716
00:38:33,139 --> 00:38:34,059
shining brightly,

717
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:36,820
yet scorching

718
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,940
when you get close.

719
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:41,579
Today, you've spoken

720
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:43,780
too much.

721
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:49,099
I'm sorry.

722
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:51,579
Please eat.

723
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,259
Ice and fire cannot be together.

724
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,820
So what?

725
00:39:19,419 --> 00:39:23,400

726
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:34,344

736
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,940
(I believe I was born)

737
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,980
to be a general.

738
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:53,099
Sometimes, I even feel

739
00:39:53,736 --> 00:39:55,420
I was a female general in my past life.

740
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,099
Impressive, right?

741

You know why I let you lead them?

742
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:01,699
