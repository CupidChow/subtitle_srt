Focus on training.

Feinu.

25
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:37,060
Go to the capital.

26
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,139
Look into He Rufei.

27
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:39,540
Commander...

28
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:40,299
Look into

29
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:41,500
his days before Mingshui,

30
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:43,060
and monitor

31
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,139
his every move now.

32
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:46,152
Understood.

33
00:02:51,132 --> 00:02:56,899
(Xiao)

34
00:02:56,899 --> 00:02:57,416
Mr. He.

35
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,380
You're back.

36
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,060
Mr. Jiang.

37
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,459
May I trouble you

38
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:02,859
with something?

39
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:04,980
There is no "trouble".

40
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,380
Just say the word.

41
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:07,100
No problem.

42
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:08,859
You escort agents

43
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,619
must have connections.

44
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,619
Could you

45
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,780
figure something out?

46
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,419
Who has visited

47
00:03:14,899 --> 00:03:16,500
Yuhua Temple these years

48
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:17,660
and met Miss He,

49
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,619
who was resting in the rear courtyard?

50
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:21,060
Miss He?

51
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,380
He Rufei's little sister.

52
00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:25,060
Mr. Jiang, I know

53
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,540
it sounds abrupt,

54
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,980
but it's important.

55
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,500
Unfortunately,

56
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,660
I can't explain

57
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,500
everything yet.

58
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,500
Escort agents take jobs

59
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,060
without question asked.

60
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:36,500
Besides, you're my buddy.

61
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,340
Consider it

62
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,139
done.

63
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,780
Thank you.

64
00:04:01,619 --> 00:04:02,619
(Before Mingshui Battle,)

65
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,739
(He Rufei was at the Yuhua Temple.)

66
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,299
(So if He Rufei did meet Xu Jingfu,)

67
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,459
(he must have)

68
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,260
(met him at the Yuhua Temple.)

69
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,739
(Mr. Jiang will be able)

70
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:13,859
(to confirm that.)

71
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,499
(Though it's not enough)

72
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,939
(to prove He Rufei's)

73
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:19,819
(involvement in the scheme,)

74
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,700
(at least,)

75
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,739
(it shows the Commander)

76
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:23,780
(that)

77
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,140
(He Rufei is a suspect.)

78
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,259
(Commander)

79
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:29,460
(is investigating for sure)

80
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,379
(and may uncover new leads.)

81
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:37,780
Now,

82
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,020
I just need to hone my skills

83
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,059
and bide my time.

84
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,072
General.

85
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,179
(Stand Tall and See Far)
What's wrong?

86
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:46,140
I found out that

87
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:46,859
a formidable

88
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:48,140
female general fought

89
00:04:48,299 --> 00:04:49,379
alongside Xiao Jue.

90
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,819
A female general?

91
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:56,220
What is she like?

92
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:58,100
Extremely skilled

93
00:04:58,299 --> 00:04:58,819
and valiant,

94
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,619
coming from Yezhou Garrison.

95
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:01,980
At Jiyang,

96
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:02,980
she single-handedly

97
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:04,700
killed Wutuo's commander Huyate.

98
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:07,939
Understood.

99
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:16,340
Could it

100
00:05:17,619 --> 00:05:18,700
be her?

101
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,739
No way.

102
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:23,939
She's supposed to be dead.

103
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,100
Better safe

104
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,980
than sorry.

105
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:31,859
Whether she's He Yan or not,

106
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:34,419
she has to die.

107
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,700
He.

108
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,540
You've been

109
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,460
running for six hours.

110
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,379
Why don't you take a break?

111
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:00,059
Yeah.

112
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,059
Get some rest.

113
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,700
If you keep running...

114
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,700
I'm fine. Not tired yet.

115
00:06:05,059 --> 00:06:06,059
Have some water

116
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:06,939
and eat.

117
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,460
I can skip

118
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,739
a meal.

119
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,020
But you haven't

120
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:13,220
eaten for ages.

121
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,088
Yeah.

122
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:15,700
S-Stop...

123
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,140
S-Stop training.

124
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,819
At least eat something

125
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:19,700
and take a break.

126
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:20,900
If you keep...

127
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,152
This is...

128
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,499
- S-Stop training.
- He.

129
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,540
He.

130
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:30,340
Wait.

131
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:32,819
S-Stop...

132
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:36,419
Still running?

133
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,580
H-He's...

134
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,460
still training?

135
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,939
Take a break.

136
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,460
I bet he is bothered by something.

137
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,540
That's why

138
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,020
he's tormenting himself.

139
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,900
Mr. Chu.

140
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,660
Miss Xu.

141
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:25,980
Is this for my father

142
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:27,259
or me?

143
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,580
I roamed around

144
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,739
during Water God Festival

145
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:32,020
in Jiyang.

146
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,819
The moment I saw this,

147
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:34,980
I felt that

148
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,020
it suits you perfectly.

149
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:38,259
I hope you will accept it.

150
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:48,859
Courtesy requires a return.

151
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:50,700
I prepared some pastries.

152
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,140
Would you join me

153
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:54,580
in the pavilion

154
00:07:55,179 --> 00:07:57,379
to have pastries
while admiring the flowers?

155
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,419
Miss Xu.

156
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,580
I...

157
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,460
haven't paid respects to Master.

158
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:08,232
But

159
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,859
it won't take

160
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,739
that long.

161
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:13,140
Perhaps you could go ahead,

162
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,340
and I'll join you

163
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,140
very soon.

164
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:16,840
Alright.

165
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:18,819
See you later.

166
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:30,020
Zilan.

167
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,060
You're usually reliable,

168
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,820
but you have truly disappointed me

169
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,539
with this mission in Jiyang.

170
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:43,976
Master.

171
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:45,499
I failed to kill Chai Anxi,

172
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:46,980
in fear of

173
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,700
alerting our enemies.

174
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:53,220
What did Chai Anxi say?

175
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,340
He told Xiao Jue

176
00:08:56,379 --> 00:08:57,580
what happened in Mingshui.

177
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,379
He said He Rufei

178
00:08:59,859 --> 00:09:00,539
made him withhold

179
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,659
Xiao Zhongwu's letter.

180
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:11,060
That's all?

181
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:21,019
Now that he's learned my deepest secret,

182
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:23,779
he won't tell the truth.

183
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,659
He'll be scared that I'd silence him,

184
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:27,980
or

185
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,300
he'll try to blackmail me.

186
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:33,779
If he doesn't tell the truth,

187
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,259
I will drop the bracelet,

188
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,739
and you shall kill him.

189
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,220
Understood.

190
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,259
He also said

191
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:56,980
that you

192
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,259
were the mastermind

193
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,100
of the scheme.

194
00:10:22,619 --> 00:10:24,180
Aren't you scared

195
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,659
I'd silence you
because of what you said?

196
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,619
I've always wanted to earn

197
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:34,539
your utmost trust.

198
00:10:35,859 --> 00:10:37,420
But my limitations

199
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,060
made my goal

200
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:39,859
impossible.

201
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,580
This has long troubled me.

202
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,940
Now that I know your secret,

203
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,300
I see it as

204
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:48,460
a double-edged sword.

205
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:51,580
Though you may silence me

206
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:52,539
as a precaution,

207
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,899
I feel more joy than worry,

208
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:56,899
for I'll defend this secret

209
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,980
with my life,

210
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,619
which bonds us deeper.

211
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,980
I believe

212
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:04,779
that I am finally

213
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:06,420
qualified

214
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,300
to earn your trust

215
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,460
and share your burdens.

216
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,980
Zilan.

217
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:25,940
I was joking with you.

218
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:27,340
But I wasn't

219
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,420
joking with you.

220
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:32,659
I failed the mission.

221
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,980
I'll find a way

222
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:35,739
to make amends.

223
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:37,580
Do you have a plan?

224
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:41,899
Though Chai Anxi is dead,

225
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,180
Xiao Jue won't let this go.

226
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,739
In my opinion,

227
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,779
He Rufei was the perpetrator,

228
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,379
and it had

229
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:51,019
nothing to do with you.

230
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,100
I bet Xiao Jue

231
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:54,659
will investigate He Rufei first.

232
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,300
Once we inform He Rufei

233
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,259
about this,

234
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:59,220
he will surely make a move.

235
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,499
Xiao Jue wants trouble.

236
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,259
Then he can have it.

237
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,259
He left Yezhou

238
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:07,779
without permission.

239
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:09,460
We can't let it slide.

240
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:10,984
Also,

241
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:12,180
a young officer

242
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:14,060
performed remarkably well

243
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:15,499
in the Jiyang Battle.

244
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,580
Considering their contributions,

245
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:18,980
if this officer

246
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,580
receives rewards

247
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,980
while Commander Xiao

248
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:23,180
faces punishment,

249
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:25,139
the veteran troops will surely

250
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,460
grow discontent.

251
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,820
When conflicts arise,

252
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,139
it will make Xiao Jue

253
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:30,539
look incompetent

254
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,499
in leading

255
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:32,779
the troops.

256
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:36,820
That's what you're thinking?

257
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,899
You should know.

258
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:43,019
If this gets out,

259
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,340
it would be a felony.

260
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,420
Your guidance has been vital to me.

261
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:51,739
Without you,

262
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,300
I wouldn't be here today.

263
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:56,060
I swear I'll eliminate

264
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,460
all threats

265
00:12:57,499 --> 00:12:58,220
to you,

266
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:58,859
even if

267
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:01,820
it costs me

268
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:03,139
my very life.

269
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:26,340
Father.

270
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:29,539
Father.

271
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,499
Pingting.

272
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:39,899
What brings you here?

273
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:41,859
Can't I just check on you?

274
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:44,940
Father.

275
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,659
Why did you make Mr. Chu kneel?

276
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,340
What did he do wrong?

277
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,659
Let him get up.

278
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,379
I'm waiting

279
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,580
to see flowers with him.

280
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,420
Naughty girl.

281
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,060
I have important matters

282
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,379
to discuss with Zilan.

283
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:01,700
Father,

284
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,139
flower viewing

285
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,220
is also important.

286
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,539
Father.

287
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,379
Help me up.

288
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:18,024
Come on.

289
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:20,019
Be careful.

290
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,499
I've said my piece.

291
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:27,619
Understood.

292
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,200
Go ahead.

293
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:34,580
Thank you.

294
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,512
Master,

295
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,139
I have one more question.

296
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:48,499
Please enlighten me.

297
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:50,580
What is it?

298
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:52,300
What should I tell His Majesty

299
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:53,700
tomorrow?

300
00:14:56,859 --> 00:14:57,580
Zilan,

301
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:01,899
His Majesty bears the world
on his shoulders.

302
00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:03,980
As his ministers,

303
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,659
we must share his burdens.

304
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,379
We don't have to

305
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,980
trouble him
with all the trivial matters.

306
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:12,872
Yes, Master.

307
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:14,460
I

308
00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:16,180
understand.

309
00:15:30,739 --> 00:15:32,940
Tomorrow, someone will bring you

310
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:36,139
the cure I found for you.

311
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,779
Will you remain here,

312
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,619
as a caged bird in shadows,

313
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,539
or go out there

314
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:46,220
as the mighty General Feihong?

315
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:48,739
Think carefully.

316
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:55,180
General Feihong.

317
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,019
Just a second.

318
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,899
Let me inform...

319
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,659
Step aside.

320
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:58,499
Master.

321
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,176
Master.

322
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:01,224
- Master.
- Chancellor.

323
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,460
General Feihong.

324
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:08,420
This is my mansion.

325
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:10,980
How dare you

326
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:12,300
barge in like this?

327
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:15,379
I apologize.

328
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:17,659
But this is urgent.

329
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,619
Xiao Jue achieved military merits

330
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:20,379
in Jiyang again.

331
00:16:20,619 --> 00:16:21,859
Doesn't it mean that he will

332
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,139
regain influence?

333
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,220
I thought it was something urgent.

334
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,980
He just won a battle, that's all.

335
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,820
Do you have to be so scared?

336
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:34,980
Get up.

337
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,899
However,

338
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,539
I did hear something.

339
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:45,139
Chai Anxi didn't die

340
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,739
at Mingshui.

341
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,980
Xiao Jue found him

342
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:50,100
two days ago.

343
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,580
T-Then...

344
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,820
What should I do?

345
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,659
Xiao Jue will bring him

346
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,899
to His Majesty.

347
00:16:58,379 --> 00:16:59,379
Help me, Chancellor.

348
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,139
Rest easy.

349
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:02,580
I've already

350
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,180
dealt with it.

351
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,499
Chai Anxi is dead.

352
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,059
He won't be coming.

353
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,819
But Xiao Jue

354
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,539
won't let this go.

355
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,620
He'll keep searching for evidence.

356
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,180
You must be careful

357
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,499
not to leave any traces behind.

358
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,940
After all,

359
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,299
the one who contacted Chai Anxi

360
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,739
was you.

361
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:42,660
Rest assured.

362
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:43,779
I won't

363
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:45,099
let Xiao Jue

364
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,339
get any dirt on me.

365
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:47,779
Good.

366
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,620
After all,

367
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,339
military promotions
hinge on battlefield merits.

368
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,059
Xiao Jue is brave and smart.

369
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:59,259
Halting his ascension

370
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,660
poses genuine difficulty.

371
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:06,380
Then let's end it at once.

372
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,499
Chancellor.

373
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:09,299
Why don't we work with Wutuo

374
00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:11,299
and do what we did
to Xiao Zhongwu again?

375
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:22,660
Rest assured.

376
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:24,460
I've devised a plan.

377
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:32,380
Let's ally with Wutuo

378
00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:33,700
to create a diversion.

379
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,420
They'll attack Huayuan.

380
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,140
I'll volunteer to fight

381
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,460
and stage a show with the Wutuo army

382
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,539
while giving them

383
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:42,620
Rundu's Military Defense Maps

384
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,140
in secret

385
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,140
for them to launch a surprise attack.

386
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:45,940
When Rundu

387
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:47,099
pleads for help,

388
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,660
I'll delay reinforcement.

389
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,980
Xiao Jue won't

390
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:51,499
sit back and do nothing.

391
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:53,620
We'll set a trap

392
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,779
to kill him

393
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:55,739
there.

394
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:06,339
Then I will

395
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,019
start preparing.

396
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,220
(I can't tell)

397
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,579
(Chancellor Xu)

398
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,499
(about He Yan yet.)

399
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,539
(Otherwise, he would)

400
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,099
(lose faith in me)

401
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,460
(and pin the blame on me.)

402
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:31,019
(That's his plan)

403
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,019
(for explaining)

404
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:32,904
(the Mingshui defeat.)

405
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,180
(Luckily, I'm prepared.)

406
00:19:34,739 --> 00:19:36,380
(He Yan is close to the Eight Warriors)

407
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:37,620
(of Fuyue Army.)

408
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,539
(Seven now serve under me.)

409
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:41,420
(One commands Rundu Garrison.)

410
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,259
(If she is alive,)

411
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:45,099
(then I can kill)

412
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,339
(all seven warriors in Huayuan)

413
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:48,900
(and use the one in Rundu)

414
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,579
(as bait.)

415
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:51,739
(That's how I manipulate her)

416
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,180
(to go to Rundu.)

417
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,019
(There,)

418
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,499
(she'll meet her demise.)

419
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:58,900
(If she is truly dead,)

420
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,660
(eliminating all Eight Warriors)

421
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,380
(still benefits my cause.)

422
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,299
(Besides,)

423
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:05,460
(I will be able)

424
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:08,259
(to get rid of Xiao Jue in the process.)

425
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:10,728
Young Master.

426
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:11,980
Did Chancellor Xu really

427
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:13,420
plan to kill you?

428
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,180
I've passed this test.

429
00:20:29,499 --> 00:20:30,220
Greater storms

430
00:20:30,739 --> 00:20:31,980
are yet to come, though.

431
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:33,832
Young Master.

432
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:34,779
So what is

433
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:35,819
our next move?

434
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,380
As long as I earn his trust,

435
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,819
I will find out

436
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:41,980
his next move.

437
00:20:43,739 --> 00:20:44,380
If he colludes

438
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:45,620
with Wutuo,

439
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:47,059
we'll take precautions.

440
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,232
Huaijin.

441
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:57,660
What's wrong

442
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,700
with you and Miss He?

443
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:00,099
Why aren't you

444
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:00,980
speaking at all?

445
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,299
We are

446
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,739
just fine.

447
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,900
Commander Xiao.

448
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,860
You know all the war strategies.

449
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,099
How can you be

450
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:12,499
so clueless with women?

451
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:13,900
You didn't

452
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,059
seize the opportunity

453
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:15,660
in Chonghuai

454
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,819
and grew increasingly distant.

455
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:18,980
Miss He

456
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:20,779
is a sensitive young lady,

457
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,019
after all.

458
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:23,460
Do you want her

459
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,860
to feel abandoned?

460
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,180
None of your business.

461
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,288
I...

462
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:33,259
I'm offering you advice.

463
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:36,700
Seriously.

at Yuhua Temple.

467
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:06,860
Besides her parents,

468
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,140
she only met one unexpected visitor.

469
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:11,499
He was not an ordinary man,

470
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,900
but Chancellor Xu Jingfu.

471
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:16,940
He sat with Miss He

472
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:18,460
in the meditation room

473
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:20,099
(and played chess for a while.)

474
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,980
He Rufei.

475
00:22:22,499 --> 00:22:23,579

(Commander.)

500
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,460
Let me lead the elite squad

501
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:37,819
to draw away Huyate's heavy infantry.

502
00:26:04,284 --> 00:26:07,286
(Xiao)

503
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:30,664
Young Master.

504
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,900
His Majesty sent Yan He
with us to Yezhou.

505
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:33,819
Is Chancellor Xu

506
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:34,900
behind this?

507
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:36,420
Yan He is a rising star

508
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,380
from a loyal family.

509
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:39,980
I think His Majesty

510
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:41,299
wants him to tag along.

511
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,700
So, His Majesty

512
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,460
intends to promote Yan He.

513
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:46,259
Then you...

514
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:46,984
It's fine.

515
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,328
He's a military man.

516
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,544
I'm a civil official.

517
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,460
Why would I compete with him?

518
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,900
Are you promoted to

519
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,152
Director of the Ministry of War

520
00:27:54,499 --> 00:27:55,620
because you've earned

521
00:27:55,819 --> 00:27:56,779
His Majesty's trust?

522
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:02,499
(Mr. Chu.)

523
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:05,259
The battle in Jiyang

524
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,700
strikes me as peculiar.

525
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:10,299
Did you notice anything fishy

526
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,539
back then?

527
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,539
Your Majesty,

528
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,739
before the battle,

529
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:16,860
many Wutuo spies

530
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,259
infiltrated Jiyang

531
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,460
and even attempted

532
00:28:19,499 --> 00:28:20,860
to abduct the little princess.

533
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:22,539
Thus, I believe that

534
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:23,620
Wutuo people

535
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,499
have been plotting this.

536
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:26,760
They may

537
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,539
wage another war against us.

538
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:30,099
We must be alert.

539
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,739
I also heard that General Fengyun

540
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,140
saved Jiyang single-handedly.

541
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,579
What is

542
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:40,779
your opinion?

543
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:44,420
In my humble opinion,

544
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,499
General Fengyun
may have defended Jiyang,

545
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,660
but he did leave Yezhou
without permission.

546
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:52,819
Still, his achievements
outweigh his faults.

547
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:55,180
I implore you to show leniency

548
00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:56,940
lest others grow discontent.

549
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:58,380
After all,

550
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:00,299
without General Fengyun

551
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,259
and that

552
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:02,299
brave young soldier,

553
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,779
Jiyang wouldn't have

554
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,059
regained peace so fast.

555
00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:06,819
Brave young soldier?

556
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,940
Are you referring to He Yan,

557
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,860
who single-handedly

558
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,900
killed the Wutuo commander

559
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,660
Huyate?

560
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,059
Exactly.

561
00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:25,499
I've also heard that

562
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,660
when Wutuo forces
attacked Yezhou Garrison,

563
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:30,980
He Yan managed to

564
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,380
crush Rida Muzi

565
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,380
to demonstrate our prestige.

566
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:36,940
To emerge distinguished

567
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:38,700
from General Fengyun's towering shadow,

568
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,539
this young man

569
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,660
truly possesses remarkable skill.

570
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,180
Mr. Chu,

571
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,180
you keep asking for rewards

572
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:51,339
on others' behalf.

573
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:52,298
What about yourself?

574
00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:54,059
During the battle,

575
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,099
you did a great job by reallocating

576
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,420
the citizens.

577
00:29:58,779 --> 00:29:59,432
Tell me.

578
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:01,779
What reward would you have?

579
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:06,248
Your Majesty,

580
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:07,700
I seek

581
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:09,819
a higher position.

582
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:21,380
You've always disdained

583
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,499
such worldly pursuits

584
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,579
and declined rewards like this.

585
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,019
Why are you

586
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,900
seeking promotion

587
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,900
this time?

588
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,499
Your Majesty,

589
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:37,380
I used to believe

590
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,739
that a minister

591
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,460
only needed to be loyal.

592
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:42,980
But through recent experience,

593
00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:44,339
I've realized

594
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,779
that loyalty alone

595
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:47,620
without actual power is not enough.

596
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,660
Therefore,

597
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,660
I seek greater influence

598
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,259
to better serve Your Majesty

599
00:30:53,499 --> 00:30:54,460
in greater causes.

600
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,779
I see.

601
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,140
Alright then.

602
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,380
I appoint you
as Director of the Ministry of War.

603
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,779
Stay diligent

604
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,220
and uphold your duties.

605
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,739
Do not

606
00:31:11,739 --> 00:31:12,900
let me down.

607
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:18,380
Thank you, Your Majesty.

608
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:27,980
A ruler

609
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:30,099
never trusts others lightly.

610
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,220
Demonstrating my capabilities

611
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,660
and weaknesses

612
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:34,660
makes me appear

613
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,460
easily controllable

614
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,660
to His Majesty.

615
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:39,620
When I finally possess power,

616
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:41,140
I can guide Wei back to

617
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,660
righteous governance.

618
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:48,259
(Imperial Edict)

619
00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:48,779
Young Master,

620
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,220
forgive my boldness,

621
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:52,220
but you shouldn't have asked

622
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:53,259
to reward Miss He.

623
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,499
Chancellor Xu will

624
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:55,539
grow suspicious.

625
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,940
Do you think

626
00:31:58,299 --> 00:31:59,900
I'm so clueless and reckless?

627
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,059
That's not what I meant.

628
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:03,620
I do

629
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:06,099
harbor personal motives,

630
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,380
but this decree serves

631
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,380
as a stepping stone.

632
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:12,099
Huayuan in jeopardy!

633
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,660
Huayuan in jeopardy!

634
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:16,460
Huayuan in jeopardy!

635
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,660
I heard Wutuo attacked Huayuan.

636
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,499
Is that true?

637
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:25,700
They just lost in Jiyang.

638
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,819
Another attack?

639
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,220
It's confirmed.

640
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,499
Someone just reported to Mr. Shen,

641
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:31,700
and I overheard it.

642
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:33,860
(Wutuo attacked Huayuan?)

643
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,980
(First Jiyang, now Huayuan.)

644
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,739
(The Wutuo army)

645
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:40,220
(seems to be probing)

646
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:41,420
(our military capabilities.)

647
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,620
(They might plan to start a war.)

648
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,620
General Feihong is leading

649
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,760
the troops to Huayuan.

650
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:48,339
He'll surely crush

651
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:49,499
those Wutuo soldiers!

652
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:51,019
Definitely.

653
00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:52,860
