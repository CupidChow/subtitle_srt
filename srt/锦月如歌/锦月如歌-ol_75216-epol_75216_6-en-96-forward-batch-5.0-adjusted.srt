Wait, Mr. Shen.

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,823
But He took first place.

26
00:01:53,064 --> 00:01:54,543
- He...
- First place, so what?

27
00:01:56,504 --> 00:01:57,383
Get back to it.

28
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:58,424
Don't make a scene.

29
00:02:00,224 --> 00:02:01,296
Listen up, all of you.

30
00:02:01,296 --> 00:02:02,983
Commander selects the candidate

31
00:02:03,184 --> 00:02:05,103
based on a comprehensive evaluation.

32
00:02:06,144 --> 00:02:08,543
The competition was just one aspect.

33
00:02:23,704 --> 00:02:24,903
They've got poor judgment.

34
00:02:25,184 --> 00:02:26,024
Right.

35
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:26,864
Come on.

36
00:02:27,343 --> 00:02:28,183
Let's drink.

37
00:02:28,183 --> 00:02:29,023
Let's drink.

38
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:31,183
So eager to join the battalion?

39
00:02:35,183 --> 00:02:36,384
Only then

40
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:38,384
can I earn merits in combats.

41
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:40,463
Only then can I become a general.

42
00:02:41,864 --> 00:02:44,304
In such a hurry for glorious homecoming?

43
00:02:52,063 --> 00:02:53,144
I have no family.

44
00:02:56,663 --> 00:02:57,704
All I want

45
00:02:59,384 --> 00:03:00,783
is to prove my worth.

46
00:03:02,424 --> 00:03:03,264
Lei Hou

47
00:03:03,903 --> 00:03:05,304
is your defeated opponent.

48
00:03:05,943 --> 00:03:07,504
Huaijin chose him over you.

49
00:03:08,183 --> 00:03:09,223
That's his loss.

50
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:49,663
Let's drink.

51
00:03:51,223 --> 00:03:52,063
Here.

52
00:03:54,743 --> 00:03:55,864
The Mid-Autumn Festival.

53
00:03:56,264 --> 00:03:57,183
Family reunion day.

54
00:03:57,984 --> 00:03:59,503
I'll drink my fill.

55
00:04:04,063 --> 00:04:04,903
Cheers.

56
00:04:06,743 --> 00:04:08,583
- Being happy, I won't get drunk.
- Eat a lot.

57
00:04:24,543 --> 00:04:25,383
Xiao Jue.

58
00:04:25,504 --> 00:04:26,543
You've gone too far!

59
00:04:27,663 --> 00:04:28,503
What did you call me?

60
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:34,463
Xiao Jue.

61
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:39,663
Are you stupid?

62
00:04:40,024 --> 00:04:42,543
You don't even know your name.

63
00:04:48,504 --> 00:04:49,344
Xiao Jue.

64
00:04:49,543 --> 00:04:50,903
Do you know who I am?

65
00:04:54,184 --> 00:04:55,024
Who are you?

66
00:05:03,184 --> 00:05:04,024
I

67
00:05:04,663 --> 00:05:05,904
have been walking around

68
00:05:05,904 --> 00:05:06,904
with only one name.

69
00:05:07,344 --> 00:05:08,184
That is

70
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:09,024
He Yan.

71
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:10,104
The top one

72
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:12,263
of Yezhou Garrison.

73
00:05:25,663 --> 00:05:26,903
How much did you drink?

74
00:05:29,103 --> 00:05:30,736
Go sober up.

75
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:37,864
Sober up.

76
00:05:40,303 --> 00:05:41,744
Go sober up.

77
00:05:51,543 --> 00:05:52,383
Wait.

78
00:05:53,504 --> 00:05:54,663
Why should I leave?

79
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:57,144
You haven't told me

80
00:05:58,023 --> 00:06:01,103
why you didn't
let me join the battalion.

81
00:06:01,504 --> 00:06:02,344
I am

82
00:06:02,344 --> 00:06:03,944
the top one of Yezhou Garrison,

83
00:06:06,704 --> 00:06:08,863
an outstanding candidate.

84
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:10,943
You

85
00:06:11,624 --> 00:06:13,103
have terrible judgment!

86
00:06:20,103 --> 00:06:22,903
I actually know
why you didn't select me.

87
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:24,863
You suspect

88
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:26,744
there's a spy.

89
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:34,663
But you kept testing me repeatedly.

90
00:06:34,864 --> 00:06:36,783
You clearly know I'm not.

91
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,344
Lei Hou.

92
00:06:47,423 --> 00:06:48,504
It's Lei Hou.

93
00:06:54,264 --> 00:06:55,104
See?

94
00:06:55,543 --> 00:06:56,624
Am I clever?

95
00:06:59,144 --> 00:07:00,384
You are clever indeed.

96
00:07:01,223 --> 00:07:02,103
But clever people

97
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:04,423
often meet bad ends.

98
00:07:04,903 --> 00:07:06,463
What bad end?

99
00:07:07,423 --> 00:07:08,584
Let me tell you.

100
00:07:08,848 --> 00:07:10,703
I, He Yan,

101
00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:11,903
will one day

102
00:07:12,663 --> 00:07:14,504
become a celebrated general.

103
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:45,303
He Yan.

104
00:08:01,103 --> 00:08:01,943
Put it back.

105
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:04,783
He Yan, put it back.

106
00:08:05,223 --> 00:08:06,063
Commander.

107
00:08:06,264 --> 00:08:08,463
Don't be angry.

108
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,463
I'll perform a sword dance for you.

109
00:09:09,663 --> 00:09:10,503
Know you're wrong?

110
00:09:18,464 --> 00:09:19,304
No need to kneel.

111
00:09:28,504 --> 00:09:29,504
Xiao Jue,

112
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,104
do you like me?

113
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,543
Feinu,

114
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:40,783
this is...?

115
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:43,903
I will bring dinner for the Commander.
What about you?

116
00:09:43,943 --> 00:09:45,984
The banquet is not over. Why come here?

117
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:48,303
I've been selected for the battalion.

118
00:09:48,823 --> 00:09:50,183
I wanted to thank the Commander.

119
00:09:50,744 --> 00:09:52,224
But I never expected he...

120
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:02,063
You must dislike me.

121
00:10:02,663 --> 00:10:03,503
Otherwise,

122
00:10:03,744 --> 00:10:06,864
why wouldn't you
let me join the battalion?

123
00:10:09,903 --> 00:10:10,743
Let go.

124
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:13,184
This is outrageous.

125
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:14,344
You have poor judgment.

126
00:10:14,344 --> 00:10:15,744
I'm so disappointed in you.

127
00:10:16,504 --> 00:10:17,344
Tell me.

128
00:10:18,304 --> 00:10:19,984
In terms of looks,

129
00:10:20,344 --> 00:10:21,184
martial skills,

130
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,704
or height,

131
00:10:23,783 --> 00:10:24,663
where am I lacking?

132
00:10:26,664 --> 00:10:28,464
Tell me, where am I lacking?

133
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:31,304
Height?

134
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:35,264
Even considering

135
00:10:35,663 --> 00:10:37,903
our bond,

136
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:39,703
shouldn't you at least

137
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,663
add one more slot?

138
00:10:43,264 --> 00:10:44,624
What bond?

139
00:10:46,264 --> 00:10:47,744
You're reneging on your promise.

140
00:10:48,663 --> 00:10:50,543
I...

141
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,063
I'll prove it to you.

142
00:10:52,864 --> 00:10:53,704
I...

143
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:56,304
Here we go again.

144
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:05,944
Let go of me.

145
00:11:28,744 --> 00:11:29,663
Xiao Jue.

146
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:34,264
If you don't give me that extra slot,

147
00:11:35,183 --> 00:11:36,183
I'll...

148
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:38,624
I'll...

149
00:11:40,063 --> 00:11:40,984
What will you do?

150
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,104
I'll...

151
00:11:46,543 --> 00:11:47,864
I'll...

152
00:12:01,823 --> 00:12:02,864
Comfortable sleep?

153
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,344
Very cozy.

154
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:17,143
Mr. He,

155
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:20,264
you slept soundly in Huaijin's tent.

156
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,144
Truly extraordinary.

157
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,383
The Commander's tent?

158
00:12:29,864 --> 00:12:30,704
Yes.

159
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:35,384
To make space for you,

160
00:12:35,472 --> 00:12:36,744
last night,

161
00:12:36,744 --> 00:12:38,543
Huaijin squeezed into my place.

162
00:12:39,104 --> 00:12:40,864
Well? Did you remember anything?

163
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,304
Seems like you did.

164
00:13:21,103 --> 00:13:22,823
Did he mention how to punish me?

165
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:24,383
No.

166
00:13:26,063 --> 00:13:27,744
But he looked furious.

167
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:30,344
Oh no.

168
00:13:32,744 --> 00:13:34,103
Oh no, oh no.

169
00:13:34,103 --> 00:13:34,943
Forget the battalion.

170
00:13:34,943 --> 00:13:36,144
I might not stay here anymore.

171
00:13:36,864 --> 00:13:38,104
What to do? What to do?

172
00:13:38,303 --> 00:13:39,143
Not necessarily.

173
00:13:40,464 --> 00:13:41,304
Consider this.

174
00:13:41,543 --> 00:13:43,504
You used his treasured sword

175
00:13:43,504 --> 00:13:45,136
to smash his beloved zither,

176
00:13:45,136 --> 00:13:46,183
but he didn't kill you

177
00:13:46,264 --> 00:13:47,504
and even made space for you.

178
00:13:48,384 --> 00:13:49,224
Think about it.

179
00:13:49,744 --> 00:13:51,216
Why did he treat you so kindly?

180
00:13:52,423 --> 00:13:53,663
He must've noticed

181
00:13:53,823 --> 00:13:55,864
your unique physique.

182
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:01,543
Unique...

183
00:14:04,063 --> 00:14:05,624
Unique physique?

184
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:11,224
(Could it be)

185
00:14:11,504 --> 00:14:13,104
(he discovered I'm a woman?)

186
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:16,104
You're a rare prodigy.

187
00:14:16,264 --> 00:14:17,703
That's why he tolerates you.

188
00:14:21,024 --> 00:14:21,864
Am I wrong?

189
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:46,023
Xiao Jue.

190
00:14:46,608 --> 00:14:48,080
Do you know who I am?

191
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:51,783
I'm the top one of Yezhou Garrison,

192
00:14:54,183 --> 00:14:55,783
an outstanding candidate.

193
00:14:56,464 --> 00:14:57,584
You

194
00:14:57,584 --> 00:14:59,144
have terrible judgment!

195
00:15:00,103 --> 00:15:00,943
Commander,

196
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,423
please don't be angry.

197
00:15:02,664 --> 00:15:05,303
I'll perform a sword dance for you.

198
00:15:10,063 --> 00:15:11,344
My misbehavior demands

199
00:15:12,063 --> 00:15:14,024
a proper apology to the Commander.

200
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:46,783
Light on his feet,

201
00:15:47,624 --> 00:15:48,543
with steady breath.

202
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:49,624
A skilled fighter.

203
00:15:52,624 --> 00:15:56,336
(Invitation)

204
00:16:01,344 --> 00:16:02,184
Summon Cheng Lisu.

205
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:03,944
Yes.

206
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:11,423
Commander,

207
00:16:11,783 --> 00:16:14,024
drunken words
shouldn't be taken seriously.

208
00:16:14,744 --> 00:16:15,584
Well,

209
00:16:15,864 --> 00:16:16,704
strike me ten times

210
00:16:17,183 --> 00:16:18,303
and let this matter rest.

211
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,623
Commander,

212
00:16:23,864 --> 00:16:24,704
or perhaps

213
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:26,864
I'll forfeit three years' pay

214
00:16:27,224 --> 00:16:28,583
to compensate for your zither.

215
00:16:29,464 --> 00:16:30,624
Please show mercy.

216
00:16:31,504 --> 00:16:32,344
Could you

217
00:16:33,144 --> 00:16:34,303
let me join the battalion?

218
00:16:35,823 --> 00:16:36,663
He,

219
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:39,303
what are you muttering about alone here?

220
00:16:39,943 --> 00:16:41,423
Are you looking for extra training?

221
00:16:42,744 --> 00:16:43,864
Considering an apology.

222
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:45,384
Considering an apology?

223
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:48,984
Kneeling on this?

224
00:16:51,464 --> 00:16:52,903
This place is truly vast.

225
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:54,703
Thank you so much, young man.

226
00:16:55,744 --> 00:16:56,744
If I walked alone,

227
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,703
I'd likely get lost.

228
00:16:59,464 --> 00:17:00,304
(Miss He,)

229
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,024
(in your next life, avoid being
born into He family.)

230
00:17:10,744 --> 00:17:11,584
It's him.

231
00:17:18,464 --> 00:17:19,304
He.

232
00:17:19,863 --> 00:17:21,103
Not picking a weapon?

233
00:17:34,704 --> 00:17:35,544
Sir,

234
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:36,863
earlier,

235
00:17:36,863 --> 00:17:38,744
who was that person with you?

236
00:17:38,983 --> 00:17:40,663
The Yezhou Magistrate's man.

237
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:42,736
He delivered an invitation
to our Commander.

238
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:44,143
Thank you.

239
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:46,744
(Yezhou Magistrate's man?)

240
00:17:47,504 --> 00:17:48,344
(His severed finger)

241
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:49,463
(and his voice.)

242
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,703
(It's the man
who hurt me at Yuhua Temple.)

243
00:17:52,464 --> 00:17:53,823
(The He family's henchman.)

244
00:17:54,704 --> 00:17:56,664
(They infiltrated Yezhou Magistrate.)

245
00:17:57,224 --> 00:17:58,224
(What are they planning?)

246
00:18:00,184 --> 00:18:03,088
Yezhou Garrison faces shortages
in military funds and provisions.

247
00:18:03,184 --> 00:18:04,863
I feel deeply concerned.

248
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:08,103
We sincerely invite
Commander Xiao Jue of Yezhou Garrison

249
00:18:08,264 --> 00:18:09,343
for discussion.

250
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:12,823
I also hear your nephew Cheng Lisu
is currently at Yezhou Garrison.

251
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,464
Having not seen him for years,

252
00:18:15,504 --> 00:18:16,583
I feel nostalgic.

253
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,424
Hoping the Commander
will bring him along.

254
00:18:19,863 --> 00:18:22,063
(Invitation)
Yezhou Magistrate, Sun Xiangfu.

255
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,744
He's inviting you
for an official matter.

256
00:18:26,944 --> 00:18:27,784
Why include me?

257
00:18:28,103 --> 00:18:29,783
I have no old bonds to reminisce about.

258
00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:33,264
You don't remember?

259
00:18:38,815 --> 00:18:40,752
(Yezhou Magistrate, Sun Xiangfu)

260
00:18:43,303 --> 00:18:44,264
Sun Xiangfu!

261
00:18:46,103 --> 00:18:47,824
When he came to the capital years ago,

262
00:18:47,824 --> 00:18:49,543
his wife arranged a marriage for you.

263
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,383
Oh, no.

264
00:18:51,383 --> 00:18:53,224
He'll probably lure me there first,

265
00:18:53,543 --> 00:18:54,424
then detain me,

266
00:18:54,743 --> 00:18:56,664
and send me back
to Yaojing for marriage!

267
00:18:57,224 --> 00:18:58,064
This...

268
00:18:59,184 --> 00:19:00,024
Huaijin.

269
00:19:00,944 --> 00:19:01,784
Uncle.

270
00:19:01,904 --> 00:19:03,760
You have to save me.

271
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,224
You can't watch your best friend,

272
00:19:06,224 --> 00:19:07,264
your adorable nephew,

273
00:19:07,264 --> 00:19:08,383
jump into hellfire.

274
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:16,984
Is it that terrible?

275
00:19:17,383 --> 00:19:18,303
Absolutely.

276
00:19:18,744 --> 00:19:19,823
You know full well

277
00:19:20,184 --> 00:19:22,143
Miss Song and I despise each other.

278
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:23,583
She spends all day tinkering with

279
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:24,583
strange concoctions.

280
00:19:25,224 --> 00:19:26,543
I'll become her lab rat,

281
00:19:26,543 --> 00:19:28,184
slowly tortured to death.

282
00:19:28,704 --> 00:19:29,544
I'd rather

283
00:19:30,063 --> 00:19:31,504
end it all now!

284
00:19:31,623 --> 00:19:32,463
Wait.

285
00:19:32,943 --> 00:19:33,783
Uncle,

286
00:19:33,783 --> 00:19:35,343
I knew you wouldn't abandon me.

287
00:19:36,224 --> 00:19:37,224
Our bond is so strong.

288
00:19:39,783 --> 00:19:41,184
W-What...?

289
00:19:43,543 --> 00:19:44,944
What are you doing?

290
00:19:50,704 --> 00:19:52,063
Yinqiu is sharp.

291
00:19:53,383 --> 00:19:54,223
I'll lend it to you.

292
00:19:55,088 --> 00:19:57,623
You're joking?

293
00:19:58,184 --> 00:19:59,024
Uncle,

294
00:19:59,623 --> 00:20:02,863
you wouldn't really
let me die, would you?

295
00:20:06,823 --> 00:20:08,264
Don't you want to end it all?

296
00:20:08,863 --> 00:20:09,703
I...

297
00:20:10,303 --> 00:20:11,760
I was just kidding.

298
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:23,504
Mr. Cheng,

299
00:20:24,383 --> 00:20:26,424
I heard someone sent
the Commander an invitation.

300
00:20:27,103 --> 00:20:27,943
Mr. He,

301
00:20:28,063 --> 00:20:29,184
I'm going to die.

302
00:20:29,623 --> 00:20:30,463
When the time comes,

303
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:32,143
burn lots of joss paper for me.

304
00:20:32,823 --> 00:20:34,303
Mr. Cheng, what's wrong?

305
00:20:34,904 --> 00:20:36,103
I'm going with Huaijin

306
00:20:36,144 --> 00:20:38,583
to visit the Yezhou Magistrate.

307
00:20:38,984 --> 00:20:40,343
That's a dangerous place.

308
00:20:41,063 --> 00:20:41,944
Dangerous place?

309
00:20:42,303 --> 00:20:43,583
With the Commander, why fear?

310
00:20:44,024 --> 00:20:46,184
Unless in the magistrate's mansion,

311
00:20:46,543 --> 00:20:47,464
there are people

312
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:48,783
stronger than the Commander?

313
00:20:49,383 --> 00:20:51,464
Sun Xiangfu is more terrifying.

314
00:20:52,063 --> 00:20:53,784
His wife was my marriage matchmaker.

315
00:20:54,184 --> 00:20:55,024
This time,

316
00:20:55,264 --> 00:20:56,863
not even Xiao Jue can protect me.

317
00:20:58,783 --> 00:21:01,184
So the Commander is visiting Yezhou

318
00:21:01,184 --> 00:21:02,623
to discuss your marriage?

319
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:03,623
No.

320
00:21:03,744 --> 00:21:05,303
He is going for an official matter.

321
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,823
Only I must go through this.

322
00:21:08,543 --> 00:21:10,352
Official matter?

323
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,344
What is that?

324
00:21:11,344 --> 00:21:14,103
The Yezhou Magistrate wants
the Commander's personal presence?

325
00:21:14,184 --> 00:21:15,343
He's got some nerve.

326
00:21:16,103 --> 00:21:16,943
No.

327
00:21:17,024 --> 00:21:18,704
Huaijin is going
for provisions and funds.

328
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:19,943
I'm just...

329
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,223
Hold on, Mr. He.

330
00:21:21,623 --> 00:21:23,024
Why do you keep mentioning Huaijin?

331
00:21:23,424 --> 00:21:25,504
I'm the one in hot water, not him.

332
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:28,344
Mr. Cheng,

333
00:21:28,744 --> 00:21:30,664
I just thought he'd be capable enough.

334
00:21:30,984 --> 00:21:32,303
If you can't rely on him,

335
00:21:33,184 --> 00:21:34,464
let me help brainstorm ideas.

336
00:21:35,823 --> 00:21:36,663
Come on, let's go.

337
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:38,424
Let me think.

338
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,304
Commander,

339
00:21:40,823 --> 00:21:41,704
Sun Xiangfu has been

340
00:21:42,143 --> 00:21:44,024
dodging the funds and provisions issue,

341
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,552
but at this critical moment,

342
00:21:45,552 --> 00:21:46,584
he suddenly invites you.

343
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:47,744
It must be a trap.

344
00:21:47,824 --> 00:21:49,704
This is clearly an ambush banquet.

345
00:21:50,264 --> 00:21:51,104
Should we decline?

346
00:21:52,024 --> 00:21:52,864
If I don't go,

347
00:21:53,303 --> 00:21:54,543
they won't give up.

348
00:21:55,184 --> 00:21:56,664
A stab in the back is hard to dodge.

349
00:21:57,504 --> 00:21:58,623
We should strike first.

350
00:21:59,264 --> 00:22:00,104
Moreover,

351
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,184
doesn't Sun Xiangfu
still owe us for the provisions?

352
00:22:03,384 --> 00:22:04,224
Commander.

353
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:05,343
I've just received news.

354
00:22:05,704 --> 00:22:07,944
The Inspector
of the Ministry of War, Chu Zhao,

355
00:22:07,944 --> 00:22:08,863
is coming to Yezhou.

356
00:22:09,303 --> 00:22:10,664
I think you know this man.

357
00:22:10,783 --> 00:22:13,623
Top scholar in 19th Year of Qingyuan,
Xu Jingfu's prized disciple.

358
00:22:14,303 --> 00:22:16,543
He's been serving
Xu Jingfu all these years.

359
00:22:17,424 --> 00:22:18,264
I find he just

360
00:22:18,744 --> 00:22:19,944
returned from Que City.

361
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,183
Continue.

362
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:26,584
The Que City battle

363
00:22:26,664 --> 00:22:27,504
hurt your reputation.

364
00:22:27,823 --> 00:22:29,184
It's unclear if he's involved.

365
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:30,304
Now in Yezhou,

366
00:22:30,743 --> 00:22:32,504
his intentions here remain unknown.

367
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:34,504
I've dealt with Chu Zhao before.

368
00:22:35,303 --> 00:22:37,504
He suffered mistreatment
in his family initially

369
00:22:37,863 --> 00:22:38,904
until he earned his title,

370
00:22:39,783 --> 00:22:41,504
and then his family
changed their attitude.

371
00:22:42,144 --> 00:22:44,063
Now, he serves under Xu Jingfu.

372
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,184
Undoubtedly, he is using
Xu Jingfu's influence for advancement.

373
00:22:47,744 --> 00:22:49,103
Regardless of his true motives,

374
00:22:49,864 --> 00:22:52,264
he ultimately works for Xu Jingfu.

375
00:22:53,143 --> 00:22:53,984
What a coincidence.

376
00:22:54,904 --> 00:22:56,024
Returning from Que City.

377
00:22:57,224 --> 00:22:59,184
Those rumors must stem from him.

378
00:22:59,704 --> 00:23:00,863
During this Yezhou mission,

379
00:23:01,744 --> 00:23:02,863
stay vigilant against him.

380
00:23:03,024 --> 00:23:03,864
Yes.

381
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:04,744
Commander.

382
00:23:04,904 --> 00:23:06,103
This mission is dangerous.

383
00:23:06,464 --> 00:23:07,704
Mr. Cheng can't fight.

384
00:23:08,103 --> 00:23:08,943
Taking him along

385
00:23:09,143 --> 00:23:10,383
could be problematic.

386
00:23:10,984 --> 00:23:12,103
Cheng Lisu isn't going.

387
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:13,383
He Yan will go.

388
00:23:20,704 --> 00:23:21,544
What's wrong?

389
00:23:22,343 --> 00:23:23,183
No problem.

390
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:25,744
Commander, don't you doubt
He Yan's identity?

391
00:23:26,143 --> 00:23:27,744
Why bring him along then?

392
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:32,504
Leaving him here worries me.

393
00:23:32,984 --> 00:23:34,343
Since he's so eager to go,

394
00:23:35,184 --> 00:23:36,024
let him join me.

395
00:23:36,823 --> 00:23:38,063
He boasts of his skills.

396
00:23:38,704 --> 00:23:39,823
This banquet will test

397
00:23:40,704 --> 00:23:42,264
whether his claims hold true.

398
00:23:50,823 --> 00:23:52,184
(Sun Xiangfu has been withholding)

399
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,783
(the military provisions and funds,)

400
00:23:54,783 --> 00:23:57,464
(but now suddenly invites
Xiao Jue to negotiate.)

401
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,143
(He Rufei and Sun Xiangfu)

402
00:24:00,823 --> 00:24:02,063
(must be plotting something.)

403
00:24:02,783 --> 00:24:03,623
(Their target)

404
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:04,984
(is Yezhou Garrison,)

405
00:24:05,823 --> 00:24:07,063
(perhaps even Xiao Jue.)

406
00:24:09,464 --> 00:24:10,464
(This trip to Yezhou,)

407
00:24:11,143 --> 00:24:12,383
(whether for the garrison,)

408
00:24:12,664 --> 00:24:13,504
(Xiao Jue,)

409
00:24:13,783 --> 00:24:14,744
(or me,)

410
00:24:15,863 --> 00:24:18,184
(I must uncover the truth.)

411
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:39,383
Commander.

412
00:24:40,224 --> 00:24:41,064
You seem distracted.

413
00:24:41,783 --> 00:24:42,623
What troubles you?

414
00:24:43,504 --> 00:24:44,344
Commander,

415
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:45,984
I drank too much last night.

416
00:24:46,143 --> 00:24:47,024
Sorry

417
00:24:47,543 --> 00:24:48,383
for offending you.

418
00:24:48,584 --> 00:24:50,664
But must you stare at me like this?

419
00:24:50,984 --> 00:24:53,184
I've already thought of
a way to redeem myself.

420
00:24:53,944 --> 00:24:55,943
So you take Cheng Lisu's place
and go to Yezhou

421
00:24:56,303 --> 00:24:57,224
just to atone?

422
00:24:58,704 --> 00:24:59,863
Not entirely.

423
00:25:00,303 --> 00:25:01,543
Aside from easing your burdens,

424
00:25:02,103 --> 00:25:03,103
it's for my own sake.

425
00:25:03,904 --> 00:25:04,744
For yourself?

426
00:25:07,303 --> 00:25:09,463
I want to join the battalion
to make achievements.

427
00:25:09,783 --> 00:25:10,744
If this trip

428
00:25:10,783 --> 00:25:12,504
can make you change your opinion of me,

429
00:25:12,823 --> 00:25:13,663
then next time,

430
00:25:13,863 --> 00:25:15,024
the slot for the battalion

431
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:16,064
will be mine.

432
00:25:16,424 --> 00:25:17,823
Such a golden opportunity.

433
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:19,143
Of course I'll seize it.

434
00:25:24,863 --> 00:25:25,703
Good.

435
00:25:26,343 --> 00:25:27,424
Let's see

436
00:25:28,063 --> 00:25:29,504
how you'll change my opinion.

437
00:25:55,624 --> 00:25:56,464
Commander.

438
00:25:56,464 --> 00:25:57,304
Mr. Cheng.

439
00:25:57,424 --> 00:25:58,264
Mr. Feinu.

440
00:25:58,583 --> 00:25:59,423
Morning.

441
00:25:59,904 --> 00:26:00,744
Morning.

442
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:07,224
I am Cheng Lisu

443
00:26:07,543 --> 00:26:08,664
from the capital.

444
00:26:09,063 --> 00:26:10,823
I love mushroom and chicken stew,

445
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:11,944
hate congee,

446
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:14,224
avoid peanuts
and love cleanliness the most.

447
00:26:14,383 --> 00:26:16,303
I burn incense and bathe daily.

448
00:26:16,823 --> 00:26:17,663
Well done. Well done.

449
00:26:17,783 --> 00:26:18,863
You've memorized that well.

450
00:26:20,103 --> 00:26:22,143
As the saying goes,
clothes make the man.

451
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:25,383
This looks better.

452
00:26:29,743 --> 00:26:30,583
Mr. He,

453
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:31,823
your demeanor today

454
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:32,944
almost rivals mine.

455
00:26:33,504 --> 00:26:34,583
You flatter me.

456
00:26:36,103 --> 00:26:37,704
Commander, what do you think?

457
00:26:37,704 --> 00:26:38,744
Do I look

458
00:26:38,944 --> 00:26:41,744
charming and dashing?

459
00:26:42,464 --> 00:26:43,304
You're even

460
00:26:45,383 --> 00:26:46,623
shorter than Cheng Lisu.

461
00:26:49,383 --> 00:26:50,223
Who says that?

462
00:26:50,664 --> 00:26:51,504
About my height.

463
00:26:52,303 --> 00:26:53,143
When are you leaving?

464
00:27:01,904 --> 00:27:02,744
Go away.

465
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:13,584
(Yezhou City)

466
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:19,423
Young Master.

467
00:27:19,664 --> 00:27:21,664
Ding Yi has made contact
with Sun Xiangfu.

468
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,424
The invitation for Xiao Jue
to come to Yezhou City

469
00:27:24,783 --> 00:27:26,544
must now be in his hands.

470
00:27:26,863 --> 00:27:27,703
Good.

471
00:27:28,424 --> 00:27:29,264
Found anything

472
00:27:29,543 --> 00:27:30,383
about the Sun family?

473
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:31,944
As you instructed,

474
00:27:32,104 --> 00:27:34,143
we targeted Sun Xiangfu's useless son.

475
00:27:34,823 --> 00:27:35,744
Fruitful results.

476
00:27:36,143 --> 00:27:37,744
Sun Ling is a lecherous man,

477
00:27:37,944 --> 00:27:39,024
abusing his father's power

478
00:27:39,303 --> 00:27:41,463
to tyrannize Yezhou's citizens
and harass women.

479
00:27:41,704 --> 00:27:43,783
The people are afraid
to speak their anger openly.

480
00:27:44,103 --> 00:27:45,823
Sun Xiangfu is cautious
and stays in line,

481
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:47,504
but he is responsible

482
00:27:47,904 --> 00:27:48,744
for his son.

483
00:27:49,264 --> 00:27:50,984
His son will surely drag him down.

484
00:27:51,783 --> 00:27:52,623
Young Master.

485
00:27:52,664 --> 00:27:53,504
In that case,

486
00:27:53,744 --> 00:27:55,583
shouldn't we head
to the Sun residence now?

487
00:27:55,863 --> 00:27:57,303
The stage is set,

488
00:27:57,704 --> 00:27:59,583
and the actors will soon arrive.

489
00:28:00,424 --> 00:28:01,863
We'll move once they're here.

490
00:28:02,783 --> 00:28:03,704
Missing this chance

491
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:05,383
would be a shame.

492
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:23,583
Gentlemen,

493
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:24,744
please come inside.

494
00:28:30,024 --> 00:28:30,864
This way.

495
00:28:33,184 --> 00:28:34,024
Sir,

496
00:28:34,024 --> 00:28:34,864
please.

497
00:28:38,335 --> 00:28:43,248
(Guests Filling the Halls)

498
00:28:44,944 --> 00:28:45,784
Commander.

499
00:28:49,343 --> 00:28:50,183
Uncle.

500
00:28:50,184 --> 00:28:51,583
Why not stay at the Sun residence?

501
00:28:52,184 --> 00:28:53,024
No rush.

502
00:28:56,263 --> 00:28:58,063
How many rooms would you like?

503
00:28:58,464 --> 00:28:59,304
Three.

504
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:00,344
Two.

505
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:04,143
We two share a room.

506
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:06,343
Why should I share a room with you?

507
00:29:06,623 --> 00:29:07,463
Because...

508
00:29:09,543 --> 00:29:12,016
I'm your nephew.

509
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:14,143
You won't even pay for another room?

510
00:29:15,743 --> 00:29:16,583
Three rooms.

511
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:17,423
Alright.

512
00:29:18,984 --> 00:29:19,824
You...

513
00:29:19,904 --> 00:29:21,264
Don't leave your room tonight.

514
00:29:25,104 --> 00:29:25,944
Waiter.

515
00:29:25,944 --> 00:29:26,784
Coming.

516
00:29:27,904 --> 00:29:30,303
Do you serve
mushroom and chicken stew here?

517
00:29:30,343 --> 00:29:31,183
Yes.

518
00:29:31,543 --> 00:29:32,383
Bring us a portion.

519
00:29:32,383 --> 00:29:34,024
Uncle, you know well

520
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,424
how much I adore
mushroom and chicken stew.

521
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:39,704
Mushroom and chicken stew,

522
00:29:40,103 --> 00:29:41,103
Eight-Treasure Duck,

523
00:29:41,343 --> 00:29:42,543
vegetables, soup,

524
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:43,623
and six steamed buns.

525
00:29:44,343 --> 00:29:45,183
Okay.

526
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,504
(Just having one more room)

527
00:29:47,543 --> 00:29:48,664
(and ordering one dish)

528
00:29:49,143 --> 00:29:51,024
(deserves those judgmental looks?)

529
00:29:51,383 --> 00:29:52,704
(So stingy.)

530
00:29:53,984 --> 00:29:54,824
Wait.

531
00:29:55,783 --> 00:29:56,704
I'll have

532
00:29:57,063 --> 00:29:59,103
spicy tripe strips, sesame rolls,

533
00:29:59,103 --> 00:30:01,583
shredded chicken with cucumber,
five-flavored steamed gluten,

534
00:30:01,584 --> 00:30:02,583
aromatic young pigeon,

535
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:04,464
and also that

536
00:30:05,143 --> 00:30:06,224
mung bean dough noodles.

537
00:30:06,224 --> 00:30:07,823
Yes, all of them.

538
00:30:07,823 --> 00:30:09,223
- Okay.
- Can you finish all this?

539
00:30:13,744 --> 00:30:14,584
Uncle,

540
00:30:15,103 --> 00:30:16,623
you wouldn't let your nephew

541
00:30:16,823 --> 00:30:17,984
go hungry, would you?

542
00:30:22,783 --> 00:30:23,783
Serve what he ordered.

543
00:30:24,264 --> 00:30:25,104
Alright.

544
00:30:43,504 --> 00:30:44,344
Enjoy your meal.

545
00:30:45,823 --> 00:30:47,248
Since these are your favorite food,

546
00:30:47,744 --> 00:30:49,343
I naturally let you eat them.

547
00:30:50,024 --> 00:30:51,184
But I taught you this.

548
00:30:51,623 --> 00:30:52,583
Save and thrive,

549
00:30:53,024 --> 00:30:53,984
waste and perish.

550
00:30:55,024 --> 00:30:55,984
Don't waste anything.

551
00:31:01,504 --> 00:31:03,024
(I've really overdone it now.)

552
00:31:28,543 --> 00:31:30,863
I'm stuffed!

553
00:31:31,863 --> 00:31:33,872
Now that I'm full, I'm getting drowsy.

554
00:31:33,872 --> 00:31:36,264
This bed is amazingly comfortable!

555
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:41,543
I'll definitely sleep well.

556
00:31:42,464 --> 00:31:44,264
He eats well and sleeps soundly.

557
00:31:44,823 --> 00:31:47,303
If you're still energetic,
play chess with me.

558
00:32:19,863 --> 00:32:20,703
Commander,

559
00:32:20,783 --> 00:32:21,783
really playing chess?

560
00:32:22,424 --> 00:32:23,264
But I...

561
00:32:28,984 --> 00:32:30,543
Yezhou City has unexpected people.

562
00:32:31,224 --> 00:32:32,264
This is getting exciting.

563
00:32:32,783 --> 00:32:34,143
Investigate the Sun family again.

564
00:32:34,623 --> 00:32:36,464
Find their recent tax records.

565
00:32:36,944 --> 00:32:38,424
Let's see how Sun Xiangfu

566
00:32:39,103 --> 00:32:40,823
claims military provisions are lacking

567
00:32:41,024 --> 00:32:42,264
and he can't allocate rations.

568
00:32:43,024 --> 00:32:43,864
Yes.

569
00:32:44,783 --> 00:32:45,623
Commander,

570
00:32:45,984 --> 00:32:46,824
what about He Yan?

571
00:32:47,224 --> 00:32:48,343
I'll keep watch personally.

572
00:33:19,745 --> 00:33:21,903
♪Light shines upon my heart♪

573
00:33:22,007 --> 00:33:25,927
♪Unveiling scars,
