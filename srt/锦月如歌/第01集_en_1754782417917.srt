Being a person's substitute for a long time,

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,520
will you forget

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,760
who you are?

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,800
They call me He Rufei.

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,600
Kneel.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,880
The eldest son of the He family.

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,560
Since I was a child,

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,800
I was always dressed as a boy.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,400
I was always wearing a mask.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,040
They say

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,680
life is silent and silent.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,160
Death is silent and silent.

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,400
I hated it.

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,240
Remember.

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,600
But I was also lucky.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,760
This cold mask

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,440
killed me.

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,120
But it also saved me.

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,200
The war was put out.

21
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,000
I lost my body and blood.

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,200
I forgot my life.

23
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,200
I don't need to think about

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,840
who I was

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,800
when the mask scared me.

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,680
I was a nobody

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,360
who was killed by the King.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,080
But in the end,

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,200
who was General Fei Hong?

30
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,760
Who was I?

The general of the Xiao family

34
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,720
General Xiao Zhongwu

35
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,440
led the army to fight the enemy.

36
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,000
But in the final battle of Mingshui,

37
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,360
30,000 Xiao family

38
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,280
were ambushed.

39
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,840
Xiao Zhongwu.

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,280
The He Yue Army of He Rufei

41
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,400
is coming.

42
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,920
You just surrender.

43
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,560
We spare your life.

44
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,080
He Rufei

45
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,360
will definitely come.

46
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,440
Our great Quelium soldier

47
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,680
is into this.

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,520
Go.

49
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,720
We can't fight.

50
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,240
Arrows of fate.

51
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,780
It's hard to

52
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,320
one Chu

53
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,320
General Xiu!

54
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
General Xiu!

55
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
General Xiu!

56
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
Father!

57
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,320
He Ruofei!

58
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,320
The water in the garden is only 100 li.

59
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
Why is your old spirit only here now?

60
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
The water is low and the wood is broken.

61
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
One day,

62
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,320
you two will be the twin stars of our Great Wei.

63
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,920
You will be in the same boat.

64
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,320
You will be in the same boat.

65
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
We will be together,

66
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,320
protecting the people and the country.

67
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,320
You are not worthy of the Qin Lang Sword that father gave you.

68
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,320
General Bei Hong is the first!

69
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,320
General Bei Hong!

70
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,320
All of you, General Bei Hong!

71
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,320
Young Master, Master invites you to the study.

72
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,320
Ermao!

73
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Young Master!

74
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
Young Master!

75
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,320
Young Master!

76
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
Young Master!

77
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
Young Master!

78
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,320
Young Master!

79
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
Ermao!

80
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
Madam,

81
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
you are here.

82
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,320
Go and see Miss.

83
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,320
I am sorry.

84
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,320
Young Master is the only one in the house.

85
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
Miss

86
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,320
is recuperating in the Imperial Academy.

87
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,320
Sit.

88
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,320
Yan'er,

89
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,320
you have been in the Li family for many years.

90
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,320
You have been in the military camp for many years.

91
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
Thank you.

92
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,320
Father,

93
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
I am not suffering at all.

94
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,320
I am happy that I can be of great help to the He family.

95
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Yan'er,

96
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,320
it is good that you are back.

97
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
I am glad that you are back.

98
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
Father,

99
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
it is good that you are back.

100
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
It is good that you are back.

101
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,320
A girl's family is not a good family.

102
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,320
It is not a good family.

103
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
It is a man's business

104
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,320
to just have a family.

105
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
Now that you are back,

106
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,320
it is good that you can also

107
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,320
change your daughter's identity.

108
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Don't worry about the position of the He family.

109
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,320
I have my own way.

110
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
Way?

111
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
What way?

112
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,320
You have been in the He family for so many years.

113
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,320
It is really hard.

114
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,320
I will leave all these things to you.

115
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,320
This is your brother, He Rufei,

116
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,320
whom you have never met.

117
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
When you were three years old,

118
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
you went to the He family with your mother.

119
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,320
He was weak and had been in the Imperial Palace for treatment.

120
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,320
This is what made you replace him.

121
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
Now that your brother is well,

122
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
he is back home.

123
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,320
You brothers are back to your own places.

124
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
We are all here to help you.

125
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
It is good that you are back to your own places.

126
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
The He family can also

127
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,320
pass the matter of having a daughter as a son.

128
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
Father,

129
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
this is your way.

130
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
Yan'er,

131
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
you have to think for your family.

132
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,320
Our He family is also a great leader in the world.

133
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
The leader of the cultural forum.

134
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,320
Now, the Qiwen has been in the military.

135
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
Father,

136
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,320
it is because I don't want to disappoint you,

137
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,320
and I don't want to humiliate the He family,

138
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
that I have been working hard to build a great career.

139
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
I hope that one day,

140
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,320
I can become a hero like General Xiao.

141
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
You want to become Xiao Zhongwu?

142
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Xiao Zhongwu is a sinner in the Wei State.

143
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,320
It is because he has made great contributions to the country,

144
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,320
and is poor and alone.

145
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
In the eyes of the soldiers,

146
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
protecting the people,

147
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,320
and protecting the people.

148
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,320
This is what General Xiao taught me.

149
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,320
I don't believe that he is a poor soldier who is alone.

150
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
I will go to the court tomorrow.

151
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
I will definitely be loyal to General Xiao.

152
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
Even if I give up all the military achievements,

153
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
I will not give up.

154
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,320
In the battle of Ming Shui,

155
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,320
the soldiers of the Wei State lost more than 30,000 people.

156
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,320
The leader, Xiao Zhongwu, is hard to say goodbye.

157
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,320
Now, the Xiao family has entered the funeral with the rites of the people.

158
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,700
The

159
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,320
only thing left is the power of the Xiao family to lead the army.

160
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,320
The result is...

161
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
Your Majesty,

162
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,320
my father is definitely not a poor soldier who is alone.

163
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,320
We have already set up ambushes in all places in the Ming Shui Valley.

164
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,320
But in the battle of the time,

165
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,320
the Wutuosha

166
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,320
had already destroyed the ambushes in all places.

167
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,320
Someone must have leaked military information.

168
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
I beg Your Majesty to reconsider this case.

169
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,320
Return my father,

170
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,320
return the soldiers of the Xiao family,

171
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
justice.

172
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
Your Majesty has the decree.

173
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Summon General Fei Hong and He Rufei to the hall.

174
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,320
I, He Rufei,

175
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
greet Your Majesty.

176
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,320
Rise.

177
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

178
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
He Aiqing,

179
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
in the battle of the Ming Shui,

180
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
the Xiao family lost more than 30,000 people.

181
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
Are there any hidden messages?

182
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Replying to Your Majesty,

183
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
in the battle of the Ming Shui,

184
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
the Xiao family lost more than 30,000 people.

185
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,320
What is the secret?

186
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
I have already said it.

187
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
In the battle of the Ming Shui,

188
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
there is no hidden message.

189
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,320
If General Xiao didn't make great contributions,

190
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,320
and insisted on fighting against the Wutuosha,

191
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,320
and also refused to ask for help from our Fuyue Army,

192
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,320
how could it be so tragic?

193
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
He Rufei.

194
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,320
General Feng Yun,

195
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,320
I have told you many times.

196
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
But you, in order to make your father feel guilty,

197
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
turned the dark and white,

198
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
and burned him to death.

199
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
But when I received the rescue letter,

200
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
I immediately sent troops to rescue him.

201
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
I didn't dare to wait for a moment.

202
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,320
He Rufei.

203
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,320
Long time no see.

204
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
How did you become like this?

205
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,320
No!

206
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,320
You still want to be a criminal?

207
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,320
I think you want to drag the whole family to die for you.

208
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
You can use your father's handwriting and actions to make a fool of me.

209
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
I have a lot of magic tricks.

210
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,320
Magic tricks?

211
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,320
Since you don't want to change your identity,

212
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
I will wait for you to tell me.

213
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,320
You have sacrificed so much for your brother.

214
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
It must be hard for you.

215
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,320
You have to let your brother

216
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,320
thank you for the tea.

217
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,320
General Feng Yun lost his memory.

218
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,320
But,

219
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,320
His Majesty thinks of the past military achievements of the Xiao family.

220
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,320
Xiao Cheng's great achievement is twenty.

221
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,320
He is also the most prestigious person in the palace.

222
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,320
He has passed by himself.

223
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,320
Kill!

224
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,320
Kill!

225
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
Your Majesty.

226
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,320
I know my mistake.

227
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,320
I will lead the troops to Que City.

228
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
I will take back my brother.

229
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,320
I will atone for my crime.

230
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,320
His Majesty signed the military order for the whole family.

231
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
He will not take back the city.

232
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
He will not return the city.

233
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
General Feng Yun.

234
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,320
His Majesty's order is as you wish.

235
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

236
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,320
But the soldiers of the Wei State

237
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,320
must not die in vain.

238
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
Xiao Jue.

239
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,320
The army will not send a single army.

240
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
How to take back the city?

241
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,320
Think of a way yourself.

242
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,320
I will take back the city.

243
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

244
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,320
Although I will not take back the city,

245
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,320
I must take back the wish.

246
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,320
Sister.

247
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,320
Sister.

248
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
Come with me to Yue Ji.

249
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
Okay.

250
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,320
Be careful.

251
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,320
Sister, we are going down the stairs.

252
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
Fifty-nine.

253
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,320
Sixty.

254
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,320
Sixty-one.

255
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Sister, you are so good.

256
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,320
You are so different from the people of the Lai Si.

257
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,320
Yixin.

258
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,320
Turn right.

259
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,320
Then go straight.

260
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,320
Are we at the back wall?

261
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,320
Yes, it is the back wall.

262
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,320
Outside is the path I secretly went down the mountain.

263
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,320
After a day, I left the Yuhua Temple.

264
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,320
Then you take me to take a walk.

265
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,320
Okay.

266
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,320
Father left him a life for his relatives.

267
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,320
But even if he was blind,

268
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,320
it was still a disaster.

269
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
I will send people to the Yuhua Temple.

270
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,320
You go and keep an eye on them.

271
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,320
I will send Miss He and the people who are sick out.

272
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,320
Then...

273
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,320
I will take care of it.

274
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,320
Go sixty-one steps from the kitchen to the bridge.

275
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
After the bridge,

276
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,320
go seven steps forward.

277
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
That is the moon well near the river.

278
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,320
You need to turn right.

279
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,320
Did I sell it wrong today?

280
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,320
Or did I count wrong?

281
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,320
I will go to the bridge.

282
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
I will go to the bridge.

283
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
I will go to the bridge.

284
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
I will go to the bridge.

285
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
I will go to the bridge.

286
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
I will go to the bridge.

287
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
I will go to the bridge.

288
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
I will go to the bridge.

289
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,320
I will go to the bridge.

290
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,320
I will go to the bridge.

291
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
I will go to the bridge.

292
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
I will go to the bridge.

293
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
I will go to the bridge.

294
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,320
I will go to the bridge.

295
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,320
Who are you?

296
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,320
Please forgive me.

297
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,320
I am a guest from the Lai Temple.

298
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
I have no intention to be rude.

299
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,320
The back yard of the Yuhua Temple is in the northwest corner.

300
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,320
The guest's room should be in the east.

301
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,320
It seems that you suspect that I have bad intentions.

302
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
If you are willing to die,

303
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,320
why would you care about my family?

304
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,320
I am a mother.

305
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,320
I will die.

306
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
I will die.

307
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
I will die.

308
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
If you go one step further,

309
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
you will be a river.

310
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
If you are so kind,

311
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,320
you will be a blessing to your parents.

312
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,320
Even if you take this step,

313
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,320
I will not stop you.

314
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,320
Blessing to my parents?

315
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,320
They don't even give me a chance to speak.

316
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,320
If that is the case,

317
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,320
I will decide my fate.

318
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,320
People are desperate.

319
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,320
It is easier to die than to live.

320
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
If you are really strong,

321
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,320
it doesn't matter if you are blind.

322
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
Even if you are blind,

323
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,320
you should be the most different one among the blind.

324
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,320
Give me your hand.

325
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
This is a osmanthus candy.

326
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,320
It is the last one in the world.

327
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
Although it cannot be eaten,

328
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,320
it is really sweet.

329
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,320
You will know if it is sweet after eating it.

330
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,320
This candy is a little bitter when you swallow it.

331
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,320
But it is still sweet in your heart.

332
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,320
Is the moon of tonight beautiful?

333
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
The moon is like frost.

334
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,320
The wind is like water.

335
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,320
The moon is like water.

336
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,320
I have made a plan.

337
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,320
I plan to create a big girl who is in the Yuhua Temple.

338
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
Xiao Jue was dragged by Xiao Jue

339
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,320
when she died in the water accident.

340
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
She didn't fall into the river.

341
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,320
Why did Xiao Jue appear there?

342
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,320
No one can save that girl.

343
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,320
Let her escape

344
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,320
and die on the road to the prison.

345
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,320
The road that I secretly went down

346
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,320
is outside.

347
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,320
After a while,

348
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
I left the Yuhua Temple.

349
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,560
How is there any way around now?

350
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,320
There is only one way.

351
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,000
One

352
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,720
Lady

353
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,520
Shall I show my nobility to her?

354
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,760
You don't have to be a heat lead girl yourself.

355
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:38,480
It's about the

356
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,480
The Long Ballad

357
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,480
I can see it now.

358
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,040
Where am I?

359
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
I'm here.

360
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
I'm here.

361
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,480
I'm here.

362
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,480
I'm here.

363
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,480
I'm here.

364
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,480
I'm here.

365
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,480
Am I dead?

366
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,480
I finally managed to pull you back from the Ghost Gate.

367
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,480
I cured your eyes.

368
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
You shouldn't be keeping them.

369
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
Why are you doing this?

370
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
Master.

371
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,480
Last time I saw your weakness,

372
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,480
it was when I rescued you from the blood of the war,

373
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,480
how did I end up like this?

374
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,480
I thought I could escape from the Heaven.

375
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,480
But I was wrong.

376
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,480
They didn't stop me from talking.

377
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,480
They wanted me to never be able to talk again.

378
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,480
Your family is so cruel.

379
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,480
They are so cruel.

380
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,480
Master,

381
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,480
the news in the Imperial Court is so dark.

382
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,480
I wonder how the Xiao family is doing.

383
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,480
Did you wash the grudge against General Xiao?

384
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:46,760
The court has been

385
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,480
speaking ill of Xiao Zhongwu.

386
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,480
His Majesty has not yet determined his punishment

387
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,480
and almost seized the power of the Xiao Army.

388
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,480
How could this be?

389
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,480
His Majesty didn't even investigate?

390
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,480
General Feng Yun,

391
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,480
we are in the same army.

392
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,480
The reason for this is because the rescue came late.

393
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,480
My father and the Xiao Army are old.

394
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,480
They died for nothing.

395
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,480
I received the rescue letter

396
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,480
and immediately went to rescue the army.

397
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,480
I didn't dare to wait.

398
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,480
If I hadn't rebelled against the wild,

399
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,480
the Uto's cavalry would have been here long ago.

400
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
And General Fei Hong,

401
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
who is an accomplice,

402
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,480
he is a witness.

403
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,480
He is sure of Xiao Zhongwu's crime.

404
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,480
He has such an important witness.

405
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,480
Why would he investigate?

406
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,480
He Rongfei,

407
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,480
it was you who didn't come to rescue the army.

408
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
My father

409
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,480
and the soldiers of the Xiao Army

410
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,480
died in the battle.

411
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,480
The young soldiers

412
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,480
and the guards of the army

413
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,480
are all dead.

414
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,480
It's been years.

415
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,480
How did you become like this?

416
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,480
My father.

417
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,480
Take off your mask.

418
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,480
Cut off the future of the He family.

419
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,480
From now on,

420
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,480
I am just He Yan.

421
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,480
The sky is high and the sea is vast.

422
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,480
I am no longer anyone's substitute.

423
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,480
He Rongfei took General Fei Hong from me.

424
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,480
He ruined my life.

425
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,480
I will not let him be as he wishes.

426
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,480
He Rongfei,

427
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,480
I want to re-enter the camp.

428
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,480
I want to take back everything that belongs to me

429
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,480
with such great light.

430
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Five.

431
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,480

432
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,480
