But I promise you.

Soon,

25
00:01:47,765 --> 00:01:49,244
you'll be more regretful.

26
00:01:53,565 --> 00:01:54,244
Rufei.

27
00:01:55,045 --> 00:01:56,004
Don't think

28
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:58,004
becoming Marquis Wu'an

29
00:01:58,045 --> 00:01:59,685
makes you invincible.

30
00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:02,444
I killed you once,

31
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:05,325
and I can kill you again.

32
00:02:12,644 --> 00:02:14,005
Killing trash like you

33
00:02:14,124 --> 00:02:15,644
isn't worth dirtying my sword.

34
00:02:16,084 --> 00:02:17,605
S-Stop...

35
00:02:20,524 --> 00:02:21,205
Since childhood,

36
00:02:21,804 --> 00:02:22,445
I've shouldered

37
00:02:22,524 --> 00:02:24,084
the family heir's responsibilities.

38
00:02:24,524 --> 00:02:25,445
I earned glory

39
00:02:25,804 --> 00:02:27,244
and the title of General Feihong

40
00:02:27,804 --> 00:02:29,285
to bring glory to our family,

41
00:02:29,725 --> 00:02:30,725
but I never imagined

42
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:31,925
I'd nearly die

43
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,205
by my own brother's hand.

44
00:02:37,045 --> 00:02:37,725
Master He,

45
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:40,124
when you heard of He Yan's death,

46
00:02:40,524 --> 00:02:41,964
what did you feel?

47
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:43,644
Bitter tears of grief

48
00:02:44,084 --> 00:02:45,564
or a wave of relief?

49
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:47,964
This is

50
00:02:48,244 --> 00:02:49,605
our mansion.

51
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:52,804
How dare you act recklessly here!

52
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:56,445
Since you said so,

53
00:02:56,964 --> 00:02:58,524
if I don't make some trouble,

54
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,244
it'd be impolite.

55
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:01,844
What exactly do you want?

56
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:12,684
I am

57
00:03:13,124 --> 00:03:15,925
very curious.

58
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:19,964
Who exactly

59
00:03:20,524 --> 00:03:21,765
are you referring to?

60
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,205
Second only to the Emperor

61
00:03:26,684 --> 00:03:27,925
and above all others.

62
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:31,084
Who else could stir such chaos

63
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:35,445
besides you,

64
00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:37,925
Chancellor Xu?

65
00:03:47,364 --> 00:03:50,124
Well played, General Xiao.

66
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:51,925
With just a few words,

67
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:55,165
you've slung mud at me

68
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,244
and General He.

69
00:03:58,564 --> 00:03:59,644
Where's your proof?

70
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:01,485
Surely not just

71
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:04,325
your baseless accusations?

72
00:04:07,005 --> 00:04:08,244
No need to panic, Chancellor.

73
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:10,925
How could you be certain

74
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:12,684
we lack evidence?

75
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:37,564
Taotao's drug

76
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:39,285
actually works pretty well.

77
00:04:55,364 --> 00:04:56,884
(Just like when I lived here before.)

78
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:58,605
(Almost nothing's changed.)

79
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:40,004
Guards!

80
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:41,444
Guards!

81
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:43,004
Get in here now!

82
00:05:44,324 --> 00:05:44,845
Young Master.

83
00:05:44,884 --> 00:05:45,364
Master.

84
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:46,045
Master.

85
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:48,845
Untie me.

86
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:51,244
Move!

87
00:05:52,324 --> 00:05:52,965
Where's He Yan?

88
00:05:53,564 --> 00:05:54,405
What are you doing?

89
00:05:54,965 --> 00:05:55,965
Find He Yan immediately!

90
00:05:59,045 --> 00:05:59,684
Rufei.

91
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:01,204
Rufei!

92
00:06:01,965 --> 00:06:02,444
Master.

93
00:07:01,364 --> 00:07:02,085
The Linglong Box.

94
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:03,485
Long time no see.

95
00:07:05,364 --> 00:07:05,925
Guards!

96
00:07:06,605 --> 00:07:07,165
Guards!

97
00:07:08,364 --> 00:07:09,004
Guards!

98
00:07:11,204 --> 00:07:12,324
Chaos finally erupts.

99
00:07:13,324 --> 00:07:14,244
Seal off

100
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:15,324
the entire room.

101
00:07:15,324 --> 00:07:16,245
Don't let her escape!

102
00:07:16,525 --> 00:07:17,165
- Yes!
- Yes!

103
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:20,605
They arrived faster

104
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:21,364
than I expected.

105
00:07:22,165 --> 00:07:22,925
Good.

106
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:37,725
She's after

107
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:39,045
my letters with Chancellor Xu.

108
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,564
(You won't leave alive.)

109
00:07:43,124 --> 00:07:44,204
Quick! Guards!

110
00:07:45,324 --> 00:07:46,004
Keep searching!

111
00:07:46,085 --> 00:07:46,405
Yes!

112
00:07:46,645 --> 00:07:47,285
Check this area.

113
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:48,004
Yes.

114
00:07:48,444 --> 00:07:49,045
Any traces?

115
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:49,925
Nothing.

116
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:50,925
Keep looking.

117
00:07:51,124 --> 00:07:51,884
This area, too.

118
00:08:02,204 --> 00:08:02,645
Sir.

119
00:08:02,884 --> 00:08:03,605
Why are you here?

120
00:08:04,645 --> 00:08:05,204
For Sun Ling.

121
00:08:05,645 --> 00:08:06,124
Sir.

122
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,925
This death row inmate is involved in

123
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:09,165
a case supervised

124
00:08:09,204 --> 00:08:10,364
by the Ministry of Justice.

125
00:08:11,485 --> 00:08:12,085
Not long ago,

126
00:08:12,684 --> 00:08:14,525
he was transferred
from Yezhou for trial,

127
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:15,725
waiting to be killed.

128
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:17,804
The higher-ups
ordered strict supervision.

129
00:08:18,324 --> 00:08:19,165
Without a reason...

130
00:08:20,845 --> 00:08:22,564
It's you, Mr. Chu.

131
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:24,285
This way, sir.

132
00:08:24,444 --> 00:08:25,124
After you.

133
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:28,085
Right this way.

134
00:08:34,844 --> 00:08:35,604
Please enter, sir.

135
00:08:44,484 --> 00:08:45,245
You may leave now.

136
00:08:45,645 --> 00:08:46,084
Yes.

137
00:08:49,604 --> 00:08:50,165
Sun Ling.

138
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:56,684
You...

139
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:58,245
You are...

140
00:09:00,204 --> 00:09:01,844
C-Chu Zhao?

141
00:09:02,684 --> 00:09:03,285
It's me.

142
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:04,365
You...

143
00:09:04,604 --> 00:09:05,285
Why are you here?

144
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,204
You're behind bars

145
00:09:07,684 --> 00:09:08,684
and to be executed soon.

146
00:09:10,564 --> 00:09:11,245
I...

147
00:09:11,645 --> 00:09:12,285
I want to live!

148
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:13,484
I want to live!

149
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:14,604
Mr. Chu!

150
00:09:15,005 --> 00:09:15,604
Mr. Chu!

151
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:16,525
I want to live!

152
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:17,365
Save me!

153
00:09:17,484 --> 00:09:18,804
Save me! I don't want to die!

154
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:20,084
Your crime is grave.

155
00:09:20,844 --> 00:09:22,005
No one can save you.

156
00:09:24,084 --> 00:09:24,684
But...

157
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,285
But?

158
00:09:26,925 --> 00:09:27,484
But what?

159
00:09:27,925 --> 00:09:28,724
I can let you

160
00:09:29,564 --> 00:09:30,564
avenge your father

161
00:09:31,365 --> 00:09:32,684
while still breathing.

162
00:09:32,684 --> 00:09:33,736
(Account Book)

163
00:09:35,564 --> 00:09:36,564
This...

164
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:37,525
This is the ledger

165
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:39,405
of my father's transactions

166
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:40,925
with Xu Jingfu!

167
00:09:41,444 --> 00:09:42,844
H-How did this end up with you?

168
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:45,724
Correct.

169
00:09:46,165 --> 00:09:47,365
Your father worked diligently

170
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:48,804
to embezzle money for him,

171
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:51,045
only to be sacrificed as a scapegoat.

172
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:52,804
Dragging your entire family down.

173
00:09:53,925 --> 00:09:55,125
Quite tragic.

174
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:01,564
Stop the false compassion.

175
00:10:04,245 --> 00:10:05,525
You're partly responsible for

176
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:07,564
my father's death.

177
00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:12,964
But

178
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:14,925
(Account Book)
that old fox Xu Jingfu

179
00:10:15,285 --> 00:10:16,125
is the real culprit

180
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:18,084
who destroyed my family!

181
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,484
My father cherished me dearly.

182
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:23,005
How could I not avenge him?

183
00:10:25,768 --> 00:10:27,336
(Transactions)

184
00:10:29,765 --> 00:10:30,365
Tell me.

185
00:10:31,285 --> 00:10:32,245
What should I do?

186
00:10:36,964 --> 00:10:38,844
I want you to surrender this ledger

187
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:41,125
and expose

188
00:10:41,804 --> 00:10:43,444
Xu Jingfu's corruption and bribery.

189
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:58,684
Officially,

190
00:10:59,564 --> 00:11:00,765
I was never here today.

191
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:02,765
Correct?

192
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:04,804
Yes.

193
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:06,804
Yes.

194
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,285
Father.

195
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:51,484
Yan.

196
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:53,005
Mother...

197
00:12:09,576 --> 00:12:13,285
(Spirit Tablet of Daughter He Yan)

198
00:12:13,285 --> 00:12:14,964
(She burns incense, chants scriptures)

199
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:16,324
(and prays)

200
00:12:17,245 --> 00:12:18,045
(for me daily.)

201
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:21,844
(So in this mansion,)

202
00:12:22,964 --> 00:12:24,604
(there's still someone
who remembers me,)

203
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:27,765
(remembers He Yan.)

204
00:12:32,324 --> 00:12:32,804
Madam He.

205
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:34,645
Is anyone in the shrine?

206
00:12:36,765 --> 00:12:38,125
Don't disturb my prayers.

207
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,165
All of you, out!

208
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:40,925
- Yes!
- Yes!

209
00:12:43,165 --> 00:12:43,765
Quickly.

210
00:12:44,245 --> 00:12:44,844
Leave!

211
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:47,604
Go now!

212
00:12:48,005 --> 00:12:48,684
Hurry!

213
00:12:49,324 --> 00:12:50,125
Go!

214
00:12:59,964 --> 00:13:00,484
Anything?

215
00:13:00,964 --> 00:13:01,724
Nothing.

216
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:03,005
Found her?

217
00:13:03,204 --> 00:13:03,964
- No.
- No.

218
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:06,765
Rufei.

219
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:10,604
What is

220
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,484
all this commotion about?

221
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:13,525
Madam.

222
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:14,844
Did you happen to

223
00:13:14,844 --> 00:13:15,885
see anyone earlier?

224
00:13:17,444 --> 00:13:18,365
I haven't seen anyone.

225
00:13:35,804 --> 00:13:36,365
Rufei.

226
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:40,765
Rufei.

227
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,584
(Spirit Tablet of Daughter He Yan)

228
00:14:04,324 --> 00:14:05,005
Rufei.

229
00:14:10,804 --> 00:14:11,525
Rufei.

230
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:19,005
Rufei, don't be like this.

231
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:20,645
This is your sister's tablet.

232
00:14:21,084 --> 00:14:21,444
Don't.

233
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:22,005
Let go!

234
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:24,645
Rufei.

235
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,084
You let her escape.

236
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:29,724
Is that so?

237
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:50,405
Enough.

238
00:14:50,964 --> 00:14:52,724
We've had enough tea.

239
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,005
General Xiao.

240
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:56,564
Since you intend to fabricate evidence

241
00:14:56,885 --> 00:14:58,285
to frame me,

242
00:14:59,084 --> 00:15:00,525
then go ahead quickly.

243
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:03,525
My lord,

244
00:15:03,885 --> 00:15:04,444
Mr. Xiao's man

245
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:05,204
is outside,

246
00:15:05,444 --> 00:15:05,925
saying

247
00:15:05,925 --> 00:15:06,964
to report something.

248
00:15:07,885 --> 00:15:08,484
Chancellor,

249
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:10,604
my guard carries no weapons.

250
00:15:11,405 --> 00:15:12,844
Surely you won't obstruct him?

251
00:15:13,525 --> 00:15:15,084
You jest, General Xiao.

252
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,084
Do you recognize this Linglong Box?

253
00:15:51,564 --> 00:15:52,125
Of course.

254
00:15:52,804 --> 00:15:53,885
After all, His Majesty

255
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,204
publicly bestowed it
upon General Feihong.

256
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:57,925
You

257
00:15:58,604 --> 00:15:59,484
surely remember.

258
00:16:03,564 --> 00:16:05,005
This is General He's stuff.

259
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:07,285
How did this end up in your hands?

260
00:16:08,405 --> 00:16:09,604
Wasn't it you

261
00:16:10,765 --> 00:16:12,324
who told us to search for evidence?

262
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:16,084
He Yan happened to be

263
00:16:17,084 --> 00:16:18,444
at the He Mansion today

264
00:16:18,925 --> 00:16:20,964
and retrieved her Linglong Box.

265
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:23,165
This box contains

266
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:24,765
intricate mechanisms,

267
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,484
perfect for concealing important items.

268
00:16:29,444 --> 00:16:31,165
He Rufei thought the same,

269
00:16:32,724 --> 00:16:33,444
believing

270
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,804
by keeping

271
00:16:35,804 --> 00:16:37,005
certain life-saving evidence

272
00:16:37,684 --> 00:16:38,604
in here,

273
00:16:39,844 --> 00:16:41,324
he could rest easy.

274
00:16:42,444 --> 00:16:43,245
Unluckily,

275
00:16:44,005 --> 00:16:45,684
it still fell into our hands.

276
00:16:46,564 --> 00:16:47,604
Send him out.

277
00:17:16,405 --> 00:17:16,925
Today,

278
00:17:17,284 --> 00:17:18,524
He Yan came to my residence,

279
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,365
attempting to steal

280
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:22,645
our letters.

281
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:25,645
What a pity.

282
00:17:25,964 --> 00:17:26,845
Her schemes

283
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,845
still failed.

284
00:17:30,085 --> 00:17:31,244
I never expected

285
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:32,764
to find anything here.

286
00:17:33,565 --> 00:17:35,085
I got back this box

287
00:17:35,484 --> 00:17:36,244
simply because it

288
00:17:36,684 --> 00:17:37,805
belonged to

289
00:17:37,885 --> 00:17:38,925
General Feihong.

290
00:17:39,645 --> 00:17:40,325
Seeing this,

291
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,524
Xu Jingfu would assume

292
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:43,325
I've obtained evidence

293
00:17:43,724 --> 00:17:44,484
from He Rufei,

294
00:17:44,845 --> 00:17:46,004
regardless of

295
00:17:46,244 --> 00:17:47,204
its actual contents.

296
00:17:47,565 --> 00:17:48,845
After this,

297
00:17:49,405 --> 00:17:50,325
I doubt

298
00:17:50,405 --> 00:17:51,365
Xu Jingfu will continue

299
00:17:51,764 --> 00:17:52,845
to believe He Rufei.

300
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:54,684
(To He Rufei)
Show me.

301
00:18:01,764 --> 00:18:02,764
The letters are safe.

302
00:18:03,204 --> 00:18:04,524
Rest assured, Chancellor.

303
00:18:05,605 --> 00:18:07,125
Then show me.

304
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:10,484
Chancellor,

305
00:18:10,885 --> 00:18:12,244
you already know

306
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:13,845
the content of these letters.

307
00:18:14,204 --> 00:18:15,284
You just need to know

308
00:18:15,524 --> 00:18:16,085
He Yan

309
00:18:16,405 --> 00:18:18,365
took no evidence with her.

310
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,565
That's enough.

311
00:18:21,204 --> 00:18:22,885
You fear my scrutiny?

312
00:18:23,484 --> 00:18:24,125
Correct?

313
00:18:25,565 --> 00:18:27,605
You distrust me?

314
00:18:29,565 --> 00:18:31,405
Xu Jingfu is cunning.

315
00:18:32,284 --> 00:18:33,524
He won't trust easily.

316
00:18:34,004 --> 00:18:35,845
When I dealt with Xu Jingfu today

317
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,004
at his mansion,

318
00:18:38,444 --> 00:18:39,764
he remained composed

319
00:18:41,284 --> 00:18:42,925
until he saw this Linglong Box.

320
00:18:43,645 --> 00:18:44,645
Then panic set in.

321
00:18:45,405 --> 00:18:46,244
Of course.

322
00:18:47,284 --> 00:18:48,764
He might disregard other things,

323
00:18:49,565 --> 00:18:50,565
but those letters

324
00:18:51,605 --> 00:18:53,925
were written by him personally.

325
00:18:54,204 --> 00:18:55,645
They're irrefutable evidence.

326
00:18:56,244 --> 00:18:57,204
He can't deny it.

327
00:18:57,405 --> 00:18:58,524
He Rufei doesn't

328
00:18:58,565 --> 00:18:59,645
trust Xu Jingfu either.

329
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:00,805
It seems

330
00:19:01,484 --> 00:19:02,684
he wouldn't hand over

331
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:03,845
those letters to him.

332
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:04,925
After all,

333
00:19:05,605 --> 00:19:07,524
that's the only bargaining chip he has

334
00:19:07,524 --> 00:19:08,565
against Xu Jingfu.

335
00:19:09,284 --> 00:19:10,405
So from the beginning,

336
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:11,724
my goal wasn't actually

337
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:13,325
to obtain the so-called evidence.

338
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:14,724
Time was too tight

339
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,044
to find anything.

340
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:18,204
It was just a feint.

341
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,125
We just need to make Xu Jingfu believe

342
00:19:21,365 --> 00:19:22,764
that we've obtained evidence

343
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,405
from He Rufei.

344
00:19:25,044 --> 00:19:26,524
Both of them harbor guilty secrets.

345
00:19:27,044 --> 00:19:28,284
Trust died long ago.

346
00:19:28,805 --> 00:19:29,845
The rupture awaits them.

347
00:19:30,524 --> 00:19:31,365
Just

348
00:19:32,325 --> 00:19:33,244
not tonight yet.

349
00:19:35,085 --> 00:19:35,964
No matter.

350
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,444
It'll come soon enough.

351
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:40,365
Enough.

352
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:41,964
Keep these safe.

353
00:19:42,565 --> 00:19:44,684
Don't let them
fall into the wrong hands.

354
00:19:46,204 --> 00:19:47,125
Thank you, Chancellor.

355
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:50,044
I'll guard them with my life.

356
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:58,165
As you witnessed today,

357
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,684
He Yan came to your mansion triumphantly

358
00:20:00,724 --> 00:20:01,805
to flaunt her victory.

359
00:20:02,004 --> 00:20:03,405
This was clearly retaliation.

360
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:06,004
Xiao Jue and her

361
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,484
came fully prepared.

362
00:20:09,484 --> 00:20:10,284
It appears

363
00:20:11,605 --> 00:20:15,284
we must strike first.

364
00:20:16,885 --> 00:20:18,165
What's your plan?

365
00:20:19,204 --> 00:20:20,724
We must deal with Xiao Jue now.

366
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:21,805
At least,

367
00:20:22,165 --> 00:20:24,325
we must strip him of military authority.

368
00:20:24,645 --> 00:20:25,964
At the morning court in two days,

369
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:28,805
I'll handle him myself.

370
00:20:30,244 --> 00:20:31,444
As for He Yan,

371
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:33,645
that's your responsibility.

372
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:37,845
At your service, Chancellor.

373
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:49,246
(Xiao Mansion)

374
00:21:01,044 --> 00:21:01,845
Who is this?

375
00:21:03,405 --> 00:21:04,325
This is

376
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:06,764
Madam He.

377
00:21:10,165 --> 00:21:12,565
(The Xiao Mansion
and He Mansion are far apart.)

378
00:21:13,365 --> 00:21:14,605
(She deliberately detoured,)

379
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:16,805
(probably to see me.)

380
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:18,484
Thank you

381
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,085
for that day, madam.

382
00:21:22,964 --> 00:21:23,724
No need for thanks.

383
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:25,684
I'm glad you're safe.

384
00:21:26,964 --> 00:21:27,805
It's all that counts.

385
00:21:29,925 --> 00:21:30,885
How have you been?

386
00:21:31,845 --> 00:21:33,605
Have your injuries healed completely?

387
00:21:35,284 --> 00:21:36,284
I've fully recovered.

388
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:37,724
No need for concern.

389
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:39,085
(Xiao Mansion)

390
00:21:39,085 --> 00:21:39,724
Yeah.

391
00:21:40,204 --> 00:21:41,204
Leaving the He Mansion

392
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:42,964
was the best for you.

393
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:44,524
Madam He.

394
00:21:45,325 --> 00:21:46,444
There are ears.

395
00:21:46,925 --> 00:21:47,524
Be discreet.

396
00:21:48,885 --> 00:21:49,204
But...

397
00:21:49,244 --> 00:21:50,165
Return home.

398
00:22:03,165 --> 00:22:04,044
Take care of yourself.

399
00:22:17,565 --> 00:22:18,244
Your Majesty,

400
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:20,845
Wutuo envoy Maningbu

401
00:22:21,444 --> 00:22:23,484
arrived in the capital yesterday.

402
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,044
In my humble opinion,

403
00:22:25,284 --> 00:22:26,244
we should host a banquet

404
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,405
in three days

405
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:30,284
to showcase

406
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:32,645
our reputation as a civilized nation.

407
00:22:33,244 --> 00:22:36,284
What do you think, Your Majesty?

408
00:22:36,964 --> 00:22:37,565
Approved.

409
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,645
Maningbu's visit

410
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:43,044
is under orders from the Wutuo King

411
00:22:43,204 --> 00:22:45,244
to establish peace,

412
00:22:45,484 --> 00:22:47,044
cease hostilities between us,

413
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:48,605
and establish a pact

414
00:22:48,684 --> 00:22:51,244
for perpetual amity.

415
00:23:02,845 --> 00:23:04,845
Wutuo has proposed three terms

416
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,845
for the peace negotiations.

417
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:07,885
First,

418
00:23:08,444 --> 00:23:09,925
Wei and Wutuo

419
00:23:09,925 --> 00:23:11,764
shall be brotherly nations.

420
00:23:12,244 --> 00:23:14,605
Your Majesty, being elder,

421
00:23:14,964 --> 00:23:17,885
shall be addressed
as elder brother by the Wutuo King.

422
00:23:18,244 --> 00:23:21,004
This hierarchy shall continue
for future generations.

423
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:23,125
Second,

424
00:23:23,565 --> 00:23:25,004
both sides shall withdraw troops.

425
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:27,605
Border cities
of both nations shall maintain

426
00:23:27,964 --> 00:23:29,204
current defensive structures.

427
00:23:29,764 --> 00:23:32,165
No new fortifications
shall be constructed.

428
00:23:33,284 --> 00:23:34,125
And the third point?

429
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:36,365
Both sides at the border

430
00:23:37,085 --> 00:23:38,524
shall establish a market

431
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:40,365
and conduct mutual commerce

432
00:23:40,845 --> 00:23:42,004
with profits split equally.

433
00:23:42,764 --> 00:23:44,684
That's the third proposal.

434
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:54,724
Preposterous!

435
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,444
Wutuo people are cunning.

436
00:23:56,724 --> 00:23:57,524
We can't trust them!

437
00:23:57,605 --> 00:23:58,244
- Exactly.
- No.

438
00:23:58,805 --> 00:23:59,964
If this can prevent war,

439
00:24:00,284 --> 00:24:01,565
it's worth trying.

440
00:24:03,805 --> 00:24:04,524
Chancellor Xu,

441
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:05,724
Mr. Xiao,

442
00:24:06,165 --> 00:24:07,204
what are your thoughts?

443
00:24:07,805 --> 00:24:09,085
In my humble opinion,

444
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:10,605
since we

445
00:24:10,645 --> 00:24:12,365
want friendly relations with Wutuo,

446
00:24:13,044 --> 00:24:14,645
establishing trade markets

447
00:24:15,044 --> 00:24:16,365
is acceptable.

448
00:24:17,004 --> 00:24:18,964
Our cooperation

449
00:24:19,085 --> 00:24:20,325
will bring mutual benefits

450
00:24:20,405 --> 00:24:24,244
and greatly aid
our people's livelihoods.

451
00:24:29,524 --> 00:24:30,244
Setting aside

452
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:31,805
the fairness

453
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:33,244
of this 50-50 split,

454
00:24:34,085 --> 00:24:35,444
I want to ask you,

455
00:24:36,325 --> 00:24:37,845
where does Wutuo plan

456
00:24:38,605 --> 00:24:39,684
to build this market?

457
00:24:41,484 --> 00:24:42,325
Mingshui.

458
00:24:44,724 --> 00:24:46,004
How can it be placed there?

459
00:24:51,204 --> 00:24:51,764
Outrageous!

460
00:24:51,764 --> 00:24:52,645
Unthinkable!

461
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,044
This goes too far!

462
00:24:54,044 --> 00:24:54,805
A provocation!

463
00:24:54,805 --> 00:24:55,484
We cannot agree!

464
00:24:55,484 --> 00:24:56,365
A humiliation!

465
00:24:56,805 --> 00:24:57,684
Clearly intentional!

466
00:24:57,684 --> 00:24:58,204
True.

467
00:24:58,244 --> 00:24:58,964
We mustn't agree.

468
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:02,605
Your Majesty,

469
00:25:03,244 --> 00:25:04,284
I object.

470
00:25:05,165 --> 00:25:05,845
Mingshui

471
00:25:06,325 --> 00:25:08,085
is our strategic border fortress.

472
00:25:08,405 --> 00:25:10,085
Placing the market there

473
00:25:10,524 --> 00:25:11,724
would leave Wei vulnerable

474
00:25:11,925 --> 00:25:13,125
if war reignites.

475
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:14,405
Moreover,

476
00:25:15,204 --> 00:25:15,845
Mingshui

477
00:25:16,845 --> 00:25:18,724
holds the remains of 30,000

478
00:25:18,724 --> 00:25:19,484
Xiao Army soldiers.

479
00:25:20,325 --> 00:25:21,524
Does Wutuo's proposal

480
00:25:21,925 --> 00:25:23,125
show genuine sincerity

481
00:25:23,165 --> 00:25:24,565
for peace with Wei?

482
00:25:26,565 --> 00:25:28,684
This insults Wei's dignity!

483
00:25:29,565 --> 00:25:30,885
They hold treacherous intentions!

484
00:25:41,244 --> 00:25:42,125
The Xiao Army

485
00:25:42,325 --> 00:25:43,885
serves our nation.

486
00:25:44,204 --> 00:25:46,325
From marshals to foot soldiers,

487
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:47,724
it is their duty

488
00:25:47,724 --> 00:25:49,125
to fall in battle.

489
00:25:49,444 --> 00:25:50,684
But General Fengyun,

490
00:25:51,085 --> 00:25:53,244
you cling to past grievances,

491
00:25:53,805 --> 00:25:55,605
ignoring the greater good.

492
00:25:56,524 --> 00:25:57,365
How does this honor

493
00:25:57,925 --> 00:25:59,405
our fallen warriors?

494
00:26:00,244 --> 00:26:01,684
Soldiers die in war,

495
00:26:02,605 --> 00:26:03,764
only to become

496
00:26:03,885 --> 00:26:05,085
bargaining chips for others.

497
00:26:05,484 --> 00:26:06,925
General He, if you want compromise,

498
00:26:06,925 --> 00:26:07,724
you may,

499
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:08,724
but

500
00:26:09,204 --> 00:26:11,085
don't make your gains
off their sacrifice.

501
00:26:16,365 --> 00:26:17,244
To me,

502
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:20,004
until we expose

503
00:26:20,004 --> 00:26:21,605
the Mingshui Battle traitor,

504
00:26:22,724 --> 00:26:23,565
this matter

505
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:27,125
remains unresolved.

506
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:32,605
Mr. Xiao,

507
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,165
rise.

508
00:26:39,605 --> 00:26:40,204
Your Majesty,

509
00:26:40,805 --> 00:26:42,165
Wutuo's schemes are endless.

510
00:26:43,004 --> 00:26:44,125
Today's peace treaty

511
00:26:44,484 --> 00:26:46,004
will bring more demands tomorrow.

512
00:26:46,724 --> 00:26:47,284
Must we

513
00:26:47,885 --> 00:26:49,405
repeat the tragedies in Mingshui

514
00:26:49,444 --> 00:26:50,605
and Huayuan?

515
00:26:51,405 --> 00:26:52,684
How many armies do we have

516
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,565
to feed Wutuo's slaughter?

517
00:26:55,605 --> 00:26:56,365
Next,

518
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:00,444
shall we cede territory?

519
00:27:01,325 --> 00:27:02,004
Pay reparations?

520
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:03,765
Offer peace marriages?

521
00:27:04,044 --> 00:27:05,605
- T-This...
- Yeah.

522
00:27:05,605 --> 00:27:06,484
He speaks the truth!

523
00:27:07,004 --> 00:27:08,004
There's no bottom line!

524
00:27:08,605 --> 00:27:09,204
How dare you!

525
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:14,204
What's next?

526
00:27:15,204 --> 00:27:17,044
Wei's imminent collapse?

527
00:27:18,085 --> 00:27:19,484
Such audacity!

528
00:27:20,365 --> 00:27:21,444
Is it because I've treated

529
00:27:21,484 --> 00:27:22,365
you too kindly

530
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:23,444
that you've become

531
00:27:23,444 --> 00:27:25,044
so oblivious to propriety,

532
00:27:25,524 --> 00:27:26,764
arrogant

533
00:27:27,044 --> 00:27:28,044
and insolent in court?

534
00:27:28,764 --> 00:27:29,764
Get out of my sight!

535
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:30,645
Reflect at home!

536
00:28:00,925 --> 00:28:01,925
Establishing markets

537
00:28:02,605 --> 00:28:04,524
and signing treaties are important.

538
00:28:04,805 --> 00:28:05,684
We'll revisit this.

539
00:28:07,524 --> 00:28:08,044
Leave.

540
00:28:08,444 --> 00:28:10,405
Court adjourned.

541
00:28:10,964 --> 00:28:12,805
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

542
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:20,645
We mustn't fall into Wutuo's scheme.

543
00:28:20,684 --> 00:28:21,325
Indeed.

544
00:28:25,244 --> 00:28:27,085
Xiao Jue is already under house arrest.

545
00:28:27,724 --> 00:28:29,044
Why do you still appear

546
00:28:29,484 --> 00:28:30,565
so troubled?

547
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,724
Xiao Jue is insignificant.

548
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,605
I promised Maningbu

549
00:28:36,085 --> 00:28:37,325
that I'd ensure

550
00:28:37,764 --> 00:28:39,484
the trade market establishment.

551
00:28:40,325 --> 00:28:41,724
Earlier, His Majesty

552
00:28:41,764 --> 00:28:43,724
might've punished Xiao Jue,

553
00:28:44,645 --> 00:28:45,605
but he didn't approve

554
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:48,244
the trade market proposal.

555
00:28:49,444 --> 00:28:52,044
He no longer obeys me

556
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:55,085
as blindly as before.

557
00:29:18,484 --> 00:29:19,325
Is this fanfare

558
00:29:19,565 --> 00:29:20,284
enough?

559
00:29:21,085 --> 00:29:21,764
Any grander

560
00:29:21,925 --> 00:29:23,165
and Yaojing might gain

561
00:29:23,204 --> 00:29:24,684
a surplus of deaf citizens.

562
00:29:26,925 --> 00:29:28,405
Is this the top scholar's parade?

563
00:29:28,964 --> 00:29:30,365
No exams were held this year.

564
00:29:30,444 --> 00:29:31,605
No champion to celebrate.

565
00:29:31,964 --> 00:29:33,484
Besides, look at the rider.

566
00:29:33,645 --> 00:29:34,524
Rugged features,

567
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:35,444
coarse demeanor.

568
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:36,524
He's unlike

569
00:29:36,645 --> 00:29:37,885
any scholar.

570
00:29:38,004 --> 00:29:38,524
In my view,

571
00:29:38,764 --> 00:29:40,284
this must be a wedding procession.

572
00:29:40,684 --> 00:29:42,004
But no bridal attire.

573
00:29:42,085 --> 00:29:43,724
And marrying so late in life

574
00:29:44,004 --> 00:29:45,044
yet making a spectacle?

575
00:29:45,405 --> 00:29:45,964
How...

576
00:29:46,204 --> 00:29:47,605
How embarrassing!

577
00:29:47,724 --> 00:29:48,524
Shameful.

578
00:30:10,964 --> 00:30:11,405
Well?

579
00:30:11,724 --> 00:30:12,925
Did I do it well?

580
00:30:15,684 --> 00:30:16,165
Commander Li,

581
00:30:16,645 --> 00:30:17,444
long time no see.

582
00:30:18,408 --> 00:30:21,928
(Ganming Pavilion)

583
00:30:22,925 --> 00:30:23,724
Arrest the owner.

584
00:30:23,964 --> 00:30:25,325
He's a Wutuo spy in disguise

585
00:30:25,565 --> 00:30:26,805
who's lurked here for years.

586
00:30:27,004 --> 00:30:27,405
Everyone,

587
00:30:27,764 --> 00:30:28,565
bring all findings

588
00:30:28,684 --> 00:30:30,125
straight to the Ministry of War.

589
00:30:32,444 --> 00:30:33,845
(Ganming Pavilion)
Trinkets, toys.

590
00:30:33,964 --> 00:30:34,684
Take a look.

591
00:30:36,645 --> 00:30:37,684
Someone!

592
00:30:37,885 --> 00:30:39,125
Someone!

593
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:40,444
Someone!

594
00:30:40,684 --> 00:30:41,365
Someone!

595
00:30:41,605 --> 00:30:42,204
Someone!

596
00:30:42,565 --> 00:30:43,085
Sun Ling,

597
00:30:43,284 --> 00:30:44,165
stay still!

598
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:45,125
I...

599
00:30:46,565 --> 00:30:47,444
What are you doing?

600
00:30:48,244 --> 00:30:49,044
I demand an appeal.

601
00:30:49,684 --> 00:30:51,044
I accuse the current Chancellor

602
00:30:51,044 --> 00:30:51,805
Xu Jingfu!

603
00:30:51,845 --> 00:30:52,405
Nonsense!

604
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:53,645
I'm not lying!

605
00:30:54,284 --> 00:30:54,925
This ledger

606
00:30:55,044 --> 00:30:55,805
is proof.

607
00:30:59,805 --> 00:31:00,365
With Li Kuang,

608
00:31:00,365 --> 00:31:01,925
General Feihong's old friend, here,

609
00:31:03,165 --> 00:31:04,645
Xu Jingfu and He Rufei

610
00:31:04,885 --> 00:31:06,165
must be losing sleep over this.

611
00:31:10,805 --> 00:31:11,444
More than that.

612
00:31:12,524 --> 00:31:13,365
Mr. Chu

613
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:14,645
must have visited

614
00:31:14,684 --> 00:31:15,565
Xu Jingfu's residence,

615
00:31:15,925 --> 00:31:17,405
bearing more ill tidings.

616
00:31:35,565 --> 00:31:36,204
Sir.

617
00:31:41,405 --> 00:31:43,684
You've been occupied with state affairs.

618
00:31:44,724 --> 00:31:47,244
What brings you here today?

619
00:31:48,724 --> 00:31:49,724
I've learned

620
00:31:50,004 --> 00:31:50,484
Li Kuang

621
00:31:50,764 --> 00:31:52,244
entered the capital publicly.

622
00:31:54,444 --> 00:31:56,925
I've heard of it.

623
00:32:03,284 --> 00:32:04,244
What else?

624
00:32:05,004 --> 00:32:06,524
Speak plainly.

625
00:32:08,524 --> 00:32:09,885
Sun Xiangfu's son Sun Ling

626
00:32:10,204 --> 00:32:11,565
was brought to the capital

627
00:32:12,565 --> 00:32:13,645
and has completed trial,

628
00:32:13,805 --> 00:32:14,684
awaiting execution.

629
00:32:15,484 --> 00:32:16,605
Facing imminent death,

630
00:32:16,845 --> 00:32:17,964
he's making his last move.

631
00:32:18,885 --> 00:32:20,484
He suddenly surrendered an account book,

632
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:21,165
saying

633
00:32:22,365 --> 00:32:23,085
to accuse you.

634
00:32:33,004 --> 00:32:34,484
What is he accusing me of?

635
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:38,565
Of instigating Sun Xiangfu

636
00:32:39,605 --> 00:32:41,645
to commit large-scale corruption
and bribery.

637
00:32:48,004 --> 00:32:50,764
I underestimated this man.

638
00:32:51,325 --> 00:32:53,565
I always thought he was a fool.

639
00:32:54,284 --> 00:32:55,204
I never expected

640
00:32:56,044 --> 00:32:57,085
he would have

641
00:32:57,605 --> 00:33:00,004
the audacity for a deathbed struggle.

642
00:33:00,764 --> 00:33:01,964
I took the liberty

643
00:33:02,284 --> 00:33:03,605
of having this matter silenced.

644
00:33:04,244 --> 00:33:05,565
The account book is destroyed.

645
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:07,125
As for Sun Ling,

646
00:33:07,325 --> 00:33:08,524
he's already on death row.

647
00:33:08,885 --> 00:33:10,004
Currently held in isolation

648
00:33:10,204 --> 00:33:11,044
under strict guard.

649
00:33:11,204 --> 00:33:12,724
There's no need to worry.

650
00:33:14,724 --> 00:33:15,484
Excellent.

651
00:33:16,805 --> 00:33:17,845
You're thorough.

652
00:33:29,724 --> 00:33:30,325
By the way,

653
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:32,165
on my way here earlier, I heard

654
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:34,004
the owner of Ganming Pavilion

655
00:33:34,365 --> 00:33:35,244
was arrested

656
00:33:35,605 --> 00:33:36,484
for unknown reasons.

657
00:33:42,165 --> 00:33:42,764
Master,

658
00:33:43,284 --> 00:33:44,004
are you alright?

659
00:33:48,284 --> 00:33:49,325
With Li Kuang's arrival,

660
00:33:49,764 --> 00:33:50,724
the closure of the shop,

661
00:33:51,004 --> 00:33:51,925
and Sun Ling's report,

662
00:33:52,684 --> 00:33:54,204
he will make desperate moves.

663
00:33:55,004 --> 00:33:55,684
Not enough yet.

664
00:33:57,405 --> 00:33:58,325
We need one last spark.

665
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:01,284
But that spark

666
00:34:02,405 --> 00:34:03,845
will soon ignite the flames.

667
00:34:07,405 --> 00:34:08,124
Zilan,

668
00:34:09,084 --> 00:34:10,044
your information network

669
00:34:11,164 --> 00:34:12,604
is remarkably efficient.

670
00:34:16,124 --> 00:34:17,325
Merely hearsay.

671
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:21,325
What a coincidence.

672
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:27,365
My passing by

673
00:34:27,845 --> 00:34:29,084
wasn't accidental.

674
00:34:34,084 --> 00:34:34,805
It was Pingting

675
00:34:35,004 --> 00:34:36,444
who heard about their new tea

676
00:34:36,845 --> 00:34:37,964
and dragged me to sample it,

677
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:39,725
preparing to buy it for you.

678
00:34:40,564 --> 00:34:41,524
But unexpectedly,

679
00:34:41,805 --> 00:34:42,885
the shop got into trouble.

680
00:34:43,964 --> 00:34:45,245
If you have doubts,

681
00:34:45,765 --> 00:34:46,524
simply ask Pingting

682
00:34:46,964 --> 00:34:47,845
to verify the truth.

683
00:34:54,245 --> 00:34:57,285
I was just asking.

684
00:34:57,805 --> 00:34:59,205
Don't take it to heart.

685
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:00,484
Have some tea.

686
00:35:08,604 --> 00:35:09,084
Master.

687
00:35:15,644 --> 00:35:16,484
Chancellor,

688
00:35:16,805 --> 00:35:18,164
I come bearing

689
00:35:18,245 --> 00:35:19,084
His Majesty's decree.

690
00:35:19,805 --> 00:35:21,484
By the imperial decree,

691
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:24,124
Wutuo insists on establishing the market

692
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,004
at our strategic stronghold

693
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:28,164
and demands equal profit splitting.

694
00:35:28,245 --> 00:35:29,725
They show no flexibility

695
00:35:29,925 --> 00:35:30,885
and lack sincerity.

696
00:35:31,524 --> 00:35:32,084
Therefore,

697
00:35:32,325 --> 00:35:33,765
further negotiations are pointless.

698
00:35:34,444 --> 00:35:35,205
Yes,

699
00:35:36,124 --> 00:35:37,124
Your Majesty.

700
00:35:39,685 --> 00:35:40,325
Please.

701
00:35:54,124 --> 00:35:55,285
Xu Jingfu must be

702
00:35:56,004 --> 00:35:57,325
in disarray by now.

703
00:35:58,084 --> 00:35:59,805
Mr. Chu is his prized student.

704
00:36:00,205 --> 00:36:00,845
He'll surely

705
00:36:01,205 --> 00:36:02,925
seek Mr. Chu's counsel.

706
00:36:03,444 --> 00:36:04,725
The question is

707
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:06,725
what advice Mr. Chu will offer.

708
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:15,405
Here.

709
00:36:16,564 --> 00:36:17,725
Take the white pieces.

710
00:36:18,405 --> 00:36:19,765
Try to break this deadlock.

711
00:36:29,004 --> 00:36:31,004
Chu Zhao is Xu Jingfu's student,

712
00:36:32,124 --> 00:36:33,725
so their methods align naturally.

713
00:36:34,845 --> 00:36:36,164
They'll likely escalate tensions

714
00:36:37,285 --> 00:36:38,604
to reap third-party benefits.

715
00:36:55,325 --> 00:36:58,205
This approach harms you

716
00:36:58,325 --> 00:37:01,405
without damaging the enemy.

717
00:37:03,604 --> 00:37:04,925
Don't you want to solve this?

718
00:37:05,685 --> 00:37:06,885
Only by burning our boats

719
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:08,805
can we break this deadlock.

720
00:37:12,725 --> 00:37:14,044
Good.

721
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:19,044
Master,

722
00:37:19,685 --> 00:37:20,725
General He is outside.

723
00:37:21,885 --> 00:37:23,004
Let him in.

724
00:37:26,084 --> 00:37:27,044
You have a visitor.

725
00:37:27,484 --> 00:37:29,044
I shall take my leave.

726
00:37:39,484 --> 00:37:40,124
Earlier,

727
00:37:40,604 --> 00:37:42,164
Maningbu sent word again.

728
00:37:42,685 --> 00:37:44,644
He says the banquet is the deadline.

729
00:37:45,285 --> 00:37:45,925
Chancellor,

730
00:37:46,845 --> 00:37:48,484
what should we do now?

731
00:37:53,044 --> 00:37:56,044
If His Majesty agrees,

732
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,285
all will be well.

733
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:00,484
If he refuses,

734
00:38:10,285 --> 00:38:13,084
we'll replace him
with someone compliant.

735
00:38:20,648 --> 00:38:23,912
(Xiao Mansion)

736
00:39:10,325 --> 00:39:11,325
Why is everyone here?

737
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:12,765
Waiting for me?

738
00:39:13,124 --> 00:39:14,004
What can I do for you?

739
00:39:14,044 --> 00:39:14,685
Just tell me.

740
00:39:16,885 --> 00:39:17,405
Yan,

741
00:39:17,845 --> 00:39:18,885
I can't offer much help,

742
00:39:19,285 --> 00:39:20,285
but I'll await good news.

743
00:39:21,044 --> 00:39:21,685
I don't know

744
00:39:21,725 --> 00:39:22,845
what you're planning to do,

745
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:23,805
but I'm certain

746
00:39:24,205 --> 00:39:25,604
you'll achieve your goal.

747
00:39:29,964 --> 00:39:30,524
Don't you have

748
00:39:30,524 --> 00:39:31,484
anything to tell me?

749
00:39:32,564 --> 00:39:33,524
Return victorious.

750
00:39:37,365 --> 00:39:38,004
Thank you all.

751
00:39:39,365 --> 00:39:40,205
Tonight's banquet

752
00:39:40,925 --> 00:39:42,405
will bring the final resolution.

753
00:39:44,524 --> 00:39:46,444
I'll reclaim what's rightfully mine.
