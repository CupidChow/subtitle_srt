Actually,

24
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:48,152
there is something

25
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,273
I need your help with.

26
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:52,753
I'm glad to help.

27
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,232
Just say the word.

28
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:04,152
A man named Chai Anxi

29
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:06,312
currently resides in Jiyang.

30
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:07,792
Could you

31
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:10,592
get rid of him for me?

32
00:02:15,032 --> 00:02:15,872
Xiuluo Boutique

33
00:02:16,073 --> 00:02:16,752
is the biggest

34
00:02:16,912 --> 00:02:17,912
local clothing store.

35
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:18,912
They also

36
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:20,712
sell trendy accessories.

37
00:02:21,113 --> 00:02:22,793
Huaijin asked me to find this place.

38
00:02:23,152 --> 00:02:24,752
He said that the guests at the banquet

39
00:02:24,953 --> 00:02:26,592
will be local nobility.

40
00:02:26,993 --> 00:02:27,513
So,

41
00:02:27,912 --> 00:02:28,793
it's your chance

42
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:29,432
to establish

43
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:30,632

yourselves in Jiyang.

44
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:31,833
Dress

45
00:02:32,073 --> 00:02:33,432
to impress.

46
00:02:33,896 --> 00:02:34,432
Here we are.

47
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,113
Clothes make the man.

48
00:02:42,113 --> 00:02:43,032
Ask Huaijin

49
00:02:43,073 --> 00:02:44,712
to buy you a nice dress.

50
00:02:44,712 --> 00:02:45,512
Cheng Lisu.

51
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,073
Thank you, Commander.

52
00:02:52,712 --> 00:02:53,353
Let's go.

53
00:02:56,793 --> 00:02:58,152
What? I want a dress, too.

54
00:02:58,353 --> 00:02:59,312
Stop being

55
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,296
the third wheel.

56
00:03:00,393 --> 00:03:01,233
They're not really...

57
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:01,912
Come on.

58
00:03:02,353 --> 00:03:03,073
Let's check out

59
00:03:03,192 --> 00:03:03,752
the herb shop

60
00:03:03,872 --> 00:03:04,993
for your book.

61
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:16,673
Are you looking for clothes, Madam?

62
00:03:17,032 --> 00:03:17,608
Yeah.

63
00:03:17,793 --> 00:03:18,712
Welcome

64
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:19,712
to the biggest

65
00:03:19,712 --> 00:03:20,872
clothing store in Jiyang.

66
00:03:21,513 --> 00:03:22,032
Please.

67
00:03:38,088 --> 00:03:40,901
(Daughter of the Censor)

68
00:04:07,353 --> 00:04:08,152
My apologies.

69
00:04:09,712 --> 00:04:10,953
My handkerchief

70
00:04:11,073 --> 00:04:12,192
dropped and disturbed you.

71
00:04:19,272 --> 00:04:20,353
Honey, if you like this,

72
00:04:20,913 --> 00:04:21,593
just buy it.

73
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:25,392
Sir,

74
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,673
you have excellent taste.

75
00:04:27,153 --> 00:04:28,033
Once your wife

76
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:28,793
puts on

77
00:04:28,793 --> 00:04:30,593
this lotus-pink peony dress,

78
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:32,312
she'll resemble

79
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:33,872
a fairy from paintings.

80
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:38,872
Sir.

81
00:04:39,432 --> 00:04:41,072
My lady will take this dress.

82
00:04:46,793 --> 00:04:47,752
Miss Yan.

83
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:49,312
I apologize for

84
00:04:49,473 --> 00:04:50,233
neglecting you.

85
00:04:50,872 --> 00:04:52,473
Madam, perhaps,

86
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:55,072
you could pick something else.

87
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:02,664
Sir.

88
00:05:02,952 --> 00:05:04,632
- This one...
- We will take that, too.

89
00:05:29,832 --> 00:05:30,376
Sir.

90
00:05:30,793 --> 00:05:32,192
Are there more clothes in there?

91
00:05:32,673 --> 00:05:33,233
Yes, Madam.

92
00:05:33,432 --> 00:05:35,033
Those are our most exclusive pieces,

93
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:36,793
including our finest

94
00:05:37,072 --> 00:05:39,432
mermaid-silk celestial gown.

95
00:05:39,993 --> 00:05:40,553
Alright.

96
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,200
Honey.

97
00:05:44,632 --> 00:05:45,473
Please wait here

98
00:05:45,793 --> 00:05:46,913
while I take a look.

99
00:05:57,153 --> 00:05:57,752
Sir,

100
00:05:58,553 --> 00:06:00,233
I'm Yan Min'er, daughter of

101
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:00,952
Censor Yan Ling.

102
00:06:01,553 --> 00:06:03,192
May I ask your name?

103
00:06:14,568 --> 00:06:15,112
Madam,

104
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:17,272
this heavenly fragrance dress is simple

105
00:06:17,392 --> 00:06:18,153
and elegant.

106
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:19,392
And it complements

107
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,673
your complexion.

108
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:22,593
It would be a nice dress to wear

109
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:23,993
to any banquet.

110
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:25,072
- Miss Yan, here.
- You

111
00:06:25,072 --> 00:06:26,473
will outshine everyone else.

112
00:06:27,473 --> 00:06:28,832
Alright, I'll take it.

113
00:06:28,913 --> 00:06:30,568
My lady will take that one, too.

114
00:06:36,512 --> 00:06:37,192
Miss,

115
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:39,993
have I offended you somehow?

116
00:06:40,713 --> 00:06:41,272
Not at all.

117
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:42,553
I'm simply

118
00:06:42,553 --> 00:06:43,752
shopping for clothes.

119
00:06:44,473 --> 00:06:45,473
You're overthinking.

120
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:48,473
In that case,

121
00:06:49,113 --> 00:06:50,593
let's go by who came first.

122
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:52,233
I've claimed this dress.

123
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:53,593
If you like it,

124
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:54,673
the shop owner

125
00:06:54,793 --> 00:06:56,233
can get you another one.

126
00:06:57,952 --> 00:06:59,473
Classic country mindset.

127
00:06:59,793 --> 00:07:01,353
All garments here

128
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:02,353
are one-of-a-kind.

129
00:07:03,033 --> 00:07:04,793
I have picked this one.

130
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:06,392
Pick something else.

131
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:09,952
Are you going to pick

132
00:07:10,072 --> 00:07:10,913
whatever I choose

133
00:07:11,113 --> 00:07:12,153
from now on?

134
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:13,033
Well,

135
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,353
it depends on how I feel.

136
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,048
Sir.

137
00:07:23,553 --> 00:07:25,113
This, this, and these two...

138
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,593
My lady will take them all.

139
00:07:28,008 --> 00:07:28,520
Well...

140
00:07:29,512 --> 00:07:31,033
Madam, will you...

141
00:07:31,832 --> 00:07:32,993
Don't worry, sir.

142
00:07:33,473 --> 00:07:34,832
I wanted to say that

143
00:07:35,272 --> 00:07:36,233
I picked those dresses

144
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:37,872
for this young lady.

145
00:07:38,832 --> 00:07:39,553
You tricked me.

146
00:07:40,353 --> 00:07:41,793
Do you have any idea who I am?

147
00:07:42,832 --> 00:07:43,872
No, I don't.

148
00:07:44,353 --> 00:07:45,673
But I'm sure you're from

149
00:07:45,913 --> 00:07:46,632
a wealthy family.

150
00:07:47,153 --> 00:07:47,752
However,

151
00:07:47,993 --> 00:07:49,233
your upbringing seems lacking.

152
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:50,272
You should know

153
00:07:50,713 --> 00:07:52,713
that those who rest
on their ancestors' laurels

154
00:07:52,913 --> 00:07:54,312
may squander their inheritance.

155
00:07:54,376 --> 00:07:54,984
You...!

156
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:57,512
What happened?

157
00:08:00,392 --> 00:08:01,312
Sir,

158
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:03,512
I merely picked the same dress

159
00:08:03,673 --> 00:08:05,192
as this lady.

160
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:06,553
If she truly

161
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:07,952
likes this dress,

162
00:08:08,593 --> 00:08:09,713
I'll give it up.

163
00:08:10,673 --> 00:08:11,688
But

164
00:08:11,832 --> 00:08:12,632
she toyed with me

165
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:13,872
on purpose,

166
00:08:14,632 --> 00:08:16,713
which made me feel humiliated.

167
00:08:17,673 --> 00:08:18,752
I was asking my wife.

168
00:08:19,793 --> 00:08:20,793
I only trust her.

169
00:08:23,473 --> 00:08:24,312
Didn't you mention

170
00:08:24,553 --> 00:08:25,593
a collection piece?

171
00:08:26,153 --> 00:08:27,312
Bring it for my wife.

172
00:08:27,752 --> 00:08:28,593
Naturally,

173
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:29,752
she deserves only

174
00:08:29,872 --> 00:08:30,913
the finest garments.

175
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,713
Please follow me.

176
00:08:49,953 --> 00:08:50,512
Sir,

177
00:08:50,824 --> 00:08:52,473
I dare say that this gown

178
00:08:52,713 --> 00:08:53,353
doesn't exist

179
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,512
anywhere else throughout Wei.

180
00:08:56,632 --> 00:08:57,512
The fabric

181
00:08:57,632 --> 00:08:59,152
was purchased at great cost

182
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:00,353
from an overseas merchant.

183
00:09:00,713 --> 00:09:02,353
But the true marvel

184
00:09:02,512 --> 00:09:04,113
lies in the detachable shawl.

185
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,752
Steeped in alchemical solutions,

186
00:09:06,993 --> 00:09:07,993
it's impenetrable.

187
00:09:08,593 --> 00:09:09,512
It looks nice

188
00:09:09,872 --> 00:09:10,672
and offers

189
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:11,792
protection.

190
00:09:12,473 --> 00:09:13,313
If you like it,

191
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,473
let Madam try it on.

192
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:15,632
How much is it?

193
00:09:16,593 --> 00:09:17,272
One hundred.

194
00:09:18,664 --> 00:09:19,233
Miss,

195
00:09:19,473 --> 00:09:20,433
we should leave.

196
00:09:20,752 --> 00:09:21,672
Master will punish you

197
00:09:21,672 --> 00:09:23,032
for spending a fortune

198
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:24,233
on one dress.

199
00:09:25,552 --> 00:09:26,552
Only a hundred.

200
00:09:28,113 --> 00:09:29,473
As long as it pleases my wife,

201
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:30,953
it's worth it.

202
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:46,713
Does it look good?

203
00:09:47,752 --> 00:09:48,392
Yeah.

204
00:09:55,912 --> 00:09:56,512
Miss,

205
00:09:57,473 --> 00:09:58,313
settle your bill.

206
00:09:59,193 --> 00:10:00,552
It's a small business

207
00:10:00,713 --> 00:10:01,272
that relies

208
00:10:01,272 --> 00:10:02,433
on your generous patronage.

209
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:04,473
Pay up.

210
00:10:08,113 --> 00:10:08,713
Thank you.

211
00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:09,672
Sir,

212
00:10:10,184 --> 00:10:10,792
I've helped

213
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:11,792
with your business.

214
00:10:11,993 --> 00:10:12,912
Won't you thank me?

215
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:15,233
Thank you, Madam.

216
00:10:27,552 --> 00:10:28,073
Alright.

217
00:10:33,912 --> 00:10:35,313
I'll take you along next time.

218
00:10:35,313 --> 00:10:36,752
That's a promise, then.

219
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:39,073
So you came alone?

220
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:39,792
Min'er.

221
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:40,953
Isn't it

222
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,392
Xiuluo Boutique's latest design?

223
00:10:42,672 --> 00:10:43,272
So pretty.

224
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:44,593
Of course.

225
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,473
No one brings out its elegance

226
00:10:46,473 --> 00:10:47,713
better than you, Min'er.

227
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:52,392
They'll be here.

228
00:10:52,392 --> 00:10:53,912
Mr. Cui's nephew and niece-in-law

229
00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:54,953
have such a lofty air.

230
00:10:55,672 --> 00:10:56,512
They're so late

231
00:10:56,512 --> 00:10:57,392
for the banquet.

232
00:10:57,953 --> 00:10:58,713
I heard

233
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,152
they're from Wuzhou.

234
00:11:00,752 --> 00:11:02,353
Small-town folks lack etiquette.

235
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:04,392
They've probably never been to banquets.

236
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,552
Who knows how they will embarrass

237
00:11:06,552 --> 00:11:07,353
themselves?

238
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,116
Yeah.

239
00:11:39,552 --> 00:11:40,073
Alright.

240
00:11:41,152 --> 00:11:42,073
This is Master's

241
00:11:42,073 --> 00:11:43,792
nephew Qiao Huanqing,

242
00:11:44,193 --> 00:11:45,512
and our niece-in-law

243
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:46,760
Wen Yuyan.

244
00:11:47,152 --> 00:11:48,433
Please be seated.

245
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,113
Come on.

246
00:11:50,113 --> 00:11:52,953
Qiao Huanqing is so handsome

247
00:11:52,953 --> 00:11:54,032
with refined grace.

248
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:55,672
But his wife

249
00:11:55,912 --> 00:11:56,968
is utterly detestable.

250
00:11:57,672 --> 00:11:58,392
She offended you?

251
00:11:59,113 --> 00:11:59,672
Don't worry.

252
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:01,473
I'll put her in her place.

253
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,073
What's wrong?

254
00:12:10,392 --> 00:12:11,752
Originally there was nothing.

255
00:12:11,872 --> 00:12:13,593
Where could dust arise?

256
00:12:14,593 --> 00:12:15,953
What a lady-killer.

257
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:26,392
Mr. Cui,

258
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:27,672
let me toast you.

259
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:28,953
Cheers.

260
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:32,193
It's nice.

261
00:12:33,512 --> 00:12:34,073
Come on.

262
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:46,713
Honey.

263
00:12:53,752 --> 00:12:55,593
I'd like some soup.

264
00:12:55,752 --> 00:12:57,593
Would you serve me a bowl?

265
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,152
No wonder you're furious.

266
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:18,113
She does employ cunning tricks.

267
00:13:25,552 --> 00:13:26,392
Mrs. Qiao.

268
00:13:41,193 --> 00:13:42,392
You're too delicate,

269
00:13:43,193 --> 00:13:44,360
relying on your husband

270
00:13:44,473 --> 00:13:45,632
for every little thing.

271
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,296
You haven't been married yet.

272
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:49,233
So you don't get

273
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:50,752
the playful intimacy.

274
00:13:51,353 --> 00:13:52,152
Or perhaps

275
00:13:52,392 --> 00:13:53,353
you wish to be

276
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:54,313
neglected

277
00:13:54,552 --> 00:13:55,792
by your future husband?

278
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,713
A woman must
demonstrate dignified conduct

279
00:14:02,953 --> 00:14:04,392
to earn her husband's respect.

280
00:14:05,272 --> 00:14:06,032
You're merely

281
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:07,552
relying on your looks

282
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:08,792
to play the temptress.

283
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,953
Mr. Qiao, you must be careful

284
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,113
not to be tempted by mere appearance.

285
00:14:26,113 --> 00:14:26,713
I am

286
00:14:27,193 --> 00:14:29,288
playing the temptress?

287
00:14:29,672 --> 00:14:30,993
So she's into me,

288
00:14:31,512 --> 00:14:32,233
and not you?

289
00:14:33,313 --> 00:14:35,032
Maybe you made quite an impression

290
00:14:35,512 --> 00:14:36,313
at Xiuluo Boutique,

291
00:14:36,912 --> 00:14:37,512
making her

292
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,272
thoroughly captivated.

293
00:14:40,073 --> 00:14:40,912
Tell you what.

294
00:14:41,473 --> 00:14:42,993
Save the snide remarks.

295
00:14:43,473 --> 00:14:44,993
She was obviously infuriated

296
00:14:45,512 --> 00:14:46,392
because

297
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:48,353
you spent a fortune on that dress

298
00:14:48,353 --> 00:14:49,800
you bought me.

299
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,144
I bet she's going to

300
00:14:51,313 --> 00:14:53,073
look for trouble again.

301
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:54,993
This is all your fault.

302
00:14:56,512 --> 00:14:59,193
Weren't you very confident?

303
00:15:00,193 --> 00:15:01,288
Now you fear trouble?

304
00:15:07,113 --> 00:15:07,833
Mr. Cui,

305
00:15:08,473 --> 00:15:09,993
at this joyous

306
00:15:10,073 --> 00:15:11,032
family reunion,

307
00:15:11,313 --> 00:15:12,313
I volunteer

308
00:15:12,473 --> 00:15:13,552
to play a musical piece

309
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:14,552
for celebration.

310
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:15,552
Alright.

311
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,392
Xiu is renowned as Jiyang's

312
00:15:17,392 --> 00:15:18,552
most talented lady.

313
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,193
You're in for a feast

314
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:21,233
for the ears.

315
00:15:21,752 --> 00:15:23,152
Bring the zither.

316
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:15,792
Exquisite playing.

317
00:16:15,993 --> 00:16:16,593
Beautiful.

318
00:16:16,593 --> 00:16:17,192
Wonderful.

319
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:28,272
- Marvelous.
- Good.

320
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:32,872
I hope you liked it.

321
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,833
Here we go.

322
00:16:43,353 --> 00:16:44,512
We've heard Mrs. Qiao

323
00:16:44,512 --> 00:16:45,993
is renowned in Wuzhou

324
00:16:46,512 --> 00:16:48,833
for her peerless musical talents.

325
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:50,752
Fate brought us here today.

326
00:16:51,113 --> 00:16:52,193
May I have

327
00:16:52,313 --> 00:16:53,993
the honor of admiring your music?

328
00:16:57,073 --> 00:16:58,313
You are indeed

329
00:16:58,672 --> 00:17:00,073
a peerless zither artist.

330
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:03,113
I would rather not embarrass myself.

331
00:17:03,672 --> 00:17:04,512
Mrs. Qiao.

332
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:08,792
I also wish to appreciate

333
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:09,873
your zither music.

334
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:11,352
If Xiu alone

335
00:17:11,352 --> 00:17:12,953
can't convince you to play,

336
00:17:13,312 --> 00:17:14,393
can I change your mind?

337
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:26,873
Help me out.

338
00:17:27,752 --> 00:17:29,792
Didn't you learn a piece?

339
00:17:31,272 --> 00:17:33,193
I also learned circus stunts.

340
00:17:35,552 --> 00:17:37,633
Mrs. Qiao, what do you say?

341
00:17:38,153 --> 00:17:40,153
The elders are waiting.

342
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:41,792
Indeed.

343
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,832
Will you help or not?

344
00:17:51,752 --> 00:17:52,552
No.

345
00:18:05,153 --> 00:18:06,673
Honey.

346
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:10,832
Honey.

347
00:18:16,913 --> 00:18:18,433
Speak properly.

348
00:18:20,112 --> 00:18:22,032
So you're helping me?

349
00:18:23,032 --> 00:18:24,312
Yuyan,

350
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,713
are you not interested

351
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:26,673
in the zither?

352
00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:32,433
To be honest,

353
00:18:33,473 --> 00:18:34,512
we made a vow when we

354
00:18:34,832 --> 00:18:35,473
got married.

355
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,072
My wife's zither skills are exceptional,

356
00:18:38,312 --> 00:18:38,824
but

357
00:18:39,473 --> 00:18:40,673
she only plays for me.

358
00:18:42,193 --> 00:18:42,953
Therefore,

359
00:18:43,473 --> 00:18:44,393
she can't fulfill

360
00:18:44,393 --> 00:18:45,393
your wishes today.

361
00:18:47,032 --> 00:18:48,913
But you reunited

362
00:18:49,112 --> 00:18:51,193
with Mr. Cui today.

363
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:52,752
Why can't you make

364
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,193
one exception

365
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,633
for all the guests here?

366
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:57,473
My promise to my wife

367
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:00,873
is unbreakable.

368
00:19:01,832 --> 00:19:02,673
If you insist,

369
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:04,393
I'll play instead.

370
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,193
You can play the zither?

371
00:19:10,088 --> 00:19:10,673
Only passably.

372
00:19:11,112 --> 00:19:12,913
Our ancestors were all military men.

373
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:14,393
We've never cultivated

374
00:19:14,393 --> 00:19:15,552
such a refined talent.

375
00:19:15,832 --> 00:19:16,352
Attendants.

376
00:19:16,673 --> 00:19:18,512
Clean the zither.

377
00:19:18,752 --> 00:19:19,304
No need.

378
00:19:19,673 --> 00:19:20,312
I have mine.

379
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,656
(Isn't it the zither I gave him?)

380
00:20:11,072 --> 00:20:11,673
Beautiful.

381
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:17,953
Well...

382
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,233
Xiao Jue,

383
00:20:36,352 --> 00:20:37,792
do you like me?

384
00:20:44,032 --> 00:20:44,752
(It's hard)

385
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:46,633
(to find someone)

386
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:47,673
(more outstanding)

387
00:20:48,393 --> 00:20:49,552
(and prettier than him.)

388
00:21:02,953 --> 00:21:03,752
What a gentleman.

389
00:21:04,153 --> 00:21:04,713
Wonderful.

390
00:21:06,512 --> 00:21:07,032
Huanqing,

391
00:21:07,752 --> 00:21:09,713
your music left us spellbound.

392
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:11,512
Her Highness

393
00:21:11,873 --> 00:21:12,713
praised Miss Xiu

394
00:21:12,993 --> 00:21:14,433
as Jiyang's finest musician.

395
00:21:14,713 --> 00:21:16,433
Had she heard your performance,

396
00:21:16,832 --> 00:21:19,913
she would've showered you with praise.

397
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:21,953
Indeed.

398
00:21:21,993 --> 00:21:22,953
It appears that

399
00:21:23,393 --> 00:21:25,153
Mr. Cui is accepting Mr. Qiao,

400
00:21:25,913 --> 00:21:27,393
so we can't treat him

401
00:21:27,393 --> 00:21:28,592
as a mere merchant.

402
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:30,112
So what?

403
00:21:30,393 --> 00:21:31,953
He's still a merchant

404
00:21:32,393 --> 00:21:33,153
without manners

405
00:21:33,512 --> 00:21:34,832
who has offended you.

406
00:21:36,873 --> 00:21:37,552
You're right.

407
00:21:38,953 --> 00:21:39,873
We should

408
00:21:39,913 --> 00:21:40,993
teach them a lesson.

409
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:43,072
Thank you.

410
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:44,913
In fact,

411
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:47,112
my zither skills

412
00:21:47,713 --> 00:21:49,832
are nothing
compared to my wife's mastery.

413
00:21:50,673 --> 00:21:51,393
Really?

414
00:21:52,752 --> 00:21:53,433
Yuyan,

415
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:54,673
you must be

416
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:55,993
a zither master.

417
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:59,072
My husband spoils me.

418
00:21:59,633 --> 00:22:01,193
He indulges my every whim

419
00:22:01,592 --> 00:22:03,496
and exaggerates my skills.

420
00:22:11,713 --> 00:22:12,633
At first,

421
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:13,673
I only found you handsome.

422
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,312
But now I feel

423
00:22:15,592 --> 00:22:16,713
that you do resemble

424
00:22:16,953 --> 00:22:18,072
my late elder brother.

425
00:22:18,393 --> 00:22:18,993
Meanwhile,

426
00:22:19,352 --> 00:22:21,153
your temperament resembles mine.

427
00:22:21,832 --> 00:22:23,393
You're truly my family.

428
00:22:28,312 --> 00:22:29,752
I once held you when you were

429
00:22:30,512 --> 00:22:31,312
a newborn.

430
00:22:31,832 --> 00:22:32,832
Then you went missing.

431
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,953
Your parents never let go

432
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:35,752
until they died.

433
00:22:36,153 --> 00:22:36,713
If they knew

434
00:22:36,713 --> 00:22:38,552
you had turned out to be outstanding,

435
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:40,633
they'd be overjoyed.

436
00:22:45,913 --> 00:22:46,512
Sorry.

437
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:47,873
Why did I bring up

438
00:22:47,873 --> 00:22:48,913
the sad stories?

439
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:49,480
Right?

440
00:22:50,153 --> 00:22:50,993
Huanqing, Yuyan.

441
00:22:51,393 --> 00:22:52,512
You're here just in time

442
00:22:53,112 --> 00:22:54,512
for the Start of Spring,

443
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,713
which marks Jiyang's Water God Festival.

444
00:22:57,272 --> 00:22:58,153
You must go out

445
00:22:58,193 --> 00:22:59,193
and look around.

446
00:22:59,233 --> 00:22:59,873
You'll never

447
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,233
want to leave after that.

448
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:02,633
Start of Spring?

449
00:23:03,873 --> 00:23:04,392
Yeah.

450
00:23:04,552 --> 00:23:05,352
What's wrong?

451
00:23:06,473 --> 00:23:06,913
Nothing.

452
00:23:07,393 --> 00:23:09,072
It happens to be

453
00:23:09,112 --> 00:23:10,193
my birthday

454
00:23:11,752 --> 00:23:12,633
a few days after that.

455
00:23:13,673 --> 00:23:14,512
What a coincidence.

456
00:23:15,272 --> 00:23:16,112
Really?

457
00:23:16,673 --> 00:23:17,393
Fate binds you

458
00:23:17,393 --> 00:23:18,832
to Jiyang, as you were born

459
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:20,193
so close

460
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:21,768
to the Water God Festival.

461
00:23:21,953 --> 00:23:22,504
Huanqing,

462
00:23:22,713 --> 00:23:23,272
we must

463
00:23:23,552 --> 00:23:24,512
celebrate her birthday

464
00:23:24,713 --> 00:23:25,512
properly.

465
00:23:25,953 --> 00:23:26,592
Alright.

466
00:23:32,193 --> 00:23:32,792
Master.

467
00:23:34,072 --> 00:23:34,664
Yuyan,

468
00:23:35,193 --> 00:23:36,072
may I have a word?

469
00:23:36,953 --> 00:23:37,544
Alright.

470
00:23:39,512 --> 00:23:40,512
Excuse me for a second.

471
00:23:46,832 --> 00:23:48,393
Those young ladies are waiting

472
00:23:48,713 --> 00:23:49,993
for you in the garden.

473
00:23:50,713 --> 00:23:51,512
What for?

474
00:23:52,393 --> 00:23:52,953
They are

475
00:23:52,953 --> 00:23:54,193
local noble ladies

476
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,673
who genuinely wish to hear your music.

477
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:57,993
So, they are

478
00:23:58,352 --> 00:23:59,633
waiting earnestly.

479
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:02,592
Since those noble ladies

480
00:24:02,752 --> 00:24:03,713
are so earnest,

481
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:05,153
I'll certainly meet them.

482
00:24:05,312 --> 00:24:06,312
Alright, let's go.

483
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:09,864
A maiden departs,

484
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:11,312
a world away from kin.

485
00:24:12,352 --> 00:24:13,480
- Look.
- Mrs. Qiao is here.

486
00:24:18,473 --> 00:24:19,752
I hear you noble ladies

487
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,288
- are waiting for me.
- Mrs. Qiao.

488
00:24:22,913 --> 00:24:23,633
Not exactly.

489
00:24:24,752 --> 00:24:26,552
We are simply having

490
00:24:26,713 --> 00:24:27,633
casual conversations.

491
00:24:27,993 --> 00:24:28,633
I hope

492
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,873
you don't mind our intrusion.

493
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:31,512
The weather's fine.

494
00:24:32,112 --> 00:24:32,713
How about

495
00:24:32,913 --> 00:24:33,832
we host

496
00:24:33,832 --> 00:24:34,953
a poetry exchange here?

497
00:24:35,512 --> 00:24:36,633
Firstly for fun,

498
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:37,633
secondly

499
00:24:38,032 --> 00:24:39,913
to admire Mrs. Qiao's literary talents.

500
00:24:40,473 --> 00:24:41,112
(Is she)

501
00:24:41,153 --> 00:24:42,312
(holding a grudge)

502
00:24:42,312 --> 00:24:43,153
(over the dress?)

503
00:24:43,953 --> 00:24:44,993
I have no desire

504
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:46,752
for poetry, chess,

505
00:24:47,072 --> 00:24:47,993
or calligraphy.

506
00:24:48,473 --> 00:24:49,072
Nor will I

507
00:24:49,272 --> 00:24:50,272
play the zither.

508
00:24:51,233 --> 00:24:52,512
Do you disdain our company?

509
00:24:53,153 --> 00:24:54,393
You got me wrong.

510
00:24:54,752 --> 00:24:55,993
Would you like to talk about

511
00:24:56,512 --> 00:24:57,272
something

512
00:24:57,673 --> 00:24:58,512
more entertaining?

513
00:25:03,913 --> 00:25:04,633
I hear Miss He

514
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:05,193
is pestered

515
00:25:05,193 --> 00:25:06,072
by those noble ladies.

516
00:25:08,032 --> 00:25:09,272
Can't you walk faster?

517
00:25:10,153 --> 00:25:10,752
What if

518
00:25:10,752 --> 00:25:11,913
they tear her apart

519
00:25:11,913 --> 00:25:12,913
and devour her alive?

520
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:14,752
Even against ten men,

521
00:25:15,153 --> 00:25:16,193
let alone women,

522
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:17,873
she'd still prevail.

523
00:25:18,272 --> 00:25:19,072
What do you know?

524
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:20,392
Mean words

525
00:25:20,392 --> 00:25:21,552
hurt worse than blades.

526
00:25:23,713 --> 00:25:24,832
Didn't you hear me?

527
00:25:25,312 --> 00:25:26,512
Walk faster.

528
00:25:26,713 --> 00:25:27,673
Hurry up.

529
00:25:30,088 --> 00:25:30,953
I know

530
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:32,352
you're concerned about

531
00:25:32,433 --> 00:25:34,112
my married life with my husband.

532
00:25:34,592 --> 00:25:34,993
True.

533
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:36,552
We're deeply

534
00:25:36,913 --> 00:25:38,193
in love.

535
00:25:39,473 --> 00:25:40,352
I have

536
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:41,633
a terrible temper

537
00:25:41,993 --> 00:25:43,393
and get sulky all the time.

538
00:25:43,713 --> 00:25:44,512
My husband

539
00:25:45,032 --> 00:25:46,552
has no choice but to appease me.

540
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,792
He makes noodles for me

541
00:25:49,153 --> 00:25:50,193
and buys me jewelry

542
00:25:50,352 --> 00:25:51,193
and clothes.

543
00:25:51,673 --> 00:25:52,272
You were there

544
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,512
when he was picking clothes for me,

545
00:25:55,072 --> 00:25:56,552
weren't you, Miss Yan?

546
00:25:57,312 --> 00:25:58,233
Therefore,

547
00:25:58,233 --> 00:25:59,792
what's the point

548
00:26:00,072 --> 00:26:00,993
of learning the arts?

549
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:02,352
When I'm angry,

550
00:26:02,592 --> 00:26:03,433
my husband

551
00:26:03,473 --> 00:26:05,233
plays the zither

552
00:26:05,312 --> 00:26:06,633
to cheer me up.

553
00:26:08,032 --> 00:26:09,112
What you've glimpsed

554
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:10,953
is merely the tip of the iceberg.

555
00:26:11,193 --> 00:26:11,993
The unseen devotion

556
00:26:12,393 --> 00:26:13,433
overflows endlessly.

557
00:26:15,592 --> 00:26:17,193
Such an extraordinary man,

558
00:26:17,552 --> 00:26:19,233
peerless among his contemporaries,

559
00:26:19,592 --> 00:26:21,873
chooses to shower affection
solely on me,

560
00:26:22,312 --> 00:26:23,673
seeing no one else.

561
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:24,360
Tell me.

562
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:25,673
What can I do?

563
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:26,696
My bad.

564
00:26:26,832 --> 00:26:27,673
She doesn't need us.

565
00:26:27,993 --> 00:26:28,552
Let's go.

566
00:26:31,312 --> 00:26:32,072
Since we're here,

567
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:33,552
let's hear

568
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,193
what other nonsense

569
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:36,153
she can spout.

570
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:37,312
So,

571
00:26:37,713 --> 00:26:39,312
you're free to learn

572
00:26:39,752 --> 00:26:41,032
all those arts.

573
00:26:41,352 --> 00:26:42,233
But you should

574
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:43,993
learn those for your own pleasure.

575
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:46,193
If you want to please men,

576
00:26:46,552 --> 00:26:47,713
you'd better study

577
00:26:48,153 --> 00:26:49,473
the art of taming a husband.

578
00:26:49,832 --> 00:26:51,112
The art of taming a husband?

579
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:54,272
Tell us

580
00:26:54,673 --> 00:26:55,832
what that is about.

581
00:26:56,873 --> 00:26:57,433
Yeah.

582
00:26:58,312 --> 00:26:59,393
My husband and I met

583
00:26:59,713 --> 00:27:01,193
during the Lantern Festival

584
00:27:01,272 --> 00:27:02,233
very briefly.

585
00:27:02,673 --> 00:27:03,752
We barely crossed paths.

586
00:27:04,032 --> 00:27:04,673
However,

587
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,552
he came to propose the very next day,

588
00:27:07,233 --> 00:27:08,512
vowing to marry no one but me.

589
00:27:09,193 --> 00:27:10,393
He even threatened

590
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:11,713
to hang himself

591
00:27:12,072 --> 00:27:13,233
if I refused.

592
00:27:18,032 --> 00:27:18,673
I thought

593
00:27:19,032 --> 00:27:20,592
I might as well do a good deed

594
00:27:20,993 --> 00:27:22,512
and save his life.

595
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,200
Besides,

596
00:27:24,832 --> 00:27:26,512
even the most virtuous woman

597
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,433
can't resist a persistent suitor.

598
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:31,592
He pestered me relentlessly,

599
00:27:31,832 --> 00:27:33,153
so I had to marry him.

600
00:27:36,512 --> 00:27:37,233
You know what?

601
00:27:37,993 --> 00:27:39,193
The key to taming a man

602
00:27:39,673 --> 00:27:40,873
boils down to

603
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:42,752
one principle.

604
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:44,832
What is it?

605
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:48,272
You may love him,

606
00:27:48,953 --> 00:27:51,512
but never lose yourself.

607
00:27:52,433 --> 00:27:54,112
In relationships,

608
00:27:54,112 --> 00:27:56,072
men and women should be equal.

609
00:27:56,752 --> 00:27:57,792
In trivial matters,

610
00:27:57,993 --> 00:27:59,473
one may take the upper hand,

611
00:27:59,792 --> 00:28:01,193
another the lower.

612
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:02,832
It's just like warfare.

613
00:28:03,352 --> 00:28:05,032
If you constantly

614
00:28:05,032 --> 00:28:06,552
prioritize him,

615
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:08,633
things may not end well.

616
00:28:09,112 --> 00:28:10,352
Treat yourself well,

617
00:28:10,673 --> 00:28:12,713
and love will find you naturally.

618
00:28:14,352 --> 00:28:14,913
Take me,

619
00:28:14,913 --> 00:28:15,512
for example.

620
00:28:15,993 --> 00:28:17,272
I never try to

621
00:28:17,312 --> 00:28:18,312
fawn over my husband,

622
00:28:18,592 --> 00:28:21,032
but he treasures me dearly.

623
00:28:21,552 --> 00:28:22,913
That's what I've achieved.

624
00:28:23,752 --> 00:28:24,792
I don't understand

625
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:25,713
what she's saying,

626
00:28:26,233 --> 00:28:27,512
but it sounds impressive.

627
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:30,112
Then, memorize

628
00:28:31,713 --> 00:28:32,633
everything she says.

629
00:28:33,272 --> 00:28:34,592
What nonsense?

630
00:28:34,993 --> 00:28:35,913
Women must adhere

631
00:28:36,153 --> 00:28:36,792
to the norms

632
00:28:36,792 --> 00:28:38,272
and obey their husbands

633
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:39,953
once they're married.

634
00:28:40,473 --> 00:28:42,233
You are spouting nonsense here.

635
00:28:42,873 --> 00:28:44,072
Aren't you ashamed?

636
00:28:44,512 --> 00:28:45,552
Everyone should

637
00:28:45,873 --> 00:28:47,713
treat each other with equality

638
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:48,832
and respect.

639
00:28:49,153 --> 00:28:50,153
Why'd I be ashamed?

640
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:51,433
Or perhaps,

641
00:28:52,112 --> 00:28:53,193
you believe that

642
00:28:53,713 --> 00:28:55,913
you're born inferior to men.

643
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,153
Women shouldn't

644
00:28:59,153 --> 00:29:00,233
be confined to

645
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:02,153
inner chambers.

646
00:29:02,552 --> 00:29:03,832
The world is vast.

647
00:29:04,272 --> 00:29:04,832
We deserve

648
00:29:04,832 --> 00:29:05,913
a broader horizon.

649
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:08,032
But...

650
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:09,792
But we don't know

651
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:10,873
where to begin.

652
00:29:13,272 --> 00:29:15,473
Travel ten thousand miles,
read ten thousand books.

653
00:29:16,072 --> 00:29:17,832
If it's difficult to travel,

654
00:29:18,193 --> 00:29:20,473
start with reading.

655
00:29:21,233 --> 00:29:22,512
We do read regularly.

656
00:29:23,913 --> 00:29:24,752
But there are

657
00:29:24,792 --> 00:29:25,832
many other books to read

658
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:26,913
beyond the ones

659
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:28,673
guiding you to be ladies.

660
00:29:28,993 --> 00:29:29,592
For example,

661
00:29:30,032 --> 00:29:31,512
we could read the books

662
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:32,713
men read.

663
00:29:33,512 --> 00:29:34,132
Yeah.

664
00:29:39,993 --> 00:29:40,993
Take me, for example.

665
00:29:41,633 --> 00:29:42,873
I embrace all kinds

666
00:29:43,193 --> 00:29:44,032
of knowledge.

667
00:29:44,873 --> 00:29:46,032
I've even studied images

668
00:29:46,433 --> 00:29:47,592
with my husband.

669
00:29:48,032 --> 00:29:49,433
- What images?
- What images?

670
00:29:50,352 --> 00:29:52,032
Erotic...

671
00:29:52,232 --> 00:29:52,752
Honey.

672
00:29:52,752 --> 00:29:53,433
Images.

673
00:30:02,112 --> 00:30:02,913
What are you doing?

674
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:06,504
Nothing.

675
00:30:07,352 --> 00:30:07,993
I'm just

676
00:30:08,552 --> 00:30:09,233
having tea

677
00:30:10,272 --> 00:30:11,473
with these ladies.

678
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,192
Sisters,

679
00:30:17,224 --> 00:30:18,473
I'll take my leave.

680
00:30:26,832 --> 00:30:27,433
I've never

681
00:30:27,433 --> 00:30:28,633
seen someone so vulgar.

682
00:30:33,312 --> 00:30:34,408
It's exhausting.

683
00:30:35,873 --> 00:30:37,393
I sat upright all day.

684
00:30:38,072 --> 00:30:40,312
Acting like a woman is such a challenge.

685
00:30:40,552 --> 00:30:41,352
It's much worse

686
00:30:41,352 --> 00:30:43,153
than a full day's training.

687
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,312
Acting like a woman?

688
00:30:44,913 --> 00:30:46,032
As if you're not

689
00:30:46,032 --> 00:30:46,552
a woman.

690
00:30:47,352 --> 00:30:47,993
Whose reputation

691
00:30:47,993 --> 00:30:49,193
are you trying to ruin?

692
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:50,352
Yours

693
00:30:50,352 --> 00:30:51,473
or mine?

694
00:30:59,993 --> 00:31:00,913
Sorry, Commander.

695
00:31:01,752 --> 00:31:03,233
But I just don't get it.

696
00:31:03,713 --> 00:31:04,512
Jiyang City

697
00:31:04,713 --> 00:31:05,913
is governed by Her Highness.

698
00:31:06,272 --> 00:31:07,633
But why are the local women

699
00:31:07,673 --> 00:31:08,673
still bound by

700
00:31:08,673 --> 00:31:09,752
those outdated norms?

701
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:14,193
But then again,

702
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:15,633
women have been

703
00:31:15,848 --> 00:31:16,393
confined

704
00:31:16,393 --> 00:31:17,633
for thousands of years.

705
00:31:18,032 --> 00:31:18,953
How could they

706
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:20,713
change overnight?

707
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:22,552
How can I blame them?

708
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:29,473
Your good looks caused trouble,

709
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:32,233
and I bore the consequences.

710
00:31:41,072 --> 00:31:41,592
Commander,

711
00:31:42,393 --> 00:31:43,633
didn't you eat enough

712
00:31:43,633 --> 00:31:44,792
at the banquet?

713
00:31:47,832 --> 00:31:48,752
Someone was flustered

714
00:31:49,272 --> 00:31:49,953
at the banquet

715
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:51,913
because of Ling Xiu

716
00:31:52,393 --> 00:31:53,352
and barely had food.

717
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:55,592
So, these

718
00:31:55,953 --> 00:31:56,993
are for me?

719
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,633
Thank you, Commander. You're so sweet.

720
00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:01,873
You're the best person

721
00:32:01,873 --> 00:32:02,632
in the world.

722
00:32:02,953 --> 00:32:04,032
Let's eat together.

723
00:32:04,393 --> 00:32:05,032
Dig in.

724
00:32:05,953 --> 00:32:06,728
Cut the flattery.

725
00:32:18,713 --> 00:32:19,433
Is your birthday

726
00:32:20,953 --> 00:32:21,953
really coming soon?

727
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:24,552
According to the registry,

728
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:26,233
it's in the summer.

729
00:32:29,473 --> 00:32:31,272
I just made it up.

730
00:32:31,673 --> 00:32:32,193
What if

731
00:32:32,552 --> 00:32:33,233
Mr. Cui gives me

732
00:32:33,233 --> 00:32:34,193
a birthday gift?

733
00:32:34,512 --> 00:32:35,633
It's my chance to make

734
00:32:35,673 --> 00:32:36,673
a good profit.

735
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:40,993
Liar.

736
00:32:45,032 --> 00:32:45,713
What is it?

737
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:46,952
Commander.

738
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:48,792
We've located Chai Anxi.

739
00:32:52,233 --> 00:32:54,072
If you come along in this dress,

740
00:32:54,393 --> 00:32:54,953
you may

741
00:32:55,352 --> 00:32:56,112
arouse suspicion.

742
00:32:58,504 --> 00:32:59,016
Alright.

743
00:32:59,352 --> 00:32:59,993
Go ahead.

744
00:33:03,312 --> 00:33:03,913
Hurry up.

745
00:33:04,433 --> 00:33:05,233
You'll regret it

746
00:33:05,433 --> 00:33:06,472
if I change my mind.

747
00:33:30,272 --> 00:33:31,112
Have you seen a man

748
00:33:31,112 --> 00:33:31,673
in his forties

749
00:33:31,993 --> 00:33:33,032
with a limp

750
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:34,433
on his left leg?

751
00:33:35,433 --> 00:33:35,993
No.

752
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:38,112
He is crucial to us.

753
00:33:38,552 --> 00:33:39,913
He's served in the army.

754
00:33:40,193 --> 00:33:41,032
If you spot him

755
00:33:41,752 --> 00:33:42,752
one day,

756
00:33:42,832 --> 00:33:43,433
inform us.

757
00:33:43,832 --> 00:33:44,752
We'll reward you.

758
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:15,720
Commander.

759
00:34:17,232 --> 00:34:17,993
Cuiwei Pavilion

760
00:34:18,232 --> 00:34:19,112
is a jewelry shop.

761
00:34:19,552 --> 00:34:20,273
A fire broke out

762
00:34:20,512 --> 00:34:21,393
two hours ago.

763
00:34:22,112 --> 00:34:23,232
The owner and the workers

764
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:24,112
all survived.

765
00:34:24,753 --> 00:34:25,873
Only the new accountant

766
00:34:26,353 --> 00:34:27,032
with immobility

767
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:28,232
died in there.

768
00:34:28,913 --> 00:34:29,473
And the body?

769
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:30,393
It's inside.

770
00:34:30,712 --> 00:34:31,353
Want to see it?

771
00:34:36,072 --> 00:34:37,152
If I'm not mistaken,

772
00:34:37,704 --> 00:34:38,313
the body

773
00:34:38,313 --> 00:34:39,313
must be unrecognizable.

774
00:34:39,793 --> 00:34:40,993
Indeed.

775
00:34:41,753 --> 00:34:42,273
That is not

776
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:43,873
Chai Anxi.

777
00:34:44,393 --> 00:34:44,953
Commander.

778
00:34:45,512 --> 00:34:46,313
Are you saying

779
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:48,393
that he set the fire

780
00:34:49,032 --> 00:34:49,953
and faked his death?

781
00:34:50,993 --> 00:34:51,632
Makes sense.

782
00:34:52,353 --> 00:34:53,232
If I were Chai Anxi,

783
00:34:53,672 --> 00:34:55,072
who's wanted by the authorities,

784
00:34:55,592 --> 00:34:56,793
I'd fake my death

785
00:34:56,953 --> 00:34:57,873
rather than

786
00:34:58,353 --> 00:34:59,592
waiting to be caught.

787
00:35:00,112 --> 00:35:00,753
Security

788
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:03,072
was tightened in Jiyang City

789
00:35:03,313 --> 00:35:03,953
after the fire.

790
00:35:04,632 --> 00:35:05,913
Chai Anxi is injured.

791
00:35:06,913 --> 00:35:08,393
He must be hiding in the city.

792
00:35:09,072 --> 00:35:10,032
I'll send people

793
00:35:10,344 --> 00:35:11,273
to search for him.

794
00:35:11,913 --> 00:35:12,712
We must hurry.

795
00:35:13,473 --> 00:35:14,433
Chu Zhao also has eyes

796
00:35:14,753 --> 00:35:15,753
fixed on Chai Anxi.

797
00:35:16,632 --> 00:35:17,753
We must beat him to it.

798
00:35:34,672 --> 00:35:35,552
They beat us to it.

799
00:35:36,632 --> 00:35:37,632
Should we go in?

800
00:35:38,473 --> 00:35:39,112
No need.

801
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:40,433
Didn't you

802
00:35:40,993 --> 00:35:41,833
gather enough

803
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:42,473
information?

804
00:35:43,152 --> 00:35:44,353
The witness only mentioned

805
00:35:44,672 --> 00:35:45,672
that someone died.

806
00:35:45,993 --> 00:35:46,953
That was convenient.

807
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,032
Chai Anxi

808
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,672
is prudent and cunning.

809
00:35:49,913 --> 00:35:50,672
This is merely

810
00:35:50,712 --> 00:35:51,993
a smokescreen.

811
00:35:54,512 --> 00:35:55,072
Let's go.

812
00:35:55,393 --> 00:35:56,512
We can't be spotted

813
00:35:56,712 --> 00:35:57,433
by Xiao Jue.

814
00:36:03,393 --> 00:36:04,072
Watch out.

815
00:36:38,232 --> 00:36:38,793
Young Master!

816
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,376
(Xu)

817
00:36:47,152 --> 00:36:47,712
Let him go.

818
00:36:48,592 --> 00:36:49,273
Are you alright?

819
00:36:49,672 --> 00:36:50,232
I'm fine.

820
00:36:51,273 --> 00:36:52,072
Weird guy.

821
00:36:52,632 --> 00:36:53,632
He stalked us,

822
00:36:53,793 --> 00:36:54,632
suddenly attacked,

823
00:36:54,873 --> 00:36:55,712
and fled in haste.

824
00:36:56,433 --> 00:36:57,512
What does he want?

825
00:37:03,592 --> 00:37:04,913
Fashioning weapons from bones

826
00:37:06,192 --> 00:37:07,433
is a Wutuo custom.

827
00:37:09,192 --> 00:37:10,032
He's from Wutuo.

828
00:37:11,873 --> 00:37:12,552
But why was he

829
00:37:12,552 --> 00:37:14,232
interested in Chai Anxi?

830
00:37:14,592 --> 00:37:15,313
And why

831
00:37:16,313 --> 00:37:17,712
did he spare my life?

832
00:37:18,672 --> 00:37:19,313
Anyway,

833
00:37:19,873 --> 00:37:21,032
watch Xiao Jue's men.

834
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:22,552
When the time comes,

835
00:37:23,313 --> 00:37:24,353
we'll strike first.
