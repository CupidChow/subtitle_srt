00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,440
Thank you for coming all this way,

24
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,160
Mr. Chu, to help us

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,240
settle the issue

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,000
with Yezhou Garrison.

27
00:01:55,752 --> 00:01:57,440
Please, have some tea.

28
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,520
Don't mention it, Mr. Sun.

29
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,919
How is the Chancellor?

30
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,520
Master is fine,

31
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,360
though somewhat troubled.

32
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:11,159
Who dares to

33
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:12,439
cause distress

34
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:13,448
to the Chancellor?

35
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,999
Could it be Xiao Jue?

36
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,719
You're mistaken, Mr. Sun.

37
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:28,719
What troubles the Chancellor

38
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,719
is naturally the state affairs.

39
00:02:32,776 --> 00:02:33,640
Of course.

40
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:34,839
Of course.

41
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,040
I merely wish to share

42
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:38,088
his burdens.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,928
Mr. Chu.

44
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:44,719
You've traveled this great distance.

45
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,559
I've prepared a welcoming banquet.

46
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:47,400
I hope you will

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,960
grace us with your presence.

48
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:52,920
The guest of honor must be

49
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,599
Commander Xiao, right?

50
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,960
Speaking of Commander Xiao,

51
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:59,119
I have

52
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:01,159
so much to say.

53
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,520
He's sent me missives

54
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,399
since his appointment,

55
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,679
demanding either funds

56
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:06,520
or provisions.

57
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,200
But we're having

58
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,360
a difficult time

59
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,159
in Yezhou.

60
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,768
The Chancellor

61
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,240
is fully aware

62
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,559
of all the circumstances.

63
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:24,159
What are you implying, Mr. Sun?

64
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:25,920
Master resides in Yaojing.

65
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,119
How could he know what's going on here?

66
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,119
I misspoke.

67
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:35,599
I apologize.

68
00:03:37,928 --> 00:03:38,824
Ding Yi.

69
00:03:39,112 --> 00:03:40,040
Come here.

70
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,599
Meet Mr. Chu Zhao.

71
00:03:42,952 --> 00:03:43,912
Mr. Chu.

72
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,559
This is Ding Yi.

73
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,760
General Feihong

74
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,960
sent him over.

75
00:03:48,584 --> 00:03:49,512
Greetings, Mr. Chu.

76
00:03:49,768 --> 00:03:50,632
General says

77
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,159
I'm at your disposal

78
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,200
whenever you need me.

79
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:57,200
General Feihong is too kind.

80
00:03:57,608 --> 00:03:58,536
I don't need you

81
00:03:58,536 --> 00:03:59,400
for anything.

82
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:03,719
Mr. Chu.

83
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,719
Excuse me for a second.

84
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,119
Let me check on

85
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,279
the banquet.

86
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:08,960
With two distinguished guests here,

87
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:11,336
- I dare not make any mistakes.
- Indeed.

88
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,599
Make thorough preparation.

89
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:14,056
Master.

90
00:04:16,648 --> 00:04:17,352
Master.

91
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:18,880
It's Commander Xiao and Mr. Cheng.

92
00:04:21,864 --> 00:04:22,600
Mr. Chu.

93
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,320
(Sun Mansion)
What an honor, Commander.

94
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:33,719
Forgive me for failing

95
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:35,520
to greet you properly.

96
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,039
Please meet the inspector,

97
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:41,760
Mr. Chu Zhao.

98
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,496
Commander Xiao.

99
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:44,440
Long time no see.

100
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,320
Mr. Chu.

101
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,719
Long time no see.

102
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,960
(It's him?)

103
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,799
(Come to think of it,)

104
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,760
(I once swindled him.)

105
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,520
(But I did give him medicine.)

106
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,799
(I guess we're even.)

107
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,279
Nice to meet you.

108
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:02,680
Mr. Cheng.

109
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:05,039
(It looks like)

110
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,520
(he's not going to expose me)

111
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,479
(in public.)

112
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:10,880
I am

113
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:12,839
Cheng Lisu.

114
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:14,039
Greetings, Inspector.

115
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,880
What is it, Father?

116
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,408
Ling.

117
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,039
Apologize to Commander Xiao

118
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,440
and Mr. Cheng.

119
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,239
Sorry, I have offended you.

120
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,200
Please kindly

121
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,760
forgive me.

122
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,599
Go on.

123
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,159
I'm unworthy of your anger.

124
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,479
So you realize that

125
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:52,719
you're unworthy?

126
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,719
Shall we be seated

127
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,760
first?

128
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,719
Commander.

129
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:06,000
You need to talk to Mr. Sun.

130
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,880
Go ahead.

131
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,320
Please.

132
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:37,288
(Peace and Harmony)

133
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,359
Commander.

134
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,719
You assumed

135
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,159
your position some time ago.

136
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,479
I haven't had the chance

137
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:48,599
to pay my respects.

138
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:49,640
Instead,

139
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,000
you came to see me first.

140
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,599
I feel so guilty.

141
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,080
Let me

142
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,640
toast to you.

143
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:57,680
You're too kind.

144
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,359
I don't mind visiting

145
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,479
as long as we work out

146
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,159
the problems of supplies

147
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:04,640
and funds.

148
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,320
Commander, your words

149
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,919
make me burn with shame.

150
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,080
An army without supplies perishes.

151
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,960
That

152
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:19,120
I know.

153
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,880
I also want to handle it

154
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,239
perfectly.

155
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:23,320
It's just that

156
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:25,039
our county granary has had

157
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,640
no grain reserves for years.

158
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,039
I truly can't

159
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,520
raise any funds.

160
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,399
Despite such hardships,

161
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,320
you are still able

162
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:35,719
to treat us to such

163
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,120
lavish delicacies.

164
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:38,640
Mr. Sun,

165
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,599
you're too kind.

166
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,200
Don't mention it.

167
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,000
It's good

168
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,359
that the inspector is also here.

169
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,599
Mr. Chu,

170
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,960
we should absolutely look into

171
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:52,799
the tax ledger

172
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:55,479
for the tax collection details.

173
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:57,512
Was the tax left uncollected,

174
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,120
or was there foul play?

175
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,760
We're counting on you, Mr. Chu.

176
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:11,680
Mr. Sun.

177
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:13,919
I'm here.

178
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:14,960
Shouldn't you

179
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,719
toast Mr. Chu?

180
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,159
A timely reminder, Commander.

181
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,008
I was

182
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,719
almost rude.

183
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:28,000
Mr. Chu,

184
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,599
here is to you.

185
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:32,400
I beg your forgiveness.

186
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,752
Ling.

187
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,400
Please forgive me.

188
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,400
Please don't say that.

189
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,719
Duties take precedence.

190
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,920
Besides,

191
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:51,320
this concerns

192
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:53,519
the basic welfare of the soldiers,

193
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:54,960
which is the top priority.

194
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,879
I will spare no effort

195
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,879
in fulfilling my inspection duties.

196
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:01,119
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

197
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:05,560
We appreciate it.

198
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,639
Enough of unpleasant talks.

199
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:12,920
I will stay

200
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,960
at your mansion for a few days.

201
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,839
I hope

202
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,839
I won't ruin your mood, Mr. Sun.

203
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,960
Not at all.

204
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,400
It's my honor

205
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,920
to have you reside here.

206
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,160
To complement this occasion,

207
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,080
I have

208
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:31,599
prepared a little show

209
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:32,479
to enhance

210
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,200
festivities.

211
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:49,416
(Peace and Harmony)

212
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:53,359
(That man visited the Wanhua Pavilion)

213
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:55,440
(to select dancers.)

214
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,200
Someone.

215
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:19,759
Bring forth my aged vintage

216
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:20,280
from storage.

217
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,280
Let our guests sample it.

218
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,800
Commander.

219
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,200
Mr. Cheng.

220
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:49,040
Let me toast you both.

221
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,320
Bottoms up.

222
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:09,759
Uncle, I toast you.

223
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:13,960
Uncle.

224
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:14,879
It's poisoned.

225
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,040
This wine is poisoned.

226
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:20,328
I...

227
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,440
I had no idea.

228
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,280
Guards.

229
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,440
Oh my! Help!

230
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,160
Oh my! Assassins!

231
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:32,280
Assassins!

232
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,200
Sun Xiangfu.

233
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,400
Summon the guards.

234
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,800
Guards.

235
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Guards.

236
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:41,560
Didn't you hear us?

237
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:42,759
Guards.

238
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:44,119
Are you dead?

239
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,479
Watch out.

240
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,239
Help.

241
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:17,839
Help me.

242
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:26,759
Help.

243
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:48,808
Uncle.

244
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,200
Guards.

245
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,519
Get the corpses out.

246
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,680
Wait.

247
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,359
Uncle.

248
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,280
I think

249
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,440
I've gone blind.

250
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,160
Assassins

251
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,040
and poisoned wine?

252
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,040
Any explanations?

253
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:30,888
Commander.

254
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,352
I swear I have no idea

255
00:15:33,352 --> 00:15:34,999
what happened here.

256
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,560
I know nothing

257
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,680
about the poison, either.

258
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,960
This happened in your mansion.

259
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:47,920
But your people

260
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,359
act completely innocent.

261
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,560
Isn't it ridiculous?

262
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,519
We don't know the dancers

263
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:57,800
and musicians.

264
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:59,119
They were hired.

265
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,296
Kneel.

266
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:05,280
- I...
- Kneel.

267
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,359
Kneel.

268
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:07,680
No matter what,

269
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,320
as head of the Sun family,

270
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:11,800
I failed to protect you

271
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,680
due to my negligence

272
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:15,440
and nearly caused a catastrophe.

273
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:17,359
I await your punishment, Commander.

274
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,239
Are you saying

275
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,479
that we should let this matter drop?

276
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,440
I dare not.

277
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,999
I'll get to the bottom of this.

278
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,519
All assassins took poison

279
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,160
and dropped dead.

280
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,800
I'm not leaving until

281
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:36,080
I find the truth.

282
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,800
I'll help you investigate,

283
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:39,320
Mr. Sun.

284
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,879
Commander Xiao is right.

285
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:45,839
As a witness,

286
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,999
I'm also obligated

287
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,200
to uncover the truth

288
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,759
and catch the culprit.

289
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:56,160
I appreciate it, Inspector.

290
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,440
How do you feel?

291
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:19,759
It's hurting less.

292
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,039
I'm just not used to it.

293
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,640
Earlier,

294
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,960
I requested

295
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,039
some soothing cream.

296
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,759
It should arrive soon.

297
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:33,319
Commander.

298
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,680
Don't worry about me.

299
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,559
Xiao Jue.

300
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,360
Are you feeling sorry for me?

301
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:50,519
Maybe you even feel guilty.

302
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,079
But actually,

303
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,600
you should praise me.

304
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,640
For what?

305
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,120
For being remarkable, obviously.

306
00:17:58,759 --> 00:17:59,440
If I hadn't

307
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,880
stopped you from having the wine,

308
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,400
you'd be dead now.

309
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,440
I'm basically your lifesaver.

310
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,840
Isn't that impressive?

311
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:10,799
You don't seem distressed

312
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,400
about losing your sight.

313
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,880
Possibly forever.

314
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:26,920
(She's scared.)

315
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,759
(She's not as casual)

316
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,559
(as she appears.)

317
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:34,824
The blind aren't all the same.

318
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:36,640
With my capabilities,

319
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,960
I'll surely become

320
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:39,920
the most

321
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,039
formidable blind person.

322
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:49,840
What

323
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,160
happened tonight?

324
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,759
Did you

325
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:55,960
plot all this?

326
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,440
Well...

327
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,120
How can you be such a fool?

328
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,759
And you.

329
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,960
How dare you act so recklessly?

330
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:13,400
What should I

331
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,479
tell General Feihong?

332
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,239
Unless

333
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,719
he sent you here exactly for this.

334
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,719
Please, Mr. Chu.

335
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:30,759
Though we acted on our own,

336
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:31,799
it was solely

337
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,160
for the Chancellor's sake.

338
00:19:33,832 --> 00:19:34,408
You see.

339
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,680
Everyone here knows

340
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,039
that I work for the Chancellor.

341
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:37,999
Xiao Jue came

342
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,039
and humiliated me.

343
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,440
He's not coming after me.

344
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,759
He's after Mr. Xu!

345
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:42,360
Mr. Sun.

346
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,160
Your arrogance astounds me.

347
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,039
Yezhou barely contains

348
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,079
your inflated ego.

349
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,680
Please forgive me.

350
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:06,239
I don't care

351
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,079
what you do.

352
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,352
Anyway,

353
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,880
if Master's reputation suffers damage,

354
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:13,200
both you and I

355
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,039
will be held accountable.

356
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:16,479
It won't happen.

357
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:19,640
Rest assured.

358
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,719
Xiao Jue will not

359
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,200
leave Yezhou alive.

360
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,960
I dare not cause the Chancellor

361
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,079
any trouble.

362
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:27,360
I will make sure there are

363
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,360
no loose ends.

364
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:36,999
Take care, Mr. Chu.

365
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,200
We underestimated

366
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,960
Xiao Jue's martial prowess.

367
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,319
And that Cheng Lisu...

368
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:57,719
He spilled the wine

369
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:00,239
way too conveniently.

370
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,880
I think I have

371
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,719
seen him somewhere.

372
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,319
Commander.

373
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:18,279
Won't you look into

374
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,840
the assassination?

375
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:21,559
How did assassins

376
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,319
infiltrate the Sun Mansion?

377
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,759
Are the Suns truly innocent?

378
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:28,920
I came to ask for military funding

379
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,160
and consolidate control over

380
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:32,319
officials and merchants.

381
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:33,640
I can't

382
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:35,279
confront the Sun family

383
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,999
just yet.

384
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,810
(Great Virtue)

385
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:53,319
Don't move.

386
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:10,978
♪Constant yearning,
still vivid as our first meeting♪

387
00:22:12,008 --> 00:22:15,680
♪Endless gazing.
Step by step, falling deeper♪

388
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,319
Does it hurt?

389
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,408
No.

390
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,239
I'm used to it.

391
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:23,239
Just hand me the cup.

392
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:32,986

Not really.

It's just that

Rest now.

424
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:48,400
I'll be right here

425
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,519
for you.

426
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,479
As you said, Commander,

427
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,519
the assassination must be linked

428
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,479
to Sun Xiangfu.

429
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,120
And the servant was

430
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,120
highly suspicious.

431
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,488
That's right.

432
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,039
This is our chance

433
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,120
to infiltrate them

434
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,519
and get to

435
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,279
the bottom of everything.

436
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:17,759
I discovered a hidden chamber here

437
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,120
last time.

438
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:20,680
The tax ledger

439
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:21,719
is likely hidden there.

440
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,360
But I was in a rush

441
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:24,400
and the chamber was

442
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:26,440
heavily guarded, so...

443
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:27,360
It's fine.

444
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:29,120
Since we are living here,

445
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,039
we'll find a chance.

446
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,400
But He Yan

447
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,360
was implicated.

448
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:06,360
(Xiao Jue is even more of a trouble
than I imagined,)

449
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:08,400
(closing in step by step.)

450
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,840
(We must hide the tax ledger well.)

451
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:13,640
(Tax Ledger)

452
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,920
(If Xiao Jue figures out)

453
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:16,519
(that the tax records)

454
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:17,559
(are falsified,)

455
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:19,279
(we're finished.)

456
00:26:36,424 --> 00:26:37,607
(Account Book)

457
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,400
(My life depends on this.)

458
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,719
(As long as I hold on to this,)

459
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,560
(Mr. Xu won't let anything)

460
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,680
(happen to me.)

461
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:58,799
(Otherwise,)

462
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,640
(I'll drag him down with me.)

463
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,880
(How dare Chu Zhao)

464
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,719
(boss me around, acting arrogantly?)

465
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,440
(I must remind him.)

466
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:17,840
That he himself

467
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,360
is merely another one of Mr. Xu's

468
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:24,160
lackeys.

469
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,440
Have some porridge.

470
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:43,920
Thank you, Uncle.

471
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,279
You've worked hard.

472
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:47,279
I don't mind taking care

473
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,719
of my nephew.

474
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,120
Then could you please

475
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,400
get me some side dishes

476
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,479
for the porridge?

477
00:27:59,079 --> 00:27:59,880
And perhaps some

478
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,559
family discipline.

479
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,440
Open up.

480
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,120
Commander.

481
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,479
Mr. Cheng.

482
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:09,920
This is

483
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,799
our most famous

484
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:11,680
and best oculist

485
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,999
in Yezhou.

486
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,479
Physician, you're finally here.

487
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,239
This morning,

488
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,039
I had cassia seeds

489
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,039
with white peony root.

490
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:23,360
I feel much better now.

491
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,400
Please examine me.

492
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:25,360
Good.

493
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:27,880
Cassia seeds do improve vision.

494
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,239
But still,

495
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,279
let me

496
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,440
examine you properly.

497
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:17,559
(She can see?)

498
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,160
Physician.

499
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,160
We're both physicians.

500
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,039
While cassia seeds improve vision,

501
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:30,840
combining with white peony roots

502
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,479
causes abdominal discomfort.

503
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,759
As a physician,

504
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,640
surely you know this?

505
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:45,160
You're right, Mr. Cheng.

506
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,200
I am

507
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,519
getting senile

508
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:48,519
and confused.

509
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,759
I almost made a grave mistake.

510
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:52,079
It's alright.

511
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:53,880
Just prescribe me something

512
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,999
more effective.

513
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:56,719
But

514
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:57,719
make it less bitter.

515
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:01,120
Do as he says.

516
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:02,799
Alright.

517
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,200
(That powder was strong.)

518
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:25,120
(I did lose my vision)

519
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:26,680
(when it got into my eyes.)

520
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:28,880
(Without the drug)

521
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,759
(Master left me,)

522
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,719
(I'd be blind again.)

523
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:34,840
(Since they think I'm blind,)

524
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,799
(I'll play along)

525
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:38,759
(to lower their guard)

526
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,759
(for our plan.)

527
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,200
(After all,)

528
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,840
(nobody guards against a blind person.)

529
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:07,759
(Let's see how long)

530
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,120
(you'll keep this act.)

531
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,160
(Did he)

532
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:17,440
(notice something?)

533
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,319
Brewing medicine takes time.

534
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:27,519
Go get some air.

535
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:31,079
Alright.

536
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,559
Proxy kill was my plan.

537
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:37,200
Too bad the proxy's an idiot.

538
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:39,120
Now the enemy is alerted.

539
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,200
Time's running out.

540
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,239
Locate the hidden ledger of Sun Xiangfu

541
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,039
and Master's dealings quickly.

542
00:31:44,744 --> 00:31:45,352
Understood.

543
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,440
Mind the step.

544
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,600
(Peace and Prosperity)

545
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:08,200
It hurts!

546
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,120
Commander's waist is indeed slender.

547
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:18,440
That's enough.

548
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:22,960
Uncle.

549
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:24,319
Where are we going?

550
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,680
Would I abandon you?

551
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,600
Just follow me.

552
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,640
Uncle?

553
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,640
Uncle.

554
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,200
Uncle!

555
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:03,600
Unbelievable!

556
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,239
He actually left me alone.

557
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:15,239
Hey! Someone!

558
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,759
I can't see.

559
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,640
I'm blind. I'm lost.

560
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,400
Hey! Help!

561
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,400
Where am I?

562
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,559
What is this place?

563
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:23,400
No entry here.

564
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:24,039
W-Who are you?

565
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:24,640
Go back now.

566
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:26,160
Why are you pulling me?

567
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:27,640
Do you know who I am?

568
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,719
Why are you pulling me?

569
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:29,519
Let go.

570
00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:32,279
Stop pulling me.

571
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,840
I'm blind. You're bullying me.

572
00:33:36,239 --> 00:33:37,479
I'm lost.

573
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,279
Take me back, will you?

574
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,120
Find my uncle.

575
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,319
(The top part's way smoother)

576
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,160
(than the rest.)

577
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,240
(Someone touches it very often.)

578
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,320
Let go. I can walk.

579
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:32,999
Young Master.

580
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:33,880
Get lost.

581
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,559
Why should I

582
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:36,440
visit Xiao Jue?

583
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,599
I'm not going.

584
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:39,280
I'd rather go to sleep.

585
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:40,679
(Oh no.)

586
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,639
(Sun Ling is back.)

587
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,800
(The mechanism is so complex.)

588
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:49,840
(It only opens if I pull)

589
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:51,079
(the copper strips)

590
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:51,960
(in the right order.)

591
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,720
(A single mistake)

592
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,920
(might destroy what's in there.)

593
00:36:02,178 --> 00:36:04,360
(Fortune and Blessing)

594
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:05,079
I...

595
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,240
I can walk.

596
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,039
I'm going back.

597
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:08,400
I-I remember.

598
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:08,960
This way.

599
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,440
Stop.

600
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,079
No way.

601
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:10,920
What do you mean?

602
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:12,639
My room's over there.

603
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,760
Why's it so messy?

604
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,999
Let go.

605
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,240
This way.

606
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,440
Someone was in my room.

607
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:18,800
Let me go.

608
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,679
Stop pushing me.

609
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,720
That old man is so annoying,

610
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,280
hiding his stuff in my room

611
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:43,800
and barging in uninvited.

612
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,199
I swear I'll move out.

613
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,679
I'm the guest of honor

614
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,280
your master invited.

615
00:36:50,479 --> 00:36:51,720
Alright, Cheng Lisu.

616
00:36:51,999 --> 00:36:53,440
We'll settle all our scores now.

617
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:54,440
Let me go.

618
00:36:58,639 --> 00:36:59,999
They're killing me.

619
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,840
The servants are killing me.

620
00:37:01,999 --> 00:37:03,240
Why are you pushing me?

621
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,400
You trying to kill me?

622
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,479
Now I'm "pushing".

623
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,639
Got it?

624
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,999
I thought it was someone unworthy,

625
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:14,720
but it's Young Master Sun.

626
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:16,280
- Stop!
- You...

627
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:19,240
Mr. Chu.

628
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:21,039
Is this how you

629
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:21,920
treat your guests?

630
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,119
Inspector.

631
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,400
You okay?

632
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:26,920
Everything's fine.

633
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,040
A misunderstanding.

634
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,360
I saw Mr. Cheng

635
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,079
struggling

636
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:31,639
and tried to help.

637
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,880
But I was too rough

638
00:37:34,479 --> 00:37:35,760
and ended up hurting him.

639
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:37,639
Since you hurt him

640
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:38,479
by mistake,

641
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,199
you should apologize

642
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:41,400
to Mr. Cheng.

643
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,240
Of course.

644
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,519
My apologies.

645
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:52,119
Mr. Cheng, I hope you could

646
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,519
forgive me.

647
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,199
For the inspector's sake,

648
00:37:58,639 --> 00:37:59,800
I'll let it slide.

649
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,079
Since you talked it out,

650
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,639
I'll walk Mr. Cheng back.

651
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,440
I appreciate it, Inspector.

652
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:07,624
This way.

653
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:13,160
Alright.

654
00:38:13,896 --> 00:38:14,504
Let's go.

655
00:38:25,479 --> 00:38:25,999
Be careful.

656
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:35,599
Are you okay?

657
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:36,680
I'm fine.

658
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,720
I'm fine.

659
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,479
I just stumbled a bit.

660
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:40,720
Inspector.

661
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:42,199
I can walk by myself.

662
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:43,208
See?

663
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,240
I can manage.

664
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:50,999
I thought

665
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,159
you'd be more casual,

666
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:53,999
but you really observe propriety.

667
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,159
As the saying goes,

668
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:57,479
"A noble man

669
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,240
conducts himself
with unwavering integrity

670
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:01,559
and propriety."

671
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,519
Careful, steps ahead.

672
00:39:05,864 --> 00:39:06,472
Alright.

673
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,440
I got this.

674
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:18,248
(Great Virtue)

675
00:39:18,248 --> 00:39:18,800
We're here.

676
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,559
Inspector.

677
00:39:20,872 --> 00:39:21,480
Come in.

678
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:31,599
Be careful.

679
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:32,968
I'm fine.

680
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:34,088
I'm fine.

681
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:39,400
Suit yourself, Inspector.

682
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:47,639
Let me.

683
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,999
"Inspector" sounds

684
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:57,960
way too distant.

685
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:01,679
In that case,

686
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,039
I'll boldly

687
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,440
address you as Mr. Chu.

688
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,440
Very good.

689
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,720
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

690
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,440
Where does that come from?

691
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:15,920
Some things transcend words.

692
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,960
I bet you understand. Mr. Chu.

693
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,760
If you say so,

694
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,559
then I suppose I do.

695
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,920
Mr. Chu.

696
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,720
Mr. Sun would like to see you.

697
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,280
Attend to your duties, Mr. Chu.

698
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:41,519
Rest well.
