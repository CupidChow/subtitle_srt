1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let me run to the next level

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Go through the snowfall

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Climb over the high mountains

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hold my hand and I will live for love

5
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Like a song

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,040
The background music

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,320
Before leaving together,

8
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,920
when we were young and young,

9
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,320
we really thought that

10
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,680
Little belated love

11
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,280
was waiting for us.

12
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,360
Come here,

13
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,640
come, instance.

14
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,400
Zhen Shao,

15
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,000
Who sent the gold-wrapped medicine?

16
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,000
She's not only tough,

17
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,880
but also smart.

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,840
She's indeed a tough opponent.

19
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,400
Anyway,

20
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,840
He Yan is definitely not a good person.

21
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,880
Why don't we arrest her first?

22
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,920
No hurry.

23
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,440
Do you have a plan?

24
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,120
This group of new recruits

25
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,200
has been training for a month.

26
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,200
It's time for them to compete.

27
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,920
By then,

28
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,040
we'll naturally see the results.

29
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,760
I'll tell you a secret.

30
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,080
Actually, except me,

31
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,200
there's another Wu Ming Shi

32
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
who also arrested you.

33
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,600
He also got a lot of dry cakes.

34
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,720
I guess

35
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,360
it's either Brother Huang or Xiao Mai.

36
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
So, look.

37
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,920
Except for your good brother,

38
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,480
I'm the one who likes you the most.

39
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,600
So am I

40
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,920
your good brother?

41
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,200
I'm not.

42
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,080
But I'm also your good brother.

43
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,640
Yes, you are.

44
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,040
Of course.

45
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,080
Brother,

46
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,440
let me ask you something.

47
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,720
Go ahead.

48
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,320
Do you think

49
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,160
I have a good chance to join 97 Battalion?

50
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,040
With your talent,

51
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,080
I think you have a good chance.

52
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,520
Really?

53
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,400
Of course.

54
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,080
But you don't have to.

55
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,200
Why?

56
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,480
That 97 Battalion

57
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,680
is playing with Xiao Jue.

58
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,960
Don't you know that?

59
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,640
You all know that

60
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,400
Xiao Jue

61
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,960
is usually very normal.

62
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,080
But when he starts to fight,

63
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,560
he's not normal anymore.

64
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,200
He's still young.

65
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,480
He's not good enough to play with Xiao Jue.

66
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,080
Right?

67
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,800
Yes.

68
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,000
With his talent,

69
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,600
I think

70
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,400
he's a good match.

71
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,000
Where are you going?

72
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,080
Be careful.

73
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,680
Come on.

74
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,480
Let's go.

75
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,320
Let's go.

76
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,600
New soldiers, He Yan.

77
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,920
I want to see the governor.

78
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,760
The governor asked me to tell you

79
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,000
to go inside now.

80
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,160
This way.

81
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,400
Go.

82
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,720
Let me call you in.

83
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,480
I'm here to thank you

84
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,040
No

85
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,200
It's you

86
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,720
Thanks for your guidance and guidance

87
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,240
I can...

88
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,440
You have thanked me for my kindness

89
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,720
I won

90
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,480
It's all because of you

91
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,640
I'm here to thank you

92
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,760
So I have to drink this cup of tea

93
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,360
Assistant

94
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,760
Assistant

95
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,840
It'sFine

96
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,640
뚫 Los senño

97
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,920
and divided the cakes.

98
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,320
Childe Cheng said

99
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
that apart from him,

100
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,200
a nameless man also suppressed me.

101
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,360
So that man

102
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,720
is you, Du Du.

103
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,840
So Du Du also bought me a win.

104
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,520
That means he likes me.

105
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,400
No wonder.

106
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,920
After all, I was also handed over by you.

107
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,960
Don't be so arrogant.

108
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,760
Du Du, look.

109
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,120
Since I won so many cakes for you,

110
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,120
shouldn't you give me some rewards?

111
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,720
Rewards?

112
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,040
What reward do you want?

113
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,680
Du Du, am I qualified to join the 97th Battalion?

114
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,800
You just won two new soldiers

115
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,840
and dreamt of joining the 97th Battalion.

116
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,360
What do you think the 97th Battalion is?

117
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,400
Then, Du Du, why don't you check me again?

118
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,360
I won't let you down.

119
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,760
Okay.

120
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,280
Since you said so,

121
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,760
I will definitely check you.

122
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,920
New soldiers have been trained for a month.

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,800
It's time for you to separate.

124
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,720
In the mid-autumn,

125
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
you will compete for the flag.

126
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,920
What?

127
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,880
What is this?

128
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,600
What is this?

129
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,280
What is this?

130
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,920
What is this?

131
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,520
What is this?

132
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,200
What is this?

133
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,720
What is this?

134
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,440
What is this?

135
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,200
What is this?

136
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,600
In the whole Mount Baiyue,

137
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,320
you will put on 15 flags.

138
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,480
You will be divided into different teams.

139
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,240
During the specified time,

140
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,080
the team with the most flags

141
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,400
will be the winner.

142
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,240
The winning team

143
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
will get twice the military reward this month.

144
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,560
The military reward will also be doubled.

145
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,480
That's great.

146
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,360
That's great.

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,840
But before you compete for the flag,

148
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,800
you have to complete the tour first.

149
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,000
Next,

150
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,800
I will arrange the team's personnel.

151
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,240
Zheng Xuan.

152
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,840
Yes.

153
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,440
Jiang Jiao.

154
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,080
Yes.

155
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,600
Wang Ba.

156
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,280
Yes.

157
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,160
He Yan.

158
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,440
Yes.

159
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,120
Xiaomai.

160
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,040
Yes.

161
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,000
You five will be the team.

162
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,080
He Yan.

163
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,960
He Yan.

164
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,520
You will be the team leader.

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,840
Me?

166
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,640
From tomorrow,

167
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,120
you will go up the mountain to patrol.

168
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,400
Yes.

169
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,080
I've made a hole in myself.

170
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,120
Xiao Jue really

171
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,360
tested me well.

172
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,760
Is this medicine Xin Zan Fool?

173
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,040
Here you are.

174
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,680
Take it.

175
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,480
All horses can escape and drink water.

176
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,640
Can they still follow the mountains?

177
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,580
Guys,

178
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,340
shall I take this too?

179
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,540
No.

180
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,740
No, where is it?

181
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,040
That is too bad.

182
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,500
Brother,

183
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,540
wanna have another bite?

184
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,540
Uncle,

185
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,940
why don't we go to the one in the front?

186
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
We're a team.

187
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,280
We can't separate.

188
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,360
And, do you know the road ahead?

189
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,960
I...

190
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,080
Brother, let's go.

191
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,120
We'll go and come back.

192
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,680
We're here to play some wild games.

193
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,040
I'll give you this.

194
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,640
Let's go.

195
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,760
Brother He, just let them go.

196
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,040
This king father is your subordinate.

197
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,360
It's not good to stay here.

198
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,880
Just let them go.

199
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,480
I'm not going to let them go.

200
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,320
They're so fast.

201
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,560
Just let them go.

202
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,800
Brother He,

203
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,120
why aren't they back yet?

204
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,080
They?

205
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,800
Maybe the wild beasts took them away this morning.

206
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,880
Run!

207
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,360
Run!

208
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,600
What's going on?

209
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,280
Where's king father?

210
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,880
Hurry.

211
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,080
He's in the wolf's den.

212
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,760
He's been bitten by the wolf.

213
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,680
The wolf saved him.

214
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,360
You two did a good thing.

215
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,400
Enough.

216
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:54,960
No.

217
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,280
Stop fighting.

218
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,640
Stop fighting.

219
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,160
Brother He, where are you going?

220
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,080
Go back to the camp and beg.

221
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,800
I'll go find king father.

222
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,200
It's too dangerous for you to go alone.

223
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,000
Brother He.

224
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,800
There are many people here.

225
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,280
Hurry up.

226
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,680
Zheng Xuan, you bastard.

227
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,520
I...

228
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,640
You...

229
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,760
Stop right there.

230
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,400
Stop right there.

231
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,040
Lo какиеeminà du b repair?

232
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,400
Stop.

233
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,680
Let go of me.

234
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,480
You stupid aio.

235
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,960
Let go of me.

236
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,360
I will give it back to them.

237
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,880
Even if I have to lose a neck,

238
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,560
Let's go.

239
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,440
You...

240
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,680
You alone...

241
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,360
It's none of your business.

242
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,280
I can do anything.

243
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,160
Xiao Chen.

244
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,840
Go!

245
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,360
Do I need to die?

246
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,880
I once had a close relationship with you.

247
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,880
I once had a pair of eyes.

248
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,880
I could only see through them.

249
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
Now I think about it.

250
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
The past me,

251
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,880
I was always there for you.

252
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,880
The Royal Family's Beauty Jiang Er

253
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,880
is inviting you to continue watching.

254
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,880
What did you say?

255
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,880
He Yan ran away?

256
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
I didn't expect that

257
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
He Yan

258
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,880
He Yan had the intention to betray us.

259
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,880
He even sent us to escape together.

260
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,880
He said that if we turn the mountain over,

261
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,880
even if the police sent someone to chase us, there's no way.

262
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,880
I'm a loyal person.

263
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,880
I won't let him go.

264
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
Instructor Shen

265
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
Instructor Shen

266
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,880
Xiao Mai, Jiang Jiao and Wang Ba are back.

267
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
Zheng Xuan

268
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
You're a mouthless girl.

269
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
You're really a mouthless girl.

270
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,880
It's not me.

271
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
Zheng Xuan, this bastard

272
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,880
ran away before he left.

273
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,880
He wanted to kill us.

274
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,880
What?

275
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,880
When Xiao Mai said he refused,

276
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
please teach him to be my master.

277
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,880
Teach him.

278
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,880
None of you dare to take risks.

279
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
None of you dare to go.

280
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,880
I'm not afraid of you.

281
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
I'm not afraid of you.

282
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
I'm not afraid of you.

283
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
I'm not afraid of you.

284
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
I'm not afraid of you.

285
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
I'm not afraid of you.

286
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,880
I'm not afraid of you.

287
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
I dare not go.

288
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
I'll go by myself.

289
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
I grew up in the mountains.

290
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,880
I'm not afraid of those animals.

291
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,880
I'll go by myself.

292
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
Duoduo

293
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
Shen Han

294
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
Take care of your soldiers.

295
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,880
Yes

296
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,880
Duoduo, how about I take you to the mountain?

297
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,880
No need.

298
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,880
The terrain on the mountain is complicated.

299
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,880
It's dangerous.

300
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,880
I'll go by myself.

301
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,880
Duoduo

302
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,880
Actually, this place is quite good.

303
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,880
Jiajia Qi, Jiao Wang, Qiu Yue

304
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,880
Chuan Jin, Hong Si, Ji Wan Tiao

305
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
Today is the seventh day of the lunar calendar.

306
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,880
But it's not too bad.

307
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,880
After all, there is a dead wolf with me.

308
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
What?

309
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
You really want to go to the river with your lover

310
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,880
to make a boat and celebrate the seventh day of the lunar calendar?

311
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,880
Duoduo

312
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,880
Duoduo

313
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,880
Duoduo, why are you here?

314
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,880
Can you come up by yourself?

315
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
Duoduo

316
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,880
I can't.

317
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
Duoduo

318
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
Duoduo

319
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
Duoduo

320
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,880
Hold on tight.

321
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
Come

322
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,880
Duoduo

323
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,880
Duoduo

324
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
You killed a batch of wolves with your bare hands.

325
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
Not only that

326
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,880
you even helped your companions to retreat at a critical moment.

327
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,880
I've never seen a new soldier like you who has the courage.

328
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,880
Life and death are related.

329
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
Duoduo

330
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,880
You are so willing to see such a great warrior

331
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,880
who is in his prime and is going to see King of Yan.

332
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Duoduo usually

333
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
taught us this way.

334
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
You mean

335
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,880
I force you to see King of Yan?

336
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,880
I won't go.

337
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,880
King of Yan

338
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
is not as good as us.

339
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,880
Duoduo

340
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,880
Shall we go back now?

341
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,880
You want to stay here for the night?

342
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
No, no.

343
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
I mean

344
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,880
there is no one else here.

345
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,880
Only one horse.

346
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
So?

347
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,880
So

348
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
you don't want me

349
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,880
to follow the horse back?

350
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,880
Oh my god.

351
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,880
I'm so miserable.

352
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,880
Why am I so miserable?

353
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,880
Go to bed.

354
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
Me?

355
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
If you want to go back

356
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,880
it's not impossible.

357
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,880
No, no, no.

358
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,880
I can do it.

359
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
I'm so happy.

360
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,880
Does it hurt?

361
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,880
It's just a small wound.

362
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,880
Wait.

363
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,880
What's wrong?

364
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
Duoduo

365
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,880
Look at that wolf.

366
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
I finally killed it.

367
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,880
It's a pity to leave it here.

368
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
What do you want?

369
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,880
How about

370
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
putting it on?

371
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,880
Okay.

372
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,880
Really?

373
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,880
Duoduo, you are a good man.

374
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
When it comes up

375
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,880
you go down.

376
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,880
I didn't say that.

377
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,880
Duoduo

378
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,880
I want to touch your sword.

379
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
Didn't you touch it last time?

380
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,880
Good sword.

381
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,880
It's really a good sword.

382
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
You can keep quiet.

383
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,880
But Duoduo

384
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,880
if I don't talk

385
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,880
I'll be bored to death.

386
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,880
Duoduo

387
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,880
I'm sorry.

388
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,880
I'm sorry.

389
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,880
I'm sorry.

390
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,880
Duoduo

391
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
Actually, you don't have to be so serious.

392
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,880
Think about it.

393
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,880
I killed a wolf

394
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,880
but I didn't take it away.

395
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,880
That's not a good deal

396
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,880
for the foxes in the mountain.

397
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,880
Not to mention eating meat

398
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,880
the wolf skin is also very good.

399
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
Wolf skin can make a big factory.

400
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
Of course

401
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,880
Duoduo doesn't like it.

402
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,880
That's not just a good deal for me.

403
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,880
If I have a

404
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,880
big factory made of wolf skin

405
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,880
in winter

406
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,880
I can play in the snow.

407
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,880
You like wolf skin so much.

408
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,880
You like wolf skin so much.

409
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,880
No wonder

410
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,880
you held the wolf

411
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
in the pit just now.

412
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,880
That's not it.

413
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,880
I'm just too cold.

414
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
I know

415
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,880
Duoduo loves to rob.

416
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
He doesn't like dirty things.

417
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,880
He won't let the blood of the animals

418
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,880
stick to Duoduo.

419
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,880
But I'm different.

420
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,880
Not to mention the dead wolf.

421
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,880
I've been lying in the dead man's pile.

422
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,880
When?

423
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,880
When I was a child

424
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,880
people had Hongli

425
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:30,280
his aim for ни qi was to rope his

426
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,880
hair down and remove it.

427
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
Although a reasons

428
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,120
continual

429
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,880
I don't think it's possible.

430
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,880
Li Hongra leading a race

431
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,360
took Meili's set of

432
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,140
It's hard for me to forget this chess song

433
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,860
What a beautiful티

434
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,480
Listen ,

435
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,480
a woman,

436
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,880
a woman,

437
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,440
但是 削不去 军 camera all female.

438
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,720
What's the motive of her?

439
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,520
Jeez!

440
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,020
Ray portrait

441
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,080
流的血

442
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,560
and all these

443
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,320
腹部和腹部

444
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,460
脾气 haben

445
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,900
腹乎چ

446
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,180
脾气

447
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,280
可以

448
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,840
流的血

449
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,940
He Yan.

450
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,660
He Yan.

451
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,700
Well,

452
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:35,860
I...

453
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,820
Leave when you wake up.

454
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,660
Shen Han, help him down.

455
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,060
Find Cheng Lisu to treat his wound.

456
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,260
Yes.

457
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,460
This knife is so sharp.

458
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,140
It hasn't changed at all.

459
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,140
What did you say?

460
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,100
What did you say?

461
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,220
Nothing.

462
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,740
Nothing.

463
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,700
Come on, He Yan.

464
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,420
Come on.

465
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,660
Why is it so heavy?

466
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,100
Are you okay?

467
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,860
No, no, no.

468
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,540
Slowly.

469
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,820
Duoduo, you're back.

470
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,100
How is He Yan?

471
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:14,900
He's still alive.

472
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,860
When I found him,

473
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,500
the wolf killed him.

474
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,300
He killed a wolf with one strike?

475
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,460
He's really something.

476
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,300
He's really something.

477
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,620
He Yan didn't save his comrades.

478
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,900
He didn't care about his own safety.

479
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,860
If he did, he wouldn't do that.

480
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,700
Can we clear his suspicion?

481
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,420
We need to observe him.

482
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,980
Duoduo, how to deal with Zheng Xuan?

483
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,820
A soldier can die under the sword of the enemy.

484
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,980
But he can't die in the same sword.

485
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,140
Zheng Xuan, kill him.

486
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:55,980
Yes.

487
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,740
What?

488
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,580
Zheng Xuan was killed by a demon?

489
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,300
Xiao Jue is so strict.

490
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,300
Bear with it.

491
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:10,860
Come on.

492
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,260
What about the others?

493
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,500
The king's father went over the mountain.

494
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,020
The soldiers can't escape.

495
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,220
As for Jiang Jiao and Xiao Mai,

496
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,460
although they didn't do anything serious,

497
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,300
Huaijin said they abandoned their comrades and fled.

498
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,340
They should be punished.

499
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,060
So they led the soldiers to escape.

500
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,340
It's a big deal.

501
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,260
Do you think

502
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,820
Huaijin is too cruel?

503
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,900
I don't have to speak for him.

504
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,020
I think...

505
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:40,900
Actually...

506
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,820
There's a rule in the army.

507
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,020
You can't break it.

508
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,860
Zheng Xuan is a soldier.

509
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,980
He doesn't follow the rules.

510
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,620
He's a man of no morals.

511
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,380
If he goes to the battlefield in the future,

512
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,380
who dares to entrust his descendants to him?

513
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,900
Now the Yezhou Guards are in danger.

514
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,660
Duoduo wants to kill a man to prove the rules.

515
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,020
Although the demon battle is cruel,

516
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,740
it's also a helpless move to shoot the soldiers.

517
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,140
I think Duoduo

518
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,860
made up his mind after thinking about it.

519
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,140
I didn't expect you, a new soldier,

520
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,620
to say such a thing.

521
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,180
You're a general.

522
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,020
I'm going to be a general.

523
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,580
I need to know more.

524
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,100
You're right.

525
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,420
Take off your clothes.

526
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,300
What?

527
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,260
Why are you reacting like this?

528
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,580
You're not a girl.

529
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,740
If you didn't see our friendship

530
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,340
and Huaijin's entrust,

531
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,220
I'm a good soldier.

532
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,820
How could I treat a man?

533
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,500
Don't bother.

534
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,900
I'll wipe my wounds myself.

535
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,420
Why are you being polite to me?

536
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,220
Do you have any hidden feelings?

537
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,940
You can't be a girl.

538
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,260
Come on, let me help you.

539
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,060
Well...

540
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,300
Actually, I...

541
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,300
I'm a married woman.

542
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,820
I can't see anyone.

543
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,900
Brother He, you're too hard to deal with.

544
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,900
But it's a serious matter.

545
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,860
I believe you won't mind.

546
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:05,460
Come on.

547
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,060
You want to protect your fiancée, right?

548
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,580
Brother He,

549
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,140
you know nothing about beating people.

550
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,620
You're going to ruin my face.

551
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,620
I'm sorry.

552
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,420
If she wants to protect her fiancée,

553
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,900
let her do it.

554
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,060
Qingmu, you've missed something.

555
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,980
You'll be disappointed.

556
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:42,940
Brother He,

557
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,060
you've caught Huaijin's eye.

558
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,540
What do you mean?

559
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,220
The golden medicine is so expensive.

560
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,340
Huaijin doesn't even use it.

561
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,380
For so many years,

562
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,940
it's been given to two people.

563
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,020
One is you,

564
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,100
the other is...

565
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,020
a white-eyed wolf.

566
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,780
White-eyed wolf?

567
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,500
Forget it.

568
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,780
Don't follow him.

569
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:03,980
Who?

570
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,420
Who else can it be except He Rufi?

571
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,580
You mean He Rufi?

572
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:10,900
Yes.

573
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,620
You...

574
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,220
He Rufi is a white-eyed wolf now.

575
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,940
But he wasn't like that before.

576
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,820
It's him.

577
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,500
Could it be that he's a...

578
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,260
A man who's not a man?

579
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,380
A man's heart is like a needle in the sea.

580
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,940
It seems that I know him

581
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,740
not enough.

582
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,380
I wonder what Xiao Xue has been through.

583
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,940
I don't know.

584
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,140
I don't know.

585
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,340
I don't know.

586
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,540
I don't know.

587
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,780
I don't know.

588
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,980
I don't know.

589
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,180
I don't know.

590
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:15,420
That's why I used such a cruel method like the Demon Slayer.

591
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,260
Master.

592
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,500
I'm here today

593
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:50,020
to light a lamp for my sister He Yan.

594
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,340
Amitabha.

595
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,500
But this lamp is different from the other lamps.

596
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,060
What kind of lamp do you want?

597
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,180
This lamp will shake her soul.

598
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,140
It's buns.

599
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,180
This is water.

600
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,940
I heard that Xiao Huai ji

601
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,620
has been doing well

602
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,740
for the first time at Yezhou City.

603
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,020
He has been doing well

604
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,700
to send out a new soldier.

605
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,980
Although he's working for me,

606
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,220
he's far away from me.

607
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,500
After the Emperor's death,

608
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:49,140
he's also given birth to an unworthy son.

609
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,820
Do you have any concerns?

610
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,140
I once had a daughter.

611
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,180
I've been waiting for her to escape violence.

612
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,300
So I've had some money to spend.

613
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,700
But I'm afraid that she's been

614
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,660
secretly making money.

615
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,100
Prime Minister, Mr. Chu,

616
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,420
General Fei Hong is here.

617
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,780
He Ru Fei?

618
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,380
I remember that he's always been alone

619
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,660
and far from the bandits.

620
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,580
I suddenly came to visit him today.

621
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,660
Zi Lan.

622
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,660
Today, I have some people

623
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,300
to entertain him for me.

624
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,420
I will obey.

625
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,420
General Fei Hong.

626
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,420
I've known you for a long time.

627
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,500
You're so handsome and handsome.

628
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,020
I'm so happy to see you today.

629
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,020
You're too kind, Mr. Chu.

630
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,220
But I just happened to cure the scars on my face.

631
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,820
I'm lucky that I didn't wear a mask.

632
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,420
Come.

633
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,540
General, please.

634
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,820
You're here.

635
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,940
I've been waiting for you.

636
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,060
I've been waiting for you.

637
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,180
I've been waiting for you.

638
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,300
I've been waiting for you.

639
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,420
I've been waiting for you.

640
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,540
I've been waiting for you.

641
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,660
I've been waiting for you.

642
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,660
Mr. Chu.

643
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,860
Why didn't you see Prime Minister Xu?

644
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,660
I have some business to attend to.

645
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,660
I'm here to entertain him.

646
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,580
Please don't mind me, General Fei Hong.

647
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,860
Prime Minister is busy with his work.

648
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,660
But Mr. Chu Si is very free.

649
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,260
He's drinking tea and pouring water in the Prime Minister's mansion

650
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,260
to learn the way to entertain guests.

651
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,900
Tea is good for your health

652
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,460
and it's good for your health.

653
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,660
General Fei Hong is here.

654
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:30,460
Don't you want to drink this cup of tea?

655
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,860
Mr. Chu Si is so wise.

656
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,660
I'm sure the tea is very good.

657
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,340
That's why Prime Minister Xu likes you so much.

658
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,340
Ding Yu.

659
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,940
I happened to get a water book from my uncle.

660
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,260
I'm here to give it to you.

661
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,700
Since he's busy,

662
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,180
I'd like to ask you to give it to him.

663
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,180
Thank you.

664
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,300
See you.

665
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,020
Why does this guard

666
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,820
look so skilled?

667
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,500
Zi Lan, sit.

668
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,300
Yes.

669
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,740
Zi Lan,

670
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,900
you're noodles.

671
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,660
Please help me.

672
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:37,420
What do you think about He Ru Fei?

673
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,460
I don't know if that's a military instruction or foreboding.

674
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,180
There are lots of evidences about him.

675
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,460
You'reilly and shameless.

676
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,260
Zi Lan thinks that this person came at the right time.

677
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,260
He has a bodyguard who is extremely skilled.

678
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,260
If someone else is involved,

679
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,060
he can deal with Xiao Jue

680
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,860
and also solve the problem of the Sun family.

681
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,460
Fine.

682
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,260
Since you already have an idea,

683
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:11,260
then you will arrange this matter.

684
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,860
Yes.

685
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,060
Father.

686
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,660
How is the old man of the Prime Minister?

687
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,260
Why didn't he let you eat today?

688
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,860
The Prime Minister is very good.

689
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,460
It's just a matter of official business.

690
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,260
I dare not disturb him.

691
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,860
You...

692
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,460
I have told you so many times.

693
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,260
You should stay by the old man of the Prime Minister's side more often

694
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,660
and be more close to him.

695
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,260
This is the first time I have ever seen you like this.

696
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,860
Forget it.

697
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,060
I should go out to attend the banquet.

698
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,060
You go back there and accompany your mother to eat.

699
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,860
I will obey.

700
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,460
Greetings, Mother.

701
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,260
Father asked me to accompany you to eat.

702
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,260
I have already prepared the meal.

703
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,260
I will go now.

704
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,060
Father asked me to accompany you to eat.

705
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,660
I have a bad appetite today.

706
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,660
I want to go back to my room and rest earlier.

707
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,660
You eat by yourself.

708
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,460
I obey.

709
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:31,660
You are really treating me like a father.

710
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,060
Although your biological mother is the eldest daughter of the Chu family,

711
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,860
who knows what your biological father's surname is?

712
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,860
If it wasn't for the honor of the Chu family,

713
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,860
why would your uncle adopt you, a nephew who is unrecognized?

714
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:46,660
Didn't you want your unmarried child,

715
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,460
a famous and bad biological mother, to enter the Chu family's ancestral hall?

716
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,660
Then you should have already been promoted to the position of the head of the family and become a phoenix.

717
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:59,660
In 맏安城 super tiny Clock Tower

718
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,660
Episode 1

719
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,340
Du Du!

720
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,060
We investigated for so long.

721
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,820
He Yan is not really a member of He Rufei or Xu Jingfu.

722
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,820
I can only say that it's not easy to help him hide his identity.

723
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,860
Hide his identity?

724
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,100
What did you find out, Commander?

725
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,660
It's an accident.

726
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,660
Let them continue to investigate.

727
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:41,660
Yes.

728
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:56,060
I just want to stay with you

729
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,140
and use my strength to shine

730
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:03,500
the light of existence.

731
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,660
I've seen the mountains and the mountains.

732
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,220
I've climbed over the ice.

733
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,660
I'm alone day and night.

734
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,860
It's fate and faith.

735
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:20,260
I'll light up the dreams I love.

736
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,260
Unworthy wishes are always forgotten.

737
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,860
Who cares about the wildness?

738
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,860
Wearing a warm dress,

739
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,060
I risk my life to protect my family.

740
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,860
Flying in the sky,

741
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,860
there will always be hope.

742
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:45,260
I'll overcome all the wounds and search for the light.

743
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,460
Chase after the light in the sea of stars.

744
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:51,460
Unworthy love, you create for me.
