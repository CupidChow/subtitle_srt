(Healing ointment?)

23
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:12,990
(Who sent this?)

24
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,296
=Episode 4=

25
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,150
He's not only persistent,

26
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:22,031
but also intelligent.

27
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:25,191
What a formidable opponent.

28
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:26,911
Anyway,

29
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:29,270
He Yan is definitely no good.

30
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,270
Shall I arrest him first?

31
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,670
No rush.

32
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:34,830
So you already have a plan?

33
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,311
These recruits

34
00:02:36,872 --> 00:02:38,710
have trained for a full month.

35
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:40,710
It's time for their banner competition.

36
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,670
Then

37
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:44,550
we'll see how it goes.

38
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:49,471
Let me tell you a secret.

39
00:02:50,351 --> 00:02:52,110
Actually, besides me,

40
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,990
someone anonymous
also bet on your victory.

41
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,240
He got many flatbreads too.

42
00:02:55,631 --> 00:02:56,471
I bet it's either

43
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,911
Huang Xiong or Mai.

44
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,710
So you see,

45
00:03:01,231 --> 00:03:02,830
besides your best buddies,

46
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,990
I'm your biggest supporter.

47
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,390
So doesn't that

48
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,430
make me your buddy, too?

49
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,270
Yeah.

50
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,550
It does.

51
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,710
Of course.

52
00:03:12,231 --> 00:03:13,071
Mr. Cheng,

53
00:03:13,191 --> 00:03:14,184
may I ask you something?

54
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,390
Go ahead.

55
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,110
What are my chances

56
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:18,990
of joining the Nine Banners Battalion,

57
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:20,031
in your opinion?

58
00:03:22,351 --> 00:03:23,751
Given your talents,

59
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:25,590
the chances are high.

60
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:27,471
Really?

61
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:28,311
Of course.

62
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,830
But is it really necessary?

63
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,151
Why not?

64
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,552
You'll follow Xiao Jue

65
00:03:32,552 --> 00:03:33,590
into deadly missions.

66
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,510
Didn't you know?

67
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:36,591
Everybody knows

68
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:38,511
that Xiao Jue may seem

69
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:39,870
perfectly composed,

70
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:41,351
but he loses it

71
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:42,430
during battles.

72
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,351
He Yan is still young.

73
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:46,191
Why should he
risk his life with Xiao Jue?

74
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:47,031
Totally.

75
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:47,911
With his talents,

76
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:48,791
I think

77
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,344
he should follow a safer path...

78
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:52,871
Where are you going?

79
00:03:53,511 --> 00:03:54,472
Be careful, it's hot.

80
00:03:54,472 --> 00:03:55,830
Dig in.

81
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,751
He Yan, the recruit,

82
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:02,856
is here to pay respect.

83
00:04:16,951 --> 00:04:17,830
You may enter.

84
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:28,511
You need something?

85
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:30,111
My buddies and I

86
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:31,590
were celebrating my success...

87
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,430
So?

88
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,824
So I came here

89
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:36,270
to thank you, Commander...

90
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:38,071
No,

91
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:38,951
Master.

92
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,710
Thanks to your guidance and teachings,

93
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,951
- I managed...
- Didn't you

94
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,150
already express your gratitude?

95
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,550
Commander,

96
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:50,150
I won all thanks to you.

97
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,390
I sincerely came to thank you.

98
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:53,751
So please

99
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,431
have this cup of tea.

100
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,790
You don't like tea?

101
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,230
How about

102
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:18,671
some night snacks first?

103
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:19,511
Stop.

104
00:05:28,488 --> 00:05:30,376
(Let me tell you a secret).

105
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:32,270
(Actually, besides me,)

106
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,600
(someone anonymous
also bet on your victory.)

107
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:36,072
(He got many flatbreads too.)

108
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,150
Mr. Cheng said

109
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:45,791
that apart from him,

110
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,150
someone anonymous also bet on me.

111
00:05:49,111 --> 00:05:50,248
So that person

112
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,590
was you, Commander?

113
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:00,991
You bet on me, too?

114
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:02,431
So you have faith in me?

115
00:06:03,616 --> 00:06:04,456
Makes sense.

116
00:06:04,456 --> 00:06:06,631
After all, I was trained by you.

117
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,710
Don't push it.

118
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:13,951
Commander,

119
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:14,791
look,

120
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,991
since I won you so many flatbreads,

121
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:18,830
shouldn't you give me some reward?

122
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:22,711
Reward?

123
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,830
What kind of reward?

124
00:06:26,431 --> 00:06:27,271
Commander.

125
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,416
Am I qualified
for the Nine Banners Battalion?

126
00:06:32,552 --> 00:06:34,350
You only managed to beat two recruits.

127
00:06:35,111 --> 00:06:36,551
And now you dare ask

128
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,910
to join the Nine Banners Battalion?

129
00:06:41,671 --> 00:06:42,511
Feel free

130
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:44,071
to evaluate my performance.

131
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:45,871
I won't let you down.

132
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:49,711
Very well.

133
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,071
Since you've said that,

134
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,431
I'll make sure to evaluate you properly.

135
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:05,864
A month has passed in your training.

136
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,270
It's time for you

137
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,551
to prove yourselves

138
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,910
at the Flag Contest before

139
00:07:12,511 --> 00:07:13,544
the Mid-Autumn Festival.

140
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:16,030
What does it mean?

141
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:18,271
We'll place

142
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,590
15 flags across Mount Baiyue

143
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,551
for this contest.

144
00:07:23,191 --> 00:07:25,751
You'll be divided into different teams.

145
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,511
Within the set timeframe,

146
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,551
the team obtaining the most flags

147
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:30,911
wins.

148
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,790
The winning team will receive

149
00:07:33,071 --> 00:07:34,910
double this month's pay

150
00:07:35,311 --> 00:07:36,151
and double

151
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,310
military merits.

152
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:38,191
That's great.

153
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,031
Awesome.

154
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,470
But before the contest,

155
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,390
you must patrol the mountains.

156
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,711
Next,

157
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,511
I'll assign you to different teams.

158
00:07:48,271 --> 00:07:49,470
- Zheng Xuan.
- Here!

159
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,590
- Jiang Jiao.
- Here!

160
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,976
- Wang Ba.
- Here!

161
00:07:52,424 --> 00:07:54,280
- He Yan.
- Here!

162
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:55,944
- Mai.
- Here!

163
00:07:56,551 --> 00:07:57,590
You guys form one team.

164
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,070
He Yan.

165
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,270
You'll be the captain.

166
00:08:01,951 --> 00:08:02,791
Me?

167
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:06,470
Starting tomorrow,

168
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:07,871
patrol the mountains.

169
00:08:08,551 --> 00:08:09,391
Understood.

170
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,790
(I've dug my own grave here.)

171
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,270
(Xiao Jue is really)

172
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,071
(putting me to the test.)

173
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:28,808
(Captain)

174
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,551
Horses get to rest and drink,

175
00:08:47,071 --> 00:08:48,671
while we keep patrolling.

176
00:09:07,031 --> 00:09:08,031
The flatbread is awful.

177
00:09:09,191 --> 00:09:10,536
Wang Ba.

178
00:09:10,536 --> 00:09:11,551
Want something tasty?

179
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:12,950
What do you mean?

180
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,271
Let's check ahead.

181
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:16,111
There might be

182
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,608
some rare fruits.

183
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,670
I'll pick some.

184
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,470
Or we can hunt for something.

185
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:24,311
- Alright.
- Let's go.

186
00:09:24,311 --> 00:09:25,736
That's the mountain ridge ahead.

187
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,830
The instructor

188
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,151
forbids us to cross.

189
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,071
Stay here if you're scared.

190
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,350
We'll be right back.

191
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,470
We're a team.

192
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,750
We shouldn't split up.

193
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,671
Also, do you know the terrain ahead?

194
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:37,631
I...

195
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:38,911
Wang Ba.

196
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:39,751
Are we going?

197
00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:42,391
We'll be right back.

198
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:45,110
We need something to eat.
The flatbread is tasteless.

199
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:46,350
Here, take this.

200
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:48,031
Let's go.

201
00:09:49,551 --> 00:09:50,391
He,

202
00:09:50,951 --> 00:09:52,031
let them be.

203
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:54,191
Wang Ba lost to you.

204
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,550
He feels humiliated

205
00:09:55,911 --> 00:09:56,751
to stay here.

206
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:58,120
Let them be.

207
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,430
He.

208
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:23,630
What's taking them so long?

209
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,670
They

210
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,551
might've been taken by wild beasts.

211
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,470
Bad news.

212
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,310
We're in trouble!

213
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,590
What happened?

214
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:36,871
Where's Wang Ba?

215
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:37,911
Hurry.

216
00:10:37,911 --> 00:10:38,751
Wang Ba was bitten

217
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,750
by the wolves.

218
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,590
Go rescue him.

219
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,870
Look what you've done.

220
00:10:43,391 --> 00:10:44,584
Enough.

221
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,951
Stop.

222
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,470
Stop.

223
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:51,991
He.

224
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,871
Where are you going?

225
00:10:53,071 --> 00:10:53,911
Go back and get help.

226
00:10:53,911 --> 00:10:54,751
I'll find Wang Ba.

227
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,030
It's too dangerous for you.

228
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,870
He.

229
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,151
It's easier like this. Hurry.

230
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,031
Zheng Xuan.

231
00:10:59,271 --> 00:11:00,311
You brat!

232
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:01,751
I...

233
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:02,751
You...

234
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,630
Don't let go.

235
00:11:58,391 --> 00:11:59,496
Wang Ba, are you okay?

236
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,590
Why are you here?

237
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,152
Forget it. Inform the instructor.

238
00:12:02,152 --> 00:12:04,391
- Go.
- You'll be alone...

239
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,311
Stop nagging.

240
00:12:05,311 --> 00:12:06,431
Hurry up. I have a plan.

241
00:12:09,031 --> 00:12:09,871
Get up there.

242
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,350
Hurry.

243
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:14,191
You're courting death.

244
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,031
Don't...

245
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:58,911
I was once so much like you,

246
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,191
blinded by false perceptions

247
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,391
and ended up a puppet.

248
00:14:04,271 --> 00:14:05,470
Looking back now,

249
00:14:06,551 --> 00:14:07,391
my former self

250
00:14:08,671 --> 00:14:10,551
was just a trapped beast
fighting in vain.

251
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:20,791
What did you say?

252
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,590
He Yan ran away?

253
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:28,751
I never expected

254
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:30,271
that He Yan

255
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,431
had planned to run away.

256
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:34,631
He even urged us to run with him,

257
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:36,151
saying that no one

258
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,280
could reach us
once we crossed the mountain.

259
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:40,071
As a loyal patriot,

260
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,470
I naturally refused.

261
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,310
Mr. Shen.

262
00:14:44,271 --> 00:14:45,111
Mr. Shen.

263
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:47,031
Mai, Jiang Jiao, and Wang Ba are back.

264
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,190
Zheng Xuan.

265
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,190
How dare you lie?

266
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,311
Have you no shame?

267
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:56,168
I didn't...

268
00:15:56,168 --> 00:15:57,064
This petty loser

269
00:15:57,311 --> 00:15:59,031
set free all the horses before leaving.

270
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:00,151
He meant for us to die.

271
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,671
I'm telling the truth.

272
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:02,710
Please do me justice.

273
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,550
Mr. Shen.

274
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,510
None of you dares

275
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,192
to take the risk

276
00:16:09,192 --> 00:16:10,536
and rescue him.

277
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,951
I'll go myself.

278
00:16:13,391 --> 00:16:15,112
I grew up in the mountains.

279
00:16:15,112 --> 00:16:16,951
I'm not afraid of wild beasts.

280
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,551
I'll go alone.

281
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,608
- Commander.
- Commander.

282
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,670
Shen Han.

283
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:35,991
Discipline them.

284
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:37,631
Understood.

285
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,350
Commander, should I search...

286
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,190
No need.

287
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,870
The terrain is treacherous.

288
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,710
It's too risky.

289
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,871
I'll go myself.

290
00:17:39,631 --> 00:17:41,351
This place isn't so bad.

291
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,951
Maidens gaze at autumn's moon,
pleading for dexterity,

292
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,470
threading countless crimson silks
till none remain.

293
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,710
It's the Qixi Festival.

294
00:18:14,831 --> 00:18:16,750
But it's not all bad.

295
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:18,471
After all,

296
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:21,111
I have a dead wolf for company.

297
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:27,511
What?

298
00:18:28,151 --> 00:18:29,631
Are you dreaming of sailing a boat

299
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,151
with your sweetheart

300
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:32,431
to celebrate Qixi?

301
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,550
Commander?

302
00:18:34,631 --> 00:18:35,471
Com...

303
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:39,231
Commander.

304
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,631
How did you find me?

305
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,191
Can you climb up?

306
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,150
Commander.

307
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,630
I can't.

308
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,310
Commander.

309
00:18:54,111 --> 00:18:54,951

You killed a wolf with your bare hands.

326
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:06,671
Not only that,

327
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,431
you helped others retreat

328
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,030
in critical moments.

329
00:21:10,911 --> 00:21:12,191
Among all the recruits,

330
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,824
none has shown such courage as you.

331
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:18,472
Our lives were at stake.

332
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:19,870
Commander.

333
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:21,270
How could you bear to watch

334
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,750
a promising warrior

335
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:24,510
in his prime years

336
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,431
meet the God of Death?

337
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:26,871
Isn't it

338
00:21:27,752 --> 00:21:29,470
what you've taught us, Commander?

339
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,631
So I've been

340
00:21:32,151 --> 00:21:33,710
pushing you to meet the God of Death?

341
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,070
I wouldn't meet him.

342
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,390
He is nowhere

343
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,030
near as handsome as you.

344
00:21:49,111 --> 00:21:49,951
Commander.

345
00:21:50,664 --> 00:21:52,168
Are we heading back now?

346
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,736
Want to spend the night here?

347
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:55,271
No, no.

348
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:56,968
I mean,

349
00:21:57,391 --> 00:21:58,431
there's no one else

350
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,030
and only one horse.

351
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:01,271
So?

352
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,671
So,

353
00:22:06,151 --> 00:22:07,831
are you making me

354
00:22:09,111 --> 00:22:10,591
walk back, Commander?

355
00:22:15,351 --> 00:22:16,431
Oh my.

356
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:21,111
What did I do wrong?

357
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,310
What cruel fate is this?

358
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,070
Get on the horse.

359
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,310
Me?

360
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,710
If you prefer walking back,

361
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,111
I don't mind it.

362
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:36,911
No, no.

363
00:22:36,911 --> 00:22:37,896
I can use a ride.

364
00:22:38,111 --> 00:22:39,016
I'm thrilled.

365
00:22:39,016 --> 00:22:39,991
Doesn't it hurt?

366
00:22:40,591 --> 00:22:41,790
It's just a minor injury.

367
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,870
Wait.

368
00:22:48,671 --> 00:22:49,511
What now?

369
00:22:50,431 --> 00:22:51,271
Commander.

370
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:52,750
Look at that wolf.

371
00:22:53,391 --> 00:22:55,230
I went through great effort to kill it.

372
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,064
Isn't it a shame

373
00:22:57,064 --> 00:22:58,550
to leave it here?

374
00:23:00,111 --> 00:23:00,951
What do you propose?

375
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,510
How about

376
00:23:03,391 --> 00:23:04,951
taking it with us?

377
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,550
Approved.

378
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:08,871
Really?

379
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,951
Commander, you're such a kind soul.

380
00:23:11,151 --> 00:23:11,991
Put it on the horse.

381
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,390
And you get off.

382
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:16,191
Forget it.

383
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,150
Commander.

384
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,111
I just wanted to feel your sword.

385
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:45,871
I didn't get the chance last time.

386
00:23:47,671 --> 00:23:48,511
Nice sword.

387
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,831
What a great sword.

388
00:23:50,351 --> 00:23:51,270
You could be silent.

389
00:23:53,351 --> 00:23:54,191
But Commander,

390
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,456
I'll die of boredom if I don't talk.

391
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:04,191
Commander.

392
00:24:04,391 --> 00:24:06,151
You don't need to be so serious.

393
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,550
Think about it.

394
00:24:07,871 --> 00:24:09,470
I killed a wolf

395
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,310
but didn't take it.

396
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,230
Wouldn't that just benefit the foxes?

397
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,310
Let alone the meat,

398
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,391
even the fur is top quality.

399
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:18,431
It makes excellent cloaks.

400
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:20,151
Of course,

401
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:21,351
you'd consider it beneath you.

402
00:24:21,351 --> 00:24:22,710
Which means I get the advantage.

403
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,671
If I had a wolf-fur cloak,

404
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:26,790
I could

405
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,431
roll around in the snow in winter.

406
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,831
You sound obsessed.

407
00:24:31,431 --> 00:24:33,270
No wonder you clung to that dead wolf

408
00:24:33,671 --> 00:24:34,831
in the pit earlier.

409
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,550
That's not it.

410
00:24:37,191 --> 00:24:38,391
I was just freezing.

411
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,590
I know

412
00:24:40,591 --> 00:24:41,431
you value hygiene

413
00:24:41,631 --> 00:24:42,471
and detest filth.

414
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,151
You'd never let an animal's blood

415
00:24:44,431 --> 00:24:45,550
taint your robes.

416
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,510
But I'm different.

417
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,111
Let alone dead wolves,

418
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,191
I've even lain among corpses.

419
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,550
When?

420
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,351
Well...

421
00:25:06,351 --> 00:25:08,391
That was a long time ago.

422
00:25:11,431 --> 00:25:13,591
My hometown suffered poor harvests

423
00:25:13,911 --> 00:25:14,990
back in the day.

424
00:25:15,351 --> 00:25:16,710
People were starving.

425
00:25:17,111 --> 00:25:18,270
And so many died.

426
00:25:20,104 --> 00:25:21,351
As for the details,

427
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:22,550
I can't recall clearly.

428
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,550
This Qixi Festival

429
00:25:39,431 --> 00:25:41,191
is truly unforgettable.

430
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,630
(A woman?)

431
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,391
(Why did a woman)

432
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,750
(come all the way to Yezhou)

433
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,550
(to join)

434
00:26:20,951 --> 00:26:22,024
(the army?)

435
00:26:36,776 --> 00:26:40,968
(Yezhou Garrison)

436
00:26:40,968 --> 00:26:44,872
(Yezhou Garrison)

437
00:26:52,351 --> 00:26:53,191
Commander.

438
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:54,031
Commander.

439
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,590
He Yan.

440
00:27:00,591 --> 00:27:01,431
He Yan.

441
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,550
Well...

442
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:13,591
Commander, I...

443
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:14,431
Get off now.

444
00:27:15,191 --> 00:27:16,191
Shen Han, get him down.

445
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:18,550
Have Cheng Lisu tend to his wounds.

446
00:27:19,391 --> 00:27:20,231
Understood.

447
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,030
That sharp tongue with a tender heart...

448
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,631
You haven't changed one bit.

449
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,830
What did you say?

450
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:30,031
Nothing.

451
00:27:30,511 --> 00:27:31,351
Nothing.

452
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:32,191
Come on, He Yan.

453
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,310
Come on.

454
00:27:39,151 --> 00:27:40,191
So badly injured?

455
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:45,990
You got this?

456
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,111
- Yeah.
- Take it easy.

457
00:27:47,111 --> 00:27:48,351
Commander, you're back.

458
00:27:49,671 --> 00:27:50,831
How is He Yan doing?

459
00:27:50,831 --> 00:27:51,671
Still breathing.

460
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:53,391
He had killed the wolf

461
00:27:53,951 --> 00:27:54,911
by the time I found him.

462
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,910
He killed a wolf on his own?

463
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,030
We can't underestimate this kid.

464
00:28:00,671 --> 00:28:01,710
Indeed,

465
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,790
we can't.

466
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:06,230
He Yan risked his life

467
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,464
to save the others.

468
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,470
A spy wouldn't have done that.

469
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:11,230
Does this mean

470
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,230
he's off the hook?

471
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:13,991
Not just yet.

472
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:16,231
Commander.

473
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:17,510
What about Zheng Xuan?

474
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,550
Soldiers may fall by enemy blades,

475
00:28:24,151 --> 00:28:26,631
but never to friendly fire.

476
00:28:27,911 --> 00:28:28,751
Zheng Xuan

477
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,070
shall be executed.

478
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,910
Understood.

479
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,590
What?

480
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:40,111
Zheng Xuan was executed?

481
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,871
(Xiao Jue is truly strict
with his troops.)

482
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,070
Put up with it.

483
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,910
Here we go.

484
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,350
What about

485
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:50,951
the others?

486
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,230
Wang Ba crossed the ridge.

487
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,591
Twenty lashes are inevitable.

488
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,990
Jiang Jiao and Mai didn't commit

489
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,056
major offenses,

490
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,350
but Huaijin said

491
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,070
that they must be punished

492
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,910
with ten lashes each

493
00:29:02,191 --> 00:29:03,951
as a warning for abandoning

494
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:04,791
a fellow soldier.

495
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,824
Do you also think

496
00:29:11,151 --> 00:29:11,991
that Huaijin

497
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,448
is a bit too cruel?

498
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,464
I'm not defending him.

499
00:29:15,911 --> 00:29:16,751
But I believe

500
00:29:16,831 --> 00:29:17,671
he actually...

501
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:19,470
The army has inviolable rules.

502
00:29:20,831 --> 00:29:21,671
Zheng Xuan broke

503
00:29:21,871 --> 00:29:22,711
military discipline

504
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,351
and violated brotherhood.

505
00:29:24,871 --> 00:29:26,111
If we ever go to war,

506
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,951
who'd trust him to guard their back?

507
00:29:28,911 --> 00:29:30,550
Yezhou Garrison needs reconstruction.

508
00:29:31,431 --> 00:29:33,230
The Commander aims to make an example

509
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,440
to restore discipline.

510
00:29:35,151 --> 00:29:35,991
Although

511
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:38,750
the execution is brutal,

512
00:29:39,351 --> 00:29:41,390
it's a necessary deterrent.

513
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,830
The Commander

514
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,270
must have decided that

515
00:29:44,391 --> 00:29:45,608
after careful consideration.

516
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,871
For a recruit, you surprisingly

517
00:29:48,111 --> 00:29:49,270
grasp military principles

518
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,831
like a commander does.

519
00:29:51,151 --> 00:29:52,710
I intend to become a general.

520
00:29:52,911 --> 00:29:54,070
Naturally, I know more.

521
00:29:56,911 --> 00:29:57,751
That makes sense.

522
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,910
Take off your shirt.

523
00:30:03,431 --> 00:30:04,271
What?

524
00:30:04,591 --> 00:30:05,790
Why are you so surprised?

525
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,150
As if you're a girl.

526
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,431
If it weren't for our friendship

527
00:30:09,671 --> 00:30:10,831
and Huaijin's request,

528
00:30:11,391 --> 00:30:12,631
as a gynecology expert,

529
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,391
why would I treat a man?

530
00:30:14,911 --> 00:30:15,951
I don't need your help.

531
00:30:16,391 --> 00:30:17,231
I can dress

532
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,351
my wounds.

533
00:30:19,391 --> 00:30:20,831
Why are you suddenly shy?

534
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:22,271
Are you hiding

535
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,688
something unspeakable?

536
00:30:26,312 --> 00:30:27,551
Don't be ashamed.

537
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:29,030
Let me examine you.

538
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,856
Actually, I

539
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,910
have a fiancée.

540
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,568
I'm only intimate with her.

541
00:30:35,311 --> 00:30:36,151
Mr. He.

542
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:37,310
You're so conservative.

543
00:30:38,111 --> 00:30:39,624
But you need medical treatment.

544
00:30:39,624 --> 00:30:41,391
Your fiancée won't mind.

545
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,550
Come on.

546
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,070
I thought you were only intimate

547
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,351
with your fiancée.

548
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:55,591
Mr. He.

549
00:30:55,591 --> 00:30:57,030
Why did you hit me on my face?

550
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,070
You'd ruin my looks.

551
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,232
My apologies.

552
00:31:01,911 --> 00:31:03,230
Let him preserve his virtue

553
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,351
for his fiancée.

554
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,470
Don't expose anything

555
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,351
and let your fiancée down.

556
00:31:18,831 --> 00:31:19,671
Mr. He,

557
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,550
you've earned Huaijin's recognition.

558
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,951
How so?

559
00:31:24,191 --> 00:31:25,671
This healing ointment is precious.

560
00:31:26,111 --> 00:31:27,791
Huaijin hardly uses it himself.

561
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,150
For years,

562
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,632
he's only given it to two people.

563
00:31:30,831 --> 00:31:31,671
One is you.

564
00:31:31,951 --> 00:31:32,791
The other was...

565
00:31:33,671 --> 00:31:34,511
An ungrateful wretch.

566
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,390
Ungrateful wretch?

567
00:31:37,191 --> 00:31:38,031
Never mind.

568
00:31:38,431 --> 00:31:39,271
Don't be like him.

569
00:31:39,871 --> 00:31:40,711
Who is he?

570
00:31:41,311 --> 00:31:42,991
None other than He Rufei.

571
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:44,750
You're talking about me...

572
00:31:45,096 --> 00:31:46,111
He Rufei?

573
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:47,711
That's right.

574
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,911
The current He Rufei

575
00:31:56,391 --> 00:31:57,591
is an ungrateful wretch.

576
00:31:58,191 --> 00:31:59,871
But the former He Rufei

577
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,256
wasn't.

578
00:32:27,671 --> 00:32:28,511
It's him.

579
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:30,151
Could he be...

580
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:34,911
False of heart?

581
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,191
Men's thoughts are inscrutable.

582
00:32:39,431 --> 00:32:40,671
I still don't know him

583
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:42,231
well enough.

584
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,870
(What exactly did Xiao Jue go through)

585
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:51,871
(to employ
such brutal military discipline?)

586
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,830
Master.

587
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,070
I came today

588
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,831
to light a perpetual lamp

589
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,470
for my stepsister He Yan.

590
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,911
Amitabha.

591
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:30,671
But this lamp

592
00:33:31,111 --> 00:33:32,191
is rather different

593
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:33,871
from the others.

594
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:37,550
What kind of lamp do you want, General?

595
00:33:39,591 --> 00:33:40,631
(This lamp)

596
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,671
(must suppress her spirit.)

597
00:33:47,671 --> 00:33:49,431
They say Xiao Huaijin

598
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:53,310
is thriving in Yezhou.

599
00:33:53,911 --> 00:33:55,591
The recruits he trained

600
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,030
are showing great promise.

601
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,310
Yezhou Garrison's supplies

602
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,431
are controlled
by the Yezhou County Office.

603
00:34:04,391 --> 00:34:05,871
If I recall correctly,

604
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:08,070
Yezhou Magistrate Sun Xiangfu

605
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,951
is also your disciple.

606
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,311
Though he works for me,

607
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,670
distance breeds

608
00:34:18,751 --> 00:34:20,951
delusions of local kingship.

609
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:25,630
He's developed improper ambitions.

610
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,231
Do you have concerns?

611
00:34:28,951 --> 00:34:30,711
I once helped him,

612
00:34:30,911 --> 00:34:32,590
and he repaid favors,

613
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,568
leading to

614
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:36,791
financial exchanges.

615
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:39,190
But being petty-minded,

616
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:42,231
he likely kept secret records.

617
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:45,111
Chancellor, Mr. Chu.

618
00:34:45,231 --> 00:34:46,231
General Feihong is here.

619
00:34:46,831 --> 00:34:47,671
He Rufei?

620
00:34:48,328 --> 00:34:50,440
He's always stayed neutral,

621
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,350
away from trouble.

622
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:53,256
But he suddenly visits today...

623
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,510
Zilan.

624
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,391
I am rather weary today.

625
00:34:59,711 --> 00:35:01,070
Entertain our guest.

626
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:02,191
Understood.

627
00:35:11,911 --> 00:35:12,871
General Feihong.

628
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,830
I truly admire you.

629
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,990
It's such an honor

630
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,830
for me

631
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,470
to witness your noble bearing.

632
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,311
You flatter me, Mr. Chu.

633
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:22,711
I'm just lucky

634
00:35:22,711 --> 00:35:24,671
to have cured the scars on my face

635
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:26,184
and stopped wearing the mask.

636
00:35:26,184 --> 00:35:27,550
General, please.

637
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:33,271
Mr. Chu.

638
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,351
Where is the Chancellor?

639
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,510
Occupied with official matters,

640
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,271
he asked me to host you on his behalf.

641
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,224
I hope you won't

642
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:42,271
take offense.

643
00:35:43,831 --> 00:35:46,751
The Chancellor handles myriad affairs.
Of course, he is busy.

644
00:35:46,751 --> 00:35:49,311
But you seem quite at leisure, Mr. Chu.

645
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:52,168
You're serving tea
in the Chancellor's mansion

646
00:35:52,168 --> 00:35:54,056
and learning to be a host.

647
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:56,030
The art of tea

648
00:35:56,391 --> 00:35:58,311
nurtures the spirit

649
00:35:58,831 --> 00:36:00,990
and honors guests.

650
00:36:01,431 --> 00:36:03,190
Didn't you come

651
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,160
to visit the Chancellor

652
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,951
for this very cup of tea?

653
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:12,510
As sharp-tongued as you are,

654
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:13,591
I suppose

655
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,271
you also make excellent tea.

656
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,911
That's why the Chancellor values you so.

657
00:36:21,351 --> 00:36:22,191
Ding Yi.

658
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,768
I recently acquired
a rare hydraulics manuscript

659
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:27,150
and brought it to Mr. Xu.

660
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,670
(Hydraulics book)
Since he is occupied,

661
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:31,816
may I trouble you to deliver it to him?

662
00:36:32,751 --> 00:36:33,751
My pleasure.

663
00:36:36,351 --> 00:36:37,191
Farewell.

664
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,590
(He Rufei's guard)

665
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,510
(seems remarkably skilled.)

666
00:36:53,831 --> 00:36:54,671
Zilan.

667
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,550
Sit.

668
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,390
Understood.

669
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:03,190
What do you think

670
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,711
of He Rufei?

671
00:37:05,711 --> 00:37:07,311
I'm not sure if he's being fake

672
00:37:07,311 --> 00:37:08,584
or just overrated,

673
00:37:08,831 --> 00:37:09,751
but he's not exactly

674
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,311
how people described him.

675
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:17,751
You strike true to the core.

676
00:37:18,351 --> 00:37:19,191
However,

677
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,448
he does possess merits.

678
00:37:23,311 --> 00:37:24,231
Aren't you

679
00:37:24,231 --> 00:37:25,831
concerned about Yezhou Garrison?

680
00:37:26,391 --> 00:37:27,231
I think

681
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,744
his arrival proves timely.

682
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:30,151
He has

683
00:37:30,231 --> 00:37:31,311
an exceptional guard.

684
00:37:32,271 --> 00:37:33,550
If we get them to join us,

685
00:37:34,231 --> 00:37:35,311
we can take down Xiao Jue

686
00:37:35,911 --> 00:37:37,110
and get rid of

687
00:37:37,271 --> 00:37:38,231
the Sun family.

688
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:40,631
Very well.

689
00:37:41,351 --> 00:37:43,911
Since you've devised a plan,

690
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,320
I'll entrust

691
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,030
this matter to you.

692
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,030
Understood.

693
00:37:49,206 --> 00:37:51,336
(Hydraulics book)

694
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:54,824
(Chu Mansion)

695
00:38:02,751 --> 00:38:03,591
Father.

696
00:38:04,406 --> 00:38:06,312
(Lord Shijin, Chu Linfeng)

697
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,391
How is the Chancellor?

698
00:38:09,951 --> 00:38:12,072
Why didn't he ask you
to stay for dinner?

699
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,510
He is well,

700
00:38:14,351 --> 00:38:15,464
just busy with work.

701
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:16,631
I dare not

702
00:38:16,751 --> 00:38:17,591
disrupt him.

703
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,190
Oh, you...

704
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,510
How many times have I told you?

705
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,070
Stay by the Chancellor's side.

706
00:38:24,391 --> 00:38:25,470
Strengthen your bond.

707
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:26,630
That's how

708
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,110
he'll value you in the future.

709
00:38:29,831 --> 00:38:30,671
Forget it.

710
00:38:31,911 --> 00:38:33,470
I must attend a banquet.

711
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,310
Dine with your mother

712
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:36,271
in the inner chambers.

713
00:38:36,271 --> 00:38:37,111
Understood.

714
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,280
(Sunlight bears auspiciousness)
Greetings, Mother.

715
00:38:50,751 --> 00:38:52,630
Father sent me to dine with you.

716
00:38:54,311 --> 00:38:56,150
(Wife of Lord Shijin)
I have no appetite.

717
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,510
I'll retire early.

718
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,990
Dine alone.

719
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:01,990
Understood.

720
00:39:03,831 --> 00:39:05,431
Stop acting like you are

721
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,271
Lingfeng's biological son.

722
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,391
Your mother

723
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,110
might have been Miss Chu,

724
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,590
but nobody knows

725
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:14,871
who your father is.

726
00:39:15,391 --> 00:39:17,351
Your uncle adopted you, who was born

727
00:39:17,351 --> 00:39:18,630
to an unknown father

728
00:39:18,751 --> 00:39:19,951
for the family's reputation.

729
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,190
Don't you want

730
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,150
your shameless mother,

731
00:39:23,431 --> 00:39:24,872
who bore a child out of wedlock,

732
00:39:24,872 --> 00:39:26,030
to enter the ancestral hall?

733
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,190
Then you'd better
work harder to elevate your status.

734
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,310
Draw.

735
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:46,232
Turn.

736
00:39:47,911 --> 00:39:48,751
Uppercut.

737
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,310
Thrust.

738
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:51,870
Stab.

739
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,390
Commander.

740
00:39:57,751 --> 00:39:58,711
You dug so much

741
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:00,470
into his past,

742
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,311
but to no avail?

743
00:40:01,791 --> 00:40:02,631
That's right.

744
00:40:02,951 --> 00:40:05,071
Everything matches his military records.

745
00:40:05,871 --> 00:40:06,711
Perhaps He Yan

746
00:40:06,711 --> 00:40:07,590
has nothing to do

747
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,776
with He Rufei and Xu Jingfu.

748
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,350
This only proves

749
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,711
those covering for him
are remarkably capable.

750
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:15,912
Covering for him?

751
00:40:16,711 --> 00:40:17,791
Did you discover something?

752
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,510
An unexpected lead.

753
00:40:22,431 --> 00:40:23,351
Keep looking.

754
00:40:24,231 --> 00:40:25,071
