(The Commander is too upright)

28
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,064
(to visit such a place.)

(It's my chance to shake him off.)

00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,714
(Wanhua Pavilion)

31
00:04:04,784 --> 00:04:05,465
Mr. Zhang.

32
00:04:05,865 --> 00:04:06,745
We've been waiting.

33
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:09,704
Come on.

34
00:04:10,104 --> 00:04:10,745
Hurry up.

35
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:12,305
Upstairs, please.

36
00:04:12,305 --> 00:04:12,944
Alright.

37
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:17,784
Mr. Wang.

38
00:04:17,784 --> 00:04:18,905
I've missed you so much.

39
00:04:19,145 --> 00:04:20,664
The girls are ready.

40
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:22,664
Have a great time.

41
00:04:22,905 --> 00:04:23,705
Alright.

42
00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:26,905
Serve our young master well.

43
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:28,025
Alright.

44
00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:29,705
Do come again.

45
00:04:29,864 --> 00:04:31,864
Let me keep you company.

46
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:33,585
I haven't seen you in ages.

47
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:37,465
Have fun. Drink plenty.

48
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,145
Alright.

49
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:44,264
Young master, long time no see.

50
00:04:44,544 --> 00:04:45,416
Yunyan.

51
00:04:46,465 --> 00:04:48,040
Entertain the young master.

52
00:04:48,145 --> 00:04:48,784
No problem.

53
00:04:49,344 --> 00:04:50,304
You look new here.

54
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:51,528
Is this your first visit?

55
00:04:52,104 --> 00:04:52,680
Yeah.

56
00:04:52,784 --> 00:04:53,640
New experience.

57
00:04:53,784 --> 00:04:54,664
Please show me around.

58
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:56,465
We have the best girls here.

59
00:04:56,825 --> 00:04:57,864
Check out the new ones.

60
00:04:58,065 --> 00:04:58,625
Miss.

61
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:00,664
Shall we go upstairs?

62
00:05:01,224 --> 00:05:03,176
What's the rush, young master?

63
00:05:04,145 --> 00:05:05,184
The night is short.

64
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:06,784
Let's not waste it.

65
00:05:06,984 --> 00:05:07,705
Alright.

66
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:09,705
Young master.

67
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:10,784
Isn't that

68
00:05:10,905 --> 00:05:12,065
the fortune teller we met

69
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:13,065
returning from Que City?

70
00:05:13,544 --> 00:05:14,625
Why is he here?

71
00:05:14,945 --> 00:05:15,585
Here.

72
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:16,664
See?

73
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,145
Isn't she nice?

74
00:05:27,344 --> 00:05:28,104
Bro,

75
00:05:29,265 --> 00:05:30,465
fate led us to meet.

76
00:05:30,984 --> 00:05:32,664
I know some fortune-telling.

77
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:34,304
Would you like

78
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:35,880
to get a divination?

79
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:53,128
Bro.

80
00:05:53,544 --> 00:05:54,945
Have you recently

81
00:05:55,304 --> 00:05:56,505
suffered bloodshed?

82
00:05:59,304 --> 00:06:00,585
Looks like I'm right.

83
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:02,120
Just a minor injury.

84
00:06:02,224 --> 00:06:02,784
No big deal.

85
00:06:04,265 --> 00:06:05,032
Bro.

86
00:06:05,104 --> 00:06:06,224
That's not right.

87
00:06:06,544 --> 00:06:07,825
Minor injury matters too.

88
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:09,304
It may cause serious trouble

89
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:11,065
if left untreated.

90
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:12,625
For example,

91
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,344
it may hinder your moves in battles.

92
00:06:14,344 --> 00:06:15,025
That

93
00:06:15,304 --> 00:06:17,352
could be fatal.

94
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:18,984
But don't worry

95
00:06:18,984 --> 00:06:19,864
too much, bro.

96
00:06:20,065 --> 00:06:21,184
Consider yourself lucky.

97
00:06:21,184 --> 00:06:21,864
You met me today.

98
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,104
I have some medicine here.

99
00:06:28,265 --> 00:06:28,905
This elixir

100
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:30,472
stops the pain and bleeding.

101
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:32,552
Take this

102
00:06:32,664 --> 00:06:33,744
to strengthen vitality.

103
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:42,344
Thank you, my friend.

104
00:06:42,856 --> 00:06:43,505
No problem.

105
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:45,145
Yingxiang.

106
00:06:54,145 --> 00:06:54,952
Farewell.

107
00:06:56,664 --> 00:06:57,145
Sir.

108
00:06:57,385 --> 00:06:57,905
Coming.

109
00:06:58,104 --> 00:06:58,705
Check please.

110
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,625
Five coins in total.

111
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:02,385
Okay, thanks.

112
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:03,912
Young master.

113
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,224
Does he really know divination?

114
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,344
I highly doubt it.

115
00:07:09,224 --> 00:07:10,224
He sniffed it out.

116
00:07:10,824 --> 00:07:11,528
Let's go.

117
00:07:18,864 --> 00:07:19,688
He might be

118
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:21,984
telling fortunes here.

119
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:26,984
Isn't it nice here?

120
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:27,705
Look around.

121
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:28,680
And

122
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:29,544
look at them.

123
00:07:29,905 --> 00:07:31,848
They're new girls.

124
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:32,385
Come on.

125
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,505
Let me show you my room.

126
00:07:42,585 --> 00:07:43,304
Miss.

127
00:07:43,544 --> 00:07:44,664
What's that room for?

128
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:46,224
That room?

129
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:47,784
That's where dancers practice.

130
00:07:48,104 --> 00:07:49,505
Then they perform

131
00:07:49,505 --> 00:07:50,664
at noble banquets.

132
00:07:51,344 --> 00:07:52,328
Young master.

133
00:07:52,328 --> 00:07:53,800
The night is too short.

134
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,025
Hurry.

135
00:07:57,705 --> 00:07:58,385
Come on.

136
00:07:58,664 --> 00:07:59,304
Hurry.

137
00:07:59,544 --> 00:08:00,385
Wait here.

138
00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:01,344
I'll fetch wine.

139
00:08:02,905 --> 00:08:03,984
Just a moment.

140
00:08:10,585 --> 00:08:11,505
(Dancers?)

141
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:12,825
(Perform?)

142
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:49,584
Hurry.

143
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:56,505
(Good thing I wore this veil.)

144
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:58,064
(He doesn't recognize me.)

145
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:01,464
Why hasn't it started yet?

146
00:09:01,704 --> 00:09:03,025
I've waited forever.

147
00:09:03,145 --> 00:09:03,905
When will it start?

148
00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:05,784
I came just to see Miss Sun.

149
00:09:05,865 --> 00:09:06,584
Start already.

150
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,584
Will you start?

151
00:09:08,345 --> 00:09:09,424
Take care, Mr. Zhang.

152
00:09:10,225 --> 00:09:11,345
What should I do?

153
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:18,584
Miss Sun isn't feeling well.

154
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:20,625
She hasn't changed yet.

155
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:22,745
Go on the stage

156
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:24,704
and buy us some time.

157
00:09:24,704 --> 00:09:26,024
Hurry.

158
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:29,865
Nice figure.

159
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:31,745
Are you going to sing?

160
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:33,905
What are you waiting for?

161
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:34,704
Dance.

162
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:35,424
Just dance.

163
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:39,745
Just a second.

164
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,265
Dance.

165
00:09:40,265 --> 00:09:41,105
Just a second.

166
00:09:42,544 --> 00:09:43,985
Come on, we're waiting.

167
00:09:44,704 --> 00:09:45,800
Start dancing.

168
00:09:46,225 --> 00:09:47,385
The carriage is ready.

169
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:49,145
Let's go.

170
00:09:51,144 --> 00:09:51,688
(Never mind.)

171
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:53,625
(Let me get through this first)

172
00:09:54,184 --> 00:09:55,265
(to avoid being caught.)

173
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:57,105
(Since Ding Yi)

174
00:09:57,505 --> 00:09:59,424
(is disguised as Sun Xiangfu's servant,)

175
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:01,304
(I'll see what to do)

176
00:10:01,505 --> 00:10:02,505
(in the Sun Mansion.)

177
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:06,312
Young master.

178
00:10:06,664 --> 00:10:07,816
May I borrow your sword?

179
00:10:25,544 --> 00:10:26,505
Bravo.

180
00:10:28,985 --> 00:10:29,505
Nice!

181
00:10:29,512 --> 00:10:30,152
Nice!

182
00:10:30,704 --> 00:10:31,345
Nice!

183
00:10:31,745 --> 00:10:32,385
Nice!

184
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:33,304
Sword dance.

185
00:10:33,944 --> 00:10:35,064
Alright!

186
00:10:43,824 --> 00:10:44,664
Isn't that nice?

187
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:47,184
Bravo!

188
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,304
Bravo.

189
00:11:16,704 --> 00:11:18,304
A woman disguised as a man.

190
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:20,704
Interesting.

191
00:11:20,905 --> 00:11:21,544
Nice!

192
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,385
Nice!

193
00:11:35,584 --> 00:11:36,184
(Commander?)

194
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:37,985
(He actually came in.)

195
00:11:42,544 --> 00:11:43,145
Step down.

196
00:11:45,345 --> 00:11:46,304
Off the stage.

197
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:09,184
(Oh no.)

198
00:12:09,385 --> 00:12:10,225
(I lost the rhythm.)

199
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:52,184
Bravo!

200
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:53,105
Bravo!

201
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:13,184
Nice!

202
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:51,184
Nice!

203
00:13:51,505 --> 00:13:52,625
Nice!

204
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:01,625
Thank you for the flower.

205
00:14:03,064 --> 00:14:03,824
A flower

206
00:14:04,424 --> 00:14:05,584
for a beauty.

207
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:13,064
(It's him.)

208
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:43,064
Bravo.

209
00:14:55,745 --> 00:14:56,584
(This woman)

210
00:14:57,345 --> 00:14:58,784
(has sheer audacity.)

211
00:15:01,105 --> 00:15:01,745
How was that?

212
00:15:02,745 --> 00:15:03,464
Wasn't it great?

213
00:15:03,544 --> 00:15:04,296
(That was close.)

214
00:15:05,025 --> 00:15:05,664
(I knew)

215
00:15:06,424 --> 00:15:07,464
(Xiao Jue wouldn't)

216
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,385
(recognize me in this attire.)

217
00:15:10,184 --> 00:15:10,625
Mr. Chu.

218
00:15:11,265 --> 00:15:12,064
Long time no see.

219
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,745
Masterful flute work.

220
00:15:15,544 --> 00:15:16,784
Thank you for your praise.

221
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:18,856
But

222
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,064
I didn't expect to see you here.

223
00:15:22,025 --> 00:15:22,784
What a small world.

224
00:15:24,544 --> 00:15:25,064
This way.

225
00:15:29,544 --> 00:15:30,664
What are you doing?

226
00:15:31,385 --> 00:15:31,944
Let me go.

227
00:15:31,944 --> 00:15:33,145
Hurry. Bring her back.

228
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:34,145
Hurry.

229
00:15:34,385 --> 00:15:35,304
Bring her back.

230
00:15:35,544 --> 00:15:36,064
Let me go.

231
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:37,704
Catch her! Hurry.

232
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:38,505
Bring her back.

233
00:15:38,784 --> 00:15:39,944
Don't let her get away.

234
00:15:40,225 --> 00:15:40,985
Grab her.

235
00:15:41,345 --> 00:15:41,865
Hurry.

236
00:15:42,225 --> 00:15:43,184
Get her back.

237
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:44,145
Don't let her get away.

238
00:15:44,345 --> 00:15:45,225
Tie her up.

239
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:46,584
Tie her up.

240
00:15:46,584 --> 00:15:47,544
Somebody help.

241
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:50,025
Young Master Sun's men

242
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:50,944
will be here shortly.

243
00:15:51,345 --> 00:15:52,145
Do her makeup.

244
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:52,905
Hurry up.

245
00:15:59,385 --> 00:16:00,505
Drink some more.

246
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:02,265
It's been a year

247
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:04,105
since we parted in Yaojing.

248
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:06,464
Now we met in Yezhou.

249
00:16:07,385 --> 00:16:09,184
The court knows
that Yezhou Garrison faces

250
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:10,064
supply shortages.

251
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:10,865
I came

252
00:16:11,145 --> 00:16:12,865
by decree to resolve this matter.

253
00:16:13,544 --> 00:16:15,145
So the inspector they sent

254
00:16:15,704 --> 00:16:16,385
is you.

255
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:17,985
Thank you for your hard work.

256
00:16:19,064 --> 00:16:19,985
We should thank you

257
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:20,745
for training

258
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,265
the recruits in Yezhou.

259
00:16:22,865 --> 00:16:23,625
I'm just holding

260
00:16:23,865 --> 00:16:24,985
a nominal position.

261
00:16:25,865 --> 00:16:26,625
Besides,

262
00:16:26,865 --> 00:16:28,184
I don't know anyone in Yezhou

263
00:16:28,584 --> 00:16:29,865
to do my job as the inspector.

264
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:31,345
I hardly deserve

265
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,745
any praise.

266
00:16:44,025 --> 00:16:44,584
Oh, right.

267
00:16:45,424 --> 00:16:47,464
Have you met Magistrate Sun yet?

268
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,704
My nephew insisted

269
00:16:50,304 --> 00:16:51,505
on touring Yezhou.

270
00:16:52,064 --> 00:16:53,664
So I came a few days earlier.

271
00:16:54,584 --> 00:16:55,544
Could you please

272
00:16:55,865 --> 00:16:56,584
keep it a secret?

273
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:57,800
What a coincidence.

274
00:16:58,145 --> 00:16:58,745
I also came

275
00:16:58,784 --> 00:16:59,865
a few days earlier

276
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:02,265
to learn a few things about Yezhou.

277
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:05,905
No business talks

278
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:07,385
since we're here for fun.

279
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:09,464
I've long heard of the snowscapes

280
00:17:09,704 --> 00:17:11,184
of Yezhou Garrison.

281
00:17:12,024 --> 00:17:13,464
Extend your stay and you'll surely

282
00:17:14,065 --> 00:17:15,145
get to see it.

283
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:18,984
Do visit again.

284
00:17:19,424 --> 00:17:20,184
Upstairs, please.

285
00:17:21,785 --> 00:17:23,105
Leaving so soon, Mr. Wang.

286
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:39,385
Young master,

287
00:17:39,865 --> 00:17:40,704
don't you like

288
00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:41,545
any of the girls?

289
00:17:42,065 --> 00:17:42,984
You're leaving so soon.

290
00:17:43,585 --> 00:17:44,385
Young master.

291
00:17:46,744 --> 00:17:47,865
(He Yan crosses paths)

292
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:48,865
(with Chu Zhao.)

293
00:17:49,424 --> 00:17:50,944
(And he's so focused on He Yan.)

294
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,264
(Could it be)

295
00:17:52,744 --> 00:17:53,944
(that they know each other?)

296
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,385
It's getting late.

297
00:17:56,984 --> 00:17:57,825
I have to go.

298
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,224
Presumably,

299
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,424
our next meeting

300
00:18:00,944 --> 00:18:02,145
will be at the Sun Mansion.

301
00:18:07,865 --> 00:18:08,625
Take care.

302
00:19:09,544 --> 00:19:10,105
Let's go.

303
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:29,184
Sorry, I'm starving.

304
00:19:29,664 --> 00:19:30,944
This isn't my usual manner.

305
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:33,576
It's fine. Just eat.

306
00:19:33,865 --> 00:19:34,545
Talk over food.

307
00:19:36,145 --> 00:19:37,160
Where were we?

308
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:38,888
Wedding escape.

309
00:19:39,664 --> 00:19:40,664
Yeah, wedding escape.

310
00:19:41,184 --> 00:19:42,145
My name is Song Taotao.

311
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,184
I ran away from home.

312
00:19:43,504 --> 00:19:44,984
I was passing through Yezhou

313
00:19:45,224 --> 00:19:46,424
when I got abducted.

314
00:19:47,224 --> 00:19:48,585
Thankfully, you saved me.

315
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,024
(Song Taotao?)

316
00:19:52,944 --> 00:19:53,984
He Yan is studying

317
00:19:54,264 --> 00:19:56,024
at Xianchang Academy now.

318
00:19:56,984 --> 00:19:58,744
Nobody has discovered the truth.

319
00:19:59,024 --> 00:19:59,785
Good to know.

320
00:20:00,744 --> 00:20:02,345
He Yan is 15 now.

321
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:05,305
We must arrange for his marriage

322
00:20:05,944 --> 00:20:07,785
before he reaches 18.

323
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:09,384
(Marriage?)

324
00:20:10,065 --> 00:20:11,385
(I'm not a man.)

325
00:20:11,704 --> 00:20:12,625
(How do I get married?)

326
00:20:13,424 --> 00:20:14,264
(Once I'm engaged,)

327
00:20:14,704 --> 00:20:16,105
(who will be "He Rufei"?)

328
00:20:16,704 --> 00:20:18,585
The daughter
of the Chief Imperial Physician,

329
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:19,424
Song Taotao.

330
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:21,944
She seems like a perfect match

331
00:20:22,024 --> 00:20:23,065
for He Yan.

332
00:20:23,424 --> 00:20:25,264
We can form a marital alliance.

333
00:20:27,105 --> 00:20:27,704
(I will never)

334
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:29,024
(get engaged to Miss Song.)

335
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:30,305
(Not only that,)

336
00:20:30,865 --> 00:20:31,585
(I will never)

337
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:32,585
(marry any woman,)

338
00:20:32,984 --> 00:20:34,385
(so as not to ruin her life.)

339
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:41,024
(Isn't she the one who almost)

340
00:20:41,024 --> 00:20:42,504
(became my fiancée?)

341
00:20:43,345 --> 00:20:44,545
(Fate truly connects us.)

342
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:53,464
Why are you looking at me like that?

343
00:20:54,464 --> 00:20:55,264
It's nothing.

344
00:20:55,585 --> 00:20:57,545
So, who abducted you?

345
00:20:59,504 --> 00:21:00,264
I don't know.

346
00:21:00,664 --> 00:21:02,305
I ran into him the moment I arrived.

347
00:21:03,184 --> 00:21:04,905
His lackeys called him

348
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,440
Young Master Sun.

349
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:07,825
He called me pretty,

350
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,424
asked me to be his mistress,

351
00:21:09,504 --> 00:21:10,464
and tried to assault me.

352
00:21:10,865 --> 00:21:11,944
So I stabbed his arm

353
00:21:12,184 --> 00:21:13,385
with my hairpin.

354
00:21:16,065 --> 00:21:17,024
You may look frail,

355
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,704
but you have a fiery temper.

356
00:21:19,305 --> 00:21:20,184
But I didn't expect

357
00:21:20,264 --> 00:21:21,065
that I couldn't

358
00:21:21,224 --> 00:21:21,905
get rid of them.

359
00:21:22,345 --> 00:21:23,305
I could have run away

360
00:21:23,424 --> 00:21:24,625
if I had been careful.

361
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:26,744
It sounds like you know

362
00:21:26,905 --> 00:21:28,424
how to defend yourself.

363
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,504
What are those?

364
00:21:34,704 --> 00:21:36,168
This is datura

365
00:21:36,464 --> 00:21:38,065
for sedation and anesthesia.

366
00:21:40,905 --> 00:21:42,120
This is arisaema

367
00:21:42,224 --> 00:21:43,944
for calming convulsions.

368
00:21:47,825 --> 00:21:49,345
This withered flower

369
00:21:49,345 --> 00:21:50,305
is rhododendron molle

370
00:21:50,504 --> 00:21:52,024
for blood circulation and pain relief.

371
00:21:54,704 --> 00:21:55,905
These sliced pieces

372
00:21:55,944 --> 00:21:56,625
are aconite.

373
00:21:56,905 --> 00:21:58,785
- They dispel cold and relieve pain.
- Wait.

374
00:21:59,744 --> 00:22:00,616
All these herbs

375
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:02,145
are poisonous, right?

376
00:22:02,704 --> 00:22:03,264
Yeah.

377
00:22:03,585 --> 00:22:04,224
Maybe

378
00:22:04,345 --> 00:22:05,625
they'll come in handy later.

379
00:22:07,184 --> 00:22:08,504
Not really. Put them away.

380
00:22:15,105 --> 00:22:15,785
Anyway,

381
00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:17,024
this "Young Master Sun"

382
00:22:18,224 --> 00:22:20,024
could be the son of Yezhou Magistrate

383
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:21,464
Sun Xiangfu.

384
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:23,744
That complicates things.

385
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,024
Sir,

386
00:22:30,264 --> 00:22:31,145
I'm Song Taotao.

387
00:22:31,545 --> 00:22:32,385
I'll repay

388
00:22:32,545 --> 00:22:33,305
your kindness

389
00:22:33,305 --> 00:22:34,408
when I return to Yaojing.

390
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:35,345
Hero,

391
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:36,464
what's your name?

392
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:38,184
I'm flattered.

393
00:22:38,545 --> 00:22:39,305
My name...

394
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:42,944
My name is Cheng...

395
00:22:51,224 --> 00:22:51,785
Hurry.

396
00:22:56,744 --> 00:22:58,264
They just won't leave us alone.

397
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:06,568
I underestimated them.

398
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:07,785
You're from the capital

399
00:23:07,785 --> 00:23:08,865
and don't sound local.

400
00:23:09,105 --> 00:23:09,984
They must have guessed

401
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:11,224
we'd come to an inn.

402
00:23:12,385 --> 00:23:12,944
Forget it.

403
00:23:13,504 --> 00:23:14,865
We're on their turf, after all.

404
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:15,625
Stay here.

405
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:16,545
I'll handle it.

406
00:23:18,305 --> 00:23:19,264
In that case,

407
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:21,065
it's kind of my turf, too.

408
00:23:21,785 --> 00:23:22,625
I'm quite capable.

409
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:25,944
You're not local, either.

410
00:23:26,264 --> 00:23:27,145
Helping me may get you

411
00:23:27,184 --> 00:23:28,385
into serious trouble.

412
00:23:28,545 --> 00:23:29,825
Others didn't dare help me.

413
00:23:30,145 --> 00:23:31,345
Why are you helping me?

414
00:23:35,184 --> 00:23:35,785
Because

415
00:23:36,464 --> 00:23:37,385
you're a woman.

416
00:23:39,664 --> 00:23:40,984
(And so am I.)

417
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:50,105
Hurry up.

418
00:23:50,385 --> 00:23:50,984
Move.

419
00:23:51,345 --> 00:23:51,905
Hurry up.

420
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:52,785
Go.

421
00:23:53,105 --> 00:23:53,744
And you.

422
00:23:54,152 --> 00:23:54,744
Move.

423
00:23:54,744 --> 00:23:55,305
Hurry.

424
00:23:55,305 --> 00:23:55,865
Out.

425
00:23:57,704 --> 00:23:58,224
Move.

426
00:23:58,424 --> 00:23:59,024
Go.

427
00:23:59,224 --> 00:23:59,825
(Sun Ling, son of Sun Xiangfu)
Out.

428
00:24:00,024 --> 00:24:00,625
Stop dawdling.

429
00:24:00,865 --> 00:24:01,385
Faster.

430
00:24:01,424 --> 00:24:02,224
Get going.

431
00:24:02,385 --> 00:24:02,952
Go.

432
00:24:03,664 --> 00:24:04,184
Hurry up.

433
00:24:05,385 --> 00:24:06,224
Why is that door

434
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:07,145
closed?

435
00:24:08,145 --> 00:24:08,944
Let's check it.

436
00:24:10,264 --> 00:24:10,944
Let's go.

437
00:24:11,105 --> 00:24:11,704
Let's go.

438
00:24:17,504 --> 00:24:18,088
Open the door.

439
00:24:18,345 --> 00:24:18,865
Open up.

440
00:24:19,345 --> 00:24:20,264
Coming.

441
00:24:20,785 --> 00:24:22,065
Hurry up.

442
00:24:23,424 --> 00:24:24,944
It's so late. What's going on?

443
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:26,704
Step aside.

444
00:24:29,865 --> 00:24:31,224
Search thoroughly.

445
00:24:33,464 --> 00:24:34,184
Young master.

446
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:34,984
Put this on.

447
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:35,825
It's chilly.

448
00:24:36,865 --> 00:24:37,825
Search carefully.

449
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:50,504
Mr. Sun.

450
00:24:50,785 --> 00:24:51,385
She's not here.

451
00:24:54,105 --> 00:24:54,625
It's so late.

452
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:55,625
Who said you could

453
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:56,808
just barge into my room?

454
00:24:57,744 --> 00:24:58,704
This is ridiculous.

455
00:24:59,224 --> 00:25:00,385
Do I need permission

456
00:25:00,385 --> 00:25:01,128
to go anywhere

457
00:25:01,128 --> 00:25:02,345
in Yezhou?

458
00:25:04,184 --> 00:25:05,585
Keep your eyes sharp.

459
00:25:06,744 --> 00:25:07,905
Inspect them.

460
00:25:08,545 --> 00:25:09,264
Understood.

461
00:25:21,704 --> 00:25:22,408
Looking similar.

462
00:25:25,184 --> 00:25:26,545
What's your name?

463
00:25:27,305 --> 00:25:28,464
Cheng Lisu.

464
00:25:33,545 --> 00:25:34,585
Raise your head.

465
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:39,464
Hey, you.

466
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,785
Raise your head.

467
00:25:40,865 --> 00:25:41,625
Sir.

468
00:25:41,905 --> 00:25:43,184
Don't cross the line.

469
00:25:46,264 --> 00:25:47,016
So it turns out

470
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:48,625
that the assassin who abducted

471
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:49,504
my concubine

472
00:25:50,105 --> 00:25:51,145
is you.

473
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:53,256
Guards.

474
00:25:53,704 --> 00:25:54,865
Arrest

475
00:25:55,385 --> 00:25:56,264
both of them.

476
00:25:56,464 --> 00:25:57,065
Understood.

477
00:25:59,585 --> 00:26:00,264
It's fine.

478
00:26:01,504 --> 00:26:02,088
Move.

479
00:26:10,305 --> 00:26:11,080
Mr. Sun.

480
00:26:11,704 --> 00:26:12,385
I suggest you

481
00:26:12,944 --> 00:26:15,145
think twice before arresting me.

482
00:26:15,264 --> 00:26:16,040
Do you know

483
00:26:16,145 --> 00:26:16,944
who my uncle is?

484
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:18,464
- Who's your uncle?
- Who's your uncle?

485
00:26:20,385 --> 00:26:21,352
My uncle

486
00:26:21,545 --> 00:26:23,744
is appointed by His Majesty

487
00:26:23,744 --> 00:26:24,785
as General Fengyun

488
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:26,856
and Right Army Commander.

489
00:26:26,984 --> 00:26:27,785
Xiao Jue.

490
00:26:28,825 --> 00:26:29,464
How about that?

491
00:26:29,585 --> 00:26:30,585
Still arresting me?

492
00:26:36,585 --> 00:26:37,825
Did you hear that?

493
00:26:38,504 --> 00:26:39,704
Who's his uncle again?

494
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:44,145
You brat.

495
00:26:45,065 --> 00:26:46,345
If Xiao Jue is your uncle,

496
00:26:46,376 --> 00:26:47,504
get him here.

497
00:26:47,984 --> 00:26:49,024
He's your uncle. So what?

498
00:26:49,184 --> 00:26:49,865
So ridiculous.

499
00:26:50,145 --> 00:26:51,825
Today I'll make you beg

500
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:53,264
for death

501
00:26:53,744 --> 00:26:55,145
in front of him.

502
00:26:58,305 --> 00:26:58,825
Really?

503
00:27:03,504 --> 00:27:04,424
Try your luck.

504
00:27:09,424 --> 00:27:09,944
See?

505
00:27:10,145 --> 00:27:11,224
That's my uncle.

506
00:27:12,105 --> 00:27:12,744
Let go.

507
00:27:13,944 --> 00:27:14,856
Huaijin.

508
00:27:16,224 --> 00:27:17,184
Come on, who are you?

509
00:27:18,664 --> 00:27:19,464
Didn't you hear?

510
00:27:26,744 --> 00:27:27,816
Has General Fengyun

511
00:27:28,305 --> 00:27:28,944
arrived?

512
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:29,825
We haven't heard.

513
00:27:34,504 --> 00:27:35,704
How dare you fool

514
00:27:35,944 --> 00:27:37,464
falsely claim official titles?

515
00:27:37,744 --> 00:27:38,376
You

516
00:27:38,464 --> 00:27:39,825
abducted my family member.

517
00:27:40,545 --> 00:27:42,184
You're courting death.

518
00:27:56,345 --> 00:27:57,704
Ouch.

519
00:27:58,704 --> 00:27:59,385
It hurts.

520
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:03,224
Ling.

521
00:28:03,704 --> 00:28:04,264
Ling.

522
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:05,585
Father.

523
00:28:05,905 --> 00:28:06,785
Who did this to you?

524
00:28:07,065 --> 00:28:08,104
(Sun Xiangfu, Yezhou Magistrate)
Guards. He...

525
00:28:08,704 --> 00:28:09,224
Young master.

526
00:28:11,345 --> 00:28:11,976
Commander?

527
00:28:12,744 --> 00:28:13,352
Commander.

528
00:28:13,585 --> 00:28:14,905
I failed to welcome you

529
00:28:15,024 --> 00:28:15,585
properly.

530
00:28:15,664 --> 00:28:17,024
I beg for your forgiveness.

531
00:28:20,385 --> 00:28:22,024
Why is Magistrate Sun

532
00:28:22,065 --> 00:28:23,145
begging for forgiveness?

533
00:28:24,825 --> 00:28:26,385
Your son was quite domineering

534
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:27,625
upstairs earlier.

535
00:28:28,224 --> 00:28:29,865
First, he tried to abduct my servant,

536
00:28:30,264 --> 00:28:31,785
then he threatened to kill me.

537
00:28:32,305 --> 00:28:33,105
He even said

538
00:28:33,305 --> 00:28:34,585
he'd make me beg for death

539
00:28:34,744 --> 00:28:35,744
in front of my uncle.

540
00:28:35,984 --> 00:28:36,545
W-What...

541
00:28:36,704 --> 00:28:38,024
You're begging for forgiveness?

542
00:28:38,825 --> 00:28:39,385
Seriously.

543
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:40,625
We're terrified.

544
00:28:41,105 --> 00:28:42,088
Right?

545
00:28:42,184 --> 00:28:43,184
Uncle?

546
00:28:44,424 --> 00:28:46,264
Commander,
I failed to discipline my son.

547
00:28:46,345 --> 00:28:47,504
He didn't know who you were

548
00:28:47,504 --> 00:28:48,305
and offended you

549
00:28:48,305 --> 00:28:48,944
and...

550
00:28:49,785 --> 00:28:50,345
Cheng.

551
00:28:50,825 --> 00:28:51,664
Mr. Cheng.

552
00:28:52,224 --> 00:28:53,464
I sincerely...

553
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:54,424
I-I...

554
00:28:54,905 --> 00:28:55,585
Come here.

555
00:28:56,024 --> 00:28:56,664
Come here.

556
00:28:57,744 --> 00:28:58,385
Get over here.

557
00:28:59,545 --> 00:29:00,145
Lower.

558
00:29:01,585 --> 00:29:02,224
Lower.

559
00:29:03,145 --> 00:29:03,585
Father.

560
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:04,552
He hit me.

561
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,345
He hit you?

562
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:08,664
You should avenge me.

563
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:09,184
Avenge you?

564
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,545
I'll beat you to death.

565
00:29:10,825 --> 00:29:12,024
You're asking for this.

566
00:29:12,264 --> 00:29:13,385
You're asking for this.

567
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:14,744
Why are you hitting me?

568
00:29:14,865 --> 00:29:16,424
You're asking for this.

569
00:29:16,664 --> 00:29:17,264
You want me

570
00:29:17,585 --> 00:29:18,905
to avenge you?

571
00:29:19,464 --> 00:29:20,345
I don't even know

572
00:29:20,345 --> 00:29:21,264
if I'll survive this.

573
00:29:21,264 --> 00:29:21,944
Avenge you?

574
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:23,065
How about this?

575
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:24,184
I will

576
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:25,545
break my son's legs

577
00:29:25,585 --> 00:29:26,264
as an apology.

578
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:27,345
What do you think?

579
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:35,905
My mother has aged.

580
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:36,664
And this is

581
00:29:36,744 --> 00:29:37,545
my only son.

582
00:29:37,785 --> 00:29:38,704
If he dies,

583
00:29:38,984 --> 00:29:40,585
our family line ends with me.

584
00:29:41,145 --> 00:29:41,625
Please

585
00:29:41,984 --> 00:29:42,865
punish me instead

586
00:29:43,224 --> 00:29:44,545
and spare my son.

587
00:29:44,865 --> 00:29:45,264
Please.

588
00:29:46,984 --> 00:29:47,744
Mr. Sun.

589
00:29:48,825 --> 00:29:50,424
Your son doesn't have to recognize me.

590
00:29:51,024 --> 00:29:52,865
But the inspector is on his way here.

591
00:29:53,184 --> 00:29:53,944
If your son

592
00:29:54,024 --> 00:29:55,184
mistakes the inspector

593
00:29:55,345 --> 00:29:56,504
for an impostor,

594
00:29:57,024 --> 00:29:57,785
then he may

595
00:29:58,184 --> 00:29:59,585
have to die for it.

596
00:29:59,825 --> 00:30:00,504
It won't happen.

597
00:30:00,744 --> 00:30:01,424
It won't happen.

598
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:02,545
I assure you.

599
00:30:21,825 --> 00:30:23,264
Thank you, Commander.

600
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:27,504
Get up.

601
00:30:27,664 --> 00:30:28,184
Let's go.

602
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:29,184
Let's go.

603
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:33,320
Come back.

604
00:30:33,545 --> 00:30:34,504
Where are you going?

605
00:30:34,504 --> 00:30:35,560
This way.

606
00:30:35,704 --> 00:30:36,464
Let's go.

607
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:37,224
Faster.

608
00:30:37,464 --> 00:30:38,224
Get moving.

609
00:30:38,865 --> 00:30:40,024
Hurry.

610
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:41,464
Hurry.

611
00:30:41,785 --> 00:30:42,344
We're off.

612
00:31:02,545 --> 00:31:04,585
Sun Ling was abusing his power.

613
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,585
What a disgrace.

614
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,145
If I hadn't...

615
00:31:12,545 --> 00:31:13,145
Anyway,

616
00:31:13,424 --> 00:31:15,345
I ran into Miss Song on the street

617
00:31:15,385 --> 00:31:16,296
and brought her here.

618
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:23,208
I did this to promote

619
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:23,944
your reputation

620
00:31:23,944 --> 00:31:26,184
as a people's hero, Commander.

621
00:31:26,865 --> 00:31:27,704
I don't need that.

622
00:31:32,785 --> 00:31:33,504
I think

623
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,385
we should take Miss Song

624
00:31:35,385 --> 00:31:35,944
with us.

625
00:31:36,385 --> 00:31:37,424
If she stays in Yezhou,

626
00:31:37,424 --> 00:31:39,065
Sun Ling will surely retaliate.

627
00:31:39,545 --> 00:31:40,264
You rescued her.

628
00:31:40,905 --> 00:31:41,785
You'll handle it.

629
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:47,585
Mr. Xiao.

630
00:31:48,145 --> 00:31:49,320
I'm Song Taotao.

631
00:31:51,385 --> 00:31:52,105
Miss Song.

632
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:53,545
You know each other?

633
00:31:54,585 --> 00:31:55,264
I'm engaged

634
00:31:55,424 --> 00:31:56,785
to Mr. Xiao...

635
00:31:57,424 --> 00:31:58,145
What?

636
00:31:59,944 --> 00:32:00,680
Mr. Xiao's nephew.

637
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:03,264
Miss Song,

638
00:32:03,825 --> 00:32:05,385
don't leave sentences half-finished.

639
00:32:11,224 --> 00:32:11,825
Wait.

640
00:32:14,865 --> 00:32:15,504
Commander.

641
00:32:17,345 --> 00:32:18,568
How many nephews do you have?

642
00:32:22,184 --> 00:32:22,984
Wedding escape.

643
00:32:24,065 --> 00:32:24,825
Engagement.

644
00:32:28,585 --> 00:32:29,105
Y-You're...

645
00:32:29,264 --> 00:32:30,585
You're Cheng Lisu's...

646
00:32:30,585 --> 00:32:32,305
I'm Cheng Lisu's so-called

647
00:32:32,704 --> 00:32:33,424
fiancée.

648
00:32:37,585 --> 00:32:38,744
(I joined the army)

649
00:32:38,984 --> 00:32:39,976
(to escape marriage.)

650
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,744
(Then Song Taotao)

651
00:32:41,944 --> 00:32:43,385
(got engaged to Cheng Lisu.)

652
00:32:43,865 --> 00:32:45,825
(Both of them fled.)

653
00:32:46,385 --> 00:32:47,785
(How strange is fate.)

654
00:32:48,184 --> 00:32:49,345
(It's a cycle.)

655
00:32:49,744 --> 00:32:50,424
Mr. Xiao,

656
00:32:50,905 --> 00:32:51,625
can you take me

657
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:52,464
to Yezhou Garrison?

658
00:32:52,984 --> 00:32:54,345
I won't cause any trouble.

659
00:32:54,664 --> 00:32:55,785
Are you sure about that?

660
00:32:56,305 --> 00:32:57,184
Your fiancé

661
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:58,504
is right there.

662
00:32:58,825 --> 00:32:59,905
I'm looking for him.

663
00:33:04,145 --> 00:33:04,744
You've been

664
00:33:04,825 --> 00:33:06,105
impersonating Cheng Lisu, right?

665
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:08,424
The real Cheng Lisu
couldn't fight at all.

666
00:33:08,825 --> 00:33:09,545
I bet it's hard

667
00:33:09,825 --> 00:33:10,905
to impersonate him.

668
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:13,504
In that case,

669
00:33:14,024 --> 00:33:15,105
stay with us for now.

670
00:33:16,464 --> 00:33:17,585
You saved Miss Song.

671
00:33:18,345 --> 00:33:19,065
You'll handle it.

672
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,424
Me?

673
00:33:21,424 --> 00:33:23,385
She's your nephew's fiancée.

674
00:33:23,785 --> 00:33:24,664
That's not true.

675
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:27,464
You heard her.

676
00:33:35,385 --> 00:33:37,024
I lost my luggage and money

677
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:38,024
because of

678
00:33:38,065 --> 00:33:38,905
those hooligans.

679
00:33:39,944 --> 00:33:40,504
Could you

680
00:33:40,825 --> 00:33:42,305
front my room payment?

681
00:33:42,865 --> 00:33:43,984
I'll repay double...

682
00:33:44,385 --> 00:33:44,984
No.

683
00:33:45,345 --> 00:33:46,545
Tenfold.

684
00:33:50,184 --> 00:33:52,398
(Sun Mansion)

685
00:33:58,184 --> 00:34:00,625
Why did you have to provoke

686
00:34:02,224 --> 00:34:04,145
the living God of Death?

687
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:07,905
Come on.

688
00:34:08,544 --> 00:34:10,376
He's just a military officer.

689
00:34:10,865 --> 00:34:12,185
Father, why are you so timid?

690
00:34:13,424 --> 00:34:14,785
"Just a military officer"?

691
00:34:16,064 --> 00:34:17,424
When he followed

692
00:34:17,624 --> 00:34:18,624
Xiao Zhongwu west,

693
00:34:18,785 --> 00:34:20,185
he dared to behead the eldest son

694
00:34:20,345 --> 00:34:21,504
of the censor.

695
00:34:22,665 --> 00:34:23,385
Minister Xu

696
00:34:23,464 --> 00:34:24,345
brought this case

697
00:34:24,345 --> 00:34:25,305
to His Majesty.

698
00:34:25,544 --> 00:34:26,544
And what happened?

699
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,584
Minister Xu had to swallow his losses.

700
00:34:29,385 --> 00:34:30,584
If he actually kills you,

701
00:34:30,705 --> 00:34:31,984
what do you think

702
00:34:32,424 --> 00:34:33,345
I could do?

703
00:34:35,424 --> 00:34:37,665
Absolutely nothing.

704
00:34:40,185 --> 00:34:41,064
He...

705
00:34:41,225 --> 00:34:42,265
He's that powerful?

706
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:44,185
Then,

707
00:34:44,464 --> 00:34:45,544
what should we do?

708
00:34:45,825 --> 00:34:47,584
Take it easy.

709
00:34:49,584 --> 00:34:51,345
I've had a trap ready for a long time,

710
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:55,865
waiting to spring it.

711
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:01,024
Don't worry, son.

712
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,104
I'll make sure

713
00:35:03,345 --> 00:35:05,385
you're avenged.

714
00:35:07,745 --> 00:35:08,328
Father,

715
00:35:08,464 --> 00:35:09,584
I know you're the best.

716
00:35:09,984 --> 00:35:10,984
But for now,

717
00:35:11,544 --> 00:35:13,865
keep your head down.

718
00:35:16,944 --> 00:35:18,024
Get rid of

719
00:35:18,185 --> 00:35:19,705
the stuff

720
00:35:20,024 --> 00:35:20,905
you buried.

721
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:27,024
This box.

722
00:35:27,424 --> 00:35:28,200
I'll take some too.

723
00:35:29,144 --> 00:35:30,064
Cheng Lisu and I

724
00:35:30,064 --> 00:35:31,064
never got along.

725
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,936
But my father,

726
00:35:33,128 --> 00:35:34,544
who's Cheng Lusu's master,

727
00:35:34,944 --> 00:35:36,360
suddenly got a wild idea

728
00:35:36,504 --> 00:35:37,544
of getting us married.

729
00:35:37,984 --> 00:35:39,424
His family actually approved.

730
00:35:40,185 --> 00:35:41,785
I was planning to run away.

731
00:35:42,144 --> 00:35:42,785
But he actually

732
00:35:42,944 --> 00:35:43,905
beat me to it.

733
00:35:44,345 --> 00:35:45,144
It's a total

734
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:45,944
humiliation.

735
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:47,024
So, I came here

736
00:35:47,225 --> 00:35:47,944
to get him home

737
00:35:48,144 --> 00:35:49,584
and cancel the engagement.

738
00:35:50,024 --> 00:35:51,305
You don't like Mr. Cheng?

739
00:35:52,144 --> 00:35:53,464
I think he's quite admirable.

740
00:35:53,825 --> 00:35:54,745
Good-looking,

741
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:55,865
well-born,

742
00:35:55,944 --> 00:35:56,984
and a brilliant doctor.

743
00:35:56,984 --> 00:35:57,984
I bet he has

744
00:35:58,024 --> 00:35:59,064
many admirers

745
00:35:59,225 --> 00:35:59,984
in Yaojing.

746
00:36:00,464 --> 00:36:01,225
In medicine,

747
00:36:01,345 --> 00:36:02,024
the heart guides,

748
00:36:02,345 --> 00:36:03,176
the hands follow.

749
00:36:03,584 --> 00:36:04,385
But look at him.

750
00:36:04,785 --> 00:36:06,305
Instead of helping people,

751
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:07,504
he's buttering up

752
00:36:07,584 --> 00:36:09,104
the imperial consorts and princesses.

753
00:36:09,265 --> 00:36:10,185
So spineless.

754
00:36:10,424 --> 00:36:11,464
I despise him.

755
00:36:13,185 --> 00:36:14,104
You're much better.

756
00:36:17,745 --> 00:36:18,424
Well...

757
00:36:19,185 --> 00:36:20,424
It's not a fair comparison.

758
00:36:23,305 --> 00:36:24,136
Candies.

759
00:36:25,504 --> 00:36:26,584
Is this osmanthus-flavored?

760
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:27,024
Yeah.

761
00:36:27,104 --> 00:36:28,144
That's right.

762
00:36:30,745 --> 00:36:31,784
Even blind,

763
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:33,192
aim to be

764
00:36:33,745 --> 00:36:34,705
the most special of all.

765
00:36:36,064 --> 00:36:37,104
This osmanthus candy

766
00:36:37,785 --> 00:36:39,912
is the last piece left in the world.

767
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:41,944
Though inedible now,

768
00:36:42,865 --> 00:36:43,705
it remains sweet.

769
00:36:43,905 --> 00:36:44,776
I won't know

770
00:36:44,944 --> 00:36:46,024
until I taste it.

771
00:36:48,104 --> 00:36:48,840
Though

772
00:36:49,144 --> 00:36:50,305
bitter at first taste,

773
00:36:50,785 --> 00:36:51,584
its core holds

774
00:36:51,825 --> 00:36:52,936
enduring sweetness.

775
00:36:54,865 --> 00:36:55,785
Have it.

776
00:37:00,024 --> 00:37:00,865
I once had

777
00:37:00,905 --> 00:37:01,745
an osmanthus candy.

778
00:37:02,544 --> 00:37:03,305
Not so sweet.

779
00:37:03,944 --> 00:37:04,865
Even a bit bitter.

780
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:06,665
But it was the best

781
00:37:06,705 --> 00:37:07,984
osmanthus candy in the world.

782
00:37:11,265 --> 00:37:11,984
Someone also

783
00:37:12,024 --> 00:37:13,024
loves osmanthus candies.

784
00:37:13,624 --> 00:37:14,624
One packet please.

785
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:15,624
Alright.

786
00:37:17,385 --> 00:37:18,185
Is it

787
00:37:18,544 --> 00:37:19,464
for me?

788
00:37:21,185 --> 00:37:21,984
Want some?

789
00:37:22,504 --> 00:37:23,504
Buy your own.

790
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:24,584
This is a gift.

791
00:37:25,385 --> 00:37:25,944
There you go.

792
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:26,696
It's ready.

793
00:37:26,865 --> 00:37:27,584
Keep the change.

794
00:37:27,584 --> 00:37:28,424
Thank you.

795
00:37:28,984 --> 00:37:29,544
Let's go.

796
00:37:32,665 --> 00:37:33,864
Another girl's gone missing.

797
00:37:33,864 --> 00:37:34,825
It keeps happening

798
00:37:34,825 --> 00:37:35,544
over these years.

799
00:37:35,944 --> 00:37:37,265
They're nowhere to be found.

800
00:37:37,584 --> 00:37:38,265
It's tragic.

801
00:37:38,825 --> 00:37:39,665
They say that

802
00:37:39,984 --> 00:37:40,665
Young Master Sun

803
00:37:40,745 --> 00:37:42,584
abducts pretty girls every now and then.

804
00:37:42,984 --> 00:37:43,825
Nobody reported it?

805
00:37:44,024 --> 00:37:44,504
His father

806
00:37:44,665 --> 00:37:45,504
is the Magistrate.

807
00:37:45,825 --> 00:37:46,424
Actually,

808
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,905
once an eyewitness

809
00:37:48,064 --> 00:37:49,624
and the victim's family reported it.

810
00:37:49,905 --> 00:37:51,185
But both of them

811
00:37:51,345 --> 00:37:52,745
were beaten half to death

812
00:37:52,944 --> 00:37:53,785
and thrown out.

813
00:37:54,225 --> 00:37:54,984
After that,

814
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,265
nobody dared step forward.

815
00:37:58,504 --> 00:37:59,424
The other girls

816
00:37:59,665 --> 00:38:00,665
weren't as lucky as you.

817
00:38:04,345 --> 00:38:04,865
Don't worry.

818
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,504
I'll protect you.

819
00:38:08,865 --> 00:38:09,464
I know

820
00:38:09,825 --> 00:38:11,185
you'll always look out for me.

821
00:38:12,504 --> 00:38:13,185
Let's go.

822
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,144
Can't anyone do something

823
00:38:17,144 --> 00:38:18,152
about Young Master Sun?

824
00:38:21,944 --> 00:38:22,504
Commander.

825
00:38:23,665 --> 00:38:25,345
I was thinking about you while shopping

826
00:38:25,424 --> 00:38:26,424
with Miss Song.

827
00:38:26,785 --> 00:38:28,305
I bought you osmanthus candies.

828
00:38:30,984 --> 00:38:31,560
Try some.

829
00:38:32,024 --> 00:38:32,680
Take them away.

830
00:38:33,865 --> 00:38:34,385
Why?

831
00:38:34,544 --> 00:38:35,816
They're really sweet.

832
00:38:36,104 --> 00:38:36,944
I don't eat sweets.

833
00:38:37,345 --> 00:38:38,385
But you clearly...

834
00:38:42,144 --> 00:38:42,785
I clearly what?

835
00:38:44,225 --> 00:38:45,825
Putting loaches in my shoes.

836
00:38:50,064 --> 00:38:51,265
These candies got dirty.

837
00:38:52,745 --> 00:38:53,576
Don't eat those.

838
00:38:53,785 --> 00:38:55,345
Should I buy you new ones?

839
00:38:55,345 --> 00:38:56,345
No need. Go to class.

840
00:39:04,104 --> 00:39:04,984
You're just

841
00:39:06,104 --> 00:39:07,705
looking down on my cheap gifts.

842
00:39:08,665 --> 00:39:09,225
Fine,

843
00:39:09,385 --> 00:39:10,464
keep them for Mr. Feinu.

844
00:39:10,624 --> 00:39:11,688
He won't eat them, either.

845
00:39:12,168 --> 00:39:13,000
You...

846
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:15,705
Commander.

847
00:39:18,104 --> 00:39:19,464
The inspector made his appearance.

848
00:39:20,104 --> 00:39:21,144
So, Sun Xiangfu

849
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,544
will invite us to his mansion today.

850
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:25,865
Get ready.

851
00:39:26,504 --> 00:39:27,504
We're going today?

852
00:39:28,144 --> 00:39:29,024
He's invited us.

853
00:39:30,104 --> 00:39:31,705
The inspector

854
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,984
will likely be there too.

855
00:39:39,225 --> 00:39:39,745
Commander.

856
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:41,185
Are you worried about me?

857
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,024
Stop talking

858
00:39:44,185 --> 00:39:44,785
and think about

859
00:39:44,984 --> 00:39:46,624
how to maintain your cover.

860
00:39:47,265 --> 00:39:48,225
Cheng Lisu is

861
00:39:48,265 --> 00:39:49,448
a renowned noble in Yaojing.

862
00:39:49,584 --> 00:39:50,225
And you...

863
00:39:50,584 --> 00:39:51,665
In Yaojing,

864
00:39:52,225 --> 00:39:53,104
someone like me

865
00:39:53,665 --> 00:39:54,584
could at least

866
00:39:54,905 --> 00:39:56,464
rival Mr. Cheng, if not stand equal

867
00:39:56,504 --> 00:39:57,385
to you.

868
00:39:57,785 --> 00:39:58,464
Otherwise,

869
00:39:58,665 --> 00:39:59,825
why did Miss Song

870
00:40:00,305 --> 00:40:02,064
only remind me to be careful,

871
00:40:02,185 --> 00:40:03,185
and not you?

872
00:40:08,296 --> 00:40:09,051
(Sun Mansion)

873
00:40:09,064 --> 00:40:10,785
What an honor to have you here.

874
00:40:10,785 --> 00:40:12,345
My warmest welcome.

875
00:40:12,345 --> 00:40:13,865
My warmest welcome.

876
00:40:18,144 --> 00:40:19,504
This is the inspector,

877
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:21,225
Mr. Chu Zhao.

878
00:40:23,865 --> 00:40:24,504
Commander Xiao.

879
00:40:24,705 --> 00:40:25,464
Long time no see.

880
00:40:25,785 --> 00:40:26,504
Mr. Chu.

881
00:40:27,104 --> 00:40:27,865
Long time no see.

882
00:40:35,544 --> 00:40:36,385
(It's him?)

883
00:40:37,104 --> 00:40:38,865
