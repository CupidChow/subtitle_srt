00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,440
Thank you for coming all this way,

24
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,160
Mr. Chu, to help us

25
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,240
settle the issue

26
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,000
with Yezhou Garrison.

27
00:02:00,752 --> 00:02:02,440
Please, have some tea.

28
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,520
Don't mention it, Mr. Sun.

29
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,919
How is the Chancellor?

30
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,520
Master is fine,

31
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,360
though somewhat troubled.

32
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:16,159
Who dares to

33
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:17,439
cause distress

34
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:18,448
to the Chancellor?

35
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,999
Could it be Xiao Jue?

36
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,719
You're mistaken, Mr. Sun.

37
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,719
What troubles the Chancellor

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,719
is naturally the state affairs.

39
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:38,640
Of course.

40
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:39,839
Of course.

41
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,040
I merely wish to share

42
00:02:42,192 --> 00:02:43,088
his burdens.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,928
Mr. Chu.

44
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:49,719
You've traveled this great distance.

45
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,559
I've prepared a welcoming banquet.

46
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:52,400
I hope you will

47
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,960
grace us with your presence.

48
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:57,920
The guest of honor must be

49
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,599
Commander Xiao, right?

50
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,960
Speaking of Commander Xiao,

51
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:04,119
I have

52
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:06,159
so much to say.

53
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,520
He's sent me missives

54
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,399
since his appointment,

55
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,679
demanding either funds

56
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:11,520
or provisions.

57
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,200
But we're having

58
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,360
a difficult time

59
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,159
in Yezhou.

60
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,768
The Chancellor

61
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,240
is fully aware

62
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,559
of all the circumstances.

63
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,159
What are you implying, Mr. Sun?

64
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:30,920
Master resides in Yaojing.

65
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,119
How could he know what's going on here?

66
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,119
I misspoke.

67
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:40,599
I apologize.

68
00:03:42,928 --> 00:03:43,824
Ding Yi.

69
00:03:44,112 --> 00:03:45,040
Come here.

70
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,599
Meet Mr. Chu Zhao.

71
00:03:47,952 --> 00:03:48,912
Mr. Chu.

72
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,559
This is Ding Yi.

73
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,760
General Feihong

74
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,960
sent him over.

75
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:54,512
Greetings, Mr. Chu.

76
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:55,632
General says

77
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,159
I'm at your disposal

78
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,200
whenever you need me.

79
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:02,200
General Feihong is too kind.

80
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:03,536
I don't need you

81
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:04,400
for anything.

82
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:08,719
Mr. Chu.

83
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,719
Excuse me for a second.

84
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,119
Let me check on

85
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,279
the banquet.

86
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:13,960
With two distinguished guests here,

87
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:16,336
- I dare not make any mistakes.
- Indeed.

88
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,599
Make thorough preparation.

89
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:19,056
Master.

90
00:04:21,648 --> 00:04:22,352
Master.

91
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,880
It's Commander Xiao and Mr. Cheng.

92
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:27,600
Mr. Chu.

93
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,320
(Sun Mansion)
What an honor, Commander.

94
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:38,719
Forgive me for failing

95
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:40,520
to greet you properly.

96
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,039
Please meet the inspector,

97
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:46,760
Mr. Chu Zhao.

98
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,496
Commander Xiao.

99
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:49,440
Long time no see.

100
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,320
Mr. Chu.

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,719
Long time no see.

102
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,960
(It's him?)

103
00:04:58,919 --> 00:04:59,799
(Come to think of it,)

104
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,760
(I once swindled him.)

105
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:03,520
(But I did give him medicine.)

106
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,799
(I guess we're even.)

107
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,279
Nice to meet you.

108
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:07,680
Mr. Cheng.

109
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,039
(It looks like)

110
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,520
(he's not going to expose me)

111
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,479
(in public.)

112
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:15,880
I am

113
00:05:16,752 --> 00:05:17,839
Cheng Lisu.

114
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:19,039
Greetings, Inspector.

115
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,880
What is it, Father?

116
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,408
Ling.

117
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,039
Apologize to Commander Xiao

118
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,440
and Mr. Cheng.

119
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,239
Sorry, I have offended you.

120
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,200
Please kindly

121
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,760
forgive me.

122
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,599
Go on.

123
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,159
I'm unworthy of your anger.

124
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,479
So you realize that

125
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:57,719
you're unworthy?

126
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:06,719
Shall we be seated

127
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,760
first?

128
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,719
Commander.

129
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:11,000
You need to talk to Mr. Sun.

130
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:11,880
Go ahead.

131
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,320
Please.

132
00:06:39,306 --> 00:06:42,288
(Peace and Harmony)

133
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,359
Commander.

134
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,719
You assumed

135
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,159
your position some time ago.

136
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,479
I haven't had the chance

137
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:53,599
to pay my respects.

138
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:54,640
Instead,

139
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,000
you came to see me first.

140
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,599
I feel so guilty.

141
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,080
Let me

142
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,640
toast to you.

143
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:02,680
You're too kind.

144
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,359
I don't mind visiting

145
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,479
as long as we work out

146
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,159
the problems of supplies

147
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:09,640
and funds.

148
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,320
Commander, your words

149
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,919
make me burn with shame.

150
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,080
An army without supplies perishes.

151
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,960
That

152
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,120
I know.

153
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,880
I also want to handle it

154
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,239
perfectly.

155
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:28,320
It's just that

156
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:30,039
our county granary has had

157
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,640
no grain reserves for years.

158
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,039
I truly can't

159
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,520
raise any funds.

160
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,399
Despite such hardships,

161
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,320
you are still able

162
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:40,719
to treat us to such

163
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,120
lavish delicacies.

164
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:43,640
Mr. Sun,

165
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,599
you're too kind.

166
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,200
Don't mention it.

167
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,000
It's good

168
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,359
that the inspector is also here.

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,599
Mr. Chu,

170
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,960
we should absolutely look into

171
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:57,799
the tax ledger

172
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,479
for the tax collection details.

173
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:02,512
Was the tax left uncollected,

174
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,120
or was there foul play?

175
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,760
We're counting on you, Mr. Chu.

176
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:16,680
Mr. Sun.

177
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:18,919
I'm here.

178
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:19,960
Shouldn't you

179
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,719
toast Mr. Chu?

180
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:28,159
A timely reminder, Commander.

181
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,008
I was

182
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,719
almost rude.

183
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,000
Mr. Chu,

184
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,599
here is to you.

185
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,400
I beg your forgiveness.

186
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,752
Ling.

187
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,400
Please forgive me.

188
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,400
Please don't say that.

189
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,719
Duties take precedence.

190
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,920
Besides,

191
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:56,320
this concerns

192
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,519
the basic welfare of the soldiers,

193
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,960
which is the top priority.

194
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,879
I will spare no effort

195
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:03,879
in fulfilling my inspection duties.

196
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:06,119
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

197
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:10,560
We appreciate it.

198
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,639
Enough of unpleasant talks.

199
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:17,920
I will stay

200
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:19,960
at your mansion for a few days.

201
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,839
I hope

202
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:22,839
I won't ruin your mood, Mr. Sun.

203
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,960
Not at all.

204
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,400
It's my honor

205
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,920
to have you reside here.

206
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,160
To complement this occasion,

207
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,080
I have

208
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,599
prepared a little show

209
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:37,479
to enhance

210
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,200
festivities.

211
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:54,416
(Peace and Harmony)

212
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:58,359
(That man visited the Wanhua Pavilion)

213
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,440
(to select dancers.)

214
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,200
Someone.

215
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,759
Bring forth my aged vintage

216
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:25,280
from storage.

217
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,280
Let our guests sample it.

218
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,800
Commander.

219
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,200
Mr. Cheng.

220
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:54,040
Let me toast you both.

221
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,320
Bottoms up.

222
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:14,759
Uncle, I toast you.

223
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,960
Uncle.

224
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:19,879
It's poisoned.

225
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,040
This wine is poisoned.

226
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:25,328
I...

227
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,440
I had no idea.

228
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,280
Guards.

229
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,440
Oh my! Help!

230
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,160
Oh my! Assassins!

231
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:37,280
Assassins!

232
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,200
Sun Xiangfu.

233
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,400
Summon the guards.

234
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,800
Guards.

235
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
Guards.

236
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:46,560
Didn't you hear us?

237
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:47,759
Guards.

238
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:49,119
Are you dead?

239
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,479
Watch out.

240
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,239
Help.

241
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:22,839
Help me.

242
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:31,759
Help.

243
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,808
Uncle.

244
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,200
Guards.

245
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,519
Get the corpses out.

246
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,680
Wait.

247
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:51,359
Uncle.

248
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,280
I think

249
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,440
I've gone blind.

250
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:25,160
Assassins

251
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,040
and poisoned wine?

252
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,040
Any explanations?

253
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:35,888
Commander.

254
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,352
I swear I have no idea

255
00:15:38,352 --> 00:15:39,999
what happened here.

256
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:41,560
I know nothing

257
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,680
about the poison, either.

258
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,960
This happened in your mansion.

259
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:52,920
But your people

260
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,359
act completely innocent.

261
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,560
Isn't it ridiculous?

262
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,519
We don't know the dancers

263
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,800
and musicians.

264
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:04,119
They were hired.

265
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,296
Kneel.

266
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:10,280
- I...
- Kneel.

267
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,359
Kneel.

268
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:12,680
No matter what,

269
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,320
as head of the Sun family,

270
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:16,800
I failed to protect you

271
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,680
due to my negligence

272
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:20,440
and nearly caused a catastrophe.

273
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:22,359
I await your punishment, Commander.

274
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,239
Are you saying

275
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:30,479
that we should let this matter drop?

276
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,440
I dare not.

277
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,999
I'll get to the bottom of this.

278
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,519
All assassins took poison

279
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,160
and dropped dead.

280
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,800
I'm not leaving until

281
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:41,080
I find the truth.

282
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,800
I'll help you investigate,

283
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:44,320
Mr. Sun.

284
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,879
Commander Xiao is right.

285
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:50,839
As a witness,

286
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:51,999
I'm also obligated

287
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:53,200
to uncover the truth

288
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,759
and catch the culprit.

289
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:01,160
I appreciate it, Inspector.

290
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,440
How do you feel?

291
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:24,759
It's hurting less.

292
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,039
I'm just not used to it.

293
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,640
Earlier,

294
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,960
I requested

295
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,039
some soothing cream.

296
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,759
It should arrive soon.

297
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:38,319
Commander.

298
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:39,680
Don't worry about me.

299
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,559
Xiao Jue.

300
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,360
Are you feeling sorry for me?

301
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,519
Maybe you even feel guilty.

302
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,079
But actually,

303
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:58,600
you should praise me.

304
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,640
For what?

305
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,120
For being remarkable, obviously.

306
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:04,440
If I hadn't

307
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:05,880
stopped you from having the wine,

308
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,400
you'd be dead now.

309
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,440
I'm basically your lifesaver.

310
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:10,840
Isn't that impressive?

311
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:15,799
You don't seem distressed

312
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,400
about losing your sight.

313
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,880
Possibly forever.

314
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,920
(She's scared.)

315
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,759
(She's not as casual)

316
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:35,559
(as she appears.)

317
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:39,824
The blind aren't all the same.

318
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,640
With my capabilities,

319
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,960
I'll surely become

320
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:44,920
the most

321
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,039
formidable blind person.

322
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,840
What

323
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,160
happened tonight?

324
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,759
Did you

325
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:00,960
plot all this?

326
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,440
Well...

327
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:11,120
How can you be such a fool?

328
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,759
And you.

329
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,960
How dare you act so recklessly?

330
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:18,400
What should I

331
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,479
tell General Feihong?

332
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,239
Unless

333
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,719
he sent you here exactly for this.

334
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,719
Please, Mr. Chu.

335
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,759
Though we acted on our own,

336
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:36,799
it was solely

337
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,160
for the Chancellor's sake.

338
00:19:38,832 --> 00:19:39,408
You see.

339
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,680
Everyone here knows

340
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,039
that I work for the Chancellor.

341
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:42,999
Xiao Jue came

342
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,039
and humiliated me.

343
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,440
He's not coming after me.

344
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,759
He's after Mr. Xu!

345
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:47,360
Mr. Sun.

346
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,160
Your arrogance astounds me.

347
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,039
Yezhou barely contains

348
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:58,079
your inflated ego.

349
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,680
Please forgive me.

350
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:11,239
I don't care

351
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,079
what you do.

352
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:14,352
Anyway,

353
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,880
if Master's reputation suffers damage,

354
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:18,200
both you and I

355
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,039
will be held accountable.

356
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,479
It won't happen.

357
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:24,640
Rest assured.

358
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,719
Xiao Jue will not

359
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,200
leave Yezhou alive.

360
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,960
I dare not cause the Chancellor

361
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,079
any trouble.

362
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:32,360
I will make sure there are

363
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,360
no loose ends.

364
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:41,999
Take care, Mr. Chu.

365
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,200
We underestimated

366
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,960
Xiao Jue's martial prowess.

367
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,319
And that Cheng Lisu...

368
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:02,719
He spilled the wine

369
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:05,239
way too conveniently.

370
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,880
I think I have

371
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,719
seen him somewhere.

372
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,319
Commander.

373
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,279
Won't you look into

374
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:24,840
the assassination?

375
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:26,559
How did assassins

376
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,319
infiltrate the Sun Mansion?

377
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,759
Are the Suns truly innocent?

378
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:33,920
I came to ask for military funding

379
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,160
and consolidate control over

380
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,319
officials and merchants.

381
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:38,640
I can't

382
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:40,279
confront the Sun family

383
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:40,999
just yet.

384
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,810
(Great Virtue)

385
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:58,319
Don't move.

386
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:15,978
♪Constant yearning,
still vivid as our first meeting♪

387
00:22:17,008 --> 00:22:20,680
♪Endless gazing.
Step by step, falling deeper♪

388
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,319
Does it hurt?

389
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,408
No.

390
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,239
I'm used to it.

391
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,239
Just hand me the cup.

392
00:22:32,671 --> 00:22:37,986

Not really.

It's just that

Rest now.

424
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,400
I'll be right here

425
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,519
for you.

426
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:06,479
As you said, Commander,

427
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,519
the assassination must be linked

428
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,479
to Sun Xiangfu.

429
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,120
And the servant was

430
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:12,120
highly suspicious.

431
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,488
That's right.

432
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,039
This is our chance

433
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,120
to infiltrate them

434
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,519
and get to

435
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,279
the bottom of everything.

436
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,759
I discovered a hidden chamber here

437
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,120
last time.

438
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:25,680
The tax ledger

439
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:26,719
is likely hidden there.

440
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:28,360
But I was in a rush

441
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,400
and the chamber was

442
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,440
heavily guarded, so...

443
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:32,360
It's fine.

444
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:34,120
Since we are living here,

445
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,039
we'll find a chance.

446
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,400
But He Yan

447
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,360
was implicated.

448
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:11,360
(Xiao Jue is even more of a trouble
than I imagined,)

449
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,400
(closing in step by step.)

450
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,840
(We must hide the tax ledger well.)

451
00:26:18,093 --> 00:26:18,640
(Tax Ledger)

452
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,920
(If Xiao Jue figures out)

453
00:26:19,999 --> 00:26:21,519
(that the tax records)

454
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,559
(are falsified,)

455
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:24,279
(we're finished.)

456
00:26:41,424 --> 00:26:42,607
(Account Book)

457
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,400
(My life depends on this.)

458
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,719
(As long as I hold on to this,)

459
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,560
(Mr. Xu won't let anything)

460
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,680
(happen to me.)

461
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:03,799
(Otherwise,)

462
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,640
(I'll drag him down with me.)

463
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:15,880
(How dare Chu Zhao)

464
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,719
(boss me around, acting arrogantly?)

465
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,440
(I must remind him.)

466
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:22,840
That he himself

467
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,360
is merely another one of Mr. Xu's

468
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,160
lackeys.

469
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,440
Have some porridge.

470
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,920
Thank you, Uncle.

471
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,279
You've worked hard.

472
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:52,279
I don't mind taking care

473
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,719
of my nephew.

474
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,120
Then could you please

475
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,400
get me some side dishes

476
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:58,479
for the porridge?

477
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:04,880
And perhaps some

478
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,559
family discipline.

479
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,440
Open up.

480
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,120
Commander.

481
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,479
Mr. Cheng.

482
00:28:14,288 --> 00:28:14,920
This is

483
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,799
our most famous

484
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:16,680
and best oculist

485
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,999
in Yezhou.

486
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,479
Physician, you're finally here.

487
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,239
This morning,

488
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,039
I had cassia seeds

489
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,039
with white peony root.

490
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:28,360
I feel much better now.

491
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,400
Please examine me.

492
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:30,360
Good.

493
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:32,880
Cassia seeds do improve vision.

494
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,239
But still,

495
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,279
let me

496
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,440
examine you properly.

497
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,559
(She can see?)

498
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,160
Physician.

499
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,160
We're both physicians.

500
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,039
While cassia seeds improve vision,

501
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:35,840
combining with white peony roots

502
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,479
causes abdominal discomfort.

503
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,759
As a physician,

504
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,640
surely you know this?

505
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:50,160
You're right, Mr. Cheng.

506
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,200
I am

507
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,519
getting senile

508
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:53,519
and confused.

509
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:55,759
I almost made a grave mistake.

510
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,079
It's alright.

511
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:58,880
Just prescribe me something

512
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,999
more effective.

513
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:01,719
But

514
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:02,719
make it less bitter.

515
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,120
Do as he says.

516
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:07,799
Alright.

517
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,200
(That powder was strong.)

518
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,120
(I did lose my vision)

519
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:31,680
(when it got into my eyes.)

520
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,880
(Without the drug)

521
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,759
(Master left me,)

522
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,719
(I'd be blind again.)

523
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:39,840
(Since they think I'm blind,)

524
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,799
(I'll play along)

525
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:43,759
(to lower their guard)

526
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,759
(for our plan.)

527
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,200
(After all,)

528
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,840
(nobody guards against a blind person.)

529
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:12,759
(Let's see how long)

530
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,120
(you'll keep this act.)

531
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,160
(Did he)

532
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:22,440
(notice something?)

533
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,319
Brewing medicine takes time.

534
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:32,519
Go get some air.

535
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:36,079
Alright.

536
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,559
Proxy kill was my plan.

537
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,200
Too bad the proxy's an idiot.

538
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:44,120
Now the enemy is alerted.

539
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,200
Time's running out.

540
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,239
Locate the hidden ledger of Sun Xiangfu

541
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,039
and Master's dealings quickly.

542
00:31:49,744 --> 00:31:50,352
Understood.

543
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,440
Mind the step.

544
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,600
(Peace and Prosperity)

545
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:13,200
It hurts!

546
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,120
Commander's waist is indeed slender.

547
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,440
That's enough.

548
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:27,960
Uncle.

549
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,319
Where are we going?

550
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:31,680
Would I abandon you?

551
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,600
Just follow me.

552
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,640
Uncle?

553
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,640
Uncle.

554
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:03,200
Uncle!

555
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,600
Unbelievable!

556
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,239
He actually left me alone.

557
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:20,239
Hey! Someone!

558
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,759
I can't see.

559
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,640
I'm blind. I'm lost.

560
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,400
Hey! Help!

561
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:25,400
Where am I?

562
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,559
What is this place?

563
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:28,400
No entry here.

564
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:29,039
W-Who are you?

565
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:29,640
Go back now.

566
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,160
Why are you pulling me?

567
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:32,640
Do you know who I am?

568
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,719
Why are you pulling me?

569
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:34,519
Let go.

570
00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:37,279
Stop pulling me.

571
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,840
I'm blind. You're bullying me.

572
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:42,479
I'm lost.

573
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,279
Take me back, will you?

574
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:48,120
Find my uncle.

575
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,319
(The top part's way smoother)

576
00:34:11,319 --> 00:34:12,160
(than the rest.)

577
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,240
(Someone touches it very often.)

578
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,320
Let go. I can walk.

579
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:37,999
Young Master.

580
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:38,880
Get lost.

581
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,559
Why should I

582
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,440
visit Xiao Jue?

583
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,599
I'm not going.

584
00:35:42,999 --> 00:35:44,280
I'd rather go to sleep.

585
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:45,679
(Oh no.)

586
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,639
(Sun Ling is back.)

587
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,800
(The mechanism is so complex.)

588
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,840
(It only opens if I pull)

589
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:56,079
(the copper strips)

590
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:56,960
(in the right order.)

591
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,720
(A single mistake)

592
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,920
(might destroy what's in there.)

593
00:36:07,178 --> 00:36:09,360
(Fortune and Blessing)

594
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:10,079
I...

595
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,240
I can walk.

596
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,039
I'm going back.

597
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:13,400
I-I remember.

598
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:13,960
This way.

599
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,440
Stop.

600
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,079
No way.

601
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:15,920
What do you mean?

602
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,639
My room's over there.

603
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,760
Why's it so messy?

604
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,999
Let go.

605
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,240
This way.

606
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,440
Someone was in my room.

607
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:23,800
Let me go.

608
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,679
Stop pushing me.

609
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,720
That old man is so annoying,

610
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,280
hiding his stuff in my room

611
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:48,800
and barging in uninvited.

612
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,199
I swear I'll move out.

613
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,679
I'm the guest of honor

614
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,280
your master invited.

615
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:56,720
Alright, Cheng Lisu.

616
00:36:56,999 --> 00:36:58,440
We'll settle all our scores now.

617
00:36:58,479 --> 00:36:59,440
Let me go.

618
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:04,999
They're killing me.

619
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:06,840
The servants are killing me.

620
00:37:06,999 --> 00:37:08,240
Why are you pushing me?

621
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,400
You trying to kill me?

622
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,479
Now I'm "pushing".

623
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,639
Got it?

624
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,999
I thought it was someone unworthy,

625
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,720
but it's Young Master Sun.

626
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:21,280
- Stop!
- You...

627
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:24,240
Mr. Chu.

628
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,039
Is this how you

629
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:26,920
treat your guests?

630
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,119
Inspector.

631
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,400
You okay?

632
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:31,920
Everything's fine.

633
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,040
A misunderstanding.

634
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,360
I saw Mr. Cheng

635
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,079
struggling

636
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:36,639
and tried to help.

637
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:38,880
But I was too rough

638
00:37:39,479 --> 00:37:40,760
and ended up hurting him.

639
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:42,639
Since you hurt him

640
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:43,479
by mistake,

641
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,199
you should apologize

642
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:46,400
to Mr. Cheng.

643
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,240
Of course.

644
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,519
My apologies.

645
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:57,119
Mr. Cheng, I hope you could

646
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,519
forgive me.

647
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,199
For the inspector's sake,

648
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:04,800
I'll let it slide.

649
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,079
Since you talked it out,

650
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,639
I'll walk Mr. Cheng back.

651
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,440
I appreciate it, Inspector.

652
00:38:11,952 --> 00:38:12,624
This way.

653
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:18,160
Alright.

654
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:19,504
Let's go.

655
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:30,999
Be careful.

656
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:40,599
Are you okay?

657
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:41,680
I'm fine.

658
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,720
I'm fine.

659
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:44,479
I just stumbled a bit.

660
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:45,720
Inspector.

661
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:47,199
I can walk by myself.

662
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:48,208
See?

663
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,240
I can manage.

664
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:55,999
I thought

665
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:57,159
you'd be more casual,

666
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:58,999
but you really observe propriety.

667
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,159
As the saying goes,

668
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:02,479
"A noble man

669
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,240
conducts himself
with unwavering integrity

670
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:06,559
and propriety."

671
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,519
Careful, steps ahead.

672
00:39:10,864 --> 00:39:11,472
Alright.

673
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,440
I got this.

674
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:23,248
(Great Virtue)

675
00:39:23,248 --> 00:39:23,800
We're here.

676
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,559
Inspector.

677
00:39:25,872 --> 00:39:26,480
Come in.

678
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:36,599
Be careful.

679
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:37,968
I'm fine.

680
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:39,088
I'm fine.

681
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:44,400
Suit yourself, Inspector.

682
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:52,639
Let me.

683
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,999
"Inspector" sounds

684
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:02,960
way too distant.

685
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:06,679
In that case,

686
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,039
I'll boldly

687
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:09,440
address you as Mr. Chu.

688
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,440
Very good.

689
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,720
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

690
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,440
Where does that come from?

691
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:20,920
Some things transcend words.

692
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,960
I bet you understand. Mr. Chu.

693
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,760
If you say so,

694
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,559
then I suppose I do.

695
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:31,920
Mr. Chu.

696
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,720
Mr. Sun would like to see you.

697
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,280
Attend to your duties, Mr. Chu.

698
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:46,519
Rest well.
