00:01:48,528 --> 00:01:49,384
Right.

24
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:51,489
Now that we're in the capital,

25
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:55,528
it's do or die.

26
00:01:56,712 --> 00:02:00,168
(Yuzun Pavilion)

27
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:12,200
Mr. He.

28
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:17,000
You're here.

29
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:18,289
Mr. Chu.

30
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:19,144
What a coincidence.

31
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:22,769
Is this a gift for someone?

32
00:02:23,568 --> 00:02:24,489
Exactly.

33
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:25,968
I'm staying at the Xiao Mansion.

34
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:27,329
This is for Mr. Xiao

35
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:28,232
and his wife.

36
00:02:28,568 --> 00:02:29,408
(This person)

37
00:02:29,408 --> 00:02:30,609
(looks very familiar.)

38
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:37,289
(She resembles the woman
in the painting.)

39
00:02:40,712 --> 00:02:42,489
Mr. Chu, who is this lady?

40
00:02:43,688 --> 00:02:44,648
Well...

41
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:45,929
Who are you?

42
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:47,368
Are you close with Zilan?

43
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:49,960
I'm He Yan,

44
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:51,209
a friend of Mr. Chu.

45
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:55,688
Mr. Chu,

46
00:02:55,688 --> 00:02:56,528
I'll take my leave.

47
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,376
See you.

48
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:07,336
(Ganming Pavilion)

49
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:11,329
Yuzun Pavilion, right?

50
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:13,192
Let's go.

51
00:03:15,912 --> 00:03:19,848
(Yuzun Pavilion)

52
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,248
(It seems)

53
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:23,248
(Chu Zhao is interested)

54
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:24,528
(in He Yan.)

55
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,729
(I wonder)

56
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:28,648
(how Miss Xu will react)

57
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,009
(when she finds out?)

58
00:03:30,107 --> 00:03:32,040
(Xu Mansion)

59
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:39,752
Miss Xu.

60
00:03:44,568 --> 00:03:45,769
You seem

61
00:03:45,929 --> 00:03:46,968
upset.

62
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:50,088
What's it to you?

63
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:53,929
Have you heard the story

64
00:03:54,248 --> 00:03:56,209
about the female general of Jiyang?

65
00:03:58,449 --> 00:03:59,929
Female general of Jiyang?

66
00:04:01,192 --> 00:04:02,128
Never mind.

67
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:03,128
You showed such

68
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:04,889
refreshing honesty earlier.

69
00:04:05,032 --> 00:04:06,432
Had you taken up sword and service,

70
00:04:06,432 --> 00:04:07,272
history would

71
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:09,169
remember you as renowned
as that female general.

72
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:11,449
Haven't you heard, Miss Xu?

73
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:12,929
The female general He Yan

74
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:14,248
achieved remarkable feats

75
00:04:14,368 --> 00:04:15,329
in the battle of Jiyang,

76
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,409
defending the city.

77
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:18,289
She is a role model for women.

78
00:04:18,688 --> 00:04:21,089
By the way,
she's just returned to Yaojing.

79
00:04:22,248 --> 00:04:23,208
He Yan?

80
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:29,000
Mr. He.

81
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:31,240
You're here.

82
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:32,768
What a coincidence, Mr. Chu.

83
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:34,609
He Yan

84
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,328
is actually a woman?

85
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:37,448
Correct.

86
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:39,248
She's a good female general.

87
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:40,529
I hear

88
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:41,729
that even Mr. Chu

89
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,609
holds her in high regard.

90
00:04:44,424 --> 00:04:45,328
Though

91
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:46,248
whispers of her serving

92
00:04:46,248 --> 00:04:47,268
in the army cross-dressed

93
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:49,208
have reached the common folk,

94
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:51,448
it remains unknown to His Majesty.

95
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:52,929
His Majesty even made her

96
00:04:53,368 --> 00:04:54,408
Attendant Wu'an.

97
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:56,448
Who knows

98
00:04:56,448 --> 00:04:57,448
what will happen

99
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:58,609
to He Yan

100
00:04:58,929 --> 00:04:59,808
if His Majesty

101
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,169
discovers the truth?

102
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:06,728
Naturally,

103
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:09,049
it's a capital offense.

104
00:05:18,395 --> 00:05:19,336
Hey!

105
00:05:19,888 --> 00:05:20,968
Are you zoning out?

106
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,128
General Yan.

107
00:05:30,128 --> 00:05:31,969
I am glad to see you.

108
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:33,208
Please.

109
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,216
Sit and drink with me.

110
00:05:44,489 --> 00:05:46,049
You treat He Yan quite specially.

111
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:47,929
I came to see you,

112
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:49,609
yet you didn't even pour me liquor?

113
00:05:50,248 --> 00:05:51,208
You have hands.

114
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:52,289
I do have hands.

115
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:53,320
But he doesn't?

116
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:04,424
It's chilly.

117
00:06:06,328 --> 00:06:07,248
I'll fetch you a coat.

118
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:13,849
I'm just saying.

119
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:15,880
Why did he take it seriously?

120
00:06:16,688 --> 00:06:17,688
Actually,

121
00:06:17,688 --> 00:06:18,536
all these years,

122
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:20,409
he's only shown concerns

123
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:21,416
about He Rufei.

124
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:22,649
But now,

125
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,609
he cares about you too.

126
00:06:24,616 --> 00:06:25,529
You seem

127
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:27,128
slightly better than He Rufei.

128
00:06:27,448 --> 00:06:28,969
But don't go doing the things he did.

129
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:31,688
He cares about He Rufei?

130
00:06:32,888 --> 00:06:34,169
You might not believe this.

131
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:35,808
Xiao Jue

132
00:06:35,808 --> 00:06:37,609
painstakingly taught General Feihong

133
00:06:37,888 --> 00:06:39,289
Qinglang Sword Style

134
00:06:39,328 --> 00:06:40,360
day after day.

135
00:06:40,688 --> 00:06:41,849
How is that possible?

136
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:43,089
Why wouldn't it be?

137
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:44,568
I saw it with my own eyes.

138
00:06:54,808 --> 00:06:55,929
No, like this?

139
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:19,289
Xiao Jue,

140
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:20,248
you're secretly standing

141
00:07:20,888 --> 00:07:21,969
outside He Rufei's room

142
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:24,289
just to teach a fool swordsmanship?

143
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:25,969
You secretly followed me

144
00:07:26,408 --> 00:07:27,328
just to watch me

145
00:07:27,328 --> 00:07:28,248
coach a fool?

146
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,808
T-That's not the same.

147
00:07:30,328 --> 00:07:31,368
Have you lost your mind?

148
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:33,049
Why waste time on a fool

149
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:33,960
like him?

150
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:39,489
Are you even listening to me?

151
00:07:39,768 --> 00:07:40,849
Why bother

152
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:41,768
with a fool?

153
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:43,849
I don't consider it a waste of time.

154
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:45,888
You coach him daily,

155
00:07:46,088 --> 00:07:47,049
yet his progress

156
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,208
is barely noticeable.

157
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:50,328
He gets help from a top student,

158
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:51,529
yet he remains mediocre.

159
00:07:52,328 --> 00:07:53,289
It's laughable.

160
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:55,289
I'll go tell him right now

161
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:56,969
that if he's got no talent,

162
00:07:57,328 --> 00:07:58,489
he shouldn't waste your time.

163
00:07:58,888 --> 00:07:59,816
Let's fight a duel.

164
00:08:02,808 --> 00:08:04,248
I once tried so hard to force him

165
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:05,768
to accept my challenge.

166
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:07,089
Yet he always refused.

167
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:08,609
But he agreed

168
00:08:08,768 --> 00:08:09,649
because I promised

169
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,688
to keep it a secret

170
00:08:12,128 --> 00:08:13,192
from the ingrate He Rufei.

171
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:14,888
Can you believe it?

172
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,208
Xiao Jue must be blind.

173
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:20,368
Each one at Xianchang Academy

174
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:23,609
is better than He Rufei,

175
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:25,128
an ungrateful wretch.

176
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:49,800
So that's how these

177
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,368
Qinglang Sword Style techniques work.

178
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:54,328
Who kindly

179
00:08:54,328 --> 00:08:55,929
left these notes to me?

180
00:09:00,648 --> 00:09:01,512
(Feet still. Reverse sword spin.
Sweep waist, thrust left)

181
00:09:05,704 --> 00:09:06,600
(Feet planted, turn left,
step right into bow stance)

182
00:09:18,369 --> 00:09:19,369
There's more.

183
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:22,249
Once during archery class,

184
00:09:22,632 --> 00:09:23,889
He Rufei forgot his thumb ring.

185
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:24,769
Xiao Jue

186
00:09:24,808 --> 00:09:25,889
gave his own spare

187
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:26,808
(to He Rufei.)

188
00:09:29,968 --> 00:09:31,016
Where's my thumb ring?

189
00:10:00,848 --> 00:10:01,848
Size doesn't matter.

190
00:10:01,848 --> 00:10:02,728
Better than nothing.

191
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,529
Are you even listening to me?

192
00:10:12,608 --> 00:10:13,769
What took Xiao Jue

193
00:10:14,328 --> 00:10:15,568
so long?

194
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:17,169
Whatever.

195
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:18,369
My wife is waiting for me.

196
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:19,976
I'm leaving.

197
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:30,129
So, that's how it was.

198
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,289
What is inside?

199
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:17,889
(You left a letter)

200
00:11:18,448 --> 00:11:19,289
and a pouch,

201
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:20,289
and then disappeared.

202
00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:22,369
What's that about?

203
00:11:26,688 --> 00:11:27,592
What?

204
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:29,208
You left something else?

205
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:31,048
Nothing else.

206
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:57,688
Yan He couldn't wait

207
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,272
and left.

208
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:02,888
It's okay.

209
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:07,328
Put your cloak on.

210
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:15,249
All these days,

211
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:18,688
it's been like walking through darkness

212
00:12:19,968 --> 00:12:21,009
alone.

213
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:24,769
No one noticed my existence.

214
00:12:26,488 --> 00:12:27,560
No one cared about

215
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:29,088
my joys or sorrows.

216
00:12:30,968 --> 00:12:32,169
No cheers,

217
00:12:33,568 --> 00:12:34,769
and no apologies.

218
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:37,649
Happiness or grief,

219
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,448
beginnings or endings,

220
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:42,488
it was a story about a lonely person.

221
00:12:48,688 --> 00:12:49,688
Until one day,

222
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:53,129
someone saw me.

223
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:56,409
(Back at Xianchang Academy,)

224
00:12:57,129 --> 00:12:58,920
(the one secretly
teaching me swordsmanship)

225
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:01,032
was you.

226
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:03,728
(The one who lent me a thumb ring)

227
00:13:05,848 --> 00:13:06,888
was also you.

228
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:08,769
Why were you so kind to me?

229
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:10,929
Back then,

230
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:13,512
(I was timid)

231
00:13:14,488 --> 00:13:15,560
(and felt inferior.)

232
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:18,129
(Nobody respected me.)

233
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,088
To be honest,

234
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:29,728
at first, I did look down on you.

235
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:32,529
But you are so tenacious

236
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:33,889
and stubborn.

237
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,889
You never give up on yourself.

238
00:13:38,728 --> 00:13:39,848
Perhaps our situations

239
00:13:39,848 --> 00:13:40,769
are too similar.

240
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:43,049
At such a young age,

241
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:45,369
we chose

242
00:13:45,369 --> 00:13:46,688
to shoulder the family's burdens.

243
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:49,448
My life

244
00:13:49,448 --> 00:13:50,409
was also once low-point.

245
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:52,409
Sometimes,

246
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:54,608
I felt helpless.

247
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:57,929
That's why whenever I saw you

248
00:13:57,929 --> 00:13:58,769
practicing alone

249
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:00,688
so hard,

250
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:04,808
I saw myself reflected in you.

251
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:07,409
I couldn't help but want

252
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:08,968
to be kind to you.

253
00:14:10,448 --> 00:14:11,289
It felt like

254
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:15,088
compensating for my younger self.

255
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:21,032
Look.

256
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:23,049
Tonight's moon

257
00:14:25,568 --> 00:14:26,409
is so beautiful.

258
00:14:51,088 --> 00:14:52,072
Are you

259
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:53,889
returning this to me

260
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:55,409
because it looks ugly?

261
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:07,328
You noticed.

262
00:15:10,728 --> 00:15:12,169
It looks terrible.

263
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:22,968
I wish to be like the bright moon,

264
00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:24,568
guarding you forever.

265
00:15:25,627 --> 00:15:27,035
(Rundu is in peril. I'm going to help.
I need your sword.)

♪Walking through the crowd,

00:15:39,608 --> 00:15:40,769
it breaks my heart.

269
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:43,208
Go on.

270
00:15:44,008 --> 00:15:45,049
You and I met

271
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:46,249
in a former life.

272
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:52,169
I was once a female general.

273
00:15:53,249 --> 00:15:54,216
I thought

274
00:15:54,448 --> 00:15:55,448
you'd say "I will be."

275
00:15:56,608 --> 00:15:57,608
The last secret.

276
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:03,049
I love the moon.

277
00:16:03,808 --> 00:16:05,009
Yet the moon doesn't know.

279
00:16:14,328 --> 00:16:15,448

280
00:16:17,169 --> 00:16:18,216
Yes.

Now,

285
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:41,169
the moon belongs to you.

286
00:16:44,872 --> 00:16:46,929
You're the first one
I taught swordsmanship to.

287
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:50,728
(You're the first one
I tended wounds to.)

288
00:16:52,584 --> 00:16:54,184
(You're the first one I gave candy to.)

289
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:57,808
(You're the first one)

290
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,168
(I bought clothes for.)

291
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:06,048
You're the first girl

292
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:08,168
I tried to comfort.

293
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:11,688
(You're the first one)

294
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:13,832
(I covered for.)

295
00:17:17,968 --> 00:17:19,008
Finally, I realize

296
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:22,440
that in my life,

297
00:17:22,768 --> 00:17:24,169
the only person I love

298
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:28,288
is you.

305

Since Xiao Jue and your sister

306
00:18:14,248 --> 00:18:16,569
already suspect you,

307
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:19,609
they'll maintain high alert

308
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:23,369
during the return to the capital.

309
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,849
Our failure this time

310
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:27,409
was expected.

311
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:29,768
Chancellor.

312
00:18:29,768 --> 00:18:30,849
What's our next move?

313
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,089
Perhaps

314
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:33,728
we strike first

315
00:18:33,896 --> 00:18:35,106
before they meet His Majesty.

316
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:37,288
Our earlier failure

317
00:18:37,968 --> 00:18:40,768
means we've lost the best chance.

318
00:18:41,448 --> 00:18:43,968
You must stay calm now.

319
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:45,768
Currently,

320
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:47,929
their biggest obstacle

321
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,809
is a lack of evidence.

322
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,569
So,

323
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:54,008
you shouldn't act rashly,

324
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,129
avoiding giving them leverage.

325
00:18:56,728 --> 00:18:58,609
I can't keep calm, Chancellor.

326
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,208
They're coming to the capital

327
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,089
to find evidence.

328
00:19:01,248 --> 00:19:02,649
Are we just doing nothing?

329
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:04,889
There's a prerequisite

330
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:07,048
that the evidence exists.

331
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:13,728
Did you

332
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:18,488
leave any trace of what we did?

333
00:19:19,528 --> 00:19:20,456
Chancellor.

334
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:22,448
He Yan and I

335
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,129
cannot coexist in this world.

336
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:25,369
Therefore,

337
00:19:25,768 --> 00:19:27,048
since I worked with you,

338
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:29,768
I've held nothing back from you.

339
00:19:57,609 --> 00:19:58,968
Tonight's Mid-Autumn banquet

340
00:20:00,248 --> 00:20:01,609
marks the beginning.

341
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:03,912
I will

342
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:06,809
settle things clearly

343
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:09,649
with He Rufei.

344
00:20:30,248 --> 00:20:31,304
Huaijin.

345
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:32,712
Are you ready?

346
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:34,089
I've been waiting

347
00:20:35,248 --> 00:20:36,609
so long for this.

348
00:20:58,968 --> 00:20:59,809
I guess

349
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:02,169
this must be

350
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,288
He Rufei, the renowned

351
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:05,609
General Feihong.

352
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,409
I am He Yan,

353
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:16,369
Attendant Wu'an.

354
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,288
General Feihong,

355
00:21:23,288 --> 00:21:24,528
are you feeling unwell?

356
00:21:25,768 --> 00:21:27,448
You should stay at Yuhua Temple

357
00:21:27,488 --> 00:21:28,329
for your health.

358
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:30,048
Its location is excellent.

359
00:21:30,488 --> 00:21:32,169
It's ideal for physical recuperation.

360
00:21:36,048 --> 00:21:37,809
You're just second-rate.

361
00:21:38,248 --> 00:21:39,208
I won't

362
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,008
stoop to your level.

363
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,129
Second-rate?

364
00:21:44,768 --> 00:21:45,768
His Majesty made He Yan

365
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:46,849
Attendant Wu'an.

366
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:48,968
Are you

367
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:51,488
questioning His Majesty's judgment?

368
00:22:02,768 --> 00:22:03,968
Take it one step at a time.

369
00:22:04,136 --> 00:22:05,409
- Right?
- Sure.

370
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:06,809
That makes sense.

371
00:22:12,048 --> 00:22:13,000
Huaijin.

372
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:14,688
Why does Mr. Yang seem

373
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:16,288
to hate you?

374
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:18,008
Back in Chonghuai,

375
00:22:18,248 --> 00:22:19,728
I heard from Yang Mingzhi

376
00:22:19,849 --> 00:22:21,329
about your conflict with Mr. Yang.

377
00:22:22,488 --> 00:22:23,768
It puzzled me greatly back then.

378
00:22:24,089 --> 00:22:25,889
I've long heard

379
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:27,609
that Mr. Yang, Minister of War,

380
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:29,048
is upright

381
00:22:29,329 --> 00:22:30,409
and loyal to His Majesty.

382
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:32,488
How could he ally with Xu Jingfu?

383
00:22:33,008 --> 00:22:34,089
Once in a morning meeting,

384
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:35,929
Mr. Yang's aggressive stance

385
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:37,849
incensed me.

386
00:22:38,688 --> 00:22:39,649
But upon reflection,

387
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:41,169
I think he is

388
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:42,280
excessively upright.

389
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:43,368
He sees the world

390
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,569
in black and white.

391
00:22:45,688 --> 00:22:46,536
So,

392
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:47,849
Xu Jingfu

393
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:48,809
used him

394
00:22:50,089 --> 00:22:51,288
as a pawn against others.

395
00:23:11,688 --> 00:23:12,849
Mr. Liu, cheers.

396
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:15,329
Cheers.

397
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:16,369
Let's drink.

398
00:23:16,488 --> 00:23:17,384
Let's drink.

399
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:22,376
Let's drink.

400
00:23:35,592 --> 00:23:36,569
Drink.

401
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:37,512
Drink.

402
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:55,720
Drink.

403
00:23:57,704 --> 00:23:58,609
To you.

404
00:23:58,609 --> 00:23:59,592
To you.

405
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:08,688
- Excellent.
- Excellent.

406
00:24:11,176 --> 00:24:12,129
Splendid.

407
00:24:12,129 --> 00:24:13,329
The dance was superb.

408
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,728
Is Attendant Wu'an present?

409
00:24:25,768 --> 00:24:26,649
I, He Yan,

410
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:30,008
pay respects, Your Majesty.

411
00:24:31,688 --> 00:24:32,680
Rise.

412
00:24:33,288 --> 00:24:34,344
Thank you, Your Majesty.

413
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,488
Attendant Wu'an,

414
00:24:37,488 --> 00:24:38,488
you raided enemies

415
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:39,609
at night,

416
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,728
burned their granaries,

417
00:24:40,968 --> 00:24:41,809
and defeated Wutuo

418
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:43,169
in Rundu.

419
00:24:43,488 --> 00:24:44,889
I've heard much about your feats.

420
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:46,129
You are

421
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:48,849
a capable young man.

422
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:50,809
Thank you.

423
00:24:51,288 --> 00:24:52,528
The credit belongs to all.

424
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:54,329
The victory in Rundu

425
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:56,649
depended on civilians and soldiers.

426
00:24:57,089 --> 00:24:58,062
With the help

427
00:24:58,062 --> 00:24:59,432
of Commander Xiao and General Yan,

428
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:00,968
we won.

429
00:25:01,528 --> 00:25:02,688
You're very humble.

430
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,328
Good!

431
00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:06,920
Minister Xiao.

432
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:09,089
You trained a good soldier.

433
00:25:14,488 --> 00:25:15,329
Thank you.

434
00:25:16,008 --> 00:25:17,929
I simply employed standard drills

435
00:25:17,968 --> 00:25:18,888
for military training.

436
00:25:19,688 --> 00:25:20,768
His achievements stem

437
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:22,849
from exceptional dedication.

438
00:25:23,528 --> 00:25:24,409
He has

439
00:25:24,448 --> 00:25:25,288
worked so hard.

440
00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:29,160
Attendant Wu'an,

441
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:30,528
I'm curious

442
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,208
about one thing.

443
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:34,169
Since you serve under Commander Xiao,

444
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:35,649
why didn't you impersonate him,

445
00:25:35,649 --> 00:25:37,129
a man you know better,

446
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:38,688
instead of General He?

447
00:25:39,528 --> 00:25:41,288
After all, General Fengyun

448
00:25:41,649 --> 00:25:42,528
is as famous as

449
00:25:42,528 --> 00:25:43,768
General Feihong.

450
00:25:49,768 --> 00:25:50,792
Your Majesty.

451
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,369
If I pretend to be General Fengyun,

452
00:25:54,768 --> 00:25:55,609
my face will

453
00:25:55,768 --> 00:25:57,089
immediately give me away.

454
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,208
But General Feihong

455
00:26:00,968 --> 00:26:02,889
always wore a mask in the past.

456
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:05,089
Few have seen his true appearance.

457
00:26:06,008 --> 00:26:07,144
Thus, impersonating him

458
00:26:07,288 --> 00:26:09,008
is naturally easier.

459
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:11,448
That's how I could

460
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,208
leverage General Feihong's reputation

461
00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:14,488
to intimidate the Wutuo.

462
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:16,048
That sounds reasonable.

463
00:26:17,089 --> 00:26:17,968
It seems

464
00:26:17,968 --> 00:26:18,889
I ignored details.

465
00:26:20,248 --> 00:26:21,128
Speaking of which,

466
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:22,968
you should thank General He.

467
00:26:29,048 --> 00:26:30,024
Your Majesty.

468
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:32,968
General He comes from a noble family.

469
00:26:33,129 --> 00:26:34,809
I don't dare to make a connection
with him.

470
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:38,089
Nevertheless, I must indeed

471
00:26:38,488 --> 00:26:40,849
express my gratitude to General He.

472
00:26:47,129 --> 00:26:48,248
Thank you, General He.

473
00:26:49,288 --> 00:26:50,609
I am

474
00:26:51,688 --> 00:26:53,208
very grateful to you.

475
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:06,856
Your Majesty.

476
00:27:07,488 --> 00:27:10,409
I hold General He in high esteem.

477
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:12,488
Now that I've finally met him

478
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:14,409
at this Mid-Autumn banquet,

479
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:17,369
I wish to spar

480
00:27:17,688 --> 00:27:18,889
with General He

481
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:21,048
to enliven the celebration for all.

482
00:27:21,528 --> 00:27:23,248
May Your Majesty grant my request.

483
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:32,409
Challenge General Feihong?

484
00:27:32,688 --> 00:27:34,089
He is so overconfident!

485
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:35,112
Exactly.

486
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:43,169
His Majesty just praised your humility,

487
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:44,728
and now you're getting cocky.

488
00:27:45,889 --> 00:27:47,488
A bad general

489
00:27:47,528 --> 00:27:48,728
makes a bad soldier.

490
00:27:49,928 --> 00:27:50,968
Mr. Yang,

491
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:52,488
that's a little judgmental.

492
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:55,288
To match General Feihong's prowess,

493
00:27:55,688 --> 00:27:57,208
I've practiced martial arts

494
00:27:57,369 --> 00:27:58,649
relentlessly.

495
00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:09,608
Your Majesty.

496
00:28:10,048 --> 00:28:11,008
This Mid-Autumn Festival

497
00:28:11,288 --> 00:28:13,129
is a time for peace and joy.

498
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:14,448
A fight game

499
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:16,488
seems inappropriate.

500
00:28:22,008 --> 00:28:23,112
General He.

501
00:28:23,592 --> 00:28:24,488
Attendant Wu'an

502
00:28:24,488 --> 00:28:25,768
is awaiting His Majesty's reply.

503
00:28:26,528 --> 00:28:27,768
Before His Majesty speaks,

504
00:28:28,649 --> 00:28:30,728
why did you rush to decline?

505
00:28:37,688 --> 00:28:38,728
Your Majesty.

506
00:28:40,488 --> 00:28:42,048
I think

507
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:44,649
General He made a fair point.

508
00:28:45,008 --> 00:28:47,929
A fight before Your Majesty

509
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:50,688
is indeed improper.

510
00:28:51,968 --> 00:28:53,288
It's just to add to the fun.

511
00:28:53,968 --> 00:28:54,929
When I

512
00:28:54,968 --> 00:28:55,968
was Crown Prince,

513
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:57,169
I often sparred

514
00:28:57,609 --> 00:28:58,889
with soldiers.

515
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:02,089
Both of you know what to do.

516
00:29:02,889 --> 00:29:04,569
Don't hurt each other.

517
00:29:04,968 --> 00:29:06,569
- As Your Majesty commands.
- As Your Majesty commands.

518
00:29:13,768 --> 00:29:14,856
Use this sword.

519
00:29:33,768 --> 00:29:34,688
The Qinglang Sword

520
00:29:34,688 --> 00:29:35,968
is General Feihong's sword.

521
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,248
Why is Attendant Wu'an

522
00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:39,929
holding it?

523
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:41,649
So strange.

524
00:29:42,288 --> 00:29:43,144
Attendant Wu'an.

525
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:45,089
Why hesitate?

526
00:29:45,569 --> 00:29:46,528
If you fear losing,

527
00:29:46,889 --> 00:29:48,809
surrender now.

528
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,248
Bring it on, General He.

529
00:30:26,849 --> 00:30:27,752
Incredible!

530
00:31:27,048 --> 00:31:28,369
General Feihong is defeated?

531
00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:30,048
How is this possible?

532
00:31:39,451 --> 00:31:40,744
It's so...

533
00:31:47,728 --> 00:31:48,728
Your Majesty.

534
00:31:48,728 --> 00:31:49,688
I'm done.

535
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,560
Impressive.

536
00:31:57,929 --> 00:31:58,984
He Rufei.

537
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,849
You wish me dead, right?

538
00:32:01,248 --> 00:32:02,288
I'll take your life

539
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:03,809
like a vengeful ghost.

540
00:32:05,728 --> 00:32:06,632
He Yan!

541
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,352
General He.

542
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:10,809
Stop shouting here.

543
00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:12,248
You can't stand to lose?

544
00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:17,089
Your Majesty, forgive me.

545
00:32:17,089 --> 00:32:18,248
That's not true.

546
00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:19,528
I...

547
00:32:19,528 --> 00:32:20,456
I...

548
00:32:25,048 --> 00:32:26,120
Your Majesty.

549
00:32:27,048 --> 00:32:28,208
People say

550
00:32:28,329 --> 00:32:29,609
martial artists

551
00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:31,129
are all proud.

552
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:34,089
General He's martial skills
are unmatched.

553
00:32:34,409 --> 00:32:36,488
If he hadn't been injured

554
00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:37,704
in the Huayuan Battle

555
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:39,929
or had recovered,

556
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:41,809
he never

557
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:43,649
would've lost.

558
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,728
General He is too young

559
00:32:47,129 --> 00:32:48,609
to accept this outcome.

560
00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:51,208
That's understandable.

561
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:52,409
Actually,

562
00:32:52,968 --> 00:32:54,809
this outcome

563
00:32:55,089 --> 00:32:56,448
means little.

564
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:59,889
So long as Your Majesty and officials

565
00:33:00,129 --> 00:33:01,488
find enjoyment,

566
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:05,208
it would be great.

567
00:33:07,929 --> 00:33:09,000
Attendant Wu'an.

568
00:33:09,569 --> 00:33:10,688
At such a young age,

569
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:12,528
you show remarkable courage and wisdom,

570
00:33:13,048 --> 00:33:13,968
making you

571
00:33:14,008 --> 00:33:15,609
a good soldier.

572
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:24,768
- Congratulations, Your Majesty,
- Congratulations, Your Majesty,

573
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,089
- on acquiring an exceptional soldier.
- on acquiring an exceptional soldier.

574
00:33:33,288 --> 00:33:37,728
The Empress came with noblewomen
to propose a toast.

575
00:33:47,003 --> 00:33:49,480
(Princess of Wei, Empress of Wei)

576
00:34:06,889 --> 00:34:08,329
- I wish Your Majesty
- I wish Father

577
00:34:08,648 --> 00:34:10,168
- happiness.
- happiness.

578
00:34:10,488 --> 00:34:13,008
- May Wei lasting peace!
- May Wei lasting peace!

579
00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:14,664
Rise.

580
00:34:15,249 --> 00:34:16,369
Thank you, Your Majesty.

581
00:34:28,488 --> 00:34:30,168
- We wish Your Majesty
- We wish Your Majesty

582
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:32,088
- happiness.
- happiness.

583
00:34:32,289 --> 00:34:35,128
- May Wei lasting peace!
- May Wei lasting peace!

584
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:45,809
Please sit.

585
00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:00,249
(She's a good female general.)

586
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:02,608
(I hear that even Mr. Chu)

587
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,608
(holds her in high regard.)

588
00:35:20,929 --> 00:35:21,928
Pingting.

589
00:35:22,608 --> 00:35:24,409
Mind your manners before His Majesty.

590
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:29,192
Your Majesty,

591
00:35:29,648 --> 00:35:30,849
I have something to report.

592
00:35:34,729 --> 00:35:35,608
Your Majesty,

593
00:35:35,608 --> 00:35:36,608
I bring charges against

594
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:37,849
He Yan of Yezhou Garrison.

595
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:44,729
She disguised as a man

596
00:35:44,929 --> 00:35:46,769
to join the army.
She's been deceiving you.

597
00:35:47,048 --> 00:35:48,289
Please punish her severely.

598
00:35:49,256 --> 00:35:50,289
What?

599
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:51,249
Disguised as a man?

600
00:35:53,409 --> 00:35:54,472
Is that true?

601
00:35:55,968 --> 00:35:57,608
What? He Yan is female?

602
00:35:58,689 --> 00:35:59,849
This is deception.

603
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:00,729
Exactly!

604
00:36:00,729 --> 00:36:02,648
This is deception!

605
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:03,912
Yes.

606
00:36:04,088 --> 00:36:05,008
How's this possible?

607
00:36:06,008 --> 00:36:06,888
Who knows?

608
00:36:07,168 --> 00:36:08,008
Impossible.

609
00:36:09,528 --> 00:36:10,528
It's a capital offense.

610
00:36:12,048 --> 00:36:13,088
It's insane.

611
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:15,848
Miss Xu,

612
00:36:16,769 --> 00:36:17,849
before His Majesty,

613
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:18,824
mind your words.

614
00:36:19,528 --> 00:36:20,392
Attendant Wu'an

615
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:22,048
couldn't possibly be female.

616
00:36:28,409 --> 00:36:29,256
Your Majesty,

617
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:31,289
a body check will confirm

618
00:36:31,528 --> 00:36:32,448
my honesty.

619
00:36:34,648 --> 00:36:35,769
I just don't know

620
00:36:36,249 --> 00:36:37,409
if she dares to do that.

621
00:36:39,249 --> 00:36:40,168
Good idea.

622
00:36:41,096 --> 00:36:41,968
Do a body check.

623
00:36:41,968 --> 00:36:42,856
- Yes.
- Yes.

624
00:36:44,809 --> 00:36:45,729
Minister Xiao.

625
00:36:45,729 --> 00:36:46,889
In your opinion,

626
00:36:47,088 --> 00:36:48,488
how should I handle this?

627
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,128
Your Majesty,

628
00:36:57,329 --> 00:36:58,312
I'm sorry

629
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:00,128
for bothering you.

630
00:37:09,488 --> 00:37:10,376
Actually,

631
00:37:11,088 --> 00:37:12,289
I've long been aware of this.

632
00:37:13,048 --> 00:37:14,056
What?

633
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:16,088
Your Majesty knew it?

634
00:37:16,648 --> 00:37:17,704
So, that's true.

635
00:37:22,856 --> 00:37:23,769
Yes.

636
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:24,840
Well...

637
00:37:25,689 --> 00:37:26,664
(When I was young,)

638
00:37:27,008 --> 00:37:28,008
I met a woman

639
00:37:28,209 --> 00:37:29,289
by chance.

640
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,304
To be honest,

641
00:37:31,648 --> 00:37:32,729
she has no talent

642
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:35,088
for martial arts.

643
00:37:36,528 --> 00:37:37,568
Back then, I thought

644
00:37:37,648 --> 00:37:39,088
she was rather foolishly persistent,

645
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,008
and she would give up

646
00:37:41,648 --> 00:37:42,968
after encountering some setbacks.

647
00:37:45,608 --> 00:37:46,528
But to my surprise,

648
00:37:47,608 --> 00:37:48,889
she persisted day after day

649
00:37:49,689 --> 00:37:51,409
and did it.

650
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:53,929
I've never seen

651
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:56,088
such unyielding determination in anyone.

652
00:37:57,048 --> 00:37:58,289
She is like a steadfast tree

653
00:37:59,689 --> 00:38:01,088
and as resilient as grass.

654
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:04,769
She commanded my attention.

655
00:38:07,128 --> 00:38:08,040
Actually,

656
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,409
back then,

657
00:38:09,409 --> 00:38:10,968
I didn't know how I felt about her.

658
00:38:11,488 --> 00:38:13,729
I was a little too harsh on her,

659
00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:16,209
giving her a strict teaching.

660
00:38:18,689 --> 00:38:19,624
I guess

661
00:38:19,968 --> 00:38:22,329
she must've hated me.

662
00:38:24,889 --> 00:38:25,769
Well,

663
00:38:27,048 --> 00:38:29,209
no wonder you remain solitary.

664
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:32,168
You frightened the girl away.

665
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:35,289
She didn't flee from my harshness.

666
00:38:36,168 --> 00:38:37,160
However,

667
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:38,568
misfortune struck her family.

668
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:41,224
From then on,

669
00:38:42,409 --> 00:38:43,769
we were separated by distance

670
00:38:45,168 --> 00:38:46,128
and out of touch.

671
00:38:49,729 --> 00:38:50,889
Surprisingly, we met again

672
00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:54,249
in Yezhou.

673
00:38:55,329 --> 00:38:56,409
She was in trouble

674
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,128
and helpless.

675
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:00,296
However,

676
00:39:01,576 --> 00:39:02,448
she

677
00:39:02,448 --> 00:39:03,568
remained indomitable

678
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:06,008
yet naive.

679
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,448
This reminded me vividly

680
00:39:10,088 --> 00:39:11,329
of our childhood friendship.

681
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:13,608
Childhood friendship?

682
00:39:15,008 --> 00:39:15,929
I don't think so.

683
00:39:17,128 --> 00:39:18,329
You finally realized

684
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:19,769
you had feelings

685
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:21,809
for that girl, right?

686
00:39:34,528 --> 00:39:35,528
You are right.

687
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:38,128
After our separation,

688
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:39,168
I came to realize

689
00:39:41,168 --> 00:39:42,409
that my feelings for her

690
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:46,008
couldn't be forgotten.

691
00:39:56,729 --> 00:39:57,640
Your Majesty.

692
00:39:57,968 --> 00:39:59,608
I admired her exceptional abilities

693
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:01,648
and didn't want to part with her.

694
00:40:03,448 --> 00:40:04,849
So, I let her disguise as a man

695
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:06,729
to stay at Yezhou Garrison.

696
00:40:08,929 --> 00:40:09,928
Your Majesty.

697
00:40:10,448 --> 00:40:11,849
I offer my two military merits

698
00:40:12,072 --> 00:40:13,008
to beg your forgiveness

699
00:40:13,008 --> 00:40:14,488
for my recklessness.

700
00:40:15,568 --> 00:40:16,648
I implore your approval.

701
00:40:26,249 --> 00:40:27,128
I granted the request

702
00:40:27,128 --> 00:40:28,528
of Commander Xiao.

703
00:40:29,008 --> 00:40:30,008
So, Attendant Wu'an

704
00:40:30,209 --> 00:40:31,528
commits no act of deception.

705
00:40:32,209 --> 00:40:33,168
Moreover,

706
00:40:33,168 --> 00:40:34,329
I'm moved

707
00:40:34,568 --> 00:40:36,209
by Commander Xiao's love.

708
00:40:36,729 --> 00:40:37,689
He is fully pardoned.

709
00:40:39,048 --> 00:40:41,088
- Your Majesty is wise.
- Your Majesty is wise.

710
00:40:46,048 --> 00:40:47,528
Your Majesty is merciful

711
00:40:47,968 --> 00:40:51,249
and forgives their deception.

712
00:40:51,689 --> 00:40:53,729
Yet General Fengyun,

713
00:40:54,008 --> 00:40:56,128
as military commander,

714
00:40:56,409 --> 00:40:58,729
deceived us all

715
00:40:58,809 --> 00:41:00,369
for personal reasons.

716
00:41:00,528 --> 00:41:03,209
It may

717
00:41:03,448 --> 00:41:04,929
disappoint the troops.

718
00:41:05,528 --> 00:41:07,008
That makes sense.

719
00:41:07,608 --> 00:41:08,448
If soldiers

720
00:41:08,448 --> 00:41:09,289
start following

721
00:41:09,289 --> 00:41:10,409
this example

722
00:41:11,409 --> 00:41:12,889
and hide women in camp,

723
00:41:13,769 --> 00:41:14,809
military order

724
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:15,729
will be ruined.
