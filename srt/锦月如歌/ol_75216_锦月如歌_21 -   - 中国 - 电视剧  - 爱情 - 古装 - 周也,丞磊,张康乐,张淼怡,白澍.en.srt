=Episode 21=

23
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:48,388
Here comes our female general!

24
00:01:48,388 --> 00:01:49,384
- Welcome.
- Come on.

25
00:01:49,384 --> 00:01:50,347
- Have a seat.
- Come on.

26
00:01:50,347 --> 00:01:51,187
Come on, sit.

27
00:01:51,268 --> 00:01:52,347
- Come on.
- Take a seat.

28
00:01:52,908 --> 00:01:54,668
- Alright, let's sit.
- Over here.

29
00:01:54,668 --> 00:01:55,508
Sit here.

30
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:56,628
Thank you.

31
00:01:57,227 --> 00:01:58,468
Now that I've seen you,

32
00:01:58,787 --> 00:02:00,508
I can boast to my friends.

33
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:01,707
I didn't know

34
00:02:01,908 --> 00:02:03,268
I had become so popular.

35
00:02:03,347 --> 00:02:04,468
This is nothing.

36
00:02:04,748 --> 00:02:05,867
People on the street

37
00:02:06,147 --> 00:02:07,507
will shower you with flowers.

38
00:02:07,947 --> 00:02:09,228
Nowadays in Jiyang,

39
00:02:09,707 --> 00:02:11,027
the one most admired

40
00:02:11,027 --> 00:02:12,027
is Her Highness,

41
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:13,188
and the second

42
00:02:13,268 --> 00:02:14,108
would be you.

43
00:02:14,108 --> 00:02:14,988
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

44
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:17,307
But Her Highness is above us,

45
00:02:17,427 --> 00:02:18,707
while you're among us,

46
00:02:18,707 --> 00:02:20,867
which makes us believe

47
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:23,228
that women can achieve greatness, too.

48
00:02:24,347 --> 00:02:25,187
You ladies

49
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,467
are no less capable than men.

50
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:28,068
You may not have fought

51
00:02:28,307 --> 00:02:30,348
on the frontline, but your deeds

52
00:02:30,587 --> 00:02:32,388
boosted our morale tremendously.

53
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:34,467
We simply did small things

54
00:02:34,508 --> 00:02:35,907
under the protection

55
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:38,187
of frontline warriors like you.

56
00:02:38,627 --> 00:02:39,587
It's nothing.

57
00:02:40,548 --> 00:02:42,228
No deed is too small.

58
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,508
Everyone has their strengths.

59
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,467
As long as we act with benevolence

60
00:02:45,627 --> 00:02:47,108
and righteousness,

61
00:02:47,388 --> 00:02:48,427
we all deserve respect.

62
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:49,907
Besides,

63
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:50,747
women enjoy

64
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:52,027
a higher status in Jiyang

65
00:02:52,348 --> 00:02:53,747
thanks to Her Highness.

66
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:54,948
You ladies must

67
00:02:54,988 --> 00:02:56,707
showcase your talents even more.

68
00:02:56,988 --> 00:02:57,828
You're right.

69
00:02:57,948 --> 00:02:59,467
I've always wanted

70
00:02:59,668 --> 00:03:01,068
to take the imperial exam.

71
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,068
But I never took the exam,

72
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:04,228
for fear of being judged.

73
00:03:04,587 --> 00:03:06,627
Next year, I'll give it a try

74
00:03:06,747 --> 00:03:07,867
to leave no regrets.

75
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:10,668
I wish you success in the exams.

76
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:12,867
A general and a scholar.

77
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:13,948
I admire you.

78
00:03:14,268 --> 00:03:15,108
Meanwhile, I only

79
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:16,187
want to do business.

80
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:19,147
Most look down on merchants,

81
00:03:19,668 --> 00:03:20,948
but merchants can

82
00:03:21,108 --> 00:03:21,948
sustain themselves.

83
00:03:25,388 --> 00:03:26,707
Exquisite embroidery.

84
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:30,307
That's Min'er's starting fund.

85
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:31,548
That's why she did her best.

86
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:32,788
Don't listen to her.

87
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:34,348
Miss Wang is getting married.

88
00:03:34,664 --> 00:03:36,427
We're making small items for her.

89
00:03:37,027 --> 00:03:37,867
However,

90
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:39,187
the groom's embroidered pouch

91
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,548
is hers to make.

92
00:03:41,147 --> 00:03:42,907
Every stitch carries her affection.

93
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,187
We mustn't do it for her.

94
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:46,707
Miss Yan,

95
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,027
I want to make a pouch too.

96
00:03:49,587 --> 00:03:50,707
Would you teach me?

97
00:03:51,828 --> 00:03:53,747
It's for General Fengyun, isn't it?

98
00:03:57,508 --> 00:03:58,828
Let's teach our general.

99
00:03:58,828 --> 00:04:00,508
- Yeah.
- Let's teach her.

100
00:04:00,788 --> 00:04:02,307
- Come on.
- Let me show you.

101
00:04:02,307 --> 00:04:04,508
Insert the needle from below upwards.

102
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,520
Like this.

103
00:04:30,668 --> 00:04:31,508
Done.

104
00:04:32,507 --> 00:04:33,627
Let's see.

105
00:04:34,588 --> 00:04:35,428
Let's see.

106
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,187
Needlework takes practice.

107
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:50,468
- Yeah.
- I can teach you

108
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:51,668
step by step.

109
00:04:51,947 --> 00:04:52,787
Yeah.

110
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:56,147
What about this?

111
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:01,907
Well...

112
00:05:01,907 --> 00:05:03,548
If it's not working,

113
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:05,028
we can try something else.

114
00:05:05,627 --> 00:05:07,307
How about cooking?

115
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:09,827
General Fengyun would be deeply moved

116
00:05:10,028 --> 00:05:11,627
if you cooked for him in person.

117
00:05:12,307 --> 00:05:13,187
But

118
00:05:13,548 --> 00:05:15,507
I've never cooked before.

119
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:18,187
I can't just make plain porridge.

120
00:05:20,427 --> 00:05:21,588
Make some plain noodles.

121
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:22,827
That's the easiest.

122
00:05:23,468 --> 00:05:24,507
Yeah, plain noodles.

123
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:25,668
We can teach you

124
00:05:25,788 --> 00:05:26,628
all the recipes.

125
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:27,827
Give it a try.

126
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:28,708
Yeah.

127
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:29,988
- You got this.
- You got this.

128
00:05:29,988 --> 00:05:30,908
- Try it.
- Come on.

129
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:31,907
Yeah.

130
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:43,508
Commander.

131
00:05:44,908 --> 00:05:46,187
You've been sorting out

132
00:05:46,307 --> 00:05:47,947
Jiyang's military affairs for days.

133
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:49,307
You must have been tired.

134
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:50,507
I can't starve you.

135
00:05:51,908 --> 00:05:52,748
Commander, look.

136
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:55,988
I made the noodles myself.

137
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:58,148
Commander, please do me a favor

138
00:05:58,788 --> 00:05:59,628
and try it.

139
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:01,107
Please.

140
00:06:02,307 --> 00:06:03,387
Why did you want to cook?

141
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:07,988
I just wanted to do something for you.

142
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:31,307
(How much salt did you put in this?)

143
00:06:33,947 --> 00:06:34,787
Commander.

144
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:35,628
Is it good?

145
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:39,628
Yeah.

146
00:06:41,387 --> 00:06:42,548
Seems like I have

147
00:06:42,587 --> 00:06:44,588
some talent in cooking, more or less.

148
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,187
Seeing you enjoy it so much,

149
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:05,548
I'm getting hungry.

150
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:06,988
Let me...

151
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:20,988
You were saying...?

152
00:07:21,627 --> 00:07:22,467
No...

153
00:07:25,468 --> 00:07:26,308
Nothing.

154
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:33,067
If you like it so much,

155
00:07:33,348 --> 00:07:34,668
I'll make more tomorrow.

156
00:08:08,228 --> 00:08:09,068
What's wrong?

157
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,427
I'm checking for holes.

158
00:08:11,747 --> 00:08:12,668
If there are any,

159
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,187
I can mend them.

160
00:08:19,307 --> 00:08:21,108
I don't think it's torn anywhere.

161
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:26,307
Commander, I'll head back.

162
00:08:26,387 --> 00:08:27,228
Rest early.

163
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:44,948
Commander.

164
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:47,027
Did you hear

165
00:08:47,747 --> 00:08:48,867
a tearing sound?

166
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:00,068
No.

167
00:09:00,988 --> 00:09:01,828
No?

168
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,228
How did my sleeve get torn?

169
00:09:21,988 --> 00:09:23,068
Yeah, it's torn.

170
00:09:23,348 --> 00:09:24,428
Hurry and take it off.

171
00:09:25,547 --> 00:09:26,507
Come on.

172
00:09:26,707 --> 00:09:27,547
What...?

173
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:28,708
Is it necessary?

174
00:09:29,147 --> 00:09:30,428
It's fine. Take it off.

175
00:09:30,428 --> 00:09:31,907
No need, seriously.

176
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:32,828
Take it off.

177
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:41,028
Do you think

178
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,048
he misunderstood something?

179
00:09:45,147 --> 00:09:46,308
Why is he so flustered?

180
00:09:58,907 --> 00:09:59,747
What's the rush?

181
00:10:00,147 --> 00:10:00,988
Is something wrong?

182
00:10:02,787 --> 00:10:03,627
Commander.

183
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:04,507
Chai Anxi woke up.

184
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:43,068
Mr. Chai.

185
00:10:43,787 --> 00:10:44,948
When Wutuo attacked Jiyang,

186
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:46,867
you could've fled amid the chaos,

187
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:48,547
yet you stayed,

188
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,027
showing a resolve to protect the people.

189
00:10:51,787 --> 00:10:52,627
But why

190
00:10:52,907 --> 00:10:54,108
did you betray my father

191
00:10:55,228 --> 00:10:56,068
and Wei?

192
00:10:58,147 --> 00:10:59,147
I didn't betray Wei.

193
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:02,068
I never betrayed Wei.

194
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,027
I didn't expect it.

195
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:09,507
I just wanted Xiao Zhongwu dead.

196
00:11:11,267 --> 00:11:12,907
I wanted him dead.

197
00:11:13,988 --> 00:11:15,507
My father treated you well.

198
00:11:17,188 --> 00:11:18,667
Why did you do that?

199
00:11:29,108 --> 00:11:30,747
Is there something we don't know?

200
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:31,948
Feel free to speak.

201
00:11:32,468 --> 00:11:35,028
We'll plead your case
before His Majesty.

202
00:11:35,787 --> 00:11:37,228
He treated me well?

203
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:40,708
That's because he felt guilty.

204
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,588
He killed my son.

205
00:11:45,828 --> 00:11:47,988
My son had just reached adulthood.

206
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:49,788
As far as I know,

207
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:50,948
your son

208
00:11:51,308 --> 00:11:52,468
died on the battlefield.

209
00:11:52,988 --> 00:11:54,988
As a soldier, you should know

210
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:56,267
that war is merciless.

211
00:11:57,188 --> 00:11:58,387
When soldiers march to war,

212
00:11:58,867 --> 00:12:00,507
they embrace death without regrets.

213
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:02,588
Why would you think

214
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:03,627
that General Xiao

215
00:12:03,627 --> 00:12:04,867
killed your son?

216
00:12:05,547 --> 00:12:07,708
If Xiao Zhongwu hadn't been warlike,

217
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:08,747
my son

218
00:12:08,747 --> 00:12:10,308
wouldn't have died.

219
00:12:10,547 --> 00:12:12,267
If he truly died in battle,

220
00:12:12,428 --> 00:12:13,268
as his father,

221
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:14,828
I'd be immensely proud.

222
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:16,188
But he died

223
00:12:16,267 --> 00:12:17,828
under Xiao Zhongwu's

224
00:12:17,828 --> 00:12:19,468
petty schemes.

225
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:26,988
You were supposed to

226
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,708
lead the vanguard at Yanshan.

227
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:30,588
Why was my son

228
00:12:30,588 --> 00:12:32,188
sent as the vanguard in the end?

229
00:12:32,948 --> 00:12:35,027
He never returned,

230
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:37,228
yet you built your fame.

231
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:42,468
You earned your glory by stepping

232
00:12:44,468 --> 00:12:46,308
on my son's corpse.

233
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:49,547
I remember that battle.

234
00:12:50,588 --> 00:12:51,907
A total of 216

235
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:54,468
Xiao Army soldiers

236
00:12:55,787 --> 00:12:57,027
died on the battlefield.

237
00:12:58,747 --> 00:12:59,787
Even though they knew

238
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:00,708
before setting out

239
00:13:01,387 --> 00:13:02,227
that this battle

240
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:04,348
would likely be fatal,

241
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:08,667
they still volunteered to fight.

242
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:11,867
Your son,

243
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:14,588
Captain Chai Qian,

244
00:13:15,988 --> 00:13:16,988
was one of them.

245
00:13:20,387 --> 00:13:21,227
Do you know

246
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:23,267
we encountered Wutuo cavalry

247
00:13:24,147 --> 00:13:25,667
on the way to Yanshan?

248
00:13:26,387 --> 00:13:27,468
With 1,000 soldiers,

249
00:13:27,468 --> 00:13:28,988
we fought against 5,000 enemies.

250
00:13:31,588 --> 00:13:33,308
I couldn't reach Yanshan in time.

251
00:13:34,507 --> 00:13:37,108
Your son volunteered

252
00:13:38,188 --> 00:13:41,348
to lead the remaining
215 Xiao Army troops

253
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:43,787
to Yanshan,

254
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:47,147
sacrificing themselves to turn the tide.

255
00:13:50,468 --> 00:13:52,468
You're lying.

256
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:56,588
Mr. Chai.

257
00:13:57,147 --> 00:13:58,228
As a deputy general,

258
00:13:59,627 --> 00:14:01,348
how could you distrust the commander

259
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,027
who had fought

260
00:14:03,068 --> 00:14:04,308
alongside you for years?

261
00:14:04,988 --> 00:14:06,027
And as a father,

262
00:14:06,907 --> 00:14:08,228
why did you underestimate

263
00:14:09,108 --> 00:14:10,988
the son you raised yourself?

264
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,828
Here is the petition

265
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:26,188
signed by

266
00:14:27,468 --> 00:14:28,907
all 216 Xiao Army soldiers.

267
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:52,680
(Petition)

268
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:06,228
Qian,

269
00:15:06,588 --> 00:15:08,348
you volunteered to fight?

270
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:13,387
I'm sorry.

271
00:15:14,027 --> 00:15:15,547
I'm so sorry.

272
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:19,027
I wronged General Xiao.

273
00:15:22,228 --> 00:15:24,547
I wronged all the soldiers

274
00:15:25,348 --> 00:15:27,387
of the Xiao Army.

275
00:15:38,267 --> 00:15:39,107
General Chai.

276
00:15:39,428 --> 00:15:40,507
You already regret it.

277
00:15:40,948 --> 00:15:42,348
Then tell us the truth.

278
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:45,188
In the Mingshui Battle,
the commander died,

279
00:15:45,588 --> 00:15:46,988
and 30,000 soldiers perished.

280
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,308
Was it fate

281
00:15:50,787 --> 00:15:51,747
or a setup?

282
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:55,348
Beware of He Rufei.

283
00:15:58,428 --> 00:16:01,428
He told me to hold back
General Xiao's plea for help

284
00:16:03,747 --> 00:16:05,108
for a few days.

285
00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:09,348
Beware of whom?

286
00:16:12,147 --> 00:16:13,108
He Rufei.

287
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,548
Mr. Chai.

288
00:16:16,907 --> 00:16:19,308
Was anyone else involved?

289
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,747
I only had contact with He Rufei.

290
00:16:23,628 --> 00:16:26,188
But I'm sure
someone in the capital was involved.

291
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:28,787
He sounded like

292
00:16:32,228 --> 00:16:34,507
someone highly influential.

293
00:16:41,308 --> 00:16:42,148
Who could be

294
00:16:42,348 --> 00:16:43,988
more influential than Xu Jingfu

295
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:46,907
in the court?

296
00:17:25,107 --> 00:17:25,947
Congratulations

297
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:27,188
(Li Kuang, Eight Warriors of Fuyue Army)
on being entitled General Feihong.

298
00:17:41,388 --> 00:17:42,908
He Rufei.

299
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:44,988
It's you.

300
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:46,428
In the Mingshui Battle,

301
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,628
you made me hold back

302
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,628
General Xiao's plea for help,

303
00:17:51,107 --> 00:17:52,708
killing General Xiao

304
00:17:53,428 --> 00:17:55,908
and 30,000 Xiao Army soldiers.

305
00:17:56,388 --> 00:17:58,468
No, I'm not He Rufei.

306
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,027
You're not He Rufei?

307
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:40,868
Are you He Yan

308
00:18:40,908 --> 00:18:42,347
or He Rufei?

309
00:18:52,388 --> 00:18:54,027
(Beware of He Rufei.)

310
00:18:56,027 --> 00:18:57,307
(He made me hold back)

311
00:18:57,347 --> 00:18:58,988
(General Xiao's plea for help)

312
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:02,708
(for a few days.)

313
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:11,188
(The "He Rufei" Chai Anxi mentioned)

314
00:19:12,188 --> 00:19:13,587
(should be me.)

315
00:19:15,148 --> 00:19:16,148
(But I never)

316
00:19:16,148 --> 00:19:17,228
(saw him in private.)

317
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:19,827
(The one who contacted him)

318
00:19:20,428 --> 00:19:21,988
(must have been the real He Rufei.)

319
00:19:23,468 --> 00:19:24,308
(Therefore,)

320
00:19:24,787 --> 00:19:25,708
(He Rufei must have)

321
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,388
(colluded with Xu Jingfu long ago.)

322
00:19:28,747 --> 00:19:30,747
(But why did he
scheme against the Xiao Army?)

323
00:19:31,908 --> 00:19:32,748
(Was my death)

324
00:19:33,388 --> 00:19:35,388
(also part of the scheme?)

325
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:48,868
(No wonder Xiao Jue)

326
00:19:48,908 --> 00:19:50,148
(took the Qinglang Sword)

327
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:52,307
(and was quite)

328
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:54,107
(defensive against me)

329
00:19:54,148 --> 00:19:55,027
(at Yezhou Garrison,)

330
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:56,388
(suspecting)

331
00:19:56,388 --> 00:19:57,668
(that I was a spy.)

332
00:19:59,267 --> 00:20:00,428
(But he didn't know)

333
00:20:01,587 --> 00:20:02,908
(that the He Rufei he knew)

334
00:20:03,388 --> 00:20:05,067
(was not the He Rufei)

335
00:20:05,948 --> 00:20:07,347
(who contacted Chai Anxi.)

336
00:20:13,468 --> 00:20:14,308
(Anyway,)

337
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,067
(I must uncover the truth.)

338
00:20:16,668 --> 00:20:17,587
(Huaijin deserves)

339
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:19,948
(an explanation.)

340
00:20:40,228 --> 00:20:41,468
Young Master, you're back.

341
00:20:42,787 --> 00:20:43,988
What did Chai Anxi say?

342
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:46,948
Is Chancellor Xu
involved in the Mingshui defeat?

343
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,708
Since you've obtained an answer,

344
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:56,747
I'll kill Chai Anxi now

345
00:20:57,347 --> 00:20:58,428
to complete the mission.

346
00:20:59,107 --> 00:20:59,947
No.

347
00:21:00,787 --> 00:21:01,908
He can't die yet.

348
00:21:03,908 --> 00:21:04,748
Where's Xiao Jue?

349
00:21:05,428 --> 00:21:06,429
Went to see Her Highness.

350
00:21:09,787 --> 00:21:10,627
In that case,

351
00:21:11,507 --> 00:21:12,908
we should bid her farewell.

352
00:21:16,827 --> 00:21:19,868
I didn't expect
that you're also leaving Jiyang.

353
00:21:20,307 --> 00:21:21,628
Unfortunately,

354
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:23,428
we're going different ways.

355
00:21:24,307 --> 00:21:25,468
We're bound to meet

356
00:21:26,347 --> 00:21:27,668
in the imperial court again.

357
00:21:30,107 --> 00:21:31,107
Commander's right.

358
00:21:45,188 --> 00:21:46,067
Why did you

359
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:47,948
ask to speak in private,

360
00:21:48,948 --> 00:21:50,067
even without He Yan?

361
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:56,628
I need

362
00:21:57,228 --> 00:21:59,587
your help with something.

363
00:22:00,228 --> 00:22:01,068
What is it?

364
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:02,107
He Yan

365
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:03,948
joined my ranks

366
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:04,908
disguised as a man.

367
00:22:05,347 --> 00:22:06,267
You know best

368
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,547
what restrictions women face.

369
00:22:09,388 --> 00:22:10,628
He Yan is patriotic

370
00:22:11,507 --> 00:22:12,668
and has military prowess.

371
00:22:13,587 --> 00:22:15,027
But her true identity

372
00:22:15,027 --> 00:22:16,428
brings unnecessary complications.

373
00:22:16,908 --> 00:22:17,748
Therefore,

374
00:22:18,228 --> 00:22:19,628
she disguised herself as a man

375
00:22:20,027 --> 00:22:20,908
to serve in the army.

376
00:22:21,668 --> 00:22:22,632
We do need to

377
00:22:23,107 --> 00:22:24,468
address this issue.

378
00:22:25,307 --> 00:22:26,347
But it's not time yet.

379
00:22:27,107 --> 00:22:28,267
So please help

380
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:30,708
keep her secret.

381
00:22:31,388 --> 00:22:32,747
General Fengyun, rest assured.

382
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:34,547
You saved Jiyang.

383
00:22:34,868 --> 00:22:35,708
We Jiyang people

384
00:22:35,948 --> 00:22:38,267
won't let our saviors face any trouble.

385
00:22:41,148 --> 00:22:41,988
Thank you.

386
00:22:45,027 --> 00:22:45,867
Xiao Jue.

387
00:22:50,388 --> 00:22:52,267
He Yan is Buwang's only disciple.

388
00:22:52,948 --> 00:22:54,787
Though jade needs grinding to glow,

389
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:56,347
I won't allow

390
00:22:56,827 --> 00:22:58,547
any man to bully or hurt her.

391
00:22:59,747 --> 00:23:02,428
Jiyang will always be her maiden home.

392
00:23:33,868 --> 00:23:34,708
Don't worry.

393
00:23:34,868 --> 00:23:35,787
I'll keep your secret

394
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:38,188
even after I go back to the capital.

395
00:23:38,747 --> 00:23:39,587
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

396
00:23:39,948 --> 00:23:41,067
What a pity that you can't

397
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:42,507
take credit for this.

398
00:23:43,948 --> 00:23:44,948
As long as Jiyang's safe.

399
00:23:45,908 --> 00:23:46,748
Mr. Chu.

400
00:23:47,428 --> 00:23:48,268
Let's stop here.

401
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:50,307
I was in the army.

402
00:23:50,628 --> 00:23:51,948
Night walks don't scare me.

403
00:23:53,428 --> 00:23:54,268
Actually,

404
00:23:54,628 --> 00:23:56,148
I just wanted to walk with you.

405
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:01,468
You still call me "Mr. Chu."

406
00:24:02,027 --> 00:24:03,948
That eases my mind.

407
00:24:04,988 --> 00:24:06,668
I didn't know that Commander Xiao would

408
00:24:07,307 --> 00:24:08,228
suspect my master.

409
00:24:09,787 --> 00:24:10,627
By the way,

410
00:24:10,827 --> 00:24:11,827
Yingxiang is holding

411
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,507
the mermaid-silk gown you gave me.

412
00:24:14,507 --> 00:24:16,307
She will take it to your room.

413
00:24:17,188 --> 00:24:18,028
Thank you.

414
00:24:18,668 --> 00:24:19,508
Mr. Chu.

415
00:24:19,827 --> 00:24:21,628
As Xu Jingfu's prized disciple,

416
00:24:22,388 --> 00:24:23,628
you must know

417
00:24:23,908 --> 00:24:25,388
more than you claim

418
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:26,668
about his dealings.

419
00:24:27,547 --> 00:24:28,747
The real question is

420
00:24:29,188 --> 00:24:30,787
how involved you were.

421
00:24:31,787 --> 00:24:34,787
But you stood with Jiyang in crisis.

422
00:24:35,148 --> 00:24:35,988
I believe

423
00:24:36,228 --> 00:24:38,468
that you would never commit treason.

424
00:24:39,267 --> 00:24:41,148
I hope you'll stop working

425
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:42,827
for the villain.

426
00:24:46,468 --> 00:24:47,628
Master is a loyal man.

427
00:24:48,507 --> 00:24:49,388
How can I believe

428
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:51,067
that he'd frame patriots

429
00:24:51,188 --> 00:24:52,148
for no reason?

430
00:24:52,547 --> 00:24:54,148
But Chai Anxi's detailed account

431
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,027
sowed doubts in me...

432
00:24:59,388 --> 00:25:00,228
Never mind.

433
00:25:00,587 --> 00:25:02,507
No matter what lies ahead,

434
00:25:03,228 --> 00:25:05,547
I seek only to act
without regret or guilt.

435
00:25:06,587 --> 00:25:07,547
Then I wish you

436
00:25:08,628 --> 00:25:09,468
a safe journey.

437
00:25:11,787 --> 00:25:12,627
Miss He,

438
00:25:12,908 --> 00:25:14,507
you truly stand apart from other women.

439
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,187
They

440
00:25:16,747 --> 00:25:17,868
lack your resilience.

441
00:25:19,347 --> 00:25:20,307
What they desire

442
00:25:20,747 --> 00:25:21,747
is merely to find a match

443
00:25:21,747 --> 00:25:23,468
for marital bliss and peaceful living.

444
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:25,587
Mr. Chu, your words

445
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:27,027
sound rather condescending.

446
00:25:27,388 --> 00:25:28,267
How come?

447
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,708
Men can study literature,

448
00:25:30,908 --> 00:25:31,988
join the military,

449
00:25:32,468 --> 00:25:33,868
or become physicians and merchants.

450
00:25:34,428 --> 00:25:35,747
Yet from birth,

451
00:25:36,307 --> 00:25:38,468
women are expected
to be virtuous and demure,

452
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:40,148
learn needlework and etiquette,

453
00:25:40,267 --> 00:25:42,027
all for marital servitude
and child-rearing.

454
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,547
Whether they want it matters not.

455
00:25:44,827 --> 00:25:45,668
Because all this

456
00:25:46,148 --> 00:25:47,507
is deemed natural and rightful.

457
00:25:50,067 --> 00:25:51,107
I was small-minded.

458
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:52,988
Miss He,

459
00:25:53,267 --> 00:25:54,107
as a woman,

460
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:55,988
you empathize

461
00:25:56,107 --> 00:25:56,988
with women's plight.

462
00:25:57,468 --> 00:25:58,787
You dare to pioneer paths

463
00:25:59,228 --> 00:26:00,307
others dare not tread.

464
00:26:00,908 --> 00:26:02,267
I truly admire you.

465
00:26:02,747 --> 00:26:04,948
You find me different

466
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:07,027
because I've studied,

467
00:26:07,507 --> 00:26:08,547
ventured out,

468
00:26:08,948 --> 00:26:11,228
and even defied conventions
by joining the military,

469
00:26:11,347 --> 00:26:12,948
as others might call it.

470
00:26:13,468 --> 00:26:14,547
Yet how many women

471
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,988
share my experiences?

472
00:26:18,347 --> 00:26:19,547
If they too

473
00:26:19,948 --> 00:26:20,868
could witness

474
00:26:21,468 --> 00:26:22,988
Yezhou's snows,

475
00:26:23,827 --> 00:26:25,307
Jiyang's waters,

476
00:26:25,908 --> 00:26:27,468
desert moons,

477
00:26:27,948 --> 00:26:29,468
and mountain ranges,

478
00:26:31,148 --> 00:26:31,988
tell me,

479
00:26:32,228 --> 00:26:33,628
would they still tolerate

480
00:26:33,868 --> 00:26:36,067
being confined to petty
domestic squabbles?

481
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:38,027
Would they still wallow in melancholy

482
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:39,547
and self-pity?

483
00:26:45,027 --> 00:26:46,267
I wish to blaze

484
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:48,747
a different trail for you.

485
00:26:52,507 --> 00:26:53,388
What do you think

486
00:26:54,188 --> 00:26:55,028
of this proposal?

487
00:27:00,188 --> 00:27:01,028
I need no one

488
00:27:01,307 --> 00:27:02,147
to blaze a trail

489
00:27:02,468 --> 00:27:03,948
on my behalf.

490
00:27:04,868 --> 00:27:05,787
What I truly desire

491
00:27:06,347 --> 00:27:07,708
is someone who'll walk beside me

492
00:27:08,107 --> 00:27:09,148
to blaze a trail together.

493
00:27:22,067 --> 00:27:23,027
Then who do you think

494
00:27:23,868 --> 00:27:24,708
could

495
00:27:25,668 --> 00:27:27,027
blaze a trail with you?

496
00:27:28,267 --> 00:27:29,107
Could it be

497
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:30,387
Commander Xiao?

498
00:27:40,428 --> 00:27:41,268
Commander.

499
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:43,988
You came back alone

500
00:27:45,547 --> 00:27:46,908
just to bid him farewell?

501
00:27:57,547 --> 00:27:58,387
Commander.

502
00:27:59,507 --> 00:28:00,347
Chai Anxi

503
00:28:00,988 --> 00:28:01,828
is dead.

504
00:28:32,787 --> 00:28:34,587
We maintained
complete perimeter security

505
00:28:34,988 --> 00:28:35,988
without lapse.

506
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:37,347
After nightfall,

507
00:28:37,448 --> 00:28:39,067
some cleaners passed through

508
00:28:39,668 --> 00:28:40,628
and suddenly attacked.

509
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:42,988
We fought fiercely

510
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:44,948
but failed to stop them.

511
00:28:47,628 --> 00:28:48,468
Commander.

512
00:28:48,587 --> 00:28:49,507
I've failed my duty.

513
00:28:49,787 --> 00:28:50,668
Please punish me.

514
00:28:55,787 --> 00:28:56,627
You did your best.

515
00:28:57,468 --> 00:28:58,747
Cheng Lisu and Song Taotao

516
00:28:59,188 --> 00:29:00,468
must be treating the injured.

517
00:29:01,307 --> 00:29:02,307
Seek their medical aid.

518
00:29:03,148 --> 00:29:03,988
Understood.

519
00:29:39,787 --> 00:29:41,228
Commander, look.

520
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:44,948
This token bears Wutuo's lion emblem.

521
00:29:46,027 --> 00:29:46,867
These assassins

522
00:29:47,307 --> 00:29:48,668
could be Wutuo soldiers.

523
00:29:52,988 --> 00:29:54,027
Wutuo soldiers?

524
00:29:55,908 --> 00:29:57,708
Haven't they retreated after the defeat?

525
00:29:59,188 --> 00:30:00,028
Mr. Chu,

526
00:30:01,027 --> 00:30:02,628
you don't know anything about it?

527
00:30:02,948 --> 00:30:03,788
Commander Xiao.

528
00:30:03,988 --> 00:30:04,908
What do you mean?

529
00:30:05,827 --> 00:30:06,667
Haven't I been

530
00:30:07,107 --> 00:30:08,587
with you the whole time?

531
00:30:20,787 --> 00:30:22,948
Chu Zhao is Xu Jingfu's prized disciple.

532
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:24,787
Are you suspecting him?

533
00:30:25,307 --> 00:30:27,107
The role he has played in this

534
00:30:27,747 --> 00:30:28,628
remains unclear.

535
00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:31,428
But mobilizing Wutuo troops

536
00:30:32,267 --> 00:30:33,827
is beyond his current capabilities.

537
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:36,508
Commander.

538
00:30:37,827 --> 00:30:38,667
Come in.

539
00:30:42,388 --> 00:30:43,228
Commander.

540
00:30:43,388 --> 00:30:44,228
I'm back.

541
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:45,747
Commander.

542
00:30:45,747 --> 00:30:46,908
I've been thinking.

543
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:48,468
We can't just let it slide.

544
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,428
Shall we rush

545
00:30:50,827 --> 00:30:52,347
to the capital to confront Xu Jingfu?

546
00:30:53,428 --> 00:30:54,468
How can we confront him

547
00:30:54,868 --> 00:30:55,708
without

548
00:30:56,307 --> 00:30:57,188
our key witness?

549
00:30:58,228 --> 00:30:59,068
But

550
00:30:59,428 --> 00:31:00,787
we have some other leads.

551
00:31:02,148 --> 00:31:03,388
At least, we've confirmed

552
00:31:04,267 --> 00:31:05,148
that He Rufei

553
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:07,307
was indeed involved.

554
00:31:08,228 --> 00:31:09,628
Xu Jingfu is a cunning old fox.

555
00:31:10,267 --> 00:31:11,107
Then let's

556
00:31:11,628 --> 00:31:13,027
look into He Rufei.

557
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:14,948
Find out how those two

558
00:31:15,547 --> 00:31:16,387
were connected

559
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:17,508
before Mingshui.

560
00:31:17,587 --> 00:31:18,427
Understood.

561
00:31:18,747 --> 00:31:19,587
No wonder Mr. Cheng

562
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:20,468
keeps calling

563
00:31:20,468 --> 00:31:21,668
He Rufei ungrateful.

564
00:31:22,187 --> 00:31:23,867
General Xiao treated him so well

565
00:31:24,188 --> 00:31:25,747
and gifted him the Qinglang Sword.

566
00:31:26,787 --> 00:31:27,627
But in the end,

567
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:28,868
he betrayed us.

568
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:39,587
Anything else?

569
00:31:40,347 --> 00:31:41,187
If not,

570
00:31:41,868 --> 00:31:42,708
I'll take my leave.

571
00:31:55,228 --> 00:31:56,068
Young Master.

572
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,267
Who sent those assassins?

573
00:32:00,107 --> 00:32:00,988
Master, naturally.

574
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:03,347
I delayed taking action.

575
00:32:03,668 --> 00:32:04,988
Master ran out of patience

576
00:32:04,988 --> 00:32:06,027
and sent assassins.

577
00:32:06,988 --> 00:32:07,948
All I had to do

578
00:32:08,388 --> 00:32:10,307
was to stay out of it.

579
00:32:10,868 --> 00:32:12,148
So I went to see Her Highness

580
00:32:12,267 --> 00:32:13,428
to establish an alibi.

581
00:32:18,948 --> 00:32:20,347
(But the truth must also surface.)

582
00:32:21,067 --> 00:32:22,307
So I left behind evidence

583
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,188
to guide Xiao Jue.

584
00:32:24,267 --> 00:32:25,267
Just like that,

585
00:32:25,668 --> 00:32:27,428
Xiao Jue will suspect Chancellor Xu.

586
00:32:27,787 --> 00:32:29,188
But he is in the capital.

587
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,827
Wouldn't Xiao Jue suspect

588
00:32:32,228 --> 00:32:34,388
that you did it
on behalf of the Chancellor?

589
00:32:34,428 --> 00:32:35,268
No, he wouldn't.

590
00:32:36,148 --> 00:32:37,507
Xiao Jue knows full well

591
00:32:37,988 --> 00:32:40,307
that Master would never
hand me evidence of colluding

592
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,587
with Wutuo people.

593
00:32:42,188 --> 00:32:43,388
So, I couldn't possibly

594
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:44,388
mobilize Wutuo troops.

595
00:32:44,908 --> 00:32:46,587
Even without Chai Anxi's testimony,

596
00:32:47,428 --> 00:32:48,868
Xiao Jue will find other means

597
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:50,308
to fight Master

598
00:32:50,988 --> 00:32:52,228
and He Rufei to the end.

599
00:32:53,027 --> 00:32:54,388
A pity indeed for Chai Anxi,

600
00:32:55,067 --> 00:32:56,307
once a valiant warrior,

601
00:32:56,868 --> 00:32:58,027
now brought to such an end.

602
00:32:58,988 --> 00:32:59,828
Young Master.

603
00:33:00,027 --> 00:33:01,747
Chai Anxi was killed by Wutuo soldiers.

604
00:33:02,908 --> 00:33:04,347
Will Chancellor Xu blame you

605
00:33:04,587 --> 00:33:05,868
for failing his orders?

606
00:33:06,547 --> 00:33:09,347
Gain and loss must balance.
Only thus endures.

607
00:33:10,267 --> 00:33:11,507
Had I followed his orders,

608
00:33:12,107 --> 00:33:13,468
we'd miss the secrets.

609
00:33:14,468 --> 00:33:15,308
These secrets

610
00:33:15,908 --> 00:33:17,507
and Sun Xiangfu's ledger

611
00:33:18,587 --> 00:33:20,148
prove that Master has betrayed Wei.

612
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,728
(Cui Mansion)

613
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:29,507
Commander Xiao, Miss He.

614
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:31,428
Mr. Cheng, Miss Song.

615
00:33:31,948 --> 00:33:32,908
Take care.

616
00:33:33,908 --> 00:33:34,748
I don't know

617
00:33:34,988 --> 00:33:35,908
when we'll meet again.

618
00:33:36,507 --> 00:33:38,507
You repelled the Wutuo army

619
00:33:38,787 --> 00:33:39,787
and saved us.

620
00:33:40,468 --> 00:33:41,308
We appreciate it.

621
00:33:41,308 --> 00:33:43,976
(Great Virtue)

622
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:54,748
Yan.

623
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,868
We'll pass through Chonghuai.

624
00:33:57,027 --> 00:33:58,107
Shall we make a stop

625
00:33:58,188 --> 00:33:59,468
and have fun for a few days?

626
00:34:02,555 --> 00:34:04,968
(Wangjiang House)

627
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:08,948
Passing through Chonghuai,

628
00:34:09,388 --> 00:34:10,868
I finally get to see

629
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,428
the renowned Wangjiang House.

630
00:34:12,868 --> 00:34:13,708
Did you bring

631
00:34:13,828 --> 00:34:14,748
enough money?

632
00:34:15,227 --> 00:34:16,388
You wanted to come.

633
00:34:16,468 --> 00:34:17,507
So, you're paying.

634
00:34:18,227 --> 00:34:20,268
I suggested this trip to lift spirits

635
00:34:20,748 --> 00:34:22,187
because Mr. He seemed troubled.

636
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:23,268
Once He cheers up,

637
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:24,507
Huaijin

638
00:34:24,587 --> 00:34:25,507
will be happy too.

639
00:34:29,707 --> 00:34:31,147
This place looks pricey.

640
00:34:31,788 --> 00:34:32,707
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

641
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:33,907
No problem.

642
00:34:34,347 --> 00:34:35,187
Besides,

643
00:34:35,187 --> 00:34:36,227
we can all chip in

644
00:34:36,428 --> 00:34:37,428
if my money runs short.

645
00:34:37,788 --> 00:34:39,468
Just like back at Ruyun House.

646
00:34:39,707 --> 00:34:40,788
Right, Huaijin?

647
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:42,468
Leave me out of this.

648
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:45,187
The famous Ruyun House in the capital?

649
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,637
Why did you visit

650
00:34:46,637 --> 00:34:47,627
without me?

651
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,147
Why would we take you?

652
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,027
You were just a kid.

653
00:34:50,147 --> 00:34:51,227
How old were you?

654
00:34:52,388 --> 00:34:53,228
(Guys,)

655
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:55,428
have you heard of Ruyun House?

656
00:34:56,468 --> 00:34:58,147
Yaojing's biggest brothel.

657
00:34:58,507 --> 00:34:59,347
I've been there.

658
00:34:59,428 --> 00:35:00,268
It's overrated.

659
00:35:01,347 --> 00:35:03,707
Young Master Yan is so experienced.

660
00:35:04,308 --> 00:35:05,148
Of course.

661
00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:09,864
You've been there?

662
00:35:11,147 --> 00:35:11,987
No.

663
00:35:12,587 --> 00:35:13,427
I lied.

664
00:35:15,027 --> 00:35:15,867
Huaijin.

665
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:16,828
You woke up?

666
00:35:17,547 --> 00:35:18,507
I heard Ruyun House

667
00:35:18,547 --> 00:35:19,667
has a new songstress

668
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:20,948
named Hua Youxian.

669
00:35:21,507 --> 00:35:22,908
Her stunning look

670
00:35:23,107 --> 00:35:24,348
and heavenly voice

671
00:35:24,868 --> 00:35:26,547
made her the top performer in a month.

672
00:35:26,988 --> 00:35:27,948
Let's go hear her sing

673
00:35:28,268 --> 00:35:29,268
after class.

674
00:35:29,468 --> 00:35:30,388
Do you dare?

675
00:35:31,147 --> 00:35:32,468
It's your turn now.

676
00:35:32,627 --> 00:35:33,507
Tell you what...

677
00:35:34,107 --> 00:35:34,947
Forget about Yan He.

678
00:35:35,348 --> 00:35:36,268
He will brag about it

679
00:35:36,388 --> 00:35:37,228
either way.

680
00:35:37,507 --> 00:35:38,347
Let's go.

681
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:40,067
Only cowards back out.

682
00:35:41,027 --> 00:35:42,187
He Rufei, you hear me?

683
00:35:44,748 --> 00:35:45,588
Me too?

684
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,067
Let's go.

685
00:35:47,387 --> 00:35:48,227
With the top student

686
00:35:48,227 --> 00:35:49,187
Xiao Huaijin with us,

687
00:35:49,428 --> 00:35:50,988
we won't be punished too harshly

688
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:52,388
even if we get caught.

689
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:53,867
Let's go.

690
00:35:54,908 --> 00:35:55,788
Let's go.

691
00:35:55,908 --> 00:35:56,748
Come on.

692
00:35:57,107 --> 00:35:58,187
How do we sneak out?

693
00:35:58,868 --> 00:35:59,708
He Rufei.

694
00:36:00,468 --> 00:36:01,308
Keep up.

695
00:36:01,348 --> 00:36:02,188
Don't be a coward.

696
00:36:08,587 --> 00:36:09,428
Climb over here.

697
00:36:14,348 --> 00:36:15,188
Careful.

698
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,227
- Thanks.
- Let's go.

699
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:19,308
Someone's missing.

700
00:36:20,227 --> 00:36:21,067
Where's He Rufei?

701
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:22,908
I'm here.

702
00:36:29,428 --> 00:36:30,707
Pathetic.

703
00:36:45,428 --> 00:36:46,507
Thank you.

704
00:36:47,147 --> 00:36:47,988
You can't even

705
00:36:48,388 --> 00:36:49,228
climb the wall?

706
00:36:49,828 --> 00:36:50,908
I didn't want to come.

707
00:36:51,547 --> 00:36:52,387
Yan He

708
00:36:52,428 --> 00:36:53,547
dragged me along.

709
00:36:55,948 --> 00:36:56,788
Also,

710
00:36:56,988 --> 00:36:58,627
aren't you, the top student,

711
00:36:59,107 --> 00:37:00,667
also sneaking off to the brothel?

712
00:37:05,027 --> 00:37:05,867
What's wrong?

713
00:37:10,067 --> 00:37:10,948
Ruyun House

714
00:37:11,707 --> 00:37:13,027
has long intrigued me.

715
00:37:14,388 --> 00:37:15,228
Yan.

716
00:37:16,308 --> 00:37:17,667
You don't look well.

717
00:37:17,788 --> 00:37:19,147
Didn't you sleep well?

718
00:37:20,627 --> 00:37:21,467
It's fine.

719
00:37:21,828 --> 00:37:23,988
It's just some memories resurfacing.

720
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:26,187
Is it about Mr. Liu?

721
00:37:27,268 --> 00:37:29,067
I-I'll stop.

722
00:37:35,308 --> 00:37:36,908
Ruyun House is fascinating.

723
00:37:37,428 --> 00:37:38,268
Huaijin.

724
00:37:38,388 --> 00:37:39,587
Remember our old friends?

725
00:37:49,403 --> 00:37:53,768
(Wangjiang House)

726
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:09,668
Cheng Lisu.

727
00:38:10,468 --> 00:38:11,587
This is...?

728
00:38:11,908 --> 00:38:12,748
Huaijin.

729
00:38:12,868 --> 00:38:14,187
You remember Yang Mingzhi?

730
00:38:16,347 --> 00:38:18,696
(Yang Mingzhi, Magistrate of Chonghuai)

731
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:23,468
I'm Yang Mingzhi.

732
00:38:24,107 --> 00:38:25,187
Greetings, General Fengyun.

733
00:38:33,748 --> 00:38:35,948
Mingzhi now serves
as Chonghuai's Magistrate.

734
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:37,428
We were classmates.

735
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:39,348
So I invited him here to catch up.

736
00:38:45,147 --> 00:38:46,988
Are they enemies or something?

737
00:38:48,147 --> 00:38:50,107
Back at Xianchang Academy,

738
00:38:50,507 --> 00:38:51,988
they were close friends.

739
00:38:52,468 --> 00:38:53,308
Yang Mingzhi

740
00:38:53,308 --> 00:38:55,268
is the only son
of the current Minister of War.

741
00:38:55,828 --> 00:38:57,308
He passed the exams years ago,

742
00:38:57,548 --> 00:38:58,388
yet somehow ended up

743
00:38:58,388 --> 00:39:00,027
as a lowly magistrate in Chonghuai.

744
00:39:00,707 --> 00:39:01,587
Why are they acting

745
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:02,788
like strangers now?

746
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:04,067
I'm also curious.

747
00:39:06,227 --> 00:39:07,067
Gentlemen,

748
00:39:07,268 --> 00:39:08,428
fate brought us together

749
00:39:08,587 --> 00:39:09,468
at the academy.

750
00:39:09,587 --> 00:39:11,268
Cleared up your misunderstandings.

751
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:12,108
Cheng Lisu,

752
00:39:12,468 --> 00:39:13,308
you may not know.

753
00:39:15,027 --> 00:39:16,507
There is no misunderstanding

754
00:39:17,627 --> 00:39:18,667
between us.

755
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:25,268
Huaijin.

756
00:39:25,868 --> 00:39:26,708
Rest assured.

757
00:39:27,707 --> 00:39:28,868
I'll convince my father

758
00:39:28,948 --> 00:39:30,428
to plead for General Xiao

759
00:39:30,988 --> 00:39:32,027
and urge His Majesty

760
00:39:32,027 --> 00:39:33,067
to find out the truth.

761
00:39:34,507 --> 00:39:35,828
As the Minister of War,

762
00:39:36,468 --> 00:39:37,388
my father

763
00:39:37,828 --> 00:39:39,388
has certain influence.

764
00:39:40,348 --> 00:39:41,188
Mingzhi.

765
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:43,588
Thank you.

766
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:46,388
Xiao Zhongwu, as the commander-in-chief,

767
00:39:46,788 --> 00:39:47,828
was reckless,

768
00:39:48,227 --> 00:39:50,147
leading our troops into an ambush.

769
00:39:50,428 --> 00:39:51,507
He was too proud

770
00:39:52,027 --> 00:39:53,388
to seek prompt rescue,

771
00:39:53,948 --> 00:39:56,667
which caused huge casualties.

772
00:39:57,067 --> 00:39:57,907
Xiao Zhongwu

773
00:39:57,948 --> 00:39:59,468
is a sinner to Wei.

774
00:40:00,124 --> 00:40:02,428
(Xiao Mansion)

775
00:40:02,428 --> 00:40:03,268
Huaijin.

776
00:40:03,948 --> 00:40:04,868
I broke my promise.

777
00:40:06,268 --> 00:40:07,108
Sorry.

778
00:40:09,428 --> 00:40:11,147
I forced this burden on you.

779
00:40:12,227 --> 00:40:13,308
No need to apologize.

780
00:40:14,828 --> 00:40:16,908
I heard you volunteered
to go to Que City.

781
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:21,348
Word travels fast, it seems.

782
00:40:21,748 --> 00:40:22,588
Are you insane?

783
00:40:25,868 --> 00:40:27,988
I know you want to
restore honor to your father

784
00:40:27,988 --> 00:40:28,868
and the Xiao Army.

785
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,988
But it's too risky.

786
00:40:33,187 --> 00:40:34,388
I've made up my mind.

787
00:40:35,176 --> 00:40:36,627
Don't try to dissuade me.

788
00:40:38,988 --> 00:40:39,828
Huaijin.

789
00:40:42,587 --> 00:40:43,587
Have you ever thought

790
00:40:44,707 --> 00:40:45,547
that perhaps

791
00:40:46,187 --> 00:40:47,988
there's no hidden truth?

792
00:40:49,707 --> 00:40:51,948
Maybe General Xiao...

793
00:40:57,308 --> 00:40:58,388
Yang Mingzhi.

794
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:00,507
From now on,

795
00:41:01,748 --> 00:41:03,227
stay out of my sight.

796
00:41:05,244 --> 00:41:10,760
(Xiao Mansion)

797
00:41:16,468 --> 00:41:17,308
Yeah.

798
00:41:17,507 --> 00:41:18,347
No misunderstandings.

799
00:41:19,107 --> 00:41:19,947
In the end,

800
00:41:20,827 --> 00:41:21,667
I'm nothing

801
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:23,187
