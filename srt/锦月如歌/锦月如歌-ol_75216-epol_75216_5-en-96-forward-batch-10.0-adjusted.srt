=Legend of The Female General=

22
00:01:51,832 --> 00:01:53,080
They're crossing the line,

23
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,000
putting loaches in my shoes.

24
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:01,880
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,808
It was an accident.

26
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,912
These candies got dirty.

27
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:12,239
Put them back.

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,199
Don't eat those.

29
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,176
Should I buy you new ones?

30
00:02:21,176 --> 00:02:22,079
No need. Go to class.

31
00:02:30,087 --> 00:02:33,048
=Episode 5=

32
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,400
You dug so much
into his past, but to no avail?

33
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,439
That's right.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,960
Everything matches his military records.

35
00:02:42,008 --> 00:02:44,840
Maybe He Yan really has nothing to do
with He Rufei and Xu Jingfu.

36
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,520
This only proves

37
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:50,000
those covering for him
are remarkably capable.

38
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:51,992
Covering for him?

39
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:53,880
Commander, have you
discovered something?

40
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,560
An unexpected lead.

41
00:02:58,519 --> 00:02:59,919
Have people keep looking.

42
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,759
Yes.

43
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,439
And what's going on
with the delay in provisions?

44
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,000
Yezhou Magistrate Sun Xiangfu

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,336
claims the harvest is poor,

46
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,000
the farmers are owed payments,

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,040
and the grain reserves
are critically low.

48
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,759
So he can't spare us any grain.

49
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:18,815
Absolute nonsense.

50
00:03:19,295 --> 00:03:20,614
It's not like there were

51
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:22,255
any natural disasters.

52
00:03:27,815 --> 00:03:28,815
There were none.

53
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:30,654
But man-made troubles exist.

54
00:03:31,214 --> 00:03:33,214
I bet Xu Jingfu told him to oppose you.

55
00:03:37,975 --> 00:03:39,975
Xu Jingfu got me transferred to Yezhou,

56
00:03:40,472 --> 00:03:41,654
away from the capital,

57
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,295
without any chance to turn the tide.

58
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:45,815
He never imagined

59
00:03:46,295 --> 00:03:48,734
that you had already chosen
to bide your time here.

60
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:49,944
But now that

61
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:51,416
you've trained these misfits

62
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,856
into capable soldiers,

63
00:03:52,975 --> 00:03:53,815
he's rushing

64
00:03:54,454 --> 00:03:55,734
to tamper with our provisions.

65
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,215
That's right.

66
00:03:58,095 --> 00:03:59,295
The new recruits lack cohesion.

67
00:04:00,135 --> 00:04:01,336
If provisions run short

68
00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:03,128
in times of good harvests

69
00:04:03,734 --> 00:04:05,894
and rumors of embezzlement surface,

70
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:07,375
the new recruits will

71
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:09,734
lose their trust in me.

72
00:04:10,575 --> 00:04:11,575
What should we do?

73
00:04:12,214 --> 00:04:14,334
The remaining provisions
can last a bit longer.

74
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:19,576
After the contest of capturing flags,
I'll visit Sun Xiangfu in person

75
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:21,734
and find out

76
00:04:22,734 --> 00:04:24,535
what kind of pawn

77
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:26,935
Xu Jingfu had planted in Yezhou.

78
00:04:43,774 --> 00:04:44,614
(He Yan,)

79
00:04:45,815 --> 00:04:46,854
(those closest to you)

80
00:04:47,774 --> 00:04:48,614
(despised you,)

81
00:04:49,015 --> 00:04:49,855
(abandoned you,)

82
00:04:50,214 --> 00:04:51,054
(and killed you.)

83
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:54,695
(Since you've come back
with a new identity,)

84
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:56,575
(from now on,)

85
00:04:57,334 --> 00:04:58,175
(your life)

86
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:00,854
(will be solely in your hands.)

87
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:23,174
Mr. He.

88
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:25,720
Your lanterns are hideous.

89
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,495
What matters is the sincerity.

90
00:05:33,495 --> 00:05:34,335
Mr. Cheng.

91
00:05:34,615 --> 00:05:35,495
Isn't your lantern

92
00:05:36,015 --> 00:05:36,974
way too huge?

93
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:38,575
This lantern

94
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:40,894
is not just for my ancestors.

95
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:42,854
It's also for Huaijin.

96
00:05:43,254 --> 00:05:45,055
So I made it bigger than usual.

97
00:05:45,735 --> 00:05:46,935
With both families together,

98
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:48,054
it's livelier

99
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:49,134
and less lonely.

100
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:51,015
My grand-aunt

101
00:05:51,414 --> 00:05:52,414
feared loneliness most.

102
00:05:53,974 --> 00:05:54,894
Madam Xiao

103
00:05:55,854 --> 00:05:56,894
also passed away?

104
00:05:57,695 --> 00:05:58,535
Yeah.

105
00:05:58,974 --> 00:06:00,934
She and my great-uncle
were a loving couple.

106
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:03,175
After my great-uncle died,

107
00:06:03,735 --> 00:06:04,894
my great-aunt was devastated.

108
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:06,415
After Huaijin

109
00:06:06,654 --> 00:06:08,575
escorted my great-uncle's coffin home,

110
00:06:09,175 --> 00:06:10,135
she took her own life.

111
00:06:17,974 --> 00:06:19,294
Huaijin is also quite lonely.

112
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,215
My family,

113
00:06:21,575 --> 00:06:22,415
including my mother,

114
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:24,494
and friends acquainted
with the Xiao family

115
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:26,015
don't really like him.

116
00:06:27,295 --> 00:06:28,975
They prefer my eldest uncle,

117
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,534
Huaijin's older brother,

118
00:06:30,774 --> 00:06:31,614
Xiao Jing.

119
00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:33,656
Why?

120
00:06:33,656 --> 00:06:35,512
Aren't they both members
of The Xiao family?

121
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,375
The Xiao family comes from
a long military lineage.

122
00:06:39,128 --> 00:06:40,495
One child must join the army.

123
00:06:41,094 --> 00:06:42,815
Xiao Jing is more of a scholar

124
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:44,367
than a military man.

125
00:06:44,887 --> 00:06:46,048
So Huaijin joined the army

126
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:47,608
for his elder brother

127
00:06:47,928 --> 00:06:49,127
and the entire family.

128
00:06:51,168 --> 00:06:53,888
He left at an early age
and rarely visited home.

129
00:06:54,608 --> 00:06:56,088
So, he's become quite aloof.

130
00:06:56,327 --> 00:06:58,567
He's distant even with his own family,

131
00:06:58,567 --> 00:06:59,687
let alone relatives like us.

132
00:07:00,408 --> 00:07:01,248
Even his mother

133
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:03,048
doesn't feel bonded with him.

134
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:05,047
Makes sense.

135
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:08,248
They're like strangers
after years apart.

136
00:07:08,848 --> 00:07:10,367
It leads to prejudice.

137
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:18,680
Mr. He, it's late.

138
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,688
I should head back.

139
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:21,007
Rest early.

140
00:08:02,408 --> 00:08:03,408
In times of hardship,

141
00:08:03,728 --> 00:08:05,304
take a piece of candy.

142
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:07,247
Let its sweetness

143
00:08:07,247 --> 00:08:08,127
comfort you.

144
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:10,048
Such little sweetness

145
00:08:10,048 --> 00:08:11,928
can attenuate the bitterness of life.

146
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:44,376
Premium Osmanthus wine.

147
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:47,607
I hear noblewomen
in the capital adore this.

148
00:08:59,544 --> 00:09:00,967
May the deceased

149
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:02,008
witness my devotion

150
00:09:02,048 --> 00:09:03,408
in folding these lanterns

151
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:05,288
and bless my wishes.

152
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:09,967
Disturbing the deceased

153
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:12,536
doesn't make you ashamed at all.

154
00:09:13,008 --> 00:09:13,848
Leave mortal affairs

155
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:16,056
to be handled by the living.

156
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:21,967
How do you know

157
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:23,447
I'm not speaking

158
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:24,760
the wishes of the deceased?

159
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:26,767
The regrets of the dead

160
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,487
must be redeemed by the living.

161
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,807
This is my promise to them.

162
00:09:36,087 --> 00:09:36,927
Want to fold some?

163
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:40,216
I'll share some with you

164
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,487
to repay you for saving me back then.

165
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,008
No need.

166
00:09:54,087 --> 00:09:55,160
This one

167
00:09:55,687 --> 00:09:57,687
carries blessings
to those heroes who died

168
00:09:57,687 --> 00:09:59,408
defending our land and people,

169
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:00,687
and their loved ones.

170
00:10:02,487 --> 00:10:03,967
Though I don't know your names,

171
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:05,727
these blessings

172
00:10:05,727 --> 00:10:07,248
come from my heart.

173
00:10:09,327 --> 00:10:10,167
Not bad.

174
00:10:11,607 --> 00:10:12,648
Hideous.

175
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,967
This is called free-form one.

176
00:10:18,207 --> 00:10:19,047
Perhaps

177
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,607
the heroes prefer it this way.

178
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:28,648
You mock my lanterns,

179
00:10:28,648 --> 00:10:29,768
but you won't make one.

180
00:10:30,008 --> 00:10:31,567
All talk, no action.

181
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:32,768
So picky.

182
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:54,807
What's the fuss?

183
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:57,128
I touched your hand, so what?

184
00:10:58,888 --> 00:11:01,128

I wonder if the deceased

223
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,934
shares this moonlight

224
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,295
with us, the living?

225
00:13:58,334 --> 00:13:59,174
Yes, they do.

226
00:14:34,552 --> 00:14:35,854
New recruits, listen up!

227
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,495
Red flags are placed

228
00:14:37,974 --> 00:14:39,672
throughout Mount Baiyue.

229
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:41,096
There are 15 in total.

230
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:42,760
This competition

231
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,816
lasts until sunset.

232
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:47,055
The team returning
with the most red flags

233
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,255
shall be the winner.

234
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:51,615
Remember. Don't cross the mountains.

235
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:53,255
Don't take lives.

236
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:54,534
Violators will face

237
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:55,655
military discipline.

238
00:14:55,974 --> 00:14:56,814
- Yes.
- Yes.

239
00:14:58,214 --> 00:14:59,295
After the competition,

240
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:01,175
the most outstanding recruit

241
00:15:01,495 --> 00:15:03,574
will join the Nine Banners Battalion.

242
00:15:04,135 --> 00:15:05,454
- Really?
- Really?

243
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,414
Soldiers!

244
00:15:09,015 --> 00:15:09,855
Set out.

245
00:15:10,854 --> 00:15:11,694
- Yes.
- Yes.

246
00:15:20,312 --> 00:15:21,854
This is the map of Mount Baiyue?

247
00:15:22,415 --> 00:15:23,255
Where did you get it?

248
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:27,814
I memorized the paths while patrolling

249
00:15:27,814 --> 00:15:29,624
and drew this map after I came back.

250
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:32,535
You memorized the paths

251
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:34,328
while being chased by wolves?

252
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:35,608
I checked the routes

253
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:36,655
while fleeing,

254
00:15:36,655 --> 00:15:38,040
and then reviewed them later.

255
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,095
So I know this place well.

256
00:15:40,056 --> 00:15:41,415
Trust your boss.

257
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,855
Those flags

258
00:15:45,255 --> 00:15:47,375
are usually placed in visible areas

259
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,015
near foothills and water sources.

260
00:15:49,695 --> 00:15:51,574
So the nearest flag

261
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:53,400
should be

262
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,974
on this open mountainside.

263
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,080
Come on, let's go for it.

264
00:15:57,814 --> 00:15:58,654
No.

265
00:15:58,734 --> 00:15:59,934
We're not going there.

266
00:16:01,112 --> 00:16:02,328
Those flags in the open

267
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,248
are easy targets.

268
00:16:04,248 --> 00:16:05,895
Many teams will notice them.

269
00:16:06,574 --> 00:16:07,672
If we go there,

270
00:16:08,094 --> 00:16:09,375
we'll be caught in chaos.

271
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:11,174
So,

272
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:14,614
we'll head

273
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:16,414
here.

274
00:16:16,903 --> 00:16:18,303
It's among dense woods,

275
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:20,102
behind a cliff.

276
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,342
It will be a challenge.

277
00:16:23,102 --> 00:16:24,783
Classic carrot-and-stick tactic.

278
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:27,503
They lure us with rewards
and then slap us down.

279
00:16:28,102 --> 00:16:29,582
Of course, it's challenging.

280
00:16:30,102 --> 00:16:31,023
Or they can just hold

281
00:16:31,383 --> 00:16:32,543
a martial arts contest.

282
00:16:34,582 --> 00:16:35,422
Let's go.

283
00:16:36,903 --> 00:16:38,903
Cliffs on Mount Baiyue are dangerous.

284
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:40,222
I doubt anyone

285
00:16:40,702 --> 00:16:42,783
can take this flag.

286
00:16:44,582 --> 00:16:45,702
New recruits can't.

287
00:16:46,702 --> 00:16:47,663
But veterans might

288
00:16:48,543 --> 00:16:50,822
have realized the purpose of the patrol

289
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,183
and completed a thorough mapping.

290
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:57,302
Do we have

291
00:16:57,742 --> 00:16:58,742
such a talent here?

292
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:01,383
Yeah.

293
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:05,223
He Yan.

294
00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:45,783
It's in such a precarious position.

295
00:17:45,783 --> 00:17:47,463
Only you could get that flag, He.

296
00:17:48,143 --> 00:17:48,983
Piece of cake.

297
00:18:02,462 --> 00:18:04,142
He, you're amazing.

298
00:18:06,982 --> 00:18:07,943
With only one patrol,

299
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:09,262
He Yan

300
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:11,263
has learned Mount Baiyue by heart.

301
00:18:11,702 --> 00:18:13,103
Impressive new talent.

302
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,183
But I bet on Lei Hou's team.

303
00:18:16,823 --> 00:18:17,702
Everyone

304
00:18:18,302 --> 00:18:20,742
in that team is a top martial artist.

305
00:18:21,943 --> 00:18:23,583
It takes teamwork to capture flags,

306
00:18:24,343 --> 00:18:25,383
not individual heroism.

307
00:18:26,302 --> 00:18:27,742
Therefore, deployment matters

308
00:18:28,623 --> 00:18:29,742
more than muscle.

309
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:31,663
So I still bet on

310
00:18:32,183 --> 00:18:33,023
He Yan.

311
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,502
H-Hand over your flags.

312
00:18:37,702 --> 00:18:39,343
(The members of He Yan's team are)

313
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:40,462
(of mixed quality,)

314
00:18:41,183 --> 00:18:42,392
(but each has talents.)

315
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,663
(If he can harness their talents)

316
00:18:44,982 --> 00:18:45,823
(through deployment,)

317
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,983
(they should)

318
00:18:47,262 --> 00:18:48,502
(make quite a team.)

319
00:18:48,903 --> 00:18:49,743
Take action.

320
00:18:53,063 --> 00:18:53,903
Do you surrender?

321
00:18:53,903 --> 00:18:54,743
Y-Yeah.

322
00:18:55,183 --> 00:18:57,262
W-Where are your flags?

323
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:11,622
Commander.

324
00:19:11,823 --> 00:19:13,583
He Yan's team
set up ambushes and snatched

325
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,223
many flags from the other teams.

326
00:19:15,623 --> 00:19:16,463
"Hold the ground,"

327
00:19:17,183 --> 00:19:18,222
"stay fresh, and strike"

328
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:20,863
"when the enemy is weak."

329
00:19:22,742 --> 00:19:23,903
Those new recruits

330
00:19:24,943 --> 00:19:26,423
are being thoroughly outplayed.

331
00:19:41,302 --> 00:19:42,142
What a surprise.

332
00:19:42,462 --> 00:19:43,800
You also captured seven flags.

333
00:19:44,423 --> 00:19:45,982
That's impressive.

334
00:19:46,982 --> 00:19:47,863
You flatter me.

335
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,062
Now we each hold seven flags.

336
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,728
Whoever claims
the last one in the valley

337
00:19:52,982 --> 00:19:53,943
becomes the winner.

338
00:19:54,623 --> 00:19:55,982
That terrain is treacherous.

339
00:19:56,383 --> 00:19:57,742
Why don't you retreat

340
00:19:58,222 --> 00:19:59,863
with your team to secure second place?

341
00:20:02,143 --> 00:20:02,983
That may be good,

342
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:05,823
but I crave first place.

343
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:09,062
Very well. We'll meet in the valley.

344
00:20:38,462 --> 00:20:40,262
Mr. Lei, this isn't much fun.

345
00:20:40,663 --> 00:20:42,502
Why don't we spice things up?

346
00:20:44,103 --> 00:20:44,943
I'm listening.

347
00:20:45,302 --> 00:20:46,142
What do you want?

348
00:20:46,823 --> 00:20:47,663
A duel.

349
00:20:48,062 --> 00:20:48,902
The loser

350
00:20:49,103 --> 00:20:50,583
surrenders all his flags.

351
00:20:52,262 --> 00:20:53,863
Those guys? Are they up to it?

352
00:20:53,863 --> 00:20:54,823
No way, He.

353
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:57,022
We worked so hard for these.

354
00:20:58,702 --> 00:21:00,382
It's okay, don't worry.

355
00:21:01,502 --> 00:21:02,542
If we come to duels,

356
00:21:03,383 --> 00:21:04,542
I won't hold back.

357
00:21:05,022 --> 00:21:06,982
You may lose even second place.

358
00:21:08,903 --> 00:21:09,823
I don't like fighting.

359
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:12,663
But no one can take what I desire

360
00:21:13,262 --> 00:21:14,343
from me.

361
00:21:15,262 --> 00:21:16,102
Therefore,

362
00:21:16,383 --> 00:21:17,462
I'll have to beat you.

363
00:22:01,383 --> 00:22:02,663
He Yan trusts us with his back.

364
00:22:03,062 --> 00:22:05,103
Naturally, we'll eliminate all threats.

365
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:06,502
You agreed to duel.

366
00:22:06,943 --> 00:22:08,222
But you resorted to tricks?

367
00:22:08,943 --> 00:22:10,542
E-Even bandits...

368
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:12,183
Bandits keep their word better.

369
00:22:28,823 --> 00:22:30,343
(Odd moves.)

370
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,048
- Nice!
- Well done!

371
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:56,782
Remarkable, Mr. He.

372
00:22:57,262 --> 00:22:58,143
I concede.

373
00:22:59,823 --> 00:23:00,742
You honor me.

374
00:23:02,103 --> 00:23:02,943
Commander.

375
00:23:03,502 --> 00:23:05,623
He Yan has claimed all 15 flags.

376
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:07,262
His team has returned.

377
00:23:08,143 --> 00:23:08,983
You've lost.

378
00:23:09,336 --> 00:23:10,302
Commander,

379
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:12,982
you're a great chess player
and talent scout.

380
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:14,983
I humbly

381
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:16,423
admit defeat.

382
00:23:18,782 --> 00:23:20,982
(If she were truly a planted spy here,)

383
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:23,223
(she wouldn't eagerly draw my attention)

384
00:23:23,383 --> 00:23:25,079
(by flaunting this conquest.)

385
00:23:26,343 --> 00:23:27,895
(But she is no ordinary recruit.)

386
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:31,262
(He Yan, what's your intention?)

387
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:32,983
Commander.

388
00:23:33,183 --> 00:23:34,222
The contest concludes.

389
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:36,143
Shall we proceed with rewards?

390
00:23:39,143 --> 00:23:39,983
No rush.

391
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:44,383
The Mid-Autumn Festival is
in five days. Wait until then.

392
00:23:46,022 --> 00:23:48,542
Have you decided the one to be

393
00:23:49,343 --> 00:23:51,222
enrolled in the Nine Banners Battalion?

394
00:24:18,022 --> 00:24:19,982
We took first place.

395
00:24:19,982 --> 00:24:21,592
But there's no celebration?

396
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:23,102
This is lame.

397
00:24:23,702 --> 00:24:24,903
There will be a feast.

398
00:24:24,903 --> 00:24:25,912
It's just postponed.

399
00:24:26,302 --> 00:24:27,142
Rest assured.

400
00:24:27,262 --> 00:24:28,383
You'll get your banquet.

401
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:30,943
Don't mock me.

402
00:24:30,943 --> 00:24:32,696
Aren't you craving meat?

403
00:24:33,143 --> 00:24:34,360
- Of course, we are.
- Of course, we are.

404
00:24:36,623 --> 00:24:37,463
He,

405
00:24:37,903 --> 00:24:38,743
after you join

406
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:40,583
the Nine Banners Battalion,

407
00:24:41,343 --> 00:24:42,222
don't forget us.

408
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:45,183
Never would I.

409
00:24:51,183 --> 00:24:52,863
(Let me ask Xiao Jue about this.)

410
00:24:58,583 --> 00:24:59,423
Morning, Master.

411
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:05,423
Master.

412
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:07,062
I lived up to your expectations

413
00:25:07,062 --> 00:25:09,368
and won first place in the competition.

414
00:25:09,368 --> 00:25:10,742
Thanks to your guidance,

415
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,782
I can join the Nine Banners Battalion.

416
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,312
(Great Master and Talented Disciple)
This is a flower basket I made.

417
00:25:16,423 --> 00:25:17,583
These 15 flags

418
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,143
represent my newly earned honors.

419
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,183
Please accept it

420
00:25:20,183 --> 00:25:22,143
as a token of gratitude.

421
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:26,302
"Talented disciple"?

422
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:29,816
You really know
how to toot your own horn.

423
00:25:29,816 --> 00:25:31,943
How am I tooting my own horn?

424
00:25:32,462 --> 00:25:34,702
Look, it says "Great Master" right here.

425
00:25:35,542 --> 00:25:36,382
With our bond,

426
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:38,104
once I join the battalion,

427
00:25:38,104 --> 00:25:39,102
I'll surely

428
00:25:39,222 --> 00:25:40,152
stand by you

429
00:25:40,152 --> 00:25:41,102
through thick and thin

430
00:25:41,102 --> 00:25:42,143
forever.

431
00:25:44,262 --> 00:25:45,302
So eloquent.

432
00:25:45,302 --> 00:25:47,143
It's a pity you're not teaching literacy

433
00:25:47,143 --> 00:25:48,623
to the troops.

434
00:25:48,623 --> 00:25:49,463
Master,

435
00:25:50,103 --> 00:25:52,062
how can you value my silver tongue

436
00:25:52,062 --> 00:25:53,302
over my true capabilities?

437
00:25:53,623 --> 00:25:54,776
With abilities like mine,

438
00:25:54,776 --> 00:25:56,120
I'll become your right-hand man

439
00:25:56,262 --> 00:25:58,663
once I join the Nine Banners Battalion.

440
00:26:13,742 --> 00:26:14,582
Are you really

441
00:26:15,982 --> 00:26:17,383
so eager to join the battalion?

442
00:26:17,903 --> 00:26:18,743
Of course.

443
00:26:18,943 --> 00:26:20,024
I'm a real talent.

444
00:26:20,024 --> 00:26:22,040
It would be your loss if I didn't join

445
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,542
the Nine Banners Battalion.

446
00:26:24,623 --> 00:26:26,022
I won't let you

447
00:26:26,022 --> 00:26:27,103
suffer such a great loss

448
00:26:27,103 --> 00:26:28,423
in your life, Commander.

449
00:26:34,863 --> 00:26:35,703
Commander.

450
00:26:36,022 --> 00:26:37,663
All instructors are waiting for you

451
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:38,702
at the main tent.

452
00:26:42,622 --> 00:26:44,183
Military affairs take priority.

453
00:26:44,183 --> 00:26:45,023
Go ahead.

454
00:26:45,023 --> 00:26:46,623
We can talk anytime.

455
00:26:48,103 --> 00:26:48,943
Wait.

456
00:26:51,302 --> 00:26:53,142
Take the pastries from the table.

457
00:27:02,262 --> 00:27:03,102
Thank you, Commander.

458
00:27:06,631 --> 00:27:09,976
(General Feihong's Mansion)

459
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:11,382
General.

460
00:27:11,903 --> 00:27:12,743
There is

461
00:27:13,022 --> 00:27:14,302
no conflict of interest

462
00:27:14,302 --> 00:27:15,142
between us.

463
00:27:15,782 --> 00:27:17,912
Wouldn't it be nice if we both

464
00:27:17,912 --> 00:27:18,903
served the Master?

465
00:27:22,103 --> 00:27:22,982
He wasn't

466
00:27:23,383 --> 00:27:24,742
avoiding you that day.

467
00:27:25,262 --> 00:27:27,263
He's just been burdened with worries

468
00:27:27,623 --> 00:27:29,183
and has become short-tempered.

469
00:27:29,943 --> 00:27:30,903
I wonder what troubles

470
00:27:31,423 --> 00:27:32,623
the Chancellor.

471
00:27:41,423 --> 00:27:42,302
It's Xiao Jue.

472
00:27:42,982 --> 00:27:44,543
He's causing trouble even in Yezhou.

473
00:27:44,543 --> 00:27:46,903
He is drawing attention
with the training

474
00:27:46,903 --> 00:27:48,343
and making outrageous demands

475
00:27:48,343 --> 00:27:50,143
to Yezhou Magistrate Sun Xiangfu

476
00:27:50,143 --> 00:27:51,183
for provisions and funds.

477
00:27:51,823 --> 00:27:53,742
Sun Xiangfu is running short on those,

478
00:27:53,742 --> 00:27:55,183
but Xiao Jue refuses to back down.

479
00:27:55,183 --> 00:27:57,343
They're at an impasse.

480
00:27:58,302 --> 00:27:59,583
As the Chancellor's disciple,

481
00:28:00,383 --> 00:28:02,102
I'm obligated to go to Yezhou Garrison

482
00:28:02,502 --> 00:28:03,462
for mediation.

483
00:28:04,062 --> 00:28:04,902
It's just that

484
00:28:05,262 --> 00:28:07,262
I've never been there.

485
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:10,222
Besides, I'm merely a scholar.

486
00:28:10,742 --> 00:28:11,782
Unlike you,

487
00:28:12,702 --> 00:28:14,103
who commands numerous talents,

488
00:28:14,742 --> 00:28:17,423
I only have one maid working for me.

489
00:28:24,863 --> 00:28:27,022
My guard here knows some martial arts.

490
00:28:27,502 --> 00:28:29,302
Once you arrive in Yezhou,

491
00:28:29,302 --> 00:28:30,742
you can ask him to run your errands

492
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:32,143
if you need anything.

493
00:28:36,222 --> 00:28:37,623
That would be most helpful.

494
00:28:38,982 --> 00:28:39,822
But

495
00:28:40,502 --> 00:28:41,423
I can't travel fast.

496
00:28:41,982 --> 00:28:43,183
Perhaps, I'll meet

497
00:28:43,782 --> 00:28:44,622
your guard in Yezhou

498
00:28:44,982 --> 00:28:47,608
so as not to make Magistrate Sun wait.

499
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:51,102
Alright.

500
00:28:52,888 --> 00:28:55,128
Then I'll take my leave.

501
00:29:08,062 --> 00:29:09,222
Once you reach Yezhou,

502
00:29:09,222 --> 00:29:10,742
go straight to Sun Xiangfu

503
00:29:10,742 --> 00:29:11,623
for cooperation.

504
00:29:20,423 --> 00:29:21,432
General,

505
00:29:21,432 --> 00:29:22,382
won't you

506
00:29:23,143 --> 00:29:24,062
be implicated?

507
00:29:24,502 --> 00:29:25,342
What's the problem?

508
00:29:25,342 --> 00:29:27,863
Yezhou is Sun Xiangfu's territory.

509
00:29:27,863 --> 00:29:29,080
Even if things go south,

510
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,352
Sun Xiangfu is to blame
for his incompetence.

511
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,583
What does it have to do with me?

512
00:29:35,782 --> 00:29:36,622
Chu Zhao wants

513
00:29:36,782 --> 00:29:38,103
to claim credit from Chancellor.

514
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:40,982
We can't let him steal the spotlight.

515
00:29:41,982 --> 00:29:42,822
So, Ding Yi,

516
00:29:43,222 --> 00:29:44,856
make sure you succeed.

517
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,143
No mistakes are allowed.

518
00:29:47,982 --> 00:29:48,822
Yes.

519
00:29:54,183 --> 00:29:58,040
(Chu Mansion)

520
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,542
(Late Mother, Chu Mingfang)

521
00:29:59,542 --> 00:30:00,382
Mother,

522
00:30:01,823 --> 00:30:03,022
I'm going to Yezhou.

523
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:05,624
I won't be able to speak

524
00:30:06,103 --> 00:30:07,302
with you for a while.

525
00:30:21,623 --> 00:30:22,463
Young Master.

526
00:30:22,782 --> 00:30:24,663
He Rufei envies
that you're valued by Mr. Xu

527
00:30:25,302 --> 00:30:26,982
and is eager to impress Mr. Xu.

528
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,262
If his men reach Yezhou,

529
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:30,840
they might ruin everything.

530
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:32,423
You're mistaken.

531
00:30:33,062 --> 00:30:33,902
They'll help us.

532
00:30:34,623 --> 00:30:36,183
He Rufei's guard is

533
00:30:36,183 --> 00:30:37,023
as skilled as you

534
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:38,623
in martial arts.

535
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:40,742
It'll save me much effort

536
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:42,702
if he takes on Xiao Jue first.

537
00:30:43,863 --> 00:30:45,143
Besides, once he steps in,

538
00:30:45,863 --> 00:30:46,703
whatever happens

539
00:30:47,302 --> 00:30:49,183
won't trace back to Master.

540
00:30:49,823 --> 00:30:51,183
And I can stay in the shadows,

541
00:30:51,702 --> 00:30:54,183
watch them stir things up in Yezhou,

542
00:30:54,663 --> 00:30:55,503
and find a chance

543
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,823
to obtain what Sun Xiangfu holds.

544
00:31:04,903 --> 00:31:05,743
Alright. Thanks.

545
00:31:09,383 --> 00:31:10,223
Try it.

546
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:11,583
Another veggie dish?

547
00:31:11,823 --> 00:31:13,143
The meat dishes will come.

548
00:31:15,902 --> 00:31:16,742
Here we go.

549
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:18,423
Let's all eat and drink heartily today.

550
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:19,423
Happy Mid-Autumn!

551
00:31:19,423 --> 00:31:20,536
- Happy Mid-Autumn!
- Happy Mid-Autumn!

552
00:31:26,982 --> 00:31:28,143
Come on, try this.

553
00:31:30,343 --> 00:31:31,183
He Yan.

554
00:31:31,502 --> 00:31:32,342
He Yan.

555
00:31:33,262 --> 00:31:34,392
Why are you zoning out?

556
00:31:34,623 --> 00:31:35,463
What's out there?

557
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,542
Isn't it the Mid-Autumn banquet?

558
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:38,742
Where is the Commander?

559
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:40,760
Huaijin won't come.

560
00:31:42,782 --> 00:31:43,622
Why not?

561
00:31:44,343 --> 00:31:46,343
Since when do you care
so much about him?

562
00:31:47,462 --> 00:31:49,863
Wasn't he supposed to
announce the enrollment

563
00:31:49,863 --> 00:31:51,743
into the Nine Banners Battalion?

564
00:31:52,183 --> 00:31:53,183
If he came,

565
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:54,623
would you dare

566
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:56,222
to eat and drink so casually?

567
00:31:58,143 --> 00:31:58,983
That's what I mean.

568
00:31:59,343 --> 00:32:00,423
You're awkward around him.

569
00:32:00,702 --> 00:32:02,382
He's uneasy in such lively places, too.

570
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,302
Why make everyone

571
00:32:03,302 --> 00:32:04,183
uncomfortable?

572
00:32:05,942 --> 00:32:06,782
Come on.

573
00:32:06,782 --> 00:32:07,622
Top performer.

574
00:32:07,903 --> 00:32:08,743
You go first.

575
00:32:10,902 --> 00:32:12,262
Pass them around, guys.

576
00:32:12,262 --> 00:32:13,102
Alright.

577
00:32:15,302 --> 00:32:16,302
(What's mine is mine.)

578
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:18,648
(I can wait a bit longer.)

579
00:32:20,062 --> 00:32:20,982
(Joining the battalion)

580
00:32:21,903 --> 00:32:24,783
(brings me one step closer
to reclaiming my position.)

581
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:30,903
Mr. Shen.

582
00:32:31,423 --> 00:32:32,263
Go on.

583
00:32:32,343 --> 00:32:33,183
Dig in.

584
00:32:33,343 --> 00:32:34,183
Don't hold back.

585
00:32:34,183 --> 00:32:35,703
- Sit down.
- Yes.

586
00:32:37,262 --> 00:32:38,102
Come on, dig in.

587
00:32:38,383 --> 00:32:39,223
This is

588
00:32:39,383 --> 00:32:40,702
a Mid-Autumn feast

589
00:32:40,702 --> 00:32:42,742
as well as your celebration banquet.

590
00:32:43,863 --> 00:32:45,583
We're usually not allowed to drink,

591
00:32:46,663 --> 00:32:48,143
but you won first place.

592
00:32:48,782 --> 00:32:49,622
So I

593
00:32:49,623 --> 00:32:51,502
brought this reward for you.

594
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:54,382
Easy.

595
00:32:54,823 --> 00:32:55,782
Don't be late

596
00:32:56,302 --> 00:32:57,542
for the morning training.

597
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,782
Or you'll face military discipline.

598
00:33:00,222 --> 00:33:01,062
- Yes.
- Yes.

599
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:01,902
Yes.

600
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:02,903
Get bowls.

601
00:33:02,903 --> 00:33:03,823
Get bowls. Hurry.

602
00:33:07,022 --> 00:33:07,862
Come on.

603
00:33:08,302 --> 00:33:09,142
Look at you.

604
00:33:11,502 --> 00:33:12,342
Mr. Shen.

605
00:33:13,423 --> 00:33:14,263
Need something?

606
00:33:16,742 --> 00:33:17,582
Mr. Shen.

607
00:33:18,022 --> 00:33:20,143
Are you here to announce the enrollment?

608
00:33:23,182 --> 00:33:24,022
Mr. Shen,

609
00:33:24,022 --> 00:33:25,423
do you have good news

610
00:33:25,982 --> 00:33:26,823
for us?

611
00:33:27,742 --> 00:33:28,582
Yeah, Mr. Shen.

612
00:33:28,662 --> 00:33:30,342
Stop keeping us in suspense.

613
00:33:30,623 --> 00:33:31,463
Yeah.

614
00:33:34,302 --> 00:33:35,142
Yeah.

615
00:33:35,422 --> 00:33:37,183
After I'm done here,

616
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:38,702
I'll offer Lei Hou

617
00:33:39,103 --> 00:33:39,943
my congratulations.

618
00:33:42,662 --> 00:33:43,502
Lei Hou?

619
00:33:43,502 --> 00:33:44,342
Lei Hou?

620
00:33:45,183 --> 00:33:46,023
Not He Yan?

621
00:33:46,343 --> 00:33:47,262
Wait, Mr. Shen.

622
00:33:47,383 --> 00:33:48,502
But He took first place...

623
00:33:48,823 --> 00:33:50,383
So what?

624
00:33:52,423 --> 00:33:53,263
Get back to it.

625
00:33:53,502 --> 00:33:54,342
Don't make a scene.

626
00:33:55,903 --> 00:33:56,823
Listen up.

627
00:33:57,423 --> 00:33:58,742
Commander selected soldiers

628
00:33:59,222 --> 00:34:01,263
based on a comprehensive evaluation.

629
00:34:02,022 --> 00:34:04,462
The contest was just one aspect.

630
00:34:06,823 --> 00:34:07,663
He Yan.

631
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:09,423
Stay sharp.

632
00:34:09,702 --> 00:34:10,863
You've got real potential.

633
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:12,742
You'll have many more chances.
