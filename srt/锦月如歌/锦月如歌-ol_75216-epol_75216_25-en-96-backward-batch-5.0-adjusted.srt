(Nor will I let Rundu fall.)

25
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,477
What are you doing here?

26
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:27,318
I told you she was suspicious.

27
00:02:27,558 --> 00:02:28,438
You didn't believe me.

28
00:02:29,278 --> 00:02:30,517
Looks like you're leaving.

29
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:31,718
Where are you going?

30
00:02:34,558 --> 00:02:35,398
To Rundu.

31
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:36,957
It's not far from Huayuan,

32
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:38,318
serving as a stronghold.

33
00:02:38,637 --> 00:02:39,477
The enemies

34
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:40,677
failed to take Huayuan,

35
00:02:40,998 --> 00:02:41,917
so they might divert

36
00:02:42,438 --> 00:02:43,278
to attack Rundu.

37
00:02:44,118 --> 00:02:46,278
Even if what you said is true,

38
00:02:46,398 --> 00:02:47,238
what can you do

39
00:02:47,477 --> 00:02:48,317
alone?

40
00:02:49,278 --> 00:02:50,118
An old friend of mine

41
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:51,677
is currently in Rundu.

42
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,398
I can't stand by while he's in danger.

43
00:02:55,197 --> 00:02:56,037
If that's the case,

44
00:02:56,398 --> 00:02:57,238
let's go together.

45
00:02:57,957 --> 00:02:58,797
No.

46
00:02:58,957 --> 00:03:00,158
Leaving without permission

47
00:03:00,278 --> 00:03:01,517
will get you punished.

48
00:03:01,998 --> 00:03:02,838
Moreover,

49
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,477
Rundu is extremely dangerous now.

50
00:03:06,357 --> 00:03:08,038
If it's that dangerous,

51
00:03:08,118 --> 00:03:09,838
we can't let a woman

52
00:03:09,838 --> 00:03:10,917
face this peril alone.

53
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,398
Exactly!

54
00:03:12,637 --> 00:03:13,637
Let's go together.

55
00:03:18,957 --> 00:03:19,797
When

56
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,158
did you know this?

57
00:03:25,118 --> 00:03:27,797
When you went to Jiyang with Commander.

58
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:34,237
That woman looks familiar.

59
00:03:34,397 --> 00:03:36,077
Did we see her somewhere before?

60
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:39,517
Don't you think she looks like He Yan?

61
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:40,757
Well,

62
00:03:41,278 --> 00:03:42,757
is that person

63
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:44,558
He's sister?

64
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:45,838
Not his sister.

65
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,558
That's He Yan herself.

66
00:03:49,357 --> 00:03:50,838
I knew it!

67
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,357
He is fair-skinned.

68
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:55,598
Turns out to be a woman.

69
00:03:55,797 --> 00:03:57,278
If He Yan is truly female,

70
00:03:57,357 --> 00:03:59,477
that's a big surprise.

71
00:03:59,998 --> 00:04:00,838
Wait,

72
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:02,077
but He dressed

73
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,118
in men's clothes

74
00:04:03,357 --> 00:04:04,398
all the time.

75
00:04:04,398 --> 00:04:06,077
But he's changed his clothes...

76
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:10,197
He's a she!

77
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:11,997
What should we call her now?

78
00:04:12,278 --> 00:04:13,198
He, naturally.

79
00:04:14,518 --> 00:04:15,358
Miss He?

80
00:04:15,477 --> 00:04:16,317
Anyway,

81
00:04:16,518 --> 00:04:17,638
let's keep her secret.

82
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:21,878
You knew my identity all along,

83
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:23,518
yet you kept it secret?

84
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:25,678
Of course.

85
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:27,237
Otherwise, you'll get expelled

86
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:28,518
for breaking rules.

87
00:04:31,518 --> 00:04:33,038
Even knowing I hide stuff from you,

88
00:04:33,797 --> 00:04:34,997
you still treat me the same.

89
00:04:36,278 --> 00:04:37,118
I am

90
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:38,917
truly grateful.

91
00:04:39,398 --> 00:04:41,198
Enough with the sentimental talk.

92
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:43,117
You're giving me goosebumps.

93
00:04:43,198 --> 00:04:44,237
Alright.

94
00:04:44,597 --> 00:04:45,437
However,

95
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:46,958
you can't go with me.

96
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:47,917
Why not?

97
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:48,797
If you can go,

98
00:04:48,797 --> 00:04:49,917
why can't we?

99
00:04:50,078 --> 00:04:51,758
Exactly! We're going together.

100
00:04:51,838 --> 00:04:53,078
She's now a military attendant,

101
00:04:53,398 --> 00:04:54,437
not a regional commander.

102
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:55,797
Yet it's an emergency.

103
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:58,038
I'll go with you all.

104
00:04:59,838 --> 00:05:00,758
You don't have to.

105
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:03,136
As Director of the Ministry of War,

106
00:05:03,398 --> 00:05:04,960
overseeing military affairs is my job.

107
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:05,958
How can I sit on this?

108
00:05:12,557 --> 00:05:13,397
Well...

109
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:15,798
The more hands,

110
00:05:16,278 --> 00:05:17,118
the better.

111
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:18,558
Isn't it good?

112
00:05:19,357 --> 00:05:20,278
You're going

113
00:05:20,437 --> 00:05:21,398
for official business,

114
00:05:21,877 --> 00:05:23,598
while I'm going for personal reasons.

115
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:27,078
What makes you think so?

116
00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:30,598
Why are you alone?

117
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:31,838
Where's Yingxiang?

118
00:05:32,317 --> 00:05:33,157
It happened abruptly.

119
00:05:33,437 --> 00:05:34,838
I sent her to handle something.

120
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:36,997
Enough.

121
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:38,317
Let's not dawdle any longer.

122
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,678
Come on.

123
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:41,397
Go.

124
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:15,744
(Battlefield in Rundu)

125
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:18,117
We'll arrive in Rundu soon.

126
00:06:19,237 --> 00:06:20,077
I'm afraid

127
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:21,917
we can't enter through the city gates.

128
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,758
You were right.

129
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:28,718
Wutuo is attacking Rundu.

130
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:30,518
It seems

131
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:32,357
He Rufei hasn't come.

132
00:06:33,638 --> 00:06:34,598
(He Rufei.)

133
00:06:34,997 --> 00:06:36,357
(You knew I'd come, didn't you?)

134
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:38,957
(Planning to use Wutuo to eliminate me?)

135
00:06:39,557 --> 00:06:40,397
(Guess what?)

136
00:06:40,518 --> 00:06:41,677
(I won't let you succeed.)

137
00:06:41,997 --> 00:06:43,237
Rundu is currently besieged.

138
00:06:43,677 --> 00:06:44,557
How should we proceed?

139
00:06:44,997 --> 00:06:45,837
Follow me.

140
00:06:45,957 --> 00:06:47,637
I know of a secret tunnel into the city.

141
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:56,427
(Commander's Mansion)

142
00:07:01,198 --> 00:07:02,038
Commander.

143
00:07:02,496 --> 00:07:04,128
Reinforcements from Huayuan
haven't come.

144
00:07:04,518 --> 00:07:05,917
Our supplies are exhausted.

145
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:07,558
If we break through,

146
00:07:08,158 --> 00:07:09,518
we might be able to turn the tide.

147
00:07:10,117 --> 00:07:10,957
Stay calm.

148
00:07:11,437 --> 00:07:13,158
Wutuo's soldiers aren't made of iron.

149
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:14,997
They need provisions too.

150
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,317
Moreover,

151
00:07:16,317 --> 00:07:17,718
they've deployed larger forces.

152
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,518
They need more supply.

153
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:21,758
Without a quick victory,

154
00:07:22,117 --> 00:07:23,038
their morale

155
00:07:23,198 --> 00:07:24,437
will dwindle faster than ours.

156
00:07:24,517 --> 00:07:25,357
But...

157
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:26,398
Unrest is spreading.

158
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:27,718
Some grow restless,

159
00:07:27,718 --> 00:07:28,558
afraid of chaos.

160
00:07:28,838 --> 00:07:30,038
Deploy patrols

161
00:07:30,237 --> 00:07:31,557
to maintain order day and night.

162
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:32,837
As you command.

163
00:07:34,158 --> 00:07:34,998
Mr. Wang.

164
00:07:35,317 --> 00:07:36,157
Master.

165
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:38,197
Why are you here?

166
00:07:39,437 --> 00:07:41,158
(Qi Luo, Li Kuang's concubine)
You haven't eaten all day.

167
00:07:41,398 --> 00:07:42,718
That's not good.

168
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:44,718
If Wutuo attacks again,

169
00:07:44,838 --> 00:07:46,317
we need you to lead us.

170
00:07:48,078 --> 00:07:49,038
You stay out

171
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:49,917
of military affairs.

172
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:51,997
I apologize.

173
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:53,157
Leave us now.

174
00:07:53,317 --> 00:07:54,278
I have official matters.

175
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:56,197
Yes.

176
00:07:59,398 --> 00:08:00,437
Why hasn't General Feihong

177
00:08:00,877 --> 00:08:01,877
arrived yet?

178
00:08:02,477 --> 00:08:03,477
Huayuan isn't far

179
00:08:03,477 --> 00:08:04,317
from Rundu.

180
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,237
Rundu is tightly encircled.

181
00:08:06,797 --> 00:08:08,078
Even General Feihong will

182
00:08:08,477 --> 00:08:09,518
struggle to break through.

183
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:10,757
Commander!

184
00:08:11,397 --> 00:08:12,997
- Commander!
- What's it?

185
00:08:12,997 --> 00:08:14,158
Intruders have infiltrated.

186
00:08:14,717 --> 00:08:15,557
What?

187
00:08:15,557 --> 00:08:16,518
Could they be

188
00:08:16,557 --> 00:08:17,397
reinforcements?

189
00:08:23,718 --> 00:08:24,558
General!

190
00:08:29,638 --> 00:08:30,597
(Not him?)

191
00:08:31,638 --> 00:08:32,998
(But he looks like...)

192
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:35,238
Well,

193
00:08:35,478 --> 00:08:36,318
who are you?

194
00:08:39,837 --> 00:08:41,638
I'm He Yan, a military attendant.

195
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:42,878
Nice to meet you.

196
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:44,797
He Yan?

197
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,238
Rundu is being besieged

198
00:08:46,238 --> 00:08:47,118
by Wutuo.

199
00:08:47,717 --> 00:08:48,797
How did you enter?

200
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:50,757
Commander Li.

201
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,358
This isn't the place

202
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:54,278
for discussions.

203
00:08:55,478 --> 00:08:57,437
I'm Chu Zhao,
Director of the Ministry of War.

204
00:09:02,758 --> 00:09:03,758
You two, come with me.

205
00:09:04,118 --> 00:09:05,238
The rest, wait outside.

206
00:09:11,557 --> 00:09:12,677
What's wrong with him?

207
00:09:18,117 --> 00:09:18,957
When General Feihong

208
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:19,957
garrisoned Rundu,

209
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:21,557
he ordered me to dig a tunnel

210
00:09:21,717 --> 00:09:22,557
leading out of town.

211
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:23,758
Besides us two,

212
00:09:23,758 --> 00:09:24,837
only trusted aides knew it.

213
00:09:25,238 --> 00:09:26,437
No one else

214
00:09:26,478 --> 00:09:27,398
could know about it.

215
00:09:28,038 --> 00:09:29,478
How did you enter?

216
00:09:40,478 --> 00:09:41,998
If I'm correct,

217
00:09:42,518 --> 00:09:43,712
the letter for help was sent

218
00:09:43,837 --> 00:09:44,998
through that tunnel, right?

219
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:48,317
How do you know
General Feihong's grappling skills?

220
00:09:55,317 --> 00:09:57,118
I served in the Fuyue Army

221
00:09:58,317 --> 00:09:59,638
as a garrison officer in Huayuan

222
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:01,878
under General Wang Qi.

223
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:04,917
He taught me grappling skills.

224
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:06,478
He told me

225
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:07,917
about the secret tunnel.

226
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:09,998
But rest assured,

227
00:10:10,238 --> 00:10:11,597
I haven't disclosed it to anyone.

228
00:10:12,398 --> 00:10:13,717
What brings you here?

229
00:10:16,638 --> 00:10:17,677
I hear Rundu is besieged

230
00:10:18,077 --> 00:10:19,077
and you're in danger.

231
00:10:19,358 --> 00:10:20,238
So, I rushed here.

232
00:10:26,118 --> 00:10:26,958
Just for that?

233
00:10:27,597 --> 00:10:28,557
If the city falls,

234
00:10:29,118 --> 00:10:31,118
no one in this city will survive.

235
00:10:31,437 --> 00:10:33,197
As a soldier
sworn to protect the nation,

236
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:34,597
how could I stand by?

237
00:10:36,638 --> 00:10:37,478
Moreover,

238
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:38,917
this is also to repay

239
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,358
General Wang Qi's trust in me.

240
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:42,077
I wish to help.

241
00:10:48,317 --> 00:10:49,157
Master.

242
00:10:49,158 --> 00:10:49,998
You're injured.

243
00:10:50,437 --> 00:10:51,317
How are you doing?

244
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:53,597
Let me get medicine for you.

245
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,317
A woman like you

246
00:10:55,557 --> 00:10:56,717
always makes a big fuss.

247
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,077
It's just a minor injury.

248
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:01,557
I apologize.

249
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:05,638
Madam, you're quite considerate.

250
00:11:06,478 --> 00:11:07,597
You did nothing wrong.

251
00:11:08,038 --> 00:11:08,878
Don't blame yourself.

252
00:11:13,478 --> 00:11:15,437
Mr. He's grappling technique

253
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:17,437
is truly impressive.

254
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:20,797
Commander,

255
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:23,077
what do you think of

256
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:24,118
Mr. He's skill?

257
00:11:24,837 --> 00:11:25,758
It's impressive.

258
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:29,118
Surprisingly, you already
master Fuyue Army's footwork

259
00:11:29,317 --> 00:11:31,398
and techniques.

260
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:32,878
I see Wang Qi has

261
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,358
taught you everything he knew.

262
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:35,318
By the way,

263
00:11:35,398 --> 00:11:36,238
how is Wang Qi

264
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:37,078
doing lately?

265
00:11:55,358 --> 00:11:56,317
I'll toast you with tea

266
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:57,677
to thank you

267
00:11:57,837 --> 00:11:59,118
for helping settle my buddies.

268
00:12:06,998 --> 00:12:09,038
Rundu has been besieged for days.

269
00:12:09,518 --> 00:12:11,278
The secret tunnel is cramped,

270
00:12:11,837 --> 00:12:13,317
and I fear the enemy will find it.

271
00:12:13,597 --> 00:12:14,635
I can't use it frequently.

272
00:12:14,998 --> 00:12:17,597
I am ill-informed right now.

273
00:12:17,878 --> 00:12:18,718
I hope

274
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,797
you can update me.

275
00:12:21,478 --> 00:12:23,358
The news that Rundu is being besieged

276
00:12:23,998 --> 00:12:25,478
has been deliberately suppressed.

277
00:12:25,797 --> 00:12:26,998
Yezhou Garrison hasn't heard.

278
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:28,957
Even nearby Huayuan

279
00:12:29,118 --> 00:12:30,317
shows no signs of action.

280
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:31,878
Furthermore,

281
00:12:31,957 --> 00:12:32,957
there's something else.

282
00:12:33,717 --> 00:12:34,557
When we

283
00:12:34,677 --> 00:12:35,638
used the secret tunnel,

284
00:12:36,077 --> 00:12:38,118
Wutuo soldiers seemed to notice.

285
00:12:38,597 --> 00:12:39,677
To prevent them

286
00:12:39,797 --> 00:12:41,358
from using the tunnel to enter,

287
00:12:41,797 --> 00:12:43,197
we sealed the tunnel.

288
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:45,077
It is now impassable.

289
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:47,797
Sorry, we did that

290
00:12:47,837 --> 00:12:49,077
without your permission.

291
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:50,598
Never mind.

292
00:12:52,197 --> 00:12:53,037
That tunnel

293
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:55,797
has limited use, anyway.

294
00:12:56,478 --> 00:12:57,597
Rest assured, Commander Li,

295
00:12:57,957 --> 00:12:59,238
I'll find solutions

296
00:12:59,797 --> 00:13:01,238
to ensure our soldiers and citizens

297
00:13:01,398 --> 00:13:02,238
aren't left helpless.

298
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:05,118
I've instructed Yingxiang

299
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:06,597
to spread the information

300
00:13:06,957 --> 00:13:08,196
and written to Ministry of War.

301
00:13:08,638 --> 00:13:09,478
I suppose

302
00:13:09,758 --> 00:13:11,317
the capital must be informed.

303
00:13:12,478 --> 00:13:13,398
So,

304
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:14,758
you had Yingxiang

305
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:15,717
handle that matter.

306
00:13:18,038 --> 00:13:19,317
But distant help

307
00:13:20,238 --> 00:13:21,917
can't quench present fires.

308
00:13:22,358 --> 00:13:23,198
To be frank,

309
00:13:23,717 --> 00:13:24,957
we're running out of food.

310
00:13:25,557 --> 00:13:26,638
We won't last long.

311
00:13:27,638 --> 00:13:29,478
Before supplies run out,

312
00:13:30,437 --> 00:13:32,197
we can only hope General Feihong...

313
00:13:32,398 --> 00:13:33,238
Mr. Li.

314
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:34,238
Have you considered

315
00:13:34,837 --> 00:13:36,518
an attack instead of a defense?

316
00:13:37,158 --> 00:13:38,398
Rather than await doom,

317
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:40,118
why not take initiative?

318
00:13:41,077 --> 00:13:42,917
A desperate fight sounds good,

319
00:13:43,318 --> 00:13:44,158
but how can I gamble

320
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:46,437
with tens of thousands of lives?

321
00:13:46,558 --> 00:13:47,398
Moreover,

322
00:13:47,398 --> 00:13:48,677
Rundu is just the first line.

323
00:13:48,757 --> 00:13:50,597
Chonghuai will fall after it.

324
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:51,837
- Heading north...
- Commander.

325
00:13:51,837 --> 00:13:52,677
I...

326
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,557
Stop waiting for He Rufei.

327
00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:01,717
Didn't you just ask me

328
00:14:02,837 --> 00:14:04,398
about Wang Qi?

329
00:14:06,197 --> 00:14:07,437
Let me tell you now.

330
00:14:09,597 --> 00:14:10,478
He's dead.

331
00:14:15,957 --> 00:14:18,118
He died in the recent Huayuan Battle.

332
00:14:19,077 --> 00:14:20,238
Not just Wang Qi,

333
00:14:20,957 --> 00:14:22,597
but your six other buddies

334
00:14:25,238 --> 00:14:26,118
are all dead.

335
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:32,437
Don't you understand yet?

336
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:35,917
He Rufei

337
00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:38,677
won't come.

338
00:14:42,158 --> 00:14:43,398
You stay defensive,

339
00:14:44,038 --> 00:14:46,157
essentially surrendering
without a fight.

340
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,757
This is truly gambling
with the lives of the citizens.

341
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:56,158
There's no time left for grief now.

342
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:58,277
Commander Li,

343
00:14:58,638 --> 00:15:00,118
we can't just wait for death.

344
00:15:00,557 --> 00:15:01,998
We must take the initiative.

345
00:15:02,478 --> 00:15:03,318
Tell me.

346
00:15:03,398 --> 00:15:04,238
How has the enemy

347
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:05,278
been attacking recently?

348
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:08,077
In the last ten days,

349
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:09,797
there were five nights

350
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:12,038
when they attacked the city gates.

351
00:15:13,318 --> 00:15:15,317
Though they withdrew each time,

352
00:15:17,238 --> 00:15:18,317
it seemed like a test.

353
00:15:19,957 --> 00:15:21,038
In the last three days,

354
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:23,437
they have gone silent.

355
00:15:24,398 --> 00:15:25,638
Based on my experience

356
00:15:26,118 --> 00:15:27,358
fighting them,

357
00:15:27,837 --> 00:15:28,797
their silence

358
00:15:30,158 --> 00:15:31,317
doesn't bode well.

359
00:15:32,758 --> 00:15:33,598
I guess they are

360
00:15:34,437 --> 00:15:35,717
planning a full-scale assault.

361
00:15:36,158 --> 00:15:38,317
They've thoroughly assessed our defense

362
00:15:38,478 --> 00:15:39,478
by now.

363
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:41,358
Our forces in Rundu

364
00:15:41,677 --> 00:15:43,917
have been worn down
after days of fighting.

365
00:15:44,158 --> 00:15:45,358
Soldiers' morale and stamina

366
00:15:45,557 --> 00:15:46,518
are getting worse.

367
00:15:47,358 --> 00:15:48,917
If they launch an attack now,

368
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:50,118
the city gates

369
00:15:50,398 --> 00:15:51,358
will surely fall.

370
00:15:54,758 --> 00:15:57,197
Sounds like you know them pretty well.

371
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:58,797
Commander Li,

372
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:00,077
you're missing the point.

373
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,037
Look,

374
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:07,118
it's not that

375
00:16:07,118 --> 00:16:08,278
we refuse to be proactive,

376
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:10,637
but our forces are already limited.

377
00:16:10,797 --> 00:16:11,797
Right now, the enemies

378
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:13,077
are watching the gate.

379
00:16:14,197 --> 00:16:15,077
I fear

380
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:16,638
our men will be shot with arrows

381
00:16:16,638 --> 00:16:18,437
before going outside the city gate.

382
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:20,277
Arrows?

383
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,278
Initially,

384
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:22,398
when Wutuo troops arrived,

385
00:16:22,758 --> 00:16:24,637
we could fight them on the city walls.

386
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:26,037
But later,

387
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:27,677
our arrows dwindled,

388
00:16:27,998 --> 00:16:29,797
while theirs remained plentiful.

389
00:16:30,677 --> 00:16:32,638
Earlier, some tried
to infiltrate their ranks

390
00:16:32,878 --> 00:16:34,197
to assassinate their commander.

391
00:16:34,758 --> 00:16:36,597
But the moment they exited the gate,

392
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:39,358
they were pierced by countless arrows.

393
00:16:40,597 --> 00:16:41,518
Do the enemies

394
00:16:41,998 --> 00:16:42,838
have numerous arrows?

395
00:16:43,398 --> 00:16:44,238
Yes.

396
00:16:47,837 --> 00:16:48,717
I have a plan.

397
00:16:49,197 --> 00:16:50,118
If executed properly,

398
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:51,968
it can achieve two goals at once.

399
00:17:20,478 --> 00:17:21,918
We've waited here long enough.

400
00:17:22,238 --> 00:17:23,518
He Rufei isn't coming.

401
00:17:23,872 --> 00:17:25,792
(Nagur, Wutuo's Commander)
The Chancellor was right.

402
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:27,758
Thankfully, we don't

403
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,117
fight against Xiao Jue.

404
00:17:29,797 --> 00:17:30,637
Report!

405
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,157
Commander.

406
00:17:33,157 --> 00:17:34,656
Someone is descending the city walls.

407
00:17:36,637 --> 00:17:37,557
Let's go take a look.

408
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,077
Have they gone mad?

409
00:17:49,117 --> 00:17:51,038
This is suicide!

410
00:17:51,478 --> 00:17:52,637
In our homeland,

411
00:17:52,758 --> 00:17:53,837
there are badgers,

412
00:17:54,077 --> 00:17:55,117
which are quite timid.

413
00:17:55,718 --> 00:17:56,918
I hear when hunted,

414
00:17:57,238 --> 00:17:58,198
they don't flee

415
00:17:58,637 --> 00:17:59,557
but panic

416
00:17:59,637 --> 00:18:00,797
and run toward the arrows.

417
00:18:01,198 --> 00:18:02,038
I think

418
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:04,157
they are the same.

419
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:06,557
Get archers ready.

420
00:18:07,518 --> 00:18:08,758
Good target practice.

421
00:18:09,077 --> 00:18:09,917
Yes!

422
00:18:10,597 --> 00:18:12,038
Archers, take positions!

423
00:18:27,998 --> 00:18:28,838
Shoot!

424
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:45,238
We have no arrows.

425
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:46,597
During daylight,

426
00:18:46,597 --> 00:18:48,252
our soldiers don't dare
come up the walls.

427
00:18:48,598 --> 00:18:49,438
Those stationed

428
00:18:49,438 --> 00:18:50,278
on the walls

429
00:18:50,478 --> 00:18:51,678
get hit by arrows every day.

430
00:18:51,878 --> 00:18:53,718
Yet we lack sufficient arrows
to fight back.

431
00:18:54,078 --> 00:18:55,758
Now, we finally have arrows.

432
00:18:56,357 --> 00:18:58,077
This tactic feels familiar.

433
00:18:58,478 --> 00:18:59,998
Maybe I've read it in some storybook.

434
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:02,198
But it works well.

435
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:05,278
Past lessons guide future actions.

436
00:19:05,757 --> 00:19:06,597
The enemies

437
00:19:06,597 --> 00:19:07,877
rely on their superior numbers.

438
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:09,117
They're too arrogant

439
00:19:09,478 --> 00:19:10,837
to believe they could fail.

440
00:19:11,238 --> 00:19:12,117
These straw dummies

441
00:19:12,158 --> 00:19:14,077
won't draw their attention.

442
00:19:14,358 --> 00:19:16,117
They think we have nothing,

443
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:17,278
no soldiers,

444
00:19:17,278 --> 00:19:18,118
no provisions,

445
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,038
and no help.

446
00:19:19,317 --> 00:19:20,478
So, we'll turn nothing

447
00:19:20,597 --> 00:19:21,758
into something.

448
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,157
Catch them unprepared!

449
00:19:24,238 --> 00:19:25,078
But

450
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:26,958
what if we fail?

451
00:19:28,157 --> 00:19:29,238
Then we find another way.

452
00:19:29,478 --> 00:19:30,318
In this world,

453
00:19:30,557 --> 00:19:31,918
there's never just one way.

454
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:39,918
Report!

455
00:19:42,358 --> 00:19:43,198
Commander.

456
00:19:43,198 --> 00:19:44,637
They descend from the walls again.

457
00:19:47,317 --> 00:19:48,958
Those reckless fools!

458
00:20:09,518 --> 00:20:10,358
Commander.

459
00:20:10,557 --> 00:20:11,518
What's wrong

460
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:12,677
with them?

461
00:20:12,998 --> 00:20:13,998
Aren't they afraid?

462
00:20:14,518 --> 00:20:15,840
We've rotated archers repeatedly.

463
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:25,438
When you fired arrows,

464
00:20:26,157 --> 00:20:27,438
did you hear any screams?

465
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,358
Today,

466
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:30,278
I didn't.

467
00:20:31,278 --> 00:20:32,118
Stop!

468
00:20:32,797 --> 00:20:33,797
Stop shooting right now!

469
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:40,558
So many arrows.

470
00:20:40,598 --> 00:20:41,438
Pull them out!

471
00:20:41,438 --> 00:20:42,278
Come on.

472
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:55,878
General.

473
00:20:56,397 --> 00:20:57,758
They are descending again.

474
00:21:01,397 --> 00:21:02,637
Do they think we are

475
00:21:02,877 --> 00:21:04,238
giving arrows to them again?

476
00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:09,038
Pass the order.

477
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:11,078
Fire a few arrows.

478
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:12,357
Even if we break ours,

479
00:21:13,117 --> 00:21:14,117
we won't let them

480
00:21:14,198 --> 00:21:15,758
get our arrows again!

481
00:21:16,518 --> 00:21:17,358
Understood.

482
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:34,758
(Three Days Earlier)
Today,

483
00:21:34,758 --> 00:21:35,877
we didn't scream.

484
00:21:36,397 --> 00:21:37,478
Won't the enemies realize

485
00:21:37,478 --> 00:21:38,318
our true purpose?

486
00:21:38,518 --> 00:21:39,358
It's hard

487
00:21:39,637 --> 00:21:40,477
to fool them again.

488
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:42,038
I made straw dummies

489
00:21:42,317 --> 00:21:43,518
not just to get arrows.

490
00:21:43,797 --> 00:21:44,758
After tonight,

491
00:21:44,918 --> 00:21:45,758
the enemies

492
00:21:45,918 --> 00:21:47,438
must sense something's wrong.

493
00:21:47,718 --> 00:21:48,558
That's for sure.

494
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:51,717
Mr. Li,

495
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,038
if you were the enemy

496
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,637
and realized you'd been fooled
all night,

497
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:57,317
then saw the same trick today

498
00:21:57,518 --> 00:21:58,718
and again tomorrow,

499
00:21:59,117 --> 00:21:59,957
what would you do?

500
00:22:00,157 --> 00:22:00,997
Never fall for it.

501
00:22:01,637 --> 00:22:04,077
Stop shooting at people
descending the walls?

502
00:22:04,238 --> 00:22:05,078
Exactly.

503
00:22:05,317 --> 00:22:06,157
Perfect.

504
00:22:06,478 --> 00:22:07,318
Next time,

505
00:22:07,318 --> 00:22:08,958
our troops can exit the city directly.

506
00:22:09,637 --> 00:22:10,998
The enemies will assume

507
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:12,637
anyone descending the walls

508
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:15,157
is just another straw dummy.

509
00:22:24,637 --> 00:22:25,477
Mother,

510
00:22:26,317 --> 00:22:27,278
I beg you

511
00:22:27,998 --> 00:22:29,317
to protect He Yan

512
00:22:30,438 --> 00:22:31,797
and let her return safely.

513
00:22:34,611 --> 00:22:36,768
(Wutuo's Barracks)

514
00:23:19,518 --> 00:23:20,358
Come.

515
00:23:22,557 --> 00:23:23,397
We should

516
00:23:23,397 --> 00:23:25,238
split up and locate the granaries first.

517
00:23:25,398 --> 00:23:26,238
Listen,

518
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,157
stay cautious.

519
00:23:27,317 --> 00:23:28,157
Got it?

520
00:23:28,837 --> 00:23:31,357
Are the oil packets ready?

521
00:23:31,438 --> 00:23:32,397
The oil.

522
00:23:33,397 --> 00:23:34,518
Right here!

523
00:23:35,317 --> 00:23:36,157
Move!

524
00:23:36,157 --> 00:23:37,958
- Let's go!
- Move!

525
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:38,918
- Go!
- Go!

526
00:23:53,158 --> 00:23:53,998
Help!

527
00:23:53,998 --> 00:23:54,838
Stop right there.

528
00:23:55,357 --> 00:23:56,197
Come here!

529
00:23:56,678 --> 00:23:57,518
Come on.

530
00:23:58,957 --> 00:23:59,797
Stop running.

531
00:23:59,797 --> 00:24:00,637
Be good.

532
00:24:03,157 --> 00:24:04,278
Help!

533
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:05,118
Don't run!

534
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:06,598
Go over.

535
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:07,918
Get over here!

536
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,038
Let go of me!

537
00:24:10,837 --> 00:24:11,677
Let go of me!

538
00:24:12,597 --> 00:24:13,438
Come on.

539
00:24:13,757 --> 00:24:14,597
Let go of me!

540
00:24:14,597 --> 00:24:15,437
He.

541
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:16,958
I know you pity them.

542
00:24:17,357 --> 00:24:18,397
But now, burning granaries

543
00:24:18,397 --> 00:24:19,237
is our mission.

544
00:24:19,478 --> 00:24:20,438
If we save them now,

545
00:24:20,758 --> 00:24:21,797
Mai and Wang Ba

546
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:22,717
will get trapped.

547
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:24,198
Our entire plan will fail.

548
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:25,238
More people will

549
00:24:25,238 --> 00:24:26,078
end up suffering.

550
00:24:27,077 --> 00:24:27,917
Come on.

551
00:24:28,317 --> 00:24:29,157
Come here.

552
00:24:31,077 --> 00:24:31,917
We'll save them

553
00:24:32,397 --> 00:24:33,237
and burn granaries.

554
00:24:33,518 --> 00:24:34,518
Set the fires first,

555
00:24:34,797 --> 00:24:35,637
then rescue them.

556
00:24:41,637 --> 00:24:42,597
Fire!

557
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:43,918
Fire!

558
00:24:44,278 --> 00:24:45,278
Put it out!

559
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:47,117
Fire!

560
00:24:48,637 --> 00:24:49,477
Hurry!

561
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,157
Don't be afraid.

562
00:24:51,918 --> 00:24:52,758
Thank you.

563
00:24:52,797 --> 00:24:53,637
Thank you, sir.

564
00:24:53,797 --> 00:24:55,077
Please save us, sir.

565
00:24:55,438 --> 00:24:56,958
- Please save us.
- Please save us.

566
00:24:59,517 --> 00:25:00,357
Huang.

567
00:25:00,357 --> 00:25:01,557
The fire's already raging.

568
00:25:01,837 --> 00:25:02,877
Take them away.

569
00:25:03,838 --> 00:25:05,478
Remember, don't attempt to fight.

570
00:25:05,478 --> 00:25:06,318
Make sure

571
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:07,358
that all of us

572
00:25:07,397 --> 00:25:08,278
return safely.

573
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:09,477
- Yes.
- Yes.

574
00:25:57,797 --> 00:25:58,797
It's General Feihong!

575
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:01,198
Well...

576
00:26:01,198 --> 00:26:02,038
Is it really him?

577
00:26:03,597 --> 00:26:04,998
He Rufei can't be in Rundu.

578
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:06,998
This man is an imposter!

579
00:26:08,518 --> 00:26:10,357
(He Rufei is indeed involved.)

580
00:26:10,718 --> 00:26:11,558
Everyone, attack!

581
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:12,677
Kill them all!

582
00:26:49,478 --> 00:26:50,318
Qinglang Sword?

583
00:26:51,438 --> 00:26:52,357
The same skills.

584
00:26:53,837 --> 00:26:55,438
Could he be General Feihong?

585
00:26:56,117 --> 00:26:56,957
Move out!

586
00:27:00,918 --> 00:27:01,758
After them!

587
00:27:01,758 --> 00:27:02,598
Chase them down!

588
00:27:02,638 --> 00:27:03,478
Kill!

589
00:27:03,478 --> 00:27:04,318
Today,

590
00:27:04,358 --> 00:27:05,198
I swear

591
00:27:05,198 --> 00:27:07,637
I'll kill He Rufei, a faithless man.

592
00:27:14,397 --> 00:27:15,797
(I demanded a squad from Li Kuang.)

593
00:27:16,357 --> 00:27:17,197
I told him

594
00:27:17,597 --> 00:27:19,117
that my team would

595
00:27:19,758 --> 00:27:21,518
definitely burn the enemies' granaries.

596
00:27:21,797 --> 00:27:23,278
When you see flames rise,

597
00:27:23,797 --> 00:27:24,718
it means I succeed.

598
00:27:26,397 --> 00:27:27,237
Okay.

599
00:27:28,077 --> 00:27:29,518
I'll wait for the flames

601
00:27:36,718 --> 00:27:37,558
They did it.

602
00:27:38,837 --> 00:27:39,758

Rundu is besieged.

Chu Zhao went with them too.

651
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:39,917
So,

652
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,038
given the information you got

653
00:29:42,678 --> 00:29:44,918
and her current act of aiding Rundu,

654
00:29:45,797 --> 00:29:47,077

658
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,438
She took Qinglang.

659
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:53,918
(Rundu is in peril.)

660
00:30:54,077 --> 00:30:54,917
(I'm going to help.)

666
00:31:54,598 --> 00:31:55,438
Why did you

667
00:31:55,438 --> 00:31:56,478
address He like that?

668
00:31:56,517 --> 00:31:58,357
He isn't a general yet.

669
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:06,598
This craftsman

670
00:32:06,637 --> 00:32:07,557
has exceptional skills.

671
00:32:08,317 --> 00:32:09,157
The mask he made

672
00:32:09,357 --> 00:32:10,438
looks utterly realistic.

673
00:32:11,758 --> 00:32:12,718
Last night, the enemies

674
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:14,797
were fooled by this disguise too.

675
00:32:14,797 --> 00:32:16,478
They mistook me for General Feihong.

676
00:32:17,718 --> 00:32:19,317
This is truly masterful work.

677
00:32:20,837 --> 00:32:22,157
I also made a mistake.

678
00:32:22,918 --> 00:32:23,958
It's all ready.

679
00:32:26,198 --> 00:32:27,038
Well...

680
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,077
General Feihong?

681
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:32,957
Mr. Li.

682
00:32:33,397 --> 00:32:34,958
He is just a military attendant,

683
00:32:35,317 --> 00:32:36,438
not yet promoted to general.

684
00:32:38,597 --> 00:32:39,437
I meant,

685
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:40,758
this mask

686
00:32:41,198 --> 00:32:42,597
belonged to General Feihong.

687
00:32:44,198 --> 00:32:45,278
What exactly will you do?

688
00:32:46,557 --> 00:32:47,837
Make a mixture of illusions

689
00:32:48,637 --> 00:32:49,518
and truths.

690
00:32:50,478 --> 00:32:51,718
Even Nagur hasn't seen

691
00:32:51,758 --> 00:32:52,998
the real General Feihong.

692
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:54,718
But he must have heard

693
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:57,918
about the masked general's
fierce battle against Liehe.

694
00:33:00,518 --> 00:33:03,117
I'll infiltrate the enemy camp
wearing this mask.

695
00:33:04,198 --> 00:33:05,038
They won't know

696
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:07,078
who's truly beneath the mask.

697
00:33:07,758 --> 00:33:08,718
Their fear will

698
00:33:09,117 --> 00:33:10,038
destroy their morale.

699
00:33:10,837 --> 00:33:11,677
Then,

700
00:33:12,238 --> 00:33:13,918
we'll seize the opportunity.

701
00:33:19,157 --> 00:33:19,997
Commander Li.

702
00:33:20,518 --> 00:33:21,877
With their provisions burned

703
00:33:22,198 --> 00:33:24,437
and their fear
of General Feihong's presence in Rundu,

704
00:33:24,438 --> 00:33:25,278
I think

705
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:26,478
they'll observe the situation.

706
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,278
An immediate attack seems unlikely.

707
00:33:28,678 --> 00:33:30,157
This is our opportunity.

708
00:33:30,518 --> 00:33:31,358
Deploy

709
00:33:31,557 --> 00:33:32,797
a preemptive strike

710
00:33:33,198 --> 00:33:34,357
to resolve this swiftly

711
00:33:34,518 --> 00:33:36,077
and solve the food crisis.

712
00:33:38,397 --> 00:33:39,237
Commander Li.

713
00:33:39,637 --> 00:33:40,998
Our provisions are insufficient.

714
00:33:41,157 --> 00:33:42,117
We can't afford delays.

715
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:43,797
If reinforcements don't come,

716
00:33:44,077 --> 00:33:45,077
people will die.

717
00:33:45,478 --> 00:33:46,837
You're versed in military tactics.

718
00:33:46,837 --> 00:33:47,677
You must know

719
00:33:47,837 --> 00:33:48,677
that defending a city

720
00:33:48,718 --> 00:33:50,117
is doomed if people starve.

721
00:33:51,157 --> 00:33:51,997
Public unrest

722
00:33:52,317 --> 00:33:53,157
breeds chaos.

723
00:33:55,678 --> 00:33:56,518
Commander Li.

724
00:33:57,157 --> 00:33:58,278
With the enemy at our gate,

725
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,117
opportunities vanish quickly.

726
00:34:05,197 --> 00:34:06,037
Alright.

727
00:34:06,117 --> 00:34:07,677
I'll adjust the city's defenses,

728
00:34:07,998 --> 00:34:09,038
take inventory of weapons,

729
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:10,757
and figure out a solution.

730
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:12,957
By the way,

731
00:34:13,277 --> 00:34:14,117
one more thing.

732
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:16,077
Regarding the women I rescued,

733
00:34:16,357 --> 00:34:17,197
I need

734
00:34:17,197 --> 00:34:18,798
to trouble you to check

735
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,637
if they have relatives in the city.

736
00:34:21,038 --> 00:34:21,878
If they do,

737
00:34:22,157 --> 00:34:23,918
have their relatives take them home.

738
00:34:24,478 --> 00:34:25,318
If not,

739
00:34:25,757 --> 00:34:26,717
please

740
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,277
properly settle them for me.

741
00:34:31,677 --> 00:34:32,517
Commander Li.

742
00:34:33,077 --> 00:34:34,197
I don't care what you think.

743
00:34:34,438 --> 00:34:35,318
These women

744
00:34:35,677 --> 00:34:36,918
are all citizens of Wei.

745
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,358
They're people of Rundu.

746
00:34:39,637 --> 00:34:40,838
As the city's commander,

747
00:34:41,197 --> 00:34:42,438
you can't ignore them.

748
00:34:43,237 --> 00:34:44,277
A soldier's duty

749
00:34:44,597 --> 00:34:45,798
is to protect the people,

750
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:47,838
rich or poor,

751
00:34:48,117 --> 00:34:48,957
without considering

752
00:34:49,038 --> 00:34:50,038
what they've experienced.

753
00:34:51,318 --> 00:34:52,158
Fine.

754
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:53,198
I understand.

755
00:35:00,677 --> 00:35:01,677
You have enough medicine?

756
00:35:02,157 --> 00:35:02,997
Sure.

757
00:35:03,317 --> 00:35:04,157
Let me help.

758
00:35:04,157 --> 00:35:04,997
I'll help you.

759
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,237
How's your leg injury?

760
00:35:08,277 --> 00:35:09,358
If you need more ointment,

761
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,438
I'll have them fetch it.

Thank you.

763
00:35:11,637 --> 00:35:12,477
It hurts.

764
00:35:12,757 --> 00:35:13,677
Don't worry, everyone,

765
00:35:14,038 --> 00:35:15,237
Master and Mr. He

766
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:16,237

767
00:35:17,038 --> 00:35:17,878
From now on,

768
00:35:18,038 --> 00:35:19,557

769
00:35:24,318 --> 00:35:25,158
Master.

770
00:35:25,677 --> 00:35:26,637
Did you make the congee?

771
00:35:27,197 --> 00:35:28,037
Yes.

772
00:35:28,438 --> 00:35:30,277
They haven't eaten for days.

773
00:35:30,798 --> 00:35:32,438
They have lost their virginity.

774
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:34,277
Letting them live is merciful.

775
00:35:34,518 --> 00:35:35,757
They're Rundu's shame!

776
00:35:35,837 --> 00:35:37,597
They don't deserve to eat the food.

777
00:35:38,518 --> 00:35:39,358
But

778
00:35:39,677 --> 00:35:41,557
they had no choice!

779
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:43,958
Master, please calm down.

780
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:45,117
Move away!

781
00:35:47,077 --> 00:35:47,917
Madam.

782
00:35:49,318 --> 00:35:50,757
Stop feeding them!

783
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:52,237
Stop it, you hear me!

784
00:35:56,318 --> 00:35:58,277
Throwing your weight around?

785
00:35:59,398 --> 00:36:00,878
Qi Luo is my concubine.

786
00:36:01,237 --> 00:36:02,077
She is shortsighted.

787
00:36:02,637 --> 00:36:03,717
I have the right

788
00:36:04,197 --> 00:36:05,037
to handle my woman.

789
00:36:06,557 --> 00:36:08,237
True, she's your concubine,

790
00:36:08,597 --> 00:36:09,958
but she's not a cargo

791
00:36:10,397 --> 00:36:11,237
or some object

792
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:12,757
to discard at will.

793
00:36:13,597 --> 00:36:14,998
She's a human being.

794
00:36:21,398 --> 00:36:22,238
And these women

795
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:24,358
are all Rundu's citizens.

796
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:26,157
Food belongs to all.

797
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:27,878
Why can't they eat?

798
00:36:28,717 --> 00:36:29,557
Li Kuang.

799
00:36:29,557 --> 00:36:30,438
If you

800
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,077
yell at the enemies

801
00:36:32,318 --> 00:36:33,197
or kill a few enemies,

802
00:36:33,557 --> 00:36:34,677
I'll respect your courage.

803
00:36:35,237 --> 00:36:36,518
But you're now

804
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:38,997
yelling at helpless women.

805
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:40,838
That's cowardice!

806
00:36:41,438 --> 00:36:42,278
You...

807
00:36:53,518 --> 00:36:54,358
Careful.

808
00:36:55,757 --> 00:36:56,597
Qi Luo.

809
00:36:56,838 --> 00:36:57,678
Are you okay?

810
00:36:58,318 --> 00:36:59,318
Thank you.

811
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:09,158
Thank you.

812
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:12,238
Thank you.

813
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,848
(This is)

814
00:37:14,848 --> 00:37:16,358
(tragic reality in this city.)

815
00:37:16,597 --> 00:37:17,437
Thank you.

816
00:37:17,478 --> 00:37:19,237
(We must strategize quickly)

817
00:37:19,717 --> 00:37:20,757
(to repel the enemies.)
