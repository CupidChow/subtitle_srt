=Episode 19=

23
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,910
Good morning.

24
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:48,670
Commander Xiao.

25
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,590
Miss He.

26
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,150
Let's have breakfast together.

27
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,660
Please.

28
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,830
Actually,

29
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,950
I've known for a while

30
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,670
you're not my elder brother's son.

31
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,030
Your act

32
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,150
was quite convincing.

33
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,670
Since Her Highness knew

34
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,870
you came to Jiyang

35
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,030
and yet did nothing,

36
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,270
she must have her plans.

37
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,390
In that case,

38
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,510
I had to play the fool.

39
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,030
You're a master of disguise.

40
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:20,950
I'm impressed.

41
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,190
To become Princess Mengji's right hand,

42
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,310
you must be

43
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,150
exceptionally clever.

44
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,270
Not as astute as you.

45
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,310
Let's have breakfast together.

46
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,420
Please.

47
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,390
Mr. Chu.

48
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,990
Mr. He, good morning.

49
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,830
Good morning.

50
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,910
But now I should call you Miss He.

51
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,630
You're still mistaken.

52
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,030
Currently,

53
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,310
you should call her Mrs. Qiao.

54
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,630
We have a visit to make, right?

55
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,550
Let's go.

56
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,150
Go.

57
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,710
Don't miss the time.

58
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,480
Mr. Chu.

59
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,470
I'll take my leave.

60
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,230
Speak your mind.

61
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,830
How did you know

62
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,630
I was visiting an elder?

63
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,070
You dressed formally this morning,

64
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,150
obviously to meet someone.

65
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,550
In all of Jiyang,

66
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,750
the only one worthy of such formality

67
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,230
would be your master.

68
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,310
My master once told me

69
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,590
that if needed,

70
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,950
I could find him in Jiyang.

71
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,430
I assumed

72
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,790
he was merely enjoying nature

73
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,790
but never imagined

74
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,350
there was a hidden story.

75
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,990
What story?

76
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,270
If it's hidden,

77
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,910
it can't be revealed.

78
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,270
Commander,

79
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,110
please don't press me.

80
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,070
Fine.

81
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,870
I don't care to know.

82
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:29,950
Thank you.

83
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,090
Thank you.

84
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,670
Thank you, Master.

85
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:49,950
Master Yunlin.

86
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,070
When did you arrive here?

87
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,590
Around each Water God Festival,

88
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,790
I return to Jiyang City.

89
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,270
This time,

90
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,030
I discovered Wutuo spies

91
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,030
disguised as civilians.

92
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,150
So,

93
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,590
I tracked them secretly

94
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:08,870
and indeed,

95
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,470
these Wutuo spies

96
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,950
used the festival crowds

97
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,670
to kidnap the young princess

98
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,510
to blackmail Princess Mengji.

99
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,630
The kidnapping

100
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,470
is just the first step.

101
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,430
Now, Wutuo agents

102
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,990
move freely through Jiyang,

103
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,070
like water eroding stone.

104
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,470
This was long planned.

105
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:28,870
Her Highness

106
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,750
dislikes

107
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,710
our interference

108
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,230
but has enhanced

109
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,230
security checks.

110
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,110
Let's hope it helps.

111
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,590
It feels like a storm
is brewing in Jiyang City.

112
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,550
Something major approaches.

113
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,270
You continue.

114
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,430
I need fresh air.

115
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,630
Ask what you wish.

116
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,310
Master.

117
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,470
Did you stay in Jiyang

118
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,630
for Princess Mengji?

119
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,750
Or is there another reason?

120
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,910
Even if she weren't Princess Mengji,

121
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,510
I won't stand idly by

122
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,590
and see the people

123
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,510
in Jiyang suffer.

124
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,470
Isn't it the same between you

125
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,670
and General Fengyun?

126
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,670
You're right.

127
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,150
I was small-minded.

128
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,830
But Master,

129
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,190
you...

130
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,550
Do you truly have no wish to see

131
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,150
Princess Mengji again?

132
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,150
You have much work to attend to.

133
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,630
I won't keep you longer.

134
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,830
Your master

135
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,670
seems burdened.

136
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,470
Even you noticed.

137
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,510
I don't know

138
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,630
Master Yunlin well,

139
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,170
but

140
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,630
this melody clearly reveals deep sorrow.

141
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,710
You truly are a master of music.

142
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,550
People may conceal truths,

143
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,990
but instruments never lie.

144
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,350
If I recall correctly,

145
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,110
Princess Mengji also played

146
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,030
this melody before?

147
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,110
They truly share a profound connection.

148
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,060
(Peaceful Land)

149
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,370
Commander,

150
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:15,950
Mr. Cui needs you

151
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,070
for urgent matters.

152
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,950
I'll take my leave.

153
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:20,930
And you?

154
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,910
You should return.

155
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,150
I'll walk around

156
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,190
and secretly inspect

157
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,070
the defenses.

158
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,350
(South Gate)

159
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,060
Next.

160
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,570
Go.

161
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:38,720
Next.

162
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:42,390
Next.

163
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,390
Next.

164
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,280
Go.

165
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,280
Go.

166
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,970
Go.

167
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,590
Princess Mengji is decisive.

168
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,830
A masterful defender.

169
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,140
Next.

170
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,070
I truly hope Jiyang City

171
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,790
can maintain this peace

172
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,830
and harmony forever.

173
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,230
Mr. Chu?

174
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,190
Why is it you?

175
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,470
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:49,830
I startled you?

177
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,010
It's nothing.

178
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,470
These are turbulent times.

179
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,910
Caution is only natural.

180
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,230
Please don't take offense.

181
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,430
Actually,

182
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,950
I want to apologize to you.

183
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,350
Apologize?

184
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,750
Why?

185
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,750
Last time, it was I who invited you

186
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,310
to admire the moon over Mount Baiyue.

187
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,790
But urgent matters arose,

188
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,750
and I left.

189
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,030
Nothing.

190
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,310
Don't take it seriously.

191
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,150
Moreover,

192
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,190
I did gain something else that night.

193
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:21,950
You hold no grudge

194
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,430
due to your magnanimity.

195
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,990
I cannot pretend

196
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,790
it never happened.

197
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,710
I must apologize.

198
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,060
By the way,

199
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,270
let me give you a gift, Miss He.

200
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,480
What?

201
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,190
Last time we met,

202
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,630
I noticed

203
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,830
you wore a purple whip

204
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,710
at your waist.

205
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:39,990
By chance,

206
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,990
I obtained this tassel.

207
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,470
I think it suits you perfectly.

208
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,550
Try it on.

209
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,870
See if it's better.

210
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,070
Mr. Chu,

211
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,390
I can't accept it.

212
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,350
Forget it.

213
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,470
Besides,

214
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,750
this tassel appears

215
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,830
quite valuable.

216
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,110
You call me Mr. Chu.

217
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,270
We're friends.

218
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,110
Between friends,

219
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,510
exchanging gifts is natural.

220
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,270
Besides,

221
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,910
this tassel isn't costly,

222
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,230
so feel no obligation.

223
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,030
Okay.

224
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,790
I'll accept it.

225
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,110
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

226
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,910
Perfect match.

227
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,190
In return,

228
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,110
I should give you something, Mr. Chu.

229
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,030
- Sir.
- Miss.

230
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,390
Which is the priciest one

231
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:36,910
here?

232
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,790
The floral basket.

233
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,950
Would you like one?

234
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,070
Yes, give me one.

235
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:40,710
Alright.

236
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,310
May I draw it myself?

237
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,350
Certainly.

238
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,150
Here you go.

239
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,670
Done.

240
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,550
How's this?

241
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,670
Do you like it?

242
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,270
Zilan

243
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,510
means fragrant orchid.

244
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,950
The person who named you

245
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,910
loved you certainly.

246
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,470
They surely wished you noble virtues

247
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,390
and a good future,

248
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,910
so you got this elegant name.

249
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:01,820
This is

250
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,030
my reciprocal gift.

251
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:03,910
Mr. Chu,

252
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,430
don't mock my clumsy handwriting.

253
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,670
How could I?

254
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,710
I'm deeply honored.

255
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,110
Burn him!

256
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,390
- Burn him!
- Burn him!

257
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:23,830
Mr. Chu.

258
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,470
Mr. Chu.

259
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,670
It's okay.

260
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,110
Are you

261
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,910
afraid of fire?

262
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,270
Thank goodness

263
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,590
this isn't ruined.

264
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,270
(Mengji Mansion)

265
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,470
Jiyang's defenses

266
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,750
remain well-fortified.

267
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,510
Let's hope so.

268
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:02,990
Commander.

269
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,430
Commander.

270
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,590
Where are you going?

271
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,310
Just walking.

272
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,990
Then I'll join you.

273
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,190
This is a gift from Mr. Chu.

274
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,910
Miss He also gave me a gift.

275
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,910
I like it very much.

276
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,710
She once sent me osmanthus candies,

277
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,350
a whole handful,

278
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,190
more than I could eat.

279
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,470
The characters "Zilan"
on this sugar painting

280
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,150
were written by Miss He herself.

281
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,470
This food is fragile.

282
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,790
You should keep it carefully

283
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,030
in case you

284
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,870
end up with nothing.

285
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,070
Thank you for the advice.

286
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,870
I'll preserve it with utmost care.

287
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,070
If you both enjoy sweets so much,

288
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,750
I'll buy more in the future.

289
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,150
Commander.

290
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,990
Several crucial granaries

291
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:22,670
are ablaze.

292
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,790
Very fiercely.

293
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,110
It's the Wutuo's doing.

294
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,270
Assist Mr. Cui

295
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,990
in it.

296
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:29,440
Yes.

297
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,390
Let's discuss it

298
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,510
with Princess Mengji.

299
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:34,980
Agreed.

300
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,910
Fire! The granary's on fire!

301
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,310
It's the Wutuo people.

302
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,750
They've made their move.

303
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,590
Quite the spectacle.

304
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,310
Those Wutuo people

305
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,910
grow more audacious by the day.

306
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,870
Doesn't this situation feel

307
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,790
all too familiar?

308
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,510
Mingshui

309
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:16,590
and Que City

310
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,070
both witnessed similar things.

311
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,710
The Wutuo people

312
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,150
breached the defenses easily

313
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,270
and launched attacks.

314
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,750
This time, Chancellor Xu aided them.

315
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,190
As for the previous two...

316
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,110
After this,

317
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,070
Xiao Jue won't let this slide.

318
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,190
Go take a look.

319
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,830
Skip the formalities.

320
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,150
You've come.

321
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,470
Lou,

322
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,310
they're your life savers.

323
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,470
Have you forgotten

324
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,270
your manners?

325
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,630
How could you act like this?

326
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:32,550
Commander Xiao.

327
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,270
I was just about to see you.

328
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:35,630
As you observed,

329
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,630
Wutuo is watching hungrily.

330
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,350
The situation in Jiyang City

331
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,590
grows more dire by the day.

332
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,630
Though I've dispatched troops

333
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,030
and increased security,

334
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,190
the Wutuo people

335
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,630
are moving faster.

336
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,870
How many men

337
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,350
are stationed here?

338
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,230
Under 20,000.

339
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,350
We've captured

340
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,830
some Wutuo infiltrators,

341
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,070
but it won't turn the tide.

342
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,790
Wutuo has already launched its attack.

343
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,790
This will be a bitter struggle.

344
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,950
Though Jiyang lacks manpower,

345
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,310
we'll never retreat.

346
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,190
I'll hold my position here

347
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:11,950
and stand with Jiyang

348
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,630
to the last breath.

349
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,030
I'd like

350
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,430
to offer my assistance.

351
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,790
Leaving your post at Yezhou

352
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,230
is a breach of military law.

353
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,790
Commanding troops now

354
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,070
would bring

355
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,910
graver consequences.

356
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,710
Do you truly

357
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,110
risk such repercussions

358
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,310
for Jiyang's sake?

359
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,590
As a Wei general,

360
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,990
it's my duty

361
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,790
to protect the people.

362
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,110
I'll contribute my efforts, too.

363
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,290
Good.

364
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,030
From this moment,

365
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,990
all Jiyang troops

366
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,790
will obey Commander Xiao's orders.

367
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,910
Our people's safety

368
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,910
rests in your hands, Commander.

369
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,390
I'll spare no effort

370
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,230
to defend Jiyang to the last.

371
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,430
Your Highness,

372
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,630
the war looms imminent.

373
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:41,790
Perhaps

374
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,830
the young princess

375
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,110
should be sent away.

376
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,030
I'm staying here.

377
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,470
I remain with Mother

378
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,350
and our people

379
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,230
no matter what.

380
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:00,550
So be it.

381
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,750
You'll stay by my side, Lou.

382
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,950
I'll keep you safe,

383
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,350
whatever the cost.

384
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:30,910
(Self-Revealing Virtue)

385
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,110
The troops here in Jiyang

386
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,550
are far too few.

387
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,150
And they lack recent combat experience.

388
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,430
You show true leadership.

389
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,510
Unflinching in crisis.

390
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,870
Aren't you

391
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,830
aspiring to be a female general?

392
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:47,990
20,000 men.

393
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,390
Far better than that

394
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,190
in Que City.

395
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,270
Whether 20,000

396
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,230
or 2,000,

397
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,870
when enemies are outside,

398
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,630
we fight to the death.

399
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,670
Prove those words true.

400
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,750
These 20,000 men

401
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,790
will follow your command.

402
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,270
Wise choice, Commander.

403
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,110
None could lead but me.

404
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,340
Thrust.

405
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:19,810
Stab.

406
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,460
Down. Chop.

407
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,270
After years without combat,

408
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,710
they look slack.

409
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,990
Such bold claims.

410
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,990
You make our army

411
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,190
sound like brittle clay.

412
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,070
Just a mere woman.

413
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,470
How can you teach us men

414
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,430
battle tactics?

415
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,550
You're gambling

416
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,230
with our lives.

417
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,730
Well?

418
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,110
Care to test me?

419
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,710
Don't waste time.

420
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,790
All ten of you

421
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,750
attack her at once.

422
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,310
You mock us?

423
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,830
I would like to see

424
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,550
how you'll face ten opponents alone.

425
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:57,890
Commander.

426
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,230
You honor me excessively.

427
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,790
Do you know?

428
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,950
I hear

429
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,590
Mrs. Qiao is challenging
the Jiyang army single-handedly

430
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,030
at the training field.

431
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:14,870
Is she crazy?

432
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,870
Any more challengers?

433
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,630
- Great!
- Great!

434
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,750
- Great!
- Great!

435
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,390
Now you see

436
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,310
how formidable she is.

437
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,310
Truly the best of Yezhou Garrison.

438
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,270
This scene

439
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,990
looks eerily familiar to me.

440
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,720
Here.

441
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,400
Thank you.

442
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,270
- Amazing!
- Awesome!

443
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,230
Yes.

444
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,230
Incredible!

445
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,830
Didn't I tell you the truth?

446
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,070
Women

447
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,110
are never inferior to men.

448
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,590
Through the ages,

449
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:06,830
people have claimed

450
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,070
women belong at embroidery frames

451
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,150
and housewifery.

452
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,470
But must we women

453
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,350
be confined to domestic roles

454
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,710
or limited to needlework?

455
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,030
We can write and fight.

456
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,910
We can write literary masterpieces.

457
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,750
We can charge into battle

458
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:21,990
and earn glory.

459
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,390
We're not just waiting to be saved.

460
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,310
We can save ourselves.

461
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,070
Of course

462
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,310
I won't force you

463
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,270
to fight on battlefields.

464
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,870
But beyond combat,

465
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,430
you can do other things.

466
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,590
Even the tiniest dust

467
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,270
can fill mountains and seas.

468
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,030
The faintest glow

469
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,750
can rival the sun and moon.

470
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,710
I prided myself on noble birth

471
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,990
but remained trapped in stagnation.

472
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,830
I can sell unwanted jewels

473
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,390
to buy

474
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,950
weapons and provisions.

475
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,670
- Me too!
- Me too!

476
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,410
I'll donate.

477
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,710
Those who are poor can learn

478
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,510
medicine from us.

479
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,230
Countless soldiers will need care

480
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:07,910
later.

481
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,670
Rich or poor, all can learn.

482
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,150
Well?

483
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,390
Am I impressive?

484
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,110
You know why I let you

485
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:20,910
lead them?

486
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:21,830
Because

487
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,590
I'm unquestionably capable.

488
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,270
Miss He is so skilled

489
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,110
in martial arts.

490
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,470
She

491
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,310
always defies convention.

492
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,350
Young Master,

493
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:40,910
Princess Mengji began

494
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,590
evacuating the civilians today.

495
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,630
Shouldn't you join them?

496
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,310
My goal is unfinished.

497
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:47,790
How can I leave now?

498
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,310
But Jiyang is too dangerous.

499
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,830
Only by staying

500
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,230
can I uncover

501
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,390
Master's true intentions.

502
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:54,910
Yingxiang,

503
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,870
two paths lie before me.

504
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:57,830
Either

505
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,070
die in this city

506
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,030
or survive

507
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,670
to confirm my suspicions.

508
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,870
A life of complacency

509
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,950
would be meaningless

510
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,110
even if I return.

511
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,410
Understand?

512
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,510
Keep up.

513
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,030
Everyone, follow me.

514
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,760
Stay close.

515
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,870
Jiyang has become

516
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,110
half-deserted overnight.

517
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,470
Shops stand shuttered.

518
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,910
Only the able-bodied

519
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,190
and those strong enough

520
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,430
could flee.

521
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,790
The old, weak, and ill

522
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,430
can't even join the exodus.

523
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,470
Miss Song.

524
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:50,950
I know what you'll say.

525
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,390
Save your breath.

526
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,230
As a healer,

527
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,910
I won't abandon people

528
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,550
in crisis.

529
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,510
What are you thinking?

530
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,390
Don't you want me to leave?

531
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,230
Come on!

532
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,110
You haven't conceded defeat yet.

533
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,710
And you want to escape?

534
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,750
Cheng Lisu.

535
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,550
Besides,

536
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,390
you aim to heal the world

537
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,350
and reform medical texts.

538
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,230
No one should obstruct your path.

539
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,430
Cheng Lisu.

540
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,310
This time,

541
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,830
let's see who saves more.

542
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,590
It's also part of the contest.

543
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,390
If you lose,

544
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,630
you'll have to wash

545
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,550
my socks for a year.

546
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:29,990
You're destined to lose.

547
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,270
There won't be

548
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,590
many women for you to rescue

549
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,270
in combat.

550
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,350
I won't lose.

551
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,350
Then we'll see about that.

552
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,910
If the heavens don't favor us

553
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,550
on the day of battle,

554
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,150
what then?

555
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,990
Every inch of Jiyang's land

556
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,910
can become our burial ground.

557
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,990
This is the conviction

558
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,270
every soldier should possess.

559
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,990
Rather die with shattered wings

560
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,510
than endure separation
amidst the clouds.

561
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,270
Today,

562
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,870
the weather is clear.

563
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,390
What's your plan?

564
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,790
They've suddenly forced their march.

565
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,870
If we want to win with fewer people,

566
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,990
holding fortresses is crucial.

567
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:23,840
Go.

568
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:31,950
Be careful.

569
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:35,430
Hurry.

570
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,350
Go.

571
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:37,790
Let's go there.

572
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:38,990
Hurry.

573
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,110
Go.

574
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,070
Young Master,

575
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,710
as the Military Inspector,

576
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,230
you've done more than enough.

577
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,390
You can't fight.

578
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,430
For your safety,

579
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,550
please leave the city.

580
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:50,670
Leave this to me.

581
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,230
I took on from Her Highness

582
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,310
the evacuation

583
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,590
and resettlement.

584
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,950
I must finish it.

585
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,830
I can't abandon the people

586
00:28:58,990 --> 00:28:59,750
to save myself.

587
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,030
Moreover,

588
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,350
Chai Anxi isn't found.

589
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,550
If I leave alone,

590
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,030
how will I face my master?

591
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,510
But...

592
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,310
I've decided.

593
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:08,860
Over here.

594
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,230
Move aside!

595
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,030
Thank you, sir.

596
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,310
Anyone else disrupting order

597
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,390
will be executed.

598
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,190
Are you alright, sir?

599
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,510
I'm fine. I'm fine.

600
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,430
Thank you.

601
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,230
There's an empty house

602
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,470
ahead sheltering

603
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,670
lost elders and children.

604
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:41,710
You can

605
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,510
stay there temporarily

606
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,270
for shelter.

607
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,030
Okay, thank you.

608
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,270
Yingxiang.

609
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,350
Escort the elder.

610
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,070
Yes.

611
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:51,830
Thank you.

612
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,470
Mr. Chu.

613
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,630
Mr. Chu.

614
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:32,870
Are you alright?

615
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:35,670
I'm fine.

616
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,510
Thank you.

617
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,830
When I bought the sugar painting,

618
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,950
I noticed you seemed

619
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,190
uneasy around fire.

620
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,510
Mr. Chu, are you afraid of fire?

621
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,670
(Smoke him out to cleanse)

622
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,430
(bad luck!)

623
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,310
- Yes!
- Yes!

624
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:49,910
Do it.

625
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,190
Smoke him out.

626
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,510
Your mother eloped.

627
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,310
Serves you right.

628
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,910
You fatherless boy.

629
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,030
Illegitimate.

630
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,270
Don't insult my mother!

631
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,350
Mother.

632
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,870
Mother.

633
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,510
It's okay.

634
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,670
Mother.

635
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,470
Mr. Chu.

636
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:13,550
Mr. Chu.

637
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,470
I'm sorry.

638
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,550
I shouldn't ask you.

639
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,020
It's okay.

640
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:19,790
Thank you.

641
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,510
Mr. Chu.

642
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,030
You've already thanked me.

643
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,390
I just remembered it.

644
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,590
I have a garment

645
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,190
made of mermaid silk fabric.

646
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,430
The merchant claimed

647
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,830
clothes crafted from this material

648
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:31,990
are swordproof

649
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,110
and resistant to fire.

650
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:34,630
I'll have it sent

651
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,590
to you later, Mr. Chu.

652
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,430
This way,

653
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,550
you won't fear flames.

654
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,990
It's settled then.

655
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,430
Mr. Chu, I'll go patrol.

656
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,470
Stay cautious.

657
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,550
Be careful.

658
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:47,870
Let's go.

659
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,630
We just got news.

660
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:57,910
The Wutuo Army

661
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:58,710
suddenly sped up.

662
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,470
They're 20 li

663
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,150
outside

664
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,230
the south gate.

665
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,270
I suspect

666
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,750
they've got news

667
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,230
about you being in Jiyang.

668
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,950
They've always feared you.

669
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,550
Knowing you're here,

670
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:10,910
they'll surely exploit

671
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,270
the lack of coordination

672
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,510
between you and the troops

673
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,750
to strike swiftly.

674
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,830
For us to overcome their numbers,

675
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:19,230
speed will be crucial.

676
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,320
So,

677
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,750
this is our opportunity.

678
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:22,670
True.

679
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,310
Our troops' morale is high.

680
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,950
Civilians are encouraged.

681
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,070
Both united

682
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:27,950
to strike.

683
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,710
This is our moment to repel Wutuo.

684
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,110
But

685
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,510
Jiyang's limited forces

686
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,910
remain our critical weakness.

687
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,110
We need unusual ideas

688
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,510
to reverse our fortunes.

689
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,230
This time,

690
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:38,830
the Wutuo commander

691
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:39,870
is Huyate.

692
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,750
Courageous in combat

693
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,310
but stubbornly self-assured,

694
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,430
with limited skill

695
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,630
in formations.

696
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,310
Disrupting his formation

697
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,830
is key to victory.

698
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,470
I've heard of Huyate.

699
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,310
His heavy-armored troops

700
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,230
are tough.

701
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,990
But it decides the battle.

702
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,310
You seem well-informed

703
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,390
about Huyate.

704
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:05,430
Commander,

705
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,590
after all,

706
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,870
I aspire to be a general.

707
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,910
It's my duty

708
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,910
to study

709
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:11,950
potential adversaries.

710
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,220
See?

711
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,910
This knowledge proves useful now.

712
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,030
Commander.

713
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:18,560
Commander.

714
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,550
During the evacuation today,

715
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:21,710
my men stationed

716
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,710
at checkpoints

717
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:23,710
didn't find

718
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,550
Chai Anxi.

719
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:25,870
He likely

720
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,070
hasn't fled the city yet.

721
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,590
In that case,

722
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,990
he probably plans

723
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:30,950
to escape

724
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,030
once the battle begins.

725
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:32,950
But by then,

726
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,230
the city will be surrounded,

727
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:35,910
and we'll be stretched too thin.

728
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:38,990
Continue the checks.

729
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,230
Stay vigilant.

730
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,470
If war truly breaks out,

731
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:44,700
our priority

732
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,230
is to defend Jiyang.

733
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,650
Yes.

734
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,310
(I've guarded)

735
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:16,030
(this city for over two decades.)

736
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,150
(This time,)

737
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,830
(I will surely protect it again.)

738
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,030
(Master.)

739
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,310
The Mengji throne

740
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,990
doesn't require marriage alliances.

741
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,230
Through generations
of rulers' diligence,

742
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,310
they won over the people.

743
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,950
Diligent governance is crucial,

744
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,790
but through history,

745
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,670
no woman has ever inherited the throne.

746
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,510
Hongjin is Prince Mengji's sole child.

747
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,590
Legitimate.

748
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,070
(Taoist Yunji)
A brave and smart woman

749
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,190
rivals any man.

750
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,910
These are just your personal views.

751
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,190
Though laws never stipulated

752
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,910
only men can inherit the throne,

753
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,670
some traditions

754
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,830
have become unspoken rules

755
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,270
in the public's mind.

756
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,990
Her gender alone

757
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,150
gives opponents ground to challenge her.

758
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,550
Hongjin will prove to the world

759
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,390
she surpasses her ancestors.

760
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,230
I'll stand by her side.

761
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,550
The nobles in Jiyang

762
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,110
won't grant her that time.

763
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:46,470
Now,

764
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,710
only marriage

765
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,270
can stabilize the situation

766
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,710
and her position swiftly.

767
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,830
I believe

768
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,550
heaven never seals all doors.

769
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:55,830
We can defy our destiny.

770
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,950
You two might challenge fate,

771
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,470
but victory demands sacrifice.

772
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,630
Don't tell me

773
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,910
you fear no hardship.

774
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:05,790
The suffering

775
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,430
won't just burden you two.

776
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,270
When turmoil erupts,

777
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,510
countless Jiyang citizens

778
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,390
will inevitably

779
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:15,470
endure hardships because of you.

780
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,230

Is it important?
