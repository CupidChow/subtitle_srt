1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let me run to the next level

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Snow falls as I turn around

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll go through ups and downs

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hold my hand and I'll live for love

5
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,000
As the song of the sky

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

7
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Episode 16

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Isn't it He Yan?

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
No, Instructor Chen

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Brother He is the first place

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The first place is great, right?

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Do what you should do

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What's the rush?

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I tell you

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The number of people who can win the game

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
is measured by the overall score

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's just one of the rounds

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
They are not good at it

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Come, drink

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Drink

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You just want to join 97th Battalion?

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Only if I join 97th Battalion

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
can I make contributions

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and be a general

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You are so anxious

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and you are so shameless

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't have a family

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What I want to do

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
is just to prove myself

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Lei Hou is your defeated general

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Huai Xin chooses him over you

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That's his loss

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Drink

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Come, drink

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Come

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,440
Let's get married.

39
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,720
I want to get drunk and rest.

40
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
Here.

41
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,760
I'm happy today. Let's drink.

42
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Sit and eat.

43
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,720
Xiaoju, you're too much!

44
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
What did you call me?

45
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,560
Xiaoju.

46
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,960
Are you stupid?

47
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,800
You don't even know your own name.

48
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,160
Xiaoju, do you know who I am?

49
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,640
Who are you?

50
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,360
Me?

51
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,960
My attitude has improved.

52
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,600
I don't change!

53
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,840
Me?

54
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,600
I'm the No. 1all in this state!

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,880
he wants to approach me

56
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,200
Just give me the wine

57
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,760
He wants away

58
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He wants away

59
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,220
Go

60
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,880
How much did they drink?

61
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,360
You should hurry back

62
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,780
Wine

63
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,600
B Sylvanas

64
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You're going back?

65
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,600
You haven't told me

66
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,360
why you didn't choose me to join the nine-legged battalion.

67
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,280
I'm the best in the whole of Yezhou.

68
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,120
I'm a good person.

69
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,880
You

70
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,400
have no taste.

71
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,240
Actually, I know why you didn't choose me to join the nine-legged battalion.

72
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,920
That's because you suspect that

73
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,880
there's a spy.

74
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,760
But you've tried so many times to find out.

75
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,880
You know I'm not...

76
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,480
Lei Hou.

77
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,520
It's Lei Hou.

78
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,200
How is it?

79
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,960
Am I smart?

80
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,680
You're smart indeed.

81
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,560
But smart people

82
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,680
usually don't have good results.

83
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,720
How come?

84
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,760
I'm telling you.

85
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,080
One day, Yan and I

86
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,840
will be on the top of the list.

87
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,520
Yayou.

88
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,160
He Yan.

89
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,160
Put it back.

90
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,080
He Yan, put it back.

91
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,120
Su Long,

92
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,720
don't be mad at me.

93
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,840
I'll show you my sword.

94
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,880
Slaughter her.

95
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,400
Yes.

96
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
Shう.

97
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,160
I know it's my fault.

98
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,040
I don't really have to…

99
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,920
Xiaojue, do you like me?

100
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Brother Fei Nu, you are...

101
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
I'm going to send the dinner to Du Du.

102
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,440
What about you?

103
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,720
The banquet is not over yet.

104
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
Why are you here?

105
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,240
I just got selected into the Nine Seasons Camp.

106
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,160
I wanted to thank Du Du in person.

107
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,240
But I didn't expect Du Du to...

108
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,440
I didn't expect that he would be so kind.

109
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,560
I'm sorry.

110
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,520
Du Du...

111
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,360
You must not like me.

112
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,560
Otherwise,

113
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,400
why didn't you let me join the Nine Seasons Camp?

114
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,600
Let go.

115
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,240
You are too much.

116
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,400
You are so ungrateful.

117
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,040
You are so disappointing.

118
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,400
Tell me.

119
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,880
In terms of appearance,

120
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,360
in terms of body,

121
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,560
in terms of height,

122
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,920
what's wrong with me?

123
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,320
Tell me.

124
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,680
What's wrong with me?

125
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,520
Do you have height?

126
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,080
Even if it's about the relationship between you and me,

127
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,800
shouldn't you

128
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,000
increase the number of people?

129
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,760
What relationship between you and me?

130
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
You are just a bad omen.

131
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,120
I...

132
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,200
I...

133
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,200
I want to prove it to you.

134
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,240
I...

135
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,080
Again.

136
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,880
Let go.

137
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,520
Good.

138
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,400
You...

139
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,040
You...

140
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,960
My lord.

141
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,680
If you don't increase the number of people,

142
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,240
I'll...

143
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,640
I'll...

144
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,960
What are you going to do?

145
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,880
Your Majesty, lend me your hands.

146
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,560
Alright.

147
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,720
Train me.

148
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,320
Keep me waiting.

149
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,720
He...

150
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,120
I think

151
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,600
Brother He

152
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,000
you're sleepingzzo

153
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,560
not bad

154
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,680
Duoduo's tent

155
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,760
correct

156
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,880
To hide the truth

157
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,520
HuanJin

158
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,360
went to me last night

159
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,880
What's wrong?

160
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,280
Do you remember anything?

161
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,440
Dad.

162
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,280
It seems that you remember it.

163
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,280
Did the governor say how to deal with me?

164
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,440
No.

165
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,040
But he doesn't look very good.

166
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,280
Oh, no.

167
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,760
Oh, no.

168
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,120
Don't talk about going to the nine-man camp.

169
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,520
I'm afraid I can't stay in the Yezhou camp.

170
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,080
What should I do?

171
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,280
That's not necessarily.

172
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,240
Look.

173
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,160
You used his most real sword

174
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,320
to cut his favorite sword.

175
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,280
And he didn't cut you.

176
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,760
He even let you sleep on the bed.

177
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,120
Think about it.

178
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,360
Why does he treat you so well?

179
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,680
He must have seen

180
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
that you are very special.

181
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,600
Very...

182
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,960
Very special?

183
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,320
Did I expose your true identity?

184
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,320
Did I expose my true identity?

185
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,160
You are an indispensable talent.

186
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,840
That's why he is so proud of you.

187
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Am I wrong?

188
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,960
Come on.

189
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,320
Xiaoju.

190
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,600
Do you know who I am?

191
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,320
I am the No.1 in Yezhou.

192
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,320
I'm a very good person.

193
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,560
You...

194
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,720
You have no taste.

195
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,080
Duoduo.

196
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,920
Don't be angry.

197
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,480
I...

198
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,440
I'll show you.

199
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,520
I should apologize to Duoduo

200
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,360
for my misbehavior.

201
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,120
He is not a man of light feet.

202
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,720
He must be a man of great power.

203
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,100
Bring the city's

204
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,100
holy water.

205
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:01,600
Yes.

206
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,100
Yes.

207
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,600
Yes.

208
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,100
Yes.

209
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,600
Yes.

210
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,100
Yes.

211
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,600
Yes.

212
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,100
Yes.

213
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,600
Yes.

214
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,100
Yes.

215
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,600
Yes.

216
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,100
Yes.

217
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,600
Yes.

218
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,100
Yes.

219
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,600
Yes.

220
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,100
Yes.

221
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,600
Yes.

222
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,580
Yes.

223
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,280
Duoduo.

224
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,080
You can't take the wine as the truth.

225
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,880
Or you'll be in trouble.

226
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,480
It's a big deal.

227
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,280
Duoduo.

228
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,080
Or I'll use my three years of military service

229
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,680
to compensate your love.

230
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,680
You have a lot of money.

231
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,560
Can you let me join the wine and drink?

232
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,560
Brother He.

233
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,360
Why are you here alone?

234
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,560
I'm afraid you want to practice more.

235
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,080
I'm sorry.

236
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
You're sorry?

237
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,160
Kneel on this?

238
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,960
Yezhou is so big.

239
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,760
Thank you, brother.

240
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,760
If I go alone,

241
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,760
I'm afraid I'll get lost.

242
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
Miss.

243
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,240
Don't be a Hejiang woman in your next life.

244
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,640
It's him.

245
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,440
Brother He.

246
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,440
Did you choose the weapon?

247
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,360
I've not even had a chance.

248
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,240
I don't even know how can I face such an Queen.

249
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,960
Brother.

250
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,080
Just now,

251
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,960
who was with you just now?

252
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,800
They are from the thief,

253
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,000
to give our Duoduo the Juping butter.

254
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,320
Thank you.

255
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,120
vial of swarming with並es.

256
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,400
What do you want to do?

257
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,960
Yezhou Commandery is short of provisions and provisions.

258
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,920
I'm afraid that

259
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,120
I'll invite Yezhou Commandery's

260
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,160
Commander Xiao Jue to come here

261
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,520
to discuss this matter.

262
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,480
I also heard that

263
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,000
Cheng Lisu is in Yezhou Commandery.

264
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,360
I haven't seen Cheng Xianzhi for many years.

265
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,720
I'm worried about him.

266
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,480
I hope that Commander will go with Cheng Xianzhi

267
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,360
to Sun Xiangfu, the county magistrate of Yezhou.

268
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,720
I asked you to come here to discuss official affairs.

269
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,760
Why did you invite me?

270
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,960
We don't need to go there.

271
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,440
You really don't remember?

272
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,440
Sun Xiangfu?

273
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,480
When I entered the capital,

274
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,720
his wife made the marriage arrangement for you.

275
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,200
Oh no.

276
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,240
He asked me to go there

277
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,480
and then he tied me down

278
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,000
and sent me back to the capital to get married.

279
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,040
This...

280
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,200
Huai Xin.

281
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,760
Uncle.

282
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,720
You have to save me.

283
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,840
You can't just

284
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,120
look at your best friend

285
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,160
and your lovely nephew

286
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,720
and jump into the fire pit.

287
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,240
Is it that exaggerated?

288
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,640
Very exaggerated.

289
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,000
You know that

290
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,160
I have a crush on that Song's daughter.

291
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,080
She always

292
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,840
does something strange.

293
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,440
I will be treated as a test subject

294
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,480
and then die slowly.

295
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,760
Instead,

296
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,600
I'd rather die now.

297
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,400
Wait.

298
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:40,720
Uncle.

299
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,640
I knew you wouldn't just die.

300
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,400
We're so close.

301
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,080
What...

302
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,200
What are you doing?

303
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,320
Yin Qiu's blood is like mud.

304
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,400
I'll lend it to you.

305
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,080
You...

306
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,920
You must be kidding.

307
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,120
Uncle.

308
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,880
You're not really

309
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,120
going to die, are you?

310
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,640
Didn't you say you'd end it?

311
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,680
I...

312
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,800
I was just kidding.

313
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,240
Mr. Cheng.

314
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,920
I heard someone

315
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,560
sent a invitation to Duoduo.

316
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,760
Brother He.

317
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,200
Don't be so stingy.

318
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,480
Remember to

319
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,280
give me more money.

320
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,400
Mr. Cheng, what's wrong with you?

321
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,280
I'm going to be a guest

322
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,440
with Huai Jin

323
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,960
at the county magistrate's house.

324
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,600
That's a tiger's den.

325
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,480
Tiger's den?

326
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,240
You're not going to be a guest?

327
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,760
I'm not going to be a guest.

328
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,280
I'm going to be a guest.

329
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,760
You're not going to be a guest.

330
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,200
I'm not going to be a guest.

331
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,480
I'm not going to be a guest.

332
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,800
Tiger's den?

333
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,440
Why are you afraid of Duoduo?

334
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,720
Is there anyone

335
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
more powerful

336
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,480
in the county magistrate's house?

337
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,240
Sun Xiangfu is more scary than a tiger.

338
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,440
Her wife is the matchmaker who set me up.

339
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,560
I'm afraid

340
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,640
Xiao Jue can't even protect me this time.

341
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,560
So Duoduo went to Yezhou

342
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,160
to talk about marriage with you.

343
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,120
No.

344
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,840
Huai Jin went to talk about official affairs.

345
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,520
I'm the only one who wants to go through this.

346
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,320
Duoduo went to talk about official affairs?

347
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,560
What's the matter?

348
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,760
Yezhou's county magistrate

349
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,120
wants Duoduo to go to see him personally.

350
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,760
He's so shameless.

351
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,920
No.

352
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,000
Huai Jin went to talk about military provisions and expenses.

353
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,080
I was...

354
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,440
No, Brother He.

355
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,320
Why do you always mention Huai Jin?

356
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,720
I'm the one who's unlucky.

357
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,920
Not him.

358
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,560
Childe Cheng.

359
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,880
I'm thinking that Duoduo is very capable.

360
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,680
Since I can't count on him,

361
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,920
I'll help you figure out a way.

362
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,840
Let's go.

363
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,800
Let me help you figure it out.

364
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,360
Duoduo.

365
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,040
About military provisions and expenses,

366
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,240
Sun Xiangfu has been trying to find a reason to push it away.

367
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,560
But at this critical moment,

368
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,760
he suddenly wants to go there.

369
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,840
There must be a trap.

370
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,080
I think it's obviously a red-lake banquet.

371
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,480
How about we go there?

372
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,160
I'm not going.

373
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,040
They won't give up.

374
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,200
It's hard to prevent a case if you're well-known.

375
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,000
It's better to take the initiative.

376
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,360
Besides,

377
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,880
Sun Xiangfu still owes me

378
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,480
military provisions for Yezhou.

379
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,240
Duoduo.

380
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,720
I just received the news.

381
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,520
It said that

382
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,200
Chuzhao, the military inspector, is coming to Yezhou.

383
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,720
You should know him.

384
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,280
He's the 19th general of Qingyuan.

385
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,080
He's the favorite student of Xu Jingfu.

386
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,040
He's been working for Xu Jingfu all these years.

387
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,600
According to the investigation,

388
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,520
he just came back from Que City.

389
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,440
What's the time?

390
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,760
Your reputation is damaged in the battle of Que City.

391
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,400
I don't know if it's related to him.

392
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,840
I don't know what he'll do

393
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,000
in Yezhou this time.

394
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,080
I've dealt with Chuzhao.

395
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,760
He was not doing well in Chu's family in the early years.

396
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,400
Until he got the title of official,

397
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,960
the Chu family changed his mind about him.

398
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,160
Now he's under the influence of Xu Jingfu.

399
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,240
He must be

400
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,560
trying to take advantage of Xu Jingfu's situation.

401
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,600
No matter what he's up to,

402
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,680
he's working for Xu Jingfu.

403
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,680
It's so coincidental that he came back from Que City.

404
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,600
The rumor should be related to him.

405
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,240
You should be careful

406
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,960
when you go to Yezhou this time.

407
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,680
Yes.

408
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,760
Duoduo.

409
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,240
The situation is so bad.

410
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,840
Mr. Cheng doesn't know martial arts.

411
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,560
I'm afraid it's not appropriate for him to go with us.

412
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,680
He Yan is the only one who will go to the city.

413
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,520
What's wrong?

414
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,240
Nothing.

415
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,960
Duoduo, don't you suspect He Yan's identity?

416
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,000
Why do you want to take him with you?

417
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,600
I'm worried about him.

418
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,520
Since he's so active,

419
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,240
let him go.

420
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,360
He's good at martial arts.

421
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,960
Then we can have a competition

422
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,520
at the red gate banquet.

423
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,200
Sun Xiangfu has been holding

424
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,080
the military expenses of Yezhou Commandery.

425
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,760
But he suddenly invited Xiao Jue to the mansion for a talk.

426
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,400
He Rufei must be planning something

427
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,320
with Sun Xiangfu.

428
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,240
And Yezhou Commandery is the problem.

429
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,320
Even Xiao Jue...

430
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,760
I must figure it out

431
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,600
whether it's for the sake of

432
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,520
Yezhou Commandery, Xiao Jue or myself.

433
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,080
Duoduo.

434
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,000
What's the matter?

435
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,640
Duoduo.

436
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,000
I was drunk last night and offended you.

437
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,320
It's my fault.

438
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,360
But Duoduo,

439
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,920
you don't have to look at me like that.

440
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,040
I've already figured out a way

441
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,400
to atone for my sin.

442
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,920
So you decided to go to Yezhou for Cheng Lisu

443
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,600
to atone for your sin?

444
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,040
Actually, it's not the whole thing.

445
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,720
Besides worrying about you,

446
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,040
I also want to atone for my sin.

447
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,120
I'm afraid I can't help you.

448
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,720
I'm afraid I can't help you.

449
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,160
Besides worrying about you,

450
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,880
I also want to atone for myself.

451
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,480
For yourself?

452
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,960
I want to enter the Jiuxi Camp

453
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,080
to make a contribution.

454
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,240
If this trip

455
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,120
can make Duoduo

456
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,160
change her mind about me,

457
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,200
next time,

458
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,480
I will definitely be the one

459
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,640
who enters the Jiuxi Camp.

460
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,320
Such a good opportunity is in front of me.

461
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,720
I will definitely take it.

462
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,200
Okay.

463
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,200
We'll wait and see.

464
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,400
Let's see how you make me change my mind.

465
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,120
And at last,

466
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,520
I can go to the Jiuxi Camp

467
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,480
to make a lot of dirty fits.

468
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,120
So I think

469
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,680
you should be on good gallOP.

470
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,640
Mr. Cheng,

471
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,240
Hello.

472
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,680
I'm a friend of Engine.

473
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,480
I have been waiting for you.

474
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,520
Duoduo,

475
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,040
get everybody ready.

476
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,440
Get ready.

477
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,360
Hurry up.

478
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,360
Good morning.

479
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,360
I am Cheng Lisu.

480
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,760
I am from the capital.

481
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,960
I like eating chicken with sesame seeds.

482
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,360
I hate eating rice porridge.

483
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,360
I can't eat peanuts.

484
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,360
It's the most joyful time.

485
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,360
I have to take a bath every day.

486
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,760
Not bad.

487
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,160
You are well-trained.

488
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,360
You are really a man who relies on clothes and horses.

489
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,760
This suits you better.

490
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,360
Brother He,

491
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,760
your style today

492
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,960
is almost like me.

493
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,760
You flatter me.

494
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,560
Duoduo, how about it?

495
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,760
Do I look

496
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,360
elegant and beautiful

497
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,960
in this dress?

498
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,360
You are

499
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,960
even more beautiful than Cheng Lisu.

500
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,160
Who said that?

501
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
It's almost the same.

502
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
When are you leaving?

503
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,160
Go away.

504
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,760
Young Master,

505
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,360
Ding Yi and Sun Xiangfu

506
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,360
have already met.

507
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,560
They have invited Xiao Jue

508
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,160
to the invitation letter from Yezhou.

509
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,160
It should have been handed over to Xiao Jue.

510
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:32,960
Okay.

511
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,560
Where is the Sun family?

512
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,960
They are all here.

513
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,560
What did you find out?

514
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,160
They have already

515
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,360
sent a man to kill Sun Xiangfu

516
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,960
as you ordered.

517
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,760
Sun Ling is a good-looking man.

518
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
He is unable to do anything

519
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,560
in Yezhou City

520
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,560
because of his father.

521
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,760
The people in Yezhou City

522
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
are too bold to say anything.

523
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,160
What's the matter with Sun Xiangfu's position in the mountain?

524
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,960
He is a father.

525
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,360
He will be implicated by his son.

526
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,560
Young Master,

527
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,560
if so,

528
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,560
shouldn't we

529
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,760
go to Sun Mansion?

530
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,560
The stage is set.

531
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,560
The performers

532
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,760
should be here soon.

533
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,960
We will leave when they arrive.

534
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,960
If we miss them,

535
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,760
it will be a pity.

536
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,560
Sirs,

537
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,360
this way, please.

538
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,160
Come on.

539
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,360
Sir, please.

540
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,160
Duoduo.

541
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,560
Uncle,

542
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,560
why don't we go to Sun Mansion?

543
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,560
No hurry.

544
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,560
Sir,

545
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,960
how many rooms do you want?

546
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,760
I want a room with a good view.

547
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,160
A room with a good view?

548
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,360
How many rooms do we want?

549
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,360
Three.

550
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,560
Two.

551
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,360
You and I will live in one room.

552
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,560
Why should I live in one room with you?

553
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,560
Because...

554
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,360
Uncle,

555
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,960
I am your nephew.

556
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
You won't even

557
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,560
pay more for a room, will you?

558
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,560
Three.

559
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,560
Okay.

560
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,560
You...

561
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,560
You are not allowed to leave the room tonight.

562
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,760
Huo Jin.

563
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,760
Coming.

564
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,960
Do you have

565
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,360
Koumo fat chicken?

566
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,160
Yes.

567
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,360
Give me one.

568
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,960
Uncle, you know that

569
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,760
I like Koumo fat chicken the most.

570
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,760
One Koumo fat chicken,

571
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,160
