(The Commander is too upright)

28
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:50,064
(to visit such a place.)

(It's my chance to shake him off.)

00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,714
(Wanhua Pavilion)

31
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:10,465
Mr. Zhang.

32
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:11,745
We've been waiting.

33
00:04:14,025 --> 00:04:14,704
Come on.

34
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:15,745
Hurry up.

35
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:17,305
Upstairs, please.

36
00:04:17,305 --> 00:04:17,944
Alright.

37
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,784
Mr. Wang.

38
00:04:22,784 --> 00:04:23,905
I've missed you so much.

39
00:04:24,145 --> 00:04:25,664
The girls are ready.

40
00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:27,664
Have a great time.

41
00:04:27,905 --> 00:04:28,705
Alright.

42
00:04:30,585 --> 00:04:31,905
Serve our young master well.

43
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:33,025
Alright.

44
00:04:33,544 --> 00:04:34,705
Do come again.

45
00:04:34,864 --> 00:04:36,864
Let me keep you company.

46
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:38,585
I haven't seen you in ages.

47
00:04:40,065 --> 00:04:42,465
Have fun. Drink plenty.

48
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,145
Alright.

49
00:04:47,424 --> 00:04:49,264
Young master, long time no see.

50
00:04:49,544 --> 00:04:50,416
Yunyan.

51
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:53,040
Entertain the young master.

52
00:04:53,145 --> 00:04:53,784
No problem.

53
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:55,304
You look new here.

54
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:56,528
Is this your first visit?

55
00:04:57,104 --> 00:04:57,680
Yeah.

56
00:04:57,784 --> 00:04:58,640
New experience.

57
00:04:58,784 --> 00:04:59,664
Please show me around.

58
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:01,465
We have the best girls here.

59
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:02,864
Check out the new ones.

60
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:03,625
Miss.

61
00:05:03,864 --> 00:05:05,664
Shall we go upstairs?

62
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:08,176
What's the rush, young master?

63
00:05:09,145 --> 00:05:10,184
The night is short.

64
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:11,784
Let's not waste it.

65
00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:12,705
Alright.

66
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:14,705
Young master.

67
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:15,784
Isn't that

68
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:17,065
the fortune teller we met

69
00:05:17,065 --> 00:05:18,065
returning from Que City?

70
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:19,625
Why is he here?

71
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:20,585
Here.

72
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:21,664
See?

73
00:05:22,025 --> 00:05:23,145
Isn't she nice?

74
00:05:32,344 --> 00:05:33,104
Bro,

75
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:35,465
fate led us to meet.

76
00:05:35,984 --> 00:05:37,664
I know some fortune-telling.

77
00:05:38,465 --> 00:05:39,304
Would you like

78
00:05:39,585 --> 00:05:40,880
to get a divination?

79
00:05:57,145 --> 00:05:58,128
Bro.

80
00:05:58,544 --> 00:05:59,945
Have you recently

81
00:06:00,304 --> 00:06:01,505
suffered bloodshed?

82
00:06:04,304 --> 00:06:05,585
Looks like I'm right.

83
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,120
Just a minor injury.

84
00:06:07,224 --> 00:06:07,784
No big deal.

85
00:06:09,265 --> 00:06:10,032
Bro.

86
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:11,224
That's not right.

87
00:06:11,544 --> 00:06:12,825
Minor injury matters too.

88
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,304
It may cause serious trouble

89
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:16,065
if left untreated.

90
00:06:16,505 --> 00:06:17,625
For example,

91
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,344
it may hinder your moves in battles.

92
00:06:19,344 --> 00:06:20,025
That

93
00:06:20,304 --> 00:06:22,352
could be fatal.

94
00:06:23,145 --> 00:06:23,984
But don't worry

95
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:24,864
too much, bro.

96
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:26,184
Consider yourself lucky.

97
00:06:26,184 --> 00:06:26,864
You met me today.

98
00:06:27,424 --> 00:06:29,104
I have some medicine here.

99
00:06:33,265 --> 00:06:33,905
This elixir

100
00:06:34,265 --> 00:06:35,472
stops the pain and bleeding.

101
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:37,552
Take this

102
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:38,744
to strengthen vitality.

103
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,344
Thank you, my friend.

104
00:06:47,856 --> 00:06:48,505
No problem.

105
00:06:49,505 --> 00:06:50,145
Yingxiang.

106
00:06:59,145 --> 00:06:59,952
Farewell.

107
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:02,145
Sir.

108
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:02,905
Coming.

109
00:07:03,104 --> 00:07:03,705
Check please.

110
00:07:04,585 --> 00:07:05,625
Five coins in total.

111
00:07:06,664 --> 00:07:07,385
Okay, thanks.

112
00:07:08,224 --> 00:07:08,912
Young master.

113
00:07:09,424 --> 00:07:11,224
Does he really know divination?

114
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:13,344
I highly doubt it.

115
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:15,224
He sniffed it out.

116
00:07:15,824 --> 00:07:16,528
Let's go.

117
00:07:23,864 --> 00:07:24,688
He might be

118
00:07:25,505 --> 00:07:26,984
telling fortunes here.

119
00:07:30,705 --> 00:07:31,984
Isn't it nice here?

120
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:32,705
Look around.

121
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:33,680
And

122
00:07:33,825 --> 00:07:34,544
look at them.

123
00:07:34,905 --> 00:07:36,848
They're new girls.

124
00:07:36,848 --> 00:07:37,385
Come on.

125
00:07:37,385 --> 00:07:38,505
Let me show you my room.

126
00:07:47,585 --> 00:07:48,304
Miss.

127
00:07:48,544 --> 00:07:49,664
What's that room for?

128
00:07:50,385 --> 00:07:51,224
That room?

129
00:07:51,224 --> 00:07:52,784
That's where dancers practice.

130
00:07:53,104 --> 00:07:54,505
Then they perform

131
00:07:54,505 --> 00:07:55,664
at noble banquets.

132
00:07:56,344 --> 00:07:57,328
Young master.

133
00:07:57,328 --> 00:07:58,800
The night is too short.

134
00:08:00,016 --> 00:08:01,025
Hurry.

135
00:08:02,705 --> 00:08:03,385
Come on.

136
00:08:03,664 --> 00:08:04,304
Hurry.

137
00:08:04,544 --> 00:08:05,385
Wait here.

138
00:08:05,505 --> 00:08:06,344
I'll fetch wine.

139
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:08,984
Just a moment.

140
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:16,505
(Dancers?)

141
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:17,825
(Perform?)

142
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:54,584
Hurry.

143
00:09:00,184 --> 00:09:01,505
(Good thing I wore this veil.)

144
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:03,064
(He doesn't recognize me.)

145
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:06,464
Why hasn't it started yet?

146
00:09:06,704 --> 00:09:08,025
I've waited forever.

147
00:09:08,145 --> 00:09:08,905
When will it start?

148
00:09:08,905 --> 00:09:10,784
I came just to see Miss Sun.

149
00:09:10,865 --> 00:09:11,584
Start already.

150
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,584
Will you start?

151
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:14,424
Take care, Mr. Zhang.

152
00:09:15,225 --> 00:09:16,345
What should I do?

153
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:23,584
Miss Sun isn't feeling well.

154
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,625
She hasn't changed yet.

155
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:27,745
Go on the stage

156
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:29,704
and buy us some time.

157
00:09:29,704 --> 00:09:31,024
Hurry.

158
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:34,865
Nice figure.

159
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:36,745
Are you going to sing?

160
00:09:37,865 --> 00:09:38,905
What are you waiting for?

161
00:09:39,105 --> 00:09:39,704
Dance.

162
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,424
Just dance.

163
00:09:43,944 --> 00:09:44,745
Just a second.

164
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:45,265
Dance.

165
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:46,105
Just a second.

166
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:48,985
Come on, we're waiting.

167
00:09:49,704 --> 00:09:50,800
Start dancing.

168
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:52,385
The carriage is ready.

169
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,145
Let's go.

170
00:09:56,144 --> 00:09:56,688
(Never mind.)

171
00:09:57,184 --> 00:09:58,625
(Let me get through this first)

172
00:09:59,184 --> 00:10:00,265
(to avoid being caught.)

173
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,105
(Since Ding Yi)

174
00:10:02,505 --> 00:10:04,424
(is disguised as Sun Xiangfu's servant,)

175
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:06,304
(I'll see what to do)

176
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:07,505
(in the Sun Mansion.)

177
00:10:10,704 --> 00:10:11,312
Young master.

178
00:10:11,664 --> 00:10:12,816
May I borrow your sword?

179
00:10:30,544 --> 00:10:31,505
Bravo.

180
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:34,505
Nice!

181
00:10:34,512 --> 00:10:35,152
Nice!

182
00:10:35,704 --> 00:10:36,345
Nice!

183
00:10:36,745 --> 00:10:37,385
Nice!

184
00:10:37,424 --> 00:10:38,304
Sword dance.

185
00:10:38,944 --> 00:10:40,064
Alright!

186
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:49,664
Isn't that nice?

187
00:10:50,064 --> 00:10:52,184
Bravo!

188
00:11:01,824 --> 00:11:03,304
Bravo.

189
00:11:21,704 --> 00:11:23,304
A woman disguised as a man.

190
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:25,704
Interesting.

191
00:11:25,905 --> 00:11:26,544
Nice!

192
00:11:30,985 --> 00:11:32,385
Nice!

193
00:11:40,584 --> 00:11:41,184
(Commander?)

194
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:42,985
(He actually came in.)

195
00:11:47,544 --> 00:11:48,145
Step down.

196
00:11:50,345 --> 00:11:51,304
Off the stage.

197
00:12:13,584 --> 00:12:14,184
(Oh no.)

198
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:15,225
(I lost the rhythm.)

199
00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:57,184
Bravo!

200
00:12:57,505 --> 00:12:58,105
Bravo!

201
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:18,184
Nice!

202
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:56,184
Nice!

203
00:13:56,505 --> 00:13:57,625
Nice!

204
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,625
Thank you for the flower.

205
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:08,824
A flower

206
00:14:09,424 --> 00:14:10,584
for a beauty.

207
00:14:17,225 --> 00:14:18,064
(It's him.)

208
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:48,064
Bravo.

209
00:15:00,745 --> 00:15:01,584
(This woman)

210
00:15:02,345 --> 00:15:03,784
(has sheer audacity.)

211
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:06,745
How was that?

212
00:15:07,745 --> 00:15:08,464
Wasn't it great?

213
00:15:08,544 --> 00:15:09,296
(That was close.)

214
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:10,664
(I knew)

215
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:12,464
(Xiao Jue wouldn't)

216
00:15:12,865 --> 00:15:14,385
(recognize me in this attire.)

217
00:15:15,184 --> 00:15:15,625
Mr. Chu.

218
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:17,064
Long time no see.

219
00:15:17,745 --> 00:15:18,745
Masterful flute work.

220
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,784
Thank you for your praise.

221
00:15:22,985 --> 00:15:23,856
But

222
00:15:24,385 --> 00:15:26,064
I didn't expect to see you here.

223
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:27,784
What a small world.

224
00:15:29,544 --> 00:15:30,064
This way.

225
00:15:34,544 --> 00:15:35,664
What are you doing?

226
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:36,944
Let me go.

227
00:15:36,944 --> 00:15:38,145
Hurry. Bring her back.

228
00:15:38,664 --> 00:15:39,145
Hurry.

229
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:40,304
Bring her back.

230
00:15:40,544 --> 00:15:41,064
Let me go.

231
00:15:41,464 --> 00:15:42,704
Catch her! Hurry.

232
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:43,505
Bring her back.

233
00:15:43,784 --> 00:15:44,944
Don't let her get away.

234
00:15:45,225 --> 00:15:45,985
Grab her.

235
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:46,865
Hurry.

236
00:15:47,225 --> 00:15:48,184
Get her back.

237
00:15:48,225 --> 00:15:49,145
Don't let her get away.

238
00:15:49,345 --> 00:15:50,225
Tie her up.

239
00:15:50,944 --> 00:15:51,584
Tie her up.

240
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:52,544
Somebody help.

241
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:55,025
Young Master Sun's men

242
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:55,944
will be here shortly.

243
00:15:56,345 --> 00:15:57,145
Do her makeup.

244
00:15:57,385 --> 00:15:57,905
Hurry up.

245
00:16:04,385 --> 00:16:05,505
Drink some more.

246
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:07,265
It's been a year

247
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:09,105
since we parted in Yaojing.

248
00:16:10,225 --> 00:16:11,464
Now we met in Yezhou.

249
00:16:12,385 --> 00:16:14,184
The court knows
that Yezhou Garrison faces

250
00:16:14,184 --> 00:16:15,064
supply shortages.

251
00:16:15,304 --> 00:16:15,865
I came

252
00:16:16,145 --> 00:16:17,865
by decree to resolve this matter.

253
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,145
So the inspector they sent

254
00:16:20,704 --> 00:16:21,385
is you.

255
00:16:21,745 --> 00:16:22,985
Thank you for your hard work.

256
00:16:24,064 --> 00:16:24,985
We should thank you

257
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:25,745
for training

258
00:16:26,105 --> 00:16:27,265
the recruits in Yezhou.

259
00:16:27,865 --> 00:16:28,625
I'm just holding

260
00:16:28,865 --> 00:16:29,985
a nominal position.

261
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:31,625
Besides,

262
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,184
I don't know anyone in Yezhou

263
00:16:33,584 --> 00:16:34,865
to do my job as the inspector.

264
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:36,345
I hardly deserve

265
00:16:36,824 --> 00:16:37,745
any praise.

266
00:16:49,025 --> 00:16:49,584
Oh, right.

267
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:52,464
Have you met Magistrate Sun yet?

268
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,704
My nephew insisted

269
00:16:55,304 --> 00:16:56,505
on touring Yezhou.

270
00:16:57,064 --> 00:16:58,664
So I came a few days earlier.

271
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:00,544
Could you please

272
00:17:00,865 --> 00:17:01,584
keep it a secret?

273
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:02,800
What a coincidence.

274
00:17:03,145 --> 00:17:03,745
I also came

275
00:17:03,784 --> 00:17:04,865
a few days earlier

276
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,265
to learn a few things about Yezhou.

277
00:17:10,224 --> 00:17:10,905
No business talks

278
00:17:11,345 --> 00:17:12,385
since we're here for fun.

279
00:17:13,024 --> 00:17:14,464
I've long heard of the snowscapes

280
00:17:14,704 --> 00:17:16,184
of Yezhou Garrison.

281
00:17:17,024 --> 00:17:18,464
Extend your stay and you'll surely

282
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:20,145
get to see it.

283
00:17:23,105 --> 00:17:23,984
Do visit again.

284
00:17:24,424 --> 00:17:25,184
Upstairs, please.

285
00:17:26,785 --> 00:17:28,105
Leaving so soon, Mr. Wang.

286
00:17:43,825 --> 00:17:44,385
Young master,

287
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:45,704
don't you like

288
00:17:45,744 --> 00:17:46,545
any of the girls?

289
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:47,984
You're leaving so soon.

290
00:17:48,585 --> 00:17:49,385
Young master.

291
00:17:51,744 --> 00:17:52,865
(He Yan crosses paths)

292
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,865
(with Chu Zhao.)

293
00:17:54,424 --> 00:17:55,944
(And he's so focused on He Yan.)

294
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:57,264
(Could it be)

295
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:58,944
(that they know each other?)

296
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,385
It's getting late.

297
00:18:01,984 --> 00:18:02,825
I have to go.

298
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,224
Presumably,

299
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,424
our next meeting

300
00:18:05,944 --> 00:18:07,145
will be at the Sun Mansion.

301
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:13,625
Take care.

302
00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:15,105
Let's go.

303
00:19:33,065 --> 00:19:34,184
Sorry, I'm starving.

304
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:35,944
This isn't my usual manner.

305
00:19:37,464 --> 00:19:38,576
It's fine. Just eat.

306
00:19:38,865 --> 00:19:39,545
Talk over food.

307
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:42,160
Where were we?

308
00:19:43,145 --> 00:19:43,888
Wedding escape.

309
00:19:44,664 --> 00:19:45,664
Yeah, wedding escape.

310
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:47,145
My name is Song Taotao.

311
00:19:47,264 --> 00:19:48,184
I ran away from home.

312
00:19:48,504 --> 00:19:49,984
I was passing through Yezhou

313
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:51,424
when I got abducted.

314
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,585
Thankfully, you saved me.

315
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,024
(Song Taotao?)

316
00:19:57,944 --> 00:19:58,984
He Yan is studying

317
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,024
at Xianchang Academy now.

318
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:03,744
Nobody has discovered the truth.

319
00:20:04,024 --> 00:20:04,785
Good to know.

320
00:20:05,744 --> 00:20:07,345
He Yan is 15 now.

321
00:20:08,504 --> 00:20:10,305
We must arrange for his marriage

322
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:12,785
before he reaches 18.

323
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,384
(Marriage?)

324
00:20:15,065 --> 00:20:16,385
(I'm not a man.)

325
00:20:16,704 --> 00:20:17,625
(How do I get married?)

326
00:20:18,424 --> 00:20:19,264
(Once I'm engaged,)

327
00:20:19,704 --> 00:20:21,105
(who will be "He Rufei"?)

328
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:23,585
The daughter
of the Chief Imperial Physician,

329
00:20:23,585 --> 00:20:24,424
Song Taotao.

330
00:20:25,065 --> 00:20:26,944
She seems like a perfect match

331
00:20:27,024 --> 00:20:28,065
for He Yan.

332
00:20:28,424 --> 00:20:30,264
We can form a marital alliance.

333
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:32,704
(I will never)

334
00:20:32,704 --> 00:20:34,024
(get engaged to Miss Song.)

335
00:20:34,545 --> 00:20:35,305
(Not only that,)

336
00:20:35,865 --> 00:20:36,585
(I will never)

337
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:37,585
(marry any woman,)

338
00:20:37,984 --> 00:20:39,385
(so as not to ruin her life.)

339
00:20:44,585 --> 00:20:46,024
(Isn't she the one who almost)

340
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:47,504
(became my fiancée?)

341
00:20:48,345 --> 00:20:49,545
(Fate truly connects us.)

342
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:58,464
Why are you looking at me like that?

343
00:20:59,464 --> 00:21:00,264
It's nothing.

344
00:21:00,585 --> 00:21:02,545
So, who abducted you?

345
00:21:04,504 --> 00:21:05,264
I don't know.

346
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,305
I ran into him the moment I arrived.

347
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,905
His lackeys called him

348
00:21:10,464 --> 00:21:11,440
Young Master Sun.

349
00:21:11,825 --> 00:21:12,825
He called me pretty,

350
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:14,424
asked me to be his mistress,

351
00:21:14,504 --> 00:21:15,464
and tried to assault me.

352
00:21:15,865 --> 00:21:16,944
So I stabbed his arm

353
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,385
with my hairpin.

354
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:22,024
You may look frail,

355
00:21:22,184 --> 00:21:23,704
but you have a fiery temper.

356
00:21:24,305 --> 00:21:25,184
But I didn't expect

357
00:21:25,264 --> 00:21:26,065
that I couldn't

358
00:21:26,224 --> 00:21:26,905
get rid of them.

359
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:28,305
I could have run away

360
00:21:28,424 --> 00:21:29,625
if I had been careful.

361
00:21:30,545 --> 00:21:31,744
It sounds like you know

362
00:21:31,905 --> 00:21:33,424
how to defend yourself.

363
00:21:37,424 --> 00:21:38,504
What are those?

364
00:21:39,704 --> 00:21:41,168
This is datura

365
00:21:41,464 --> 00:21:43,065
for sedation and anesthesia.

366
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,120
This is arisaema

367
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:48,944
for calming convulsions.

368
00:21:52,825 --> 00:21:54,345
This withered flower

369
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:55,305
is rhododendron molle

370
00:21:55,504 --> 00:21:57,024
for blood circulation and pain relief.

371
00:21:59,704 --> 00:22:00,905
These sliced pieces

372
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:01,625
are aconite.

373
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:03,785
- They dispel cold and relieve pain.
- Wait.

374
00:22:04,744 --> 00:22:05,616
All these herbs

375
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,145
are poisonous, right?

376
00:22:07,704 --> 00:22:08,264
Yeah.

377
00:22:08,585 --> 00:22:09,224
Maybe

378
00:22:09,345 --> 00:22:10,625
they'll come in handy later.

379
00:22:12,184 --> 00:22:13,504
Not really. Put them away.

380
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:20,785
Anyway,

381
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:22,024
this "Young Master Sun"

382
00:22:23,224 --> 00:22:25,024
could be the son of Yezhou Magistrate

383
00:22:25,305 --> 00:22:26,464
Sun Xiangfu.

384
00:22:27,224 --> 00:22:28,744
That complicates things.

385
00:22:34,264 --> 00:22:35,024
Sir,

386
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,145
I'm Song Taotao.

387
00:22:36,545 --> 00:22:37,385
I'll repay

388
00:22:37,545 --> 00:22:38,305
your kindness

389
00:22:38,305 --> 00:22:39,408
when I return to Yaojing.

390
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:40,345
Hero,

391
00:22:40,504 --> 00:22:41,464
what's your name?

392
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:43,184
I'm flattered.

393
00:22:43,545 --> 00:22:44,305
My name...

394
00:22:46,944 --> 00:22:47,944
My name is Cheng...

395
00:22:56,224 --> 00:22:56,785
Hurry.

396
00:23:01,744 --> 00:23:03,264
They just won't leave us alone.

397
00:23:10,585 --> 00:23:11,568
I underestimated them.

398
00:23:11,785 --> 00:23:12,785
You're from the capital

399
00:23:12,785 --> 00:23:13,865
and don't sound local.

400
00:23:14,105 --> 00:23:14,984
They must have guessed

401
00:23:15,105 --> 00:23:16,224
we'd come to an inn.

402
00:23:17,385 --> 00:23:17,944
Forget it.

403
00:23:18,504 --> 00:23:19,865
We're on their turf, after all.

404
00:23:20,145 --> 00:23:20,625
Stay here.

405
00:23:20,785 --> 00:23:21,545
I'll handle it.

406
00:23:23,305 --> 00:23:24,264
In that case,

407
00:23:24,545 --> 00:23:26,065
it's kind of my turf, too.

408
00:23:26,785 --> 00:23:27,625
I'm quite capable.

409
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:30,944
You're not local, either.

410
00:23:31,264 --> 00:23:32,145
Helping me may get you

411
00:23:32,184 --> 00:23:33,385
into serious trouble.

412
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:34,825
Others didn't dare help me.

413
00:23:35,145 --> 00:23:36,345
Why are you helping me?

414
00:23:40,184 --> 00:23:40,785
Because

415
00:23:41,464 --> 00:23:42,385
you're a woman.

416
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:45,984
(And so am I.)

417
00:23:54,305 --> 00:23:55,105
Hurry up.

418
00:23:55,385 --> 00:23:55,984
Move.

419
00:23:56,345 --> 00:23:56,905
Hurry up.

420
00:23:57,264 --> 00:23:57,785
Go.

421
00:23:58,105 --> 00:23:58,744
And you.

422
00:23:59,152 --> 00:23:59,744
Move.

423
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,305
Hurry.

424
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:00,865
Out.

425
00:24:02,704 --> 00:24:03,224
Move.

426
00:24:03,424 --> 00:24:04,024
Go.

427
00:24:04,224 --> 00:24:04,825
(Sun Ling, son of Sun Xiangfu)
Out.

428
00:24:05,024 --> 00:24:05,625
Stop dawdling.

429
00:24:05,865 --> 00:24:06,385
Faster.

430
00:24:06,424 --> 00:24:07,224
Get going.

431
00:24:07,385 --> 00:24:07,952
Go.

432
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:09,184
Hurry up.

433
00:24:10,385 --> 00:24:11,224
Why is that door

434
00:24:11,345 --> 00:24:12,145
closed?

435
00:24:13,145 --> 00:24:13,944
Let's check it.

436
00:24:15,264 --> 00:24:15,944
Let's go.

437
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:16,704
Let's go.

438
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:23,088
Open the door.

439
00:24:23,345 --> 00:24:23,865
Open up.

440
00:24:24,345 --> 00:24:25,264
Coming.

441
00:24:25,785 --> 00:24:27,065
Hurry up.

442
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:29,944
It's so late. What's going on?

443
00:24:30,664 --> 00:24:31,704
Step aside.

444
00:24:34,865 --> 00:24:36,224
Search thoroughly.

445
00:24:38,464 --> 00:24:39,184
Young master.

446
00:24:39,264 --> 00:24:39,984
Put this on.

447
00:24:40,184 --> 00:24:40,825
It's chilly.

448
00:24:41,865 --> 00:24:42,825
Search carefully.

449
00:24:54,865 --> 00:24:55,504
Mr. Sun.

450
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:56,385
She's not here.

451
00:24:59,105 --> 00:24:59,625
It's so late.

452
00:24:59,744 --> 00:25:00,625
Who said you could

453
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:01,808
just barge into my room?

454
00:25:02,744 --> 00:25:03,704
This is ridiculous.

455
00:25:04,224 --> 00:25:05,385
Do I need permission

456
00:25:05,385 --> 00:25:06,128
to go anywhere

457
00:25:06,128 --> 00:25:07,345
in Yezhou?

458
00:25:09,184 --> 00:25:10,585
Keep your eyes sharp.

459
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:12,905
Inspect them.

460
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,264
Understood.

461
00:25:26,704 --> 00:25:27,408
Looking similar.

462
00:25:30,184 --> 00:25:31,545
What's your name?

463
00:25:32,305 --> 00:25:33,464
Cheng Lisu.

464
00:25:38,545 --> 00:25:39,585
Raise your head.

465
00:25:43,664 --> 00:25:44,464
Hey, you.

466
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,785
Raise your head.

467
00:25:45,865 --> 00:25:46,625
Sir.

468
00:25:46,905 --> 00:25:48,184
Don't cross the line.

469
00:25:51,264 --> 00:25:52,016
So it turns out

470
00:25:52,345 --> 00:25:53,625
that the assassin who abducted

471
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:54,504
my concubine

472
00:25:55,105 --> 00:25:56,145
is you.

473
00:25:57,385 --> 00:25:58,256
Guards.

474
00:25:58,704 --> 00:25:59,865
Arrest

475
00:26:00,385 --> 00:26:01,264
both of them.

476
00:26:01,464 --> 00:26:02,065
Understood.

477
00:26:04,585 --> 00:26:05,264
It's fine.

478
00:26:06,504 --> 00:26:07,088
Move.

479
00:26:15,305 --> 00:26:16,080
Mr. Sun.

480
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,385
I suggest you

481
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:20,145
think twice before arresting me.

482
00:26:20,264 --> 00:26:21,040
Do you know

483
00:26:21,145 --> 00:26:21,944
who my uncle is?

484
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:23,464
- Who's your uncle?
- Who's your uncle?

485
00:26:25,385 --> 00:26:26,352
My uncle

486
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:28,744
is appointed by His Majesty

487
00:26:28,744 --> 00:26:29,785
as General Fengyun

488
00:26:30,825 --> 00:26:31,856
and Right Army Commander.

489
00:26:31,984 --> 00:26:32,785
Xiao Jue.

490
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:34,464
How about that?

491
00:26:34,585 --> 00:26:35,585
Still arresting me?

492
00:26:41,585 --> 00:26:42,825
Did you hear that?

493
00:26:43,504 --> 00:26:44,704
Who's his uncle again?

494
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:49,145
You brat.

495
00:26:50,065 --> 00:26:51,345
If Xiao Jue is your uncle,

496
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:52,504
get him here.

497
00:26:52,984 --> 00:26:54,024
He's your uncle. So what?

498
00:26:54,184 --> 00:26:54,865
So ridiculous.

499
00:26:55,145 --> 00:26:56,825
Today I'll make you beg

500
00:26:57,024 --> 00:26:58,264
for death

501
00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:00,145
in front of him.

502
00:27:03,305 --> 00:27:03,825
Really?

503
00:27:08,504 --> 00:27:09,424
Try your luck.

504
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:14,944
See?

505
00:27:15,145 --> 00:27:16,224
That's my uncle.

506
00:27:17,105 --> 00:27:17,744
Let go.

507
00:27:18,944 --> 00:27:19,856
Huaijin.

508
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:22,184
Come on, who are you?

509
00:27:23,664 --> 00:27:24,464
Didn't you hear?

510
00:27:31,744 --> 00:27:32,816
Has General Fengyun

511
00:27:33,305 --> 00:27:33,944
arrived?

512
00:27:34,024 --> 00:27:34,825
We haven't heard.

513
00:27:39,504 --> 00:27:40,704
How dare you fool

514
00:27:40,944 --> 00:27:42,464
falsely claim official titles?

515
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,376
You

516
00:27:43,464 --> 00:27:44,825
abducted my family member.

517
00:27:45,545 --> 00:27:47,184
You're courting death.

518
00:28:01,345 --> 00:28:02,704
Ouch.

519
00:28:03,704 --> 00:28:04,385
It hurts.

520
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:08,224
Ling.

521
00:28:08,704 --> 00:28:09,264
Ling.

522
00:28:09,984 --> 00:28:10,585
Father.

523
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:11,785
Who did this to you?

524
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,104
(Sun Xiangfu, Yezhou Magistrate)
Guards. He...

525
00:28:13,704 --> 00:28:14,224
Young master.

526
00:28:16,345 --> 00:28:16,976
Commander?

527
00:28:17,744 --> 00:28:18,352
Commander.

528
00:28:18,585 --> 00:28:19,905
I failed to welcome you

529
00:28:20,024 --> 00:28:20,585
properly.

530
00:28:20,664 --> 00:28:22,024
I beg for your forgiveness.

531
00:28:25,385 --> 00:28:27,024
Why is Magistrate Sun

532
00:28:27,065 --> 00:28:28,145
begging for forgiveness?

533
00:28:29,825 --> 00:28:31,385
Your son was quite domineering

534
00:28:31,385 --> 00:28:32,625
upstairs earlier.

535
00:28:33,224 --> 00:28:34,865
First, he tried to abduct my servant,

536
00:28:35,264 --> 00:28:36,785
then he threatened to kill me.

537
00:28:37,305 --> 00:28:38,105
He even said

538
00:28:38,305 --> 00:28:39,585
he'd make me beg for death

539
00:28:39,744 --> 00:28:40,744
in front of my uncle.

540
00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:41,545
W-What...

541
00:28:41,704 --> 00:28:43,024
You're begging for forgiveness?

542
00:28:43,825 --> 00:28:44,385
Seriously.

543
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:45,625
We're terrified.

544
00:28:46,105 --> 00:28:47,088
Right?

545
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:48,184
Uncle?

546
00:28:49,424 --> 00:28:51,264
Commander,
I failed to discipline my son.

547
00:28:51,345 --> 00:28:52,504
He didn't know who you were

548
00:28:52,504 --> 00:28:53,305
and offended you

549
00:28:53,305 --> 00:28:53,944
and...

550
00:28:54,785 --> 00:28:55,345
Cheng.

551
00:28:55,825 --> 00:28:56,664
Mr. Cheng.

552
00:28:57,224 --> 00:28:58,464
I sincerely...

553
00:28:58,625 --> 00:28:59,424
I-I...

554
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:00,585
Come here.

555
00:29:01,024 --> 00:29:01,664
Come here.

556
00:29:02,744 --> 00:29:03,385
Get over here.

557
00:29:04,545 --> 00:29:05,145
Lower.

558
00:29:06,585 --> 00:29:07,224
Lower.

559
00:29:08,145 --> 00:29:08,585
Father.

560
00:29:08,744 --> 00:29:09,552
He hit me.

561
00:29:10,744 --> 00:29:11,345
He hit you?

562
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:13,664
You should avenge me.

563
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:14,184
Avenge you?

564
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:15,545
I'll beat you to death.

565
00:29:15,825 --> 00:29:17,024
You're asking for this.

566
00:29:17,264 --> 00:29:18,385
You're asking for this.

567
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:19,744
Why are you hitting me?

568
00:29:19,865 --> 00:29:21,424
You're asking for this.

569
00:29:21,664 --> 00:29:22,264
You want me

570
00:29:22,585 --> 00:29:23,905
to avenge you?

571
00:29:24,464 --> 00:29:25,345
I don't even know

572
00:29:25,345 --> 00:29:26,264
if I'll survive this.

573
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:26,944
Avenge you?

574
00:29:27,345 --> 00:29:28,065
How about this?

575
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:29,184
I will

576
00:29:29,264 --> 00:29:30,545
break my son's legs

577
00:29:30,585 --> 00:29:31,264
as an apology.

578
00:29:31,464 --> 00:29:32,345
What do you think?

579
00:29:39,424 --> 00:29:40,905
My mother has aged.

580
00:29:41,024 --> 00:29:41,664
And this is

581
00:29:41,744 --> 00:29:42,545
my only son.

582
00:29:42,785 --> 00:29:43,704
If he dies,

583
00:29:43,984 --> 00:29:45,585
our family line ends with me.

584
00:29:46,145 --> 00:29:46,625
Please

585
00:29:46,984 --> 00:29:47,865
punish me instead

586
00:29:48,224 --> 00:29:49,545
and spare my son.

587
00:29:49,865 --> 00:29:50,264
Please.

588
00:29:51,984 --> 00:29:52,744
Mr. Sun.

589
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,424
Your son doesn't have to recognize me.

590
00:29:56,024 --> 00:29:57,865
But the inspector is on his way here.

591
00:29:58,184 --> 00:29:58,944
If your son

592
00:29:59,024 --> 00:30:00,184
mistakes the inspector

593
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:01,504
for an impostor,

594
00:30:02,024 --> 00:30:02,785
then he may

595
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:04,585
have to die for it.

596
00:30:04,825 --> 00:30:05,504
It won't happen.

597
00:30:05,744 --> 00:30:06,424
It won't happen.

598
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:07,545
I assure you.

599
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,264
Thank you, Commander.

600
00:30:31,785 --> 00:30:32,504
Get up.

601
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,184
Let's go.

602
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:34,184
Let's go.

603
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:38,320
Come back.

604
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,504
Where are you going?

605
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,560
This way.

606
00:30:40,704 --> 00:30:41,464
Let's go.

607
00:30:41,585 --> 00:30:42,224
Faster.

608
00:30:42,464 --> 00:30:43,224
Get moving.

609
00:30:43,865 --> 00:30:45,024
Hurry.

610
00:30:45,305 --> 00:30:46,464
Hurry.

611
00:30:46,785 --> 00:30:47,344
We're off.

612
00:31:07,545 --> 00:31:09,585
Sun Ling was abusing his power.

613
00:31:09,704 --> 00:31:10,585
What a disgrace.

614
00:31:11,264 --> 00:31:12,145
If I hadn't...

615
00:31:17,545 --> 00:31:18,145
Anyway,

616
00:31:18,424 --> 00:31:20,345
I ran into Miss Song on the street

617
00:31:20,385 --> 00:31:21,296
and brought her here.

618
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:28,208
I did this to promote

619
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:28,944
your reputation

620
00:31:28,944 --> 00:31:31,184
as a people's hero, Commander.

621
00:31:31,865 --> 00:31:32,704
I don't need that.

622
00:31:37,785 --> 00:31:38,504
I think

623
00:31:38,825 --> 00:31:40,385
we should take Miss Song

624
00:31:40,385 --> 00:31:40,944
with us.

625
00:31:41,385 --> 00:31:42,424
If she stays in Yezhou,

626
00:31:42,424 --> 00:31:44,065
Sun Ling will surely retaliate.

627
00:31:44,545 --> 00:31:45,264
You rescued her.

628
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:46,785
You'll handle it.

629
00:31:51,704 --> 00:31:52,585
Mr. Xiao.

630
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,320
I'm Song Taotao.

631
00:31:56,385 --> 00:31:57,105
Miss Song.

632
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:58,545
You know each other?

633
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:00,264
I'm engaged

634
00:32:00,424 --> 00:32:01,785
to Mr. Xiao...

635
00:32:02,424 --> 00:32:03,145
What?

636
00:32:04,944 --> 00:32:05,680
Mr. Xiao's nephew.

637
00:32:07,504 --> 00:32:08,264
Miss Song,

638
00:32:08,825 --> 00:32:10,385
don't leave sentences half-finished.

639
00:32:16,224 --> 00:32:16,825
Wait.

640
00:32:19,865 --> 00:32:20,504
Commander.

641
00:32:22,345 --> 00:32:23,568
How many nephews do you have?

642
00:32:27,184 --> 00:32:27,984
Wedding escape.

643
00:32:29,065 --> 00:32:29,825
Engagement.

644
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:34,105
Y-You're...

645
00:32:34,264 --> 00:32:35,585
You're Cheng Lisu's...

646
00:32:35,585 --> 00:32:37,305
I'm Cheng Lisu's so-called

647
00:32:37,704 --> 00:32:38,424
fiancée.

648
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:43,744
(I joined the army)

649
00:32:43,984 --> 00:32:44,976
(to escape marriage.)

650
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:46,744
(Then Song Taotao)

651
00:32:46,944 --> 00:32:48,385
(got engaged to Cheng Lisu.)

652
00:32:48,865 --> 00:32:50,825
(Both of them fled.)

653
00:32:51,385 --> 00:32:52,785
(How strange is fate.)

654
00:32:53,184 --> 00:32:54,345
(It's a cycle.)

655
00:32:54,744 --> 00:32:55,424
Mr. Xiao,

656
00:32:55,905 --> 00:32:56,625
can you take me

657
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:57,464
to Yezhou Garrison?

658
00:32:57,984 --> 00:32:59,345
I won't cause any trouble.

659
00:32:59,664 --> 00:33:00,785
Are you sure about that?

660
00:33:01,305 --> 00:33:02,184
Your fiancé

661
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:03,504
is right there.

662
00:33:03,825 --> 00:33:04,905
I'm looking for him.

663
00:33:09,145 --> 00:33:09,744
You've been

664
00:33:09,825 --> 00:33:11,105
impersonating Cheng Lisu, right?

665
00:33:11,585 --> 00:33:13,424
The real Cheng Lisu
couldn't fight at all.

666
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,545
I bet it's hard

667
00:33:14,825 --> 00:33:15,905
to impersonate him.

668
00:33:17,865 --> 00:33:18,504
In that case,

669
00:33:19,024 --> 00:33:20,105
stay with us for now.

670
00:33:21,464 --> 00:33:22,585
You saved Miss Song.

671
00:33:23,345 --> 00:33:24,065
You'll handle it.

672
00:33:24,664 --> 00:33:25,424
Me?

673
00:33:26,424 --> 00:33:28,385
She's your nephew's fiancée.

674
00:33:28,785 --> 00:33:29,664
That's not true.

675
00:33:31,704 --> 00:33:32,464
You heard her.

676
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,024
I lost my luggage and money

677
00:33:42,184 --> 00:33:43,024
because of

678
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:43,905
those hooligans.

679
00:33:44,944 --> 00:33:45,504
Could you

680
00:33:45,825 --> 00:33:47,305
front my room payment?

681
00:33:47,865 --> 00:33:48,984
I'll repay double...

682
00:33:49,385 --> 00:33:49,984
No.

683
00:33:50,345 --> 00:33:51,545
Tenfold.

684
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:57,398
(Sun Mansion)

685
00:34:03,184 --> 00:34:05,625
Why did you have to provoke

686
00:34:07,224 --> 00:34:09,145
the living God of Death?

687
00:34:12,345 --> 00:34:12,905
Come on.

688
00:34:13,544 --> 00:34:15,376
He's just a military officer.

689
00:34:15,865 --> 00:34:17,185
Father, why are you so timid?

690
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:19,785
"Just a military officer"?

691
00:34:21,064 --> 00:34:22,424
When he followed

692
00:34:22,624 --> 00:34:23,624
Xiao Zhongwu west,

693
00:34:23,785 --> 00:34:25,185
he dared to behead the eldest son

694
00:34:25,345 --> 00:34:26,504
of the censor.

695
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:28,385
Minister Xu

696
00:34:28,464 --> 00:34:29,345
brought this case

697
00:34:29,345 --> 00:34:30,305
to His Majesty.

698
00:34:30,544 --> 00:34:31,544
And what happened?

699
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,584
Minister Xu had to swallow his losses.

700
00:34:34,385 --> 00:34:35,584
If he actually kills you,

701
00:34:35,705 --> 00:34:36,984
what do you think

702
00:34:37,424 --> 00:34:38,345
I could do?

703
00:34:40,424 --> 00:34:42,665
Absolutely nothing.

704
00:34:45,185 --> 00:34:46,064
He...

705
00:34:46,225 --> 00:34:47,265
He's that powerful?

706
00:34:48,665 --> 00:34:49,185
Then,

707
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:50,544
what should we do?

708
00:34:50,825 --> 00:34:52,584
Take it easy.

709
00:34:54,584 --> 00:34:56,345
I've had a trap ready for a long time,

710
00:34:58,225 --> 00:35:00,865
waiting to spring it.

711
00:35:05,064 --> 00:35:06,024
Don't worry, son.

712
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,104
I'll make sure

713
00:35:08,345 --> 00:35:10,385
you're avenged.

714
00:35:12,745 --> 00:35:13,328
Father,

715
00:35:13,464 --> 00:35:14,584
I know you're the best.

716
00:35:14,984 --> 00:35:15,984
But for now,

717
00:35:16,544 --> 00:35:18,865
keep your head down.

718
00:35:21,944 --> 00:35:23,024
Get rid of

719
00:35:23,185 --> 00:35:24,705
the stuff

720
00:35:25,024 --> 00:35:25,905
you buried.

721
00:35:31,385 --> 00:35:32,024
This box.

722
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:33,200
I'll take some too.

723
00:35:34,144 --> 00:35:35,064
Cheng Lisu and I

724
00:35:35,064 --> 00:35:36,064
never got along.

725
00:35:36,504 --> 00:35:37,936
But my father,

726
00:35:38,128 --> 00:35:39,544
who's Cheng Lusu's master,

727
00:35:39,944 --> 00:35:41,360
suddenly got a wild idea

728
00:35:41,504 --> 00:35:42,544
of getting us married.

729
00:35:42,984 --> 00:35:44,424
His family actually approved.

730
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,785
I was planning to run away.

731
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:47,785
But he actually

732
00:35:47,944 --> 00:35:48,905
beat me to it.

733
00:35:49,345 --> 00:35:50,144
It's a total

734
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,944
humiliation.

735
00:35:51,385 --> 00:35:52,024
So, I came here

736
00:35:52,225 --> 00:35:52,944
to get him home

737
00:35:53,144 --> 00:35:54,584
and cancel the engagement.

738
00:35:55,024 --> 00:35:56,305
You don't like Mr. Cheng?

739
00:35:57,144 --> 00:35:58,464
I think he's quite admirable.

740
00:35:58,825 --> 00:35:59,745
Good-looking,

741
00:35:59,905 --> 00:36:00,865
well-born,

742
00:36:00,944 --> 00:36:01,984
and a brilliant doctor.

743
00:36:01,984 --> 00:36:02,984
I bet he has

744
00:36:03,024 --> 00:36:04,064
many admirers

745
00:36:04,225 --> 00:36:04,984
in Yaojing.

746
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:06,225
In medicine,

747
00:36:06,345 --> 00:36:07,024
the heart guides,

748
00:36:07,345 --> 00:36:08,176
the hands follow.

749
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:09,385
But look at him.

750
00:36:09,785 --> 00:36:11,305
Instead of helping people,

751
00:36:11,665 --> 00:36:12,504
he's buttering up

752
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:14,104
the imperial consorts and princesses.

753
00:36:14,265 --> 00:36:15,185
So spineless.

754
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:16,464
I despise him.

755
00:36:18,185 --> 00:36:19,104
You're much better.

756
00:36:22,745 --> 00:36:23,424
Well...

757
00:36:24,185 --> 00:36:25,424
It's not a fair comparison.

758
00:36:28,305 --> 00:36:29,136
Candies.

759
00:36:30,504 --> 00:36:31,584
Is this osmanthus-flavored?

760
00:36:31,584 --> 00:36:32,024
Yeah.

761
00:36:32,104 --> 00:36:33,144
That's right.

762
00:36:35,745 --> 00:36:36,784
Even blind,

763
00:36:36,984 --> 00:36:38,192
aim to be

764
00:36:38,745 --> 00:36:39,705
the most special of all.

765
00:36:41,064 --> 00:36:42,104
This osmanthus candy

766
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:44,912
is the last piece left in the world.

767
00:36:45,825 --> 00:36:46,944
Though inedible now,

768
00:36:47,865 --> 00:36:48,705
it remains sweet.

769
00:36:48,905 --> 00:36:49,776
I won't know

770
00:36:49,944 --> 00:36:51,024
until I taste it.

771
00:36:53,104 --> 00:36:53,840
Though

772
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,305
bitter at first taste,

773
00:36:55,785 --> 00:36:56,584
its core holds

774
00:36:56,825 --> 00:36:57,936
enduring sweetness.

775
00:36:59,865 --> 00:37:00,785
Have it.

776
00:37:05,024 --> 00:37:05,865
I once had

777
00:37:05,905 --> 00:37:06,745
an osmanthus candy.

778
00:37:07,544 --> 00:37:08,305
Not so sweet.

779
00:37:08,944 --> 00:37:09,865
Even a bit bitter.

780
00:37:10,745 --> 00:37:11,665
But it was the best

781
00:37:11,705 --> 00:37:12,984
osmanthus candy in the world.

782
00:37:16,265 --> 00:37:16,984
Someone also

783
00:37:17,024 --> 00:37:18,024
loves osmanthus candies.

784
00:37:18,624 --> 00:37:19,624
One packet please.

785
00:37:19,984 --> 00:37:20,624
Alright.

786
00:37:22,385 --> 00:37:23,185
Is it

787
00:37:23,544 --> 00:37:24,464
for me?

788
00:37:26,185 --> 00:37:26,984
Want some?

789
00:37:27,504 --> 00:37:28,504
Buy your own.

790
00:37:28,745 --> 00:37:29,584
This is a gift.

791
00:37:30,385 --> 00:37:30,944
There you go.

792
00:37:31,144 --> 00:37:31,696
It's ready.

793
00:37:31,865 --> 00:37:32,584
Keep the change.

794
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:33,424
Thank you.

795
00:37:33,984 --> 00:37:34,544
Let's go.

796
00:37:37,665 --> 00:37:38,864
Another girl's gone missing.

797
00:37:38,864 --> 00:37:39,825
It keeps happening

798
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:40,544
over these years.

799
00:37:40,944 --> 00:37:42,265
They're nowhere to be found.

800
00:37:42,584 --> 00:37:43,265
It's tragic.

801
00:37:43,825 --> 00:37:44,665
They say that

802
00:37:44,984 --> 00:37:45,665
Young Master Sun

803
00:37:45,745 --> 00:37:47,584
abducts pretty girls every now and then.

804
00:37:47,984 --> 00:37:48,825
Nobody reported it?

805
00:37:49,024 --> 00:37:49,504
His father

806
00:37:49,665 --> 00:37:50,504
is the Magistrate.

807
00:37:50,825 --> 00:37:51,424
Actually,

808
00:37:51,624 --> 00:37:52,905
once an eyewitness

809
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:54,624
and the victim's family reported it.

810
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:56,185
But both of them

811
00:37:56,345 --> 00:37:57,745
were beaten half to death

812
00:37:57,944 --> 00:37:58,785
and thrown out.

813
00:37:59,225 --> 00:37:59,984
After that,

814
00:38:00,064 --> 00:38:01,265
nobody dared step forward.

815
00:38:03,504 --> 00:38:04,424
The other girls

816
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:05,665
weren't as lucky as you.

817
00:38:09,345 --> 00:38:09,865
Don't worry.

818
00:38:10,825 --> 00:38:11,504
I'll protect you.

819
00:38:13,865 --> 00:38:14,464
I know

820
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,185
you'll always look out for me.

821
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:18,185
Let's go.

822
00:38:21,064 --> 00:38:22,144
Can't anyone do something

823
00:38:22,144 --> 00:38:23,152
about Young Master Sun?

824
00:38:26,944 --> 00:38:27,504
Commander.

825
00:38:28,665 --> 00:38:30,345
I was thinking about you while shopping

826
00:38:30,424 --> 00:38:31,424
with Miss Song.

827
00:38:31,785 --> 00:38:33,305
I bought you osmanthus candies.

828
00:38:35,984 --> 00:38:36,560
Try some.

829
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:37,680
Take them away.

830
00:38:38,865 --> 00:38:39,385
Why?

831
00:38:39,544 --> 00:38:40,816
They're really sweet.

832
00:38:41,104 --> 00:38:41,944
I don't eat sweets.

833
00:38:42,345 --> 00:38:43,385
But you clearly...

834
00:38:47,144 --> 00:38:47,785
I clearly what?

835
00:38:49,225 --> 00:38:50,825
Putting loaches in my shoes.

836
00:38:55,064 --> 00:38:56,265
These candies got dirty.

837
00:38:57,745 --> 00:38:58,576
Don't eat those.

838
00:38:58,785 --> 00:39:00,345
Should I buy you new ones?

839
00:39:00,345 --> 00:39:01,345
No need. Go to class.

840
00:39:09,104 --> 00:39:09,984
You're just

841
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,705
looking down on my cheap gifts.

842
00:39:13,665 --> 00:39:14,225
Fine,

843
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,464
keep them for Mr. Feinu.

844
00:39:15,624 --> 00:39:16,688
He won't eat them, either.

845
00:39:17,168 --> 00:39:18,000
You...

846
00:39:20,185 --> 00:39:20,705
Commander.

847
00:39:23,104 --> 00:39:24,464
The inspector made his appearance.

848
00:39:25,104 --> 00:39:26,144
So, Sun Xiangfu

849
00:39:26,984 --> 00:39:28,544
will invite us to his mansion today.

850
00:39:29,865 --> 00:39:30,865
Get ready.

851
00:39:31,504 --> 00:39:32,504
We're going today?

852
00:39:33,144 --> 00:39:34,024
He's invited us.

853
00:39:35,104 --> 00:39:36,705
The inspector

854
00:39:37,745 --> 00:39:38,984
will likely be there too.

855
00:39:44,225 --> 00:39:44,745
Commander.

856
00:39:45,144 --> 00:39:46,185
Are you worried about me?

857
00:39:48,104 --> 00:39:49,024
Stop talking

858
00:39:49,185 --> 00:39:49,785
and think about

859
00:39:49,984 --> 00:39:51,624
how to maintain your cover.

860
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:53,225
Cheng Lisu is

861
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,448
a renowned noble in Yaojing.

862
00:39:54,584 --> 00:39:55,225
And you...

863
00:39:55,584 --> 00:39:56,665
In Yaojing,

864
00:39:57,225 --> 00:39:58,104
someone like me

865
00:39:58,665 --> 00:39:59,584
could at least

866
00:39:59,905 --> 00:40:01,464
rival Mr. Cheng, if not stand equal

867
00:40:01,504 --> 00:40:02,385
to you.

868
00:40:02,785 --> 00:40:03,464
Otherwise,

869
00:40:03,665 --> 00:40:04,825
why did Miss Song

870
00:40:05,305 --> 00:40:07,064
only remind me to be careful,

871
00:40:07,185 --> 00:40:08,185
and not you?

872
00:40:13,296 --> 00:40:14,051
(Sun Mansion)

873
00:40:14,064 --> 00:40:15,785
What an honor to have you here.

874
00:40:15,785 --> 00:40:17,345
My warmest welcome.

875
00:40:17,345 --> 00:40:18,865
My warmest welcome.

876
00:40:23,144 --> 00:40:24,504
This is the inspector,

877
00:40:24,504 --> 00:40:26,225
Mr. Chu Zhao.

878
00:40:28,865 --> 00:40:29,504
Commander Xiao.

879
00:40:29,705 --> 00:40:30,464
Long time no see.

880
00:40:30,785 --> 00:40:31,504
Mr. Chu.

881
00:40:32,104 --> 00:40:32,865
Long time no see.

882
00:40:40,544 --> 00:40:41,385
(It's him?)

883
00:40:42,104 --> 00:40:43,865
