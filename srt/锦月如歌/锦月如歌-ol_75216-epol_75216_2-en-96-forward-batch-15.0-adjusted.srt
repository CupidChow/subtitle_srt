=Legend of The Female General=

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,856
(Xianchang Academy)

23
00:01:57,972 --> 00:01:58,653
Today

24
00:01:59,532 --> 00:02:01,653
(Year 14 of Qingyuan, Wei, Xianchang Academy)
marks your first enrollment.

25
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:02,933
I know

26
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:05,133
you come from privileged families

27
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:08,732
and have lived in comfort till now.

28
00:02:09,892 --> 00:02:11,013
But at Xianchang Academy,

29
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,773
you must study diligently

30
00:02:13,972 --> 00:02:14,933
day and night

31
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:17,332
to refine your talents
through perseverance

32
00:02:18,092 --> 00:02:19,293
and serve our nation well.

33
00:02:20,884 --> 00:02:23,452
(Master Wei,
Scholar of Xianchang Academy)

34
00:02:23,452 --> 00:02:24,293
Young man,

35
00:02:24,772 --> 00:02:25,732
what's your name?

36
00:02:26,253 --> 00:02:27,652
Why do you keep wearing a mask?

37
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:30,973
Constantly hiding your true appearance

38
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:32,892
is rather rude, don't you think?

39
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:38,413
Master,

40
00:02:38,853 --> 00:02:40,013
I am He Rufei.

41
00:02:40,892 --> 00:02:42,652
My visage is unsightly,

42
00:02:43,093 --> 00:02:44,413
and I fear startling others.

43
00:02:44,853 --> 00:02:46,452
So I cannot remove this mask.

44
00:02:53,932 --> 00:02:55,212
He's the Xiaos' second son?

45
00:02:56,013 --> 00:02:57,253
His exceptionalness lives up

46
00:02:57,413 --> 00:02:58,293
to his reputation!

47
00:02:58,772 --> 00:02:59,452
Indeed.

48
00:03:07,413 --> 00:03:09,133
I, Xiao Jue, apologize for being late.

49
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:10,732
Please forgive me.

50
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:16,864
=Episode 2=

51
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:43,973
(Cheng Lisu,
Imperial Medical Bureau's Top Disciple)

52
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,052
The army doesn't tolerate

53
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:46,212
flashy things,

54
00:03:47,332 --> 00:03:47,892
including you.

55
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,573
I traveled so far to join you.

56
00:03:55,848 --> 00:03:56,768
You treat me like this?

57
00:03:57,172 --> 00:03:59,013
You can go back
for your arranged marriage.

58
00:04:00,973 --> 00:04:01,892
If I could beat you,

59
00:04:02,332 --> 00:04:02,892
I'd have...

60
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:05,533
beaten you senseless.

61
00:04:07,093 --> 00:04:09,373
Feinu, escort Mr. Cheng out.

62
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:11,552
Understood.

63
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:13,172
Would you really

64
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:14,052
abandon your friend

65
00:04:14,052 --> 00:04:14,853
in need?

66
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:16,332
Avoiding marriage

67
00:04:17,293 --> 00:04:18,013
won't kill you.

68
00:04:19,328 --> 00:04:20,448
At worst, they'll maim you.

69
00:04:20,772 --> 00:04:21,373
Xiao Jue.

70
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:22,533
Commander.

71
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:25,332
Uncle.

72
00:04:26,212 --> 00:04:27,293
We're about the same age.

73
00:04:27,652 --> 00:04:29,212
But you're still my maternal uncle.

74
00:04:29,612 --> 00:04:30,612
Please let me stay.

75
00:04:31,652 --> 00:04:32,288
Okay?

76
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:42,092
Thank you.

77
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:00,493
(If you enlist as a woman,)

78
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:02,133
(it will remain a liability.)

79
00:05:02,972 --> 00:05:03,813
(So I have prepared)

80
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:04,772
(for you)

81
00:05:04,813 --> 00:05:05,972
(male identity papers)

82
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:07,332
(of He Yan.)

83
00:05:09,984 --> 00:05:12,133
(He Yan's Household Register)

84
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:13,013
You're He Yan, right?

85
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:15,892
(Two names are different)

86
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:17,053
(in one character.)

87
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:19,373
(Master's foresight is thoughtful.)

88
00:05:20,493 --> 00:05:21,813
To the left tent for screening.

89
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:23,652
Then to the right tent if you pass

90
00:05:23,693 --> 00:05:24,332
to register

91
00:05:24,493 --> 00:05:25,412
for uniforms and money.

92
00:05:26,144 --> 00:05:26,848
Thank you.

93
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:27,573
Next.

94
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:31,173
Commander, what's screening?

95
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:33,092
Don't know what screening is?

96
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:34,133
It's simple.

97
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:35,972
Strip naked for the medic's exam.

98
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:37,212
If you're healthy,

99
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:37,852
you'll pass.

100
00:05:38,613 --> 00:05:39,733
- Thanks.
- Next.

101
00:05:45,652 --> 00:05:46,852
The Gaoxia horse struggles

102
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:48,332
with the climate.

103
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:49,892
It hasn't eaten.

104
00:05:50,693 --> 00:05:51,332
Examine it.

105
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:52,573
See what ails it.

106
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:53,452
What?

107
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:55,693
I, a future imperial physician,

108
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:56,693
am treating a horse?

109
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:57,933
As a healer,

110
00:05:58,532 --> 00:06:00,092
shouldn't you treat all lives equally?

111
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:03,373
Besides, Yezhou Garrison
keeps no idlers.

112
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:04,733
If you want to stay,

113
00:06:05,892 --> 00:06:06,613
be useful.

114
00:06:16,573 --> 00:06:17,693
Fortunately, this is a mare.

115
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,452
Helping it is acceptable.

116
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:20,693
I'd have declined

117
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:21,813
if it were a stallion.

118
00:06:22,972 --> 00:06:24,493
Xiao Jue, watch closely.

119
00:06:24,972 --> 00:06:25,852
I can both heal

120
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:26,933
and tame horses.

121
00:06:40,412 --> 00:06:41,053
Look!

122
00:06:41,532 --> 00:06:42,373
It's spooked!

123
00:06:42,772 --> 00:06:43,373
It's coming!

124
00:06:56,772 --> 00:06:57,408
Make way!

125
00:06:57,772 --> 00:06:58,532
Move aside! Move!

126
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:01,772
Move aside!

127
00:07:46,253 --> 00:07:47,452
That man's way of taming

128
00:07:48,652 --> 00:07:50,013
is unique to the Fuyue Army.

129
00:07:50,772 --> 00:07:51,772
He's He Rufei's man?

130
00:07:55,613 --> 00:07:57,412
(No, I accidentally gave myself away.)

131
00:07:57,933 --> 00:07:58,933
(Xiao Jue noticed it.)

132
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,332
Not bad.

133
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,292
He resembles my heroics in the past.

134
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:06,892
That move he just pulled

135
00:08:07,772 --> 00:08:08,933
is way beyond your skills.

136
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:29,892
(Oh no.)

137
00:08:30,573 --> 00:08:32,053
(Xiao Jue knows Fuyue Army's moves.)

138
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:34,092
(He definitely recognized it.)

139
00:08:34,452 --> 00:08:35,452
(Yet he didn't react.)

140
00:08:36,972 --> 00:08:37,532
(He took me)

141
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:38,532
(as He Rufei's man)

142
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:40,613
(and planned to act against me?)

143
00:08:44,013 --> 00:08:44,532
Come on.

144
00:08:44,772 --> 00:08:45,412
Let's continue.

145
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:47,172
Gather around!

146
00:08:51,892 --> 00:08:52,532
Impressive.

147
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:53,572
You're small.

148
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:54,532
But you're quite good.

149
00:08:54,772 --> 00:08:55,412
You flatter me.

150
00:08:55,772 --> 00:08:56,853
My taming skills could

151
00:08:57,052 --> 00:08:58,412
never match yours, Instructor.

152
00:08:59,936 --> 00:09:00,608
Well...

153
00:09:02,253 --> 00:09:03,013
The army needs

154
00:09:03,013 --> 00:09:03,892
talents like you.

155
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:06,172
But

156
00:09:06,892 --> 00:09:08,093
I haven't been screened yet.

157
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,093
Forget about it.

158
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:10,453
If you can tame such a horse,

159
00:09:10,493 --> 00:09:11,733
your physique must be good.

160
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:12,800
I'll secure the horse.

161
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,368
Then let's handle the documents. Wait.

162
00:09:14,772 --> 00:09:15,613
- Go.
- Thank you.

163
00:09:16,412 --> 00:09:17,253
So naughty.

164
00:09:17,572 --> 00:09:18,613
Turn and slash!

165
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,812
Since you suspect him,

166
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,133
why not kill him directly

167
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:22,812
for good?

168
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,772
If he's truly a spy sent

169
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:25,733
by the ill-intended one,

170
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:27,013
killing one will

171
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,733
only bring replacements.

172
00:09:29,532 --> 00:09:31,052
Rather than endless trouble,

173
00:09:31,412 --> 00:09:32,333
it's better to keep him

174
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:34,613
to potentially lure out the mastermind.

175
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:36,373
I wonder

176
00:09:36,613 --> 00:09:37,973
whether the mastermind is He Rufei

177
00:09:37,973 --> 00:09:38,772
or Xu Jingfu.

178
00:09:39,373 --> 00:09:40,133
You said

179
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:41,812
before your father's campaign,

180
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:43,652
he impeached the prime minister.

181
00:09:44,572 --> 00:09:45,373
Within days,

182
00:09:45,613 --> 00:09:46,532
he fell into an ambush

183
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:47,412
at Mingshui.

184
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:48,932
He Rufei's troops

185
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:50,213
were a hundred li away,

186
00:09:51,052 --> 00:09:51,812
but arrived only

187
00:09:51,853 --> 00:09:53,253
on day seven after your father

188
00:09:53,253 --> 00:09:54,052
sent the letter.

189
00:09:54,772 --> 00:09:55,692
It was intentional.

190
00:09:56,373 --> 00:09:56,892
I think

191
00:09:57,373 --> 00:09:58,613
they are birds of a feather.

192
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:01,532
But we lack concrete evidence.

193
00:10:02,373 --> 00:10:03,253
We can't prove

194
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:04,292
the defeat at Mingshui

195
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:06,253
relates to Xu Jingfu and He Rufei.

196
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:07,733
Nor can we prove

197
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:10,013
their collusion.

198
00:10:11,772 --> 00:10:13,133
Now the Xiao Army is weakened

199
00:10:13,812 --> 00:10:14,932
and disliked by His Majesty.

200
00:10:15,812 --> 00:10:17,172
We can only investigate covertly.

201
00:10:18,172 --> 00:10:19,333
With troop shortages here

202
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,172
and low funds,

203
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:22,772
building a competent new army

204
00:10:23,772 --> 00:10:24,652
is highly challenging.

205
00:10:30,493 --> 00:10:32,052
Investigate that man thoroughly.

206
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:33,613
I want to know

207
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:34,652
whose pawn he is.

208
00:10:35,892 --> 00:10:36,652
Understood.

209
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:41,717
(Xu Mansion)

210
00:10:58,548 --> 00:11:01,600
(Chu Zhao, Disciple of Xu Jingfu)

211
00:11:10,572 --> 00:11:11,424
Master.

212
00:11:13,253 --> 00:11:14,532
Regarding the Que City mission,

213
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:16,532
you've worked hard.

214
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:18,692
As ordered,

215
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,692
I monitored Xiao Jue in Que City.

216
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:22,692
The battle was unwinnable,

217
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:24,292
yet no one anticipated

218
00:11:24,572 --> 00:11:25,652
his ruthless tactic

219
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:26,932
of flooding Que City

220
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,493
to force a reversal.

221
00:11:29,532 --> 00:11:30,172
Pity

222
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:33,532
those countless lost souls.

223
00:11:35,213 --> 00:11:35,772
Zilan,

224
00:11:36,013 --> 00:11:37,292
ensure that Xiao Jue's

225
00:11:37,453 --> 00:11:38,932
flooding of Que City

226
00:11:39,172 --> 00:11:42,052
and mass slaughter of tens of thousands

227
00:11:42,772 --> 00:11:44,133
are publicly exposed

228
00:11:44,373 --> 00:11:47,213
to expose his infamy to the world.

229
00:11:47,493 --> 00:11:48,652
His Majesty's wariness

230
00:11:49,213 --> 00:11:51,373
toward him will grow even deeper.

231
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:55,613
Though victorious,

232
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:58,052
he was promoted in name
but demoted in reality.

233
00:11:58,692 --> 00:12:00,333
He was sent to Yezhou Garrison.

234
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:03,692
Even with his conscription rights
restored,

235
00:12:03,812 --> 00:12:05,453
that desolate wasteland

236
00:12:05,613 --> 00:12:07,652
could never yield decent soldiers.

237
00:12:08,572 --> 00:12:09,213
Moreover,

238
00:12:10,052 --> 00:12:11,172
I discovered in Que City

239
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,213
a fish that slipped through the net.

240
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:16,973
I've positioned him as a hidden pawn

241
00:12:17,172 --> 00:12:17,973
in our strategy.

242
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:19,133
Given time,

243
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,892
he'll become an unstoppable vanguard.

244
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:24,853
Great.

245
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:27,373
Focus on recovering these coming days.

246
00:12:28,052 --> 00:12:28,772
Soon,

247
00:12:29,213 --> 00:12:30,892
you'll be entrusted

248
00:12:30,932 --> 00:12:31,733
with greater tasks.

249
00:12:32,013 --> 00:12:32,772
Understood.

250
00:12:33,613 --> 00:12:34,133
Chu Zhao.

251
00:12:40,412 --> 00:12:43,013
(Xu Pingting, Daughter of Xu Jingfu)
You're back! Did you bring me a gift?

252
00:12:45,093 --> 00:12:46,853
Your impudence grows by the day.

253
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:48,384
Father.

254
00:12:49,692 --> 00:12:50,493
I'd never forget.

255
00:12:56,772 --> 00:12:57,692
What fragrance is this?

256
00:12:58,373 --> 00:12:59,213
Try it to find out.

257
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:01,013
Try it with me.

258
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,093
Go ahead.

259
00:13:06,973 --> 00:13:09,093
Then I'll graciously accept.

260
00:13:10,016 --> 00:13:10,528
Let's go.

261
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:28,932
What's wrong with this tinderbox?

262
00:13:30,373 --> 00:13:31,133
Let me try.

263
00:13:37,853 --> 00:13:38,493
Stop it.

264
00:13:39,412 --> 00:13:40,532
Light it with the candle.

265
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:45,253
Burn him! Burn him!

266
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,292
(Burn him!)

267
00:13:59,253 --> 00:13:59,812
Let me see.

268
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:03,292
You're injured.

269
00:14:06,853 --> 00:14:07,453
Are you okay?

270
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:08,932
It's nothing.

271
00:14:10,093 --> 00:14:10,932
Just got burned.

272
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:12,572
My grip slipped.

273
00:14:33,652 --> 00:14:34,172
Young Master,

274
00:14:35,013 --> 00:14:35,652
your injury...

275
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,892
(Yingxiang, Chu Zhao's maid)
I know you wounded your left arm

276
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:44,812
intentionally.

277
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:45,692
But...

278
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:47,373
I've failed my duties.

279
00:14:48,373 --> 00:14:49,772
And I was also injured by refugees.

280
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:52,892
I feel ashamed, Master.

281
00:14:54,412 --> 00:14:55,973
You're being too harsh with yourself.

282
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,692
To earn Master's favor,

283
00:15:01,093 --> 00:15:02,532
sacrifices must be made.

284
00:15:40,412 --> 00:15:41,412
(A bandit?)

285
00:15:41,716 --> 00:15:44,416
(Wang Ba, Yezhou Garrison recruit)

286
00:15:45,892 --> 00:15:46,613
Move!

287
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:49,248
(Zheng Xuan, Yezhou Garrison recruit)

288
00:15:52,096 --> 00:15:53,248
(Face-tattooing punishment?)

289
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:54,853
(He was a convict)

290
00:15:55,373 --> 00:15:56,052
(and a rogue.)

291
00:15:56,052 --> 00:15:56,812
Boss, your tea.

292
00:15:58,572 --> 00:15:59,333
Well-mannered.

293
00:16:00,052 --> 00:16:00,652
It's tiring.

294
00:16:05,587 --> 00:16:08,160
(Jiang Jiao, Yezhou Garrison recruit)

295
00:16:08,436 --> 00:16:10,432
(Escort Agency)

296
00:16:11,264 --> 00:16:12,480
(Former escort agency member?)

297
00:16:12,613 --> 00:16:13,572
(He must be skilled.)

298
00:16:14,412 --> 00:16:15,133
Look away!

299
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:16,493
Pretty boy.

300
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:17,892
(Paler than me.)

301
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:19,333
(How dare he judge me?)

302
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:24,013
I used to think

303
00:16:24,213 --> 00:16:25,373
(Mai, Yezhou Garrison recruit)
I was the shortest one here

304
00:16:25,572 --> 00:16:26,493
in the camp.

305
00:16:26,892 --> 00:16:27,493
But now

306
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:29,133
you're almost as short as me.

307
00:16:29,772 --> 00:16:30,304
Alright.

308
00:16:30,652 --> 00:16:31,652
We together eat more

309
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:32,572
to grow taller.

310
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,093
By the way, what's your name?

311
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:36,093
He Yan.

312
00:16:36,812 --> 00:16:39,133
Then I'll call you He.

313
00:16:39,572 --> 00:16:40,256
Agreed.

314
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:41,493
I'm Mai.

315
00:16:42,973 --> 00:16:43,812
I was a farmer.

316
00:16:44,013 --> 00:16:44,572
Sleep here.

317
00:16:45,683 --> 00:16:48,224
(Huang Xiong, Yezhou Garrison recruit)

318
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:51,013
(This one was a hunter.)

319
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:53,733
(A killer wearing prayer beads.)

320
00:16:54,052 --> 00:16:54,853
(Interesting.)

321
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:56,253
Thanks.

322
00:16:59,172 --> 00:16:59,692
He,

323
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,892
you'll sleep here tonight.

324
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:04,333
- Okay.
- Let me help.

325
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:05,493
No need.

326
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:38,132
You claim hostility with Xiao Jue,

327
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:39,132
yet you know

328
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:40,453
the Que City battle

329
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:42,132
left his reputation in ruins.

330
00:17:42,572 --> 00:17:43,372
Aren't you afraid

331
00:17:44,572 --> 00:17:45,733
to be implicated by him

332
00:17:46,092 --> 00:17:46,893
or slandered?

333
00:17:47,772 --> 00:17:48,372
Master,

334
00:17:49,253 --> 00:17:49,973
I don't believe

335
00:17:50,532 --> 00:17:52,292
Xiao Jue would flood Que City

336
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,852
just for an easy victory.

337
00:17:54,132 --> 00:17:54,772
Nor would he

338
00:17:55,213 --> 00:17:56,973
sacrifice all the people of Que City

339
00:17:57,132 --> 00:17:58,132
as stepping stones

340
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:00,292
to pave his path to military glory.

341
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,332
Most importantly,

342
00:18:02,693 --> 00:18:05,653
the Xiao Army urgently needs
new recruits right now.

343
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:09,572
This way I can stand out quicker

344
00:18:10,332 --> 00:18:11,292
and prove myself.

345
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:23,413
(The snoring chorus is impressive.)

346
00:18:24,032 --> 00:18:25,213
(I last heard this long ago.)

347
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:48,893
He,

348
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:50,612
you're up so early.

349
00:18:52,812 --> 00:18:53,372
Nature called.

350
00:18:58,812 --> 00:18:59,453
Mr. Shen.

351
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:01,852
- Mr. Shen.
- Mr. Shen.

352
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:05,184
(Shen Han,
Head Instructor of Yezhou Garrison)

353
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:15,052
What guy...

354
00:19:16,413 --> 00:19:17,092
Mr. Shen.

355
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:24,693
Good morning, Commander.

356
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:25,453
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

357
00:19:25,453 --> 00:19:26,016
Good morning.

358
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:35,772
Up already?

359
00:19:36,893 --> 00:19:38,772
He woke up
from nature's call, Commander.

360
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:48,893
Everyone!

361
00:19:49,532 --> 00:19:50,693
Gather at the training field

362
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:53,213
and have ten weighted laps
around the barracks!

363
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:55,292
Not a single lap less.

364
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:56,653
Wait, ten...

365
00:19:57,253 --> 00:19:57,933
Ten laps?

366
00:19:58,493 --> 00:19:59,413
Why?

367
00:20:07,052 --> 00:20:08,653
It was all because of you!

368
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,733
You had to be an early riser

369
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,413
with no team spirit!

370
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:16,372
- Selfish worm!
- Yes, selfish.

371
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:18,253
Go home if you want to sleep in.

372
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:19,653
We're in the army.

373
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:20,893
You...

374
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:22,572
Boss! Boss!

375
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:24,052
If you don't get out now,

376
00:20:24,132 --> 00:20:25,173
you'll be punished harder.

377
00:20:25,812 --> 00:20:26,893
Don't be mad.

378
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,173
Stay calm.

379
00:20:31,893 --> 00:20:32,532
He,

380
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:33,852
I'm afraid I won't

381
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:35,092
keep up with the training.

382
00:20:35,332 --> 00:20:35,840
Don't worry.

383
00:20:36,173 --> 00:20:36,852
Recruit training

384
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:37,852
is always gradual.

385
00:20:37,973 --> 00:20:39,013
Day One will be simple.

386
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,253
I can't go on.

387
00:20:45,572 --> 00:20:47,132
I can't go on. I really can't.

388
00:20:52,332 --> 00:20:52,933
On your feet!

389
00:20:54,013 --> 00:20:55,052
Five more laps!

390
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,253
Come on, He.

391
00:21:01,772 --> 00:21:02,572
I'll count to three.

392
00:21:02,693 --> 00:21:03,812
Two, three!

393
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:05,532
Watch it.

394
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:06,572
One, two, three.

395
00:21:07,052 --> 00:21:07,612
Let's go.

396
00:21:13,173 --> 00:21:13,852
(I didn't know)

397
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:15,332
(how Xiao Jue trained his men.)

398
00:21:16,213 --> 00:21:17,772
(I have finally seen it now.)

399
00:21:19,092 --> 00:21:20,852
(It starts so intense right away.)

400
00:21:24,132 --> 00:21:24,733
(Xiao Jue)

401
00:21:25,253 --> 00:21:26,572
(has such a pretty face,)

402
00:21:27,173 --> 00:21:28,253
(but he's truly vicious,)

403
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:29,612
(just like before.)

404
00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:32,532
(I thought I could earn merits)

405
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:33,733
(and rise quickly.)

406
00:21:34,532 --> 00:21:35,213
(But Xiao Jue)

407
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:36,173
(is hard on others)

408
00:21:36,572 --> 00:21:37,572
(and harder on himself.)

409
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:43,013
(It seems serving under him won't)

410
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:44,292
(let me rise)

411
00:21:44,893 --> 00:21:45,852
(as easily as I hoped.)

412
00:21:49,572 --> 00:21:51,292
(Severely injured and then poisoned,)

413
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:52,893
(in bed for a month.)

414
00:21:53,173 --> 00:21:54,772
(It nearly drained all my strength.)

415
00:21:55,532 --> 00:21:56,733
(I can't go on like this.)

416
00:22:02,013 --> 00:22:03,733
Commander, it's only the first day.

417
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,052
Aren't you pushing them too hard?

418
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:07,372
Mr. Shen,

419
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:08,893
these recruits

420
00:22:09,092 --> 00:22:10,292
are either country folk

421
00:22:10,453 --> 00:22:11,532
or bandits and thugs.

422
00:22:11,893 --> 00:22:13,253
Like with that horse,

423
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:15,493
the Commander's harsh methods

424
00:22:15,772 --> 00:22:16,413
aren't about

425
00:22:16,413 --> 00:22:17,413
breaking their spirit.

426
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:19,612
He's testing their potential.

427
00:22:20,612 --> 00:22:21,453
Mr. Cheng, you know

428
00:22:21,453 --> 00:22:22,213
our Commander well.

429
00:22:25,132 --> 00:22:26,493
Isn't he the horse-taming prodigy

430
00:22:26,493 --> 00:22:27,413
from yesterday?

431
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:28,772
Why is everyone else

432
00:22:28,772 --> 00:22:29,893
on their seventh lap

433
00:22:30,253 --> 00:22:31,493
while he started his fourth?

434
00:22:32,092 --> 00:22:33,132
In my opinion,

435
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:34,612
he's lacking in potential.

436
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:35,173
Don't speak

437
00:22:35,173 --> 00:22:36,053
of my savior that way.

438
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:37,013
So what if he is?

439
00:22:37,532 --> 00:22:38,332
He could still

440
00:22:38,653 --> 00:22:39,852
make a good army cook.

441
00:22:41,013 --> 00:22:41,812
Army cook?

442
00:22:42,973 --> 00:22:43,893
You underestimate him.

443
00:22:46,013 --> 00:22:46,733
I actually think

444
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:48,413
he's perfect

445
00:22:48,413 --> 00:22:49,733
scout material.

446
00:23:00,052 --> 00:23:02,733
Now we'll learn to use various weapons.

447
00:23:09,132 --> 00:23:09,893
I can barely stand.

448
00:23:22,332 --> 00:23:22,973
He,

449
00:23:23,493 --> 00:23:24,893
why is your sword so short?

450
00:23:25,413 --> 00:23:26,653
It's not even arm's length.

451
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,493
It's twin blades.

452
00:23:28,973 --> 00:23:29,612
Not a sword,

453
00:23:30,092 --> 00:23:30,852
but a pair.

454
00:23:31,173 --> 00:23:33,052
W-What twin blades?

455
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:35,173
Real men use this.

456
00:23:36,453 --> 00:23:37,292
So flashy.

457
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:37,893
Exactly.

458
00:23:38,213 --> 00:23:39,572
Sounds like useless decoration.

459
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,653
- Good.
- Not bad.

460
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:10,532
He's got skills.

461
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,653
That should be one technique.

462
00:24:18,493 --> 00:24:19,173
That's sad.

463
00:24:19,772 --> 00:24:20,733
He can't fight properly.

464
00:24:25,453 --> 00:24:26,812
I'm exhausted. Need a break.

465
00:24:40,493 --> 00:24:41,173
He's decent.

466
00:24:43,173 --> 00:24:44,253
- Good!
- Good!

467
00:24:44,812 --> 00:24:45,453
(Lei Hou, Yezhou Garrison recruit)
Impressive!

468
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:52,332
- Good!
- Good!

469
00:24:55,253 --> 00:24:56,092
That's real skill.

470
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,013
A-Are you staring or fighting?

471
00:25:04,893 --> 00:25:06,052
Move back. My turn first.

472
00:25:24,532 --> 00:25:25,173
Impressive!

473
00:25:25,253 --> 00:25:26,292
- Amazing!
- Amazing!

474
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:30,253
Your turn.

475
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:32,372
Hurry up.

476
00:25:38,812 --> 00:25:40,493
We're on the clock here.

477
00:25:51,052 --> 00:25:51,852
Draw it back.

478
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:52,852
Come on.

479
00:25:55,772 --> 00:25:56,292
No need.

480
00:25:56,852 --> 00:25:57,372
I can't pull

481
00:25:57,852 --> 00:25:58,453
this bow.

482
00:26:02,772 --> 00:26:04,292
His stance looked decent.

483
00:26:07,493 --> 00:26:09,132
This bow requires real strength.

484
00:26:10,532 --> 00:26:11,532
We can't blame He Yan.

485
00:26:17,253 --> 00:26:17,812
He,

486
00:26:18,413 --> 00:26:19,413
he excels at everything.

487
00:26:19,772 --> 00:26:20,812
We need to work harder.

488
00:26:32,453 --> 00:26:33,024
Block!

489
00:26:37,933 --> 00:26:38,464
Retract!

490
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:41,933
Again.

491
00:26:42,493 --> 00:26:43,072
Strike!

492
00:26:45,332 --> 00:26:45,856
Thrust!

493
00:26:49,132 --> 00:26:49,696
Block!

494
00:26:52,572 --> 00:26:53,216
Retract!

495
00:26:54,653 --> 00:26:55,292
Again.

496
00:26:56,132 --> 00:26:56,768
Strike!

497
00:26:58,453 --> 00:26:59,072
Thrust!

498
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:01,184
Block!

499
00:27:25,292 --> 00:27:26,013
What's funny?

500
00:27:27,453 --> 00:27:28,893
Pick it up. Keep going.

501
00:27:33,413 --> 00:27:34,612
A pretty face with nothing.

502
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:35,812
All show, no skill.

503
00:27:36,453 --> 00:27:37,088
Retract!

504
00:27:41,253 --> 00:27:42,092
Regardless,

505
00:27:42,332 --> 00:27:43,453
he picked up the spear.

506
00:27:43,733 --> 00:27:44,852
That's commendable.

507
00:27:48,332 --> 00:27:49,772
What did you find about He Yan?

508
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:51,532
He's from a gatekeeper's family

509
00:27:51,572 --> 00:27:52,132
in Jiazhou.

510
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:53,852
No prior military history.

511
00:27:54,653 --> 00:27:56,213
No suspicious family connections.

512
00:27:56,933 --> 00:27:57,532
Currently,

513
00:27:58,052 --> 00:27:59,092
his background checks out.

514
00:28:01,812 --> 00:28:03,253
Yet he's skilled in horsemanship

515
00:28:03,852 --> 00:28:05,733
and knows military routines well.

516
00:28:06,693 --> 00:28:07,733
He's clearly a seasoned

517
00:28:07,733 --> 00:28:08,413
soldier.

518
00:28:09,092 --> 00:28:09,852
But during drills,

519
00:28:10,653 --> 00:28:11,812
he performs pathetically.

520
00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:14,292
I'm quite curious.

521
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:16,572
Is he faking it

522
00:28:17,453 --> 00:28:18,772
or truly useless?

523
00:28:22,772 --> 00:28:23,453
The others?

524
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,640
Commander,

525
00:28:25,253 --> 00:28:26,653
recruits have diverse backgrounds.

526
00:28:27,092 --> 00:28:27,812
Some have

527
00:28:27,812 --> 00:28:28,372
dubious pasts.

528
00:28:28,852 --> 00:28:30,016
But the only one who faked it

529
00:28:30,772 --> 00:28:31,413
is this person.

530
00:28:41,532 --> 00:28:42,852
Send two teams from Mingshui.

531
00:28:43,413 --> 00:28:44,292
One to Jiazhou

532
00:28:44,812 --> 00:28:46,213
and one to Que City.

533
00:28:47,493 --> 00:28:49,092
Investigate this impostor thoroughly.

534
00:28:50,213 --> 00:28:50,772
The rest

535
00:28:52,173 --> 00:28:53,612
continue investigating in Mingshui.

536
00:28:54,572 --> 00:28:55,328
As you command.

537
00:29:00,307 --> 00:29:03,680
(Longevity of Cranes and Pines)

538
00:29:10,611 --> 00:29:13,248
(Song Wan, Xiao Jue's Mother)

539
00:30:17,213 --> 00:30:18,013
What's that smell?

540
00:30:21,092 --> 00:30:21,933
It seems to be

541
00:30:22,092 --> 00:30:23,173
from the mountain pass.

542
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:27,852
The smell of sulfur?

543
00:30:29,893 --> 00:30:30,733
A hot spring?

544
00:31:01,532 --> 00:31:02,332
(But, Sister,)

545
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:04,092
(the achievements you have today)

546
00:31:04,772 --> 00:31:05,572
are entirely due to

547
00:31:05,852 --> 00:31:08,332
your identity
as the He family's legitimate heir.

548
00:31:08,893 --> 00:31:10,372
(Even with the name He Rufei,)

549
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:12,372
as a woman,

550
00:31:13,213 --> 00:31:13,973
how could you

551
00:31:14,413 --> 00:31:16,332
(achieve such accomplishments
and reputation?)

552
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:20,213
(Those were all earned)

553
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:21,893
(through my pain, blood, and tears.)

554
00:31:23,772 --> 00:31:25,132
(The He family's heir)

555
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:28,413
(are just empty words.)

556
00:31:30,332 --> 00:31:30,973
(What's mine)

557
00:31:32,213 --> 00:31:33,213
(can't be taken away.)

558
00:31:48,772 --> 00:31:49,852
Only months have passed.

559
00:31:50,933 --> 00:31:52,453
But it feels like a lifetime ago.

560
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:56,493
In my past life, I hid in shadows.

561
00:31:57,733 --> 00:31:59,693
Only the moon saw my true face.

562
00:32:02,132 --> 00:32:03,052
In this life,

563
00:32:04,693 --> 00:32:05,933
I can finally

564
00:32:07,013 --> 00:32:09,092
fight with honor.

565
00:32:15,253 --> 00:32:16,332
(With this hot spring)

566
00:32:17,013 --> 00:32:18,013
(and proper training,)

567
00:32:19,013 --> 00:32:20,213
(I should recover completely)

568
00:32:20,413 --> 00:32:21,213
(in a few days.)
