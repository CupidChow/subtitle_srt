=Legend of The Female General=

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,856
(Xianchang Academy)

23
00:02:12,972 --> 00:02:13,653
Today

24
00:02:14,532 --> 00:02:16,653
(Year 14 of Qingyuan, Wei, Xianchang Academy)
marks your first enrollment.

25
00:02:17,172 --> 00:02:17,933
I know

26
00:02:18,732 --> 00:02:20,133
you come from privileged families

27
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,732
and have lived in comfort till now.

28
00:02:24,892 --> 00:02:26,013
But at Xianchang Academy,

29
00:02:26,732 --> 00:02:28,773
you must study diligently

30
00:02:28,972 --> 00:02:29,933
day and night

31
00:02:30,372 --> 00:02:32,332
to refine your talents
through perseverance

32
00:02:33,092 --> 00:02:34,293
and serve our nation well.

33
00:02:35,884 --> 00:02:38,452
(Master Wei,
Scholar of Xianchang Academy)

34
00:02:38,452 --> 00:02:39,293
Young man,

35
00:02:39,772 --> 00:02:40,732
what's your name?

36
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:42,652
Why do you keep wearing a mask?

37
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:45,973
Constantly hiding your true appearance

38
00:02:46,492 --> 00:02:47,892
is rather rude, don't you think?

39
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:53,413
Master,

40
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:55,013
I am He Rufei.

41
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:57,652
My visage is unsightly,

42
00:02:58,093 --> 00:02:59,413
and I fear startling others.

43
00:02:59,853 --> 00:03:01,452
So I cannot remove this mask.

44
00:03:08,932 --> 00:03:10,212
He's the Xiaos' second son?

45
00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:12,253
His exceptionalness lives up

46
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:13,293
to his reputation!

47
00:03:13,772 --> 00:03:14,452
Indeed.

48
00:03:22,413 --> 00:03:24,133
I, Xiao Jue, apologize for being late.

49
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:25,732
Please forgive me.

50
00:03:28,844 --> 00:03:31,864
=Episode 2=

51
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:58,973
(Cheng Lisu,
Imperial Medical Bureau's Top Disciple)

52
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:00,052
The army doesn't tolerate

53
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:01,212
flashy things,

54
00:04:02,332 --> 00:04:02,892
including you.

55
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:10,573
I traveled so far to join you.

56
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:11,768
You treat me like this?

57
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:14,013
You can go back
for your arranged marriage.

58
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:16,892
If I could beat you,

59
00:04:17,332 --> 00:04:17,892
I'd have...

60
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:20,533
beaten you senseless.

61
00:04:22,093 --> 00:04:24,373
Feinu, escort Mr. Cheng out.

62
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:26,552
Understood.

63
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,172
Would you really

64
00:04:28,172 --> 00:04:29,052
abandon your friend

65
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:29,853
in need?

66
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:31,332
Avoiding marriage

67
00:04:32,293 --> 00:04:33,013
won't kill you.

68
00:04:34,328 --> 00:04:35,448
At worst, they'll maim you.

69
00:04:35,772 --> 00:04:36,373
Xiao Jue.

70
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:37,533
Commander.

71
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:40,332
Uncle.

72
00:04:41,212 --> 00:04:42,293
We're about the same age.

73
00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:44,212
But you're still my maternal uncle.

74
00:04:44,612 --> 00:04:45,612
Please let me stay.

75
00:04:46,652 --> 00:04:47,288
Okay?

76
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:57,092
Thank you.

77
00:05:13,852 --> 00:05:15,493
(If you enlist as a woman,)

78
00:05:15,972 --> 00:05:17,133
(it will remain a liability.)

79
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:18,813
(So I have prepared)

80
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:19,772
(for you)

81
00:05:19,813 --> 00:05:20,972
(male identity papers)

82
00:05:21,452 --> 00:05:22,332
(of He Yan.)

83
00:05:24,984 --> 00:05:27,133
(He Yan's Household Register)

84
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:28,013
You're He Yan, right?

85
00:05:29,852 --> 00:05:30,892
(Two names are different)

86
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:32,053
(in one character.)

87
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:34,373
(Master's foresight is thoughtful.)

88
00:05:35,493 --> 00:05:36,813
To the left tent for screening.

89
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,652
Then to the right tent if you pass

90
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:39,332
to register

91
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:40,412
for uniforms and money.

92
00:05:41,144 --> 00:05:41,848
Thank you.

93
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:42,573
Next.

94
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:46,173
Commander, what's screening?

95
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:48,092
Don't know what screening is?

96
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:49,133
It's simple.

97
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:50,972
Strip naked for the medic's exam.

98
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:52,212
If you're healthy,

99
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:52,852
you'll pass.

100
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:54,733
- Thanks.
- Next.

101
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:01,852
The Gaoxia horse struggles

102
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:03,332
with the climate.

103
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:04,892
It hasn't eaten.

104
00:06:05,693 --> 00:06:06,332
Examine it.

105
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:07,573
See what ails it.

106
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:08,452
What?

107
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:10,693
I, a future imperial physician,

108
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:11,693
am treating a horse?

109
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:12,933
As a healer,

110
00:06:13,532 --> 00:06:15,092
shouldn't you treat all lives equally?

111
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:18,373
Besides, Yezhou Garrison
keeps no idlers.

112
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:19,733
If you want to stay,

113
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:21,613
be useful.

114
00:06:31,573 --> 00:06:32,693
Fortunately, this is a mare.

115
00:06:33,212 --> 00:06:34,452
Helping it is acceptable.

116
00:06:34,892 --> 00:06:35,693
I'd have declined

117
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:36,813
if it were a stallion.

118
00:06:37,972 --> 00:06:39,493
Xiao Jue, watch closely.

119
00:06:39,972 --> 00:06:40,852
I can both heal

120
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:41,933
and tame horses.

121
00:06:55,412 --> 00:06:56,053
Look!

122
00:06:56,532 --> 00:06:57,373
It's spooked!

123
00:06:57,772 --> 00:06:58,373
It's coming!

124
00:07:11,772 --> 00:07:12,408
Make way!

125
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:13,532
Move aside! Move!

126
00:07:16,173 --> 00:07:16,772
Move aside!

127
00:08:01,253 --> 00:08:02,452
That man's way of taming

128
00:08:03,652 --> 00:08:05,013
is unique to the Fuyue Army.

129
00:08:05,772 --> 00:08:06,772
He's He Rufei's man?

130
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:12,412
(No, I accidentally gave myself away.)

131
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:13,933
(Xiao Jue noticed it.)

132
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:15,332
Not bad.

133
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:17,292
He resembles my heroics in the past.

134
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,892
That move he just pulled

135
00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:23,933
is way beyond your skills.

136
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:44,892
(Oh no.)

137
00:08:45,573 --> 00:08:47,053
(Xiao Jue knows Fuyue Army's moves.)

138
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:49,092
(He definitely recognized it.)

139
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:50,452
(Yet he didn't react.)

140
00:08:51,972 --> 00:08:52,532
(He took me)

141
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,532
(as He Rufei's man)

142
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:55,613
(and planned to act against me?)

143
00:08:59,013 --> 00:08:59,532
Come on.

144
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:00,412
Let's continue.

145
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:02,172
Gather around!

146
00:09:06,892 --> 00:09:07,532
Impressive.

147
00:09:07,932 --> 00:09:08,572
You're small.

148
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:09,532
But you're quite good.

149
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:10,412
You flatter me.

150
00:09:10,772 --> 00:09:11,853
My taming skills could

151
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,412
never match yours, Instructor.

152
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:15,608
Well...

153
00:09:17,253 --> 00:09:18,013
The army needs

154
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:18,892
talents like you.

155
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:21,172
But

156
00:09:21,892 --> 00:09:23,093
I haven't been screened yet.

157
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,093
Forget about it.

158
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:25,453
If you can tame such a horse,

159
00:09:25,493 --> 00:09:26,733
your physique must be good.

160
00:09:26,872 --> 00:09:27,800
I'll secure the horse.

161
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,368
Then let's handle the documents. Wait.

162
00:09:29,772 --> 00:09:30,613
- Go.
- Thank you.

163
00:09:31,412 --> 00:09:32,253
So naughty.

164
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,613
Turn and slash!

165
00:09:34,892 --> 00:09:35,812
Since you suspect him,

166
00:09:36,093 --> 00:09:37,133
why not kill him directly

167
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:37,812
for good?

168
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,772
If he's truly a spy sent

169
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:40,733
by the ill-intended one,

170
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:42,013
killing one will

171
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:43,733
only bring replacements.

172
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:46,052
Rather than endless trouble,

173
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:47,333
it's better to keep him

174
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:49,613
to potentially lure out the mastermind.

175
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:51,373
I wonder

176
00:09:51,613 --> 00:09:52,973
whether the mastermind is He Rufei

177
00:09:52,973 --> 00:09:53,772
or Xu Jingfu.

178
00:09:54,373 --> 00:09:55,133
You said

179
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:56,812
before your father's campaign,

180
00:09:57,172 --> 00:09:58,652
he impeached the prime minister.

181
00:09:59,572 --> 00:10:00,373
Within days,

182
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:01,532
he fell into an ambush

183
00:10:01,652 --> 00:10:02,412
at Mingshui.

184
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:03,932
He Rufei's troops

185
00:10:04,013 --> 00:10:05,213
were a hundred li away,

186
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:06,812
but arrived only

187
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:08,253
on day seven after your father

188
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:09,052
sent the letter.

189
00:10:09,772 --> 00:10:10,692
It was intentional.

190
00:10:11,373 --> 00:10:11,892
I think

191
00:10:12,373 --> 00:10:13,613
they are birds of a feather.

192
00:10:15,052 --> 00:10:16,532
But we lack concrete evidence.

193
00:10:17,373 --> 00:10:18,253
We can't prove

194
00:10:18,253 --> 00:10:19,292
the defeat at Mingshui

195
00:10:19,572 --> 00:10:21,253
relates to Xu Jingfu and He Rufei.

196
00:10:21,932 --> 00:10:22,733
Nor can we prove

197
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,013
their collusion.

198
00:10:26,772 --> 00:10:28,133
Now the Xiao Army is weakened

199
00:10:28,812 --> 00:10:29,932
and disliked by His Majesty.

200
00:10:30,812 --> 00:10:32,172
We can only investigate covertly.

201
00:10:33,172 --> 00:10:34,333
With troop shortages here

202
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,172
and low funds,

203
00:10:36,373 --> 00:10:37,772
building a competent new army

204
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:39,652
is highly challenging.

205
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:47,052
Investigate that man thoroughly.

206
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:48,613
I want to know

207
00:10:48,772 --> 00:10:49,652
whose pawn he is.

208
00:10:50,892 --> 00:10:51,652
Understood.

209
00:10:54,508 --> 00:10:56,717
(Xu Mansion)

210
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,600
(Chu Zhao, Disciple of Xu Jingfu)

211
00:11:25,572 --> 00:11:26,424
Master.

212
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:29,532
Regarding the Que City mission,

213
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:31,532
you've worked hard.

214
00:11:33,013 --> 00:11:33,692
As ordered,

215
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,692
I monitored Xiao Jue in Que City.

216
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:37,692
The battle was unwinnable,

217
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:39,292
yet no one anticipated

218
00:11:39,572 --> 00:11:40,652
his ruthless tactic

219
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:41,932
of flooding Que City

220
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:43,493
to force a reversal.

221
00:11:44,532 --> 00:11:45,172
Pity

222
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,532
those countless lost souls.

223
00:11:50,213 --> 00:11:50,772
Zilan,

224
00:11:51,013 --> 00:11:52,292
ensure that Xiao Jue's

225
00:11:52,453 --> 00:11:53,932
flooding of Que City

226
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:57,052
and mass slaughter of tens of thousands

227
00:11:57,772 --> 00:11:59,133
are publicly exposed

228
00:11:59,373 --> 00:12:02,213
to expose his infamy to the world.

229
00:12:02,493 --> 00:12:03,652
His Majesty's wariness

230
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:06,373
toward him will grow even deeper.

231
00:12:09,493 --> 00:12:10,613
Though victorious,

232
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:13,052
he was promoted in name
but demoted in reality.

233
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,333
He was sent to Yezhou Garrison.

234
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:18,692
Even with his conscription rights
restored,

235
00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:20,453
that desolate wasteland

236
00:12:20,613 --> 00:12:22,652
could never yield decent soldiers.

237
00:12:23,572 --> 00:12:24,213
Moreover,

238
00:12:25,052 --> 00:12:26,172
I discovered in Que City

239
00:12:26,772 --> 00:12:28,213
a fish that slipped through the net.

240
00:12:30,172 --> 00:12:31,973
I've positioned him as a hidden pawn

241
00:12:32,172 --> 00:12:32,973
in our strategy.

242
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:34,133
Given time,

243
00:12:34,572 --> 00:12:36,892
he'll become an unstoppable vanguard.

244
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:39,853
Great.

245
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:42,373
Focus on recovering these coming days.

246
00:12:43,052 --> 00:12:43,772
Soon,

247
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:45,892
you'll be entrusted

248
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:46,733
with greater tasks.

249
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:47,772
Understood.

250
00:12:48,613 --> 00:12:49,133
Chu Zhao.

251
00:12:55,412 --> 00:12:58,013
(Xu Pingting, Daughter of Xu Jingfu)
You're back! Did you bring me a gift?

252
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:01,853
Your impudence grows by the day.

253
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:03,384
Father.

254
00:13:04,692 --> 00:13:05,493
I'd never forget.

255
00:13:11,772 --> 00:13:12,692
What fragrance is this?

256
00:13:13,373 --> 00:13:14,213
Try it to find out.

257
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:16,013
Try it with me.

258
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,093
Go ahead.

259
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:24,093
Then I'll graciously accept.

260
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:25,528
Let's go.

261
00:13:42,172 --> 00:13:43,932
What's wrong with this tinderbox?

262
00:13:45,373 --> 00:13:46,133
Let me try.

263
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:53,493
Stop it.

264
00:13:54,412 --> 00:13:55,532
Light it with the candle.

265
00:13:58,692 --> 00:14:00,253
Burn him! Burn him!

266
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,292
(Burn him!)

267
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:14,812
Let me see.

268
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:18,292
You're injured.

269
00:14:21,853 --> 00:14:22,453
Are you okay?

270
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:23,932
It's nothing.

271
00:14:25,093 --> 00:14:25,932
Just got burned.

272
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:27,572
My grip slipped.

273
00:14:48,652 --> 00:14:49,172
Young Master,

274
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:50,652
your injury...

275
00:14:57,172 --> 00:14:58,892
(Yingxiang, Chu Zhao's maid)
I know you wounded your left arm

276
00:14:58,932 --> 00:14:59,812
intentionally.

277
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:00,692
But...

278
00:15:01,213 --> 00:15:02,373
I've failed my duties.

279
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:04,772
And I was also injured by refugees.

280
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:07,892
I feel ashamed, Master.

281
00:15:09,412 --> 00:15:10,973
You're being too harsh with yourself.

282
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,692
To earn Master's favor,

283
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:17,532
sacrifices must be made.

284
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,412
(A bandit?)

285
00:15:56,716 --> 00:15:59,416
(Wang Ba, Yezhou Garrison recruit)

286
00:16:00,892 --> 00:16:01,613
Move!

287
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:04,248
(Zheng Xuan, Yezhou Garrison recruit)

288
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:08,248
(Face-tattooing punishment?)

289
00:16:08,853 --> 00:16:09,853
(He was a convict)

290
00:16:10,373 --> 00:16:11,052
(and a rogue.)

291
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:11,812
Boss, your tea.

292
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,333
Well-mannered.

293
00:16:15,052 --> 00:16:15,652
It's tiring.

294
00:16:20,587 --> 00:16:23,160
(Jiang Jiao, Yezhou Garrison recruit)

295
00:16:23,436 --> 00:16:25,432
(Escort Agency)

296
00:16:26,264 --> 00:16:27,480
(Former escort agency member?)

297
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:28,572
(He must be skilled.)

298
00:16:29,412 --> 00:16:30,133
Look away!

299
00:16:30,692 --> 00:16:31,493
Pretty boy.

300
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:32,892
(Paler than me.)

301
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,333
(How dare he judge me?)

302
00:16:38,172 --> 00:16:39,013
I used to think

303
00:16:39,213 --> 00:16:40,373
(Mai, Yezhou Garrison recruit)
I was the shortest one here

304
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:41,493
in the camp.

305
00:16:41,892 --> 00:16:42,493
But now

306
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:44,133
you're almost as short as me.

307
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:45,304
Alright.

308
00:16:45,652 --> 00:16:46,652
We together eat more

309
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:47,572
to grow taller.

310
00:16:47,692 --> 00:16:50,093
By the way, what's your name?

311
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:51,093
He Yan.

312
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:54,133
Then I'll call you He.

313
00:16:54,572 --> 00:16:55,256
Agreed.

314
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:56,493
I'm Mai.

315
00:16:57,973 --> 00:16:58,812
I was a farmer.

316
00:16:59,013 --> 00:16:59,572
Sleep here.

317
00:17:00,683 --> 00:17:03,224
(Huang Xiong, Yezhou Garrison recruit)

318
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:06,013
(This one was a hunter.)

319
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,733
(A killer wearing prayer beads.)

320
00:17:09,052 --> 00:17:09,853
(Interesting.)

321
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:11,253
Thanks.

322
00:17:14,172 --> 00:17:14,692
He,

323
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:17,892
you'll sleep here tonight.

324
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:19,333
- Okay.
- Let me help.

325
00:17:19,692 --> 00:17:20,493
No need.

326
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:53,132
You claim hostility with Xiao Jue,

327
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:54,132
yet you know

328
00:17:54,572 --> 00:17:55,453
the Que City battle

329
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:57,132
left his reputation in ruins.

330
00:17:57,572 --> 00:17:58,372
Aren't you afraid

331
00:17:59,572 --> 00:18:00,733
to be implicated by him

332
00:18:01,092 --> 00:18:01,893
or slandered?

333
00:18:02,772 --> 00:18:03,372
Master,

334
00:18:04,253 --> 00:18:04,973
I don't believe

335
00:18:05,532 --> 00:18:07,292
Xiao Jue would flood Que City

336
00:18:07,572 --> 00:18:08,852
just for an easy victory.

337
00:18:09,132 --> 00:18:09,772
Nor would he

338
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:11,973
sacrifice all the people of Que City

339
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,132
as stepping stones

340
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:15,292
to pave his path to military glory.

341
00:18:16,413 --> 00:18:17,332
Most importantly,

342
00:18:17,693 --> 00:18:20,653
the Xiao Army urgently needs
new recruits right now.

343
00:18:21,772 --> 00:18:24,572
This way I can stand out quicker

344
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:26,292
and prove myself.

345
00:18:37,013 --> 00:18:38,413
(The snoring chorus is impressive.)

346
00:18:39,032 --> 00:18:40,213
(I last heard this long ago.)

347
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:03,893
He,

348
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:05,612
you're up so early.

349
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:08,372
Nature called.

350
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:14,453
Mr. Shen.

351
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:16,852
- Mr. Shen.
- Mr. Shen.

352
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:20,184
(Shen Han,
Head Instructor of Yezhou Garrison)

353
00:19:28,173 --> 00:19:30,052
What guy...

354
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:32,092
Mr. Shen.

355
00:19:38,493 --> 00:19:39,693
Good morning, Commander.

356
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:40,453
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

357
00:19:40,453 --> 00:19:41,016
Good morning.

358
00:19:49,973 --> 00:19:50,772
Up already?

359
00:19:51,893 --> 00:19:53,772
He woke up
from nature's call, Commander.

360
00:20:03,213 --> 00:20:03,893
Everyone!

361
00:20:04,532 --> 00:20:05,693
Gather at the training field

362
00:20:06,253 --> 00:20:08,213
and have ten weighted laps
around the barracks!

363
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:10,292
Not a single lap less.

364
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:11,653
Wait, ten...

365
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:12,933
Ten laps?

366
00:20:13,493 --> 00:20:14,413
Why?

367
00:20:22,052 --> 00:20:23,653
It was all because of you!

368
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:26,733
You had to be an early riser

369
00:20:27,253 --> 00:20:29,413
with no team spirit!

370
00:20:29,693 --> 00:20:31,372
- Selfish worm!
- Yes, selfish.

371
00:20:31,893 --> 00:20:33,253
Go home if you want to sleep in.

372
00:20:33,852 --> 00:20:34,653
We're in the army.

373
00:20:35,253 --> 00:20:35,893
You...

374
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:37,572
Boss! Boss!

375
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:39,052
If you don't get out now,

376
00:20:39,132 --> 00:20:40,173
you'll be punished harder.

377
00:20:40,812 --> 00:20:41,893
Don't be mad.

378
00:20:42,092 --> 00:20:43,173
Stay calm.

379
00:20:46,893 --> 00:20:47,532
He,

380
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:48,852
I'm afraid I won't

381
00:20:48,893 --> 00:20:50,092
keep up with the training.

382
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:50,840
Don't worry.

383
00:20:51,173 --> 00:20:51,852
Recruit training

384
00:20:51,933 --> 00:20:52,852
is always gradual.

385
00:20:52,973 --> 00:20:54,013
Day One will be simple.

386
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:00,253
I can't go on.

387
00:21:00,572 --> 00:21:02,132
I can't go on. I really can't.

388
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:07,933
On your feet!

389
00:21:09,013 --> 00:21:10,052
Five more laps!

390
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:16,253
Come on, He.

391
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:17,572
I'll count to three.

392
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,812
Two, three!

393
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:20,532
Watch it.

394
00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:21,572
One, two, three.

395
00:21:22,052 --> 00:21:22,612
Let's go.

396
00:21:28,173 --> 00:21:28,852
(I didn't know)

397
00:21:28,933 --> 00:21:30,332
(how Xiao Jue trained his men.)

398
00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:32,772
(I have finally seen it now.)

399
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,852
(It starts so intense right away.)

400
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:39,733
(Xiao Jue)

401
00:21:40,253 --> 00:21:41,572
(has such a pretty face,)

402
00:21:42,173 --> 00:21:43,253
(but he's truly vicious,)

403
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:44,612
(just like before.)

404
00:21:46,213 --> 00:21:47,532
(I thought I could earn merits)

405
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:48,733
(and rise quickly.)

406
00:21:49,532 --> 00:21:50,213
(But Xiao Jue)

407
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:51,173
(is hard on others)

408
00:21:51,572 --> 00:21:52,572
(and harder on himself.)

409
00:21:56,132 --> 00:21:58,013
(It seems serving under him won't)

410
00:21:58,612 --> 00:21:59,292
(let me rise)

411
00:21:59,893 --> 00:22:00,852
(as easily as I hoped.)

412
00:22:04,572 --> 00:22:06,292
(Severely injured and then poisoned,)

413
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:07,893
(in bed for a month.)

414
00:22:08,173 --> 00:22:09,772
(It nearly drained all my strength.)

415
00:22:10,532 --> 00:22:11,733
(I can't go on like this.)

416
00:22:17,013 --> 00:22:18,733
Commander, it's only the first day.

417
00:22:19,532 --> 00:22:21,052
Aren't you pushing them too hard?

418
00:22:21,693 --> 00:22:22,372
Mr. Shen,

419
00:22:22,973 --> 00:22:23,893
these recruits

420
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,292
are either country folk

421
00:22:25,453 --> 00:22:26,532
or bandits and thugs.

422
00:22:26,893 --> 00:22:28,253
Like with that horse,

423
00:22:28,812 --> 00:22:30,493
the Commander's harsh methods

424
00:22:30,772 --> 00:22:31,413
aren't about

425
00:22:31,413 --> 00:22:32,413
breaking their spirit.

426
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:34,612
He's testing their potential.

427
00:22:35,612 --> 00:22:36,453
Mr. Cheng, you know

428
00:22:36,453 --> 00:22:37,213
our Commander well.

429
00:22:40,132 --> 00:22:41,493
Isn't he the horse-taming prodigy

430
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:42,413
from yesterday?

431
00:22:42,973 --> 00:22:43,772
Why is everyone else

432
00:22:43,772 --> 00:22:44,893
on their seventh lap

433
00:22:45,253 --> 00:22:46,493
while he started his fourth?

434
00:22:47,092 --> 00:22:48,132
In my opinion,

435
00:22:48,453 --> 00:22:49,612
he's lacking in potential.

436
00:22:49,653 --> 00:22:50,173
Don't speak

437
00:22:50,173 --> 00:22:51,053
of my savior that way.

438
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:52,013
So what if he is?

439
00:22:52,532 --> 00:22:53,332
He could still

440
00:22:53,653 --> 00:22:54,852
make a good army cook.

441
00:22:56,013 --> 00:22:56,812
Army cook?

442
00:22:57,973 --> 00:22:58,893
You underestimate him.

443
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:01,733
I actually think

444
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:03,413
he's perfect

445
00:23:03,413 --> 00:23:04,733
scout material.

446
00:23:15,052 --> 00:23:17,733
Now we'll learn to use various weapons.

447
00:23:24,132 --> 00:23:24,893
I can barely stand.

448
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:37,973
He,

449
00:23:38,493 --> 00:23:39,893
why is your sword so short?

450
00:23:40,413 --> 00:23:41,653
It's not even arm's length.

451
00:23:42,572 --> 00:23:43,493
It's twin blades.

452
00:23:43,973 --> 00:23:44,612
Not a sword,

453
00:23:45,092 --> 00:23:45,852
but a pair.

454
00:23:46,173 --> 00:23:48,052
W-What twin blades?

455
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:50,173
Real men use this.

456
00:23:51,453 --> 00:23:52,292
So flashy.

457
00:23:52,332 --> 00:23:52,893
Exactly.

458
00:23:53,213 --> 00:23:54,572
Sounds like useless decoration.

459
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:24,653
- Good.
- Not bad.

460
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:25,532
He's got skills.

461
00:24:31,413 --> 00:24:32,653
That should be one technique.

462
00:24:33,493 --> 00:24:34,173
That's sad.

463
00:24:34,772 --> 00:24:35,733
He can't fight properly.

464
00:24:40,453 --> 00:24:41,812
I'm exhausted. Need a break.

465
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,173
He's decent.

466
00:24:58,173 --> 00:24:59,253
- Good!
- Good!

467
00:24:59,812 --> 00:25:00,453
(Lei Hou, Yezhou Garrison recruit)
Impressive!

468
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:07,332
- Good!
- Good!

469
00:25:10,253 --> 00:25:11,092
That's real skill.

470
00:25:17,292 --> 00:25:19,013
A-Are you staring or fighting?

471
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,052
Move back. My turn first.

472
00:25:39,532 --> 00:25:40,173
Impressive!

473
00:25:40,253 --> 00:25:41,292
- Amazing!
- Amazing!

474
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:45,253
Your turn.

475
00:25:46,572 --> 00:25:47,372
Hurry up.

476
00:25:53,812 --> 00:25:55,493
We're on the clock here.

477
00:26:06,052 --> 00:26:06,852
Draw it back.

478
00:26:07,052 --> 00:26:07,852
Come on.

479
00:26:10,772 --> 00:26:11,292
No need.

480
00:26:11,852 --> 00:26:12,372
I can't pull

481
00:26:12,852 --> 00:26:13,453
this bow.

482
00:26:17,772 --> 00:26:19,292
His stance looked decent.

483
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:24,132
This bow requires real strength.

484
00:26:25,532 --> 00:26:26,532
We can't blame He Yan.

485
00:26:32,253 --> 00:26:32,812
He,

486
00:26:33,413 --> 00:26:34,413
he excels at everything.

487
00:26:34,772 --> 00:26:35,812
We need to work harder.

488
00:26:47,453 --> 00:26:48,024
Block!

489
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:53,464
Retract!

490
00:26:56,413 --> 00:26:56,933
Again.

491
00:26:57,493 --> 00:26:58,072
Strike!

492
00:27:00,332 --> 00:27:00,856
Thrust!

493
00:27:04,132 --> 00:27:04,696
Block!

494
00:27:07,572 --> 00:27:08,216
Retract!

495
00:27:09,653 --> 00:27:10,292
Again.

496
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:11,768
Strike!

497
00:27:13,453 --> 00:27:14,072
Thrust!

498
00:27:15,453 --> 00:27:16,184
Block!

499
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:41,013
What's funny?

500
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:43,893
Pick it up. Keep going.

501
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:49,612
A pretty face with nothing.

502
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:50,812
All show, no skill.

503
00:27:51,453 --> 00:27:52,088
Retract!

504
00:27:56,253 --> 00:27:57,092
Regardless,

505
00:27:57,332 --> 00:27:58,453
he picked up the spear.

506
00:27:58,733 --> 00:27:59,852
That's commendable.

507
00:28:03,332 --> 00:28:04,772
What did you find about He Yan?

508
00:28:05,253 --> 00:28:06,532
He's from a gatekeeper's family

509
00:28:06,572 --> 00:28:07,132
in Jiazhou.

510
00:28:07,733 --> 00:28:08,852
No prior military history.

511
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:11,213
No suspicious family connections.

512
00:28:11,933 --> 00:28:12,532
Currently,

513
00:28:13,052 --> 00:28:14,092
his background checks out.

514
00:28:16,812 --> 00:28:18,253
Yet he's skilled in horsemanship

515
00:28:18,852 --> 00:28:20,733
and knows military routines well.

516
00:28:21,693 --> 00:28:22,733
He's clearly a seasoned

517
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:23,413
soldier.

518
00:28:24,092 --> 00:28:24,852
But during drills,

519
00:28:25,653 --> 00:28:26,812
he performs pathetically.

520
00:28:27,893 --> 00:28:29,292
I'm quite curious.

521
00:28:30,653 --> 00:28:31,572
Is he faking it

522
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:33,772
or truly useless?

523
00:28:37,772 --> 00:28:38,453
The others?

524
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,640
Commander,

525
00:28:40,253 --> 00:28:41,653
recruits have diverse backgrounds.

526
00:28:42,092 --> 00:28:42,812
Some have

527
00:28:42,812 --> 00:28:43,372
dubious pasts.

528
00:28:43,852 --> 00:28:45,016
But the only one who faked it

529
00:28:45,772 --> 00:28:46,413
is this person.

530
00:28:56,532 --> 00:28:57,852
Send two teams from Mingshui.

531
00:28:58,413 --> 00:28:59,292
One to Jiazhou

532
00:28:59,812 --> 00:29:01,213
and one to Que City.

533
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:04,092
Investigate this impostor thoroughly.

534
00:29:05,213 --> 00:29:05,772
The rest

535
00:29:07,173 --> 00:29:08,612
continue investigating in Mingshui.

536
00:29:09,572 --> 00:29:10,328
As you command.

537
00:29:15,307 --> 00:29:18,680
(Longevity of Cranes and Pines)

538
00:29:25,611 --> 00:29:28,248
(Song Wan, Xiao Jue's Mother)

539
00:30:32,213 --> 00:30:33,013
What's that smell?

540
00:30:36,092 --> 00:30:36,933
It seems to be

541
00:30:37,092 --> 00:30:38,173
from the mountain pass.

542
00:30:41,733 --> 00:30:42,852
The smell of sulfur?

543
00:30:44,893 --> 00:30:45,733
A hot spring?

544
00:31:16,532 --> 00:31:17,332
(But, Sister,)

545
00:31:17,733 --> 00:31:19,092
(the achievements you have today)

546
00:31:19,772 --> 00:31:20,572
are entirely due to

547
00:31:20,852 --> 00:31:23,332
your identity
as the He family's legitimate heir.

548
00:31:23,893 --> 00:31:25,372
(Even with the name He Rufei,)

549
00:31:25,572 --> 00:31:27,372
as a woman,

550
00:31:28,213 --> 00:31:28,973
how could you

551
00:31:29,413 --> 00:31:31,332
(achieve such accomplishments
and reputation?)

552
00:31:34,213 --> 00:31:35,213
(Those were all earned)

553
00:31:35,213 --> 00:31:36,893
(through my pain, blood, and tears.)

554
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,132
(The He family's heir)

555
00:31:41,453 --> 00:31:43,413
(are just empty words.)

556
00:31:45,332 --> 00:31:45,973
(What's mine)

557
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:48,213
(can't be taken away.)

558
00:32:03,772 --> 00:32:04,852
Only months have passed.

559
00:32:05,933 --> 00:32:07,453
But it feels like a lifetime ago.

560
00:32:09,733 --> 00:32:11,493
In my past life, I hid in shadows.

561
00:32:12,733 --> 00:32:14,693
Only the moon saw my true face.

562
00:32:17,132 --> 00:32:18,052
In this life,

563
00:32:19,693 --> 00:32:20,933
I can finally

564
00:32:22,013 --> 00:32:24,092
fight with honor.

565
00:32:30,253 --> 00:32:31,332
(With this hot spring)

566
00:32:32,013 --> 00:32:33,013
(and proper training,)

567
00:32:34,013 --> 00:32:35,213
(I should recover completely)

568
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:36,213
(in a few days.)
