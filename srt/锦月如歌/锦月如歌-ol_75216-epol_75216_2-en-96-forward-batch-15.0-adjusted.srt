=Legend of The Female General=

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,856
(Xianchang Academy)

23
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:28,653
Today

24
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:31,653
(Year 14 of Qingyuan, Wei, Xianchang Academy)
marks your first enrollment.

25
00:02:32,172 --> 00:02:32,933
I know

26
00:02:33,732 --> 00:02:35,133
you come from privileged families

27
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:38,732
and have lived in comfort till now.

28
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:41,013
But at Xianchang Academy,

29
00:02:41,732 --> 00:02:43,773
you must study diligently

30
00:02:43,972 --> 00:02:44,933
day and night

31
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:47,332
to refine your talents
through perseverance

32
00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:49,293
and serve our nation well.

33
00:02:50,884 --> 00:02:53,452
(Master Wei,
Scholar of Xianchang Academy)

34
00:02:53,452 --> 00:02:54,293
Young man,

35
00:02:54,772 --> 00:02:55,732
what's your name?

36
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:57,652
Why do you keep wearing a mask?

37
00:02:58,373 --> 00:03:00,973
Constantly hiding your true appearance

38
00:03:01,492 --> 00:03:02,892
is rather rude, don't you think?

39
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:08,413
Master,

40
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:10,013
I am He Rufei.

41
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:12,652
My visage is unsightly,

42
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,413
and I fear startling others.

43
00:03:14,853 --> 00:03:16,452
So I cannot remove this mask.

44
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:25,212
He's the Xiaos' second son?

45
00:03:26,013 --> 00:03:27,253
His exceptionalness lives up

46
00:03:27,413 --> 00:03:28,293
to his reputation!

47
00:03:28,772 --> 00:03:29,452
Indeed.

48
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:39,133
I, Xiao Jue, apologize for being late.

49
00:03:39,772 --> 00:03:40,732
Please forgive me.

50
00:03:43,844 --> 00:03:46,864
=Episode 2=

51
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:13,973
(Cheng Lisu,
Imperial Medical Bureau's Top Disciple)

52
00:04:13,973 --> 00:04:15,052
The army doesn't tolerate

53
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:16,212
flashy things,

54
00:04:17,332 --> 00:04:17,892
including you.

55
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,573
I traveled so far to join you.

56
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:26,768
You treat me like this?

57
00:04:27,172 --> 00:04:29,013
You can go back
for your arranged marriage.

58
00:04:30,973 --> 00:04:31,892
If I could beat you,

59
00:04:32,332 --> 00:04:32,892
I'd have...

60
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:35,533
beaten you senseless.

61
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:39,373
Feinu, escort Mr. Cheng out.

62
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:41,552
Understood.

63
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:43,172
Would you really

64
00:04:43,172 --> 00:04:44,052
abandon your friend

65
00:04:44,052 --> 00:04:44,853
in need?

66
00:04:45,413 --> 00:04:46,332
Avoiding marriage

67
00:04:47,293 --> 00:04:48,013
won't kill you.

68
00:04:49,328 --> 00:04:50,448
At worst, they'll maim you.

69
00:04:50,772 --> 00:04:51,373
Xiao Jue.

70
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:52,533
Commander.

71
00:04:54,413 --> 00:04:55,332
Uncle.

72
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,293
We're about the same age.

73
00:04:57,652 --> 00:04:59,212
But you're still my maternal uncle.

74
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:00,612
Please let me stay.

75
00:05:01,652 --> 00:05:02,288
Okay?

76
00:05:11,532 --> 00:05:12,092
Thank you.

77
00:05:28,852 --> 00:05:30,493
(If you enlist as a woman,)

78
00:05:30,972 --> 00:05:32,133
(it will remain a liability.)

79
00:05:32,972 --> 00:05:33,813
(So I have prepared)

80
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:34,772
(for you)

81
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:35,972
(male identity papers)

82
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:37,332
(of He Yan.)

83
00:05:39,984 --> 00:05:42,133
(He Yan's Household Register)

84
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,013
You're He Yan, right?

85
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:45,892
(Two names are different)

86
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,053
(in one character.)

87
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:49,373
(Master's foresight is thoughtful.)

88
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:51,813
To the left tent for screening.

89
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:53,652
Then to the right tent if you pass

90
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:54,332
to register

91
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:55,412
for uniforms and money.

92
00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:56,848
Thank you.

93
00:05:57,013 --> 00:05:57,573
Next.

94
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:01,173
Commander, what's screening?

95
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:03,092
Don't know what screening is?

96
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:04,133
It's simple.

97
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:05,972
Strip naked for the medic's exam.

98
00:06:06,452 --> 00:06:07,212
If you're healthy,

99
00:06:07,253 --> 00:06:07,852
you'll pass.

100
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:09,733
- Thanks.
- Next.

101
00:06:15,652 --> 00:06:16,852
The Gaoxia horse struggles

102
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:18,332
with the climate.

103
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:19,892
It hasn't eaten.

104
00:06:20,693 --> 00:06:21,332
Examine it.

105
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:22,573
See what ails it.

106
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:23,452
What?

107
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:25,693
I, a future imperial physician,

108
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:26,693
am treating a horse?

109
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:27,933
As a healer,

110
00:06:28,532 --> 00:06:30,092
shouldn't you treat all lives equally?

111
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:33,373
Besides, Yezhou Garrison
keeps no idlers.

112
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:34,733
If you want to stay,

113
00:06:35,892 --> 00:06:36,613
be useful.

114
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,693
Fortunately, this is a mare.

115
00:06:48,212 --> 00:06:49,452
Helping it is acceptable.

116
00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:50,693
I'd have declined

117
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:51,813
if it were a stallion.

118
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:54,493
Xiao Jue, watch closely.

119
00:06:54,972 --> 00:06:55,852
I can both heal

120
00:06:56,092 --> 00:06:56,933
and tame horses.

121
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:11,053
Look!

122
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:12,373
It's spooked!

123
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:13,373
It's coming!

124
00:07:26,772 --> 00:07:27,408
Make way!

125
00:07:27,772 --> 00:07:28,532
Move aside! Move!

126
00:07:31,173 --> 00:07:31,772
Move aside!

127
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:17,452
That man's way of taming

128
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:20,013
is unique to the Fuyue Army.

129
00:08:20,772 --> 00:08:21,772
He's He Rufei's man?

130
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:27,412
(No, I accidentally gave myself away.)

131
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:28,933
(Xiao Jue noticed it.)

132
00:08:29,813 --> 00:08:30,332
Not bad.

133
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:32,292
He resembles my heroics in the past.

134
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:36,892
That move he just pulled

135
00:08:37,772 --> 00:08:38,933
is way beyond your skills.

136
00:08:59,373 --> 00:08:59,892
(Oh no.)

137
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,053
(Xiao Jue knows Fuyue Army's moves.)

138
00:09:02,892 --> 00:09:04,092
(He definitely recognized it.)

139
00:09:04,452 --> 00:09:05,452
(Yet he didn't react.)

140
00:09:06,972 --> 00:09:07,532
(He took me)

141
00:09:07,573 --> 00:09:08,532
(as He Rufei's man)

142
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:10,613
(and planned to act against me?)

143
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:14,532
Come on.

144
00:09:14,772 --> 00:09:15,412
Let's continue.

145
00:09:16,573 --> 00:09:17,172
Gather around!

146
00:09:21,892 --> 00:09:22,532
Impressive.

147
00:09:22,932 --> 00:09:23,572
You're small.

148
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:24,532
But you're quite good.

149
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:25,412
You flatter me.

150
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:26,853
My taming skills could

151
00:09:27,052 --> 00:09:28,412
never match yours, Instructor.

152
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:30,608
Well...

153
00:09:32,253 --> 00:09:33,013
The army needs

154
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:33,892
talents like you.

155
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:36,172
But

156
00:09:36,892 --> 00:09:38,093
I haven't been screened yet.

157
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,093
Forget about it.

158
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:40,453
If you can tame such a horse,

159
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:41,733
your physique must be good.

160
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:42,800
I'll secure the horse.

161
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,368
Then let's handle the documents. Wait.

162
00:09:44,772 --> 00:09:45,613
- Go.
- Thank you.

163
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:47,253
So naughty.

164
00:09:47,572 --> 00:09:48,613
Turn and slash!

165
00:09:49,892 --> 00:09:50,812
Since you suspect him,

166
00:09:51,093 --> 00:09:52,133
why not kill him directly

167
00:09:52,253 --> 00:09:52,812
for good?

168
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,772
If he's truly a spy sent

169
00:09:54,772 --> 00:09:55,733
by the ill-intended one,

170
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:57,013
killing one will

171
00:09:57,692 --> 00:09:58,733
only bring replacements.

172
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,052
Rather than endless trouble,

173
00:10:01,412 --> 00:10:02,333
it's better to keep him

174
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:04,613
to potentially lure out the mastermind.

175
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:06,373
I wonder

176
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:07,973
whether the mastermind is He Rufei

177
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:08,772
or Xu Jingfu.

178
00:10:09,373 --> 00:10:10,133
You said

179
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:11,812
before your father's campaign,

180
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:13,652
he impeached the prime minister.

181
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,373
Within days,

182
00:10:15,613 --> 00:10:16,532
he fell into an ambush

183
00:10:16,652 --> 00:10:17,412
at Mingshui.

184
00:10:17,853 --> 00:10:18,932
He Rufei's troops

185
00:10:19,013 --> 00:10:20,213
were a hundred li away,

186
00:10:21,052 --> 00:10:21,812
but arrived only

187
00:10:21,853 --> 00:10:23,253
on day seven after your father

188
00:10:23,253 --> 00:10:24,052
sent the letter.

189
00:10:24,772 --> 00:10:25,692
It was intentional.

190
00:10:26,373 --> 00:10:26,892
I think

191
00:10:27,373 --> 00:10:28,613
they are birds of a feather.

192
00:10:30,052 --> 00:10:31,532
But we lack concrete evidence.

193
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:33,253
We can't prove

194
00:10:33,253 --> 00:10:34,292
the defeat at Mingshui

195
00:10:34,572 --> 00:10:36,253
relates to Xu Jingfu and He Rufei.

196
00:10:36,932 --> 00:10:37,733
Nor can we prove

197
00:10:38,373 --> 00:10:40,013
their collusion.

198
00:10:41,772 --> 00:10:43,133
Now the Xiao Army is weakened

199
00:10:43,812 --> 00:10:44,932
and disliked by His Majesty.

200
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,172
We can only investigate covertly.

201
00:10:48,172 --> 00:10:49,333
With troop shortages here

202
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,172
and low funds,

203
00:10:51,373 --> 00:10:52,772
building a competent new army

204
00:10:53,772 --> 00:10:54,652
is highly challenging.

205
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,052
Investigate that man thoroughly.

206
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:03,613
I want to know

207
00:11:03,772 --> 00:11:04,652
whose pawn he is.

208
00:11:05,892 --> 00:11:06,652
Understood.

209
00:11:09,508 --> 00:11:11,717
(Xu Mansion)

210
00:11:28,548 --> 00:11:31,600
(Chu Zhao, Disciple of Xu Jingfu)

211
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:41,424
Master.

212
00:11:43,253 --> 00:11:44,532
Regarding the Que City mission,

213
00:11:45,373 --> 00:11:46,532
you've worked hard.

214
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:48,692
As ordered,

215
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,692
I monitored Xiao Jue in Que City.

216
00:11:51,412 --> 00:11:52,692
The battle was unwinnable,

217
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:54,292
yet no one anticipated

218
00:11:54,572 --> 00:11:55,652
his ruthless tactic

219
00:11:55,772 --> 00:11:56,932
of flooding Que City

220
00:11:57,253 --> 00:11:58,493
to force a reversal.

221
00:11:59,532 --> 00:12:00,172
Pity

222
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:03,532
those countless lost souls.

223
00:12:05,213 --> 00:12:05,772
Zilan,

224
00:12:06,013 --> 00:12:07,292
ensure that Xiao Jue's

225
00:12:07,453 --> 00:12:08,932
flooding of Que City

226
00:12:09,172 --> 00:12:12,052
and mass slaughter of tens of thousands

227
00:12:12,772 --> 00:12:14,133
are publicly exposed

228
00:12:14,373 --> 00:12:17,213
to expose his infamy to the world.

229
00:12:17,493 --> 00:12:18,652
His Majesty's wariness

230
00:12:19,213 --> 00:12:21,373
toward him will grow even deeper.

231
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,613
Though victorious,

232
00:12:26,172 --> 00:12:28,052
he was promoted in name
but demoted in reality.

233
00:12:28,692 --> 00:12:30,333
He was sent to Yezhou Garrison.

234
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:33,692
Even with his conscription rights
restored,

235
00:12:33,812 --> 00:12:35,453
that desolate wasteland

236
00:12:35,613 --> 00:12:37,652
could never yield decent soldiers.

237
00:12:38,572 --> 00:12:39,213
Moreover,

238
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:41,172
I discovered in Que City

239
00:12:41,772 --> 00:12:43,213
a fish that slipped through the net.

240
00:12:45,172 --> 00:12:46,973
I've positioned him as a hidden pawn

241
00:12:47,172 --> 00:12:47,973
in our strategy.

242
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:49,133
Given time,

243
00:12:49,572 --> 00:12:51,892
he'll become an unstoppable vanguard.

244
00:12:54,172 --> 00:12:54,853
Great.

245
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:57,373
Focus on recovering these coming days.

246
00:12:58,052 --> 00:12:58,772
Soon,

247
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:00,892
you'll be entrusted

248
00:13:00,932 --> 00:13:01,733
with greater tasks.

249
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:02,772
Understood.

250
00:13:03,613 --> 00:13:04,133
Chu Zhao.

251
00:13:10,412 --> 00:13:13,013
(Xu Pingting, Daughter of Xu Jingfu)
You're back! Did you bring me a gift?

252
00:13:15,093 --> 00:13:16,853
Your impudence grows by the day.

253
00:13:17,692 --> 00:13:18,384
Father.

254
00:13:19,692 --> 00:13:20,493
I'd never forget.

255
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:27,692
What fragrance is this?

256
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:29,213
Try it to find out.

257
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:31,013
Try it with me.

258
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,093
Go ahead.

259
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:39,093
Then I'll graciously accept.

260
00:13:40,016 --> 00:13:40,528
Let's go.

261
00:13:57,172 --> 00:13:58,932
What's wrong with this tinderbox?

262
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:01,133
Let me try.

263
00:14:07,853 --> 00:14:08,493
Stop it.

264
00:14:09,412 --> 00:14:10,532
Light it with the candle.

265
00:14:13,692 --> 00:14:15,253
Burn him! Burn him!

266
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,292
(Burn him!)

267
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:29,812
Let me see.

268
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:33,292
You're injured.

269
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:37,453
Are you okay?

270
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:38,932
It's nothing.

271
00:14:40,093 --> 00:14:40,932
Just got burned.

272
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:42,572
My grip slipped.

273
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,172
Young Master,

274
00:15:05,013 --> 00:15:05,652
your injury...

275
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:13,892
(Yingxiang, Chu Zhao's maid)
I know you wounded your left arm

276
00:15:13,932 --> 00:15:14,812
intentionally.

277
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:15,692
But...

278
00:15:16,213 --> 00:15:17,373
I've failed my duties.

279
00:15:18,373 --> 00:15:19,772
And I was also injured by refugees.

280
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,892
I feel ashamed, Master.

281
00:15:24,412 --> 00:15:25,973
You're being too harsh with yourself.

282
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,692
To earn Master's favor,

283
00:15:31,093 --> 00:15:32,532
sacrifices must be made.

284
00:16:10,412 --> 00:16:11,412
(A bandit?)

285
00:16:11,716 --> 00:16:14,416
(Wang Ba, Yezhou Garrison recruit)

286
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:16,613
Move!

287
00:16:17,347 --> 00:16:19,248
(Zheng Xuan, Yezhou Garrison recruit)

288
00:16:22,096 --> 00:16:23,248
(Face-tattooing punishment?)

289
00:16:23,853 --> 00:16:24,853
(He was a convict)

290
00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:26,052
(and a rogue.)

291
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:26,812
Boss, your tea.

292
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:29,333
Well-mannered.

293
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:30,652
It's tiring.

294
00:16:35,587 --> 00:16:38,160
(Jiang Jiao, Yezhou Garrison recruit)

295
00:16:38,436 --> 00:16:40,432
(Escort Agency)

296
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:42,480
(Former escort agency member?)

297
00:16:42,613 --> 00:16:43,572
(He must be skilled.)

298
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:45,133
Look away!

299
00:16:45,692 --> 00:16:46,493
Pretty boy.

300
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:47,892
(Paler than me.)

301
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:49,333
(How dare he judge me?)

302
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:54,013
I used to think

303
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,373
(Mai, Yezhou Garrison recruit)
I was the shortest one here

304
00:16:55,572 --> 00:16:56,493
in the camp.

305
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:57,493
But now

306
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,133
you're almost as short as me.

307
00:16:59,772 --> 00:17:00,304
Alright.

308
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:01,652
We together eat more

309
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:02,572
to grow taller.

310
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:05,093
By the way, what's your name?

311
00:17:05,493 --> 00:17:06,093
He Yan.

312
00:17:06,812 --> 00:17:09,133
Then I'll call you He.

313
00:17:09,572 --> 00:17:10,256
Agreed.

314
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:11,493
I'm Mai.

315
00:17:12,973 --> 00:17:13,812
I was a farmer.

316
00:17:14,013 --> 00:17:14,572
Sleep here.

317
00:17:15,683 --> 00:17:18,224
(Huang Xiong, Yezhou Garrison recruit)

318
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:21,013
(This one was a hunter.)

319
00:17:21,493 --> 00:17:23,733
(A killer wearing prayer beads.)

320
00:17:24,052 --> 00:17:24,853
(Interesting.)

321
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:26,253
Thanks.

322
00:17:29,172 --> 00:17:29,692
He,

323
00:17:31,453 --> 00:17:32,892
you'll sleep here tonight.

324
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:34,333
- Okay.
- Let me help.

325
00:17:34,692 --> 00:17:35,493
No need.

326
00:18:05,933 --> 00:18:08,132
You claim hostility with Xiao Jue,

327
00:18:08,453 --> 00:18:09,132
yet you know

328
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:10,453
the Que City battle

329
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:12,132
left his reputation in ruins.

330
00:18:12,572 --> 00:18:13,372
Aren't you afraid

331
00:18:14,572 --> 00:18:15,733
to be implicated by him

332
00:18:16,092 --> 00:18:16,893
or slandered?

333
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:18,372
Master,

334
00:18:19,253 --> 00:18:19,973
I don't believe

335
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,292
Xiao Jue would flood Que City

336
00:18:22,572 --> 00:18:23,852
just for an easy victory.

337
00:18:24,132 --> 00:18:24,772
Nor would he

338
00:18:25,213 --> 00:18:26,973
sacrifice all the people of Que City

339
00:18:27,132 --> 00:18:28,132
as stepping stones

340
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,292
to pave his path to military glory.

341
00:18:31,413 --> 00:18:32,332
Most importantly,

342
00:18:32,693 --> 00:18:35,653
the Xiao Army urgently needs
new recruits right now.

343
00:18:36,772 --> 00:18:39,572
This way I can stand out quicker

344
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:41,292
and prove myself.

345
00:18:52,013 --> 00:18:53,413
(The snoring chorus is impressive.)

346
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,213
(I last heard this long ago.)

347
00:19:18,092 --> 00:19:18,893
He,

348
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:20,612
you're up so early.

349
00:19:22,812 --> 00:19:23,372
Nature called.

350
00:19:28,812 --> 00:19:29,453
Mr. Shen.

351
00:19:30,812 --> 00:19:31,852
- Mr. Shen.
- Mr. Shen.

352
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:35,184
(Shen Han,
Head Instructor of Yezhou Garrison)

353
00:19:43,173 --> 00:19:45,052
What guy...

354
00:19:46,413 --> 00:19:47,092
Mr. Shen.

355
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:54,693
Good morning, Commander.

356
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:55,453
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

357
00:19:55,453 --> 00:19:56,016
Good morning.

358
00:20:04,973 --> 00:20:05,772
Up already?

359
00:20:06,893 --> 00:20:08,772
He woke up
from nature's call, Commander.

360
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:18,893
Everyone!

361
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:20,693
Gather at the training field

362
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,213
and have ten weighted laps
around the barracks!

363
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:25,292
Not a single lap less.

364
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:26,653
Wait, ten...

365
00:20:27,253 --> 00:20:27,933
Ten laps?

366
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:29,413
Why?

367
00:20:37,052 --> 00:20:38,653
It was all because of you!

368
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:41,733
You had to be an early riser

369
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:44,413
with no team spirit!

370
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:46,372
- Selfish worm!
- Yes, selfish.

371
00:20:46,893 --> 00:20:48,253
Go home if you want to sleep in.

372
00:20:48,852 --> 00:20:49,653
We're in the army.

373
00:20:50,253 --> 00:20:50,893
You...

374
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:52,572
Boss! Boss!

375
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:54,052
If you don't get out now,

376
00:20:54,132 --> 00:20:55,173
you'll be punished harder.

377
00:20:55,812 --> 00:20:56,893
Don't be mad.

378
00:20:57,092 --> 00:20:58,173
Stay calm.

379
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:02,532
He,

380
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:03,852
I'm afraid I won't

381
00:21:03,893 --> 00:21:05,092
keep up with the training.

382
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:05,840
Don't worry.

383
00:21:06,173 --> 00:21:06,852
Recruit training

384
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:07,852
is always gradual.

385
00:21:07,973 --> 00:21:09,013
Day One will be simple.

386
00:21:14,493 --> 00:21:15,253
I can't go on.

387
00:21:15,572 --> 00:21:17,132
I can't go on. I really can't.

388
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:22,933
On your feet!

389
00:21:24,013 --> 00:21:25,052
Five more laps!

390
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:31,253
Come on, He.

391
00:21:31,772 --> 00:21:32,572
I'll count to three.

392
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:33,812
Two, three!

393
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:35,532
Watch it.

394
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:36,572
One, two, three.

395
00:21:37,052 --> 00:21:37,612
Let's go.

396
00:21:43,173 --> 00:21:43,852
(I didn't know)

397
00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:45,332
(how Xiao Jue trained his men.)

398
00:21:46,213 --> 00:21:47,772
(I have finally seen it now.)

399
00:21:49,092 --> 00:21:50,852
(It starts so intense right away.)

400
00:21:54,132 --> 00:21:54,733
(Xiao Jue)

401
00:21:55,253 --> 00:21:56,572
(has such a pretty face,)

402
00:21:57,173 --> 00:21:58,253
(but he's truly vicious,)

403
00:21:58,733 --> 00:21:59,612
(just like before.)

404
00:22:01,213 --> 00:22:02,532
(I thought I could earn merits)

405
00:22:02,893 --> 00:22:03,733
(and rise quickly.)

406
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,213
(But Xiao Jue)

407
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:06,173
(is hard on others)

408
00:22:06,572 --> 00:22:07,572
(and harder on himself.)

409
00:22:11,132 --> 00:22:13,013
(It seems serving under him won't)

410
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:14,292
(let me rise)

411
00:22:14,893 --> 00:22:15,852
(as easily as I hoped.)

412
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:21,292
(Severely injured and then poisoned,)

413
00:22:21,893 --> 00:22:22,893
(in bed for a month.)

414
00:22:23,173 --> 00:22:24,772
(It nearly drained all my strength.)

415
00:22:25,532 --> 00:22:26,733
(I can't go on like this.)

416
00:22:32,013 --> 00:22:33,733
Commander, it's only the first day.

417
00:22:34,532 --> 00:22:36,052
Aren't you pushing them too hard?

418
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:37,372
Mr. Shen,

419
00:22:37,973 --> 00:22:38,893
these recruits

420
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:40,292
are either country folk

421
00:22:40,453 --> 00:22:41,532
or bandits and thugs.

422
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,253
Like with that horse,

423
00:22:43,812 --> 00:22:45,493
the Commander's harsh methods

424
00:22:45,772 --> 00:22:46,413
aren't about

425
00:22:46,413 --> 00:22:47,413
breaking their spirit.

426
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,612
He's testing their potential.

427
00:22:50,612 --> 00:22:51,453
Mr. Cheng, you know

428
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,213
our Commander well.

429
00:22:55,132 --> 00:22:56,493
Isn't he the horse-taming prodigy

430
00:22:56,493 --> 00:22:57,413
from yesterday?

431
00:22:57,973 --> 00:22:58,772
Why is everyone else

432
00:22:58,772 --> 00:22:59,893
on their seventh lap

433
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,493
while he started his fourth?

434
00:23:02,092 --> 00:23:03,132
In my opinion,

435
00:23:03,453 --> 00:23:04,612
he's lacking in potential.

436
00:23:04,653 --> 00:23:05,173
Don't speak

437
00:23:05,173 --> 00:23:06,053
of my savior that way.

438
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:07,013
So what if he is?

439
00:23:07,532 --> 00:23:08,332
He could still

440
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:09,852
make a good army cook.

441
00:23:11,013 --> 00:23:11,812
Army cook?

442
00:23:12,973 --> 00:23:13,893
You underestimate him.

443
00:23:16,013 --> 00:23:16,733
I actually think

444
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:18,413
he's perfect

445
00:23:18,413 --> 00:23:19,733
scout material.

446
00:23:30,052 --> 00:23:32,733
Now we'll learn to use various weapons.

447
00:23:39,132 --> 00:23:39,893
I can barely stand.

448
00:23:52,332 --> 00:23:52,973
He,

449
00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:54,893
why is your sword so short?

450
00:23:55,413 --> 00:23:56,653
It's not even arm's length.

451
00:23:57,572 --> 00:23:58,493
It's twin blades.

452
00:23:58,973 --> 00:23:59,612
Not a sword,

453
00:24:00,092 --> 00:24:00,852
but a pair.

454
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:03,052
W-What twin blades?

455
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:05,173
Real men use this.

456
00:24:06,453 --> 00:24:07,292
So flashy.

457
00:24:07,332 --> 00:24:07,893
Exactly.

458
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,572
Sounds like useless decoration.

459
00:24:38,213 --> 00:24:39,653
- Good.
- Not bad.

460
00:24:39,733 --> 00:24:40,532
He's got skills.

461
00:24:46,413 --> 00:24:47,653
That should be one technique.

462
00:24:48,493 --> 00:24:49,173
That's sad.

463
00:24:49,772 --> 00:24:50,733
He can't fight properly.

464
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:56,812
I'm exhausted. Need a break.

465
00:25:10,493 --> 00:25:11,173
He's decent.

466
00:25:13,173 --> 00:25:14,253
- Good!
- Good!

467
00:25:14,812 --> 00:25:15,453
(Lei Hou, Yezhou Garrison recruit)
Impressive!

468
00:25:21,173 --> 00:25:22,332
- Good!
- Good!

469
00:25:25,253 --> 00:25:26,092
That's real skill.

470
00:25:32,292 --> 00:25:34,013
A-Are you staring or fighting?

471
00:25:34,893 --> 00:25:36,052
Move back. My turn first.

472
00:25:54,532 --> 00:25:55,173
Impressive!

473
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,292
- Amazing!
- Amazing!

474
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:00,253
Your turn.

475
00:26:01,572 --> 00:26:02,372
Hurry up.

476
00:26:08,812 --> 00:26:10,493
We're on the clock here.

477
00:26:21,052 --> 00:26:21,852
Draw it back.

478
00:26:22,052 --> 00:26:22,852
Come on.

479
00:26:25,772 --> 00:26:26,292
No need.

480
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:27,372
I can't pull

481
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:28,453
this bow.

482
00:26:32,772 --> 00:26:34,292
His stance looked decent.

483
00:26:37,493 --> 00:26:39,132
This bow requires real strength.

484
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:41,532
We can't blame He Yan.

485
00:26:47,253 --> 00:26:47,812
He,

486
00:26:48,413 --> 00:26:49,413
he excels at everything.

487
00:26:49,772 --> 00:26:50,812
We need to work harder.

488
00:27:02,453 --> 00:27:03,024
Block!

489
00:27:07,933 --> 00:27:08,464
Retract!

490
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:11,933
Again.

491
00:27:12,493 --> 00:27:13,072
Strike!

492
00:27:15,332 --> 00:27:15,856
Thrust!

493
00:27:19,132 --> 00:27:19,696
Block!

494
00:27:22,572 --> 00:27:23,216
Retract!

495
00:27:24,653 --> 00:27:25,292
Again.

496
00:27:26,132 --> 00:27:26,768
Strike!

497
00:27:28,453 --> 00:27:29,072
Thrust!

498
00:27:30,453 --> 00:27:31,184
Block!

499
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:56,013
What's funny?

500
00:27:57,453 --> 00:27:58,893
Pick it up. Keep going.

501
00:28:03,413 --> 00:28:04,612
A pretty face with nothing.

502
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:05,812
All show, no skill.

503
00:28:06,453 --> 00:28:07,088
Retract!

504
00:28:11,253 --> 00:28:12,092
Regardless,

505
00:28:12,332 --> 00:28:13,453
he picked up the spear.

506
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:14,852
That's commendable.

507
00:28:18,332 --> 00:28:19,772
What did you find about He Yan?

508
00:28:20,253 --> 00:28:21,532
He's from a gatekeeper's family

509
00:28:21,572 --> 00:28:22,132
in Jiazhou.

510
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:23,852
No prior military history.

511
00:28:24,653 --> 00:28:26,213
No suspicious family connections.

512
00:28:26,933 --> 00:28:27,532
Currently,

513
00:28:28,052 --> 00:28:29,092
his background checks out.

514
00:28:31,812 --> 00:28:33,253
Yet he's skilled in horsemanship

515
00:28:33,852 --> 00:28:35,733
and knows military routines well.

516
00:28:36,693 --> 00:28:37,733
He's clearly a seasoned

517
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:38,413
soldier.

518
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:39,852
But during drills,

519
00:28:40,653 --> 00:28:41,812
he performs pathetically.

520
00:28:42,893 --> 00:28:44,292
I'm quite curious.

521
00:28:45,653 --> 00:28:46,572
Is he faking it

522
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:48,772
or truly useless?

523
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:53,453
The others?

524
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,640
Commander,

525
00:28:55,253 --> 00:28:56,653
recruits have diverse backgrounds.

526
00:28:57,092 --> 00:28:57,812
Some have

527
00:28:57,812 --> 00:28:58,372
dubious pasts.

528
00:28:58,852 --> 00:29:00,016
But the only one who faked it

529
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:01,413
is this person.

530
00:29:11,532 --> 00:29:12,852
Send two teams from Mingshui.

531
00:29:13,413 --> 00:29:14,292
One to Jiazhou

532
00:29:14,812 --> 00:29:16,213
and one to Que City.

533
00:29:17,493 --> 00:29:19,092
Investigate this impostor thoroughly.

534
00:29:20,213 --> 00:29:20,772
The rest

535
00:29:22,173 --> 00:29:23,612
continue investigating in Mingshui.

536
00:29:24,572 --> 00:29:25,328
As you command.

537
00:29:30,307 --> 00:29:33,680
(Longevity of Cranes and Pines)

538
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:43,248
(Song Wan, Xiao Jue's Mother)

539
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:48,013
What's that smell?

540
00:30:51,092 --> 00:30:51,933
It seems to be

541
00:30:52,092 --> 00:30:53,173
from the mountain pass.

542
00:30:56,733 --> 00:30:57,852
The smell of sulfur?

543
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:00,733
A hot spring?

544
00:31:31,532 --> 00:31:32,332
(But, Sister,)

545
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:34,092
(the achievements you have today)

546
00:31:34,772 --> 00:31:35,572
are entirely due to

547
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,332
your identity
as the He family's legitimate heir.

548
00:31:38,893 --> 00:31:40,372
(Even with the name He Rufei,)

549
00:31:40,572 --> 00:31:42,372
as a woman,

550
00:31:43,213 --> 00:31:43,973
how could you

551
00:31:44,413 --> 00:31:46,332
(achieve such accomplishments
and reputation?)

552
00:31:49,213 --> 00:31:50,213
(Those were all earned)

553
00:31:50,213 --> 00:31:51,893
(through my pain, blood, and tears.)

554
00:31:53,772 --> 00:31:55,132
(The He family's heir)

555
00:31:56,453 --> 00:31:58,413
(are just empty words.)

556
00:32:00,332 --> 00:32:00,973
(What's mine)

557
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:03,213
(can't be taken away.)

558
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:19,852
Only months have passed.

559
00:32:20,933 --> 00:32:22,453
But it feels like a lifetime ago.

560
00:32:24,733 --> 00:32:26,493
In my past life, I hid in shadows.

561
00:32:27,733 --> 00:32:29,693
Only the moon saw my true face.

562
00:32:32,132 --> 00:32:33,052
In this life,

563
00:32:34,693 --> 00:32:35,933
I can finally

564
00:32:37,013 --> 00:32:39,092
fight with honor.

565
00:32:45,253 --> 00:32:46,332
(With this hot spring)

566
00:32:47,013 --> 00:32:48,013
(and proper training,)

567
00:32:49,013 --> 00:32:50,213
(I should recover completely)

568
00:32:50,413 --> 00:32:51,213
(in a few days.)
