22

=Episode 34=

23
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:50,860
Under war's shadow,

24
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,979
people always suffer most.

25
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:55,539
If peace reigns,

26
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:58,179
I'd gladly retire.

27
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:02,099
But I intend to be a great general.

28
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,580
How about this?

29
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:04,700
I'll support you.

30
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:07,739
Thank you, General Feihong.

31
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,979
Li Kuang returns to Rundu today.

32
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,420
It should be about time now.

33
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:15,339
I'll see him off.

34
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,980
Don't you want me to go?

35
00:02:17,619 --> 00:02:18,459
Better not.

36
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,540
Li Kuang got startled

37
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:21,700
by Mr. Cheng's

38
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,420
grand display.

39
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,219
If not for me,

40
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:26,020
he'd be long gone.

41
00:02:41,648 --> 00:02:42,928
Send the betrothal certificate?

42
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:43,952
Give it to me.

43
00:02:48,339 --> 00:02:49,659
Cheng Lisu, hey you!

44
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:51,179
You have

45
00:02:51,179 --> 00:02:51,820
peanut allergy!

46
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:53,459
Why eat peanut cakes?

47
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,380
Taotao, I...

48
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,300
You remembered my peanut allergy?

49
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,619
Is this really the time for that?

50
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,380
How much you ate?

51
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:04,219
I'd rather check your pulse.

52
00:03:08,779 --> 00:03:09,980
Your pulse is steady.

53
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,860
You lie to me?

54
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,459
Taotao, I don't.

55
00:03:13,899 --> 00:03:14,980
You care about me too much.

56
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,459
Yes. I care about you and fall for you.

57
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,140
So what?

58
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,100
Give me the thing.

59
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,700
Why stand up?

60
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,260
Song Taotao, I want to marry you.

61
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:32,420
I love you.

62
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,300
I, Cheng Lisu, have

63
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:42,459
fallen for you,

64
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:43,899
wishing to marry you.

65
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,700
To tie the nuptial knot

66
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,899
and travel together,

67
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,860
writing books and tasting herbs.

68
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,700
I'll only marry you.

69
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,540
What do you think?

70
00:03:58,899 --> 00:03:59,459
I don't want

71
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:00,580
to tie the nuptial knot.

72
00:04:04,179 --> 00:04:05,339
I'll be lovebirds with you,

73
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,380
so we can travel around.

74
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:10,779
Right, lovebirds.

75
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:21,459
Albizia flowers?

76
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,779
They calm the mind and the nerve,

77
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:26,820
symbolizing marital bliss.

78
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,260
Taotao,

79
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:50,620
together with you,

80
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,219
I seek no dramatic love.

81
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:54,219
I only want peace and joy

82
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:55,500
with you.

83
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,060
It's the wedding invitation

84
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,020
of the Chengs and Songs.

85
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,659
Lisu and Taotao will

86
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,859
marry this month's end.

87
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:16,060
So fast?

88
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:17,299
Their families

89
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:18,380
have done almost

90
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:19,659
everything of betrothal.

91
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:20,779
Naturally it is fast.

92
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:23,979
Finally,

93
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,740
they could be together.

94
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,020
Yes, they are.

95
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,539
Then when will you

96
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:33,299
and Miss He end up together?

97
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,419
This loquat tree is still here?

98
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,380
So short.

99
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:12,380
Huaijin.

100
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,180
Must you show off

101
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,140
in front of me,

102
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,820
and then mock my height?

103
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:21,140
Back then,

104
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:23,260
you were so cold.

105
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:25,380
But I'm lucky.

106
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,620
I remember once

107
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,520
when I failed an exam,

108
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:28,820
I was locked in a dark room.

109
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:31,140
(I was starving at the time.)

110
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,020
(And then)

111
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:33,859
(someone secretly gave me loquats.)

112
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:51,979
I really like

113
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,940
such a kind soul.

114
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,859
You like him

115
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:57,940
over some loquats?

116
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:03,820
It's me who gave you

117
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,820
those loquats.

118
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,539
So it was you, Huaijin.

119
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:15,380
I knew it.

120
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,500
You're the only one

121
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,339
I've ever been so in sync with.

122
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,380
You're truly a lifesaver.

123
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,060
Look at you.

124
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,419
How could you be last again?

125
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,700
Master Wei.

126
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,620
You taught us self-sacrifice.

127
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:32,779
If I don't endure hardship, who will?

128
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:33,552
You!

129
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:36,140
Hopeless.

130
00:07:37,764 --> 00:07:40,208
(Xianchang Academy)

131
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,299
What?

132
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:46,419
Can't you face me properly?

133
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,459
Xiao Jue.

134
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,380
You are my most proud student.

135
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:55,060
Why did you...?

136
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:56,659
Why did he end up liking me?

137
00:07:58,779 --> 00:07:59,740
A woman

138
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,779
disguised as a man

139
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:02,859
and studied here.

140
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:04,380
That was outrageous.

141
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:05,979
You even went

142
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:08,020
to join the military.

143
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,779
How absurd!

144
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,940
How immoral!

145
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:13,940
How rude!

146
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:17,060
Xiao Jue has always
maintained good conduct.

147
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:18,260
It must be you

148
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,820
who lured him astray.

149
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,219
- Master Wei.
- Master...

150
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:24,099
I fell for her first.

151
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,020
She is Wei's

152
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,099
first female general.

153
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:28,219
Frankly speaking,

154
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,620
I'm the lucky one.

155
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,620
You're a grown man.

156
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:34,060
Don't always talk

157
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:35,180
about love.

158
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,299
Beauty brings disaster.

159
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:39,419
So they are

160
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,740
General Feihong and Fengyun?

161
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,460
Yes!

162
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,380
I'll be a general too!

163
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,260
- Me too!
- I'll be a general!

164
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,020
Stop it!

165
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,699
Don't mess around.

166
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:48,899
Return to your studies!

167
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,059
- Yes.
- Yes.

168
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,899
He's a walking contradiction.

169
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,939
When he heard General Feihong

170
00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:54,860
was a woman,

171
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:55,939
he angrily removed

172
00:08:55,939 --> 00:08:56,579
the calligraphy

173
00:08:56,699 --> 00:08:57,980
she left during her studies.

174
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,899
But then he still

175
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,140
hung it back up.

176
00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:15,340
Huaijin.

177
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:16,500
Did you

178
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:18,140
take me here on purpose?

179
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:20,980
You're no longer

180
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,500
the problem student,

181
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:24,500
but the Xianchang Academy's pride.

182
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:28,419
However,

183
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:29,980
General Feihong,

184
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,059
to preserve your dignity,

185
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:34,340
should you study

186
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:35,699
and retake the exam?

187
00:09:38,372 --> 00:09:43,312
(He Rufei, C)

188
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,899
Retaking the exam for this

189
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,419
would be truly shameful.

190
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,659
Besides,

191
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,740
it's in the long past.

192
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:53,100
After joining the army,

193
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,059
I kept improving

194
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,860
and became a scholarly general.

195
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:58,059
I master the classics long ago.

196
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,460
The Virtue chapter?

197
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,980
Unshaken by external things.

198
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,220
How's it, father?

199
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:04,140
Did I do it well?

200
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,020
Huaijin, if you wish,

201
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,260
I can...

202
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,140
No need.

203
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,659
I mean,

204
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,340
to recite the Virtue chapter again.

205
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:15,699
What's on your mind?

206
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,460

This is my first time

at Yaojing's Lantern Festival.

215
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:07,460
It's much livelier than

216
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,260
Water God Festival!

217
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,020
Your wish to wander,

00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,419
my hand to hold.

219
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:21,260
Sugar figure.

220
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:22,288
Huaijin.

221
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,220
Want a sugar figure?

222
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:23,939
Buy you one.

223
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,819
Well,

224
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,579
one with a phoenix?

225
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:29,380
Or one with a Kylin?

226
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:32,080
No.

227
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:33,340
No?

228
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:34,980
I have money.

229
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:35,980
I'll buy you one.

230
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:38,100
No basket-shaped ones here.

231
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:42,899
You like baskets?

232
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:44,460
Someone made

233
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,860
a candy basket
for Mr. Chu in Jiyang City?

234
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:56,819
Are you

235
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,059
feeling jealous?

236
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:01,340
I never expected

237
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,380
that the mighty General Fengyun

238
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,059
would become so jealous.

239
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,699
I am jealous.

240
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,419
No matter how generous one is,

241
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,220
after falling for someone,

242
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:12,779
they'd be jealous easily.

243
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,740
Moreover,

244
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:17,659
he was up to something.

245
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:20,899
Back then,

246
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:22,539
he gave me a tassel.

247
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,899
You know

248
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:25,299
the hardest favors to repay

249
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:26,340
are kindness.

250
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:27,579
But

251
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,899
we are different.

252
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,380
We don't need

253
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:31,579
clear lines.

254
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:33,460
Just like you,

255
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:34,699
I'm also unwavering.

256
00:12:34,939 --> 00:12:36,059
I won't love other man.

257
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:38,896
Come on.

258
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:40,048
Sir.

259
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,260
One sugar figure.

260
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:42,579
May I draw it myself?

261
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:43,980
Of course.

262
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:45,712
Here.

263
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,408
Done!

264
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,539
You can stop

265
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:25,860
being jealous.

266
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:33,340
But

267
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,860
this might be too large.

268
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,460
It's hard to carry.

269
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,220
Don't worry, miss.

270
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,340
We can deliver it

271
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,340
to your mansion.

272
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,500
Really?

273
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,059
Thank you so much.

274
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,020
This one.

275
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:11,472
How is it?

276
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:13,980
General Yan.

277
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:16,496
He Yan.

278
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:18,620
What a rare sight!

279
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:19,779
Never expected you

280
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,380
to stroll through night markets.

281
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:23,179
This must be

282
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,980
you wife, right?

283
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:26,000
(Xia Chengxiu, Yan He's Wife)

284
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,579
In Rundu,

285
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,860
General Yan mentioned you often.

286
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,140
And this

287
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,659
must be General He.

288
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,419
I've long heard of your fame.

289
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,620
Enough with the formalities.

290
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,460
Xiao Jue, you're here
for the lantern riddles too?

291
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,819
Then go solve

292
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:43,620
the riddles.

293
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,179
Look how many I've solved already.

294
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:47,939
He's not solving them,

295
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:48,939
but

296
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:51,260
I'll solve one for him.

297
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,620
Xiu, I want you to solve one for me too.

298
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:57,712
Alright.

299
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,579
Pick one.

300
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,824
(Lantern Riddles)

301
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,419
The blue one then.

302
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:11,380
This character is remarkable
with four strokes...

303
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,699
Where should I hang this lantern?

304
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,779
What's the perfect spot?

305
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:19,740
Here then.

306
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:21,899
Even sages would bow before it.

307
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:22,860
Wait!

308
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:28,179
Ten and one at the bottom,
and three on top.

309
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:29,899
It's "Lei".

310
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,260
Brilliant, miss!

311
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,340
This lantern is yours.

312
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:35,760
Thank you.

313
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:40,976
Sir.

314
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:42,260
Why is

315
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,380
hers nicer than mine?

316
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:46,939
Sir!

317
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:11,059

321
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,340
we're especially lucky today?

322
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,059
Indeed.

00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,900
you even make Feinu
release Kongming lanterns?

389
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:43,500
How thoughtful.

390
00:20:44,964 --> 00:20:46,903
♪Chasing the light within my heart♪

391
00:20:47,087 --> 00:20:50,911
♪Burying frailty,
embracing life through death♪

392
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:56,919
♪You'll meet gazes where storms brew♪

393
00:20:57,808 --> 00:21:02,020
♪With our unwavering true love,
brave the world with me♪

394
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,472
(Chu Mansion)

395
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,379
This was a gift from her.

396
00:21:08,139 --> 00:21:08,819
She said,

397
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:11,260
"Zilan" means nobility and purity.

398
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,859
Only those who love me

399
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,619
would give me such a name.

400
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,619
She gifted this to me.

401
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,220
She must have loved me.

402
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:27,900
Young Master,

403
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,740
look at this lantern.

404
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:31,139
Young Master.

405
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:39,539
(She loves me.)

406
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:41,420
She loves me.

407
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:44,220
She must have loved me.

408
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,379
Why did it shatter?

409
00:21:47,859 --> 00:21:48,539
Why?

410
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,579
Why must it be

411
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:50,819
the very gift from her?

412
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,579
Young Master.

413
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:53,139
Why?

414
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:54,220
Why?

415
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,260
Why can't I

416
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,420
ever have anything I desire?

417
00:21:59,339 --> 00:21:59,952
Young Master.

418
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,020
It's fate.

419
00:22:01,139 --> 00:22:02,020
Why force it?

420
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:05,980
Young Master.

421
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:07,376
Young Master.

422
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:25,379
Then you'll draft

423
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:26,619
the edict.

424
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,180
Understood.

425
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:34,579
The plum blossoms in the tiny vase

426
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,779
radiate such vibrant fragrance.

427
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,099
Indeed.

428
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,819
This year's plum blooms

429
00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:42,099
are really splendid.

430
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,180
Quite true.

431
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:45,980
The plum tree south of the city

432
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,099
is also in full bloom.

433
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:48,379
Yesterday,

434
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,460
General Fengyun went to pluck blossoms

435
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,500
for a young lady.

436
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,339
Xiao Jue?

437
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,059
For which young lady?

438
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,420
She is

439
00:22:57,579 --> 00:22:59,260
no ordinary lady,

440
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:01,180
but General Feihong.

441
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:02,900
This

442
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:04,900
has become a romantic legend.

443
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:07,020
All agree the two generals

444
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,940
are destined.

445
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:10,539
Young nobles and ladies

446
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:11,379
now visit

447
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:12,980
the plum trees in pairs

448
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:15,020
to pray for blessings.

449
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,779
Indeed.

450
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:20,859
Fengyun and Feihong

451
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,819
truly make a peerless pair.

452
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,379
He Yan and Xiao Jue

453
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:25,819
make a peerless pair.

454
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,740
But General Feihong

455
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,099
and General Fengyun

456
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:31,220
can't be a good match.

457
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,980
What's different?

458
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,339
General Feihong and Fengyun

459
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,500
hold strong military forces.

460
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:02,059
It's quite special to be

461
00:24:03,139 --> 00:24:04,099
on the rooftop at night.

462
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,379
When I was young,

463
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:07,859
before joining the army,

464
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:09,420
I loved the rooftops.

465
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,020
He Mansion's rooftop

466
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,220
was even higher.

467
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,139
My martial arts were poor.

468
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:16,059
I could only climb using ladders.

469
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:18,059
Once when I was halfway up,

470
00:24:18,339 --> 00:24:19,059
I fell down.

471
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,260
Afraid of being noticed,

472
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,260
I didn't shout out.

473
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:24,139
For a long time after,

474
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,339
my back kept hurting.

475
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:28,139
Why love being on the rooftops?

476
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,859
Because they are high enough

477
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,619
to reach for the moon

478
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,619
and pluck stars

479
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,180
from the sky.

480
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,059
Childish.

481
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,099
What?

482
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,420
Everyone was so.

483
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,299
If you like it,

484
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,059
every rooftop in my mansion

485
00:24:52,579 --> 00:24:53,180
will be yours.

486
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:55,379
Even after marriage,

487
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:55,859
okay?

488
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:56,784
Okay.

489
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:58,539
We'll climb together,

490
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,180
okay?

491
00:24:59,299 --> 00:24:59,920
Okay.

492
00:25:01,379 --> 00:25:02,579
If we need to bring snacks...

493
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:03,500
As long as you like it,

494
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:04,740
I'm okay.

495
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,180
What's funny?

496
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,779
I was thinking

497
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:16,859
the mighty General Fengyun

498
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:18,980
would climb roofs with me.

499
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:20,299
Moreover,

500
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,339
I regain control of the Fuyue Army.

501
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:24,339
You and the Xiao Army

502
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,819
might become obsolete.

503
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,180
Nothing keeping you busy?

504
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,180
Such bold words.

505
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:33,859
It matters not.

506
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:36,059
Merit determines

507
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:37,539
position.

508
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,460
I won't show any mercy.

509
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,420
Likewise.

510
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:44,779
Instead of this talk,

511
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,299
let's discuss

512
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,579
our wedding.

513
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,579
I've hired

514
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:52,059
Yaojing's best embroiderers

515
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,139
to make the bridal gown.

516
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,139
So soon?

517
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:57,619
Soon?

518
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:00,779
I think it's too slow.

519
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,660
Actually,

520
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,020
I feel the same.

521
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,099
I'll measure your shoulders.

522
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,379
Note this down.

523
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:39,460
Miss, raise your arm.

524
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,339
(You are a woman,)

525
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,579
(yet fight on the battlefields,)

526
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,020
(outshining all men.)

527
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,619
(You deserve)

528
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:01,980
(the title of)

529
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,339
(General Feihong.)

530
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,180
Why do you keep staring at me?

531
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:09,579
Beautiful.

532
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,859
You'll look even more stunning

533
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,859
in the wedding dress.

534
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:16,020
Why am I the only one being measured?

535
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,059
Marriage

536
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,500
is about us two.

537
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,568
Yes.

538
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:20,819
I need it too.

539
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,059
I want you to.

540
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,379
Me?

541
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:40,900
Your shoulders

542
00:27:41,379 --> 00:27:42,619
are much broader than mine.

543
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:43,819
The waist.

544
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,256
Waist?

545
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,700
Measure with hands.

546
00:28:47,379 --> 00:28:48,980
By the imperial decree,

547
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,579
summon General Fengyun Xiao Jue

548
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,579
to the palace.

549
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:06,420
Your Majesty.

550
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,299
Commander Xiao is here.

551
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:11,539
I'm Xiao Jue.

552
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:12,660
Greetings.

553
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:13,776
Rise.

554
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,579
I summoned you urgently

555
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:17,379
due to emerging circumstances.

556
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:18,940
Are the Wutuo people

557
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:20,460
making any movements?

558
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,584
Exactly.

559
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,020
I got tips from the border.

560
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:27,260
The Wutuo King had passed away.

561
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,940
His son succeeded the throne.

562
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,619
But his son

563
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:31,619
is too young.

564
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:33,379
While his uncle

565
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,180
has strong military forces,

566
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,299
eyeing covetously.

567
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,660
The officials

568
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,260
are divided into two factions.

569
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,020
The Wutuo

570
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,539
could erupt into civil war any moment.

571
00:29:45,379 --> 00:29:46,819
The uncle has accumulated authority.

572
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,619
Usurping the throne
is just a matter of time.

573
00:29:50,139 --> 00:29:51,339
To get more power,

574
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,819
given his warlike nature,

575
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,779
he'll surely invade the Wei.

576
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,980
You are absolutely right.

577
00:29:59,099 --> 00:29:59,819
Therefore,

578
00:30:00,379 --> 00:30:02,220
we shouldn't just watch idly.

579
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:03,740
Instead, we must prepare

580
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,740
in advance.

581
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,299
I think

582
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:07,660
we should discuss this with

583
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:08,819
General Feihong too.

584
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:20,099
Generals Fengyun and Feihong

585
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:22,900
are the twin stars of Wei.

586
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,379
With both of you here,

587
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:27,539
I can rest easy.

588
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:29,339
I'm flattered.

589
00:30:30,139 --> 00:30:30,940
It's our duty

590
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,940
to protect the nation.

591
00:30:33,579 --> 00:30:34,740
I heard

592
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,500
you gifted plum blossoms to He Yan.

593
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:41,420
Your Majesty,

594
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,460
He Yan and I

595
00:30:44,339 --> 00:30:45,220
love each other.

596
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,420
We agreed...

597
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,779
Your Majesty,
Mr. Chu Zhao requests audience.

598
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,859
Let him in.

599
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:54,160
Yes.

600
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,180
By the imperial decree,

601
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,339
summon Mr. Chu Zhao!

602
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,779
- Your Majesty.
- Rise.

603
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,020
What brings you here?

604
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:11,500
I come here

605
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:13,579
for personal matters.

606
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,339
Why be so formal?

607
00:31:24,379 --> 00:31:25,980
I've long admired a lady.

608
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:28,379
I boldly implore you to issue

609
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:29,740
a marriage decree.

610
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,500
Please grant me.

611
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,819
I see.

612
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:36,500
Which lady you admire?

613
00:31:36,819 --> 00:31:37,700
Tell me.

614
00:31:39,339 --> 00:31:40,059
He Yan.

615
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,299
You want to marry He Yan?

616
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:46,940
- Yes.
- No way!

617
00:31:57,819 --> 00:31:58,384
Your Majesty,

618
00:31:59,379 --> 00:32:00,740
He Yan and I are engaged.

619
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,420
And we're about to marry.

620
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,940
Without proper betrothal rites,

621
00:32:07,379 --> 00:32:08,579
can you call it engagement?

622
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,740
Your Majesty,

623
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:15,940
I love He Yan...

624
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:17,539
I know.

625
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,260
You and He Yan

626
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:24,139
can marry.

627
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,619
But

628
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,579
General Fengyun and General Feihong

629
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:31,539
cannot.

630
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:35,740
Your Majesty.

631
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,859
I don't want to split lovebirds,

632
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,700
but I have my considerations.

633
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,099
If you insist on marrying He Yan,

634
00:32:43,579 --> 00:32:44,339
I won't stop you.

635
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,980
But one of you

636
00:32:47,619 --> 00:32:49,139
must surrender

637
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:52,260
your military authority.

638
00:33:17,379 --> 00:33:17,980
Commander Xiao,

639
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:20,059
you fought so hard

640
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,819
to clear your father's name.

641
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:22,819
And the Xiao Army

642
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,500
barely regained

643
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,500
morale.

644
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:26,500
No one else

645
00:33:26,859 --> 00:33:28,059
can command them.

646
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,059
Think it over.

647
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,579
Tomorrow,

648
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:47,859
tell me your answer.

649
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:55,339
Besides,

650
00:33:56,339 --> 00:33:57,819
no outsiders shall know

651
00:33:58,299 --> 00:33:59,740
about this matter.

652
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,779
Understood.

653
00:34:35,259 --> 00:34:35,940
I admit.

654
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,300
I'm trying to

655
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,340
steal He Yan from you.

656
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,940
But concentrating

657
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,500
military power has been taboo.

658
00:34:44,259 --> 00:34:45,139
He Yan suffered

659
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:46,059
so much pain

660
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:46,980
to reclaim her identity

661
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:48,500
as General Feihong.

662
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,139
Can you watch her give up

663
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,659
everything for you?

664
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:54,659
And how could you

665
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,940
betray your late father

666
00:34:56,579 --> 00:34:57,900
and abandon the Xiao Army

667
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,059
he entrusted to you?

668
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:04,699
Xiao Jue,

669
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,259
just admit it.

670
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:07,860
You

671
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,420
and He Yan aren't destined.

672
00:35:11,259 --> 00:35:12,259
You and her

673
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:14,179
cannot be together.

674
00:35:58,659 --> 00:35:59,739
What took you so long?

675
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:01,139
What did His Majesty say?

676
00:36:02,139 --> 00:36:03,579
The Wutuo King suddenly passed away,

677
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,340
succeeded by his young son.

678
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,739
Wutuo King's brother

679
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:08,539
is eyeing the throne for usurpation.

680
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,300
His Majesty fears

681
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:11,780
the Wutuo's civil war

682
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,820
will endanger

683
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,780
the Wei.

684
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:15,820
Therefore,

685
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,940
we must prepare in advance.

686
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,380
True.

687
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,460
We need to stay alert

688
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,259
of the cunning Wutuo people.

689
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,539
But,

690
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,579
for such crucial matters,

691
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:29,579
why did

692
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,659
His Majesty only summon you?

693
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:41,820
Next time,

694
00:36:43,364 --> 00:36:44,464
His Majesty will summon you

695
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:46,219
to discuss this.

696
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,340
Excellent.

697
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,219
As the General Feihong,

698
00:36:56,059 --> 00:36:57,380
you must soar freely

699
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,900
in the sky.

700
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,020
Young Master,

701
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,420
eat something.

702
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:54,340
I'm not hungry.

703
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,780
Leave now.

704
00:38:00,099 --> 00:38:01,860
If you've made up your mind,

705
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,699
why being so troubled?

706
00:38:08,259 --> 00:38:09,300
I am troubled?

707
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,619
Having served you for so long,

708
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:17,259
I can tell

709
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:19,420
you're troubled.

710
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:26,139
You resemble

711
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,259
glacial ice,

712
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,980
crystal clear,

713
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,259
yet chillingly cold.

714
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,500
Miss He

715
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,860
resembles fire,

716
00:38:38,139 --> 00:38:39,059
shining brightly,

717
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:41,820
yet scorching

718
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,940
when you get close.

719
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:46,579
Today, you've spoken

720
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:48,780
too much.

721
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:54,099
I'm sorry.

722
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:56,579
Please eat.

723
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,259
Ice and fire cannot be together.

724
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,820
So what?

725
00:39:24,419 --> 00:39:28,400

726
00:39:36,099 --> 00:39:39,344

736
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,940
(I believe I was born)

737
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,980
to be a general.

738
00:39:56,739 --> 00:39:58,099
Sometimes, I even feel

739
00:39:58,736 --> 00:40:00,420
I was a female general in my past life.

740
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,099
Impressive, right?

741

You know why I let you lead them?

742
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:06,699
