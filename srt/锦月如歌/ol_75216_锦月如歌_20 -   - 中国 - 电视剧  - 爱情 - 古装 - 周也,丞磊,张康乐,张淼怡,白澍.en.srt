Attack!

25
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:01,443
Sweetie.

26
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:02,804
This pot looks pretty heavy.

27
00:03:03,364 --> 00:03:05,364
If the Wutuo forces really break in,

28
00:03:05,608 --> 00:03:06,524
can you even swing it?

29
00:03:07,844 --> 00:03:08,684
No, I can't.

30
00:03:08,684 --> 00:03:09,524
But I'll throw it

31
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,524
at them.

32
00:03:11,084 --> 00:03:12,763
Killing one enemy is good.

33
00:03:12,964 --> 00:03:13,804
Killing two

34
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:15,084
is better.

35
00:03:19,603 --> 00:03:20,443
With enemies coming,

36
00:03:20,804 --> 00:03:21,923
we must stand united.

37
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,163
Jiyang is my home.

38
00:03:23,883 --> 00:03:24,763
If home is gone,

39
00:03:25,603 --> 00:03:26,923
what's the point of living?

40
00:03:27,404 --> 00:03:28,244
Exactly.

41
00:03:28,244 --> 00:03:30,088
My brother and father are
on the battlefield.

42
00:03:30,203 --> 00:03:32,084
I want to cheer them in victory.

43
00:03:32,524 --> 00:03:33,524
You're right.

44
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:34,804
Women

45
00:03:35,124 --> 00:03:36,364
should also be tough.

46
00:03:36,763 --> 00:03:38,443
If officials' families only

47
00:03:38,524 --> 00:03:39,524
want self-preservation,

48
00:03:40,163 --> 00:03:41,443
how can we expect soldiers

49
00:03:41,564 --> 00:03:42,684
to fight on the front lines?

50
00:03:43,883 --> 00:03:45,084
Let's fight enemies!

51
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:47,564
- Sure!
- Let's fight them!

52
00:04:49,787 --> 00:04:52,104
(Compassionate Salvation)

53
00:04:52,136 --> 00:04:54,296
(Radiant Illumination)

54
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:12,923
Who are you?

55
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:19,443
That's not important. Attack!

56
00:05:55,403 --> 00:05:56,484
Charge!

57
00:05:57,564 --> 00:05:58,404
(Three Passes)
Fire arrows!

58
00:06:01,763 --> 00:06:02,603
Feinu.

59
00:06:03,124 --> 00:06:04,648
You lead the vanguard out of the city.

60
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:06,124
Muyi will lead Jiyang troops

61
00:06:06,203 --> 00:06:07,043
to guard the gate.

62
00:06:07,443 --> 00:06:08,924
Not a single Wutuo man

63
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:11,083
shall enter Jiyang!

64
00:06:11,523 --> 00:06:12,643
- Understood!
- Understood!

65
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:20,644
Once the gate opens,

66
00:06:21,124 --> 00:06:23,124
lead the main force
against the Wutuo army first.

67
00:06:24,203 --> 00:06:25,443
Then I'll take an elite squad

68
00:06:26,524 --> 00:06:28,364
to divert Huyate
and his heavy armor troops,

69
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,048
luring them away
from the main battlefield.

70
00:06:31,443 --> 00:06:32,643
The remaining Wutuo forces

71
00:06:33,403 --> 00:06:34,484
will be leaderless.

72
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,204
Commander.

73
00:06:38,684 --> 00:06:39,804
Let me lead the elite squad

74
00:06:40,203 --> 00:06:42,083
to lure away Huyate and his heavy armor.

75
00:06:43,124 --> 00:06:43,964
No.

76
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:45,283
To divert Huyate,

77
00:06:45,283 --> 00:06:46,924
we need someone of high standing.

78
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:48,684
The Wutuo loathe me.

79
00:06:49,684 --> 00:06:50,524
Therefore,

80
00:06:51,403 --> 00:06:52,604
I'm the right one.

81
00:06:53,763 --> 00:06:55,244
Actually, in Jiyang, there is someone

82
00:06:56,523 --> 00:06:57,364
of higher standing

83
00:06:57,763 --> 00:06:58,763
than you.

84
00:07:04,283 --> 00:07:05,123
Quick!

85
00:07:24,963 --> 00:07:26,600
You want to impersonate Princess Mengji?

86
00:07:27,244 --> 00:07:28,084
Yes.

87
00:07:39,883 --> 00:07:41,364
Do you understand the risks?

88
00:07:43,283 --> 00:07:44,244
I do,

89
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,523
so I can't let you go.

90
00:07:48,403 --> 00:07:49,804
As our commander-in-chief,

91
00:07:50,724 --> 00:07:52,203
the entire army's fate relies on you.

92
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:55,283
You can't take unnecessary risks.

93
00:08:00,004 --> 00:08:00,844
I know you are

94
00:08:01,643 --> 00:08:02,843
worried about my safety.

95
00:08:03,843 --> 00:08:05,203
But you must realize

96
00:08:06,044 --> 00:08:07,403
that once I wear this armor,

97
00:08:08,244 --> 00:08:09,443
I become a soldier,

98
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,403
fearless of death.

99
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,004
Medic!

100
00:08:18,923 --> 00:08:19,763
Come quickly!

101
00:08:19,763 --> 00:08:20,603
There's another one!

102
00:08:20,604 --> 00:08:21,444
Hurry!

103
00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:23,684
Move faster!

104
00:08:23,924 --> 00:08:24,883
He Yan, receive orders!

105
00:08:28,323 --> 00:08:29,203
Come back alive.

106
00:08:31,124 --> 00:08:32,004
Yes!

107
00:08:46,763 --> 00:08:47,603
Quickly!

108
00:08:48,084 --> 00:08:48,924
Medic!

109
00:08:50,084 --> 00:08:50,924
Medic!

110
00:08:51,604 --> 00:08:52,444
Hurry!

111
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:54,004
He's dying!

112
00:08:54,004 --> 00:08:54,844
Let me check.

113
00:09:04,204 --> 00:09:05,044
Faster!

114
00:09:07,324 --> 00:09:08,164
This will hurt.

115
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:13,123
Bear with it.

116
00:09:19,844 --> 00:09:20,684
Alright.

117
00:10:04,923 --> 00:10:05,763
Prepare the horses!

118
00:10:05,763 --> 00:10:06,603
Yes!

119
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:13,604
Charge!

120
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:17,324
- Attack!
- Attack!

121
00:10:47,816 --> 00:10:49,084
Whoever captures Xiao Jue alive

122
00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:51,923
will be handsomely rewarded.

123
00:10:52,484 --> 00:10:53,364
- Attack!
- Attack!

124
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,403
Attack!

125
00:11:43,563 --> 00:11:45,124
Mu Hongjin is trying to escape.

126
00:11:45,283 --> 00:11:47,283
Heavy infantry! Capture her alive!

127
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:09,084
(He Yan.)

128
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:11,004
(You must return safely.)

129
00:12:28,283 --> 00:12:29,364
Seize Mu Hongjin!

130
00:12:29,563 --> 00:12:30,484
Don't let her escape!

131
00:12:46,323 --> 00:12:47,163
(Wutuo forces)

132
00:12:47,163 --> 00:12:48,523
(are accustomed to land battles.)

133
00:12:48,763 --> 00:12:50,364
(Horses aren't water-adept.)

134
00:12:50,364 --> 00:12:51,883
There's a riverbank east of the city.

135
00:12:52,403 --> 00:12:53,364
It's a risky move.

136
00:12:53,643 --> 00:12:54,643
Destroy the leader first.

137
00:12:55,204 --> 00:12:56,124
Capture Huyate,

138
00:12:56,364 --> 00:12:58,004
and the battle can turn around.

139
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,324
You're not Mu Hongjin.

140
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:28,084
Trash like you

141
00:13:28,283 --> 00:13:29,844
isn't worth Her Highness' effort.

142
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,163
You're courting death.

143
00:14:07,163 --> 00:14:08,683
You're seeking death!

144
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:11,444
I'm killing you at any cost.

145
00:14:26,844 --> 00:14:27,763
(Chai Anxi?)

146
00:14:49,844 --> 00:14:50,844
I just spotted Chai Anxi.

147
00:14:50,964 --> 00:14:51,804
But he vanished.

148
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,384
You must find him.

149
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:54,684
Yes.

150
00:15:45,204 --> 00:15:46,124
(Dear sister,)

151
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:49,563
(I gave you mercy.)

152
00:15:50,364 --> 00:15:51,803
(Yet you rejected it.)

153
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:53,724
(You let me down.)

154
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:54,952
(Bring honor to our family?)

155
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,324
(You don't deserve to do that.)

156
00:15:56,324 --> 00:15:58,283
(My family needs only one heir.)

157
00:15:58,364 --> 00:15:59,444
(Prepare to die!)

158
00:15:59,964 --> 00:16:01,163
(Prepare to die!)

159
00:16:02,163 --> 00:16:04,163
(Our family doesn't need you.)

160
00:16:04,244 --> 00:16:05,283
(Your death)

161
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:07,763
(will ensure our family's peace.)

162
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:11,603
Commander.

163
00:17:12,283 --> 00:17:14,323
Commander, have we won?

164
00:17:17,523 --> 00:17:18,363
Listen.

165
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,083
We've won.

166
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:23,724
- We've won!
- We've won!

167
00:17:29,843 --> 00:17:30,684
Great!

168
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:32,244
We've won.

169
00:17:36,644 --> 00:17:37,484
Indeed.

170
00:17:39,204 --> 00:17:40,044
We've won.

171
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:42,524

00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,123
I found Mr. Liu's body near the mansion.

227
00:20:40,684 --> 00:20:43,164
There were many Wutuo men's bodies
surrounding him.

228
00:20:44,004 --> 00:20:45,444
Their weapons were poisonous.

229
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,363
Mr. Liu was fatally poisoned.

230
00:20:47,363 --> 00:20:48,392
Enemies outnumbered him.

231
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:49,884

00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:58,164
My master?

233
00:21:00,004 --> 00:21:00,844
That's not true.

234
00:21:04,283 --> 00:21:05,363
My master couldn't have...

235
00:21:50,563 --> 00:21:52,523
(This pair of bracelets
is called Joyful Hearts.)

236
00:21:53,323 --> 00:21:55,752
Lovers wearing them

237
00:21:56,244 --> 00:21:57,523
will never be parted.

238
00:21:59,603 --> 00:22:01,123
Is this your beloved?

239
00:22:03,644 --> 00:22:05,083
(Buy a pair for the lady.)

240
00:22:05,523 --> 00:22:07,884
You two will be together forever.

241
00:22:08,763 --> 00:22:09,763
Did you hear that?

242
00:22:10,323 --> 00:22:11,432
Aren't you buying me this?

243
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,204
She's not my beloved.

244
00:22:32,283 --> 00:22:33,363
Liar.

245
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:35,924

00:22:45,724 --> 00:22:46,564
Are you upset?

248
00:22:46,964 --> 00:22:47,848

328
00:28:31,323 --> 00:28:32,163

to let it go,

345
00:30:02,684 --> 00:30:03,603
what else can we do?

346
00:30:07,803 --> 00:30:08,763
Mr. Liu was

347
00:30:09,603 --> 00:30:10,523
free and unrestrained.

348
00:30:12,123 --> 00:30:13,444
If he saw you grieving like this,

349
00:30:14,123 --> 00:30:15,283
he would worry about you.

350
00:30:16,563 --> 00:30:17,403
The living

351
00:30:18,164 --> 00:30:19,363
must move on.

352
00:30:21,323 --> 00:30:22,204
They say

353
00:30:23,484 --> 00:30:24,404
that the deceased

354
00:30:25,404 --> 00:30:26,924
would cross the River of Forgetfulness

355
00:30:27,763 --> 00:30:28,872
to reach the other shore.

356
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:32,484
But what's it like

357
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,204
across the river?

358
00:31:03,684 --> 00:31:04,524
Master.

359
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,404
According to Jiyang's customs,

360
00:31:08,123 --> 00:31:08,963
tonight,

361
00:31:09,444 --> 00:31:10,763
the family should prepare food

362
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:12,644
to send off the departed.

363
00:31:14,444 --> 00:31:15,284
I have

364
00:31:15,603 --> 00:31:17,763

All is well.

368
00:31:23,563 --> 00:31:24,403
And everyone is safe.

369
00:31:26,444 --> 00:31:27,363
Master.

370
00:31:28,843 --> 00:31:30,083
May you rest in peace.

Your Highness.

374
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:02,283
I brought some dishes for your master.

375
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:16,404
After all these years,

376
00:32:17,523 --> 00:32:19,683
your master's taste in food
remains unchanged.

377
00:32:24,603 --> 00:32:25,563
Sweet and sour fish.

378
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:27,164
You didn't put any sugar

379
00:32:27,563 --> 00:32:29,004
in this dish?

380
00:32:29,724 --> 00:32:30,684
My master

381
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:34,083
loved sugarless sweet and sour fish.

382
00:32:34,884 --> 00:32:37,123
He never put sugar in it.

383
00:32:37,603 --> 00:32:38,843
I used to tease him

384
00:32:39,523 --> 00:32:41,763
that it was sweet and sour fish
without sugar,

385
00:32:42,123 --> 00:32:44,244
and he could eat sour fish.

386
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:46,283
Only later did I know

387
00:32:47,123 --> 00:32:48,283
it was because the one

388
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:50,563
my master had been missing

389
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,843
liked

390
00:32:53,363 --> 00:32:54,884
to eat sugarless sweet and sour fish.

391
00:32:58,563 --> 00:32:59,403
I always knew

392
00:33:00,323 --> 00:33:01,444
he liked me.

393
00:33:03,803 --> 00:33:04,884
I refused to meet him

394
00:33:05,724 --> 00:33:06,964
because he broke his promise.

395
00:33:12,563 --> 00:33:13,484
But the bracelet

396
00:33:13,484 --> 00:33:14,324
made me realize

397
00:33:14,603 --> 00:33:16,004
he must have had his reasons.

398
00:33:16,603 --> 00:33:17,644
Thinking about it now,

399
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:19,603
what difference would it make?

400
00:33:20,244 --> 00:33:23,204
I'm Mu Hongjin of the Mengji Mansion.

401
00:33:23,724 --> 00:33:25,244
I'm Mu Hongjin of Jiyang.

402
00:33:25,884 --> 00:33:26,724
I could never

403
00:33:27,684 --> 00:33:29,204
be his Mu Hongjin.

404
00:33:33,164 --> 00:33:34,004
He Yan.

405
00:33:34,484 --> 00:33:36,164
Fate didn't bind me to your master,

406
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:37,644
but I've genuinely

407
00:33:37,884 --> 00:33:39,404
come to regard you as family.

408
00:33:40,244 --> 00:33:41,724
My greatest regret

409
00:33:42,043 --> 00:33:43,164
is that I didn't go out

410
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:45,803
to meet him that night.

411
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:49,323
Even just a glimpse from afar

412
00:33:50,204 --> 00:33:51,044
would be better.

413
00:33:57,964 --> 00:33:59,724
Cherish the one you like.

414
00:34:00,803 --> 00:34:01,803
Don't repeat the mistake

415
00:34:02,444 --> 00:34:03,964
your master and I made.

416
00:34:05,803 --> 00:34:06,724
It's lucky

417
00:34:07,323 --> 00:34:08,804
to meet the one you love

418
00:34:08,884 --> 00:34:10,484
in your life.

419
00:34:11,444 --> 00:34:12,603
Once you find the right one,

420
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:14,723
don't let him go.

421
00:34:15,563 --> 00:34:16,683
Give him a chance

422
00:34:17,163 --> 00:34:18,003
and trust him.

423
00:34:18,764 --> 00:34:20,123
It also means a chance for you.

424
00:34:25,924 --> 00:34:26,924
I see, Your Highness.

425
00:34:49,043 --> 00:34:49,883
Commander.

426
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:50,923
Why are you here?

427
00:34:51,603 --> 00:34:52,443
Once you returned,

428
00:34:52,643 --> 00:34:53,844
you went to restaurants,

429
00:34:54,324 --> 00:34:55,563
preparing food for Mr. Liu.

430
00:34:56,523 --> 00:34:57,523
But you eat nothing.

431
00:35:14,243 --> 00:35:15,083
Let's eat together.

432
00:35:45,803 --> 00:35:46,643
Sir.

433
00:35:46,643 --> 00:35:48,243
Xiao Jue has taken Chai Anxi back.

434
00:35:48,243 --> 00:35:49,563
Chai Anxi is now unconscious.

435
00:35:49,884 --> 00:35:51,203
He's now at the Cui Mansion.

436
00:35:51,484 --> 00:35:52,603
Cheng Lisu and Song Taotao

437
00:35:52,603 --> 00:35:53,443
are treating him.

438
00:35:53,563 --> 00:35:54,764
Chancellor Xu sent a letter,

439
00:35:54,764 --> 00:35:56,136
urging you to act quickly.

440
00:35:56,136 --> 00:35:57,924
Should I go kill Chai Anxi now?

441
00:35:58,043 --> 00:35:58,883
I suspect

442
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:00,804
Chai Anxi holds crucial information.

443
00:36:01,323 --> 00:36:03,003
So, I need to verify details with him.

444
00:36:04,004 --> 00:36:05,404
Have you noticed something?

445
00:36:05,444 --> 00:36:06,284
Chai Anxi

446
00:36:06,284 --> 00:36:07,720
was Xiao Zhongwu's deputy general.

447
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:09,843
He faked his death
after the Mingshui Battle.

448
00:36:09,843 --> 00:36:12,163
Xiao Jue's search for him
is understandable.

449
00:36:13,163 --> 00:36:14,404
But to kill him,

450
00:36:14,804 --> 00:36:15,764
Chancellor Xu sent me

451
00:36:16,523 --> 00:36:17,603
and even contacted Wutuo.

452
00:36:18,484 --> 00:36:19,523
It makes me realize

453
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,043
that he and Chai Anxi must

454
00:36:21,284 --> 00:36:22,124
share a dark history.

455
00:36:22,603 --> 00:36:23,523
Are you suspecting

456
00:36:23,784 --> 00:36:26,083
Chancellor Xu is related
to the Mingshui Battle's defeat?

457
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,603
We'll know the answer

458
00:36:28,163 --> 00:36:29,484
when Chai Anxi wakes.

459
00:36:30,484 --> 00:36:31,924
Chai Anxi knows you.

460
00:36:32,683 --> 00:36:33,523
If he wakes,

461
00:36:33,643 --> 00:36:35,123
will he implicate you?

462
00:36:35,324 --> 00:36:36,164
No.

463
00:36:36,683 --> 00:36:38,083
Chai Anxi values loyalty.

464
00:36:38,164 --> 00:36:39,004
He'd never

465
00:36:39,004 --> 00:36:40,884
betray his lifesaver.

466
00:36:41,404 --> 00:36:42,244
Moreover,

467
00:36:43,203 --> 00:36:44,284
even if he says something,

468
00:36:44,964 --> 00:36:46,404
I have contingency plans.

469
00:36:47,723 --> 00:36:49,484
Now that Chai Anxi's at the Cui Mansion,

470
00:36:50,004 --> 00:36:51,404
as an Inspector,

471
00:36:51,844 --> 00:36:52,764
I should pay a visit.

472
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:20,884
Though Chai Anxi's life is stabilized,

473
00:37:21,043 --> 00:37:22,004
his injuries are severe.

474
00:37:22,603 --> 00:37:24,008
Song Taotao is preparing medicine.

475
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:25,124
I'll leave it to you.

476
00:37:28,043 --> 00:37:28,883
Chu Zhao?

477
00:37:29,924 --> 00:37:30,764
What brings you here?

478
00:37:40,924 --> 00:37:41,764
Commander Xiao.

479
00:37:45,324 --> 00:37:46,603
I heard General Fengyun

480
00:37:46,844 --> 00:37:47,764
found a soldier

481
00:37:48,243 --> 00:37:49,203
who supposedly died

482
00:37:49,243 --> 00:37:50,203
at the Mingshui Battle.

483
00:37:50,723 --> 00:37:52,083
I wonder why a dead man

484
00:37:52,324 --> 00:37:53,404
came back to life.

485
00:37:53,884 --> 00:37:55,243
It's pretty strange.

486
00:37:55,603 --> 00:37:57,004
As an Inspector,

487
00:37:57,404 --> 00:37:58,404
I must figure this out.

488
00:37:59,123 --> 00:37:59,964
It made sense.

489
00:38:00,964 --> 00:38:02,043
I just found this man

490
00:38:02,523 --> 00:38:03,683
and wanted to inform you.

491
00:38:04,043 --> 00:38:04,883
But unexpectedly,

492
00:38:05,163 --> 00:38:06,004
you came.

493
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,404
You are

494
00:38:08,924 --> 00:38:10,004
so well-informed.

495
00:38:12,163 --> 00:38:13,083
I have to be alert

496
00:38:13,404 --> 00:38:14,844
as His Majesty's courtier.

497
00:38:16,764 --> 00:38:17,844
He remains unconscious,

498
00:38:18,203 --> 00:38:19,243
so we can't question him.

499
00:38:19,243 --> 00:38:20,083
However,

500
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:21,163
Cheng Lisu and Song Taotao

501
00:38:21,444 --> 00:38:22,723
are trying to treat him.

502
00:38:23,123 --> 00:38:23,963
When he wakes,

503
00:38:24,563 --> 00:38:25,764
you'll be informed.

504
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:27,723
Thanks, Commander Xiao.

505
00:38:28,284 --> 00:38:29,603
I'll take my leave.

506
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:32,443
See you.

507
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:34,443
See you.

508
00:38:40,884 --> 00:38:41,724
Commander.

509
00:38:41,844 --> 00:38:43,243
Why share details with him?

510
00:38:43,924 --> 00:38:45,004
He's Xu Jingfu's disciple.

511
00:38:45,603 --> 00:38:46,723
He's up to no good.

512
00:38:47,884 --> 00:38:49,163
His official position

513
00:38:49,844 --> 00:38:50,764
grants him authority.

514
00:38:51,843 --> 00:38:53,523
Avoidance won't work.

515
00:38:55,804 --> 00:38:56,644
Post more guards

516
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:57,923
around the courtyard.

517
00:38:58,683 --> 00:38:59,683
Prevent the opponents

518
00:39:00,284 --> 00:39:01,124
from breaking in.

519
00:39:02,004 --> 00:39:02,844
Yes.
