00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,041
Let's go.

24
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:28,041
Look at this.

25
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:28,840
So beautiful!

26
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,560
Truly lovely.

27
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,321
Where are

28
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:34,921
Mr. Cheng and Miss Song?

29
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,840
They must've seen something

30
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,000
delicious or entertaining.

31
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,120
Leave them alone.

32
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:43,000
- Great!
- Great!

33
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,840
What's this?

34
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:45,081
- Great!
- Great!

35
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:46,000
Well...

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,600
Impressive!

37
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,761
It's called Plucking Spring.

38
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
Plucking Spring?

39
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:52,720
The Water God Festival

40
00:02:52,761 --> 00:02:54,641
is a festival for lovers.

41
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:56,680
Besides worshiping the Water God,

42
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,680
we prepare programs

43
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,641
for couples.

44
00:02:58,921 --> 00:02:59,761
The Plucking Spring

45
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,120
is one of the traditions.

46
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:02,361
Look, on that tall bridge

47
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,280
hangs a wooden ball

48
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:04,680
containing the first cluster

49
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,521
of winter jasmine

50
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:07,160
that bloomed in spring.

51
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,840
Whoever retrieves it

52
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:09,720
the fastest

53
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,961
wins the Plucking Spring.

54
00:03:12,921 --> 00:03:13,600
I see.

55
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,440
Good.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,241
The winner

57
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,921
gets a grand prize.

58
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,241
What kind of prizes

59
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:26,201
are there?

60
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,992
All sorts of treasures

61
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:30,144
you can imagine.

62
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,120
Looks like you are

63
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,880
interested.

64
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,160
Let's check it out.

65
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:39,720
Okay.

66
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:45,241
- Great!
- Great!

67
00:03:46,081 --> 00:03:46,600
Good.

68
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,896
- Great!
- Great!

69
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,680
That's Mr. Qiao.

70
00:03:57,801 --> 00:03:58,880
What kind of whip

71
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
is this?

72
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,241
You've got a good eye!

73
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,160
This is Ziyu Whip, the biggest prize

74
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:04,761
for the Plucking Spring.

75
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,120
Seems you

76
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,560
really like this whip.

77
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:11,521
It's quite a unique whip.

78
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:13,881
Since you like it,

79
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,400
I'll get it for you.

80
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,201
Let her husband

81
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:23,280
win it for his wife instead.

82
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,881
Honey.

83
00:04:27,961 --> 00:04:29,201
Don't even think about it.

84
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:31,280
I'm already thinking.

85
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:35,600
If I don't have to pretend

86
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:38,112
to be elegant and delicate,

87
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,201
I'd compete to get it myself.

88
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,961
You really want that?

89
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:45,088
Hmm.

90
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,521
Fine weapons are rare.

91
00:04:47,761 --> 00:04:48,681
Missing this chance

92
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,840
would be a pity.

93
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,081
I'll compete.

94
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:58,201
Are you sure?

95
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,800
Yes.

96
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:01,681
Anyway I can't

97
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,280
let my wife down.

98
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,561
- Great!
- Great!

99
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,681
Honey.

100
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,160
Be careful.

101
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,480
Don't worry, Honey.

102
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:33,881
- Awesome!
- Awesome!

103
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,081
Look out!

104
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:36,480
Amazing!

105
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,160
- Great!
- Great!

106
00:05:57,472 --> 00:06:02,368
(Enjoy the beauty and harmony of spring)

107
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,001
That's my nephew.

108
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:25,961
This is the Ziyu Whip.

109
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,400
Here you go.

110
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,160
Thank you.

111
00:06:32,561 --> 00:06:33,216
My pleasure.

112
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:34,400
As long as you're happy.

113
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:37,081
I'm genuinely happy.

114
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:09,201
How come

115
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
Mr. Cui and the ladies

116
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,081
disappeared?

117
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:12,641
Probably they wanted us

118
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,001
to have privacy.

119
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,441
It's quite weird

120
00:07:16,441 --> 00:07:17,840
to hear you

121
00:07:17,881 --> 00:07:19,081
say something like that

122
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:20,960
in a cold tone.

123
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,081
Let's go.

124
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,448
Make one for her.

125
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:02,521
No need.

126
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,808
Make one.

127
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:04,800
Alright.

128
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
If we buy this,

129
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,761
we can't take it when we leave.

130
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:17,040
Why waste money?

131
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,201
Don't you like it?

132
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,081
If you do, then get one.

133
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:21,961
If you don't pursue something

134
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:22,840
you fear to lose,

135
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,521
that'd be rather dull.

136
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:28,480
Today,

137
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:29,760
you can

138
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,041
do everything you wish to do

139
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:32,760
without worries.

140
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,801
Just be your true self

141
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:37,401
as you've always been.

142
00:08:38,161 --> 00:08:39,081
Whatever you like

143
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,600
and dislike,

144
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
just say it outright.

145
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,041
Don't hold it back.

146
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,000
Can I truly

147
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,120
do whatever I want?

148
00:08:53,321 --> 00:08:54,201
Do as you please.

149
00:08:57,281 --> 00:08:57,824
Alright.

150
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,201
Do as I please.

151
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,681
Miss, your dough figurine is ready.

152
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:06,480
Thank you.

153
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:07,480
My pleasure.

154
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,041
Have a look.

155
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:23,284
Does it look like me?

156
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,520
It's better than you.

157
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:28,480
Turns out I do

158
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,432
look like a woman.

159
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:31,561
You are a woman.

160
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:45,880
We followed the faintest clues

161
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,321
to trace Chai Anxi.

162
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,120
But when I reached his hideout,

163
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:50,081
I was still late.

164
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:52,681
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:53,760
Please punish me.

166
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:55,640
Keep looking.

167
00:09:56,441 --> 00:09:57,056
Yes.

168
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,480
Perhaps we should go back.

169
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
We're Qiao Huanqing

170
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,600
and Wen Yuyan.

171
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:08,240
We must keep acting.

172
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:24,720
Is Chai Anxi a cockroach?

173
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,041
He's so good at hiding.

174
00:10:26,441 --> 00:10:26,961
No worries.

175
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:28,321
He can't escape Jiyang.

176
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,000
I will search everywhere

177
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,041
for him.

178
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:32,544
Look!

179
00:10:32,681 --> 00:10:33,201
A snake.

180
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,120
Throw it back!

181
00:10:34,281 --> 00:10:35,041
I hate snakes!

182
00:10:35,321 --> 00:10:35,880
Throw it away!

183
00:10:35,961 --> 00:10:36,520
Come on.

184
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:38,161
Coward.

185
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:39,201
Taotao.

186
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,120
No more pranks.

187
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:42,161
You're so gullible.

188
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,401
You wear it all day.

189
00:11:00,081 --> 00:11:00,720
Huanqing.

190
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,561
Yuyan.

191
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:03,961
Uncle.

192
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,640
What a coincidence!

193
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,961
Huanqing and Yuyan

194
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:11,801
stumbled onto Lovers' Bridge.

195
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,161
As a couple,

196
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:13,921
you should

197
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,000
cross this bridge.

198
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:16,520
During the Festival,

199
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,681
lovers crossing this bridge

200
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:21,041
will stay together forever.

201
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,424
Did you hear that?

202
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,161
Stay together forever.

203
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,561
What a dreadful curse.

204
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:29,760
True.

205
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,936
Look!

206
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,720
This is the Lovers' Bridge.

207
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:36,992
Only genuine lovers

208
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,281
can cross it together.

209
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,600
They can't match me.

210
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:48,760
I've crossed it four times.

211
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:56,480
You're quite romantic.

212
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,240
If I were him,

213
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:03,000
I'd cross just once in my life,

214
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:04,600
with one person only.

215
00:12:12,561 --> 00:12:14,081
What a rare opportunity!

216
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,880
Huanqing.

217
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,520
Yuyan.

218
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,840
Go give it a try!

219
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,401
Exactly.

220
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,281
Go ahead.

221
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,681
Give it a try.

222
00:12:22,401 --> 00:12:23,441
Crossing the bridge

223
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:25,321
is about the courage and love

224
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,880
to move forward together.

225
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:27,961
Love

226
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,281
brings you courage.

227
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,161
Courage born from love

228
00:12:31,321 --> 00:12:32,480
makes you invincible.

229
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:33,161
Moreover,

230
00:12:33,321 --> 00:12:34,441
the princess favors

231
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:36,041
lovers with unbreakable bonds.

232
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:37,880
If you two cross this bridge,

233
00:12:38,161 --> 00:12:39,081
it'll make it easier

234
00:12:39,201 --> 00:12:40,360
for you

235
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,921
to visit the princess.

236
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:42,688
Okay.

237
00:12:47,161 --> 00:12:47,872
What?

238
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,921
Nothing.

239
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,441
You make great sacrifices

240
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,041
to meet Princess Mengji.

241
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:04,720
Be careful.

242
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:06,240
Hold onto me.

243
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,161
This bridge looks unstable.

244
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,000
Crossing it together

245
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:14,401
might compromise your reputation, no?

246
00:13:16,801 --> 00:13:18,081
If you can't handle it,

247
00:13:18,656 --> 00:13:19,201
then...

248
00:13:19,201 --> 00:13:19,872
Never mind.

249
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:21,640
To meet the princess earlier,

250
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,120
let's get it over with

251
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:25,041
quickly now.

252
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:27,000
Made it

253
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,720
sound like we're going to die.

254
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:31,281
You made it sound

255
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,161
like I'm going

256
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:33,520
to live and die with you.

257
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,000
We can live together,

258
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,640
not die together.

259
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:17,401
Commander.

260
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,041
Should we use Qinggong?

261
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:22,081
Or we pretend we're stuck,

262
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:22,760
falling down?

263
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,000
Someone will help us.

264
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,120
Grab my collar.

265
00:14:28,321 --> 00:14:28,880
Quickly.

266
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,161
Hold tight.

267
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,640
It's so shaky.

268
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:45,321
Will they fall?

269
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,401
No.

270
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,096
They're not like us.

271
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:50,441
What do you mean?

272
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,720
Are you implying

273
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,401
we'd fall?

274
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:53,760
They know martial arts.

275
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,720
But we don't.

276
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,360
Let's watch.

277
00:14:58,561 --> 00:14:59,520
How about making a bet?

278
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:02,281
Let's cross that bridge too.

279
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:03,801
I bet we won't fall.

280
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,480
Should I then bet

281
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,161
that we'll fall?

282
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:06,961
That's madness!

283
00:15:07,961 --> 00:15:09,081
Are you going or not?

284
00:15:10,961 --> 00:15:11,520
Sure.

285
00:15:11,936 --> 00:15:12,520
Go.

286
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:36,320
Sorry.

287
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,041
(This is worse than daily drills)

288
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:44,081
(at the training field.)

289
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,081
Almost there.

290
00:16:21,734 --> 00:16:28,164
♪Before fate is confirmed♪

291
00:16:28,576 --> 00:16:34,528
♪My love rests between your fingers♪

292
00:16:35,232 --> 00:16:39,388
♪Farewell tears blurred my sight♪

293
00:16:39,388 --> 00:16:42,128
♪Indescribable yearnings♪

294
00:16:43,488 --> 00:16:45,760
♪Awaiting the spread of moonlight♪

295
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,840
Sir, keep moving!

296
00:16:57,801 --> 00:16:58,400
Go.

297
00:16:59,712 --> 00:17:00,457
Oh.

298
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,361
Well done,

299
00:17:19,441 --> 00:17:20,681
my nephew indeed, Huanqing.

300
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:21,856
Did it on the first try.

301
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,760
I feared

302
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:24,000
that if you failed,

303
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,320
you might never try again.

304
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,841
Surprisingly,

305
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,720
you easily crossed the Lovers' Bridge.

306
00:17:30,121 --> 00:17:30,961
That's good.

307
00:17:31,441 --> 00:17:33,361
Since you crossed the Lovers' Bridge,

308
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:34,601
in this life,

309
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,201
the two of you

310
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,800
will never part.

311
00:17:39,361 --> 00:17:40,040
Indeed.

312
00:17:40,441 --> 00:17:41,401
They will never part.

313
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,456
Where are

314
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,441
Mr. Cheng and Miss Song?

315
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,201
They are

316
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,080
crossing the Lovers' Bridge now.

317
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,520
Careful!

318
00:17:59,601 --> 00:18:00,441
As one

319
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:02,320
of the Capital's Four Young Masters,

320
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:03,720
I'm reduced to doing this.

321
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,080
It's utterly undignified.

322
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,201
Maybe we should quit.

323
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,320
Cheng Lisu!

324
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:09,520
If you retreat now,

325
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,121
I'll beat you up.

326
00:18:23,681 --> 00:18:24,760
Infuriating!

327
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,760
Crossing the bridge or not?

328
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,000
Let's do it!

329
00:18:34,641 --> 00:18:35,601
What a surprise!

330
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,800
They bicker all the time.

331
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:38,961
They are actually a couple.

332
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,881
Exactly.

333
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:41,961
Right,

334
00:18:42,441 --> 00:18:43,280
back then,

335
00:18:43,641 --> 00:18:44,961
I used to tug the braids

336
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,441
of the girl next door.

337
00:18:46,881 --> 00:18:47,720
That feeling...

338
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,401
Great!

339
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:00,080
We're already halfway done.

340
00:19:01,361 --> 00:19:02,601
Victory is within reach.

341
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:03,808
We absolutely cannot give up.

342
00:19:03,872 --> 00:19:04,441
Hmm.

343
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,601
- Good!
- Good!

344
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:12,133
- Good!
- One more!

345
00:19:12,288 --> 00:19:13,601
Look at that one up ahead.

346
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,648
- It's beautiful.
- More!

347
00:19:15,872 --> 00:19:17,448
- Great!
- Great!

348
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:26,841
- Great!
- Great!

349
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,000
- Great!
- Great!

350
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,280
Another one!

351
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,161
Mr. Cui.

352
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,841
What a coincidence!

353
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:40,641
Mr. Cui.

354
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,681
Miss Yan, Miss Ling.

355
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,441
Why haven't I seen

356
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,441
your parents around?

357
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,401
Our parents are on the boat.

358
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:47,480
Min'er and I

359
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,441
came out with servants

360
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,401
for a stroll.

361
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
We'll see the ceremony

362
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,320
and bring back some offerings.

363
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,841
- Great!
- Great!

364
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:00,760
Why are they

365
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,800
wearing masks?

366
00:20:01,841 --> 00:20:02,720
Each mask

367
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,121
represents an identity.

368
00:20:04,601 --> 00:20:05,841
These are related to legends

369
00:20:05,841 --> 00:20:07,121
about the Water God.

370
00:20:07,401 --> 00:20:08,240
During the ceremony,

371
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,000
everyone sings and dances together

372
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,681
to spread the legends

373
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:13,040
about the Water God.

374
00:20:13,601 --> 00:20:14,841
It's fascinating.

375
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:17,024
If you're interested,

376
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,720
you can dance with them

377
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,480
and play a character.

378
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:21,961
After it concludes,

379
00:20:22,361 --> 00:20:24,921
an elder will dip willow branches
in blessed water

380
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,000
and sprinkle the water on everyone.

381
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,800
The blessed water

382
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,601
will bring you good fortune.

383
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,841
Why let her join?

384
00:20:34,961 --> 00:20:37,121
Min'er and I also
want to dance on stage.

385
00:20:37,376 --> 00:20:38,161
If Mrs. Qiao

386
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,681
joins us,

387
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,961
it'll be better.

388
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:43,872
Alright!

389
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,401
But I don't usually dance.

390
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:46,841
You won't laugh at me, right?

391
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,601
Of course not.

392
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,921
We'll teach you.

393
00:20:51,456 --> 00:20:52,320
What's this?

394
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,921
If she doesn't participate,

395
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,881
how can we make a fool of her?

396
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,961
We'll go get masks then.

397
00:21:02,601 --> 00:21:03,280
Go ahead.

398
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,320
Good.

399
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:10,560
You know they have ill intentions.

400
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:12,040
Why not refuse?

401
00:21:13,952 --> 00:21:15,361
I'll play it by ear.

402
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,361
Besides,

403
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:18,280
even if I decline, they will try again.

404
00:21:18,681 --> 00:21:19,881
I want to see what tricks

405
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:20,841
they're going to play.

406
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,201
You really never stop thinking of

407
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,240
becoming a general.

408
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,000
Absolutely.

409
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,040
Come on.

410
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,520
They're waving at me now.

411
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:36,961
I'll go over.

412
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:37,585
Hmm.

413
00:21:39,072 --> 00:21:40,361
How interesting!

414
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:43,641
- Great!
- Great!

415
00:21:43,681 --> 00:21:44,441
Look!

416
00:21:44,681 --> 00:21:45,240
Mr. Cui.

417
00:21:51,681 --> 00:21:52,480
Is something wrong?

418
00:21:53,841 --> 00:21:54,441
A minor issue.

419
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:55,720
Enjoy yourselves

420
00:21:56,161 --> 00:21:57,080
and have fun.

421
00:21:59,961 --> 00:22:03,361
- Great!
- Great!

422
00:22:03,601 --> 00:22:06,080
(Looks like something big happened.)

423
00:22:33,681 --> 00:22:34,560
Mrs. Qiao.

424
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,560
There are many people

425
00:22:36,681 --> 00:22:37,881
at today's ritual ceremony.

426
00:22:38,161 --> 00:22:39,320
The ceremony master mentioned

427
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,401
that these masks

428
00:22:40,441 --> 00:22:41,800
must be assigned by lottery.

429
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,560
Why don't you draw a lot too?

430
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,441
What's different about these masks?

431
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,480
Different masks

432
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,080
represent different roles.

433
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:51,480
In the myths

434
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,921
of the Water God,

435
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:55,080
there are villains and buffoons.

436
00:22:55,601 --> 00:22:56,401
Who knows

437
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,320
which unlucky soul will draw them?

438
00:22:59,121 --> 00:23:00,560
I believe you won't

439
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,401
draw any of them.

440
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,601
Alright!

441
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:13,760
(Liar Fox)

442
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,760
Liar Fox.

443
00:23:18,336 --> 00:23:19,520
It's actually Liar Fox?

444
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,520
How unfortunate!

445
00:23:21,921 --> 00:23:23,161
What's wrong with this role?

446
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,560
He's a vicious liar

447
00:23:26,881 --> 00:23:28,841
who did evils near water sources.

448
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,040
He swindled people's fortunes,

449
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,480
even targeting elders and children.

450
00:23:34,201 --> 00:23:36,000
The most shameless things

451
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,161
were all done by him.

452
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,320
The deities could

453
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:40,441
no longer tolerate this.

454
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,280
They sent a man of the Water God,

455
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:44,080
an immortal, to subdue him.

456
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:45,480
Then?

457
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,641
The deceiver

458
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,601
could tell countless lies to others,

459
00:23:51,161 --> 00:23:52,800
but under the immortal's magic,

460
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,921
he could only speak truths.

461
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,000
He confessed ten secrets

462
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,961
about himself.

463
00:23:58,361 --> 00:24:00,560
Finally, he was imprisoned
in an underwater dungeon,

464
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,520
never to set foot on land again.

465
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:04,740
Oh.

466
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,881
How tragic!

467
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,361
It is tragic indeed.

468
00:24:08,841 --> 00:24:09,560
However,

469
00:24:09,601 --> 00:24:11,441
since you've drawn that role,

470
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:13,000
you must play Liar Fox.

471
00:24:13,841 --> 00:24:16,361
If you accept to join the ritual

472
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,000
but later withdraw,

473
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,441
you'll be punished

474
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,881
by the Water God.

475
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:27,040
Fine.

476
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,841
I can be a buffoon.

477
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,000
Someone

478
00:24:30,121 --> 00:24:31,401
has to play it, right?

479
00:24:40,681 --> 00:24:41,800
As you said,

480
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,121
Liar Fox must tell secrets

481
00:24:43,401 --> 00:24:44,601
to the immortal, right?

482
00:24:45,121 --> 00:24:45,881
Correct.

483
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,601
The secrets

484
00:24:47,641 --> 00:24:49,240
must be genuine.

485
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,760
So, Mrs. Qiao,

486
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,681
you have to reveal ten secrets of yours.

487
00:24:53,881 --> 00:24:54,760
The so-called immortal

488
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:55,681
is just a madman

489
00:24:55,681 --> 00:24:57,280
who snoops into others' secrets.

490
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,601
That's the immortal's mask.

491
00:25:08,401 --> 00:25:09,560
Let me play the immortal.

492
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:11,161
Why?

493
00:25:12,841 --> 00:25:13,881
We already have someone

494
00:25:13,921 --> 00:25:14,881
play that role.

495
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,601
My wife's secrets

496
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,800
shouldn't be heard by others.

497
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,681
Put it on.

498
00:25:43,641 --> 00:25:44,240
Let me help.

499
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,040
Haven't you worn masks before?

500
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,361
It's not that hard.

501
00:26:08,161 --> 00:26:09,121
You've worn many?

502
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,320
Perhaps I wear masks in my dreams.

503
00:26:50,961 --> 00:26:52,224
How should we dance?

504
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,121
I have no idea.

505
00:26:55,361 --> 00:26:57,121
Miss Ling mentioned

506
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,592
that Liar Fox must tell the immortal

507
00:26:58,592 --> 00:26:59,520
ten secrets.

508
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Now that we're here,

509
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,080
let me tell you

510
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,080
my ten secrets.

511
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,121
Go ahead.

512
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,312
I'm listening.

513
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,280
I will

514
00:27:07,441 --> 00:27:08,121
start dancing.

515
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,240
I used to handle alcohol well,

516
00:27:14,441 --> 00:27:15,280
but now I can't.

517
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,681
I've memorized Wuzi's Art of War.

518
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,568
I'm the number one in Yezhou Garrison.

519
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,921
My favorite dish

520
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,720
is mushroom and chicken stew.

521
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:29,681
I gave Lisu's jade pendant

522
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:31,401
to the courtesans

523
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,121
of Wanhua Pavilion.

524
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:35,280
How impressive!

525
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:38,681
In my eyes,

526
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,520
Commander is a good man.

527
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,121
I'm deeply grateful to him.

528
00:27:43,641 --> 00:27:44,601
What a smooth talker.

529
00:27:45,841 --> 00:27:47,720
Every time Commander misunderstands me,

530
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,921
it breaks my heart.

531
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:51,961
Go on.

532
00:27:54,921 --> 00:27:55,800
Commander and I met

533
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,201
in a former life.

534
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:02,601
I was once a general.

535
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:04,040
I thought

536
00:28:04,401 --> 00:28:05,480
you'd say "I will be."

537
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,641
The last secret.

538
00:28:11,881 --> 00:28:13,121
I love the moon.

539
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,560
Yet the moon doesn't know.

540
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:17,536
That's all.

541
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:28,635
♪Crimson threads entwine like rings,
binding our first vow♪

542
00:28:28,635 --> 00:28:33,076
♪Time lingers as you and I share
overlapping palm lines♪

543
00:28:33,076 --> 00:28:37,103
♪Zither and harp
accompany our dancing dreams♪

544
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,552
♪The brocade moon writes our vow,
keeping this promise♪

545
00:29:13,361 --> 00:29:14,720
Jiyang has many famous views.

546
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,480
But only the fireflies

547
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,760
at the Firefly Spring

548
00:29:18,441 --> 00:29:19,441
are truly renowned.

549
00:29:19,961 --> 00:29:20,881
It really is beautiful.

550
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:35,161
Commander.

551
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Why are you being so kind

552
00:29:37,121 --> 00:29:38,161
to me today?

553
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,480
Isn't today your birthday?

554
00:29:43,921 --> 00:29:44,841
How did you know?

555
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,280
You are

556
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:48,601
not a good liar.

557
00:29:49,161 --> 00:29:49,881
Sometimes,

558
00:29:50,401 --> 00:29:51,520
your lies are flawed.

559
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,560
Sometimes,

560
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:56,121
you speak truths or tell lies.

561
00:29:56,441 --> 00:29:57,441
It's hard to tell.

562
00:29:58,161 --> 00:29:58,841
Frankly,

563
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:01,121
we're the same sort.

564
00:30:10,121 --> 00:30:10,848
On your birthday,

565
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,441
don't you make a wish?

566
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,681
Go ahead.

567
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,401
Finish your birthday.

568
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:22,601
I have no wishes.

569
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,280
Making a wish

570
00:30:26,841 --> 00:30:28,441
is just self-deception.

571
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:30,201
Whatever I desire,

572
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,040
I'll get it myself.

573
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,520
That's it?

574
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,441
I thought you would

575
00:30:42,361 --> 00:30:43,601
wish for promotions and honors

576
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,601
or military achievements.

577
00:30:51,361 --> 00:30:51,921
Commander.

578
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,121
Haven't you noticed

579
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:56,361
that since we met,

580
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,800
I've always pretended
to be someone else?

581
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,320
For example, Cheng Lisu

582
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,201
and Wen Yuyan.

583
00:31:05,641 --> 00:31:06,401
Who knows
