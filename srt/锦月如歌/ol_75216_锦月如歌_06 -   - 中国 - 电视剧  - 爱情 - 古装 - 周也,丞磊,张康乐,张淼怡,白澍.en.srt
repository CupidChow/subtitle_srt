Wait, Mr. Shen.

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,823
But He took first place.

26
00:01:48,064 --> 00:01:49,543
- He...
- First place, so what?

27
00:01:51,504 --> 00:01:52,383
Get back to it.

28
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:53,424
Don't make a scene.

29
00:01:55,224 --> 00:01:56,296
Listen up, all of you.

30
00:01:56,296 --> 00:01:57,983
Commander selects the candidate

31
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,103
based on a comprehensive evaluation.

32
00:02:01,144 --> 00:02:03,543
The competition was just one aspect.

33
00:02:18,704 --> 00:02:19,903
They've got poor judgment.

34
00:02:20,184 --> 00:02:21,024
Right.

35
00:02:21,024 --> 00:02:21,864
Come on.

36
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:23,183
Let's drink.

37
00:02:23,183 --> 00:02:24,023
Let's drink.

38
00:02:24,584 --> 00:02:26,183
So eager to join the battalion?

39
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,384
Only then

40
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:33,384
can I earn merits in combats.

41
00:02:33,824 --> 00:02:35,463
Only then can I become a general.

42
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:39,304
In such a hurry for glorious homecoming?

43
00:02:47,063 --> 00:02:48,144
I have no family.

44
00:02:51,663 --> 00:02:52,704
All I want

45
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:55,783
is to prove my worth.

46
00:02:57,424 --> 00:02:58,264
Lei Hou

47
00:02:58,903 --> 00:03:00,304
is your defeated opponent.

48
00:03:00,943 --> 00:03:02,504
Huaijin chose him over you.

49
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,223
That's his loss.

50
00:03:43,663 --> 00:03:44,663
Let's drink.

51
00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:47,063
Here.

52
00:03:49,743 --> 00:03:50,864
The Mid-Autumn Festival.

53
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,183
Family reunion day.

54
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:54,503
I'll drink my fill.

55
00:03:59,063 --> 00:03:59,903
Cheers.

56
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:03,583
- Being happy, I won't get drunk.
- Eat a lot.

57
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:20,383
Xiao Jue.

58
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:21,543
You've gone too far!

59
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:23,503
What did you call me?

60
00:04:28,423 --> 00:04:29,463
Xiao Jue.

61
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:34,663
Are you stupid?

62
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,543
You don't even know your name.

63
00:04:43,504 --> 00:04:44,344
Xiao Jue.

64
00:04:44,543 --> 00:04:45,903
Do you know who I am?

65
00:04:49,184 --> 00:04:50,024
Who are you?

66
00:04:58,184 --> 00:04:59,024
I

67
00:04:59,663 --> 00:05:00,904
have been walking around

68
00:05:00,904 --> 00:05:01,904
with only one name.

69
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,184
That is

70
00:05:03,184 --> 00:05:04,024
He Yan.

71
00:05:04,024 --> 00:05:05,104
The top one

72
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:07,263
of Yezhou Garrison.

73
00:05:20,663 --> 00:05:21,903
How much did you drink?

74
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:25,736
Go sober up.

75
00:05:32,024 --> 00:05:32,864
Sober up.

76
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:36,744
Go sober up.

77
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:47,383
Wait.

78
00:05:48,504 --> 00:05:49,663
Why should I leave?

79
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,144
You haven't told me

80
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,103
why you didn't
let me join the battalion.

81
00:05:56,504 --> 00:05:57,344
I am

82
00:05:57,344 --> 00:05:58,944
the top one of Yezhou Garrison,

83
00:06:01,704 --> 00:06:03,863
an outstanding candidate.

84
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:05,943
You

85
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:08,103
have terrible judgment!

86
00:06:15,103 --> 00:06:17,903
I actually know
why you didn't select me.

87
00:06:18,384 --> 00:06:19,863
You suspect

88
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,744
there's a spy.

89
00:06:26,424 --> 00:06:29,663
But you kept testing me repeatedly.

90
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:31,783
You clearly know I'm not.

91
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,344
Lei Hou.

92
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:43,504
It's Lei Hou.

93
00:06:49,264 --> 00:06:50,104
See?

94
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:51,624
Am I clever?

95
00:06:54,144 --> 00:06:55,384
You are clever indeed.

96
00:06:56,223 --> 00:06:57,103
But clever people

97
00:06:57,983 --> 00:06:59,423
often meet bad ends.

98
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:01,463
What bad end?

99
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:03,584
Let me tell you.

100
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:05,703
I, He Yan,

101
00:07:05,944 --> 00:07:06,903
will one day

102
00:07:07,663 --> 00:07:09,504
become a celebrated general.

103
00:07:39,463 --> 00:07:40,303
He Yan.

104
00:07:56,103 --> 00:07:56,943
Put it back.

105
00:07:58,863 --> 00:07:59,783
He Yan, put it back.

106
00:08:00,223 --> 00:08:01,063
Commander.

107
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:03,463
Don't be angry.

108
00:08:03,703 --> 00:08:06,463
I'll perform a sword dance for you.

109
00:09:04,663 --> 00:09:05,503
Know you're wrong?

110
00:09:13,464 --> 00:09:14,304
No need to kneel.

111
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:24,504
Xiao Jue,

112
00:09:26,504 --> 00:09:28,104
do you like me?

113
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:34,543
Feinu,

114
00:09:34,943 --> 00:09:35,783
this is...?

115
00:09:36,624 --> 00:09:38,903
I will bring dinner for the Commander.
What about you?

116
00:09:38,943 --> 00:09:40,984
The banquet is not over. Why come here?

117
00:09:41,423 --> 00:09:43,303
I've been selected for the battalion.

118
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:45,183
I wanted to thank the Commander.

119
00:09:45,744 --> 00:09:47,224
But I never expected he...

120
00:09:55,104 --> 00:09:57,063
You must dislike me.

121
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:58,503
Otherwise,

122
00:09:58,744 --> 00:10:01,864
why wouldn't you
let me join the battalion?

123
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:05,743
Let go.

124
00:10:07,176 --> 00:10:08,184
This is outrageous.

125
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:09,344
You have poor judgment.

126
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:10,744
I'm so disappointed in you.

127
00:10:11,504 --> 00:10:12,344
Tell me.

128
00:10:13,304 --> 00:10:14,984
In terms of looks,

129
00:10:15,344 --> 00:10:16,184
martial skills,

130
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:18,704
or height,

131
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:19,663
where am I lacking?

132
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:23,464
Tell me, where am I lacking?

133
00:10:25,464 --> 00:10:26,304
Height?

134
00:10:28,943 --> 00:10:30,264
Even considering

135
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,903
our bond,

136
00:10:33,504 --> 00:10:34,703
shouldn't you at least

137
00:10:35,264 --> 00:10:36,663
add one more slot?

138
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:39,624
What bond?

139
00:10:41,264 --> 00:10:42,744
You're reneging on your promise.

140
00:10:43,663 --> 00:10:45,543
I...

141
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,063
I'll prove it to you.

142
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:48,704
I...

143
00:10:50,464 --> 00:10:51,304
Here we go again.

144
00:11:00,104 --> 00:11:00,944
Let go of me.

145
00:11:23,744 --> 00:11:24,663
Xiao Jue.

146
00:11:26,543 --> 00:11:29,264
If you don't give me that extra slot,

147
00:11:30,183 --> 00:11:31,183
I'll...

148
00:11:32,464 --> 00:11:33,624
I'll...

149
00:11:35,063 --> 00:11:35,984
What will you do?

150
00:11:37,903 --> 00:11:39,104
I'll...

151
00:11:41,543 --> 00:11:42,864
I'll...

152
00:11:56,823 --> 00:11:57,864
Comfortable sleep?

153
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:01,344
Very cozy.

154
00:12:11,303 --> 00:12:12,143
Mr. He,

155
00:12:12,384 --> 00:12:15,264
you slept soundly in Huaijin's tent.

156
00:12:15,823 --> 00:12:17,144
Truly extraordinary.

157
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:24,383
The Commander's tent?

158
00:12:24,864 --> 00:12:25,704
Yes.

159
00:12:28,744 --> 00:12:30,384
To make space for you,

160
00:12:30,472 --> 00:12:31,744
last night,

161
00:12:31,744 --> 00:12:33,543
Huaijin squeezed into my place.

162
00:12:34,104 --> 00:12:35,864
Well? Did you remember anything?

163
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,304
Seems like you did.

164
00:13:16,103 --> 00:13:17,823
Did he mention how to punish me?

165
00:13:18,543 --> 00:13:19,383
No.

166
00:13:21,063 --> 00:13:22,744
But he looked furious.

167
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:25,344
Oh no.

168
00:13:27,744 --> 00:13:29,103
Oh no, oh no.

169
00:13:29,103 --> 00:13:29,943
Forget the battalion.

170
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,144
I might not stay here anymore.

171
00:13:31,864 --> 00:13:33,104
What to do? What to do?

172
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:34,143
Not necessarily.

173
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:36,304
Consider this.

174
00:13:36,543 --> 00:13:38,504
You used his treasured sword

175
00:13:38,504 --> 00:13:40,136
to smash his beloved zither,

176
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:41,183
but he didn't kill you

177
00:13:41,264 --> 00:13:42,504
and even made space for you.

178
00:13:43,384 --> 00:13:44,224
Think about it.

179
00:13:44,744 --> 00:13:46,216
Why did he treat you so kindly?

180
00:13:47,423 --> 00:13:48,663
He must've noticed

181
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:50,864
your unique physique.

182
00:13:55,624 --> 00:13:56,543
Unique...

183
00:13:59,063 --> 00:14:00,624
Unique physique?

184
00:14:05,384 --> 00:14:06,224
(Could it be)

185
00:14:06,504 --> 00:14:08,104
(he discovered I'm a woman?)

186
00:14:08,943 --> 00:14:11,104
You're a rare prodigy.

187
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:12,703
That's why he tolerates you.

188
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:16,864
Am I wrong?

189
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:41,023
Xiao Jue.

190
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:43,080
Do you know who I am?

191
00:14:44,423 --> 00:14:46,783
I'm the top one of Yezhou Garrison,

192
00:14:49,183 --> 00:14:50,783
an outstanding candidate.

193
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:52,584
You

194
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:54,144
have terrible judgment!

195
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:55,943
Commander,

196
00:14:55,943 --> 00:14:57,423
please don't be angry.

197
00:14:57,664 --> 00:15:00,303
I'll perform a sword dance for you.

198
00:15:05,063 --> 00:15:06,344
My misbehavior demands

199
00:15:07,063 --> 00:15:09,024
a proper apology to the Commander.

200
00:15:40,903 --> 00:15:41,783
Light on his feet,

201
00:15:42,624 --> 00:15:43,543
with steady breath.

202
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:44,624
A skilled fighter.

203
00:15:47,624 --> 00:15:51,336
(Invitation)

204
00:15:56,344 --> 00:15:57,184
Summon Cheng Lisu.

205
00:15:58,104 --> 00:15:58,944
Yes.

206
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,423
Commander,

207
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:09,024
drunken words
shouldn't be taken seriously.

208
00:16:09,744 --> 00:16:10,584
Well,

209
00:16:10,864 --> 00:16:11,704
strike me ten times

210
00:16:12,183 --> 00:16:13,303
and let this matter rest.

211
00:16:17,783 --> 00:16:18,623
Commander,

212
00:16:18,864 --> 00:16:19,704
or perhaps

213
00:16:20,264 --> 00:16:21,864
I'll forfeit three years' pay

214
00:16:22,224 --> 00:16:23,583
to compensate for your zither.

215
00:16:24,464 --> 00:16:25,624
Please show mercy.

216
00:16:26,504 --> 00:16:27,344
Could you

217
00:16:28,144 --> 00:16:29,303
let me join the battalion?

218
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,663
He,

219
00:16:32,103 --> 00:16:34,303
what are you muttering about alone here?

220
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:36,423
Are you looking for extra training?

221
00:16:37,744 --> 00:16:38,864
Considering an apology.

222
00:16:39,344 --> 00:16:40,384
Considering an apology?

223
00:16:43,024 --> 00:16:43,984
Kneeling on this?

224
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,903
This place is truly vast.

225
00:16:48,543 --> 00:16:49,703
Thank you so much, young man.

226
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:51,744
If I walked alone,

227
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,703
I'd likely get lost.

228
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:55,304
(Miss He,)

229
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,024
(in your next life, avoid being
born into He family.)

230
00:17:05,744 --> 00:17:06,584
It's him.

231
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:14,304
He.

232
00:17:14,863 --> 00:17:16,103
Not picking a weapon?

233
00:17:29,704 --> 00:17:30,544
Sir,

234
00:17:31,023 --> 00:17:31,863
earlier,

235
00:17:31,863 --> 00:17:33,744
who was that person with you?

236
00:17:33,983 --> 00:17:35,663
The Yezhou Magistrate's man.

237
00:17:35,983 --> 00:17:37,736
He delivered an invitation
to our Commander.

238
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,143
Thank you.

239
00:17:40,424 --> 00:17:41,744
(Yezhou Magistrate's man?)

240
00:17:42,504 --> 00:17:43,344
(His severed finger)

241
00:17:43,623 --> 00:17:44,463
(and his voice.)

242
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:46,703
(It's the man
who hurt me at Yuhua Temple.)

243
00:17:47,464 --> 00:17:48,823
(The He family's henchman.)

244
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:51,664
(They infiltrated Yezhou Magistrate.)

245
00:17:52,224 --> 00:17:53,224
(What are they planning?)

246
00:17:55,184 --> 00:17:58,088
Yezhou Garrison faces shortages
in military funds and provisions.

247
00:17:58,184 --> 00:17:59,863
I feel deeply concerned.

248
00:18:00,184 --> 00:18:03,103
We sincerely invite
Commander Xiao Jue of Yezhou Garrison

249
00:18:03,264 --> 00:18:04,343
for discussion.

250
00:18:04,944 --> 00:18:07,823
I also hear your nephew Cheng Lisu
is currently at Yezhou Garrison.

251
00:18:08,343 --> 00:18:10,464
Having not seen him for years,

252
00:18:10,504 --> 00:18:11,583
I feel nostalgic.

253
00:18:12,063 --> 00:18:14,424
Hoping the Commander
will bring him along.

254
00:18:14,863 --> 00:18:17,063
(Invitation)
Yezhou Magistrate, Sun Xiangfu.

255
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,744
He's inviting you
for an official matter.

256
00:18:21,944 --> 00:18:22,784
Why include me?

257
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,783
I have no old bonds to reminisce about.

258
00:18:27,424 --> 00:18:28,264
You don't remember?

259
00:18:33,815 --> 00:18:35,752
(Yezhou Magistrate, Sun Xiangfu)

260
00:18:38,303 --> 00:18:39,264
Sun Xiangfu!

261
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:42,824
When he came to the capital years ago,

262
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:44,543
his wife arranged a marriage for you.

263
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,383
Oh, no.

264
00:18:46,383 --> 00:18:48,224
He'll probably lure me there first,

265
00:18:48,543 --> 00:18:49,424
then detain me,

266
00:18:49,743 --> 00:18:51,664
and send me back
to Yaojing for marriage!

267
00:18:52,224 --> 00:18:53,064
This...

268
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:55,024
Huaijin.

269
00:18:55,944 --> 00:18:56,784
Uncle.

270
00:18:56,904 --> 00:18:58,760
You have to save me.

271
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,224
You can't watch your best friend,

272
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:02,264
your adorable nephew,

273
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:03,383
jump into hellfire.

274
00:19:10,863 --> 00:19:11,984
Is it that terrible?

275
00:19:12,383 --> 00:19:13,303
Absolutely.

276
00:19:13,744 --> 00:19:14,823
You know full well

277
00:19:15,184 --> 00:19:17,143
Miss Song and I despise each other.

278
00:19:17,264 --> 00:19:18,583
She spends all day tinkering with

279
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:19,583
strange concoctions.

280
00:19:20,224 --> 00:19:21,543
I'll become her lab rat,

281
00:19:21,543 --> 00:19:23,184
slowly tortured to death.

282
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,544
I'd rather

283
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,504
end it all now!

284
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,463
Wait.

285
00:19:27,943 --> 00:19:28,783
Uncle,

286
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:30,343
I knew you wouldn't abandon me.

287
00:19:31,224 --> 00:19:32,224
Our bond is so strong.

288
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,184
W-What...?

289
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:39,944
What are you doing?

290
00:19:45,704 --> 00:19:47,063
Yinqiu is sharp.

291
00:19:48,383 --> 00:19:49,223
I'll lend it to you.

292
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,623
You're joking?

293
00:19:53,184 --> 00:19:54,024
Uncle,

294
00:19:54,623 --> 00:19:57,863
you wouldn't really
let me die, would you?

295
00:20:01,823 --> 00:20:03,264
Don't you want to end it all?

296
00:20:03,863 --> 00:20:04,703
I...

297
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:06,760
I was just kidding.

298
00:20:17,664 --> 00:20:18,504
Mr. Cheng,

299
00:20:19,383 --> 00:20:21,424
I heard someone sent
the Commander an invitation.

300
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:22,943
Mr. He,

301
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:24,184
I'm going to die.

302
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:25,463
When the time comes,

303
00:20:25,664 --> 00:20:27,143
burn lots of joss paper for me.

304
00:20:27,823 --> 00:20:29,303
Mr. Cheng, what's wrong?

305
00:20:29,904 --> 00:20:31,103
I'm going with Huaijin

306
00:20:31,144 --> 00:20:33,583
to visit the Yezhou Magistrate.

307
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:35,343
That's a dangerous place.

308
00:20:36,063 --> 00:20:36,944
Dangerous place?

309
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:38,583
With the Commander, why fear?

310
00:20:39,024 --> 00:20:41,184
Unless in the magistrate's mansion,

311
00:20:41,543 --> 00:20:42,464
there are people

312
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,783
stronger than the Commander?

313
00:20:44,383 --> 00:20:46,464
Sun Xiangfu is more terrifying.

314
00:20:47,063 --> 00:20:48,784
His wife was my marriage matchmaker.

315
00:20:49,184 --> 00:20:50,024
This time,

316
00:20:50,264 --> 00:20:51,863
not even Xiao Jue can protect me.

317
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:56,184
So the Commander is visiting Yezhou

318
00:20:56,184 --> 00:20:57,623
to discuss your marriage?

319
00:20:57,783 --> 00:20:58,623
No.

320
00:20:58,744 --> 00:21:00,303
He is going for an official matter.

321
00:21:00,464 --> 00:21:02,823
Only I must go through this.

322
00:21:03,543 --> 00:21:05,352
Official matter?

323
00:21:05,352 --> 00:21:06,344
What is that?

324
00:21:06,344 --> 00:21:09,103
The Yezhou Magistrate wants
the Commander's personal presence?

325
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,343
He's got some nerve.

326
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:11,943
No.

327
00:21:12,024 --> 00:21:13,704
Huaijin is going
for provisions and funds.

328
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:14,943
I'm just...

329
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,223
Hold on, Mr. He.

330
00:21:16,623 --> 00:21:18,024
Why do you keep mentioning Huaijin?

331
00:21:18,424 --> 00:21:20,504
I'm the one in hot water, not him.

332
00:21:22,504 --> 00:21:23,344
Mr. Cheng,

333
00:21:23,744 --> 00:21:25,664
I just thought he'd be capable enough.

334
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,303
If you can't rely on him,

335
00:21:28,184 --> 00:21:29,464
let me help brainstorm ideas.

336
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:31,663
Come on, let's go.

337
00:21:32,343 --> 00:21:33,424
Let me think.

338
00:21:34,464 --> 00:21:35,304
Commander,

339
00:21:35,823 --> 00:21:36,704
Sun Xiangfu has been

340
00:21:37,143 --> 00:21:39,024
dodging the funds and provisions issue,

341
00:21:39,303 --> 00:21:40,552
but at this critical moment,

342
00:21:40,552 --> 00:21:41,584
he suddenly invites you.

343
00:21:41,704 --> 00:21:42,744
It must be a trap.

344
00:21:42,824 --> 00:21:44,704
This is clearly an ambush banquet.

345
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:46,104
Should we decline?

346
00:21:47,024 --> 00:21:47,864
If I don't go,

347
00:21:48,303 --> 00:21:49,543
they won't give up.

348
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,664
A stab in the back is hard to dodge.

349
00:21:52,504 --> 00:21:53,623
We should strike first.

350
00:21:54,264 --> 00:21:55,104
Moreover,

351
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:58,184
doesn't Sun Xiangfu
still owe us for the provisions?

352
00:21:58,384 --> 00:21:59,224
Commander.

353
00:21:59,224 --> 00:22:00,343
I've just received news.

354
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,944
The Inspector
of the Ministry of War, Chu Zhao,

355
00:22:02,944 --> 00:22:03,863
is coming to Yezhou.

356
00:22:04,303 --> 00:22:05,664
I think you know this man.

357
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:08,623
Top scholar in 19th Year of Qingyuan,
Xu Jingfu's prized disciple.

358
00:22:09,303 --> 00:22:11,543
He's been serving
Xu Jingfu all these years.

359
00:22:12,424 --> 00:22:13,264
I find he just

360
00:22:13,744 --> 00:22:14,944
returned from Que City.

361
00:22:19,343 --> 00:22:20,183
Continue.

362
00:22:20,744 --> 00:22:21,584
The Que City battle

363
00:22:21,664 --> 00:22:22,504
hurt your reputation.

364
00:22:22,823 --> 00:22:24,184
It's unclear if he's involved.

365
00:22:24,464 --> 00:22:25,304
Now in Yezhou,

366
00:22:25,743 --> 00:22:27,504
his intentions here remain unknown.

367
00:22:28,184 --> 00:22:29,504
I've dealt with Chu Zhao before.

368
00:22:30,303 --> 00:22:32,504
He suffered mistreatment
in his family initially

369
00:22:32,863 --> 00:22:33,904
until he earned his title,

370
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:36,504
and then his family
changed their attitude.

371
00:22:37,144 --> 00:22:39,063
Now, he serves under Xu Jingfu.

372
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:42,184
Undoubtedly, he is using
Xu Jingfu's influence for advancement.

373
00:22:42,744 --> 00:22:44,103
Regardless of his true motives,

374
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,264
he ultimately works for Xu Jingfu.

375
00:22:48,143 --> 00:22:48,984
What a coincidence.

376
00:22:49,904 --> 00:22:51,024
Returning from Que City.

377
00:22:52,224 --> 00:22:54,184
Those rumors must stem from him.

378
00:22:54,704 --> 00:22:55,863
During this Yezhou mission,

379
00:22:56,744 --> 00:22:57,863
stay vigilant against him.

380
00:22:58,024 --> 00:22:58,864
Yes.

381
00:22:58,904 --> 00:22:59,744
Commander.

382
00:22:59,904 --> 00:23:01,103
This mission is dangerous.

383
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:02,704
Mr. Cheng can't fight.

384
00:23:03,103 --> 00:23:03,943
Taking him along

385
00:23:04,143 --> 00:23:05,383
could be problematic.

386
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,103
Cheng Lisu isn't going.

387
00:23:07,424 --> 00:23:08,383
He Yan will go.

388
00:23:15,704 --> 00:23:16,544
What's wrong?

389
00:23:17,343 --> 00:23:18,183
No problem.

390
00:23:18,704 --> 00:23:20,744
Commander, don't you doubt
He Yan's identity?

391
00:23:21,143 --> 00:23:22,744
Why bring him along then?

392
00:23:25,343 --> 00:23:27,504
Leaving him here worries me.

393
00:23:27,984 --> 00:23:29,343
Since he's so eager to go,

394
00:23:30,184 --> 00:23:31,024
let him join me.

395
00:23:31,823 --> 00:23:33,063
He boasts of his skills.

396
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:34,823
This banquet will test

397
00:23:35,704 --> 00:23:37,264
whether his claims hold true.

398
00:23:45,823 --> 00:23:47,184
(Sun Xiangfu has been withholding)

399
00:23:47,264 --> 00:23:48,783
(the military provisions and funds,)

400
00:23:49,783 --> 00:23:52,464
(but now suddenly invites
Xiao Jue to negotiate.)

401
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,143
(He Rufei and Sun Xiangfu)

402
00:23:55,823 --> 00:23:57,063
(must be plotting something.)

403
00:23:57,783 --> 00:23:58,623
(Their target)

404
00:23:58,944 --> 00:23:59,984
(is Yezhou Garrison,)

405
00:24:00,823 --> 00:24:02,063
(perhaps even Xiao Jue.)

406
00:24:04,464 --> 00:24:05,464
(This trip to Yezhou,)

407
00:24:06,143 --> 00:24:07,383
(whether for the garrison,)

408
00:24:07,664 --> 00:24:08,504
(Xiao Jue,)

409
00:24:08,783 --> 00:24:09,744
(or me,)

410
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:13,184
(I must uncover the truth.)

411
00:24:33,543 --> 00:24:34,383
Commander.

412
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,064
You seem distracted.

413
00:24:36,783 --> 00:24:37,623
What troubles you?

414
00:24:38,504 --> 00:24:39,344
Commander,

415
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:40,984
I drank too much last night.

416
00:24:41,143 --> 00:24:42,024
Sorry

417
00:24:42,543 --> 00:24:43,383
for offending you.

418
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:45,664
But must you stare at me like this?

419
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,184
I've already thought of
a way to redeem myself.

420
00:24:48,944 --> 00:24:50,943
So you take Cheng Lisu's place
and go to Yezhou

421
00:24:51,303 --> 00:24:52,224
just to atone?

422
00:24:53,704 --> 00:24:54,863
Not entirely.

423
00:24:55,303 --> 00:24:56,543
Aside from easing your burdens,

424
00:24:57,103 --> 00:24:58,103
it's for my own sake.

425
00:24:58,904 --> 00:24:59,744
For yourself?

426
00:25:02,303 --> 00:25:04,463
I want to join the battalion
to make achievements.

427
00:25:04,783 --> 00:25:05,744
If this trip

428
00:25:05,783 --> 00:25:07,504
can make you change your opinion of me,

429
00:25:07,823 --> 00:25:08,663
then next time,

430
00:25:08,863 --> 00:25:10,024
the slot for the battalion

431
00:25:10,224 --> 00:25:11,064
will be mine.

432
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,823
Such a golden opportunity.

433
00:25:12,984 --> 00:25:14,143
Of course I'll seize it.

434
00:25:19,863 --> 00:25:20,703
Good.

435
00:25:21,343 --> 00:25:22,424
Let's see

436
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,504
how you'll change my opinion.

437
00:25:50,624 --> 00:25:51,464
Commander.

438
00:25:51,464 --> 00:25:52,304
Mr. Cheng.

439
00:25:52,424 --> 00:25:53,264
Mr. Feinu.

440
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:54,423
Morning.

441
00:25:54,904 --> 00:25:55,744
Morning.

442
00:26:01,024 --> 00:26:02,224
I am Cheng Lisu

443
00:26:02,543 --> 00:26:03,664
from the capital.

444
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,823
I love mushroom and chicken stew,

445
00:26:05,904 --> 00:26:06,944
hate congee,

446
00:26:07,303 --> 00:26:09,224
avoid peanuts
and love cleanliness the most.

447
00:26:09,383 --> 00:26:11,303
I burn incense and bathe daily.

448
00:26:11,823 --> 00:26:12,663
Well done. Well done.

449
00:26:12,783 --> 00:26:13,863
You've memorized that well.

450
00:26:15,103 --> 00:26:17,143
As the saying goes,
clothes make the man.

451
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:20,383
This looks better.

452
00:26:24,743 --> 00:26:25,583
Mr. He,

453
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,823
your demeanor today

454
00:26:27,024 --> 00:26:27,944
almost rivals mine.

455
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:29,583
You flatter me.

456
00:26:31,103 --> 00:26:32,704
Commander, what do you think?

457
00:26:32,704 --> 00:26:33,744
Do I look

458
00:26:33,944 --> 00:26:36,744
charming and dashing?

459
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:38,304
You're even

460
00:26:40,383 --> 00:26:41,623
shorter than Cheng Lisu.

461
00:26:44,383 --> 00:26:45,223
Who says that?

462
00:26:45,664 --> 00:26:46,504
About my height.

463
00:26:47,303 --> 00:26:48,143
When are you leaving?

464
00:26:56,904 --> 00:26:57,744
Go away.

465
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:08,584
(Yezhou City)

466
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:14,423
Young Master.

467
00:27:14,664 --> 00:27:16,664
Ding Yi has made contact
with Sun Xiangfu.

468
00:27:17,224 --> 00:27:19,424
The invitation for Xiao Jue
to come to Yezhou City

469
00:27:19,783 --> 00:27:21,544
must now be in his hands.

470
00:27:21,863 --> 00:27:22,703
Good.

471
00:27:23,424 --> 00:27:24,264
Found anything

472
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:25,383
about the Sun family?

473
00:27:25,783 --> 00:27:26,944
As you instructed,

474
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,143
we targeted Sun Xiangfu's useless son.

475
00:27:29,823 --> 00:27:30,744
Fruitful results.

476
00:27:31,143 --> 00:27:32,744
Sun Ling is a lecherous man,

477
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:34,024
abusing his father's power

478
00:27:34,303 --> 00:27:36,463
to tyrannize Yezhou's citizens
and harass women.

479
00:27:36,704 --> 00:27:38,783
The people are afraid
to speak their anger openly.

480
00:27:39,103 --> 00:27:40,823
Sun Xiangfu is cautious
and stays in line,

481
00:27:41,664 --> 00:27:42,504
but he is responsible

482
00:27:42,904 --> 00:27:43,744
for his son.

483
00:27:44,264 --> 00:27:45,984
His son will surely drag him down.

484
00:27:46,783 --> 00:27:47,623
Young Master.

485
00:27:47,664 --> 00:27:48,504
In that case,

486
00:27:48,744 --> 00:27:50,583
shouldn't we head
to the Sun residence now?

487
00:27:50,863 --> 00:27:52,303
The stage is set,

488
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,583
and the actors will soon arrive.

489
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:56,863
We'll move once they're here.

490
00:27:57,783 --> 00:27:58,704
Missing this chance

491
00:27:59,383 --> 00:28:00,383
would be a shame.

492
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:18,583
Gentlemen,

493
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:19,744
please come inside.

494
00:28:25,024 --> 00:28:25,864
This way.

495
00:28:28,184 --> 00:28:29,024
Sir,

496
00:28:29,024 --> 00:28:29,864
please.

497
00:28:33,335 --> 00:28:38,248
(Guests Filling the Halls)

498
00:28:39,944 --> 00:28:40,784
Commander.

499
00:28:44,343 --> 00:28:45,183
Uncle.

500
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,583
Why not stay at the Sun residence?

501
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:48,024
No rush.

502
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:53,063
How many rooms would you like?

503
00:28:53,464 --> 00:28:54,304
Three.

504
00:28:54,504 --> 00:28:55,344
Two.

505
00:28:58,143 --> 00:28:59,143
We two share a room.

506
00:28:59,944 --> 00:29:01,343
Why should I share a room with you?

507
00:29:01,623 --> 00:29:02,463
Because...

508
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:07,016
I'm your nephew.

509
00:29:07,016 --> 00:29:09,143
You won't even pay for another room?

510
00:29:10,743 --> 00:29:11,583
Three rooms.

511
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,423
Alright.

512
00:29:13,984 --> 00:29:14,824
You...

513
00:29:14,904 --> 00:29:16,264
Don't leave your room tonight.

514
00:29:20,104 --> 00:29:20,944
Waiter.

515
00:29:20,944 --> 00:29:21,784
Coming.

516
00:29:22,904 --> 00:29:25,303
Do you serve
mushroom and chicken stew here?

517
00:29:25,343 --> 00:29:26,183
Yes.

518
00:29:26,543 --> 00:29:27,383
Bring us a portion.

519
00:29:27,383 --> 00:29:29,024
Uncle, you know well

520
00:29:29,063 --> 00:29:31,424
how much I adore
mushroom and chicken stew.

521
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:34,704
Mushroom and chicken stew,

522
00:29:35,103 --> 00:29:36,103
Eight-Treasure Duck,

523
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:37,543
vegetables, soup,

524
00:29:37,783 --> 00:29:38,623
and six steamed buns.

525
00:29:39,343 --> 00:29:40,183
Okay.

526
00:29:40,984 --> 00:29:42,504
(Just having one more room)

527
00:29:42,543 --> 00:29:43,664
(and ordering one dish)

528
00:29:44,143 --> 00:29:46,024
(deserves those judgmental looks?)

529
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:47,704
(So stingy.)

530
00:29:48,984 --> 00:29:49,824
Wait.

531
00:29:50,783 --> 00:29:51,704
I'll have

532
00:29:52,063 --> 00:29:54,103
spicy tripe strips, sesame rolls,

533
00:29:54,103 --> 00:29:56,583
shredded chicken with cucumber,
five-flavored steamed gluten,

534
00:29:56,584 --> 00:29:57,583
aromatic young pigeon,

535
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:59,464
and also that

536
00:30:00,143 --> 00:30:01,224
mung bean dough noodles.

537
00:30:01,224 --> 00:30:02,823
Yes, all of them.

538
00:30:02,823 --> 00:30:04,223
- Okay.
- Can you finish all this?

539
00:30:08,744 --> 00:30:09,584
Uncle,

540
00:30:10,103 --> 00:30:11,623
you wouldn't let your nephew

541
00:30:11,823 --> 00:30:12,984
go hungry, would you?

542
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:18,783
Serve what he ordered.

543
00:30:19,264 --> 00:30:20,104
Alright.

544
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:39,344
Enjoy your meal.

545
00:30:40,823 --> 00:30:42,248
Since these are your favorite food,

546
00:30:42,744 --> 00:30:44,343
I naturally let you eat them.

547
00:30:45,024 --> 00:30:46,184
But I taught you this.

548
00:30:46,623 --> 00:30:47,583
Save and thrive,

549
00:30:48,024 --> 00:30:48,984
waste and perish.

550
00:30:50,024 --> 00:30:50,984
Don't waste anything.

551
00:30:56,504 --> 00:30:58,024
(I've really overdone it now.)

552
00:31:23,543 --> 00:31:25,863
I'm stuffed!

553
00:31:26,863 --> 00:31:28,872
Now that I'm full, I'm getting drowsy.

554
00:31:28,872 --> 00:31:31,264
This bed is amazingly comfortable!

555
00:31:33,463 --> 00:31:36,543
I'll definitely sleep well.

556
00:31:37,464 --> 00:31:39,264
He eats well and sleeps soundly.

557
00:31:39,823 --> 00:31:42,303
If you're still energetic,
play chess with me.

558
00:32:14,863 --> 00:32:15,703
Commander,

559
00:32:15,783 --> 00:32:16,783
really playing chess?

560
00:32:17,424 --> 00:32:18,264
But I...

561
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:25,543
Yezhou City has unexpected people.

562
00:32:26,224 --> 00:32:27,264
This is getting exciting.

563
00:32:27,783 --> 00:32:29,143
Investigate the Sun family again.

564
00:32:29,623 --> 00:32:31,464
Find their recent tax records.

565
00:32:31,944 --> 00:32:33,424
Let's see how Sun Xiangfu

566
00:32:34,103 --> 00:32:35,823
claims military provisions are lacking

567
00:32:36,024 --> 00:32:37,264
and he can't allocate rations.

568
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:38,864
Yes.

569
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:40,623
Commander,

570
00:32:40,984 --> 00:32:41,824
what about He Yan?

571
00:32:42,224 --> 00:32:43,343
I'll keep watch personally.

572
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:16,903
♪Light shines upon my heart♪

573
00:33:17,007 --> 00:33:20,927
♪Unveiling scars,
