(Nor will I let Rundu fall.)

25
00:02:29,477 --> 00:02:30,477
What are you doing here?

26
00:02:30,677 --> 00:02:32,318
I told you she was suspicious.

27
00:02:32,558 --> 00:02:33,438
You didn't believe me.

28
00:02:34,278 --> 00:02:35,517
Looks like you're leaving.

29
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:36,718
Where are you going?

30
00:02:39,558 --> 00:02:40,398
To Rundu.

31
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:41,957
It's not far from Huayuan,

32
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:43,318
serving as a stronghold.

33
00:02:43,637 --> 00:02:44,477
The enemies

34
00:02:44,637 --> 00:02:45,677
failed to take Huayuan,

35
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:46,917
so they might divert

36
00:02:47,438 --> 00:02:48,278
to attack Rundu.

37
00:02:49,118 --> 00:02:51,278
Even if what you said is true,

38
00:02:51,398 --> 00:02:52,238
what can you do

39
00:02:52,477 --> 00:02:53,317
alone?

40
00:02:54,278 --> 00:02:55,118
An old friend of mine

41
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:56,677
is currently in Rundu.

42
00:02:57,438 --> 00:02:59,398
I can't stand by while he's in danger.

43
00:03:00,197 --> 00:03:01,037
If that's the case,

44
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:02,238
let's go together.

45
00:03:02,957 --> 00:03:03,797
No.

46
00:03:03,957 --> 00:03:05,158
Leaving without permission

47
00:03:05,278 --> 00:03:06,517
will get you punished.

48
00:03:06,998 --> 00:03:07,838
Moreover,

49
00:03:09,118 --> 00:03:10,477
Rundu is extremely dangerous now.

50
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,038
If it's that dangerous,

51
00:03:13,118 --> 00:03:14,838
we can't let a woman

52
00:03:14,838 --> 00:03:15,917
face this peril alone.

53
00:03:16,558 --> 00:03:17,398
Exactly!

54
00:03:17,637 --> 00:03:18,637
Let's go together.

55
00:03:23,957 --> 00:03:24,797
When

56
00:03:27,118 --> 00:03:28,158
did you know this?

57
00:03:30,118 --> 00:03:32,797
When you went to Jiyang with Commander.

58
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,237
That woman looks familiar.

59
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:41,077
Did we see her somewhere before?

60
00:03:41,517 --> 00:03:44,517
Don't you think she looks like He Yan?

61
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:45,757
Well,

62
00:03:46,278 --> 00:03:47,757
is that person

63
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:49,558
He's sister?

64
00:03:49,957 --> 00:03:50,838
Not his sister.

65
00:03:51,517 --> 00:03:52,558
That's He Yan herself.

66
00:03:54,357 --> 00:03:55,838
I knew it!

67
00:03:56,598 --> 00:03:58,357
He is fair-skinned.

68
00:03:59,118 --> 00:04:00,598
Turns out to be a woman.

69
00:04:00,797 --> 00:04:02,278
If He Yan is truly female,

70
00:04:02,357 --> 00:04:04,477
that's a big surprise.

71
00:04:04,998 --> 00:04:05,838
Wait,

72
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:07,077
but He dressed

73
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:08,118
in men's clothes

74
00:04:08,357 --> 00:04:09,398
all the time.

75
00:04:09,398 --> 00:04:11,077
But he's changed his clothes...

76
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:15,197
He's a she!

77
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:16,997
What should we call her now?

78
00:04:17,278 --> 00:04:18,198
He, naturally.

79
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:20,358
Miss He?

80
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:21,317
Anyway,

81
00:04:21,518 --> 00:04:22,638
let's keep her secret.

82
00:04:25,038 --> 00:04:26,878
You knew my identity all along,

83
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:28,518
yet you kept it secret?

84
00:04:29,838 --> 00:04:30,678
Of course.

85
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,237
Otherwise, you'll get expelled

86
00:04:32,518 --> 00:04:33,518
for breaking rules.

87
00:04:36,518 --> 00:04:38,038
Even knowing I hide stuff from you,

88
00:04:38,797 --> 00:04:39,997
you still treat me the same.

89
00:04:41,278 --> 00:04:42,118
I am

90
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:43,917
truly grateful.

91
00:04:44,398 --> 00:04:46,198
Enough with the sentimental talk.

92
00:04:46,237 --> 00:04:48,117
You're giving me goosebumps.

93
00:04:48,198 --> 00:04:49,237
Alright.

94
00:04:49,597 --> 00:04:50,437
However,

95
00:04:50,437 --> 00:04:51,958
you can't go with me.

96
00:04:52,077 --> 00:04:52,917
Why not?

97
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:53,797
If you can go,

98
00:04:53,797 --> 00:04:54,917
why can't we?

99
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:56,758
Exactly! We're going together.

100
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,078
She's now a military attendant,

101
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,437
not a regional commander.

102
00:04:59,877 --> 00:05:00,797
Yet it's an emergency.

103
00:05:02,198 --> 00:05:03,038
I'll go with you all.

104
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:05,758
You don't have to.

105
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:08,136
As Director of the Ministry of War,

106
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:09,960
overseeing military affairs is my job.

107
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:10,958
How can I sit on this?

108
00:05:17,557 --> 00:05:18,397
Well...

109
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:20,798
The more hands,

110
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:22,118
the better.

111
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:23,558
Isn't it good?

112
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,278
You're going

113
00:05:25,437 --> 00:05:26,398
for official business,

114
00:05:26,877 --> 00:05:28,598
while I'm going for personal reasons.

115
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:32,078
What makes you think so?

116
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:35,598
Why are you alone?

117
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:36,838
Where's Yingxiang?

118
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:38,157
It happened abruptly.

119
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:39,838
I sent her to handle something.

120
00:05:41,117 --> 00:05:41,997
Enough.

121
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:43,317
Let's not dawdle any longer.

122
00:05:43,838 --> 00:05:44,678
Come on.

123
00:05:45,557 --> 00:05:46,397
Go.

124
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,744
(Battlefield in Rundu)

125
00:06:21,117 --> 00:06:23,117
We'll arrive in Rundu soon.

126
00:06:24,237 --> 00:06:25,077
I'm afraid

127
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:26,917
we can't enter through the city gates.

128
00:06:30,718 --> 00:06:31,758
You were right.

129
00:06:32,398 --> 00:06:33,718
Wutuo is attacking Rundu.

130
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:35,518
It seems

131
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:37,357
He Rufei hasn't come.

132
00:06:38,638 --> 00:06:39,598
(He Rufei.)

133
00:06:39,997 --> 00:06:41,357
(You knew I'd come, didn't you?)

134
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:43,957
(Planning to use Wutuo to eliminate me?)

135
00:06:44,557 --> 00:06:45,397
(Guess what?)

136
00:06:45,518 --> 00:06:46,677
(I won't let you succeed.)

137
00:06:46,997 --> 00:06:48,237
Rundu is currently besieged.

138
00:06:48,677 --> 00:06:49,557
How should we proceed?

139
00:06:49,997 --> 00:06:50,837
Follow me.

140
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:52,637
I know of a secret tunnel into the city.

141
00:06:58,812 --> 00:07:01,427
(Commander's Mansion)

142
00:07:06,198 --> 00:07:07,038
Commander.

143
00:07:07,496 --> 00:07:09,128
Reinforcements from Huayuan
haven't come.

144
00:07:09,518 --> 00:07:10,917
Our supplies are exhausted.

145
00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:12,558
If we break through,

146
00:07:13,158 --> 00:07:14,518
we might be able to turn the tide.

147
00:07:15,117 --> 00:07:15,957
Stay calm.

148
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,158
Wutuo's soldiers aren't made of iron.

149
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:19,997
They need provisions too.

150
00:07:20,477 --> 00:07:21,317
Moreover,

151
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:22,718
they've deployed larger forces.

152
00:07:23,237 --> 00:07:24,518
They need more supply.

153
00:07:25,317 --> 00:07:26,758
Without a quick victory,

154
00:07:27,117 --> 00:07:28,038
their morale

155
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,437
will dwindle faster than ours.

156
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:30,357
But...

157
00:07:30,357 --> 00:07:31,398
Unrest is spreading.

158
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:32,718
Some grow restless,

159
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:33,558
afraid of chaos.

160
00:07:33,838 --> 00:07:35,038
Deploy patrols

161
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:36,557
to maintain order day and night.

162
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:37,837
As you command.

163
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:39,998
Mr. Wang.

164
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:41,157
Master.

165
00:07:42,357 --> 00:07:43,197
Why are you here?

166
00:07:44,437 --> 00:07:46,158
(Qi Luo, Li Kuang's concubine)
You haven't eaten all day.

167
00:07:46,398 --> 00:07:47,718
That's not good.

168
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:49,718
If Wutuo attacks again,

169
00:07:49,838 --> 00:07:51,317
we need you to lead us.

170
00:07:53,078 --> 00:07:54,038
You stay out

171
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:54,917
of military affairs.

172
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:56,997
I apologize.

173
00:07:57,317 --> 00:07:58,157
Leave us now.

174
00:07:58,317 --> 00:07:59,278
I have official matters.

175
00:08:00,357 --> 00:08:01,197
Yes.

176
00:08:04,398 --> 00:08:05,437
Why hasn't General Feihong

177
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:06,877
arrived yet?

178
00:08:07,477 --> 00:08:08,477
Huayuan isn't far

179
00:08:08,477 --> 00:08:09,317
from Rundu.

180
00:08:09,718 --> 00:08:11,237
Rundu is tightly encircled.

181
00:08:11,797 --> 00:08:13,078
Even General Feihong will

182
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:14,518
struggle to break through.

183
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:15,757
Commander!

184
00:08:16,397 --> 00:08:17,997
- Commander!
- What's it?

185
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,158
Intruders have infiltrated.

186
00:08:19,717 --> 00:08:20,557
What?

187
00:08:20,557 --> 00:08:21,518
Could they be

188
00:08:21,557 --> 00:08:22,397
reinforcements?

189
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:29,558
General!

190
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:35,597
(Not him?)

191
00:08:36,638 --> 00:08:37,998
(But he looks like...)

192
00:08:39,398 --> 00:08:40,238
Well,

193
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,318
who are you?

194
00:08:44,837 --> 00:08:46,638
I'm He Yan, a military attendant.

195
00:08:46,957 --> 00:08:47,878
Nice to meet you.

196
00:08:48,837 --> 00:08:49,797
He Yan?

197
00:08:50,158 --> 00:08:51,238
Rundu is being besieged

198
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:52,118
by Wutuo.

199
00:08:52,717 --> 00:08:53,797
How did you enter?

200
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:55,757
Commander Li.

201
00:08:57,398 --> 00:08:58,358
This isn't the place

202
00:08:58,358 --> 00:08:59,278
for discussions.

203
00:09:00,478 --> 00:09:02,437
I'm Chu Zhao,
Director of the Ministry of War.

204
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:08,758
You two, come with me.

205
00:09:09,118 --> 00:09:10,238
The rest, wait outside.

206
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:17,677
What's wrong with him?

207
00:09:23,117 --> 00:09:23,957
When General Feihong

208
00:09:23,957 --> 00:09:24,957
garrisoned Rundu,

209
00:09:25,158 --> 00:09:26,557
he ordered me to dig a tunnel

210
00:09:26,717 --> 00:09:27,557
leading out of town.

211
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:28,758
Besides us two,

212
00:09:28,758 --> 00:09:29,837
only trusted aides knew it.

213
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:31,437
No one else

214
00:09:31,478 --> 00:09:32,398
could know about it.

215
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:34,478
How did you enter?

216
00:09:45,478 --> 00:09:46,998
If I'm correct,

217
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:48,712
the letter for help was sent

218
00:09:48,837 --> 00:09:49,998
through that tunnel, right?

219
00:09:51,237 --> 00:09:53,317
How do you know
General Feihong's grappling skills?

220
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:02,118
I served in the Fuyue Army

221
00:10:03,317 --> 00:10:04,638
as a garrison officer in Huayuan

222
00:10:04,998 --> 00:10:06,878
under General Wang Qi.

223
00:10:08,638 --> 00:10:09,917
He taught me grappling skills.

224
00:10:10,597 --> 00:10:11,478
He told me

225
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:12,917
about the secret tunnel.

226
00:10:14,158 --> 00:10:14,998
But rest assured,

227
00:10:15,238 --> 00:10:16,597
I haven't disclosed it to anyone.

228
00:10:17,398 --> 00:10:18,717
What brings you here?

229
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:22,677
I hear Rundu is besieged

230
00:10:23,077 --> 00:10:24,077
and you're in danger.

231
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:25,238
So, I rushed here.

232
00:10:31,118 --> 00:10:31,958
Just for that?

233
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:33,557
If the city falls,

234
00:10:34,118 --> 00:10:36,118
no one in this city will survive.

235
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:38,197
As a soldier
sworn to protect the nation,

236
00:10:38,398 --> 00:10:39,597
how could I stand by?

237
00:10:41,638 --> 00:10:42,478
Moreover,

238
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:43,917
this is also to repay

239
00:10:44,038 --> 00:10:45,358
General Wang Qi's trust in me.

240
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:47,077
I wish to help.

241
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:54,157
Master.

242
00:10:54,158 --> 00:10:54,998
You're injured.

243
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:56,317
How are you doing?

244
00:10:56,597 --> 00:10:58,597
Let me get medicine for you.

245
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:00,317
A woman like you

246
00:11:00,557 --> 00:11:01,717
always makes a big fuss.

247
00:11:01,957 --> 00:11:03,077
It's just a minor injury.

248
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,557
I apologize.

249
00:11:08,998 --> 00:11:10,638
Madam, you're quite considerate.

250
00:11:11,478 --> 00:11:12,597
You did nothing wrong.

251
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:13,878
Don't blame yourself.

252
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,437
Mr. He's grappling technique

253
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:22,437
is truly impressive.

254
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,797
Commander,

255
00:11:26,197 --> 00:11:28,077
what do you think of

256
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:29,118
Mr. He's skill?

257
00:11:29,837 --> 00:11:30,758
It's impressive.

258
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:34,118
Surprisingly, you already
master Fuyue Army's footwork

259
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:36,398
and techniques.

260
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:37,878
I see Wang Qi has

261
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:39,358
taught you everything he knew.

262
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:40,318
By the way,

263
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:41,238
how is Wang Qi

264
00:11:41,238 --> 00:11:42,078
doing lately?

265
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:01,317
I'll toast you with tea

266
00:12:01,717 --> 00:12:02,677
to thank you

267
00:12:02,837 --> 00:12:04,118
for helping settle my buddies.

268
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:14,038
Rundu has been besieged for days.

269
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:16,278
The secret tunnel is cramped,

270
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,317
and I fear the enemy will find it.

271
00:12:18,597 --> 00:12:19,635
I can't use it frequently.

272
00:12:19,998 --> 00:12:22,597
I am ill-informed right now.

273
00:12:22,878 --> 00:12:23,718
I hope

274
00:12:24,197 --> 00:12:25,797
you can update me.

275
00:12:26,478 --> 00:12:28,358
The news that Rundu is being besieged

276
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,478
has been deliberately suppressed.

277
00:12:30,797 --> 00:12:31,998
Yezhou Garrison hasn't heard.

278
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,957
Even nearby Huayuan

279
00:12:34,118 --> 00:12:35,317
shows no signs of action.

280
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:36,878
Furthermore,

281
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:37,957
there's something else.

282
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:39,557
When we

283
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:40,638
used the secret tunnel,

284
00:12:41,077 --> 00:12:43,118
Wutuo soldiers seemed to notice.

285
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:44,677
To prevent them

286
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,358
from using the tunnel to enter,

287
00:12:46,797 --> 00:12:48,197
we sealed the tunnel.

288
00:12:48,837 --> 00:12:50,077
It is now impassable.

289
00:12:51,957 --> 00:12:52,797
Sorry, we did that

290
00:12:52,837 --> 00:12:54,077
without your permission.

291
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:55,598
Never mind.

292
00:12:57,197 --> 00:12:58,037
That tunnel

293
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:00,797
has limited use, anyway.

294
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:02,597
Rest assured, Commander Li,

295
00:13:02,957 --> 00:13:04,238
I'll find solutions

296
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:06,238
to ensure our soldiers and citizens

297
00:13:06,398 --> 00:13:07,238
aren't left helpless.

298
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:10,118
I've instructed Yingxiang

299
00:13:10,278 --> 00:13:11,597
to spread the information

300
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,196
and written to Ministry of War.

301
00:13:13,638 --> 00:13:14,478
I suppose

302
00:13:14,758 --> 00:13:16,317
the capital must be informed.

303
00:13:17,478 --> 00:13:18,398
So,

304
00:13:18,518 --> 00:13:19,758
you had Yingxiang

305
00:13:19,837 --> 00:13:20,717
handle that matter.

306
00:13:23,038 --> 00:13:24,317
But distant help

307
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,917
can't quench present fires.

308
00:13:27,358 --> 00:13:28,198
To be frank,

309
00:13:28,717 --> 00:13:29,957
we're running out of food.

310
00:13:30,557 --> 00:13:31,638
We won't last long.

311
00:13:32,638 --> 00:13:34,478
Before supplies run out,

312
00:13:35,437 --> 00:13:37,197
we can only hope General Feihong...

313
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:38,238
Mr. Li.

314
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,238
Have you considered

315
00:13:39,837 --> 00:13:41,518
an attack instead of a defense?

316
00:13:42,158 --> 00:13:43,398
Rather than await doom,

317
00:13:43,797 --> 00:13:45,118
why not take initiative?

318
00:13:46,077 --> 00:13:47,917
A desperate fight sounds good,

319
00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:49,158
but how can I gamble

320
00:13:49,158 --> 00:13:51,437
with tens of thousands of lives?

321
00:13:51,558 --> 00:13:52,398
Moreover,

322
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,677
Rundu is just the first line.

323
00:13:53,757 --> 00:13:55,597
Chonghuai will fall after it.

324
00:13:55,597 --> 00:13:56,837
- Heading north...
- Commander.

325
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:57,677
I...

326
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:00,557
Stop waiting for He Rufei.

327
00:14:05,437 --> 00:14:06,717
Didn't you just ask me

328
00:14:07,837 --> 00:14:09,398
about Wang Qi?

329
00:14:11,197 --> 00:14:12,437
Let me tell you now.

330
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:15,478
He's dead.

331
00:14:20,957 --> 00:14:23,118
He died in the recent Huayuan Battle.

332
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:25,238
Not just Wang Qi,

333
00:14:25,957 --> 00:14:27,597
but your six other buddies

334
00:14:30,238 --> 00:14:31,118
are all dead.

335
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:37,437
Don't you understand yet?

336
00:14:39,638 --> 00:14:40,917
He Rufei

337
00:14:42,478 --> 00:14:43,677
won't come.

338
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:48,398
You stay defensive,

339
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:51,157
essentially surrendering
without a fight.

340
00:14:51,677 --> 00:14:54,757
This is truly gambling
with the lives of the citizens.

341
00:14:59,038 --> 00:15:01,158
There's no time left for grief now.

342
00:15:02,437 --> 00:15:03,277
Commander Li,

343
00:15:03,638 --> 00:15:05,118
we can't just wait for death.

344
00:15:05,557 --> 00:15:06,998
We must take the initiative.

345
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:08,318
Tell me.

346
00:15:08,398 --> 00:15:09,238
How has the enemy

347
00:15:09,238 --> 00:15:10,278
been attacking recently?

348
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:13,077
In the last ten days,

349
00:15:13,557 --> 00:15:14,797
there were five nights

350
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:17,038
when they attacked the city gates.

351
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,317
Though they withdrew each time,

352
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:23,317
it seemed like a test.

353
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,038
In the last three days,

354
00:15:27,038 --> 00:15:28,437
they have gone silent.

355
00:15:29,398 --> 00:15:30,638
Based on my experience

356
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:32,358
fighting them,

357
00:15:32,837 --> 00:15:33,797
their silence

358
00:15:35,158 --> 00:15:36,317
doesn't bode well.

359
00:15:37,758 --> 00:15:38,598
I guess they are

360
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:40,717
planning a full-scale assault.

361
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:43,317
They've thoroughly assessed our defense

362
00:15:43,478 --> 00:15:44,478
by now.

363
00:15:45,238 --> 00:15:46,358
Our forces in Rundu

364
00:15:46,677 --> 00:15:48,917
have been worn down
after days of fighting.

365
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:50,358
Soldiers' morale and stamina

366
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:51,518
are getting worse.

367
00:15:52,358 --> 00:15:53,917
If they launch an attack now,

368
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:55,118
the city gates

369
00:15:55,398 --> 00:15:56,358
will surely fall.

370
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,197
Sounds like you know them pretty well.

371
00:16:02,957 --> 00:16:03,797
Commander Li,

372
00:16:04,038 --> 00:16:05,077
you're missing the point.

373
00:16:10,197 --> 00:16:11,037
Look,

374
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:12,118
it's not that

375
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:13,278
we refuse to be proactive,

376
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:15,637
but our forces are already limited.

377
00:16:15,797 --> 00:16:16,797
Right now, the enemies

378
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:18,077
are watching the gate.

379
00:16:19,197 --> 00:16:20,077
I fear

380
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:21,638
our men will be shot with arrows

381
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:23,437
before going outside the city gate.

382
00:16:24,437 --> 00:16:25,277
Arrows?

383
00:16:25,438 --> 00:16:26,278
Initially,

384
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,398
when Wutuo troops arrived,

385
00:16:27,758 --> 00:16:29,637
we could fight them on the city walls.

386
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,037
But later,

387
00:16:31,317 --> 00:16:32,677
our arrows dwindled,

388
00:16:32,998 --> 00:16:34,797
while theirs remained plentiful.

389
00:16:35,677 --> 00:16:37,638
Earlier, some tried
to infiltrate their ranks

390
00:16:37,878 --> 00:16:39,197
to assassinate their commander.

391
00:16:39,758 --> 00:16:41,597
But the moment they exited the gate,

392
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:44,358
they were pierced by countless arrows.

393
00:16:45,597 --> 00:16:46,518
Do the enemies

394
00:16:46,998 --> 00:16:47,838
have numerous arrows?

395
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:49,238
Yes.

396
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:53,717
I have a plan.

397
00:16:54,197 --> 00:16:55,118
If executed properly,

398
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:56,968
it can achieve two goals at once.

399
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:26,918
We've waited here long enough.

400
00:17:27,238 --> 00:17:28,518
He Rufei isn't coming.

401
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:30,792
(Nagur, Wutuo's Commander)
The Chancellor was right.

402
00:17:31,678 --> 00:17:32,758
Thankfully, we don't

403
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,117
fight against Xiao Jue.

404
00:17:34,797 --> 00:17:35,637
Report!

405
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:38,157
Commander.

406
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,656
Someone is descending the city walls.

407
00:17:41,637 --> 00:17:42,557
Let's go take a look.

408
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,077
Have they gone mad?

409
00:17:54,117 --> 00:17:56,038
This is suicide!

410
00:17:56,478 --> 00:17:57,637
In our homeland,

411
00:17:57,758 --> 00:17:58,837
there are badgers,

412
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:00,117
which are quite timid.

413
00:18:00,718 --> 00:18:01,918
I hear when hunted,

414
00:18:02,238 --> 00:18:03,198
they don't flee

415
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:04,557
but panic

416
00:18:04,637 --> 00:18:05,797
and run toward the arrows.

417
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:07,038
I think

418
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:09,157
they are the same.

419
00:18:10,438 --> 00:18:11,557
Get archers ready.

420
00:18:12,518 --> 00:18:13,758
Good target practice.

421
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:14,917
Yes!

422
00:18:15,597 --> 00:18:17,038
Archers, take positions!

423
00:18:32,998 --> 00:18:33,838
Shoot!

424
00:18:49,357 --> 00:18:50,238
We have no arrows.

425
00:18:50,757 --> 00:18:51,597
During daylight,

426
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,252
our soldiers don't dare
come up the walls.

427
00:18:53,598 --> 00:18:54,438
Those stationed

428
00:18:54,438 --> 00:18:55,278
on the walls

429
00:18:55,478 --> 00:18:56,678
get hit by arrows every day.

430
00:18:56,878 --> 00:18:58,718
Yet we lack sufficient arrows
to fight back.

431
00:18:59,078 --> 00:19:00,758
Now, we finally have arrows.

432
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:03,077
This tactic feels familiar.

433
00:19:03,478 --> 00:19:04,998
Maybe I've read it in some storybook.

434
00:19:05,517 --> 00:19:07,198
But it works well.

435
00:19:07,918 --> 00:19:10,278
Past lessons guide future actions.

436
00:19:10,757 --> 00:19:11,597
The enemies

437
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:12,877
rely on their superior numbers.

438
00:19:13,198 --> 00:19:14,117
They're too arrogant

439
00:19:14,478 --> 00:19:15,837
to believe they could fail.

440
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,117
These straw dummies

441
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:19,077
won't draw their attention.

442
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,117
They think we have nothing,

443
00:19:21,438 --> 00:19:22,278
no soldiers,

444
00:19:22,278 --> 00:19:23,118
no provisions,

445
00:19:23,198 --> 00:19:24,038
and no help.

446
00:19:24,317 --> 00:19:25,478
So, we'll turn nothing

447
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:26,758
into something.

448
00:19:27,077 --> 00:19:28,157
Catch them unprepared!

449
00:19:29,238 --> 00:19:30,078
But

450
00:19:30,797 --> 00:19:31,958
what if we fail?

451
00:19:33,157 --> 00:19:34,238
Then we find another way.

452
00:19:34,478 --> 00:19:35,318
In this world,

453
00:19:35,557 --> 00:19:36,918
there's never just one way.

454
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:44,918
Report!

455
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:48,198
Commander.

456
00:19:48,198 --> 00:19:49,637
They descend from the walls again.

457
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:53,958
Those reckless fools!

458
00:20:14,518 --> 00:20:15,358
Commander.

459
00:20:15,557 --> 00:20:16,518
What's wrong

460
00:20:16,837 --> 00:20:17,677
with them?

461
00:20:17,998 --> 00:20:18,998
Aren't they afraid?

462
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:20,840
We've rotated archers repeatedly.

463
00:20:29,397 --> 00:20:30,438
When you fired arrows,

464
00:20:31,157 --> 00:20:32,438
did you hear any screams?

465
00:20:33,518 --> 00:20:34,358
Today,

466
00:20:34,438 --> 00:20:35,278
I didn't.

467
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:37,118
Stop!

468
00:20:37,797 --> 00:20:38,797
Stop shooting right now!

469
00:20:44,718 --> 00:20:45,558
So many arrows.

470
00:20:45,598 --> 00:20:46,438
Pull them out!

471
00:20:46,438 --> 00:20:47,278
Come on.

472
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:00,878
General.

473
00:21:01,397 --> 00:21:02,758
They are descending again.

474
00:21:06,397 --> 00:21:07,637
Do they think we are

475
00:21:07,877 --> 00:21:09,238
giving arrows to them again?

476
00:21:13,198 --> 00:21:14,038
Pass the order.

477
00:21:15,238 --> 00:21:16,078
Fire a few arrows.

478
00:21:16,438 --> 00:21:17,357
Even if we break ours,

479
00:21:18,117 --> 00:21:19,117
we won't let them

480
00:21:19,198 --> 00:21:20,758
get our arrows again!

481
00:21:21,518 --> 00:21:22,358
Understood.

482
00:21:38,918 --> 00:21:39,758
(Three Days Earlier)
Today,

483
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:40,877
we didn't scream.

484
00:21:41,397 --> 00:21:42,478
Won't the enemies realize

485
00:21:42,478 --> 00:21:43,318
our true purpose?

486
00:21:43,518 --> 00:21:44,358
It's hard

487
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:45,477
to fool them again.

488
00:21:46,198 --> 00:21:47,038
I made straw dummies

489
00:21:47,317 --> 00:21:48,518
not just to get arrows.

490
00:21:48,797 --> 00:21:49,758
After tonight,

491
00:21:49,918 --> 00:21:50,758
the enemies

492
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:52,438
must sense something's wrong.

493
00:21:52,718 --> 00:21:53,558
That's for sure.

494
00:21:55,877 --> 00:21:56,717
Mr. Li,

495
00:21:56,877 --> 00:21:58,038
if you were the enemy

496
00:21:58,438 --> 00:22:00,637
and realized you'd been fooled
all night,

497
00:22:00,998 --> 00:22:02,317
then saw the same trick today

498
00:22:02,518 --> 00:22:03,718
and again tomorrow,

499
00:22:04,117 --> 00:22:04,957
what would you do?

500
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:05,997
Never fall for it.

501
00:22:06,637 --> 00:22:09,077
Stop shooting at people
descending the walls?

502
00:22:09,238 --> 00:22:10,078
Exactly.

503
00:22:10,317 --> 00:22:11,157
Perfect.

504
00:22:11,478 --> 00:22:12,318
Next time,

505
00:22:12,318 --> 00:22:13,958
our troops can exit the city directly.

506
00:22:14,637 --> 00:22:15,998
The enemies will assume

507
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:17,637
anyone descending the walls

508
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:20,157
is just another straw dummy.

509
00:22:29,637 --> 00:22:30,477
Mother,

510
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:32,278
I beg you

511
00:22:32,998 --> 00:22:34,317
to protect He Yan

512
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:36,797
and let her return safely.

513
00:22:39,611 --> 00:22:41,768
(Wutuo's Barracks)

514
00:23:24,518 --> 00:23:25,358
Come.

515
00:23:27,557 --> 00:23:28,397
We should

516
00:23:28,397 --> 00:23:30,238
split up and locate the granaries first.

517
00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:31,238
Listen,

518
00:23:31,238 --> 00:23:32,157
stay cautious.

519
00:23:32,317 --> 00:23:33,157
Got it?

520
00:23:33,837 --> 00:23:36,357
Are the oil packets ready?

521
00:23:36,438 --> 00:23:37,397
The oil.

522
00:23:38,397 --> 00:23:39,518
Right here!

523
00:23:40,317 --> 00:23:41,157
Move!

524
00:23:41,157 --> 00:23:42,958
- Let's go!
- Move!

525
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:43,918
- Go!
- Go!

526
00:23:58,158 --> 00:23:58,998
Help!

527
00:23:58,998 --> 00:23:59,838
Stop right there.

528
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:01,197
Come here!

529
00:24:01,678 --> 00:24:02,518
Come on.

530
00:24:03,957 --> 00:24:04,797
Stop running.

531
00:24:04,797 --> 00:24:05,637
Be good.

532
00:24:08,157 --> 00:24:09,278
Help!

533
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:10,118
Don't run!

534
00:24:10,758 --> 00:24:11,598
Go over.

535
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:12,918
Get over here!

536
00:24:14,198 --> 00:24:15,038
Let go of me!

537
00:24:15,837 --> 00:24:16,677
Let go of me!

538
00:24:17,597 --> 00:24:18,438
Come on.

539
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:19,597
Let go of me!

540
00:24:19,597 --> 00:24:20,437
He.

541
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:21,958
I know you pity them.

542
00:24:22,357 --> 00:24:23,397
But now, burning granaries

543
00:24:23,397 --> 00:24:24,237
is our mission.

544
00:24:24,478 --> 00:24:25,438
If we save them now,

545
00:24:25,758 --> 00:24:26,797
Mai and Wang Ba

546
00:24:26,877 --> 00:24:27,717
will get trapped.

547
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:29,198
Our entire plan will fail.

548
00:24:29,398 --> 00:24:30,238
More people will

549
00:24:30,238 --> 00:24:31,078
end up suffering.

550
00:24:32,077 --> 00:24:32,917
Come on.

551
00:24:33,317 --> 00:24:34,157
Come here.

552
00:24:36,077 --> 00:24:36,917
We'll save them

553
00:24:37,397 --> 00:24:38,237
and burn granaries.

554
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,518
Set the fires first,

555
00:24:39,797 --> 00:24:40,637
then rescue them.

556
00:24:46,637 --> 00:24:47,597
Fire!

557
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:48,918
Fire!

558
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:50,278
Put it out!

559
00:24:50,918 --> 00:24:52,117
Fire!

560
00:24:53,637 --> 00:24:54,477
Hurry!

561
00:24:55,198 --> 00:24:56,157
Don't be afraid.

562
00:24:56,918 --> 00:24:57,758
Thank you.

563
00:24:57,797 --> 00:24:58,637
Thank you, sir.

564
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,077
Please save us, sir.

565
00:25:00,438 --> 00:25:01,958
- Please save us.
- Please save us.

566
00:25:04,517 --> 00:25:05,357
Huang.

567
00:25:05,357 --> 00:25:06,557
The fire's already raging.

568
00:25:06,837 --> 00:25:07,877
Take them away.

569
00:25:08,838 --> 00:25:10,478
Remember, don't attempt to fight.

570
00:25:10,478 --> 00:25:11,318
Make sure

571
00:25:11,518 --> 00:25:12,358
that all of us

572
00:25:12,397 --> 00:25:13,278
return safely.

573
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,477
- Yes.
- Yes.

574
00:26:02,797 --> 00:26:03,797
It's General Feihong!

575
00:26:05,358 --> 00:26:06,198
Well...

576
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:07,038
Is it really him?

577
00:26:08,597 --> 00:26:09,998
He Rufei can't be in Rundu.

578
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:11,998
This man is an imposter!

579
00:26:13,518 --> 00:26:15,357
(He Rufei is indeed involved.)

580
00:26:15,718 --> 00:26:16,558
Everyone, attack!

581
00:26:16,837 --> 00:26:17,677
Kill them all!

582
00:26:54,478 --> 00:26:55,318
Qinglang Sword?

583
00:26:56,438 --> 00:26:57,357
The same skills.

584
00:26:58,837 --> 00:27:00,438
Could he be General Feihong?

585
00:27:01,117 --> 00:27:01,957
Move out!

586
00:27:05,918 --> 00:27:06,758
After them!

587
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:07,598
Chase them down!

588
00:27:07,638 --> 00:27:08,478
Kill!

589
00:27:08,478 --> 00:27:09,318
Today,

590
00:27:09,358 --> 00:27:10,198
I swear

591
00:27:10,198 --> 00:27:12,637
I'll kill He Rufei, a faithless man.

592
00:27:19,397 --> 00:27:20,797
(I demanded a squad from Li Kuang.)

593
00:27:21,357 --> 00:27:22,197
I told him

594
00:27:22,597 --> 00:27:24,117
that my team would

595
00:27:24,758 --> 00:27:26,518
definitely burn the enemies' granaries.

596
00:27:26,797 --> 00:27:28,278
When you see flames rise,

597
00:27:28,797 --> 00:27:29,718
it means I succeed.

598
00:27:31,397 --> 00:27:32,237
Okay.

599
00:27:33,077 --> 00:27:34,518
I'll wait for the flames

601
00:27:41,718 --> 00:27:42,558
They did it.

602
00:27:43,837 --> 00:27:44,758

Rundu is besieged.

Chu Zhao went with them too.

651
00:29:44,077 --> 00:29:44,917
So,

652
00:29:45,478 --> 00:29:47,038
given the information you got

653
00:29:47,678 --> 00:29:49,918
and her current act of aiding Rundu,

654
00:29:50,797 --> 00:29:52,077

658
00:30:28,238 --> 00:30:29,438
She took Qinglang.

659
00:30:58,038 --> 00:30:58,918
(Rundu is in peril.)

660
00:30:59,077 --> 00:30:59,917
(I'm going to help.)

666
00:31:59,598 --> 00:32:00,438
Why did you

667
00:32:00,438 --> 00:32:01,478
address He like that?

668
00:32:01,517 --> 00:32:03,357
He isn't a general yet.

669
00:32:10,758 --> 00:32:11,598
This craftsman

670
00:32:11,637 --> 00:32:12,557
has exceptional skills.

671
00:32:13,317 --> 00:32:14,157
The mask he made

672
00:32:14,357 --> 00:32:15,438
looks utterly realistic.

673
00:32:16,758 --> 00:32:17,718
Last night, the enemies

674
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:19,797
were fooled by this disguise too.

675
00:32:19,797 --> 00:32:21,478
They mistook me for General Feihong.

676
00:32:22,718 --> 00:32:24,317
This is truly masterful work.

677
00:32:25,837 --> 00:32:27,157
I also made a mistake.

678
00:32:27,918 --> 00:32:28,958
It's all ready.

679
00:32:31,198 --> 00:32:32,038
Well...

680
00:32:33,797 --> 00:32:35,077
General Feihong?

681
00:32:37,117 --> 00:32:37,957
Mr. Li.

682
00:32:38,397 --> 00:32:39,958
He is just a military attendant,

683
00:32:40,317 --> 00:32:41,438
not yet promoted to general.

684
00:32:43,597 --> 00:32:44,437
I meant,

685
00:32:44,877 --> 00:32:45,758
this mask

686
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:47,597
belonged to General Feihong.

687
00:32:49,198 --> 00:32:50,278
What exactly will you do?

688
00:32:51,557 --> 00:32:52,837
Make a mixture of illusions

689
00:32:53,637 --> 00:32:54,518
and truths.

690
00:32:55,478 --> 00:32:56,718
Even Nagur hasn't seen

691
00:32:56,758 --> 00:32:57,998
the real General Feihong.

692
00:32:58,597 --> 00:32:59,718
But he must have heard

693
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:02,918
about the masked general's
fierce battle against Liehe.

694
00:33:05,518 --> 00:33:08,117
I'll infiltrate the enemy camp
wearing this mask.

695
00:33:09,198 --> 00:33:10,038
They won't know

696
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:12,078
who's truly beneath the mask.

697
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:13,718
Their fear will

698
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,038
destroy their morale.

699
00:33:15,837 --> 00:33:16,677
Then,

700
00:33:17,238 --> 00:33:18,918
we'll seize the opportunity.

701
00:33:24,157 --> 00:33:24,997
Commander Li.

702
00:33:25,518 --> 00:33:26,877
With their provisions burned

703
00:33:27,198 --> 00:33:29,437
and their fear
of General Feihong's presence in Rundu,

704
00:33:29,438 --> 00:33:30,278
I think

705
00:33:30,278 --> 00:33:31,478
they'll observe the situation.

706
00:33:31,797 --> 00:33:33,278
An immediate attack seems unlikely.

707
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,157
This is our opportunity.

708
00:33:35,518 --> 00:33:36,358
Deploy

709
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:37,797
a preemptive strike

710
00:33:38,198 --> 00:33:39,357
to resolve this swiftly

711
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,077
and solve the food crisis.

712
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:44,237
Commander Li.

713
00:33:44,637 --> 00:33:45,998
Our provisions are insufficient.

714
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:47,117
We can't afford delays.

715
00:33:47,397 --> 00:33:48,797
If reinforcements don't come,

716
00:33:49,077 --> 00:33:50,077
people will die.

717
00:33:50,478 --> 00:33:51,837
You're versed in military tactics.

718
00:33:51,837 --> 00:33:52,677
You must know

719
00:33:52,837 --> 00:33:53,677
that defending a city

720
00:33:53,718 --> 00:33:55,117
is doomed if people starve.

721
00:33:56,157 --> 00:33:56,997
Public unrest

722
00:33:57,317 --> 00:33:58,157
breeds chaos.

723
00:34:00,678 --> 00:34:01,518
Commander Li.

724
00:34:02,157 --> 00:34:03,278
With the enemy at our gate,

725
00:34:03,637 --> 00:34:05,117
opportunities vanish quickly.

726
00:34:10,197 --> 00:34:11,037
Alright.

727
00:34:11,117 --> 00:34:12,677
I'll adjust the city's defenses,

728
00:34:12,998 --> 00:34:14,038
take inventory of weapons,

729
00:34:14,438 --> 00:34:15,757
and figure out a solution.

730
00:34:17,117 --> 00:34:17,957
By the way,

731
00:34:18,277 --> 00:34:19,117
one more thing.

732
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:21,077
Regarding the women I rescued,

733
00:34:21,357 --> 00:34:22,197
I need

734
00:34:22,197 --> 00:34:23,798
to trouble you to check

735
00:34:24,157 --> 00:34:25,637
if they have relatives in the city.

736
00:34:26,038 --> 00:34:26,878
If they do,

737
00:34:27,157 --> 00:34:28,918
have their relatives take them home.

738
00:34:29,478 --> 00:34:30,318
If not,

739
00:34:30,757 --> 00:34:31,717
please

740
00:34:31,998 --> 00:34:33,277
properly settle them for me.

741
00:34:36,677 --> 00:34:37,517
Commander Li.

742
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:39,197
I don't care what you think.

743
00:34:39,438 --> 00:34:40,318
These women

744
00:34:40,677 --> 00:34:41,918
are all citizens of Wei.

745
00:34:42,117 --> 00:34:43,358
They're people of Rundu.

746
00:34:44,637 --> 00:34:45,838
As the city's commander,

747
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:47,438
you can't ignore them.

748
00:34:48,237 --> 00:34:49,277
A soldier's duty

749
00:34:49,597 --> 00:34:50,798
is to protect the people,

750
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:52,838
rich or poor,

751
00:34:53,117 --> 00:34:53,957
without considering

752
00:34:54,038 --> 00:34:55,038
what they've experienced.

753
00:34:56,318 --> 00:34:57,158
Fine.

754
00:34:57,358 --> 00:34:58,198
I understand.

755
00:35:05,677 --> 00:35:06,677
You have enough medicine?

756
00:35:07,157 --> 00:35:07,997
Sure.

757
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:09,157
Let me help.

758
00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:09,997
I'll help you.

759
00:35:12,038 --> 00:35:13,237
How's your leg injury?

760
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,358
If you need more ointment,

761
00:35:14,398 --> 00:35:15,438
I'll have them fetch it.

762

Thank you.

763
00:35:16,637 --> 00:35:17,477
It hurts.

764
00:35:17,757 --> 00:35:18,677
Don't worry, everyone,

765
00:35:19,038 --> 00:35:20,237
Master and Mr. He

766
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:21,237

767
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:22,878
From now on,

768
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,557
they won't let you suffer anymore.

769
00:35:29,318 --> 00:35:30,158
Master.

770
00:35:30,677 --> 00:35:31,637
Did you make the congee?

771
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:33,037
Yes.

772
00:35:33,438 --> 00:35:35,277
They haven't eaten for days.

773
00:35:35,798 --> 00:35:37,438
They have lost their virginity.

774
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:39,277
Letting them live is merciful.

775
00:35:39,518 --> 00:35:40,757
They're Rundu's shame!

776
00:35:40,837 --> 00:35:42,597
They don't deserve to eat the food.

777
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:44,358
But

778
00:35:44,677 --> 00:35:46,557
they had no choice!

779
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:48,958
Master, please calm down.

780
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:50,117
Move away!

781
00:35:52,077 --> 00:35:52,917
Madam.

782
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,757
Stop feeding them!

783
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:57,237
Stop it, you hear me!

784
00:36:01,318 --> 00:36:03,277
Throwing your weight around?

785
00:36:04,398 --> 00:36:05,878
Qi Luo is my concubine.

786
00:36:06,237 --> 00:36:07,077
She is shortsighted.

787
00:36:07,637 --> 00:36:08,717
I have the right

788
00:36:09,197 --> 00:36:10,037
to handle my woman.

789
00:36:11,557 --> 00:36:13,237
True, she's your concubine,

790
00:36:13,597 --> 00:36:14,958
but she's not a cargo

791
00:36:15,397 --> 00:36:16,237
or some object

792
00:36:16,237 --> 00:36:17,757
to discard at will.

793
00:36:18,597 --> 00:36:19,998
She's a human being.

794
00:36:26,398 --> 00:36:27,238
And these women

795
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:29,358
are all Rundu's citizens.

796
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:31,157
Food belongs to all.

797
00:36:31,518 --> 00:36:32,878
Why can't they eat?

798
00:36:33,717 --> 00:36:34,557
Li Kuang.

799
00:36:34,557 --> 00:36:35,438
If you

800
00:36:35,438 --> 00:36:37,077
yell at the enemies

801
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:38,197
or kill a few enemies,

802
00:36:38,557 --> 00:36:39,677
I'll respect your courage.

803
00:36:40,237 --> 00:36:41,518
But you're now

804
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:43,997
yelling at helpless women.

805
00:36:44,798 --> 00:36:45,838
That's cowardice!

806
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:47,278
You...

807
00:36:58,518 --> 00:36:59,358
Careful.

808
00:37:00,757 --> 00:37:01,597
Qi Luo.

809
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:02,678
Are you okay?

810
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:04,318
Thank you.

811
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:14,158
Thank you.

812
00:37:16,398 --> 00:37:17,238
Thank you.

813
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,848
(This is)

814
00:37:19,848 --> 00:37:21,358
(tragic reality in this city.)

815
00:37:21,597 --> 00:37:22,437
Thank you.

816
00:37:22,478 --> 00:37:24,237
(We must strategize quickly)

817
00:37:24,717 --> 00:37:25,757
(to repel the enemies.)
