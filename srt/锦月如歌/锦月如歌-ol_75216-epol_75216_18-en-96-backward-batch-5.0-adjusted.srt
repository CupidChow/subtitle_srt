=Episode 18=

23
00:02:33,748 --> 00:02:34,669
Thank you, Commander.

24
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:36,428
Last night,

25
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,148
I behaved too boldly.

26
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:42,976
It's nothing.

27
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:44,669
No one saw us anyway.

28
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:46,949
Even if seen, it wouldn't matter.

29
00:02:47,588 --> 00:02:50,148
The Qiao couple spent
the night on a sampan.

30
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:51,069
If word spreads,

31
00:02:51,468 --> 00:02:52,628
it'll be a romantic story.

32
00:02:55,588 --> 00:02:56,269
Then we will

33
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:58,308
leave openly in the crowds

34
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:00,269
conspicuously.

35
00:03:08,308 --> 00:03:08,864
Commander.

36
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:09,908
Are you alright?

37
00:03:11,628 --> 00:03:12,428
It's my fault.

38
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:14,708
I lay on your arm all night

39
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:16,109
and made your hand go numb.

40
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:17,908
It's fine. Really.

41
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:21,549
You don't need me

42
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:22,708
to massage it for you?

43
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:24,428
Stop being stubborn.

44
00:03:37,188 --> 00:03:37,908
Flatbread.

45
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:39,509
Flatbread.

46
00:03:39,588 --> 00:03:40,188
Flatbread.

47
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:41,468
I want flatbread.

48
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:44,069
Sir.

49
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:45,989
Two flatbreads, please.

50
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:46,912
Alright.

51
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:47,789
A pot of hot tea.

52
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:51,188
Your hot tea.

53
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:51,936
Thank you.

54
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:52,908
Your flatbreads.

55
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:53,920
Enjoy.

56
00:04:12,268 --> 00:04:12,868
Commander.

57
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:14,669
Freshly baked flatbreads.

58
00:04:15,868 --> 00:04:16,748
Don't you want to try?

59
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:20,349
Not hungry.

60
00:04:21,388 --> 00:04:22,589
Such a stick-in-the-mud.

61
00:04:39,828 --> 00:04:40,589
Unlike a Wei man.

62
00:04:41,188 --> 00:04:42,229
When drinking tea earlier,

63
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:44,109
he added salt,

64
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,909
ginger,

65
00:04:45,388 --> 00:04:45,989
and pepper.

66
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:46,549
Exactly.

67
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:48,268
That's a Wutuo custom.

68
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:49,748
It's used to fight

69
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:50,669
the cold.

70
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:19,308
This Wutuo man

71
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:20,508
has accomplices.

72
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:22,109
They're leaving the city.

73
00:05:22,428 --> 00:05:23,589
Should we follow?

74
00:05:28,948 --> 00:05:29,909
Look at those two.

75
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,428
Though the girl is coughing violently,

76
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:36,709
her grandmother

77
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:37,709
shows no concern.

78
00:05:38,268 --> 00:05:39,508
She's gripping the girl's hand

79
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:41,428
like fearing an escape.

80
00:05:41,868 --> 00:05:42,989
That old woman's suspicious.

81
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:44,428
Intercept her.

82
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:47,188
Stop!

83
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:54,229
Hand over the girl.

84
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:56,589
Surrender quietly,

85
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,029
and I'll spare your life.

86
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:00,709
If I can't take this girl,

87
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,669
she'll die here.

88
00:06:30,508 --> 00:06:32,029
These Wutuo people are cunning.

89
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:35,828
He.

90
00:06:37,308 --> 00:06:37,828
Master.

91
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:40,909
Let's leave first.

92
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:42,268
Follow me.

93
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,989
Master, what happened earlier?

94
00:06:50,428 --> 00:06:51,469
Who's this girl?

95
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:52,748
That old woman

96
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:54,029
was a Wutuo spy

97
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:55,149
infiltrating Jiyang.

98
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:56,192
I've been

99
00:06:56,428 --> 00:06:57,229
tracking them

100
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:58,149
for some time.

101
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:00,149
This child

102
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:01,549
is Princess Mengji's daughter.

103
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:03,868
They nearly abducted her earlier.

104
00:07:04,388 --> 00:07:05,748
No wonder Cui Yuezhi's frantic.

105
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:07,388
I'll return first

106
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:08,628
to report finding

107
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:10,388
the kid and the Wutuo spies.

108
00:07:10,989 --> 00:07:12,068
Go with your master

109
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:12,909
to escort the kid.

110
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:18,229
Stay vigilant.

111
00:07:25,332 --> 00:07:27,040
(Herbal Apothecary)

112
00:07:38,428 --> 00:07:39,188
To locate

113
00:07:39,188 --> 00:07:40,149
that injured Wutuo man,

114
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:41,789
we searched many apothecaries

115
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:43,549
but found no trace.

116
00:07:43,828 --> 00:07:44,416
No rush.

117
00:07:44,868 --> 00:07:45,508
He must still be

118
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:46,789
in Jiyang.

119
00:07:49,524 --> 00:07:52,128
(Herb Names)

120
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:09,549
That's him.

121
00:08:12,188 --> 00:08:12,748
Follow him.

122
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:34,388
I was wondering earlier

123
00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:36,829
why the Wutuo people spared me.

124
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,544
(Xu)

125
00:08:41,628 --> 00:08:42,469
Later, I found out

126
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:43,469
it was

127
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:44,388
because they saw

128
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:45,668
the Xu token.

129
00:08:46,508 --> 00:08:47,229
Judging by this,

130
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,268
they are connected to Chancellor Xu,

131
00:08:49,508 --> 00:08:51,109
perhaps even acting under his orders.

132
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:54,628
For Chai Anxi,

133
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,349
so many Wutuo agents have come here.

134
00:08:56,788 --> 00:08:57,868
I fear Jiyang City

135
00:08:58,589 --> 00:08:59,548
is headed for turmoil.

136
00:08:59,923 --> 00:09:06,912
(Cloudbird Manor)

137
00:09:10,148 --> 00:09:11,028
Cloudbird Manor?

138
00:09:11,908 --> 00:09:13,189
Master, why here?

139
00:09:13,548 --> 00:09:14,908
This child's been drugged.

140
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,109
I must go inside

141
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:17,148
to prepare an antidote.

142
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:18,508
Bring her

143
00:09:18,668 --> 00:09:19,349
and follow me in.

144
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,069
Earlier,

145
00:09:44,268 --> 00:09:45,628
who was that gentleman?

146
00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:47,808
Also,

147
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:49,508
why change into women's clothes?

148
00:09:52,148 --> 00:09:54,309
He's General Fengyun, Xiao Jue.

149
00:09:54,989 --> 00:09:55,829
We came to Jiyang

150
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:56,949
on official business.

151
00:09:57,628 --> 00:09:58,709
As for the clothing change,

152
00:09:59,268 --> 00:10:00,388
it's to conceal my identity.

153
00:10:02,908 --> 00:10:04,829
So that's General Fengyun.

154
00:10:06,028 --> 00:10:07,109
No wonder he immediately

155
00:10:07,268 --> 00:10:08,349
started giving you orders.

156
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,388
He's the Right Army Commander.

157
00:10:11,748 --> 00:10:12,508
I'm just one

158
00:10:12,508 --> 00:10:13,189
of his soldiers.

159
00:10:13,508 --> 00:10:14,709
Of course he can order me.

160
00:10:16,989 --> 00:10:18,388
You seem quite protective of him.

161
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:19,840
What?

162
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:20,908
Do you like him?

163
00:10:31,148 --> 00:10:31,908
Between us,

164
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:34,189
there's indeed some history.

165
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:36,788
But my own path

166
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:38,508
is not yet clear.

167
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,788
I suppose

168
00:10:41,788 --> 00:10:43,148
nothing will come of it.

169
00:10:46,148 --> 00:10:48,069
Let me divine

170
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:48,829
your fates.

171
00:11:30,508 --> 00:11:32,309
The hexagram is Kan.

172
00:11:33,268 --> 00:11:34,268
It represents water.

173
00:11:34,788 --> 00:11:35,989
From peril to greater peril.

174
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,508
Trapped between dangers

175
00:11:37,748 --> 00:11:38,709
with no escape in sight.

176
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,908
Does this mean

177
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:43,388
being with him would bring

178
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:44,908
certain disaster?

179
00:11:50,548 --> 00:11:51,508
Remember what I said

180
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:52,429
earlier?

181
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:54,109
It signifies danger,

182
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,309
but water is adaptable.

183
00:11:56,709 --> 00:11:58,069
Navigate through hazards

184
00:11:58,469 --> 00:11:59,788
and find passage in peril.

185
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:05,148
Human conquers fate.

186
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:06,829
Don't bow to destiny.

187
00:12:59,148 --> 00:13:00,748
That melody sounds so familiar.

188
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:02,829
My mother often plays this

189
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:04,469
in her leisure time.

190
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:06,469
I think it's called

191
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:08,589
Slow Passing Years.

192
00:13:14,771 --> 00:13:18,432
(Cloudbird Manor)

193
00:13:29,748 --> 00:13:31,628
(Clouds and birds fade from memory.)

194
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:35,189
(One day, we'll reunite
at the city tower.)

195
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:37,189
(Cloudbird Manor.)

196
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:39,309
(So that's how it is.)

197
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:47,539
(Cloudbird Manor)

198
00:13:54,388 --> 00:13:55,109
Mr. Cui,

199
00:13:55,388 --> 00:13:56,469
you've finally arrived.

200
00:14:00,469 --> 00:14:01,268
Sorry for the delay.

201
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:03,069
Are you okay?

202
00:14:03,748 --> 00:14:04,268
I nearly

203
00:14:04,349 --> 00:14:05,148
came close to

204
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:06,069
being killed.

205
00:14:06,469 --> 00:14:08,028
Mr. Liu saved me.

206
00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:12,189
I'm Cui Yuezhi.

207
00:14:12,628 --> 00:14:13,469
My deepest gratitude

208
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:15,109
for saving the little princess.

209
00:14:15,349 --> 00:14:16,788
Thanks to your information

210
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:18,349
about the Wutuo spies,

211
00:14:18,668 --> 00:14:19,309
I've sent people

212
00:14:19,469 --> 00:14:20,429
to catch them.

213
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:21,548
It was nothing.

214
00:14:21,908 --> 00:14:22,949
Don't mention it.

215
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:24,229
You'd better return

216
00:14:24,788 --> 00:14:25,908
with the little princess.

217
00:14:26,229 --> 00:14:26,868
We shouldn't let

218
00:14:27,268 --> 00:14:28,349
her elders worry.

219
00:14:29,109 --> 00:14:29,788
Of course.

220
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:31,589
I should report this

221
00:14:31,748 --> 00:14:32,668
to Princess Mengji.

222
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:33,989
Would you

223
00:14:33,989 --> 00:14:34,829
accompany me?

224
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:36,668
When she learns

225
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,069
of your heroic deed,

226
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:40,469
she'll surely reward you generously.

227
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:42,868
I avoid worldly ties.

228
00:14:43,328 --> 00:14:43,868
No need.

229
00:14:44,868 --> 00:14:45,908
Alright, alright.

230
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:47,788
Your Highness.

231
00:14:48,229 --> 00:14:48,800
After you.

232
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:52,268
Mr. Liu.

233
00:14:52,628 --> 00:14:53,349
Visit me sometime.

234
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:03,388
He.

235
00:15:04,148 --> 00:15:04,788
You two

236
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:05,829
may return.

237
00:15:06,268 --> 00:15:06,908
Be careful.

238
00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:08,949
- Yes.
- Yes.

239
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:19,424
What's wrong?

240
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:21,548
Your master

241
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:23,668
cares a lot about the little princess.

242
00:15:25,109 --> 00:15:27,589
He rarely speaks of the past.

243
00:15:28,508 --> 00:15:29,748
But I can sense

244
00:15:30,268 --> 00:15:32,028
he harbors many regrets in his heart

245
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,148
and sorrows.

246
00:15:34,748 --> 00:15:36,109
I don't want to see him sad.

247
00:15:36,668 --> 00:15:37,229
That's why

248
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:39,469
I never mention it.

249
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:47,827
(Mengji Mansion, Jiyang)

250
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:52,340
(Cultivate Virtue)

251
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:05,189
The little princess

252
00:16:05,388 --> 00:16:06,628
entered to see Princess Mengji.

253
00:16:06,868 --> 00:16:07,788
We'll wait here

254
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:09,349
for her summons.

255
00:16:10,548 --> 00:16:11,109
Uncle.

256
00:16:11,628 --> 00:16:12,388
Tell us

257
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,349
about Princess Mengji,

258
00:16:13,748 --> 00:16:14,989
so we don't offend her later.

259
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:18,508
Back then,

260
00:16:18,788 --> 00:16:21,028
the old lord had a son and a daughter.

261
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:24,469
The eldest son died before 18.

262
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:26,709
In those days, the Mengji Mansion

263
00:16:26,748 --> 00:16:28,868
was like a boat in stormy seas.

264
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:31,229
To stabilize the situation, the Princess

265
00:16:31,548 --> 00:16:33,309
married the son
of a high-ranking official.

266
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:34,989
After her husband's death,

267
00:16:35,388 --> 00:16:36,748
she took charge of governance,

268
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:38,189
quelled internal conflicts,

269
00:16:38,668 --> 00:16:39,548
won over the people,

270
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:41,229
and steered

271
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:43,148
Jiyang's slow return to stability.

272
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:47,949
The Princess arrives!

273
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:10,432
(Mu Hongjin, Princess Mengji)

274
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,308
I'm Cui Yuezhi.

275
00:17:12,508 --> 00:17:13,629
Your Highness.

276
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:15,229
Huanqing, Yuyan,

277
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:16,508
greet the Princess.

278
00:17:21,149 --> 00:17:22,149
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

279
00:17:24,748 --> 00:17:25,508
Mr. Cui.

280
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:26,869
These two

281
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:28,669
are your long-lost nephew

282
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:30,389
and niece-in-law?

283
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:32,429
Your Highness,

284
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:33,709
this young man

285
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:35,548
is my nephew, Huanqing.

286
00:17:36,108 --> 00:17:36,909
Beside him

287
00:17:36,949 --> 00:17:38,429
stands this lovely and dutiful lady,

288
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:40,068
his recently wedded wife,

289
00:17:40,149 --> 00:17:40,748
Yuyan.

290
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:43,028
Huanqing

291
00:17:43,268 --> 00:17:45,548
is handsome, clever, and skilled in

292
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:46,949
both civil and martial arts.

293
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:48,709
His demeanor

294
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:51,028
greatly resembles my late elder brother.

295
00:17:51,348 --> 00:17:52,548
Every time I see him,

296
00:17:52,949 --> 00:17:55,949
I'm filled with melancholy.

297
00:17:56,669 --> 00:17:57,989
I never realized

298
00:17:58,508 --> 00:18:00,229
the Right Army Commander had free time

299
00:18:00,828 --> 00:18:02,588
to impersonate someone

300
00:18:03,588 --> 00:18:04,869
to come to my place?

301
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:13,189
You old fool.

302
00:18:13,588 --> 00:18:15,508
Falling for such an obvious deception.

303
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:17,429
He resembles your dead brother?

304
00:18:17,828 --> 00:18:19,229
Have you looked in a mirror?

305
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:21,229
Your family

306
00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:22,989
are never known

307
00:18:23,348 --> 00:18:24,308
for handsomeness.

308
00:18:24,308 --> 00:18:24,928
I...

309
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,748
Please stop

310
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:32,108
beating around the bush.

311
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:34,108
Why did you infiltrate Jiyang City?

312
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:36,588
What's your true purpose?

313
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:38,909
My apologies, Your Highness.

314
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:41,068
My visit here

315
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:42,828
aims to find someone.

316
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:44,828
Chai Anxi,

317
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:46,709
once my father's subordinate,

318
00:18:47,308 --> 00:18:48,788
went missing in the Mingshui Battle.

319
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:51,149
After tracking him all this way,

320
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:52,748
I had no choice

321
00:18:53,229 --> 00:18:54,149
but to hide my identity

322
00:18:54,469 --> 00:18:55,229
to enter Jiyang.

323
00:18:56,308 --> 00:18:58,068
Mr. Cui was kept in the dark.

324
00:18:59,108 --> 00:18:59,748
Your Highness,

325
00:18:59,949 --> 00:19:00,788
please forgive him.

326
00:19:02,149 --> 00:19:03,709
Is that your excuse?

327
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:04,909
Do you know

328
00:19:05,308 --> 00:19:06,189
nowadays, Jiyang

329
00:19:06,828 --> 00:19:08,149
has been infiltrated

330
00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:09,068
by many Wutuo spies?

331
00:19:10,508 --> 00:19:11,429
Is this true?

332
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:13,669
Jiyang City is impenetrable.

333
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:15,429
How did they infiltrate?

334
00:19:16,548 --> 00:19:17,229
Your Highness,

335
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:19,149
as General Xiao mentioned,

336
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:20,068
the Wutuo people

337
00:19:20,229 --> 00:19:21,469
used unknown methods

338
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:22,748
to infiltrate Jiyang City.

339
00:19:23,348 --> 00:19:25,389
They ambushed the little princess

340
00:19:25,828 --> 00:19:26,828
during her outing,

341
00:19:27,229 --> 00:19:27,909
probably

342
00:19:28,108 --> 00:19:29,028
to blackmail you.

343
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:30,788
Please don't worry.

344
00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:32,588
I've deployed people to capture

345
00:19:32,828 --> 00:19:33,828
the Wutuo spies.

346
00:19:34,469 --> 00:19:35,669
Given current circumstances,

347
00:19:36,068 --> 00:19:37,429
merely catching them

348
00:19:37,989 --> 00:19:38,709
won't suffice.

349
00:19:39,189 --> 00:19:40,268
What's your proposal?

350
00:19:40,748 --> 00:19:41,669
As you said,

351
00:19:42,308 --> 00:19:43,469
Jiyang is impenetrable

352
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:44,588
as the world knows.

353
00:19:45,068 --> 00:19:45,748
But now,

354
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:47,709
the Wutuo agents have managed

355
00:19:47,748 --> 00:19:48,989
to infiltrate effortlessly

356
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:50,989
and target the little princess.

357
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:52,348
This proves

358
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:54,389
their actions are premeditated

359
00:19:55,229 --> 00:19:56,308
and well-prepared.

360
00:19:57,949 --> 00:19:58,528
Your Highness,

361
00:19:59,108 --> 00:20:00,869
for Jiyang's citizens' safety,

362
00:20:01,469 --> 00:20:02,788
we must prepare early

363
00:20:03,108 --> 00:20:03,989
and take precautions.

364
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:06,108
This is our business.

365
00:20:07,348 --> 00:20:08,669
We'll handle it ourselves.

366
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:15,429
Your Highness,

367
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:17,429
Military Inspector Chu Zhao is outside.

368
00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:20,909
Let him in.

369
00:20:35,949 --> 00:20:36,629
Your Highness.

370
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:37,989
Skip formalities.

371
00:20:38,588 --> 00:20:40,028
Why would a military inspector

372
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:42,189
visit Jiyang?

373
00:20:42,748 --> 00:20:44,149
Are you sent by the court?

374
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:46,469
You misunderstand.

375
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:47,909
I'm returning to the capital

376
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:49,508
and merely passing through.

377
00:20:51,348 --> 00:20:52,548
Then why request this meeting?

378
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:53,669
I

379
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:56,429
spotted a Wutuo spy.

380
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:06,028
Where?

381
00:21:06,989 --> 00:21:07,869
At an herb shop.

382
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:09,189
A wounded man had

383
00:21:09,588 --> 00:21:10,748
a wolf-head tattoo

384
00:21:11,268 --> 00:21:11,989
on his right arm,

385
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,828
a Wutuo identifier,

386
00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:14,989
revealed during treatment.

387
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:16,709
I tracked him

388
00:21:17,189 --> 00:21:18,748
to a group of Wutuo spies.

389
00:21:19,389 --> 00:21:20,389
There were over a dozen.

390
00:21:22,068 --> 00:21:22,629
Clearly,

391
00:21:23,108 --> 00:21:24,108
multiple Wutuo groups

392
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:24,989
have infiltrated

393
00:21:25,588 --> 00:21:26,389
this city.

394
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:28,989
Please reconsider

395
00:21:29,828 --> 00:21:30,389
my proposal,

396
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:32,788
Your Highness.

397
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:35,149
We appreciate your warning.

398
00:21:35,949 --> 00:21:36,989
But we'll handle

399
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,348
our own affairs.

400
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:40,548
You may leave.

401
00:21:40,828 --> 00:21:42,788
Host them at the mansion tonight.

402
00:21:56,755 --> 00:21:58,899
(Self-Revealing Virtue)

403
00:22:02,508 --> 00:22:03,588
Mr. Qiao?

404
00:22:05,469 --> 00:22:06,788
I didn't expect you in Jiyang

405
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:08,108
under a new name.

406
00:22:09,348 --> 00:22:09,869
There's more.

407
00:22:10,508 --> 00:22:11,508
I've even gotten married.

408
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:14,432
Mr. Chu,

409
00:22:14,949 --> 00:22:15,989
we're destined to meet

410
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,108
wherever we go.

411
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:19,508
Putting it that way,

412
00:22:19,949 --> 00:22:21,788
it seems we're always reuniting.

413
00:22:22,229 --> 00:22:23,669
Then you must be very busy, Mr. Chu.

414
00:22:24,028 --> 00:22:25,068
Even crossing a street

415
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,508
would make you reunite

416
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:27,748
with many 'destined ones'.

417
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:39,429
Commander, night approaches.

418
00:22:39,629 --> 00:22:40,508
Let's dine.

419
00:22:53,588 --> 00:22:55,028
Xiao Jue's arrival was abrupt

420
00:22:55,149 --> 00:22:56,028
and impolite.

421
00:22:56,469 --> 00:22:57,709
But a general of his caliber

422
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:59,028
never acts rashly.

423
00:22:59,548 --> 00:23:00,588
Mobilize defenses,

424
00:23:00,828 --> 00:23:02,429
increase patrols and drills,

425
00:23:02,709 --> 00:23:03,669
and stockpile herbs

426
00:23:03,828 --> 00:23:04,508
just in case.

427
00:23:05,389 --> 00:23:06,548
Understood.

428
00:23:07,068 --> 00:23:07,712
Moreover,

429
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:09,629
he saved Lou.

430
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:11,748
Keep his presence here

431
00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:12,748
confidential.

432
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:14,669
Help his search

433
00:23:15,108 --> 00:23:16,028
for the person.

434
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:18,368
Yes.

435
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:29,920
(Self-Revealing Virtue)

436
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:55,629
Slow Passing Years.

437
00:24:20,588 --> 00:24:21,469
Your Highness.

438
00:24:23,268 --> 00:24:24,108
Slow Passing Years.

439
00:24:25,348 --> 00:24:26,989
Have you heard this song?

440
00:24:28,629 --> 00:24:29,709
My master often plays it.

441
00:24:32,548 --> 00:24:34,709
I heard Lou mention it.

442
00:24:35,229 --> 00:24:35,909
Her savior

443
00:24:36,469 --> 00:24:37,909
also included a white-clad hero

444
00:24:38,469 --> 00:24:39,508
with a sword in hand

445
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:40,949
and a zither on his back.

446
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:43,028
Do you know

447
00:24:43,828 --> 00:24:44,748
who he might be?

448
00:24:46,548 --> 00:24:47,629
That was my master

449
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,989
Liu Buwang, the Cloudforest Hermit.

450
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:54,989
Liu Buwang?

451
00:24:57,508 --> 00:24:58,308
Is he well?

452
00:25:00,748 --> 00:25:01,344
No.

453
00:25:02,348 --> 00:25:03,308
No need to tell me.

454
00:25:04,308 --> 00:25:05,108
I don't care.

455
00:25:09,989 --> 00:25:11,108
May I ask you

456
00:25:11,828 --> 00:25:12,748
if you

457
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:14,548
and my master

458
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:16,909
were once acquainted?

459
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:22,669
(Many years ago,)

460
00:25:23,709 --> 00:25:24,828
(to escape my marriage,)

461
00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:27,348
(I secretly fled the mansion.)

462
00:25:34,588 --> 00:25:35,748
Run faster, little lady!

463
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:37,920
- Try running!
- Where can you flee now?

464
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,308
Help! Is anyone there to save me?

465
00:25:40,548 --> 00:25:41,229
Run!

466
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:42,669
Scream!

467
00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:43,949
Yeah, keep running!

468
00:26:00,828 --> 00:26:01,344
Sir.

469
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:02,869
Help me, sir!

470
00:26:03,508 --> 00:26:04,669
Carrying a zither?

471
00:26:05,469 --> 00:26:06,348
You fragile man

472
00:26:06,389 --> 00:26:07,909
want to be a hero?

473
00:26:08,308 --> 00:26:08,909
Scram.

474
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:10,828
Sir.

475
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:12,508
Still here?

476
00:26:13,149 --> 00:26:13,709
Get him!

477
00:26:29,508 --> 00:26:30,272
Sir.

478
00:26:52,469 --> 00:26:53,348
Thank you.

479
00:26:54,068 --> 00:26:55,068
I'm Mu Hongjin.

480
00:26:55,508 --> 00:26:56,588
What's your name?

481
00:26:59,189 --> 00:26:59,828
Liu Buwang.

482
00:27:00,348 --> 00:27:01,268
If you're unharmed,

483
00:27:01,508 --> 00:27:02,508
I'll take my leave.

484
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:04,748
Mr. Liu.

485
00:27:07,989 --> 00:27:09,588
I think my ankle's sprained.

486
00:27:10,548 --> 00:27:11,389
In for a penny,

487
00:27:11,748 --> 00:27:12,629
in for a pound.

488
00:27:13,308 --> 00:27:13,869
How about

489
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:15,469
you carry me?

490
00:27:15,629 --> 00:27:16,224
No.

491
00:27:17,229 --> 00:27:17,869
That's improper.

492
00:27:21,828 --> 00:27:23,149
It really does hurt

493
00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:24,588
when I move.

494
00:27:27,508 --> 00:27:29,068
Please, sir.

495
00:27:38,348 --> 00:27:38,880
Miss,

496
00:27:39,308 --> 00:27:40,032
where's your home?

497
00:27:40,669 --> 00:27:41,469
I'll take you back.

498
00:27:41,709 --> 00:27:42,629
I have no home.

499
00:27:43,108 --> 00:27:44,469
I was kidnapped and brought here.

500
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:47,068
My home is very far away.

501
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:48,788
I'll follow you.

502
00:27:49,108 --> 00:27:50,508
Wherever you go, I go.

503
00:27:51,068 --> 00:27:52,068
What do you mean

504
00:27:52,068 --> 00:27:52,869
by "follow me"?

505
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:54,669
Why would you follow me?

506
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:56,748
Since you saved me,

507
00:27:57,028 --> 00:27:58,308
see it through to the end.

508
00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:01,268
Or escort me home.

509
00:28:01,788 --> 00:28:02,748
My home is far away.

510
00:28:02,989 --> 00:28:03,669
Can you do it?

511
00:28:03,788 --> 00:28:04,384
Of course.

512
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:07,469
My home's in Yaojing.

513
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,028
Don't worry.

514
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,268
I don't eat much.

515
00:28:13,348 --> 00:28:14,748
I won't cost you much.

516
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:15,669
Having me along

517
00:28:15,788 --> 00:28:16,909
won't be a burden.

518
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:18,508
No.

519
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:22,588
Please, please.

520
00:28:25,548 --> 00:28:26,989
I'm begging you.

521
00:28:49,149 --> 00:28:49,748
Thank you.

522
00:29:45,828 --> 00:29:46,588
I'm starving.

523
00:29:47,108 --> 00:29:47,869
Sir.

524
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:50,189
Can we have a proper meal?

525
00:29:50,828 --> 00:29:51,360
No.

526
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,548
After a month,

527
00:29:52,949 --> 00:29:54,108
my money is nearly gone.

528
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:58,149
Candied haws for sale!

529
00:30:00,108 --> 00:30:00,949
Candied haws.

530
00:30:01,108 --> 00:30:01,709
Want one?

531
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:03,072
Take a look.

532
00:30:07,949 --> 00:30:09,308
Sir, one please.

533
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:10,629
Alright. Thank you.

534
00:30:11,748 --> 00:30:12,508
Here, hold this.

535
00:30:22,068 --> 00:30:23,348
You still care about me.

536
00:30:23,669 --> 00:30:24,229
Want some?

537
00:30:25,348 --> 00:30:25,869
Miss.

538
00:30:26,709 --> 00:30:27,264
Boundaries.

539
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:37,909
Take a bouquet if you like it.

540
00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:38,828
This one, then.

541
00:30:39,108 --> 00:30:39,629
Take care.

542
00:30:44,229 --> 00:30:45,308
This looks nice.

543
00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:49,108
These bracelets
are called Joyful Hearts.

544
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,828
My husband and I

545
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:51,949
carved them together.

546
00:30:52,748 --> 00:30:53,989
Joyful Hearts bracelets.

547
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:55,469
Any special meaning?

548
00:30:55,748 --> 00:30:56,629
If lovers

549
00:30:56,828 --> 00:30:59,108
wear these bracelets,

550
00:30:59,348 --> 00:31:00,709
they'll never be separated.

551
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:04,469
Is this your lover?

552
00:31:05,348 --> 00:31:06,788
Buy a pair for the lady.

553
00:31:07,068 --> 00:31:07,869
A lifetime

554
00:31:08,028 --> 00:31:09,268
of togetherness.

555
00:31:10,189 --> 00:31:11,189
You heard that, Mr. Liu?

556
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:12,748
Buy me one?

557
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:27,548
She's not my lover.

558
00:31:34,788 --> 00:31:36,348
- Great!
- Great!

559
00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:37,229
You sure

560
00:31:37,268 --> 00:31:38,629
I'm not your lover?

561
00:31:44,189 --> 00:31:45,068
No flowers?

562
00:31:46,108 --> 00:31:46,669
No.

563
00:32:00,028 --> 00:32:00,588
It's me.

564
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:13,989
Soldiers are everywhere outside,

565
00:32:14,189 --> 00:32:14,989
checking everyone.

566
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,709
Seemingly searching for someone.

567
00:32:21,748 --> 00:32:22,508
Tomorrow,

568
00:32:23,588 --> 00:32:25,108
I must return to Qiyun Mountain.

569
00:32:26,268 --> 00:32:27,669
Will you come with me?

570
00:32:28,189 --> 00:32:29,308
You'll meet my master.

571
00:32:31,068 --> 00:32:32,229
I can't go with you.

572
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,308
Why?

573
00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:40,189
I'm Prince Mengji's daughter.

574
00:32:41,629 --> 00:32:43,389
The person those soldiers are hunting

575
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:45,308
is me.

576
00:32:46,869 --> 00:32:47,548
My father wants

577
00:32:48,068 --> 00:32:48,669
me to marry

578
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:49,989
a court official's son

579
00:32:50,949 --> 00:32:52,469
to strengthen his political standing.

580
00:32:53,709 --> 00:32:54,229
I refused.

581
00:32:54,268 --> 00:32:55,229
That's why I fled.

582
00:32:55,788 --> 00:32:57,229
But then I met you.

583
00:32:58,429 --> 00:32:59,508
This past month

584
00:33:00,508 --> 00:33:02,189
has been truly joyful.

585
00:33:05,949 --> 00:33:06,669
Mr. Liu,

586
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:08,748
I don't want that marriage.

587
00:33:10,268 --> 00:33:11,909
But I can't go up the mountain with you.

588
00:33:12,828 --> 00:33:13,788
What should I do?

589
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:18,588
In that case,

590
00:33:19,229 --> 00:33:20,588
wait here at this inn.

591
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:21,909
I'll go

592
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:23,469
tell my master

593
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:25,028
and then return in two days.

594
00:33:25,348 --> 00:33:26,548
We'll resolve this together.

595
00:33:28,588 --> 00:33:29,748
Must you leave now?

596
00:33:30,588 --> 00:33:31,508
I'll definitely return.

597
00:33:32,268 --> 00:33:32,828
Liu Buwang,

598
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:36,229
remember your promise.

599
00:33:37,989 --> 00:33:39,028
You must come back.

600
00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:44,548

if I ever meant anything to him,

617
00:35:20,389 --> 00:35:21,789
but the answer never came.

618
00:35:22,749 --> 00:35:23,789
Deep down, I know

619
00:35:24,668 --> 00:35:25,389
we are

620
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:26,429
in separate worlds.

621

What a pity.

629
00:35:45,789 --> 00:35:47,508
He remains a coward.

630
00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:49,909
Not even brave enough to end things

631
00:35:49,909 --> 00:35:50,429
properly.

632
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,269
My master isn't like that.
