Come on.

24
00:01:45,915 --> 00:01:46,755
Thank you.

25
00:01:47,594 --> 00:01:48,434
Thank you.

26
00:01:49,314 --> 00:01:50,154
Take your time.

27
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,275
(This is)

28
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:52,635
(tragic reality in this city.)

29
00:01:53,554 --> 00:01:54,394
(It seems we must)

30
00:01:54,394 --> 00:01:55,594
(think of an idea quickly)

31
00:01:55,995 --> 00:01:56,835
(to repel the Wutuo.)

32
00:01:56,835 --> 00:01:57,675
Is this enough?

33
00:01:59,195 --> 00:02:00,035
General Wu'an,

34
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:01,635
the congee is shared.

35
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:03,595
By the way, Ms. Qi Luo,

36
00:02:04,394 --> 00:02:05,355
didn't we send people

37
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:07,355
to inform their families
to pick them up?

38
00:02:07,635 --> 00:02:09,714
Why hasn't anyone returned home?

39
00:02:09,954 --> 00:02:11,035
They were abducted

40
00:02:11,635 --> 00:02:12,514
and violated.

41
00:02:13,155 --> 00:02:15,274
Their families think they're a disgrace,

42
00:02:16,274 --> 00:02:17,514
refusing to take them back.

43
00:02:18,954 --> 00:02:20,794
This calamity wasn't their choice.

44
00:02:21,554 --> 00:02:23,075
They've narrowly escaped death,

45
00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:24,755
but their families bar the door.

46
00:02:25,554 --> 00:02:26,875
How ridiculous.

47
00:02:27,475 --> 00:02:28,755
If they were men,

48
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:30,435
they'd already be home

49
00:02:30,755 --> 00:02:31,954
with their families.

50
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:34,794
Maybe even praised as heroes.

51
00:02:35,595 --> 00:02:36,915
How could that be heroic?

52
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:38,155
True heroes like you.

53
00:02:38,432 --> 00:02:39,635
Protecting homes and citizens.

54
00:02:40,114 --> 00:02:40,994
That's real heroism.

55
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:42,915
And my master.

56
00:02:43,234 --> 00:02:44,274
You two

57
00:02:44,274 --> 00:02:46,554
are both great heroes
defending Wei's people.

58
00:02:49,114 --> 00:02:50,595
I won't claim to be a hero.

59
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:52,195
As for Li Kuang,

60
00:02:53,504 --> 00:02:55,035
heroes don't follow the crowd

61
00:02:55,435 --> 00:02:58,435
or push suffering people
deeper into despair.

62
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:00,475
Nor would they save rations

63
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,514
by starving those they should protect.

64
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:06,114
Are you blaming my master?

65
00:03:06,674 --> 00:03:08,394
He has his difficulties.

66
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,234
The city's food reserves are low.

67
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:11,755
He's deeply concerned.

68
00:03:11,954 --> 00:03:12,794
So...

69
00:03:14,155 --> 00:03:14,995
Ms. Qi Luo,

70
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:15,995
are you alright?

71
00:03:16,514 --> 00:03:17,514
I have some ointment.

72
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:18,595
I'll get it for you.

73
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:20,875
These minor injuries are nothing.

74
00:03:21,315 --> 00:03:22,355
Don't blame my master.

75
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:24,195
He's actually kind-hearted.

76
00:03:24,994 --> 00:03:26,755
He saved me from street thugs

77
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:28,274
and gave me food

78
00:03:28,994 --> 00:03:30,755
and shelter.

79
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:32,075
Ms. Qi Luo,

80
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:34,195
is this what 'good' means?

81
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:35,715
He married you.

82
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:37,755
Shouldn't he care for you?

83
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:39,674
In these chaotic times,

84
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:40,915
as a woman,

85
00:03:41,435 --> 00:03:42,394
I belong to him.

86
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:44,915
It's my duty to serve him well,

87
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,155
respect him, obey him,

88
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,674
and make him my universe.

89
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:49,715
Slow down.

90
00:03:50,114 --> 00:03:50,954
Be careful.

91
00:03:52,475 --> 00:03:53,315
Is this better?

92
00:03:58,475 --> 00:03:59,315
Master.

93
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,075
I'm scared.

94
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:03,075
I don't want to go.

95
00:04:04,114 --> 00:04:05,794
I only want to stay with you.

96
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,755
I don't want to be anyone's example.

97
00:04:10,155 --> 00:04:12,034
Rundu must not fall to Wutuo.

98
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:14,354
As Rundu's defender,

99
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:17,315
I'll protect it even
at the cost of my life.

100
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:20,354
But with our current forces,

101
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,834
we stand no chance.

102
00:04:22,154 --> 00:04:23,235
We must burn our boats

103
00:04:23,354 --> 00:04:24,194
and fight them

104
00:04:24,195 --> 00:04:25,115
to the bitter end!

105
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:27,994
You and those female captives
are vanguards.

106
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:30,154
After you distract the Wutuo forces,

107
00:04:31,034 --> 00:04:32,235
I'll lead the army to battle

108
00:04:32,914 --> 00:04:34,235
and die defending Rundu.

109
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:46,315
I understand now.

110
00:04:52,354 --> 00:04:53,514
I'll go.

111
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:57,555
Please take care.

112
00:05:00,755 --> 00:05:02,154
He, He.

113
00:05:04,155 --> 00:05:05,834
Mai and I heard something

114
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:06,674
on our way here.

115
00:05:06,994 --> 00:05:07,834
Li Kuang

116
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:09,248
plans to send the women we rescued

117
00:05:09,248 --> 00:05:10,795
to the battlefield

118
00:05:10,795 --> 00:05:11,875
to fight the enemies!

119
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,514
He's sending them to die!

120
00:05:19,954 --> 00:05:20,794
Let's go.

121
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:41,154
Tainted by the enemy.

122
00:05:42,034 --> 00:05:43,154
Disgrace to the family.

123
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:45,834
Not worthy to live.

124
00:05:47,474 --> 00:05:48,394
Not worthy to live.

125
00:05:58,034 --> 00:05:58,874
Mr. Wang,

126
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:00,474
as the Military Director,

127
00:06:00,914 --> 00:06:02,154
I can command you.

128
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:03,874
By my order,

129
00:06:04,235 --> 00:06:05,075
do not open the gate.

130
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:07,635
Mr. Chu.

131
00:06:07,995 --> 00:06:09,435
All hangs on this move.

132
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,115
But I serve Rundu's garrison.

133
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:14,394
We only obey Commander Li's orders.

134
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:16,794
Open the gate.

135
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:19,835
Mr. Wang!

136
00:06:24,274 --> 00:06:25,354
Open the gate!

137
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:04,795
Let me see who will open it!

138
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:06,755
This is Rundu.

139
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:09,034
I'm General Wu'an
appointed by His Majesty.

140
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:10,914
Not under your jurisdiction.

141
00:07:12,674 --> 00:07:14,354
I'm not your soldier.

142
00:07:24,514 --> 00:07:25,354
Lure the enemy?

143
00:07:26,034 --> 00:07:26,874
Commander Li.

144
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:28,394
You're just sacrificing lives.

145
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:30,035
General Wu'an.

146
00:07:30,354 --> 00:07:31,635
Your contributions to Rundu

147
00:07:31,954 --> 00:07:33,235
are deeply appreciated.

148
00:07:33,755 --> 00:07:34,635
But even so,

149
00:07:34,795 --> 00:07:36,595
you can't interfere in
our military affairs.

150
00:07:37,435 --> 00:07:39,315
If you overstep again,

151
00:07:39,755 --> 00:07:40,595
just leave Rundu.

152
00:07:40,754 --> 00:07:42,434
You're the one who should leave!

153
00:07:44,995 --> 00:07:45,875
Please calm down.

154
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:49,675
Don't blame Commander Li.

155
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:51,234
We

156
00:07:51,675 --> 00:07:52,594
volunteered.

157
00:07:53,795 --> 00:07:54,635
We are

158
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:56,274
defiled.

159
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:58,635
No dignity to keep living.

160
00:08:00,235 --> 00:08:01,435
If our deaths

161
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:03,514
can gain Rundu an advantage,

162
00:08:03,795 --> 00:08:05,834
we'll cleanse our shame

163
00:08:06,315 --> 00:08:07,594
and die with honor.

164
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:09,954
Commander Li
entrusted us with this task.

165
00:08:10,354 --> 00:08:11,514
He's giving us chances.

166
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:13,715
If we can

167
00:08:14,274 --> 00:08:15,474
deceive the Wutuo enemies

168
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:16,755
and make them believe

169
00:08:16,755 --> 00:08:17,995
Rundu has no fighters left,

170
00:08:18,474 --> 00:08:20,115
we'll gain an advantage

171
00:08:20,514 --> 00:08:21,354
and strike them

172
00:08:21,354 --> 00:08:22,474
unprepared at the showdown.

173
00:08:22,914 --> 00:08:23,754
Chances?

174
00:08:24,315 --> 00:08:25,795
So I'm blocking your way to merit?

175
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,474
Yes.

176
00:08:31,195 --> 00:08:32,114
In crisis,

177
00:08:32,915 --> 00:08:34,435
we should unite

178
00:08:34,634 --> 00:08:35,555
against foes.

179
00:08:35,754 --> 00:08:38,035
But not by sending you
to die pointlessly.

180
00:08:38,515 --> 00:08:39,675
This isn't courage.

181
00:08:40,114 --> 00:08:40,994
This is foolishness.

182
00:08:41,435 --> 00:08:42,354
Watch your words!

183
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:44,995
Li Kuang,

184
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:46,834
as Rundu's commander,

185
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,435
you point blades
at your women and people.

186
00:08:51,075 --> 00:08:51,915
What's this?

187
00:08:52,634 --> 00:08:53,634
They volunteered.

188
00:08:54,515 --> 00:08:55,555
Their sortie

189
00:08:55,594 --> 00:08:57,355
is to deceive the enemy and buy time.

190
00:08:57,994 --> 00:09:00,435
As the Rundu commander,
I'll lead the charge

191
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:02,834
and fight to the death
defending this city.

192
00:09:03,474 --> 00:09:04,874
Better die meaningfully

193
00:09:05,275 --> 00:09:06,354
than live in shame.

194
00:09:08,075 --> 00:09:08,915
Volunteered?

195
00:09:11,114 --> 00:09:11,954
Let me ask you.

196
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:14,594
Are you truly willing?

197
00:09:19,395 --> 00:09:20,874
I... I...

198
00:09:21,555 --> 00:09:22,834
I don't want to die.

199
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,954
I want to live with dignity.

200
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:31,195
You shouldn't feel ashamed.

201
00:09:31,874 --> 00:09:32,915
Shame belongs to

202
00:09:33,395 --> 00:09:34,634
Commander Li.

203
00:09:39,155 --> 00:09:39,995
Li Kuang.

204
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:41,275
Did they volunteer

205
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,675
or were they forced to do this?

206
00:09:44,315 --> 00:09:45,634
You know the truth.

207
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:48,435
Aren't they Rundu's citizens?

208
00:09:49,795 --> 00:09:51,035
As the city's commander,

209
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:52,395
you make

210
00:09:52,395 --> 00:09:54,634
those you should protect die needlessly.

211
00:09:57,114 --> 00:09:57,954
Swords

212
00:09:58,795 --> 00:10:00,155
are for enemies.

213
00:10:00,994 --> 00:10:02,754
Never against the weak.

214
00:10:05,315 --> 00:10:06,155
Yes.

215
00:10:09,114 --> 00:10:10,354
Never against the weak.

216
00:10:19,795 --> 00:10:20,635
Commander.

217
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:30,315
You haven't changed.

218
00:10:31,395 --> 00:10:32,315
General Zhang

219
00:10:32,954 --> 00:10:34,915
used a few citizens as bait.

220
00:10:35,954 --> 00:10:37,275
It lacked compassion.

221
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:39,714
But compared to losing the city,

222
00:10:40,195 --> 00:10:43,594
it was minor.

223
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:47,195
So, in a crisis, we must
make such a trade-off.

224
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:50,275
Sir,

225
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:52,075
but I hold a different view.

226
00:10:52,915 --> 00:10:54,395
I understand General Zhang.

227
00:10:54,795 --> 00:10:55,915
But if it were me,

228
00:10:56,594 --> 00:10:57,714
I would never act this way.

229
00:10:58,275 --> 00:10:59,834
I'd lead the remaining soldiers

230
00:11:00,195 --> 00:11:01,035
to fight the rebels

231
00:11:01,435 --> 00:11:02,915
at the city gates.

232
00:11:03,915 --> 00:11:05,234
The one who wields the sword

233
00:11:05,634 --> 00:11:06,474
must know

234
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,874
whether the blade is meant

235
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:11,315
for the enemy in front

236
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:13,435
or the weak behind them.

237
00:11:16,354 --> 00:11:18,195
I will never draw
my sword against the weak.

238
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:34,555
C-C-Commander Xiao's here? How?

239
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:36,954
Do you think

240
00:11:37,394 --> 00:11:38,234
it's because of...?

241
00:11:38,234 --> 00:11:39,994
Because of our absence from camp,

242
00:11:40,474 --> 00:11:41,314
he came to punish us?

243
00:11:42,714 --> 00:11:44,795
No, that can't be it.

244
00:11:45,315 --> 00:11:46,474
He seems in good spirits.

245
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:48,075
He even smiled.

246
00:11:49,234 --> 00:11:50,074
Really?

247
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:51,234
Absolutely true.

248
00:11:51,874 --> 00:11:55,395
D-D-Don't worry.

249
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:56,994
S-S-Stop mocking me.

250
00:11:58,474 --> 00:11:59,314
General Fengyun,

251
00:11:59,795 --> 00:12:00,635
how did you get in?

252
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:02,155
I fought my way through

253
00:12:02,714 --> 00:12:03,675
with my battalion.

254
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:06,714
Commander Xiao, it must be hard work.

255
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:10,635
Commander Li,

256
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:13,354
General Wu'an is my man.

257
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:15,675
My soldiers' discipline

258
00:12:16,354 --> 00:12:17,435
is my own responsibility.

259
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:19,354
No outsiders may interfere.

260
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:21,195
Besides,

261
00:12:22,395 --> 00:12:23,235
he wasn't wrong.

262
00:12:27,275 --> 00:12:29,675
I know I'm the one at fault.

263
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:31,515
But I'm ready to die defending Rundu.

264
00:12:31,555 --> 00:12:32,634
Already thinking of defeat?

265
00:12:32,994 --> 00:12:35,075
Rundu needs
no cowardly commanders like you.

266
00:12:42,315 --> 00:12:43,474
Warriors fear not death

267
00:12:44,474 --> 00:12:45,994
but wield swords to protect our land

268
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:47,915
and our people.

269
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:57,314
Soldiers!

270
00:12:57,634 --> 00:12:58,515
Both we and the Wutuo

271
00:12:58,915 --> 00:12:59,795
lack supplies.

272
00:13:00,354 --> 00:13:01,714
This is a do-or-die battle.

273
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:04,474
The brave will win.

274
00:13:05,114 --> 00:13:05,954
Besides,

275
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,515
General Fengyun's reinforcements
have arrived.

276
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:12,354
Director Chu of the Ministry of War

277
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:14,195
has brought us provisions.

278
00:13:15,354 --> 00:13:18,395
Millions of Wei citizens
stand behind us.

279
00:13:19,195 --> 00:13:20,234
As warriors,

280
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:22,555
we raise swords to protect our land

281
00:13:22,795 --> 00:13:23,714
and our people!

282
00:13:24,754 --> 00:13:25,594
Soldiers!

283
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:27,075
Will you join me

284
00:13:27,714 --> 00:13:30,035
to fight the enemy outside, repel Wutuo,

285
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:31,634
and defend Rundu

286
00:13:32,275 --> 00:13:33,435
and Wei?

287
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:34,754
- Yes!
- Yes!

288
00:13:35,594 --> 00:13:36,434
General Fengyun

289
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:38,754
and General Wu'an stand with Rundu.

290
00:13:39,395 --> 00:13:40,235
This battle,

291
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:41,754
we will win!

292
00:13:42,515 --> 00:13:46,655
- Win!
- Win!

293
00:13:46,655 --> 00:13:50,795
- Win!
- Win!

294
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:20,834
The wind's here.

295
00:14:24,315 --> 00:14:25,155
Smoke out!

296
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:29,696
(Rundu City)

297
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:52,315
What?

298
00:14:52,315 --> 00:14:53,195
What's all this smoke?

299
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:54,115
Yeah.

300
00:14:54,354 --> 00:14:55,194
Such dense smoke.

301
00:15:04,954 --> 00:15:06,035
Commander, please...

302
00:15:06,915 --> 00:15:07,755
Hear that?

303
00:15:17,994 --> 00:15:18,834
Arrows approaching.

304
00:15:34,354 --> 00:15:35,515
A mere smokescreen.

305
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:36,875
Nothing to fear.

306
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:38,115
Archers, ready.

307
00:16:22,075 --> 00:16:22,915
Charge!

308
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:49,194
Capture their leader first.

309
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:05,515
(They fight with no retreat.)

310
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:07,515
(So I'm their true target.)

311
00:18:08,914 --> 00:18:09,995
All troops, heed orders!

312
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:11,715
Defend the headquarters!

313
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:13,715
Let their blood

314
00:18:13,995 --> 00:18:15,194
consecrate our banners!

315
00:18:17,035 --> 00:18:18,235
Defend the headquarters!

316
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,355
Charge!

317
00:18:20,715 --> 00:18:21,995
- Charge!
- Charge!

318
00:19:00,914 --> 00:19:01,955
Sacrificing your own man.

319
00:19:02,114 --> 00:19:03,075
How heartless.

320
00:19:03,555 --> 00:19:04,395
Dying for me

321
00:19:04,634 --> 00:19:05,555
is their noblest end.

322
00:19:52,874 --> 00:19:54,114
Comrades who stand together

323
00:19:54,715 --> 00:19:55,995
make true commanders.

324
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:06,994
Xiao Jue!

325
00:20:21,674 --> 00:20:22,515
Xiao Jue!

326
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:29,674
Xiao Jue!

327
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:38,994
Xiao Jue.

328
00:20:39,995 --> 00:20:40,835
Xiao Jue.

329
00:21:11,114 --> 00:21:12,354
Xiao Jue.

330
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:32,194
Xiao Jue!

331
00:21:52,434 --> 00:21:54,035
Xiao Jue.

Go to ask Yan He

350
00:24:12,555 --> 00:24:13,395
for reinforcements.

351
00:24:14,114 --> 00:24:14,954
The journey's long.

352
00:24:15,075 --> 00:24:15,915
Ride at full speed.

353
00:24:16,275 --> 00:24:17,115
Depart immediately.

354
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:18,034
Yes.

355
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,059
(Yan)

356
00:24:21,755 --> 00:24:22,595
Xiao Huaijin.

357
00:24:40,235 --> 00:24:41,315
The supplies have arrived.

358
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:42,914
Yingxiang and Ms. Qi Luo

359
00:24:43,194 --> 00:24:45,154
are making congee
with the rescued women.

360
00:24:45,154 --> 00:24:46,995
Thanks to your foresight, Mr. Chu.

361
00:24:47,354 --> 00:24:48,755
Before coming, you had Yingxiang

362
00:24:48,795 --> 00:24:49,674
gather provisions.

363
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:52,555
I don't deserve such praise.

364
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,275
My part was small.

365
00:24:54,755 --> 00:24:55,715
We brought in the grain

366
00:24:55,914 --> 00:24:56,914
after the battle ended.

367
00:24:57,755 --> 00:24:58,834
Thank you, Commander Xiao.

368
00:24:59,475 --> 00:25:00,434
You led reinforcements

369
00:25:00,755 --> 00:25:01,955
and summoned General Yan He.

370
00:25:02,995 --> 00:25:03,874
It's my duty.

371
00:25:04,315 --> 00:25:05,594
No thanks needed, Mr. Chu.

372
00:25:05,914 --> 00:25:06,754
Everyone.

373
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:09,955
Rundu survived this crisis

374
00:25:10,194 --> 00:25:11,434
through your assistance.

375
00:25:12,235 --> 00:25:13,955
On behalf of all in Rundu,

376
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:15,115
let me say thank you.

377
00:25:18,394 --> 00:25:19,275
Don't mention it.

378
00:25:19,995 --> 00:25:20,835
Protecting civilians

379
00:25:21,075 --> 00:25:22,035
is our duty.

380
00:25:22,475 --> 00:25:23,354
Aiding each other

381
00:25:23,715 --> 00:25:24,555
is our obligation.

382
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:26,115
No thanks required.

383
00:25:27,114 --> 00:25:27,954
Yeah.

384
00:25:28,075 --> 00:25:28,915
Duty.

385
00:25:29,475 --> 00:25:30,315
Obligation.

386
00:25:30,755 --> 00:25:31,834
But some people...

387
00:25:42,235 --> 00:25:43,075
General Wu'an,

388
00:25:43,395 --> 00:25:44,235
you remind me

389
00:25:44,235 --> 00:25:45,235
of my friend.

390
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:51,035
No, the person he used to be.

391
00:26:03,515 --> 00:26:04,355
Don't tell me

392
00:26:04,715 --> 00:26:06,955
he thinks you resemble He Rufei.

393
00:26:08,795 --> 00:26:09,874
What's wrong with him?

394
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:11,874
You're much better than He Rufei.

395
00:26:12,755 --> 00:26:13,595
How about

396
00:26:13,874 --> 00:26:14,715
you leave Xiao Jue

397
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:16,434
and join my command?

398
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:25,555
Yan He.

399
00:26:25,955 --> 00:26:26,795
So eager

400
00:26:27,154 --> 00:26:28,394
to poach him?

401
00:26:29,114 --> 00:26:30,914
Shouldn't you ask me first?

402
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:32,555
Cold Xiao,

403
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:33,834
why so stingy?

404
00:26:35,154 --> 00:26:35,994
Commander Xiao.

405
00:26:36,715 --> 00:26:37,555
Mr. He

406
00:26:37,795 --> 00:26:38,995
is now General Wu'an.

407
00:26:39,555 --> 00:26:40,434
Where he wants to go

408
00:26:41,955 --> 00:26:42,795
isn't your decision.

409
00:26:47,394 --> 00:26:49,114
Of course it's not my decision.

410
00:26:53,715 --> 00:26:54,555
Where he goes,

411
00:26:55,434 --> 00:26:56,274
what he does,

412
00:26:57,394 --> 00:26:58,475
it's all his choice.

413
00:27:31,515 --> 00:27:32,355
Commander.

414
00:27:34,594 --> 00:27:35,434
Commander,

415
00:27:35,594 --> 00:27:36,555
I was going to see you.

416
00:27:37,315 --> 00:27:38,354
Leaving Yezhou Garrison

417
00:27:38,475 --> 00:27:39,634
was my decision alone.

418
00:27:40,154 --> 00:27:41,275
Wang Ba and Huang Xiong

419
00:27:41,674 --> 00:27:42,715
were forced by me.

420
00:27:43,354 --> 00:27:44,594
Please don't punish them.

421
00:27:45,194 --> 00:27:46,035
All blame

422
00:27:46,555 --> 00:27:47,795
should fall on me alone.

423
00:27:49,475 --> 00:27:50,315
Is that all?

424
00:27:50,914 --> 00:27:51,754
Yes.

425
00:27:55,194 --> 00:27:56,034
Follow me.

426
00:28:30,795 --> 00:28:31,635
Commander.

427
00:28:32,434 --> 00:28:33,274
What's this about?

428
00:28:35,035 --> 00:28:36,154
Before resolving the matter,

429
00:28:37,354 --> 00:28:38,475
you left a letter

430
00:28:39,275 --> 00:28:41,235
and a pouch and then disappeared.

431
00:28:42,235 --> 00:28:43,075
What's that about?

432
00:28:48,035 --> 00:28:48,875
What?

433
00:28:49,275 --> 00:28:50,354
You left something else?

434
00:28:52,114 --> 00:28:52,954
Nothing else.

435
00:28:54,634 --> 00:28:55,674
I left the letter

436
00:28:56,275 --> 00:28:57,115
because

437
00:28:57,475 --> 00:28:58,874
I've earned the general title,

438
00:28:59,515 --> 00:29:00,634
but I'm still your soldier.

439
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:02,194
I left without orders,

440
00:29:02,515 --> 00:29:03,594
and I must tell you why.

441
00:29:04,154 --> 00:29:05,475
As for this pouch,

442
00:29:07,674 --> 00:29:08,755
I took the Qinglang Sword

443
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:10,354
without permission.

444
00:29:10,955 --> 00:29:12,954
This pouch serves as my apology.

445
00:29:27,275 --> 00:29:28,115
He Yan,

446
00:29:28,674 --> 00:29:30,194
my judgment was clouded,

447
00:29:30,995 --> 00:29:32,394
and I couldn't move past it,

448
00:29:33,075 --> 00:29:33,915
so I mistakenly

449
00:29:34,235 --> 00:29:36,874
equated you with that scheming wretch,

450
00:29:37,515 --> 00:29:38,434
He Rufei.

451
00:29:40,315 --> 00:29:41,235
I should've known it.

452
00:29:41,674 --> 00:29:43,954
You are just you.

453
00:29:44,634 --> 00:29:45,515
You've always been

454
00:29:46,275 --> 00:29:47,634
my tenacious classmate

455
00:29:48,674 --> 00:29:50,154
with unwavering integrity,

456
00:29:52,634 --> 00:29:54,114
the general who defended our borders

457
00:29:55,715 --> 00:29:57,434
without hesitation
even in mortal danger.

458
00:30:00,515 --> 00:30:01,674
After returning from Peidu,

459
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:03,674
I wanted to apologize

460
00:30:04,874 --> 00:30:06,394
and clarify everything

461
00:30:08,154 --> 00:30:09,114
and then accompany you

462
00:30:10,035 --> 00:30:11,075
to reinforce Rundu.

463
00:30:12,475 --> 00:30:13,315
But by then,

464
00:30:14,194 --> 00:30:15,594
you had left Yezhou Garrison.

465
00:30:17,594 --> 00:30:18,434
I thought

466
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,475
you must have gone to Rundu.

467
00:30:24,315 --> 00:30:25,354
While in Chonghuai,

468
00:30:26,514 --> 00:30:28,434
I considered confessing
everything to you.

469
00:30:29,434 --> 00:30:31,075
But while I was still hesitating,

470
00:30:31,594 --> 00:30:32,834
you uncovered it yourself.

471
00:30:34,594 --> 00:30:35,434
He Yan,

472
00:30:36,512 --> 00:30:38,715
no matter what storms lie ahead,

473
00:30:41,315 --> 00:30:42,394
I will always trust you

474
00:30:44,795 --> 00:30:45,755
and stand with you

475
00:30:47,475 --> 00:30:48,555
to overcome hardship.

476
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:53,474
Good.

477
00:30:55,634 --> 00:30:56,474
Long time no see,

478
00:30:57,594 --> 00:30:58,434
Commander Xiao.

479
00:31:03,755 --> 00:31:04,595
It's been a while,

480
00:31:06,515 --> 00:31:07,355
General He.

481
00:31:21,114 --> 00:31:22,475
Miss... Miss He,

482
00:31:22,995 --> 00:31:24,394
my temper was terrible,

483
00:31:24,755 --> 00:31:25,834
and I was hostile to you.

484
00:31:26,195 --> 00:31:28,434
The Commander had me
look into He Rufei in the capital.

485
00:31:28,994 --> 00:31:30,715
Then I realized I'd wronged you.

486
00:31:31,955 --> 00:31:32,795
Please forgive me.

487
00:31:33,834 --> 00:31:34,674
It's understandable.

488
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:36,194
I bear no grudge.

489
00:31:36,914 --> 00:31:37,754
Besides,

490
00:31:38,434 --> 00:31:39,275
didn't the Commander

491
00:31:39,594 --> 00:31:41,715
give me the cold shoulder for days?

492
00:31:45,475 --> 00:31:47,674
You're magnanimous, Miss He.

493
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:50,115
Please forgive me.

494
00:31:53,154 --> 00:31:54,475
I'm generous,

495
00:31:55,075 --> 00:31:56,315
so you're forgiven.

496
00:32:02,434 --> 00:32:03,594
But as for some matters,

497
00:32:04,995 --> 00:32:06,555
I can never overlook them.

498
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:11,075
I must personally expose
He Rufei's hypocrisy

499
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,154
and ensure both he and Xu Jingfu

500
00:32:13,555 --> 00:32:14,874
face proper justice.

501
00:32:15,515 --> 00:32:16,634
Following your orders,

502
00:32:17,154 --> 00:32:19,034
I investigated the Huayuan Battle.

503
00:32:19,034 --> 00:32:21,235
The seven generals
initially divided into

504
00:32:21,515 --> 00:32:22,555
three groups as planned

505
00:32:23,035 --> 00:32:25,154
to support He Rufei who was
against Wutuo's main army.

506
00:32:25,794 --> 00:32:26,634
But en route,

507
00:32:26,634 --> 00:32:27,995
they all fell into Wutuo ambushes.

508
00:32:28,475 --> 00:32:29,475
All seven perished.

509
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:31,275
Then He Rufei avenged them

510
00:32:31,755 --> 00:32:33,075
by crushing the Wutuo forces

511
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:34,674
and driving them from Huayuan.

512
00:32:34,674 --> 00:32:35,874
This reeks of deception.

513
00:32:37,194 --> 00:32:38,874
Three separate groups

514
00:32:39,154 --> 00:32:40,795
were all ambushed?

515
00:32:41,035 --> 00:32:42,154
No survivors?

516
00:32:42,834 --> 00:32:44,874
He Rufei alone

517
00:32:45,194 --> 00:32:46,235
emerged victorious,

518
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:47,514
repelling

519
00:32:47,515 --> 00:32:48,914
the formidable Wutuo army?

520
00:32:50,475 --> 00:32:51,475
He Rufei

521
00:32:51,834 --> 00:32:54,315
schemed to conceal his true identity.

522
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:56,035
He teamed up with Wutuo again

523
00:32:56,434 --> 00:32:57,354
and set the ambush

524
00:32:57,874 --> 00:32:58,914
to kill them indirectly.

525
00:32:59,434 --> 00:33:01,035
Suspecting your survival,

526
00:33:01,914 --> 00:33:03,594
he first used the Wutuo forces to kill

527
00:33:04,235 --> 00:33:05,475
the Seven Tiger Generals.

528
00:33:06,075 --> 00:33:07,594
Then he dangled Li Kuang of Rundu

529
00:33:08,035 --> 00:33:08,875
as bait for you.

530
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:10,795
If you rescued Li Kuang,

531
00:33:11,515 --> 00:33:12,755
you'd walk into his trap.

532
00:33:13,434 --> 00:33:14,795
He'd repeat his old tactics,

533
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:17,275
using Wutuo to eliminate you.

534
00:33:18,515 --> 00:33:19,515
Before coming to Rundu,

535
00:33:20,115 --> 00:33:22,475
I knew this was his scheme.

536
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:25,895
But whether for my past comrade

537
00:33:25,895 --> 00:33:27,755
or the people of Rundu,

538
00:33:28,315 --> 00:33:29,315
I had to come.

539
00:33:31,914 --> 00:33:32,995
He Rufei prides himself

540
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:35,354
on manipulating people's minds.

541
00:33:36,394 --> 00:33:38,595
But he never anticipated

542
00:33:39,755 --> 00:33:42,154
that you would risk being charged again

543
00:33:42,874 --> 00:33:44,154
to reinforce Rundu.

544
00:33:48,154 --> 00:33:48,994
By the way,

545
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,434
could you ask Li Kuang

546
00:33:50,594 --> 00:33:52,834
to draft a reinforcement request
for you and Yan He

547
00:33:53,475 --> 00:33:55,275
to prevent those with ulterior motives

548
00:33:56,275 --> 00:33:57,394
from twisting the situation?

549
00:34:00,154 --> 00:34:01,674
By wearing that mask this time,

550
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:04,674
you've terrified the Wutuo forces.

551
00:34:05,395 --> 00:34:06,915
He Rufei will certainly use this

552
00:34:07,234 --> 00:34:08,355
to confirm your identity.

553
00:34:11,234 --> 00:34:12,395
Since I've come to Rundu,

554
00:34:12,794 --> 00:34:13,995
I'm not afraid of him knowing.

555
00:34:15,274 --> 00:34:16,114
When I return,

556
00:34:17,075 --> 00:34:19,634
I'll stand before him
with my head held high.

557
00:34:20,754 --> 00:34:21,875
I'll make sure he learns

558
00:34:24,114 --> 00:34:26,955
who the real General Feihong is.

559
00:34:30,355 --> 00:34:31,314
Speaking of which,

560
00:34:32,515 --> 00:34:34,035
since He Rufei and Xu Jingfu

561
00:34:34,274 --> 00:34:35,594
have been colluding for so long,

562
00:34:35,955 --> 00:34:36,835
there must be evidence

563
00:34:37,234 --> 00:34:38,515
of their collaboration.

564
00:34:39,075 --> 00:34:39,955
And that evidence

565
00:34:40,435 --> 00:34:41,314
is in the capital.

566
00:34:41,794 --> 00:34:43,194
So I want to return sooner

567
00:34:43,435 --> 00:34:45,314
to investigate potential leads.

568
00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:48,515
Good. I'll go with you.
