But I promise you.

Soon,

25
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:44,244
you'll be more regretful.

26
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:49,244
Rufei.

27
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:51,004
Don't think

28
00:01:51,884 --> 00:01:53,004
becoming Marquis Wu'an

29
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:54,685
makes you invincible.

30
00:01:55,804 --> 00:01:57,444
I killed you once,

31
00:01:58,045 --> 00:02:00,325
and I can kill you again.

32
00:02:07,644 --> 00:02:09,005
Killing trash like you

33
00:02:09,124 --> 00:02:10,644
isn't worth dirtying my sword.

34
00:02:11,084 --> 00:02:12,605
S-Stop...

35
00:02:15,524 --> 00:02:16,205
Since childhood,

36
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:17,445
I've shouldered

37
00:02:17,524 --> 00:02:19,084
the family heir's responsibilities.

38
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:20,445
I earned glory

39
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:22,244
and the title of General Feihong

40
00:02:22,804 --> 00:02:24,285
to bring glory to our family,

41
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:25,725
but I never imagined

42
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:26,925
I'd nearly die

43
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:29,205
by my own brother's hand.

44
00:02:32,045 --> 00:02:32,725
Master He,

45
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,124
when you heard of He Yan's death,

46
00:02:35,524 --> 00:02:36,964
what did you feel?

47
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:38,644
Bitter tears of grief

48
00:02:39,084 --> 00:02:40,564
or a wave of relief?

49
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:42,964
This is

50
00:02:43,244 --> 00:02:44,605
our mansion.

51
00:02:45,244 --> 00:02:47,804
How dare you act recklessly here!

52
00:02:50,165 --> 00:02:51,445
Since you said so,

53
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,524
if I don't make some trouble,

54
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:55,244
it'd be impolite.

55
00:02:55,564 --> 00:02:56,844
What exactly do you want?

56
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:07,684
I am

57
00:03:08,124 --> 00:03:10,925
very curious.

58
00:03:12,445 --> 00:03:14,964
Who exactly

59
00:03:15,524 --> 00:03:16,765
are you referring to?

60
00:03:20,005 --> 00:03:21,205
Second only to the Emperor

61
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:22,925
and above all others.

62
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,084
Who else could stir such chaos

63
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:30,445
besides you,

64
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:32,925
Chancellor Xu?

65
00:03:42,364 --> 00:03:45,124
Well played, General Xiao.

66
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:46,925
With just a few words,

67
00:03:47,285 --> 00:03:50,165
you've slung mud at me

68
00:03:50,485 --> 00:03:52,244
and General He.

69
00:03:53,564 --> 00:03:54,644
Where's your proof?

70
00:03:55,205 --> 00:03:56,485
Surely not just

71
00:03:57,124 --> 00:03:59,325
your baseless accusations?

72
00:04:02,005 --> 00:04:03,244
No need to panic, Chancellor.

73
00:04:04,605 --> 00:04:05,925
How could you be certain

74
00:04:06,684 --> 00:04:07,684
we lack evidence?

75
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:32,564
Taotao's drug

76
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:34,285
actually works pretty well.

77
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:51,884
(Just like when I lived here before.)

78
00:04:52,364 --> 00:04:53,605
(Almost nothing's changed.)

79
00:05:34,485 --> 00:05:35,004
Guards!

80
00:05:35,884 --> 00:05:36,444
Guards!

81
00:05:36,884 --> 00:05:38,004
Get in here now!

82
00:05:39,324 --> 00:05:39,845
Young Master.

83
00:05:39,884 --> 00:05:40,364
Master.

84
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:41,045
Master.

85
00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:43,845
Untie me.

86
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:46,244
Move!

87
00:05:47,324 --> 00:05:47,965
Where's He Yan?

88
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:49,405
What are you doing?

89
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:50,965
Find He Yan immediately!

90
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:54,684
Rufei.

91
00:05:55,085 --> 00:05:56,204
Rufei!

92
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:57,444
Master.

93
00:06:56,364 --> 00:06:57,085
The Linglong Box.

94
00:06:57,725 --> 00:06:58,485
Long time no see.

95
00:07:00,364 --> 00:07:00,925
Guards!

96
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:02,165
Guards!

97
00:07:03,364 --> 00:07:04,004
Guards!

98
00:07:06,204 --> 00:07:07,324
Chaos finally erupts.

99
00:07:08,324 --> 00:07:09,244
Seal off

100
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:10,324
the entire room.

101
00:07:10,324 --> 00:07:11,245
Don't let her escape!

102
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:12,165
- Yes!
- Yes!

103
00:07:14,444 --> 00:07:15,605
They arrived faster

104
00:07:15,605 --> 00:07:16,364
than I expected.

105
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:17,925
Good.

106
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:32,725
She's after

107
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:34,045
my letters with Chancellor Xu.

108
00:07:34,725 --> 00:07:36,564
(You won't leave alive.)

109
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,204
Quick! Guards!

110
00:07:40,324 --> 00:07:41,004
Keep searching!

111
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:41,405
Yes!

112
00:07:41,645 --> 00:07:42,285
Check this area.

113
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:43,004
Yes.

114
00:07:43,444 --> 00:07:44,045
Any traces?

115
00:07:44,485 --> 00:07:44,925
Nothing.

116
00:07:45,244 --> 00:07:45,925
Keep looking.

117
00:07:46,124 --> 00:07:46,884
This area, too.

118
00:07:57,204 --> 00:07:57,645
Sir.

119
00:07:57,884 --> 00:07:58,605
Why are you here?

120
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,204
For Sun Ling.

121
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:01,124
Sir.

122
00:08:01,444 --> 00:08:02,925
This death row inmate is involved in

123
00:08:03,285 --> 00:08:04,165
a case supervised

124
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:05,364
by the Ministry of Justice.

125
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:07,085
Not long ago,

126
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:09,525
he was transferred
from Yezhou for trial,

127
00:08:09,884 --> 00:08:10,725
waiting to be killed.

128
00:08:11,085 --> 00:08:12,804
The higher-ups
ordered strict supervision.

129
00:08:13,324 --> 00:08:14,165
Without a reason...

130
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:17,564
It's you, Mr. Chu.

131
00:08:18,525 --> 00:08:19,285
This way, sir.

132
00:08:19,444 --> 00:08:20,124
After you.

133
00:08:22,324 --> 00:08:23,085
Right this way.

134
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:30,604
Please enter, sir.

135
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:40,245
You may leave now.

136
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,084
Yes.

137
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:45,165
Sun Ling.

138
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:51,684
You...

139
00:08:52,604 --> 00:08:53,245
You are...

140
00:08:55,204 --> 00:08:56,844
C-Chu Zhao?

141
00:08:57,684 --> 00:08:58,285
It's me.

142
00:08:58,684 --> 00:08:59,365
You...

143
00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:00,285
Why are you here?

144
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:02,204
You're behind bars

145
00:09:02,684 --> 00:09:03,684
and to be executed soon.

146
00:09:05,564 --> 00:09:06,245
I...

147
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:07,285
I want to live!

148
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:08,484
I want to live!

149
00:09:09,084 --> 00:09:09,604
Mr. Chu!

150
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:10,604
Mr. Chu!

151
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:11,525
I want to live!

152
00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:12,365
Save me!

153
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:13,804
Save me! I don't want to die!

154
00:09:14,045 --> 00:09:15,084
Your crime is grave.

155
00:09:15,844 --> 00:09:17,005
No one can save you.

156
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:19,684
But...

157
00:09:20,365 --> 00:09:21,285
But?

158
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:22,484
But what?

159
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:23,724
I can let you

160
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,564
avenge your father

161
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,684
while still breathing.

162
00:09:27,684 --> 00:09:28,736
(Account Book)

163
00:09:30,564 --> 00:09:31,564
This...

164
00:09:31,724 --> 00:09:32,525
This is the ledger

165
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:34,405
of my father's transactions

166
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:35,925
with Xu Jingfu!

167
00:09:36,444 --> 00:09:37,844
H-How did this end up with you?

168
00:09:40,084 --> 00:09:40,724
Correct.

169
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:42,365
Your father worked diligently

170
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:43,804
to embezzle money for him,

171
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:46,045
only to be sacrificed as a scapegoat.

172
00:09:46,245 --> 00:09:47,804
Dragging your entire family down.

173
00:09:48,925 --> 00:09:50,125
Quite tragic.

174
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:56,564
Stop the false compassion.

175
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:00,525
You're partly responsible for

176
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:02,564
my father's death.

177
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:07,964
But

178
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,925
(Account Book)
that old fox Xu Jingfu

179
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:11,125
is the real culprit

180
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:13,084
who destroyed my family!

181
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,484
My father cherished me dearly.

182
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,005
How could I not avenge him?

183
00:10:20,768 --> 00:10:22,336
(Transactions)

184
00:10:24,765 --> 00:10:25,365
Tell me.

185
00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:27,245
What should I do?

186
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,844
I want you to surrender this ledger

187
00:10:34,804 --> 00:10:36,125
and expose

188
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,444
Xu Jingfu's corruption and bribery.

189
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:53,684
Officially,

190
00:10:54,564 --> 00:10:55,765
I was never here today.

191
00:10:57,165 --> 00:10:57,765
Correct?

192
00:10:59,125 --> 00:10:59,804
Yes.

193
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:01,804
Yes.

194
00:11:34,324 --> 00:11:35,285
Father.

195
00:11:45,844 --> 00:11:46,484
Yan.

196
00:11:47,525 --> 00:11:48,005
Mother...

197
00:12:04,576 --> 00:12:08,285
(Spirit Tablet of Daughter He Yan)

198
00:12:08,285 --> 00:12:09,964
(She burns incense, chants scriptures)

199
00:12:10,525 --> 00:12:11,324
(and prays)

200
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:13,045
(for me daily.)

201
00:12:15,324 --> 00:12:16,844
(So in this mansion,)

202
00:12:17,964 --> 00:12:19,604
(there's still someone
who remembers me,)

203
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:22,765
(remembers He Yan.)

204
00:12:27,324 --> 00:12:27,804
Madam He.

205
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:29,645
Is anyone in the shrine?

206
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:33,125
Don't disturb my prayers.

207
00:12:33,324 --> 00:12:34,165
All of you, out!

208
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:35,925
- Yes!
- Yes!

209
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:38,765
Quickly.

210
00:12:39,245 --> 00:12:39,844
Leave!

211
00:12:42,005 --> 00:12:42,604
Go now!

212
00:12:43,005 --> 00:12:43,684
Hurry!

213
00:12:44,324 --> 00:12:45,125
Go!

214
00:12:54,964 --> 00:12:55,484
Anything?

215
00:12:55,964 --> 00:12:56,724
Nothing.

216
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:58,005
Found her?

217
00:12:58,204 --> 00:12:58,964
- No.
- No.

218
00:13:01,165 --> 00:13:01,765
Rufei.

219
00:13:05,245 --> 00:13:05,604
What is

220
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:07,484
all this commotion about?

221
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:08,525
Madam.

222
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:09,844
Did you happen to

223
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:10,885
see anyone earlier?

224
00:13:12,444 --> 00:13:13,365
I haven't seen anyone.

225
00:13:30,804 --> 00:13:31,365
Rufei.

226
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:35,765
Rufei.

227
00:13:44,896 --> 00:13:47,584
(Spirit Tablet of Daughter He Yan)

228
00:13:59,324 --> 00:14:00,005
Rufei.

229
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:06,525
Rufei.

230
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:14,005
Rufei, don't be like this.

231
00:14:14,165 --> 00:14:15,645
This is your sister's tablet.

232
00:14:16,084 --> 00:14:16,444
Don't.

233
00:14:16,444 --> 00:14:17,005
Let go!

234
00:14:19,045 --> 00:14:19,645
Rufei.

235
00:14:21,324 --> 00:14:23,084
You let her escape.

236
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:24,724
Is that so?

237
00:14:44,804 --> 00:14:45,405
Enough.

238
00:14:45,964 --> 00:14:47,724
We've had enough tea.

239
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,005
General Xiao.

240
00:14:49,365 --> 00:14:51,564
Since you intend to fabricate evidence

241
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:53,285
to frame me,

242
00:14:54,084 --> 00:14:55,525
then go ahead quickly.

243
00:14:58,045 --> 00:14:58,525
My lord,

244
00:14:58,885 --> 00:14:59,444
Mr. Xiao's man

245
00:14:59,444 --> 00:15:00,204
is outside,

246
00:15:00,444 --> 00:15:00,925
saying

247
00:15:00,925 --> 00:15:01,964
to report something.

248
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:03,484
Chancellor,

249
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:05,604
my guard carries no weapons.

250
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,844
Surely you won't obstruct him?

251
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:10,084
You jest, General Xiao.

252
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:45,084
Do you recognize this Linglong Box?

253
00:15:46,564 --> 00:15:47,125
Of course.

254
00:15:47,804 --> 00:15:48,885
After all, His Majesty

255
00:15:49,245 --> 00:15:51,204
publicly bestowed it
upon General Feihong.

256
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:52,925
You

257
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:54,484
surely remember.

258
00:15:58,564 --> 00:16:00,005
This is General He's stuff.

259
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:02,285
How did this end up in your hands?

260
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:04,604
Wasn't it you

261
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,324
who told us to search for evidence?

262
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:11,084
He Yan happened to be

263
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:13,444
at the He Mansion today

264
00:16:13,925 --> 00:16:15,964
and retrieved her Linglong Box.

265
00:16:17,285 --> 00:16:18,165
This box contains

266
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:19,765
intricate mechanisms,

267
00:16:20,684 --> 00:16:22,484
perfect for concealing important items.

268
00:16:24,444 --> 00:16:26,165
He Rufei thought the same,

269
00:16:27,724 --> 00:16:28,444
believing

270
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,804
by keeping

271
00:16:30,804 --> 00:16:32,005
certain life-saving evidence

272
00:16:32,684 --> 00:16:33,604
in here,

273
00:16:34,844 --> 00:16:36,324
he could rest easy.

274
00:16:37,444 --> 00:16:38,245
Unluckily,

275
00:16:39,005 --> 00:16:40,684
it still fell into our hands.

276
00:16:41,564 --> 00:16:42,604
Send him out.

277
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:11,925
Today,

278
00:17:12,284 --> 00:17:13,524
He Yan came to my residence,

279
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:15,365
attempting to steal

280
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:17,645
our letters.

281
00:17:19,565 --> 00:17:20,645
What a pity.

282
00:17:20,964 --> 00:17:21,845
Her schemes

283
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,845
still failed.

284
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,244
I never expected

285
00:17:26,684 --> 00:17:27,764
to find anything here.

286
00:17:28,565 --> 00:17:30,085
I got back this box

287
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:31,244
simply because it

288
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:32,805
belonged to

289
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,925
General Feihong.

290
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:35,325
Seeing this,

291
00:17:35,325 --> 00:17:36,524
Xu Jingfu would assume

292
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:38,325
I've obtained evidence

293
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,484
from He Rufei,

294
00:17:39,845 --> 00:17:41,004
regardless of

295
00:17:41,244 --> 00:17:42,204
its actual contents.

296
00:17:42,565 --> 00:17:43,845
After this,

297
00:17:44,405 --> 00:17:45,325
I doubt

298
00:17:45,405 --> 00:17:46,365
Xu Jingfu will continue

299
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:47,845
to believe He Rufei.

300
00:17:48,605 --> 00:17:49,684
(To He Rufei)
Show me.

301
00:17:56,764 --> 00:17:57,764
The letters are safe.

302
00:17:58,204 --> 00:17:59,524
Rest assured, Chancellor.

303
00:18:00,605 --> 00:18:02,125
Then show me.

304
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:05,484
Chancellor,

305
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,244
you already know

306
00:18:07,325 --> 00:18:08,845
the content of these letters.

307
00:18:09,204 --> 00:18:10,284
You just need to know

308
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:11,085
He Yan

309
00:18:11,405 --> 00:18:13,365
took no evidence with her.

310
00:18:13,764 --> 00:18:14,565
That's enough.

311
00:18:16,204 --> 00:18:17,885
You fear my scrutiny?

312
00:18:18,484 --> 00:18:19,125
Correct?

313
00:18:20,565 --> 00:18:22,605
You distrust me?

314
00:18:24,565 --> 00:18:26,405
Xu Jingfu is cunning.

315
00:18:27,284 --> 00:18:28,524
He won't trust easily.

316
00:18:29,004 --> 00:18:30,845
When I dealt with Xu Jingfu today

317
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,004
at his mansion,

318
00:18:33,444 --> 00:18:34,764
he remained composed

319
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:37,925
until he saw this Linglong Box.

320
00:18:38,645 --> 00:18:39,645
Then panic set in.

321
00:18:40,405 --> 00:18:41,244
Of course.

322
00:18:42,284 --> 00:18:43,764
He might disregard other things,

323
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:45,565
but those letters

324
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:48,925
were written by him personally.

325
00:18:49,204 --> 00:18:50,645
They're irrefutable evidence.

326
00:18:51,244 --> 00:18:52,204
He can't deny it.

327
00:18:52,405 --> 00:18:53,524
He Rufei doesn't

328
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:54,645
trust Xu Jingfu either.

329
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:55,805
It seems

330
00:18:56,484 --> 00:18:57,684
he wouldn't hand over

331
00:18:57,724 --> 00:18:58,845
those letters to him.

332
00:18:59,244 --> 00:18:59,925
After all,

333
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:02,524
that's the only bargaining chip he has

334
00:19:02,524 --> 00:19:03,565
against Xu Jingfu.

335
00:19:04,284 --> 00:19:05,405
So from the beginning,

336
00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:06,724
my goal wasn't actually

337
00:19:06,925 --> 00:19:08,325
to obtain the so-called evidence.

338
00:19:08,885 --> 00:19:09,724
Time was too tight

339
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,044
to find anything.

340
00:19:12,044 --> 00:19:13,204
It was just a feint.

341
00:19:14,325 --> 00:19:16,125
We just need to make Xu Jingfu believe

342
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:17,764
that we've obtained evidence

343
00:19:18,204 --> 00:19:19,405
from He Rufei.

344
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:21,524
Both of them harbor guilty secrets.

345
00:19:22,044 --> 00:19:23,284
Trust died long ago.

346
00:19:23,805 --> 00:19:24,845
The rupture awaits them.

347
00:19:25,524 --> 00:19:26,365
Just

348
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:28,244
not tonight yet.

349
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:30,964
No matter.

350
00:19:31,925 --> 00:19:33,444
It'll come soon enough.

351
00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:35,365
Enough.

352
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:36,964
Keep these safe.

353
00:19:37,565 --> 00:19:39,684
Don't let them
fall into the wrong hands.

354
00:19:41,204 --> 00:19:42,125
Thank you, Chancellor.

355
00:19:42,605 --> 00:19:45,044
I'll guard them with my life.

356
00:19:51,645 --> 00:19:53,165
As you witnessed today,

357
00:19:53,565 --> 00:19:55,684
He Yan came to your mansion triumphantly

358
00:19:55,724 --> 00:19:56,805
to flaunt her victory.

359
00:19:57,004 --> 00:19:58,405
This was clearly retaliation.

360
00:19:59,605 --> 00:20:01,004
Xiao Jue and her

361
00:20:01,605 --> 00:20:03,484
came fully prepared.

362
00:20:04,484 --> 00:20:05,284
It appears

363
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:10,284
we must strike first.

364
00:20:11,885 --> 00:20:13,165
What's your plan?

365
00:20:14,204 --> 00:20:15,724
We must deal with Xiao Jue now.

366
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:16,805
At least,

367
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:19,325
we must strip him of military authority.

368
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:20,964
At the morning court in two days,

369
00:20:21,405 --> 00:20:23,805
I'll handle him myself.

370
00:20:25,244 --> 00:20:26,444
As for He Yan,

371
00:20:27,044 --> 00:20:28,645
that's your responsibility.

372
00:20:31,165 --> 00:20:32,845
At your service, Chancellor.

373
00:20:40,775 --> 00:20:44,246
(Xiao Mansion)

374
00:20:56,044 --> 00:20:56,845
Who is this?

375
00:20:58,405 --> 00:20:59,325
This is

376
00:21:00,805 --> 00:21:01,764
Madam He.

377
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:07,565
(The Xiao Mansion
and He Mansion are far apart.)

378
00:21:08,365 --> 00:21:09,605
(She deliberately detoured,)

379
00:21:10,405 --> 00:21:11,805
(probably to see me.)

380
00:21:12,845 --> 00:21:13,484
Thank you

381
00:21:14,244 --> 00:21:15,085
for that day, madam.

382
00:21:17,964 --> 00:21:18,724
No need for thanks.

383
00:21:19,805 --> 00:21:20,684
I'm glad you're safe.

384
00:21:21,964 --> 00:21:22,805
It's all that counts.

385
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:25,885
How have you been?

386
00:21:26,845 --> 00:21:28,605
Have your injuries healed completely?

387
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:31,284
I've fully recovered.

388
00:21:31,645 --> 00:21:32,724
No need for concern.

389
00:21:32,928 --> 00:21:34,085
(Xiao Mansion)

390
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:34,724
Yeah.

391
00:21:35,204 --> 00:21:36,204
Leaving the He Mansion

392
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:37,964
was the best for you.

393
00:21:38,845 --> 00:21:39,524
Madam He.

394
00:21:40,325 --> 00:21:41,444
There are ears.

395
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:42,524
Be discreet.

396
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:44,204
But...

397
00:21:44,244 --> 00:21:45,165
Return home.

398
00:21:58,165 --> 00:21:59,044
Take care of yourself.

399
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:13,244
Your Majesty,

400
00:22:13,964 --> 00:22:15,845
Wutuo envoy Maningbu

401
00:22:16,444 --> 00:22:18,484
arrived in the capital yesterday.

402
00:22:18,925 --> 00:22:20,044
In my humble opinion,

403
00:22:20,284 --> 00:22:21,244
we should host a banquet

404
00:22:21,645 --> 00:22:23,405
in three days

405
00:22:23,565 --> 00:22:25,284
to showcase

406
00:22:25,484 --> 00:22:27,645
our reputation as a civilized nation.

407
00:22:28,244 --> 00:22:31,284
What do you think, Your Majesty?

408
00:22:31,964 --> 00:22:32,565
Approved.

409
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,645
Maningbu's visit

410
00:22:34,845 --> 00:22:38,044
is under orders from the Wutuo King

411
00:22:38,204 --> 00:22:40,244
to establish peace,

412
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,044
cease hostilities between us,

413
00:22:42,165 --> 00:22:43,605
and establish a pact

414
00:22:43,684 --> 00:22:46,244
for perpetual amity.

415
00:22:57,845 --> 00:22:59,845
Wutuo has proposed three terms

416
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,845
for the peace negotiations.

417
00:23:02,365 --> 00:23:02,885
First,

418
00:23:03,444 --> 00:23:04,925
Wei and Wutuo

419
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,764
shall be brotherly nations.

420
00:23:07,244 --> 00:23:09,605
Your Majesty, being elder,

421
00:23:09,964 --> 00:23:12,885
shall be addressed
as elder brother by the Wutuo King.

422
00:23:13,244 --> 00:23:16,004
This hierarchy shall continue
for future generations.

423
00:23:17,444 --> 00:23:18,125
Second,

424
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,004
both sides shall withdraw troops.

425
00:23:20,284 --> 00:23:22,605
Border cities
of both nations shall maintain

426
00:23:22,964 --> 00:23:24,204
current defensive structures.

427
00:23:24,764 --> 00:23:27,165
No new fortifications
shall be constructed.

428
00:23:28,284 --> 00:23:29,125
And the third point?

429
00:23:29,964 --> 00:23:31,365
Both sides at the border

430
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:33,524
shall establish a market

431
00:23:34,044 --> 00:23:35,365
and conduct mutual commerce

432
00:23:35,845 --> 00:23:37,004
with profits split equally.

433
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:39,684
That's the third proposal.

434
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:49,724
Preposterous!

435
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,444
Wutuo people are cunning.

436
00:23:51,724 --> 00:23:52,524
We can't trust them!

437
00:23:52,605 --> 00:23:53,244
- Exactly.
- No.

438
00:23:53,805 --> 00:23:54,964
If this can prevent war,

439
00:23:55,284 --> 00:23:56,565
it's worth trying.

440
00:23:58,805 --> 00:23:59,524
Chancellor Xu,

441
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:00,724
Mr. Xiao,

442
00:24:01,165 --> 00:24:02,204
what are your thoughts?

443
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:04,085
In my humble opinion,

444
00:24:04,405 --> 00:24:05,605
since we

445
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:07,365
want friendly relations with Wutuo,

446
00:24:08,044 --> 00:24:09,645
establishing trade markets

447
00:24:10,044 --> 00:24:11,365
is acceptable.

448
00:24:12,004 --> 00:24:13,964
Our cooperation

449
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:15,325
will bring mutual benefits

450
00:24:15,405 --> 00:24:19,244
and greatly aid
our people's livelihoods.

451
00:24:24,524 --> 00:24:25,244
Setting aside

452
00:24:25,845 --> 00:24:26,805
the fairness

453
00:24:26,805 --> 00:24:28,244
of this 50-50 split,

454
00:24:29,085 --> 00:24:30,444
I want to ask you,

455
00:24:31,325 --> 00:24:32,845
where does Wutuo plan

456
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:34,684
to build this market?

457
00:24:36,484 --> 00:24:37,325
Mingshui.

458
00:24:39,724 --> 00:24:41,004
How can it be placed there?

459
00:24:46,204 --> 00:24:46,764
Outrageous!

460
00:24:46,764 --> 00:24:47,645
Unthinkable!

461
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:49,044
This goes too far!

462
00:24:49,044 --> 00:24:49,805
A provocation!

463
00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:50,484
We cannot agree!

464
00:24:50,484 --> 00:24:51,365
A humiliation!

465
00:24:51,805 --> 00:24:52,684
Clearly intentional!

466
00:24:52,684 --> 00:24:53,204
True.

467
00:24:53,244 --> 00:24:53,964
We mustn't agree.

468
00:24:57,044 --> 00:24:57,605
Your Majesty,

469
00:24:58,244 --> 00:24:59,284
I object.

470
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:00,845
Mingshui

471
00:25:01,325 --> 00:25:03,085
is our strategic border fortress.

472
00:25:03,405 --> 00:25:05,085
Placing the market there

473
00:25:05,524 --> 00:25:06,724
would leave Wei vulnerable

474
00:25:06,925 --> 00:25:08,125
if war reignites.

475
00:25:08,805 --> 00:25:09,405
Moreover,

476
00:25:10,204 --> 00:25:10,845
Mingshui

477
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:13,724
holds the remains of 30,000

478
00:25:13,724 --> 00:25:14,484
Xiao Army soldiers.

479
00:25:15,325 --> 00:25:16,524
Does Wutuo's proposal

480
00:25:16,925 --> 00:25:18,125
show genuine sincerity

481
00:25:18,165 --> 00:25:19,565
for peace with Wei?

482
00:25:21,565 --> 00:25:23,684
This insults Wei's dignity!

483
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:25,885
They hold treacherous intentions!

484
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:37,125
The Xiao Army

485
00:25:37,325 --> 00:25:38,885
serves our nation.

486
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,325
From marshals to foot soldiers,

487
00:25:41,645 --> 00:25:42,724
it is their duty

488
00:25:42,724 --> 00:25:44,125
to fall in battle.

489
00:25:44,444 --> 00:25:45,684
But General Fengyun,

490
00:25:46,085 --> 00:25:48,244
you cling to past grievances,

491
00:25:48,805 --> 00:25:50,605
ignoring the greater good.

492
00:25:51,524 --> 00:25:52,365
How does this honor

493
00:25:52,925 --> 00:25:54,405
our fallen warriors?

494
00:25:55,244 --> 00:25:56,684
Soldiers die in war,

495
00:25:57,605 --> 00:25:58,764
only to become

496
00:25:58,885 --> 00:26:00,085
bargaining chips for others.

497
00:26:00,484 --> 00:26:01,925
General He, if you want compromise,

498
00:26:01,925 --> 00:26:02,724
you may,

499
00:26:03,085 --> 00:26:03,724
but

500
00:26:04,204 --> 00:26:06,085
don't make your gains
off their sacrifice.

501
00:26:11,365 --> 00:26:12,244
To me,

502
00:26:13,845 --> 00:26:15,004
until we expose

503
00:26:15,004 --> 00:26:16,605
the Mingshui Battle traitor,

504
00:26:17,724 --> 00:26:18,565
this matter

505
00:26:20,085 --> 00:26:22,125
remains unresolved.

506
00:26:26,925 --> 00:26:27,605
Mr. Xiao,

507
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:29,165
rise.

508
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:35,204
Your Majesty,

509
00:26:35,805 --> 00:26:37,165
Wutuo's schemes are endless.

510
00:26:38,004 --> 00:26:39,125
Today's peace treaty

511
00:26:39,484 --> 00:26:41,004
will bring more demands tomorrow.

512
00:26:41,724 --> 00:26:42,284
Must we

513
00:26:42,885 --> 00:26:44,405
repeat the tragedies in Mingshui

514
00:26:44,444 --> 00:26:45,605
and Huayuan?

515
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:47,684
How many armies do we have

516
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:49,565
to feed Wutuo's slaughter?

517
00:26:50,605 --> 00:26:51,365
Next,

518
00:26:53,885 --> 00:26:55,444
shall we cede territory?

519
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:57,004
Pay reparations?

520
00:26:57,885 --> 00:26:58,765
Offer peace marriages?

521
00:26:59,044 --> 00:27:00,605
- T-This...
- Yeah.

522
00:27:00,605 --> 00:27:01,484
He speaks the truth!

523
00:27:02,004 --> 00:27:03,004
There's no bottom line!

524
00:27:03,605 --> 00:27:04,204
How dare you!

525
00:27:08,165 --> 00:27:09,204
What's next?

526
00:27:10,204 --> 00:27:12,044
Wei's imminent collapse?

527
00:27:13,085 --> 00:27:14,484
Such audacity!

528
00:27:15,365 --> 00:27:16,444
Is it because I've treated

529
00:27:16,484 --> 00:27:17,365
you too kindly

530
00:27:17,684 --> 00:27:18,444
that you've become

531
00:27:18,444 --> 00:27:20,044
so oblivious to propriety,

532
00:27:20,524 --> 00:27:21,764
arrogant

533
00:27:22,044 --> 00:27:23,044
and insolent in court?

534
00:27:23,764 --> 00:27:24,764
Get out of my sight!

535
00:27:24,885 --> 00:27:25,645
Reflect at home!

536
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:56,925
Establishing markets

537
00:27:57,605 --> 00:27:59,524
and signing treaties are important.

538
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:00,684
We'll revisit this.

539
00:28:02,524 --> 00:28:03,044
Leave.

540
00:28:03,444 --> 00:28:05,405
Court adjourned.

541
00:28:05,964 --> 00:28:07,805
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

542
00:28:13,764 --> 00:28:15,645
We mustn't fall into Wutuo's scheme.

543
00:28:15,684 --> 00:28:16,325
Indeed.

544
00:28:20,244 --> 00:28:22,085
Xiao Jue is already under house arrest.

545
00:28:22,724 --> 00:28:24,044
Why do you still appear

546
00:28:24,484 --> 00:28:25,565
so troubled?

547
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:27,724
Xiao Jue is insignificant.

548
00:28:28,845 --> 00:28:30,605
I promised Maningbu

549
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:32,325
that I'd ensure

550
00:28:32,764 --> 00:28:34,484
the trade market establishment.

551
00:28:35,325 --> 00:28:36,724
Earlier, His Majesty

552
00:28:36,764 --> 00:28:38,724
might've punished Xiao Jue,

553
00:28:39,645 --> 00:28:40,605
but he didn't approve

554
00:28:41,325 --> 00:28:43,244
the trade market proposal.

555
00:28:44,444 --> 00:28:47,044
He no longer obeys me

556
00:28:47,605 --> 00:28:50,085
as blindly as before.

557
00:29:13,484 --> 00:29:14,325
Is this fanfare

558
00:29:14,565 --> 00:29:15,284
enough?

559
00:29:16,085 --> 00:29:16,764
Any grander

560
00:29:16,925 --> 00:29:18,165
and Yaojing might gain

561
00:29:18,204 --> 00:29:19,684
a surplus of deaf citizens.

562
00:29:21,925 --> 00:29:23,405
Is this the top scholar's parade?

563
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:25,365
No exams were held this year.

564
00:29:25,444 --> 00:29:26,605
No champion to celebrate.

565
00:29:26,964 --> 00:29:28,484
Besides, look at the rider.

566
00:29:28,645 --> 00:29:29,524
Rugged features,

567
00:29:29,524 --> 00:29:30,444
coarse demeanor.

568
00:29:30,724 --> 00:29:31,524
He's unlike

569
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,885
any scholar.

570
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:33,524
In my view,

571
00:29:33,764 --> 00:29:35,284
this must be a wedding procession.

572
00:29:35,684 --> 00:29:37,004
But no bridal attire.

573
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:38,724
And marrying so late in life

574
00:29:39,004 --> 00:29:40,044
yet making a spectacle?

575
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:40,964
How...

576
00:29:41,204 --> 00:29:42,605
How embarrassing!

577
00:29:42,724 --> 00:29:43,524
Shameful.

578
00:30:05,964 --> 00:30:06,405
Well?

579
00:30:06,724 --> 00:30:07,925
Did I do it well?

580
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:11,165
Commander Li,

581
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:12,444
long time no see.

582
00:30:13,408 --> 00:30:16,928
(Ganming Pavilion)

583
00:30:17,925 --> 00:30:18,724
Arrest the owner.

584
00:30:18,964 --> 00:30:20,325
He's a Wutuo spy in disguise

585
00:30:20,565 --> 00:30:21,805
who's lurked here for years.

586
00:30:22,004 --> 00:30:22,405
Everyone,

587
00:30:22,764 --> 00:30:23,565
bring all findings

588
00:30:23,684 --> 00:30:25,125
straight to the Ministry of War.

589
00:30:27,444 --> 00:30:28,845
(Ganming Pavilion)
Trinkets, toys.

590
00:30:28,964 --> 00:30:29,684
Take a look.

591
00:30:31,645 --> 00:30:32,684
Someone!

592
00:30:32,885 --> 00:30:34,125
Someone!

593
00:30:34,204 --> 00:30:35,444
Someone!

594
00:30:35,684 --> 00:30:36,365
Someone!

595
00:30:36,605 --> 00:30:37,204
Someone!

596
00:30:37,565 --> 00:30:38,085
Sun Ling,

597
00:30:38,284 --> 00:30:39,165
stay still!

598
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:40,125
I...

599
00:30:41,565 --> 00:30:42,444
What are you doing?

600
00:30:43,244 --> 00:30:44,044
I demand an appeal.

601
00:30:44,684 --> 00:30:46,044
I accuse the current Chancellor

602
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:46,805
Xu Jingfu!

603
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:47,405
Nonsense!

604
00:30:47,885 --> 00:30:48,645
I'm not lying!

605
00:30:49,284 --> 00:30:49,925
This ledger

606
00:30:50,044 --> 00:30:50,805
is proof.

607
00:30:54,805 --> 00:30:55,365
With Li Kuang,

608
00:30:55,365 --> 00:30:56,925
General Feihong's old friend, here,

609
00:30:58,165 --> 00:30:59,645
Xu Jingfu and He Rufei

610
00:30:59,885 --> 00:31:01,165
must be losing sleep over this.

611
00:31:05,805 --> 00:31:06,444
More than that.

612
00:31:07,524 --> 00:31:08,365
Mr. Chu

613
00:31:08,805 --> 00:31:09,645
must have visited

614
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:10,565
Xu Jingfu's residence,

615
00:31:10,925 --> 00:31:12,405
bearing more ill tidings.

616
00:31:30,565 --> 00:31:31,204
Sir.

617
00:31:36,405 --> 00:31:38,684
You've been occupied with state affairs.

618
00:31:39,724 --> 00:31:42,244
What brings you here today?

619
00:31:43,724 --> 00:31:44,724
I've learned

620
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:45,484
Li Kuang

621
00:31:45,764 --> 00:31:47,244
entered the capital publicly.

622
00:31:49,444 --> 00:31:51,925
I've heard of it.

623
00:31:58,284 --> 00:31:59,244
What else?

624
00:32:00,004 --> 00:32:01,524
Speak plainly.

625
00:32:03,524 --> 00:32:04,885
Sun Xiangfu's son Sun Ling

626
00:32:05,204 --> 00:32:06,565
was brought to the capital

627
00:32:07,565 --> 00:32:08,645
and has completed trial,

628
00:32:08,805 --> 00:32:09,684
awaiting execution.

629
00:32:10,484 --> 00:32:11,605
Facing imminent death,

630
00:32:11,845 --> 00:32:12,964
he's making his last move.

631
00:32:13,885 --> 00:32:15,484
He suddenly surrendered an account book,

632
00:32:15,565 --> 00:32:16,165
saying

633
00:32:17,365 --> 00:32:18,085
to accuse you.

634
00:32:28,004 --> 00:32:29,484
What is he accusing me of?

635
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,565
Of instigating Sun Xiangfu

636
00:32:34,605 --> 00:32:36,645
to commit large-scale corruption
and bribery.

637
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:45,764
I underestimated this man.

638
00:32:46,325 --> 00:32:48,565
I always thought he was a fool.

639
00:32:49,284 --> 00:32:50,204
I never expected

640
00:32:51,044 --> 00:32:52,085
he would have

641
00:32:52,605 --> 00:32:55,004
the audacity for a deathbed struggle.

642
00:32:55,764 --> 00:32:56,964
I took the liberty

643
00:32:57,284 --> 00:32:58,605
of having this matter silenced.

644
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:00,565
The account book is destroyed.

645
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:02,125
As for Sun Ling,

646
00:33:02,325 --> 00:33:03,524
he's already on death row.

647
00:33:03,885 --> 00:33:05,004
Currently held in isolation

648
00:33:05,204 --> 00:33:06,044
under strict guard.

649
00:33:06,204 --> 00:33:07,724
There's no need to worry.

650
00:33:09,724 --> 00:33:10,484
Excellent.

651
00:33:11,805 --> 00:33:12,845
You're thorough.

652
00:33:24,724 --> 00:33:25,325
By the way,

653
00:33:25,845 --> 00:33:27,165
on my way here earlier, I heard

654
00:33:27,645 --> 00:33:29,004
the owner of Ganming Pavilion

655
00:33:29,365 --> 00:33:30,244
was arrested

656
00:33:30,605 --> 00:33:31,484
for unknown reasons.

657
00:33:37,165 --> 00:33:37,764
Master,

658
00:33:38,284 --> 00:33:39,004
are you alright?

659
00:33:43,284 --> 00:33:44,325
With Li Kuang's arrival,

660
00:33:44,764 --> 00:33:45,724
the closure of the shop,

661
00:33:46,004 --> 00:33:46,925
and Sun Ling's report,

662
00:33:47,684 --> 00:33:49,204
he will make desperate moves.

663
00:33:50,004 --> 00:33:50,684
Not enough yet.

664
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,325
We need one last spark.

665
00:33:55,605 --> 00:33:56,284
But that spark

666
00:33:57,405 --> 00:33:58,845
will soon ignite the flames.

667
00:34:02,405 --> 00:34:03,124
Zilan,

668
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,044
your information network

669
00:34:06,164 --> 00:34:07,604
is remarkably efficient.

670
00:34:11,124 --> 00:34:12,325
Merely hearsay.

671
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,325
What a coincidence.

672
00:34:21,365 --> 00:34:22,365
My passing by

673
00:34:22,845 --> 00:34:24,084
wasn't accidental.

674
00:34:29,084 --> 00:34:29,805
It was Pingting

675
00:34:30,004 --> 00:34:31,444
who heard about their new tea

676
00:34:31,845 --> 00:34:32,964
and dragged me to sample it,

677
00:34:33,444 --> 00:34:34,725
preparing to buy it for you.

678
00:34:35,564 --> 00:34:36,524
But unexpectedly,

679
00:34:36,805 --> 00:34:37,885
the shop got into trouble.

680
00:34:38,964 --> 00:34:40,245
If you have doubts,

681
00:34:40,765 --> 00:34:41,524
simply ask Pingting

682
00:34:41,964 --> 00:34:42,845
to verify the truth.

683
00:34:49,245 --> 00:34:52,285
I was just asking.

684
00:34:52,805 --> 00:34:54,205
Don't take it to heart.

685
00:34:54,765 --> 00:34:55,484
Have some tea.

686
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:04,084
Master.

687
00:35:10,644 --> 00:35:11,484
Chancellor,

688
00:35:11,805 --> 00:35:13,164
I come bearing

689
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:14,084
His Majesty's decree.

690
00:35:14,805 --> 00:35:16,484
By the imperial decree,

691
00:35:17,205 --> 00:35:19,124
Wutuo insists on establishing the market

692
00:35:19,164 --> 00:35:21,004
at our strategic stronghold

693
00:35:21,325 --> 00:35:23,164
and demands equal profit splitting.

694
00:35:23,245 --> 00:35:24,725
They show no flexibility

695
00:35:24,925 --> 00:35:25,885
and lack sincerity.

696
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:27,084
Therefore,

697
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:28,765
further negotiations are pointless.

698
00:35:29,444 --> 00:35:30,205
Yes,

699
00:35:31,124 --> 00:35:32,124
Your Majesty.

700
00:35:34,685 --> 00:35:35,325
Please.

701
00:35:49,124 --> 00:35:50,285
Xu Jingfu must be

702
00:35:51,004 --> 00:35:52,325
in disarray by now.

703
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,805
Mr. Chu is his prized student.

704
00:35:55,205 --> 00:35:55,845
He'll surely

705
00:35:56,205 --> 00:35:57,925
seek Mr. Chu's counsel.

706
00:35:58,444 --> 00:35:59,725
The question is

707
00:36:00,205 --> 00:36:01,725
what advice Mr. Chu will offer.

708
00:36:09,805 --> 00:36:10,405
Here.

709
00:36:11,564 --> 00:36:12,725
Take the white pieces.

710
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:14,765
Try to break this deadlock.

711
00:36:24,004 --> 00:36:26,004
Chu Zhao is Xu Jingfu's student,

712
00:36:27,124 --> 00:36:28,725
so their methods align naturally.

713
00:36:29,845 --> 00:36:31,164
They'll likely escalate tensions

714
00:36:32,285 --> 00:36:33,604
to reap third-party benefits.

715
00:36:50,325 --> 00:36:53,205
This approach harms you

716
00:36:53,325 --> 00:36:56,405
without damaging the enemy.

717
00:36:58,604 --> 00:36:59,925
Don't you want to solve this?

718
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:01,885
Only by burning our boats

719
00:37:02,325 --> 00:37:03,805
can we break this deadlock.

720
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,044
Good.

721
00:37:13,604 --> 00:37:14,044
Master,

722
00:37:14,685 --> 00:37:15,725
General He is outside.

723
00:37:16,885 --> 00:37:18,004
Let him in.

724
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:22,044
You have a visitor.

725
00:37:22,484 --> 00:37:24,044
I shall take my leave.

726
00:37:34,484 --> 00:37:35,124
Earlier,

727
00:37:35,604 --> 00:37:37,164
Maningbu sent word again.

728
00:37:37,685 --> 00:37:39,644
He says the banquet is the deadline.

729
00:37:40,285 --> 00:37:40,925
Chancellor,

730
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:43,484
what should we do now?

731
00:37:48,044 --> 00:37:51,044
If His Majesty agrees,

732
00:37:51,524 --> 00:37:53,285
all will be well.

733
00:37:54,044 --> 00:37:55,484
If he refuses,

734
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:08,084
we'll replace him
with someone compliant.

735
00:38:15,648 --> 00:38:18,912
(Xiao Mansion)

736
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:06,325
Why is everyone here?

737
00:39:06,925 --> 00:39:07,765
Waiting for me?

738
00:39:08,124 --> 00:39:09,004
What can I do for you?

739
00:39:09,044 --> 00:39:09,685
Just tell me.

740
00:39:11,885 --> 00:39:12,405
Yan,

741
00:39:12,845 --> 00:39:13,885
I can't offer much help,

742
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:15,285
but I'll await good news.

743
00:39:16,044 --> 00:39:16,685
I don't know

744
00:39:16,725 --> 00:39:17,845
what you're planning to do,

745
00:39:18,164 --> 00:39:18,805
but I'm certain

746
00:39:19,205 --> 00:39:20,604
you'll achieve your goal.

747
00:39:24,964 --> 00:39:25,524
Don't you have

748
00:39:25,524 --> 00:39:26,484
anything to tell me?

749
00:39:27,564 --> 00:39:28,524
Return victorious.

750
00:39:32,365 --> 00:39:33,004
Thank you all.

751
00:39:34,365 --> 00:39:35,205
Tonight's banquet

752
00:39:35,925 --> 00:39:37,405
will bring the final resolution.

753
00:39:39,524 --> 00:39:41,444
I'll reclaim what's rightfully mine.
