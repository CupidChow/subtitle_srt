00:01:51,227 --> 00:01:52,067
It is

24
00:01:52,906 --> 00:01:54,186
the war drums being beaten.

25
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:00,907
Commander.

26
00:02:01,186 --> 00:02:02,027
Crisis at the border.

27
00:02:02,587 --> 00:02:03,466
Wutuo attacks Mingshui

28
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:04,867
and Huayuan simultaneously.

29
00:02:06,947 --> 00:02:08,547
No time to waste. Go to the palace now.

30
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:14,867
(Longtai Hall)

31
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:16,987
Wutuo actually broke the peace treaty

32
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:18,267
and invaded us again.

33
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:20,267
That's so unscrupulous!

34
00:02:21,147 --> 00:02:21,987
Xiao Jue.

35
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:23,587
You lead troops to Mingshui.

36
00:02:23,707 --> 00:02:25,746
This time, we must teach Wutuo a lesson

37
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,587
and ensure
they never dare invade us again.

38
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:29,827
As you command.

39
00:02:30,746 --> 00:02:31,586
He Yan.

40
00:02:31,827 --> 00:02:33,226
I order you to lead the Fuyue Army

41
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,307
and defend Rundu with Li Kuang

42
00:02:35,786 --> 00:02:37,107
to guard against Wutuo's raids.

43
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:39,066
Your Majesty.

44
00:02:39,147 --> 00:02:40,226
There's no battle in Rundu.

45
00:02:40,746 --> 00:02:41,626
Yet Wutuo's forces

46
00:02:42,027 --> 00:02:43,066
are approaching Huayuan.

47
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:44,107
It's threatening.

48
00:02:46,226 --> 00:02:47,387
There's no current conflict,

49
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,906
but Wutuo is full of tricks.

50
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:51,387
We must be alert.

51
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:52,867
As for Huayuan,

52
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,587
I've sent Yan He there,

53
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:57,547
with Chu Zhao as military supervisor

54
00:02:57,946 --> 00:02:58,786
to assist.

55
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:08,307
Yes, understood.

56
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,186
His Majesty wants me to guard Rundu,

57
00:03:25,427 --> 00:03:26,466
but Li Kuang is there.

58
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:27,666
Why send me too?

59
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:29,107
In my opinion,

60
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:30,867
His Majesty still distrusts us.

61
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:33,227
An emperor's balance of power
is an age-old strategy.

62
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:34,867
But there's wisdom

63
00:03:35,226 --> 00:03:36,427
in this arrangement.

64
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:39,427
Rundu lies between Huayuan and Mingshui.

65
00:03:39,746 --> 00:03:42,547
It allows quick support to both cities.

66
00:03:43,387 --> 00:03:44,227
Promise me

67
00:03:44,547 --> 00:03:45,906
you'll return safely.

68
00:03:48,307 --> 00:03:49,746
Take Wang Ba's team

69
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,427
to Rundu with you.

70
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,147
There's no battle there.

71
00:03:53,587 --> 00:03:54,746
Keep them with you.

72
00:03:55,107 --> 00:03:56,626
I have Feinu and Shen Han.

73
00:03:57,147 --> 00:03:58,066
With them guarding you,

74
00:03:58,387 --> 00:03:59,227
I'll feel assured.

75
00:04:00,786 --> 00:04:01,626
Okay.

76
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:08,186
Miss He.

77
00:04:14,946 --> 00:04:16,747
Congratulations.
You've won imperial favor

78
00:04:17,426 --> 00:04:19,306
and secured the supervisor position.

79
00:04:49,346 --> 00:04:51,426
A little tiger is roaring.

80
00:04:52,187 --> 00:04:53,947
A little tiger is roaring.

81
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:56,747
A little tiger is roaring.

82
00:05:00,786 --> 00:05:01,626
What's wrong?

83
00:05:02,027 --> 00:05:02,867
The baby kicked me.

84
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:06,906
Behave yourself,

85
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:09,787
or I'll punish you when I return.

86
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:11,426
Don't threaten our baby.

87
00:05:19,187 --> 00:05:20,027
Yan He.

88
00:05:21,147 --> 00:05:21,987
This time,

89
00:05:22,747 --> 00:05:24,187
let me go with you.

90
00:05:25,306 --> 00:05:28,067
I went along with troops before.

91
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:30,627
This is different!

92
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:32,546
You're pregnant now.

93
00:05:33,707 --> 00:05:35,466
The due date is still weeks away.

94
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:37,706
Besides,

95
00:05:38,387 --> 00:05:39,507
as a general's wife,

96
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,907
I can endure hardships.

97
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:45,107
Fine.

98
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,387
I'll stay by your side

99
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:48,866
and see the birth of our baby.

100
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:56,666
I'll be the best father in the capital.

101
00:06:05,051 --> 00:06:10,756
(Xiao Mansion)

102
00:06:10,756 --> 00:06:16,456
(Xiao Mansion)

103
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,466
You guys

104
00:06:21,986 --> 00:06:23,067
focus on the war.

105
00:06:23,587 --> 00:06:25,426
My wife and I will handle home affairs.

106
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:34,946
Miss He.

107
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:36,106
May you return safely.

108
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:08,008
(Xiao Mansion)

109
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,400
(Rundu City)

110
00:07:52,026 --> 00:07:53,706
General He, time to eat.

111
00:08:14,147 --> 00:08:14,987
General He.

112
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:17,507
I heard you returned
to write battle reports.

113
00:08:18,226 --> 00:08:19,147
Haven't started yet?

114
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:22,106
Nothing to report.

115
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:23,827
Wutuo forces

116
00:08:24,027 --> 00:08:25,387
continue assaults on Huayuan

117
00:08:25,747 --> 00:08:26,587
and Mingshui,

118
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:28,466
while Rundu remains peaceful.

119
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:31,066
General.

120
00:08:34,906 --> 00:08:35,946
General! Emergency!

121
00:08:36,906 --> 00:08:37,786
New battle report.

122
00:08:37,946 --> 00:08:39,186
Wutuo sent reinforcements

123
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:40,107
to attack Huayuan.

124
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:43,467
General Yan has fought nonstop
for two days.

125
00:08:45,787 --> 00:08:47,027
- Mai.
- Yes.

126
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:47,987
You go tell Li Kuang

127
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:49,387
that I'll leave 5,000 soldiers

128
00:08:49,507 --> 00:08:50,387
to defend the city.

129
00:08:51,946 --> 00:08:55,066
The rest will reinforce Huayuan with me.

130
00:08:55,747 --> 00:08:56,587
- Yes.
- Yes.

131
00:09:01,563 --> 00:09:04,679
(He)

132
00:09:23,227 --> 00:09:24,867
I heard you all rushed here

133
00:09:24,987 --> 00:09:25,867
from Rundu

134
00:09:26,227 --> 00:09:27,666
and repelled enemies with Yan He.

135
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:29,586
I've prepared a banquet

136
00:09:30,147 --> 00:09:31,066
to honor your victory.

137
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:35,627
- Great.
- Great.

138
00:09:35,946 --> 00:09:40,186
- Great.
- Great.

139
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:53,146
Xiu, I'm back.

140
00:09:57,186 --> 00:09:58,107
He has returned.

141
00:10:26,027 --> 00:10:26,867
Madam.

142
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:27,906
What's wrong?

143
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:36,307
Careful, Madam.

144
00:10:37,306 --> 00:10:38,146
What's happening?

145
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:40,746
Someone!

146
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:41,946
Madam is going into labor.

147
00:10:42,107 --> 00:10:43,107
Someone!

148
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:46,387
- General Yan!
- General!

149
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:47,426
- General!
- General Yan!

150
00:10:48,546 --> 00:10:49,386
Medic!

151
00:10:49,507 --> 00:10:50,347
Medic!

152
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:51,347
Medic!

153
00:10:51,706 --> 00:10:52,546
Don't.

154
00:10:54,347 --> 00:10:55,546
Don't tell Xiu.

155
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:58,546
She's pregnant.

156
00:10:59,387 --> 00:11:00,306
Don't alarm her.

157
00:11:01,706 --> 00:11:02,627
Hang in there!

158
00:11:03,107 --> 00:11:04,107
The medic is coming.

159
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:06,467
Promise me.

160
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:14,107
Xiu.

161
00:11:16,946 --> 00:11:17,786
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:53,706 --> 00:11:54,906
Take a deep breath and push!

163
00:11:54,906 --> 00:11:56,027
Deep breath, Madam.

164
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:56,906
Keep pushing!

165
00:11:56,906 --> 00:11:57,746
Push harder!

166
00:11:58,746 --> 00:12:00,186
Push! Keep pushing!

167
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,026
Breathe in.

168
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:02,426
Breathe in.

169
00:12:02,627 --> 00:12:03,467
Breathe in.

170
00:12:04,746 --> 00:12:05,586
Madam.

171
00:12:05,586 --> 00:12:06,786
Y-Yan He...

172
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:09,027
Push, Madam!

173
00:12:09,267 --> 00:12:10,227
Push! Hold your breath!

174
00:12:11,946 --> 00:12:13,147
Hold it! Keep holding!

175
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:14,107
Hold your breath!

176
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:14,947
Almost done!

177
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:16,026
Yan He

178
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:20,027
is still mopping up remaining enemies
behind the lines.

179
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:21,627
He'll return later.

180
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:22,467
Push harder, Madam!

181
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:24,706
Hold your breath and push!

182
00:12:24,706 --> 00:12:25,546
That's it!

183
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:26,786
Hold and push!

184
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:30,107
It's born!

185
00:12:33,107 --> 00:12:33,947
Madam!

186
00:12:34,347 --> 00:12:35,227
Congratulations!

187
00:12:35,627 --> 00:12:36,507
It's a girl!

188
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:37,386
She's born, Madam!

189
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,027
She's beautiful!

190
00:12:39,387 --> 00:12:40,227
Careful.

191
00:12:48,507 --> 00:12:49,586
It's Muxia.

192
00:12:50,586 --> 00:12:51,426
Muxia?

193
00:12:53,627 --> 00:12:54,546
Yan He chose this name.

194
00:12:55,306 --> 00:12:56,507
Liangjiang for a boy,

195
00:12:57,507 --> 00:12:58,867
Muxia for a girl.

196
00:13:01,426 --> 00:13:02,266
Muxia,

197
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:04,666
your father is a great hero.

198
00:13:05,347 --> 00:13:06,627
Muxia, you will grow up

199
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:08,906
to carry on your father's legacy.

200
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:11,947
Muxia

201
00:13:13,186 --> 00:13:14,666
will become

202
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:16,906
a good general

203
00:13:17,107 --> 00:13:17,947
like her father.

204
00:13:24,426 --> 00:13:25,266
So adorable.

205
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:29,347
Muxia.

206
00:13:30,347 --> 00:13:31,187
Muxia.

207
00:13:35,676 --> 00:13:38,116
(Yan)

208
00:14:13,706 --> 00:14:16,666
Are Mrs. Yan and the child safe?

209
00:14:17,586 --> 00:14:18,426
Safe?

210
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:19,707
Yes,

211
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:21,107
they're safe.

212
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,227
But the child lost her father at birth.

213
00:14:24,946 --> 00:14:25,867
Father and daughter

214
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:29,267
never even met.

215
00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:32,867
This battle could have ended sooner

216
00:14:34,027 --> 00:14:35,306
with fewer casualties.

217
00:14:36,346 --> 00:14:38,747
All because of your loyal advice,

218
00:14:39,987 --> 00:14:40,946
His Majesty

219
00:14:42,027 --> 00:14:44,306
feared our concentrated military power,

220
00:14:45,107 --> 00:14:45,947
ordering me

221
00:14:46,627 --> 00:14:48,426
to station the Fuyue Army in Rundu,

222
00:14:49,826 --> 00:14:51,227
scattering our forces.

223
00:14:52,107 --> 00:14:54,306
So, we couldn't deliver
a decisive blow to Wutuo.

224
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:00,267
Is this the outcome

225
00:15:01,946 --> 00:15:03,147
you wanted,

226
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:04,906
Mr. Chu?

227
00:15:16,747 --> 00:15:18,027
You don't deserve to get wasted.

228
00:15:20,147 --> 00:15:22,066
Stay sober and atone for this.

229
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:31,146
This is

230
00:15:31,627 --> 00:15:32,786
to honor the fallen soldiers.

231
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:45,666
(Zilan, you're smart and diligent.)

232
00:15:45,826 --> 00:15:47,267
You will earn scholarly honors.

233
00:15:49,507 --> 00:15:50,467
When you grow up,

234
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,867
you'll become a good
and respectable official.

235
00:15:53,706 --> 00:15:56,066
(Then no one will
dare bully you anymore.)

236
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:02,626
Mother.

237
00:16:02,747 --> 00:16:04,027
Don't cry, Zilan.

238
00:16:04,586 --> 00:16:05,867
I'm just tired.

239
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,347
My poor son.

240
00:16:10,467 --> 00:16:13,666
(Mother, I'll take you away
from the Chu family.)

241
00:16:14,467 --> 00:16:17,027
We don't have to endure their insult.

242
00:16:20,627 --> 00:16:21,467
Mother.

243
00:16:21,946 --> 00:16:23,186
Mother!

244
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:25,627
(I only fear)

245
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:28,786
you'll end up alone.

246
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:32,426
From now on,

247
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:34,627
stop pushing yourself so hard.

248
00:16:36,507 --> 00:16:38,227
Spare yourself.

widespread suffering,

and ministers had been united,

with generals defending Wei,

I was wrong.

276
00:18:12,987 --> 00:18:13,907
It's Mingshui.

277
00:18:14,187 --> 00:18:15,386
After losing in Huayuan,

278
00:18:15,546 --> 00:18:16,947
Wutuo sent more troops to Mingshui.

279
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:18,467
Their troops from Huayuan

280
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:19,947
are already advancing there.

281
00:18:20,947 --> 00:18:22,227
The Xiao Army can't

282
00:18:22,626 --> 00:18:24,267
resist much longer with weak forces.

283
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:26,467
We must reinforce them!

284
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,906
Mr. Jiang, you stay here.

285
00:18:29,146 --> 00:18:31,426

in defending Huayuan.

286

Vice Director of the Secretariat,

337
00:24:46,146 --> 00:24:47,907
prioritized personal desires

338
00:24:47,907 --> 00:24:49,227
and sowed discord repeatedly,

339
00:24:49,826 --> 00:24:51,866
making the military strength divided,

340
00:24:52,146 --> 00:24:54,626
allowing Wutuo's invasion.

341
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:56,386
War reignited,

342
00:24:56,467 --> 00:24:58,146
causing immense suffering.

343
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:01,066
He is hereby dismissed

344
00:25:01,306 --> 00:25:02,907
and exiled to the borderlands

345
00:25:03,187 --> 00:25:04,786
and will never return.

346
00:25:05,267 --> 00:25:06,907
By Imperial Decree.

347
00:25:08,826 --> 00:25:09,907
Thanks for your hard work.

348
00:25:10,507 --> 00:25:11,347
Rise, please.

349
00:25:11,866 --> 00:25:12,786
Thank you.

350
00:25:17,947 --> 00:25:18,787
Your Majesty.

351
00:25:19,066 --> 00:25:19,947
Amidst urgent warfare,

352
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,826
I prioritized military necessity,

353
00:25:22,227 --> 00:25:23,067
leaving Rundu

354
00:25:23,346 --> 00:25:24,187
without permission.

355
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:26,427
This defied imperial orders.

356
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:27,947
I deserve punishment.

357
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:29,867
Your Majesty.

358
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:32,626
General Feihong
contributed to the victory.

359
00:25:32,786 --> 00:25:33,826
She committed no crime.

360
00:25:35,546 --> 00:25:36,386
Good judgment.

361
00:25:36,907 --> 00:25:37,747
Xiao Jue, you also

362
00:25:37,826 --> 00:25:38,947
contributed to the victory.

363
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:40,146
Rewards for you both

364
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:41,707
have been sent to your mansions.

365
00:25:42,027 --> 00:25:42,867
Well,

366
00:25:43,386 --> 00:25:44,667
you may leave.

367
00:25:45,747 --> 00:25:47,106
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

368
00:26:03,826 --> 00:26:04,666
Yan He.

369
00:26:07,586 --> 00:26:08,707
Actually,

370
00:26:09,586 --> 00:26:10,667
when I married you,

371
00:26:12,306 --> 00:26:13,146
I knew

372
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:16,907
this day might come.

373
00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:20,507
But I never expected

374
00:26:22,386 --> 00:26:23,747
that it'd happen so soon.

375
00:26:32,907 --> 00:26:33,866
But don't worry.

376
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,467
Since I've married you,

377
00:26:36,786 --> 00:26:38,027
I'll never regret it.

378
00:26:40,947 --> 00:26:42,027
No matter how difficult,

379
00:26:43,987 --> 00:26:45,306
I'll live on resolutely

380
00:26:49,626 --> 00:26:51,346
and raise our child well.

381
00:27:04,386 --> 00:27:05,226

382
00:27:06,786 --> 00:27:07,626
Muxia.

383
00:27:07,987 --> 00:27:09,507
May you grow up healthy.

384
00:27:10,786 --> 00:27:12,027
Your father

385
00:27:12,626 --> 00:27:14,427
will surely watch over you.

386
00:28:07,507 --> 00:28:08,347
Careful!

387
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:11,346
Slow down!

388
00:28:20,747 --> 00:28:22,267
Soldiers fight on the battlefield

389
00:28:22,707 --> 00:28:24,427
for this peaceful life.

390
00:28:25,386 --> 00:28:26,306
If Yan He

391
00:28:26,546 --> 00:28:27,386
could see this,

392
00:28:28,027 --> 00:28:29,427
he might rest in peace.

393
00:28:30,747 --> 00:28:31,587
Sadly,

394
00:28:32,187 --> 00:28:33,187
he and Chengxiu

395
00:28:33,947 --> 00:28:35,187
are already separated by death.

396
00:28:37,987 --> 00:28:38,827
Huaijin,

397
00:28:39,626 --> 00:28:40,507
we promised each other

398
00:28:41,227 --> 00:28:42,067
to face the future

399
00:28:42,427 --> 00:28:43,947
and cherish every single day.

400
00:28:44,626 --> 00:28:45,466
Even if eventually...

401
00:28:45,546 --> 00:28:46,907
Even if one of us dies in battle,

402
00:28:47,786 --> 00:28:49,786
the other one must keep living
courageously

403
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:53,106
to see our nation's splendor and peace.

404
00:28:57,244 --> 00:29:00,872
(General Feihong's Mansion)

405
00:29:03,427 --> 00:29:04,826
This road feels too short.

406
00:29:05,306 --> 00:29:07,107
If only we could walk longer together.

407
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:08,466
We have time.

408
00:29:11,546 --> 00:29:12,667
I'll always stay with you.

409
00:29:14,267 --> 00:29:15,626
We live together when we're alive.

410
00:29:16,427 --> 00:29:17,267
After death, we'll be

411
00:29:17,987 --> 00:29:18,827
buried together.

412
00:29:22,066 --> 00:29:23,346
I'll give you a spot beside me.

413
00:29:26,546 --> 00:29:27,786
Who asked you to do that?

414
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,467
I'm the renowned General Feihong!

415
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:35,347
Well,

416
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:37,786
you keep a spot for me?

417
00:29:38,947 --> 00:29:39,787
You wish.

419
00:29:54,707 --> 00:29:55,547
Excuse me,

420
00:29:55,747 --> 00:29:56,707
if I may interject?

421
00:29:59,947 --> 00:30:01,106
Stop talking

422
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:02,227
about the spot.

423
00:30:02,786 --> 00:30:03,907
An imperial edict arrived.

424
00:30:04,027 --> 00:30:04,867
Come and take it.

425
00:30:09,586 --> 00:30:13,267
(General Feihong's Mansion)
By Heaven's Mandate,

426
00:30:13,707 --> 00:30:16,187
Xiao Jue, General Fengyun,

427
00:30:16,866 --> 00:30:20,106

Both are loyal generals

431
00:30:29,346 --> 00:30:30,987

432
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:33,507
I hereby grant you marriage.

433
00:30:33,747 --> 00:30:36,427
May you two stay together happily

434
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:40,187
and guard borders and people together.

435
00:30:40,427 --> 00:30:42,306
That's all!

436
00:30:45,146 --> 00:30:46,866
