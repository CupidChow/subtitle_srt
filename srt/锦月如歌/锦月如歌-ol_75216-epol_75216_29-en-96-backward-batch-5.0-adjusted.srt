00:01:43,528 --> 00:01:44,384
Right.

24
00:01:45,168 --> 00:01:46,489
Now that we're in the capital,

25
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:50,528
it's do or die.

26
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:55,168
(Yuzun Pavilion)

27
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,200
Mr. He.

28
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:12,000
You're here.

29
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:13,289
Mr. Chu.

30
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:14,144
What a coincidence.

31
00:02:16,248 --> 00:02:17,769
Is this a gift for someone?

32
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:19,489
Exactly.

33
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:20,968
I'm staying at the Xiao Mansion.

34
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:22,329
This is for Mr. Xiao

35
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:23,232
and his wife.

36
00:02:23,568 --> 00:02:24,408
(This person)

37
00:02:24,408 --> 00:02:25,609
(looks very familiar.)

38
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,289
(She resembles the woman
in the painting.)

39
00:02:35,712 --> 00:02:37,489
Mr. Chu, who is this lady?

40
00:02:38,688 --> 00:02:39,648
Well...

41
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:40,929
Who are you?

42
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:42,368
Are you close with Zilan?

43
00:02:44,088 --> 00:02:44,960
I'm He Yan,

44
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:46,209
a friend of Mr. Chu.

45
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:50,688
Mr. Chu,

46
00:02:50,688 --> 00:02:51,528
I'll take my leave.

47
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:53,376
See you.

48
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:02,336
(Ganming Pavilion)

49
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:06,329
Yuzun Pavilion, right?

50
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:08,192
Let's go.

51
00:03:10,912 --> 00:03:14,848
(Yuzun Pavilion)

52
00:03:15,408 --> 00:03:16,248
(It seems)

53
00:03:16,688 --> 00:03:18,248
(Chu Zhao is interested)

54
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:19,528
(in He Yan.)

55
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:21,729
(I wonder)

56
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:23,648
(how Miss Xu will react)

57
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:25,009
(when she finds out?)

58
00:03:25,107 --> 00:03:27,040
(Xu Mansion)

59
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:34,752
Miss Xu.

60
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:40,769
You seem

61
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:41,968
upset.

62
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:45,088
What's it to you?

63
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:48,929
Have you heard the story

64
00:03:49,248 --> 00:03:51,209
about the female general of Jiyang?

65
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:54,929
Female general of Jiyang?

66
00:03:56,192 --> 00:03:57,128
Never mind.

67
00:03:57,128 --> 00:03:58,128
You showed such

68
00:03:58,289 --> 00:03:59,889
refreshing honesty earlier.

69
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,432
Had you taken up sword and service,

70
00:04:01,432 --> 00:04:02,272
history would

71
00:04:02,272 --> 00:04:04,169
remember you as renowned
as that female general.

72
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:06,449
Haven't you heard, Miss Xu?

73
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:07,929
The female general He Yan

74
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:09,248
achieved remarkable feats

75
00:04:09,368 --> 00:04:10,329
in the battle of Jiyang,

76
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:11,409
defending the city.

77
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:13,289
She is a role model for women.

78
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:16,089
By the way,
she's just returned to Yaojing.

79
00:04:17,248 --> 00:04:18,208
He Yan?

80
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:24,000
Mr. He.

81
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:26,240
You're here.

82
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:27,768
What a coincidence, Mr. Chu.

83
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:29,609
He Yan

84
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:31,328
is actually a woman?

85
00:04:31,456 --> 00:04:32,448
Correct.

86
00:04:32,448 --> 00:04:34,248
She's a good female general.

87
00:04:34,592 --> 00:04:35,529
I hear

88
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:36,729
that even Mr. Chu

89
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:38,609
holds her in high regard.

90
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:40,328
Though

91
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:41,248
whispers of her serving

92
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:42,268
in the army cross-dressed

93
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,208
have reached the common folk,

94
00:04:44,568 --> 00:04:46,448
it remains unknown to His Majesty.

95
00:04:46,808 --> 00:04:47,929
His Majesty even made her

96
00:04:48,368 --> 00:04:49,408
Attendant Wu'an.

97
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:51,448
Who knows

98
00:04:51,448 --> 00:04:52,448
what will happen

99
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:53,609
to He Yan

100
00:04:53,929 --> 00:04:54,808
if His Majesty

101
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:56,169
discovers the truth?

102
00:05:00,609 --> 00:05:01,728
Naturally,

103
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,049
it's a capital offense.

104
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:14,336
Hey!

105
00:05:14,888 --> 00:05:15,968
Are you zoning out?

106
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,128
General Yan.

107
00:05:25,128 --> 00:05:26,969
I am glad to see you.

108
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:28,208
Please.

109
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,216
Sit and drink with me.

110
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:41,049
You treat He Yan quite specially.

111
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:42,929
I came to see you,

112
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:44,609
yet you didn't even pour me liquor?

113
00:05:45,248 --> 00:05:46,208
You have hands.

114
00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:47,289
I do have hands.

115
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:48,320
But he doesn't?

116
00:05:58,568 --> 00:05:59,424
It's chilly.

117
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:02,248
I'll fetch you a coat.

118
00:06:07,888 --> 00:06:08,849
I'm just saying.

119
00:06:09,609 --> 00:06:10,880
Why did he take it seriously?

120
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:12,688
Actually,

121
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:13,536
all these years,

122
00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:15,409
he's only shown concerns

123
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:16,416
about He Rufei.

124
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:17,649
But now,

125
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:18,609
he cares about you too.

126
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:20,529
You seem

127
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:22,128
slightly better than He Rufei.

128
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,969
But don't go doing the things he did.

129
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:26,688
He cares about He Rufei?

130
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,169
You might not believe this.

131
00:06:29,808 --> 00:06:30,808
Xiao Jue

132
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,609
painstakingly taught General Feihong

133
00:06:32,888 --> 00:06:34,289
Qinglang Sword Style

134
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:35,360
day after day.

135
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:36,849
How is that possible?

136
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:38,089
Why wouldn't it be?

137
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:39,568
I saw it with my own eyes.

138
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:50,929
No, like this?

139
00:07:13,328 --> 00:07:14,289
Xiao Jue,

140
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:15,248
you're secretly standing

141
00:07:15,888 --> 00:07:16,969
outside He Rufei's room

142
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,289
just to teach a fool swordsmanship?

143
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:20,969
You secretly followed me

144
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,328
just to watch me

145
00:07:22,328 --> 00:07:23,248
coach a fool?

146
00:07:23,448 --> 00:07:24,808
T-That's not the same.

147
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:26,368
Have you lost your mind?

148
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:28,049
Why waste time on a fool

149
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:28,960
like him?

150
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:34,489
Are you even listening to me?

151
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:35,849
Why bother

152
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:36,768
with a fool?

153
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:38,849
I don't consider it a waste of time.

154
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:40,888
You coach him daily,

155
00:07:41,088 --> 00:07:42,049
yet his progress

156
00:07:42,049 --> 00:07:43,208
is barely noticeable.

157
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:45,328
He gets help from a top student,

158
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:46,529
yet he remains mediocre.

159
00:07:47,328 --> 00:07:48,289
It's laughable.

160
00:07:49,248 --> 00:07:50,289
I'll go tell him right now

161
00:07:50,768 --> 00:07:51,969
that if he's got no talent,

162
00:07:52,328 --> 00:07:53,489
he shouldn't waste your time.

163
00:07:53,888 --> 00:07:54,816
Let's fight a duel.

164
00:07:57,808 --> 00:07:59,248
I once tried so hard to force him

165
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,768
to accept my challenge.

166
00:08:00,768 --> 00:08:02,089
Yet he always refused.

167
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:03,609
But he agreed

168
00:08:03,768 --> 00:08:04,649
because I promised

169
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:06,688
to keep it a secret

170
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:08,192
from the ingrate He Rufei.

171
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:09,888
Can you believe it?

172
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:13,208
Xiao Jue must be blind.

173
00:08:14,008 --> 00:08:15,368
Each one at Xianchang Academy

174
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:18,609
is better than He Rufei,

175
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:20,128
an ungrateful wretch.

176
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:44,800
So that's how these

177
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,368
Qinglang Sword Style techniques work.

178
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:49,328
Who kindly

179
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,929
left these notes to me?

180
00:08:55,648 --> 00:08:56,512
(Feet still. Reverse sword spin.
Sweep waist, thrust left)

181
00:09:00,704 --> 00:09:01,600
(Feet planted, turn left,
step right into bow stance)

182
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:14,369
There's more.

183
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:17,249
Once during archery class,

184
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:18,889
He Rufei forgot his thumb ring.

185
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:19,769
Xiao Jue

186
00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:20,889
gave his own spare

187
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:21,808
(to He Rufei.)

188
00:09:24,968 --> 00:09:26,016
Where's my thumb ring?

189
00:09:55,848 --> 00:09:56,848
Size doesn't matter.

190
00:09:56,848 --> 00:09:57,728
Better than nothing.

191
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,529
Are you even listening to me?

192
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:08,769
What took Xiao Jue

193
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:10,568
so long?

194
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:12,169
Whatever.

195
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:13,369
My wife is waiting for me.

196
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:14,976
I'm leaving.

197
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,129
So, that's how it was.

198
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:57,289
What is inside?

199
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:12,889
(You left a letter)

200
00:11:13,448 --> 00:11:14,289
and a pouch,

201
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:15,289
and then disappeared.

202
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:17,369
What's that about?

203
00:11:21,688 --> 00:11:22,592
What?

204
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,208
You left something else?

205
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:26,048
Nothing else.

206
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:52,688
Yan He couldn't wait

207
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,272
and left.

208
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:57,888
It's okay.

209
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:02,328
Put your cloak on.

210
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:10,249
All these days,

211
00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:13,688
it's been like walking through darkness

212
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,009
alone.

213
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:19,769
No one noticed my existence.

214
00:12:21,488 --> 00:12:22,560
No one cared about

215
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,088
my joys or sorrows.

216
00:12:25,968 --> 00:12:27,169
No cheers,

217
00:12:28,568 --> 00:12:29,769
and no apologies.

218
00:12:31,369 --> 00:12:32,649
Happiness or grief,

219
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:35,448
beginnings or endings,

220
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,488
it was a story about a lonely person.

221
00:12:43,688 --> 00:12:44,688
Until one day,

222
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:48,129
someone saw me.

223
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,409
(Back at Xianchang Academy,)

224
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:53,920
(the one secretly
teaching me swordsmanship)

225
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:56,032
was you.

226
00:12:57,328 --> 00:12:58,728
(The one who lent me a thumb ring)

227
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:01,888
was also you.

228
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:03,769
Why were you so kind to me?

229
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:05,929
Back then,

230
00:13:07,608 --> 00:13:08,512
(I was timid)

231
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:10,560
(and felt inferior.)

232
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:13,129
(Nobody respected me.)

233
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:21,088
To be honest,

234
00:13:22,608 --> 00:13:24,728
at first, I did look down on you.

235
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:27,529
But you are so tenacious

236
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:28,889
and stubborn.

237
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,889
You never give up on yourself.

238
00:13:33,728 --> 00:13:34,848
Perhaps our situations

239
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:35,769
are too similar.

240
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,049
At such a young age,

241
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:40,369
we chose

242
00:13:40,369 --> 00:13:41,688
to shoulder the family's burdens.

243
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:44,448
My life

244
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,409
was also once low-point.

245
00:13:46,448 --> 00:13:47,409
Sometimes,

246
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:49,608
I felt helpless.

247
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:52,929
That's why whenever I saw you

248
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:53,769
practicing alone

249
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:55,688
so hard,

250
00:13:58,249 --> 00:13:59,808
I saw myself reflected in you.

251
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:02,409
I couldn't help but want

252
00:14:03,088 --> 00:14:03,968
to be kind to you.

253
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:06,289
It felt like

254
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:10,088
compensating for my younger self.

255
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:16,032
Look.

256
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:18,049
Tonight's moon

257
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,409
is so beautiful.

258
00:14:46,088 --> 00:14:47,072
Are you

259
00:14:47,488 --> 00:14:48,889
returning this to me

260
00:14:49,328 --> 00:14:50,409
because it looks ugly?

261
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:02,328
You noticed.

262
00:15:05,728 --> 00:15:07,169
It looks terrible.

263
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:17,968
I wish to be like the bright moon,

264
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:19,568
guarding you forever.

265
00:15:20,627 --> 00:15:22,035
(Rundu is in peril. I'm going to help.
I need your sword.)

♪Walking through the crowd,

00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:35,769
it breaks my heart.

269
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:38,208
Go on.

270
00:15:39,008 --> 00:15:40,049
You and I met

271
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:41,249
in a former life.

272
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:47,169
I was once a female general.

273
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:49,216
I thought

274
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,448
you'd say "I will be."

275
00:15:51,608 --> 00:15:52,608
The last secret.

276
00:15:57,009 --> 00:15:58,049
I love the moon.

277
00:15:58,808 --> 00:16:00,009
Yet the moon doesn't know.

279
00:16:09,328 --> 00:16:10,448

280
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:13,216
Yes.

Now,

285
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:36,169
the moon belongs to you.

286
00:16:39,872 --> 00:16:41,929
You're the first one
I taught swordsmanship to.

287
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:45,728
(You're the first one
I tended wounds to.)

288
00:16:47,584 --> 00:16:49,184
(You're the first one I gave candy to.)

289
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:52,808
(You're the first one)

290
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,168
(I bought clothes for.)

291
00:16:59,528 --> 00:17:01,048
You're the first girl

292
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:03,168
I tried to comfort.

293
00:17:05,048 --> 00:17:06,688
(You're the first one)

294
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:08,832
(I covered for.)

295
00:17:12,968 --> 00:17:14,008
Finally, I realize

296
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:17,440
that in my life,

297
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:19,169
the only person I love

298
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:23,288
is you.

305

Since Xiao Jue and your sister

306
00:18:09,248 --> 00:18:11,569
already suspect you,

307
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:14,609
they'll maintain high alert

308
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:18,369
during the return to the capital.

309
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:19,849
Our failure this time

310
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:22,409
was expected.

311
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:24,768
Chancellor.

312
00:18:24,768 --> 00:18:25,849
What's our next move?

313
00:18:26,176 --> 00:18:27,089
Perhaps

314
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:28,728
we strike first

315
00:18:28,896 --> 00:18:30,106
before they meet His Majesty.

316
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,288
Our earlier failure

317
00:18:32,968 --> 00:18:35,768
means we've lost the best chance.

318
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,968
You must stay calm now.

319
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:40,768
Currently,

320
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:42,929
their biggest obstacle

321
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:44,809
is a lack of evidence.

322
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,569
So,

323
00:18:46,569 --> 00:18:49,008
you shouldn't act rashly,

324
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,129
avoiding giving them leverage.

325
00:18:51,728 --> 00:18:53,609
I can't keep calm, Chancellor.

326
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:55,208
They're coming to the capital

327
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,089
to find evidence.

328
00:18:56,248 --> 00:18:57,649
Are we just doing nothing?

329
00:18:57,768 --> 00:18:59,889
There's a prerequisite

330
00:19:00,048 --> 00:19:02,048
that the evidence exists.

331
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:08,728
Did you

332
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:13,488
leave any trace of what we did?

333
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,456
Chancellor.

334
00:19:16,528 --> 00:19:17,448
He Yan and I

335
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:19,129
cannot coexist in this world.

336
00:19:19,528 --> 00:19:20,369
Therefore,

337
00:19:20,768 --> 00:19:22,048
since I worked with you,

338
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:24,768
I've held nothing back from you.

339
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,968
Tonight's Mid-Autumn banquet

340
00:19:55,248 --> 00:19:56,609
marks the beginning.

341
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:58,912
I will

342
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:01,809
settle things clearly

343
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:04,649
with He Rufei.

344
00:20:25,248 --> 00:20:26,304
Huaijin.

345
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:27,712
Are you ready?

346
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:29,089
I've been waiting

347
00:20:30,248 --> 00:20:31,609
so long for this.

348
00:20:53,968 --> 00:20:54,809
I guess

349
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:57,169
this must be

350
00:20:58,129 --> 00:20:59,288
He Rufei, the renowned

351
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:00,609
General Feihong.

352
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,409
I am He Yan,

353
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:11,369
Attendant Wu'an.

354
00:21:17,448 --> 00:21:18,288
General Feihong,

355
00:21:18,288 --> 00:21:19,528
are you feeling unwell?

356
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,448
You should stay at Yuhua Temple

357
00:21:22,488 --> 00:21:23,329
for your health.

358
00:21:23,688 --> 00:21:25,048
Its location is excellent.

359
00:21:25,488 --> 00:21:27,169
It's ideal for physical recuperation.

360
00:21:31,048 --> 00:21:32,809
You're just second-rate.

361
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:34,208
I won't

362
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,008
stoop to your level.

363
00:21:36,248 --> 00:21:37,129
Second-rate?

364
00:21:39,768 --> 00:21:40,768
His Majesty made He Yan

365
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:41,849
Attendant Wu'an.

366
00:21:42,649 --> 00:21:43,968
Are you

367
00:21:44,768 --> 00:21:46,488
questioning His Majesty's judgment?

368
00:21:57,768 --> 00:21:58,968
Take it one step at a time.

369
00:21:59,136 --> 00:22:00,409
- Right?
- Sure.

370
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:01,809
That makes sense.

371
00:22:07,048 --> 00:22:08,000
Huaijin.

372
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:09,688
Why does Mr. Yang seem

373
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:11,288
to hate you?

374
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:13,008
Back in Chonghuai,

375
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,728
I heard from Yang Mingzhi

376
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:16,329
about your conflict with Mr. Yang.

377
00:22:17,488 --> 00:22:18,768
It puzzled me greatly back then.

378
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:20,889
I've long heard

379
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,609
that Mr. Yang, Minister of War,

380
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:24,048
is upright

381
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:25,409
and loyal to His Majesty.

382
00:22:25,768 --> 00:22:27,488
How could he ally with Xu Jingfu?

383
00:22:28,008 --> 00:22:29,089
Once in a morning meeting,

384
00:22:29,688 --> 00:22:30,929
Mr. Yang's aggressive stance

385
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:32,849
incensed me.

386
00:22:33,688 --> 00:22:34,649
But upon reflection,

387
00:22:35,169 --> 00:22:36,169
I think he is

388
00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:37,280
excessively upright.

389
00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:38,368
He sees the world

390
00:22:38,528 --> 00:22:39,569
in black and white.

391
00:22:40,688 --> 00:22:41,536
So,

392
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:42,849
Xu Jingfu

393
00:22:42,849 --> 00:22:43,809
used him

394
00:22:45,089 --> 00:22:46,288
as a pawn against others.

395
00:23:06,688 --> 00:23:07,849
Mr. Liu, cheers.

396
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:10,329
Cheers.

397
00:23:10,528 --> 00:23:11,369
Let's drink.

398
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:12,384
Let's drink.

399
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:17,376
Let's drink.

400
00:23:30,592 --> 00:23:31,569
Drink.

401
00:23:31,569 --> 00:23:32,512
Drink.

402
00:23:49,849 --> 00:23:50,720
Drink.

403
00:23:52,704 --> 00:23:53,609
To you.

404
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:54,592
To you.

405
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:03,688
- Excellent.
- Excellent.

406
00:24:06,176 --> 00:24:07,129
Splendid.

407
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:08,329
The dance was superb.

408
00:24:09,369 --> 00:24:10,728
Is Attendant Wu'an present?

409
00:24:20,768 --> 00:24:21,649
I, He Yan,

410
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:25,008
pay respects, Your Majesty.

411
00:24:26,688 --> 00:24:27,680
Rise.

412
00:24:28,288 --> 00:24:29,344
Thank you, Your Majesty.

413
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,488
Attendant Wu'an,

414
00:24:32,488 --> 00:24:33,488
you raided enemies

415
00:24:33,528 --> 00:24:34,609
at night,

416
00:24:34,728 --> 00:24:35,728
burned their granaries,

417
00:24:35,968 --> 00:24:36,809
and defeated Wutuo

418
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,169
in Rundu.

419
00:24:38,488 --> 00:24:39,889
I've heard much about your feats.

420
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:41,129
You are

421
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:43,849
a capable young man.

422
00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:45,809
Thank you.

423
00:24:46,288 --> 00:24:47,528
The credit belongs to all.

424
00:24:48,448 --> 00:24:49,329
The victory in Rundu

425
00:24:49,569 --> 00:24:51,649
depended on civilians and soldiers.

426
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:53,062
With the help

427
00:24:53,062 --> 00:24:54,432
of Commander Xiao and General Yan,

428
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:55,968
we won.

429
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:57,688
You're very humble.

430
00:24:58,488 --> 00:24:59,328
Good!

431
00:25:00,889 --> 00:25:01,920
Minister Xiao.

432
00:25:02,288 --> 00:25:04,089
You trained a good soldier.

433
00:25:09,488 --> 00:25:10,329
Thank you.

434
00:25:11,008 --> 00:25:12,929
I simply employed standard drills

435
00:25:12,968 --> 00:25:13,888
for military training.

436
00:25:14,688 --> 00:25:15,768
His achievements stem

437
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:17,849
from exceptional dedication.

438
00:25:18,528 --> 00:25:19,409
He has

439
00:25:19,448 --> 00:25:20,288
worked so hard.

440
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:24,160
Attendant Wu'an,

441
00:25:24,488 --> 00:25:25,528
I'm curious

442
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:27,208
about one thing.

443
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,169
Since you serve under Commander Xiao,

444
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:30,649
why didn't you impersonate him,

445
00:25:30,649 --> 00:25:32,129
a man you know better,

446
00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:33,688
instead of General He?

447
00:25:34,528 --> 00:25:36,288
After all, General Fengyun

448
00:25:36,649 --> 00:25:37,528
is as famous as

449
00:25:37,528 --> 00:25:38,768
General Feihong.

450
00:25:44,768 --> 00:25:45,792
Your Majesty.

451
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,369
If I pretend to be General Fengyun,

452
00:25:49,768 --> 00:25:50,609
my face will

453
00:25:50,768 --> 00:25:52,089
immediately give me away.

454
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:55,208
But General Feihong

455
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,889
always wore a mask in the past.

456
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:00,089
Few have seen his true appearance.

457
00:26:01,008 --> 00:26:02,144
Thus, impersonating him

458
00:26:02,288 --> 00:26:04,008
is naturally easier.

459
00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:06,448
That's how I could

460
00:26:06,569 --> 00:26:08,208
leverage General Feihong's reputation

461
00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:09,488
to intimidate the Wutuo.

462
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:11,048
That sounds reasonable.

463
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:12,968
It seems

464
00:26:12,968 --> 00:26:13,889
I ignored details.

465
00:26:15,248 --> 00:26:16,128
Speaking of which,

466
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:17,968
you should thank General He.

467
00:26:24,048 --> 00:26:25,024
Your Majesty.

468
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:27,968
General He comes from a noble family.

469
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:29,809
I don't dare to make a connection
with him.

470
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,089
Nevertheless, I must indeed

471
00:26:33,488 --> 00:26:35,849
express my gratitude to General He.

472
00:26:42,129 --> 00:26:43,248
Thank you, General He.

473
00:26:44,288 --> 00:26:45,609
I am

474
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,208
very grateful to you.

475
00:27:00,889 --> 00:27:01,856
Your Majesty.

476
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:05,409
I hold General He in high esteem.

477
00:27:05,569 --> 00:27:07,488
Now that I've finally met him

478
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:09,409
at this Mid-Autumn banquet,

479
00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:12,369
I wish to spar

480
00:27:12,688 --> 00:27:13,889
with General He

481
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:16,048
to enliven the celebration for all.

482
00:27:16,528 --> 00:27:18,248
May Your Majesty grant my request.

483
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:27,409
Challenge General Feihong?

484
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:29,089
He is so overconfident!

485
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:30,112
Exactly.

486
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:38,169
His Majesty just praised your humility,

487
00:27:38,528 --> 00:27:39,728
and now you're getting cocky.

488
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:42,488
A bad general

489
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:43,728
makes a bad soldier.

490
00:27:44,928 --> 00:27:45,968
Mr. Yang,

491
00:27:45,968 --> 00:27:47,488
that's a little judgmental.

492
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,288
To match General Feihong's prowess,

493
00:27:50,688 --> 00:27:52,208
I've practiced martial arts

494
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:53,649
relentlessly.

495
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:04,608
Your Majesty.

496
00:28:05,048 --> 00:28:06,008
This Mid-Autumn Festival

497
00:28:06,288 --> 00:28:08,129
is a time for peace and joy.

498
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:09,448
A fight game

499
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:11,488
seems inappropriate.

500
00:28:17,008 --> 00:28:18,112
General He.

501
00:28:18,592 --> 00:28:19,488
Attendant Wu'an

502
00:28:19,488 --> 00:28:20,768
is awaiting His Majesty's reply.

503
00:28:21,528 --> 00:28:22,768
Before His Majesty speaks,

504
00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:25,728
why did you rush to decline?

505
00:28:32,688 --> 00:28:33,728
Your Majesty.

506
00:28:35,488 --> 00:28:37,048
I think

507
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:39,649
General He made a fair point.

508
00:28:40,008 --> 00:28:42,929
A fight before Your Majesty

509
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:45,688
is indeed improper.

510
00:28:46,968 --> 00:28:48,288
It's just to add to the fun.

511
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:49,929
When I

512
00:28:49,968 --> 00:28:50,968
was Crown Prince,

513
00:28:50,968 --> 00:28:52,169
I often sparred

514
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:53,889
with soldiers.

515
00:28:55,409 --> 00:28:57,089
Both of you know what to do.

516
00:28:57,889 --> 00:28:59,569
Don't hurt each other.

517
00:28:59,968 --> 00:29:01,569
- As Your Majesty commands.
- As Your Majesty commands.

518
00:29:08,768 --> 00:29:09,856
Use this sword.

519
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:29,688
The Qinglang Sword

520
00:29:29,688 --> 00:29:30,968
is General Feihong's sword.

521
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:33,248
Why is Attendant Wu'an

522
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:34,929
holding it?

523
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:36,649
So strange.

524
00:29:37,288 --> 00:29:38,144
Attendant Wu'an.

525
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:40,089
Why hesitate?

526
00:29:40,569 --> 00:29:41,528
If you fear losing,

527
00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:43,809
surrender now.

528
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:46,248
Bring it on, General He.

529
00:30:21,849 --> 00:30:22,752
Incredible!

530
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,369
General Feihong is defeated?

531
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:25,048
How is this possible?

532
00:31:34,451 --> 00:31:35,744
It's so...

533
00:31:42,728 --> 00:31:43,728
Your Majesty.

534
00:31:43,728 --> 00:31:44,688
I'm done.

535
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,560
Impressive.

536
00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:53,984
He Rufei.

537
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,849
You wish me dead, right?

538
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:57,288
I'll take your life

539
00:31:57,688 --> 00:31:58,809
like a vengeful ghost.

540
00:32:00,728 --> 00:32:01,632
He Yan!

541
00:32:03,448 --> 00:32:04,352
General He.

542
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:05,809
Stop shouting here.

543
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:07,248
You can't stand to lose?

544
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:12,089
Your Majesty, forgive me.

545
00:32:12,089 --> 00:32:13,248
That's not true.

546
00:32:13,609 --> 00:32:14,528
I...

547
00:32:14,528 --> 00:32:15,456
I...

548
00:32:20,048 --> 00:32:21,120
Your Majesty.

549
00:32:22,048 --> 00:32:23,208
People say

550
00:32:23,329 --> 00:32:24,609
martial artists

551
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,129
are all proud.

552
00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:29,089
General He's martial skills
are unmatched.

553
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:31,488
If he hadn't been injured

554
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:32,704
in the Huayuan Battle

555
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:34,929
or had recovered,

556
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:36,809
he never

557
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:38,649
would've lost.

558
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:41,728
General He is too young

559
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:43,609
to accept this outcome.

560
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:46,208
That's understandable.

561
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:47,409
Actually,

562
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:49,809
this outcome

563
00:32:50,089 --> 00:32:51,448
means little.

564
00:32:52,008 --> 00:32:54,889
So long as Your Majesty and officials

565
00:32:55,129 --> 00:32:56,488
find enjoyment,

566
00:32:57,089 --> 00:33:00,208
it would be great.

567
00:33:02,929 --> 00:33:04,000
Attendant Wu'an.

568
00:33:04,569 --> 00:33:05,688
At such a young age,

569
00:33:05,889 --> 00:33:07,528
you show remarkable courage and wisdom,

570
00:33:08,048 --> 00:33:08,968
making you

571
00:33:09,008 --> 00:33:10,609
a good soldier.

572
00:33:17,968 --> 00:33:19,768
- Congratulations, Your Majesty,
- Congratulations, Your Majesty,

573
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,089
- on acquiring an exceptional soldier.
- on acquiring an exceptional soldier.

574
00:33:28,288 --> 00:33:32,728
The Empress came with noblewomen
to propose a toast.

575
00:33:42,003 --> 00:33:44,480
(Princess of Wei, Empress of Wei)

576
00:34:01,889 --> 00:34:03,329
- I wish Your Majesty
- I wish Father

577
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,168
- happiness.
- happiness.

578
00:34:05,488 --> 00:34:08,008
- May Wei lasting peace!
- May Wei lasting peace!

579
00:34:08,769 --> 00:34:09,664
Rise.

580
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:11,369
Thank you, Your Majesty.

581
00:34:23,488 --> 00:34:25,168
- We wish Your Majesty
- We wish Your Majesty

582
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:27,088
- happiness.
- happiness.

583
00:34:27,289 --> 00:34:30,128
- May Wei lasting peace!
- May Wei lasting peace!

584
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:40,809
Please sit.

585
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:55,249
(She's a good female general.)

586
00:34:55,809 --> 00:34:57,608
(I hear that even Mr. Chu)

587
00:34:57,809 --> 00:34:59,608
(holds her in high regard.)

588
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:16,928
Pingting.

589
00:35:17,608 --> 00:35:19,409
Mind your manners before His Majesty.

590
00:35:23,168 --> 00:35:24,192
Your Majesty,

591
00:35:24,648 --> 00:35:25,849
I have something to report.

592
00:35:29,729 --> 00:35:30,608
Your Majesty,

593
00:35:30,608 --> 00:35:31,608
I bring charges against

594
00:35:31,809 --> 00:35:32,849
He Yan of Yezhou Garrison.

595
00:35:38,608 --> 00:35:39,729
She disguised as a man

596
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,769
to join the army.
She's been deceiving you.

597
00:35:42,048 --> 00:35:43,289
Please punish her severely.

598
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,289
What?

599
00:35:45,289 --> 00:35:46,249
Disguised as a man?

600
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:49,472
Is that true?

601
00:35:50,968 --> 00:35:52,608
What? He Yan is female?

602
00:35:53,689 --> 00:35:54,849
This is deception.

603
00:35:54,849 --> 00:35:55,729
Exactly!

604
00:35:55,729 --> 00:35:57,648
This is deception!

605
00:35:57,849 --> 00:35:58,912
Yes.

606
00:35:59,088 --> 00:36:00,008
How's this possible?

607
00:36:01,008 --> 00:36:01,888
Who knows?

608
00:36:02,168 --> 00:36:03,008
Impossible.

609
00:36:04,528 --> 00:36:05,528
It's a capital offense.

610
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:08,088
It's insane.

611
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:10,848
Miss Xu,

612
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:12,849
before His Majesty,

613
00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:13,824
mind your words.

614
00:36:14,528 --> 00:36:15,392
Attendant Wu'an

615
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:17,048
couldn't possibly be female.

616
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:24,256
Your Majesty,

617
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:26,289
a body check will confirm

618
00:36:26,528 --> 00:36:27,448
my honesty.

619
00:36:29,648 --> 00:36:30,769
I just don't know

620
00:36:31,249 --> 00:36:32,409
if she dares to do that.

621
00:36:34,249 --> 00:36:35,168
Good idea.

622
00:36:36,096 --> 00:36:36,968
Do a body check.

623
00:36:36,968 --> 00:36:37,856
- Yes.
- Yes.

624
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:40,729
Minister Xiao.

625
00:36:40,729 --> 00:36:41,889
In your opinion,

626
00:36:42,088 --> 00:36:43,488
how should I handle this?

627
00:36:51,088 --> 00:36:52,128
Your Majesty,

628
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:53,312
I'm sorry

629
00:36:53,889 --> 00:36:55,128
for bothering you.

630
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:05,376
Actually,

631
00:37:06,088 --> 00:37:07,289
I've long been aware of this.

632
00:37:08,048 --> 00:37:09,056
What?

633
00:37:09,568 --> 00:37:11,088
Your Majesty knew it?

634
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:12,704
So, that's true.

635
00:37:17,856 --> 00:37:18,769
Yes.

636
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:19,840
Well...

637
00:37:20,689 --> 00:37:21,664
(When I was young,)

638
00:37:22,008 --> 00:37:23,008
I met a woman

639
00:37:23,209 --> 00:37:24,289
by chance.

640
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:26,304
To be honest,

641
00:37:26,648 --> 00:37:27,729
she has no talent

642
00:37:28,769 --> 00:37:30,088
for martial arts.

643
00:37:31,528 --> 00:37:32,568
Back then, I thought

644
00:37:32,648 --> 00:37:34,088
she was rather foolishly persistent,

645
00:37:35,008 --> 00:37:36,008
and she would give up

646
00:37:36,648 --> 00:37:37,968
after encountering some setbacks.

647
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:41,528
But to my surprise,

648
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:43,889
she persisted day after day

649
00:37:44,689 --> 00:37:46,409
and did it.

650
00:37:47,729 --> 00:37:48,929
I've never seen

651
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:51,088
such unyielding determination in anyone.

652
00:37:52,048 --> 00:37:53,289
She is like a steadfast tree

653
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,088
and as resilient as grass.

654
00:37:58,329 --> 00:37:59,769
She commanded my attention.

655
00:38:02,128 --> 00:38:03,040
Actually,

656
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:04,409
back then,

657
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:05,968
I didn't know how I felt about her.

658
00:38:06,488 --> 00:38:08,729
I was a little too harsh on her,

659
00:38:09,729 --> 00:38:11,209
giving her a strict teaching.

660
00:38:13,689 --> 00:38:14,624
I guess

661
00:38:14,968 --> 00:38:17,329
she must've hated me.

662
00:38:19,889 --> 00:38:20,769
Well,

663
00:38:22,048 --> 00:38:24,209
no wonder you remain solitary.

664
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:27,168
You frightened the girl away.

665
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:30,289
She didn't flee from my harshness.

666
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,160
However,

667
00:38:32,289 --> 00:38:33,568
misfortune struck her family.

668
00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:36,224
From then on,

669
00:38:37,409 --> 00:38:38,769
we were separated by distance

670
00:38:40,168 --> 00:38:41,128
and out of touch.

671
00:38:44,729 --> 00:38:45,889
Surprisingly, we met again

672
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:49,249
in Yezhou.

673
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:51,409
She was in trouble

674
00:38:52,168 --> 00:38:53,128
and helpless.

675
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:55,296
However,

676
00:38:56,576 --> 00:38:57,448
she

677
00:38:57,448 --> 00:38:58,568
remained indomitable

678
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:01,008
yet naive.

679
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:04,448
This reminded me vividly

680
00:39:05,088 --> 00:39:06,329
of our childhood friendship.

681
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:08,608
Childhood friendship?

682
00:39:10,008 --> 00:39:10,929
I don't think so.

683
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,329
You finally realized

684
00:39:13,929 --> 00:39:14,769
you had feelings

685
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:16,809
for that girl, right?

686
00:39:29,528 --> 00:39:30,528
You are right.

687
00:39:32,209 --> 00:39:33,128
After our separation,

688
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:34,168
I came to realize

689
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:37,409
that my feelings for her

690
00:39:39,249 --> 00:39:41,008
couldn't be forgotten.

691
00:39:51,729 --> 00:39:52,640
Your Majesty.

692
00:39:52,968 --> 00:39:54,608
I admired her exceptional abilities

693
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:56,648
and didn't want to part with her.

694
00:39:58,448 --> 00:39:59,849
So, I let her disguise as a man

695
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:01,729
to stay at Yezhou Garrison.

696
00:40:03,929 --> 00:40:04,928
Your Majesty.

697
00:40:05,448 --> 00:40:06,849
I offer my two military merits

698
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,008
to beg your forgiveness

699
00:40:08,008 --> 00:40:09,488
for my recklessness.

700
00:40:10,568 --> 00:40:11,648
I implore your approval.

701
00:40:21,249 --> 00:40:22,128
I granted the request

702
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,528
of Commander Xiao.

703
00:40:24,008 --> 00:40:25,008
So, Attendant Wu'an

704
00:40:25,209 --> 00:40:26,528
commits no act of deception.

705
00:40:27,209 --> 00:40:28,168
Moreover,

706
00:40:28,168 --> 00:40:29,329
I'm moved

707
00:40:29,568 --> 00:40:31,209
by Commander Xiao's love.

708
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:32,689
He is fully pardoned.

709
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,088
- Your Majesty is wise.
- Your Majesty is wise.

710
00:40:41,048 --> 00:40:42,528
Your Majesty is merciful

711
00:40:42,968 --> 00:40:46,249
and forgives their deception.

712
00:40:46,689 --> 00:40:48,729
Yet General Fengyun,

713
00:40:49,008 --> 00:40:51,128
as military commander,

714
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:53,729
deceived us all

715
00:40:53,809 --> 00:40:55,369
for personal reasons.

716
00:40:55,528 --> 00:40:58,209
It may

717
00:40:58,448 --> 00:40:59,929
disappoint the troops.

718
00:41:00,528 --> 00:41:02,008
That makes sense.

719
00:41:02,608 --> 00:41:03,448
If soldiers

720
00:41:03,448 --> 00:41:04,289
start following

721
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:05,409
this example

722
00:41:06,409 --> 00:41:07,889
and hide women in camp,

723
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:09,809
military order

724
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:10,729
will be ruined.
