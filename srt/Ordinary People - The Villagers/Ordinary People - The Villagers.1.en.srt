Amateur Boxing Association Dinner-7 PM

6
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,330
I'll lobby for your boxers,

7
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,630
so not a word...

8
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,510
Ki-chul's here.

9
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,870
Welcome.

10
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,350
What brings you to our dinner?

11
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,790
Why did you bring that?

12
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,270
Come sit down.

13
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,930
2nd Place

14
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,500
My student doesn't need this,

15
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,550
he's giving up boxing.

16
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,670
Why don't you sit down, we can talk.

17
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,710
Jeez, what a con man...

18
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,280
What? A con man?

19
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,810
Sir

20
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,910
my kids starve themselves
to train for this,

21
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,210
but you fix matches
like there's no tomorrow!

22
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:37,720
Buddy!

23
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,030
That worthless boxer really took
after his coach.

24
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,910
You'd be in jail if it wasn't for us.

25
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,350
How dare you talk so, you jerk!

26
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,480
Dude, that's enough...

27
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,170
Get lost!

28
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,070
Ki-chul, do you take me for a chump?

29
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,550
Come outside, come!

30
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,670
- Stop it!
- What's with you again?

31
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,470
Move aside, move!

32
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,030
Stop it! What's with you two?

33
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,710
Are you okay? You got to breathe!

34
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,230
Breathe!

35
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,430
Even so, you beat up
the association's vice chair?

36
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:28,030
With your expulsion,
you can't even coach now.

37
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,140
It was so hard getting you this gig,

38
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,860
so don't cause any trouble.

39
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,260
At least you can be a teacher, got it?

40
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,380
Okay, I'll do my best.

41
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,660
I'll work my hardest, so don't worry.

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,920
Everything will work out, right?

43
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,940
What the heck?

44
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,860
What's wrong? Ki-chul?

45
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,700
Hello, this is...

46
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,620
There's a dam or something...

47
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,100
I'm at the entrance.

48
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,140
Yes, please hurry.

49
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,800
Bye.

50
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,760
Darn it...

51
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,820
Missing Person: Han Su-yeon

52
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,880
- Find me!
- Nah! Haha.

53
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,510
How could anyone doodle on this?

54
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,620
I better erase it.

55
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,460
Dang it...

56
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,430
Drat ...

57
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,340
This town is pretty quiet.

58
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,540
Is there an election coming up?

59
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,900
Hey, Dong-Su.

60
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,170
I'm at the garage.

61
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,820
Yeah, okay.

62
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,540
What a town...

63
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,580
What the heck?

64
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,180
Is this woman insane?

65
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,700
Doodle on her face again,
and I'll kill you, you dirty hags.

66
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,900
you nutcase,

67
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,080
you got a death wish?

68
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,300
Hey, girls!

69
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,380
High schoolers?

70
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,460
Don't fight here, go home.

71
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,940
Buddy, walk away, don't annoy us.

72
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,610
Are they harassing you?

73
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,860
Does it look like that?

74
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,190
That's a rock, you're harassing them?

75
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,940
We're the bullies!

76
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,370
You three looked like it,
you're harassing her?

77
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,700
Don't make presumptions
based on looks.

78
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,980
Anyway, don't fight, and go home!

79
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,380
When Su-yeon comes back, I'll ask her.

80
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,260
If she's not coming home
because of you,

81
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,820
you're dead.

82
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,420
What a psycho...

83
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,100
Coach! What are you doing there?

84
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,780
It's been so long!

85
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,710
3 years, probably.

86
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,100
You're still the same.

87
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,480
I was so surprised to hear
that you were coming here.

88
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,380
Sure.

89
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,540
Why are kids so scary in this town?

90
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,700
Granny!

91
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,620
Hey there, Yu-jin.

92
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,300
Here, I got you some pain reliever.

93
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,700
Thank you, dear.

94
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,740
No calls from Su-yeon today?

95
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,420
No...

96
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,780
I called the police, so don't worry.

97
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,900
I hope she's not missing meals.

98
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,980
Su-Yeon!

99
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,060
What's this? This looks new.

100
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,850
Isn't it pretty?

101
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,150
Who is it?

102
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,690
You!

103
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,300
Why do you only draw butterflies?

104
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,340
They're so free.

105
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,850
When I become an adult,

106
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,620
I want to be free too.

107
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,260
So cringy, even for you, right?

108
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,820
I want to be pretty and be free!

109
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,980
Fly freely!

110
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,010
I better go.

111
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,540
Part-time work?

112
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,020
What do we do with that?

113
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,340
Let it fly away.

114
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,740
Janus

115
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,700
Jeez...

116
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,980
What a town...

117
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,020
Cut off their alcohol supply line.

118
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,540
Let them try running a bar
without any booze.

119
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,060
- What happened?
- Boss.

120
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,090
- We're re-educating her.
- I didn't do it!

121
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,780
I'm busy with the chairman,

122
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,460
so take care of it.

123
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,280
Keep a lid on them!

124
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,580
Yes, boss.

125
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,620
VIPs are coming tomorrow,

126
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,540
get their gifts ready.

127
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:46,940
That's all.

128
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,100
- Take care.
- Good night, boss!

129
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:05,660
These students didn't pay
their tuition and lunch money.

130
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,900
I see.

131
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,500
The homeroom teachers
can only do so much.

132
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,980
That's why I want you to be
the dean of students.

133
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,210
Yes, I understand.

134
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,480
Our foundation will audit
after this semester,

135
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:26,260
we hope to collect at least 80%.

136
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,440
I did some work as a credit card debt collector.

137
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,210
I think I can do this well.

138
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,000
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.

139
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,790
I trust you to do well then.

140
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,540
I'll do my best.

141
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,060
Listen up!

142
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,300
Attention!

143
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,870
This is our new gym teacher
and dean of students Yuk Ki-chul.

144
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,030
Good afternoon, nice to meet you.

145
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,490
I will do my...

146
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,100
- Sit over there.
- There...

147
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,490
- You okay?
- Are you okay?

148
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,900
You okay?

149
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,760
You could've been hurt.

150
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,820
That's mine!

151
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,570
Let me help you...

152
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,710
There's one more! Here!

153
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,020
What a weirdo.

154
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,120
Mr. Kim!

155
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,290
Mr. Yuk.

156
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,000
- Hello.
- Are you all right?

157
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,240
She could've been hurt.

158
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,560
Got to be careful.

159
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,170
Must be hard being a dean of students.

160
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,090
Not at all.

161
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,290
Nah, I did it once too.

162
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,690
It's not easy trying to get money
from the kids.

163
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,370
Let me give you a tip.

164
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,390
Lunchtime is the best time.

165
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,260
Everyone's together at the cafeteria.

166
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,880
I see, right.

167
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,100
Please take this.

168
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,780
- Thank you.
- Yup.

169
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,620
- Take care.
- Yup.

170
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,530
Are you Park Min-ji?

171
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,760
No, I'm not.

172
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:52,870
Who's that man?

173
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,510
I heard he's a gym teacher.

174
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,740
Look at that face!

175
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,700
I'll take care of that on my own.

176
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,870
Yeah?

177
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,510
You're bothering us during lunch?

178
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,750
Girls,

179
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,740
is there Yang Se-hee here?

180
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,260
We made a reservation
for you, chairman.

181
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,220
I prefer to have lunch
with the students and chat.

182
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,730
Good afternoon.

183
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,140
Mr. Yuk.

184
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,970
He's a former Asian Champion,

185
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,720
and coached boxing club.

186
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,530
Is that so? Good to meet you.

187
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,290
You look so dependable.

188
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,010
Take good care of them.

189
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,220
Who's that fatty?

190
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,900
He's a new dean,
who's collecting lunch money.

191
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,470
Jeez, he looks like a gangster.

192
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,580
Kang Yu-jin

193
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,180
Hey, wait, wait.

194
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,760
Are you Kang Yu-jin
from the senior class?

195
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,450
Why?

196
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,250
You are.

197
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:25,100
You didn't pay this semester's tuition,
it's $432.60.

198
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,450
I'll pay.

199
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,830
I'm not scolding you for not paying,

200
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:32,230
but you won't graduate if you don't.

201
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,190
Then I won't graduate.

202
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,780
Right, what? You have to graduate!

203
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,120
Wait,

204
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,900
isn't there Han Su-yeon in your class?

205
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,840
What about her?

206
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,810
She hasn't paid since last year,
it's over $1,070,

207
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,900
is she a runaway?
She doesn't come to school.

208
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,430
She's not a runaway.

209
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,860
I was just asking.

210
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,550
Don't assume anything
without knowing her.

211
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,800
Why is everyone in this town
always so angry?

212
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,790
Missing Person: Han Su-yeon

213
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,930
The school bulletin board
isn't your personal blog.

214
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,330
Who told you post this
without permission?

215
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,070
It's obvious I won't get it.

216
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,330
Kang Yu-jin,

217
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,930
stop worrying about the runaway,
and mind your business.

218
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,600
So many people got in trouble
for being nosy...

219
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,420
You should mind your students!

220
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,910
I'd have beaten them back
in the day...

221
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,910
Boys Washroom

222
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,750
Girls Washroom

223
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,240
Eh? What's she...

224
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,810
Jeeze...

225
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,750
Yes?

226
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,160
No one called you.

227
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,910
Good afternoon.

228
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,620
You get gassy as you get older.

229
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,010
Quite a bit.

230
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,580
- Mr. Yuk.
- Yes?

231
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,840
Going on a patrol for the kids
in town later?

232
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,940
Yes.

233
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:50,600
If you go behind the bank,

234
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,770
a ton of kids smoke there.

235
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:54,520
I see.

236
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:59,160
Also visit the homes of students who didn't pay.

237
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,400
I'm doing my very best,
so no need to worry.

238
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,700
And I'm going on a patrol,
so I'll call you later.

239
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,890
Two fish cakes please.

240
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,380
- How much?
- $1.

241
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,920
I'd like to make something
absolutely clear!

242
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,610
The halted bridge construction is

243
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,780
a vital business to our economy!

244
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,760
We will not harm the environment!

245
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,270
You're full of garbage!

246
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,970
All the politicians are the same!

247
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,280
They're all liars!

248
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,580
Let go! Don't touch me!

249
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,850
Don't listen to him! Nothing but lies!

250
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:47,150
I promise you,

251
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:51,780
I'll do my best to improve our region!

252
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:58,060
Kim to-colors! Kim to-colors!

253
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,130
Wait...

254
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:11,890
What the...

255
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,130
Hey!

256
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,900
Can I ask you something?

257
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,300
Do you know her?

258
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,390
Where do you think you are?

259
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,980
Look at that, isn't that Chae-lim?

260
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,200
Su-yeon's name was Chae-lim here?

261
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,850
- Who's Su-yeon?
- Buddy.

262
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,840
Get out.

263
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,490
Kang Yu-jin, you little brat!

264
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,010
Why are you here?

265
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,400
Where are you going?

266
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,300
You can't go up there!

267
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,350
My apologies, she's my student.

268
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,850
I'm a school teacher.

269
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:45,820
Hey, Kang Yu-jin!
Hey, teach!

270
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,010
Are you kidding me? Come here!

271
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:48,890
Excuse me...

272
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,680
Who are you?

273
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,150
There's no one like that, get out!

274
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,140
I'll take her, so let her go.

275
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,190
Son of a gun!

276
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,210
Let her go.

277
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,420
You jerk...

278
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,980
I've had it.

279
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,040
We'll go quietly,
let's not make trouble.

280
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,620
- I have to ask the ladies.
- Forget it, just go!

281
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,590
I can't just leave!

282
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,600
That man called her Chae-lim
after seeing her photo.

283
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:09,230
He could be mistaken.

284
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,270
You're not allowed at a place
like this.

285
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,020
Come talk to me, I'm your teacher.

286
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,230
Don't pretend to care
and waste our time.

287
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,910
I'm not, cases like

288
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,290
this must be thoroughly investigated.

289
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,320
Why are you so impatient?

290
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,890
Stick with the toy crane.

291
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,540
So you saw, but that was...

292
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,130
I'm not really sure...

293
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,120
Look carefully.

294
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,640
She worked here
under the name Chae-lim, right?

295
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,690
I don't know.

296
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,690
Madame Iseul should know
about other girls.

297
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,080
Madame Iseul?

298
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,980
I'm sorry, I got to go.

299
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,290
I see...

300
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,870
We love these!

301
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,850
Always be healthy.

302
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,150
- Byung-doo.
- Yes?

303
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,420
- Thank him for us.
- Absolutely!

304
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,800
Come on, get in here!

305
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,030
- Welcome.
- Come in.

306
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,490
Treat them well tonight.

307
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,180
It's been a while,
have a lot fun, okay?

308
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,450
Okay!

309
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,210
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

310
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,130
Didn't she look like
she was hiding something?

311
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,250
That Madame should know more.

312
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,570
Okay, I hear you,

313
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:48,210
but it's late, head home
before your parents worry.

314
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,150
You're not worried about Su-yeon?

315
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,800
She didn't come to school today too.

316
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,720
I'll talk to her homeroom teacher.

317
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,580
You think I didn't try that?

318
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:00,990
There's not a single adult
who will listen to me.

319
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,080
Not even the police.

320
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:07,690
No one cares, who'll find her then?

321
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:13,250
I'll talk to my police friend.

322
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,990
Stop worrying about it
and just come to school.

323
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,330
No skipping.

324
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,050
Where do you live?

325
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,190
Forget it, drop me off here.

326
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,290
I'll take you home, where is it?

327
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,850
I can go home on my own,
drop me off here!

328
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,950
But this is...

329
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,230
Hey, you'll break the door...

330
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,930
That brat...

331
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,410
Adults won't listen to me.

332
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,460
My phone...

333
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,960
Mom: Where are you?
That idiot...

334
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,590
She's so clumsy.

335
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,760
What's that?

336
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,780
Yu-jin?

337
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,820
Hey!

338
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,580
Who was that?

339
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:53,870
Yu-jin!

340
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,730
Yu-jin! Are you okay?

341
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,600
Kochun General Hospital

342
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,850
Thank you.

343
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,940
It looks like she didn't suffer
any serious injuries,

344
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,020
and we'll look into
the missing person case.

345
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,290
Sir, wait a moment.

346
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,280
That man could've kidnapped
my friend too.

347
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,640
Sure, I'll look into it too.

348
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,100
When exactly will you?

349
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,680
I made a report but nothing yet.

350
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,760
There's a procedure in place.

351
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,930
Don't worry and wait.

352
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,250
Don't worry too much,
we'll get back to you.

353
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,090
Good night.

354
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:05,830
What's with those cops?
They reek of booze.

355
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,960
Not doing their job too.

356
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,550
Since it's election period,
everyone's being pretty mum.

357
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,720
But this is no ordinary case.

358
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,450
He tased and attacked her.

359
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,440
They'll investigate properly,
don't you worry.

360
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:25,900
What about Yu-jin's report?
Why is nothing done?

361
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,210
Well, that's...

362
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,580
- It can't be filed.
- Why not?

363
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,740
It requires consent
from the immediate family...

364
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:38,130
Buddy, then why didn't you tell her?

365
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,470
Runaways are common for girls her age.

366
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,960
Coach, we'll take care of it,
you don't need to worry.

367
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,800
You're an outsider,
you shouldn't get involved.

368
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,330
Jeez...

369
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,800
Han Su-yeon: Parents deceased,

370
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:12,000
lives with grandmother.

371
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,200
I hereby allow Yuk Ki-chul
to act on my behalf.

372
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:40,130
The cops will do their best,

373
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,490
so don't worry too much.

374
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:48,140
Thank you for coming all this way for Su-yeon.

375
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,740
Not at all, it's my duty.

376
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,080
After losing her parents,

377
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,430
she's been all alone.

378
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:06,000
But I'm so happy
someone like you is looking after her.

379
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,810
What's this about first thing
in the morning?

380
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,740
Here, take this.

381
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,740
What's this?

382
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,660
Consent form, file the report.

383
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:20,170
Coach, you did a pointless thing.

384
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,520
- Why is it pointless?
- I told you, we'll take care of it.

385
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,750
What's with you since yesterday?

386
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,080
What I mean is...

387
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,860
Is this how cops work down here?

388
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,810
Fine, fine, I'll take care of it.

389
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,210
Do it properly!

390
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:41,540
Look into a bar called Janus
where she used to work at.

391
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,600
Sure.

392
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,660
What a moron...

393
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,550
- Hurry it up.
- Sure.

394
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,320
The chairman's election isn't far off,

395
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:57,210
so keep a tight leash
on troublemakers.

396
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:01,200
Can't you be on time?

397
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:08,980
On the election day,
make sure to vote on the way here.

398
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:13,600
Mr. Yuk, don't believe
the students too much.

399
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,660
Han Yu-jin had many problems
after transferring here from Seoul.

400
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:22,240
It's Kang Yu-jin.

401
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,270
Yes, Kang Yu-jin.

402
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,920
And look at this,

403
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,100
Han Su-yeon had
many unauthorized absents.

404
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,250
Then she'd show up
as if it was nothing.

405
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,680
I'm sure she ran away

406
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:38,780
and doing some stupid things.

407
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,480
Even so,

408
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,620
she disappeared
while working at a bar.

409
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,010
That's why she ran away.

410
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:50,120
It's obvious
what kind of a girl works there.

411
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,740
- What do you mean by that?
- Mr. Yuk, could we talk?

412
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,350
Why are you so gung-ho?

413
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,080
The country kids may feel naïve

414
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,300
but they really aren't.

415
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,400
But even so...

416
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:10,210
We had a student last semester
who went to Seoul for an audition,

417
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:13,550
and never came home.

418
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,720
She was also never reported for missing person?
- No...

419
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,800
leave those kids alone,

420
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:23,380
and focus on collecting tuition.

421
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:26,220
That's how you get
high performance evaluation!

422
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,880
I understand.

423
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,080
Good.

424
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,760
Hey.

425
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,260
Why're you so desperate
to meet the madame?

426
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,350
I talked to my cop friend
this morning.

427
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,700
It's no point talking to cops
in this town.

428
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:55,610
You're not scared
even after what happened yesterday?

429
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,820
What if you really do get hurt?

430
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,080
Aren't you afraid
that you'd get hurt instead?

431
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,420
What'd you do if Su-yeon was your daughter?

432
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:07,840
Just collect money from kids
and wait for cops to do their job?

433
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,830
But...

434
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,260
What I mean is...

435
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,730
When you helped me leave at the bar,

436
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:20,070
I thought you'd be different.

437
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,750
Stick with collecting money
from the girls!

438
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,620
You brat!

439
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,900
Yu-jin.

440
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,190
Is something wrong?

441
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,320
Det. Oh, what is it now?

442
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,310
The new case is her, right?

443
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,670
- The thing is...
- What did I tell you?

444
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,360
I told you not to report her case!

445
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,700
But he even got a consent form
so I couldn't refuse.

446
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,520
You jerk!

447
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,850
Get down to the station!

448
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,880
Right away.

449
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,580
I don't believe this.

450
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,710
Those brats!

451
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,760
Why you little!

452
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:03,190
Come out with your cigarettes!

453
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,780
- We didn't smoke.
- Like hell you didn't.

454
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,000
Got any evidence?

455
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:10,030
Smoke's coming out of your nose!
Give me the cigarettes!

456
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,610
You came to our bathroom.

457
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,960
I've had it, cough it up!

458
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:18,140
You're done if I find them,
stay right there.

459
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,450
So annoying.

460
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,830
Cigarette...

461
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,920
- Let's go.
- Where did you hide it?

462
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,850
Just stay right there!

463
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,010
Girls! Stop!

464
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:35,180
How did this fall?

465
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,560
Those punks...

466
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,600
What's this?

467
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,910
Yes, Vice Principal.

468
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:17,270
I'm here, sir, I found something in...

469
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,730
You were the one
who reported to the police?

470
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:21,710
Pardon?

471
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:24,390
Did you report our student missing?

472
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,750
I got a call from the police
for confirmation.

473
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,350
Yes, her name is Han Su-yeon.

474
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,950
Mr. Yuk,

475
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,960
I told you to keep a leash on them,

476
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,560
not pour gasoline to the fire.

477
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:38,620
But she has been absent
for a few days.

478
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,610
Mr. Yuk!

479
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,350
Why mention school affairs
to outside world?

480
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,210
Over some runaway!

481
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,190
But it doesn't look like a runaway...

482
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,510
Look here!

483
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,700
As your superior,

484
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,910
let me give you an advice.

485
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,890
Do your work and stay in line.

486
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,070
One bad apple can spoil the bunch.

487
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:43,030
Thank you for looking
into the art academy.

488
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,390
Sure, thanks.

489
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,510
Mr. Kim?

490
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,930
Are you heading out?

491
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,470
Yes.

492
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,950
Could you help me with these?

493
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,670
One, SURE.

494
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,190
Thank you!

495
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,150
Let's go, I'm in a rush.

496
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,470
Kang Yu-jin: Where are you?

497
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,550
I'm on my way, wait a little longer.

498
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,670
Okay, I'm on my way too.

499
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,780
They have su-yeon

500
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,960
I'm tied up with something,

501
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,950
could you come pick me up?

502
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,030
Yes, I'll be right there, wait for me.

503
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,150
Dumb Bear

504
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,010
Coach yuk ki-chul

505
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,630
You idiot,

506
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:52,090
you defied my order
and reported it on your own?

507
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,960
Where are you?

508
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,300
None of your business.

509
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:07,790
Stop kidding around, where are you?

510
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:09,810
Are you with the art teacher?

511
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:13,090
Don't get in his car and see me.

512
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,170
Where are you?

513
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,820
What are you talking about?

514
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,680
He installed a spy cam
in girls' washroom.

515
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,160
He's a pervert!

516
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:25,010
Didn't Su-yeon disappear on July 6th?

517
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:26,530
Yes...

518
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:29,670
Right? I thought he was off.

519
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,090
I checked his messages,

520
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,920
he picked her up that night.

521
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:40,570
Tell me where you are.

522
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,050
So, the thing is...

523
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:47,670
Are you with him now?

524
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:49,250
Yes.

525
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,240
Text me where you are, got it?

526
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,550
Yes.

527
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,290
Who were you talking to?

528
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,990
My mom.

529
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,820
Got to put on the seat belt, Yu-jin.

530
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,560
By the way, sir,

531
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,640
isn't the town the other way?

532
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,500
I got to get something from home,

533
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,040
it won't take long.

534
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:51,090
Heading to his home.

535
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:58,650
Heading to his home.

536
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:00,570
Darn it...

537
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:09,690
Mr. Kim, did Su-yeon give you that?

538
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:15,610
Yeah, it was a gift.

539
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,190
Did she ever contact you that day?

540
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:23,270
No.

541
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,100
- Then that night...
- Yu-jin.

542
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,000
Could we stop talking about her?

543
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,580
- After her art class...
- Yu-jin.

544
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:34,410
- Were you with her...
- Darn it! Stop it!

545
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,060
Get up.

546
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,840
Yu-jin.

547
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:31,530
Let me see you.

548
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:34,410
I didn't hit you
because I don't like you.

549
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:40,330
It's a misunderstanding,
I didn't do anything to her.

550
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:57,010
Don't look at me like that.

551
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,200
No, I didn't do anything to her.

552
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:17,020
It's the truth.

553
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:19,930
You got it all wrong!

554
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,680
Yu-jin!

555
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:52,510
Yu-jin!

556
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,550
You jerk! Come here!

557
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:08,940
Get over here!

558
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,060
Mr. Yuk, wait a minute...

559
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:16,040
Yu-jin!

560
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,060
You pervert!

561
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,910
A teacher installs a spy cam?

562
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,040
What were you going to do
after kidnapping her?

563
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:29,030
I'm so sorry.

564
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,060
Please don't report me.

565
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:32,450
Look at this jerk.

566
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:36,470
Why do you have Su-yeon's phone?

567
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,490
Did you do something to her?

568
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,250
- That's not it!
- Don't you lie to me,

569
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,600
should I call the police?

570
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:46,230
No, please.

571
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,070
I'll tell you the truth.

572
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:56,260
She called me that night

573
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,660
so I went to pick her up.

574
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:03,420
Su-yeon, are you okay?

575
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,080
Okay.

576
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:04,930
Mr. Kim, you go on ahead.

577
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:08,570
Someone's picking me up.

578
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,700
Who?

579
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,020
Someone...

580
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:16,750
Don't worry, you can go.

581
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:19,020
Thank you.

582
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,690
I dropped her off and was leaving...

583
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,040
But I was worried, so I went back.

584
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,620
Su-Yeon?

585
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,040
Su-Yeon?

586
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:13,850
Are you in here?

587
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,880
Su-Yeon?

588
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:45,800
So you found it there?
You expect me to believe that?

589
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:47,140
It's the truth.

590
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,140
I haven't seen her since then.

591
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:51,930
Why didn't you report right away?

592
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:58,020
Being a recent hire,
I didn't want to stir anything up,

593
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:01,610
you know perfectly well
what that's like.

594
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,120
What a jerk...

595
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:10,040
I liked her in a pure way.

596
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,480
Why is that a problem?

597
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,480
Are you nuts? In a pure way?

598
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:18,320
You're out of your mind!
She's a minor!

599
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,000
Didn't you try to kidnap Yu-jin
last night?

600
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:24,760
I had drinks with Vice Principal
last night!

601
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,040
I'm telling you the truth.

602
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,600
Check it out for yourself.

603
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:35,360
Even so, you need a real beating.

604
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,360
- But sir...
- Be quiet.

605
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,480
Hello?

606
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,600
This is the police!

607
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,040
We got a report!

608
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,160
Darn it!

609
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,800
I made the report.

610
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:00,520
There's definitely something wrong
with him.

611
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,680
He's too suspicious,
a girl's gone too.

612
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,600
Okay, sure, we'll look into it.

613
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:09,130
You got to look into her phone,
track down the last caller...

614
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:13,640
I said we'll look into it!

615
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,800
You better head home.

616
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:22,400
Could you do it properly?
Don't just say you will.

617
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,400
Sure thing, good bye.

618
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,800
Ma'am, this way.

619
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,000
Yes, chief.

620
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:32,390
Yes, I understand.

621
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:36,240
Could you leave? You're in the way.

622
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,800
Coach.

623
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:48,840
The evidence was submitted,
so they'll open a case.

624
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,400
When the phone's fixed,

625
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,120
find out who the last caller was.

626
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:58,080
Coach, I can't really disclose
any case details.

627
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,760
I'm her teacher, I have to know.

628
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,960
You're really putting me in a spot.

629
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,960
Did you file the missing person?

630
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,000
Well, not yet...

631
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,360
Not yet?

632
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,640
It's the election season,
it's out of my hands.

633
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,440
What's with you all?

634
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,530
You're going about the wrong way!

635
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,440
I know that!

636
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:22,880
I got to go on a patrol,
I'll call you later.

637
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:28,290
Hey, is this the only one?

638
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,480
Did you plant them anywhere else?

639
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,680
Kim to-color

640
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,720
Buddy! Am I boring you?

641
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,840
Hello, detective.

642
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:53,130
How did you like the new batch?

643
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,100
I didn't call you about that,

644
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,940
we managed to stop
the missing person case,

645
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,280
but that jerk brought
in a piece of evidence.

646
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,440
It's turning into a major headache.

647
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,880
Welcome, Mr. Chairman.

648
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:17,840
Evening, sir.

649
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:19,800
Hello, chief.

650
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,480
- And the congressman?
- He'll be here shortly.

651
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:23,870
Thank you for coming.

652
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:24,840
Mr. Chairman,

653
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:27,450
we have a situation.

654
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,720
This is your best

655
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,880
during this sensitive period?

656
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:40,090
Do it right.

657
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,440
Yes, sir.

658
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:47,870
What is it? Something wrong?

659
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:54,670
Seok-jae, we got a problem.

660
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,660
...dead last.
And again for the mid-terms.

661
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,360
Don't worry,
I'll get them to a Seoul university...

662
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,600
Vice Principal!

663
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,540
The art teacher is up
on the online bulletin board.

664
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:28,560
- That's indeed him!
- Is she from our school?

665
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,570
3rd year, Han Su-yeon.

666
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,200
This could be all made up.

667
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,360
Wait a minute,

668
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:36,790
- spy cam in girls washroom?
- My gosh...

669
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:38,300
This could be a prank.

670
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:40,550
- I didn't see him like that.
- This can't be.

671
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:41,980
Who put this up?

672
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:44,760
How could you be so irresponsible?

673
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:48,440
It doesn't matter,
I'm doing everything I can.

674
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:52,150
You got to graduate,
you'll regret this later.

675
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:54,050
I know.

676
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:55,470
Jeeze...

677
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,330
You're too young
to understand the world.

678
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:02,310
Sir, I'm all grown up.

679
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:05,630
I just have to age.

680
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:21,320
We were in a rush to hire someone,

681
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,620
and didn't do all due process.

682
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:28,070
I don't quite understand, sir.

683
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,000
My apologies to you, Mr. Yuk.

684
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:36,070
We'll return the school
development fund you paid.

685
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:44,140
I've added severance
and moving fee costs.

686
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:53,560
I hope you don't feel too bad
about it.

687
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,840
You don't want to cause problems
to each other, no?

688
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:05,850
This is good for everyone.

689
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:34,990
Ki-chul, that was...

690
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,350
our savings

691
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,600
and a loan from dad.

692
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:45,520
Knowing you, I didn't tell you.

693
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:49,660
Very Ki-chul,

694
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:53,550
everyone lives that way.

695
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:03,390
Yeah, Dong-su.

696
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:08,560
Coach, I just received a report.

697
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,260
Could you step back?

698
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:53,910
It's Han Su-yeon.

699
00:59:57,950 --> 00:59:59,710
I don't believe this.

700
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:46,890
Su-Yeon ...

701
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:48,520
Wait a minute!

702
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,640
Yu-jin!

703
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:54,330
Su-Yeon!

704
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,320
Su-Yeon!

705
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:05,460
Let go of me!

706
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:08,460
Yu-jin!

707
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:23,570
Missing Person

708
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:17,180
We fended off the reporters today
but it won't be so easy later.

709
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:20,730
Call the station chief.

710
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:24,310
He's bloodthirsty for money lately.

711
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:25,680
That jerk...

712
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:41,650
Jin-su, it's me.

713
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:44,330
Remember the phone evidence
brought in yesterday?

714
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:46,740
What?

715
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:52,550
Granny!

716
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:55,620
Granny...

717
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:57,470
Hi, Yu-jin...

718
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:57,340
That's Dong-su.

719
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,300
What do we do with him?

720
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:03,770
Stupid idiot...

721
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,180
Hold on.

722
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:14,150
This is more than
just reassigning a few men.

723
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:17,590
My neck is on the line here.

724
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:22,830
Who got your job
as the chief of police?

725
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:28,250
Who lobbied your bosses for you?

726
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:29,550
The thing is...

727
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:31,350
When I'm implicated,

728
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:34,570
who do you think will fall?

729
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,280
Seok-jae.

730
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:44,300
Yup, it's working.

731
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:50,560
Boss

732
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:53,470
Eh? Janus boss?

733
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:54,410
Yes.

734
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:58,740
And she texted a woman
named Iseul that night.

735
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:00,850
She's the madame there.

736
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,080
I don't know what happened,

737
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:06,220
but she texted Su-yeon
that she was worried.

738
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,170
Coach, I'll look into it further
and call you back.

739
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:10,100
Okay, thanks.

740
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:11,140
Sure.

741
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,410
Yu-jin, I got somewhere to be,

742
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:26,820
take good care of her.

743
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:28,830
Will you be back?

744
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,480
I'll be right back.

745
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,280
Mr. Yuk.

746
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:50,250
Mr. Chairman, it's time to leave.

747
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:55,290
Tell him I'll be late.

748
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,360
It's me, boss.

749
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:19,050
That dumb teacher is here.

750
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,080
I'll be right there, wait for me.

751
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:21,810
Of course.

752
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:23,940
This is it, sir.

753
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:38,010
Madame Iseul?

754
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:40,170
Could we talk?

755
01:06:40,770 --> 01:06:41,440
What?

756
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:42,450
Just a moment, please.

757
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:52,100
You knew Su-yeon, right?

758
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:53,980
I don't know anything.

759
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:55,380
She's dead.

760
01:06:57,290 --> 01:06:58,430
Madame Iseul,

761
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:01,880
You can't pretend to be
ignorant anymore.

762
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:07,410
Please tell me,
what happened that night?

763
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:12,450
That night...

764
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:33,200
Commissioner, have a drink

765
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:34,810
and take it easy today.

766
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:37,010
You'll reach high places,

767
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:39,250
I'm not worthy of your attention.

768
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:41,480
Only with your help.

769
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:44,450
There isn't much I can do.

770
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:50,810
Thank you for everything!

771
01:07:53,130 --> 01:07:55,330
I'm going to go to the washroom.

772
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:01,010
Are you sick?

773
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:06,620
Where does it hurt?

774
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:13,680
Okay, I'll be there soon, wait for me.

775
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:16,730
Why aren't you coming in?

776
01:08:17,490 --> 01:08:19,130
Did you cry?

777
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:32,790
Could you...

778
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:37,220
Could you help me, Mr. Chairman?

779
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:39,440
You know me?

780
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,870
I'm actually a student
from Suhwa High.

781
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:47,190
My grandma is really sick,
may I leave early?

782
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:53,670
What are you doing here?

783
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:55,850
Let's go.

784
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,900
Are you out of your mind?

785
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:01,110
How could you recruit from my school?

786
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:05,410
We were bringing
in really young girls...

787
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:10,250
I'm sorry, sir.

788
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:12,340
What if she mentions something
at school?

789
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:14,710
I'll keep her mouth shut.

790
01:09:14,790 --> 01:09:17,350
Her parents had a debt with us,

791
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,480
she won't be careless.

792
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:31,060
Commissioner, are you okay?

793
01:09:41,650 --> 01:09:44,770
Chae-lim, where are you? Are you hurt?

794
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:48,890
Tell me where you are!

795
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,440
You tramp,

796
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,410
should I ask your granny at home?

797
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:55,770
Where?

798
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:03,010
Got it, don't move a muscle,
I'll be right there.

799
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,240
You go on ahead.

800
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:11,720
So Gwak was the last one
to see Su-yeon alive?

801
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:14,740
He hung up and left right away.

802
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:17,660
That's all I know.

803
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:22,690
He's a rat in a pot, search slowly.

804
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:27,160
Stop causing problems
in someone else's town!

805
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:30,010
Stop right there.

806
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:34,200
Are you Gwak?

807
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:37,030
You were right here?

808
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,290
Can we chat?

809
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:44,620
- Boss, should I take him outside?
- I came for a short chat.

810
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:52,170
Did you kill Su-yeon?

811
01:11:56,290 --> 01:11:58,410
Did you kill her?

812
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:00,700
I didn't kill her.

813
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:02,570
Then who did?

814
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,420
Who killed her?

815
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:08,030
Look, it wasn't me!

816
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:19,110
Where's that chick?

817
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:34,150
Tramp!

818
01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:36,750
Where are you?

819
01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:38,990
I've had it with this chick.

820
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:41,490
Right here?

821
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:46,270
Gosh darn it...

822
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:52,280
If you don't want to die,
you better come out.

823
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:01,340
Are you in here?

824
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:18,990
Who are you?

825
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:47,330
Holy cow...

826
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:51,860
You better come over here.

827
01:13:52,070 --> 01:13:53,350
What's going on?

828
01:13:53,410 --> 01:13:55,210
It's about...

829
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:57,490
your son.

830
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:58,580
Son?

831
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:06,540
Coach, someone took the phone.

832
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,400
Something's really off.

833
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:10,520
You know that art teacher?

834
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:13,110
He was released last night.

835
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:45,140
Mr. Kim?

836
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:51,340
You're awake?

837
01:14:56,930 --> 01:14:57,930
Yes, Mrs. Kang.

838
01:14:58,010 --> 01:15:01,610
Are you with Yu-jin by any chance?

839
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:03,080
Isn't she at the hospital?

840
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:07,380
I just got here and she's not here,
her phone's off too.

841
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,320
What?

842
01:15:09,230 --> 01:15:10,350
Yu-jin.

843
01:15:10,730 --> 01:15:13,130
I think you misunderstood about me.

844
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:17,130
I'm not like my dad.

845
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:42,050
Where's her phone?

846
01:15:44,930 --> 01:15:46,090
Right here.

847
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:06,170
Leave us for a moment.

848
01:16:06,290 --> 01:16:07,210
Yes, sir.

849
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:11,690
No, father!

850
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:15,050
I didn't know she was dead...

851
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,650
Ji-Sung.

852
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:26,370
Have I done something wrong to you?

853
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:33,690
I've worked so hard to make you a man.

854
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:41,890
I'm sorry, father, I'm so sorry!

855
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:44,250
Father! Please!

856
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:45,370
On your feet!

857
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:47,010
Stand up straight!

858
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:49,890
Do it right!

859
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:09,130
Don't be scared, Yu-jin.

860
01:17:30,370 --> 01:17:31,570
Yu-jin!

861
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:32,710
Yu-jin!

862
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:34,530
Don't make a sound, I'll kill you too!

863
01:17:56,610 --> 01:17:59,970
Why didn't you answer your phone?

864
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:21,290
Responsibility 22-1.

865
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:23,810
22-1!

866
01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:26,970
What's all this?

867
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:31,630
Bastard, this is why
you were holed up here?

868
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:35,810
Go back to America.

869
01:18:38,370 --> 01:18:41,690
Father, the semester isn't over,

870
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:44,940
- the students need...
- Are you desperate to ruin me?

871
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:48,210
Stay there until things cool down!

872
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:54,060
There are students who rely on me...

873
01:18:56,210 --> 01:19:00,840
I even cleaned up your mess
by killing her, yet you won't listen?

874
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:05,250
So why did you kill her?

875
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,520
Help me...

876
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:10,890
Please help...

877
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:23,500
Mr. Chairman...

878
01:19:26,170 --> 01:19:27,450
Mr. Kim...

879
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,810
I won't tell anyone...

880
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:44,570
Please help...

881
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,000
Good.

882
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:50,040
You shouldn't tell anyone.

883
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:19,830
What?

884
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:22,990
You stupid jerk! It was for you!

885
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:26,230
Why was that for me?

886
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:28,430
I've had it!

887
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:35,930
Stand up straight, you ungrateful!

888
01:20:38,890 --> 01:20:40,450
Why are you doing this?

889
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:42,190
Please! Father!

890
01:20:54,670 --> 01:20:56,270
Please!

891
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:02,030
Just do what I tell you!

892
01:21:28,710 --> 01:21:30,190
Hello, commissioner.

893
01:21:31,390 --> 01:21:32,830
I'm on my way.

894
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:34,910
Yes, sir.

895
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:41,590
Get ready to fly out,
I'll send someone tomorrow.

896
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:50,830
Stupid idiot...

897
01:21:52,870 --> 01:21:55,190
Who did he take after?

898
01:21:59,150 --> 01:22:00,350
He's on his way.

899
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:01,870
- Is that so?
- Yes.

900
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:05,470
Let's get ready, everyone.

901
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:10,630
Yu-jin.

902
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:15,070
You can come out now.

903
01:22:23,830 --> 01:22:24,870
Yu-jin!

904
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:33,830
Yu-jin!

905
01:22:58,430 --> 01:23:00,990
Why are you doing this to me?

906
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:31,750
Yu-jin.

907
01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:37,560
Why are you making me into a bad guy?

908
01:23:51,710 --> 01:23:53,910
You can't escape no matter what.

909
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,710
Come on out now.

910
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,240
Yu-jin!

911
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:08,280
Yu-jin!

912
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:10,270
Are you in there?

913
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:17,990
Yu-jin!

914
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:22,100
Yu-jin!

915
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:23,820
Wake up! Yu-jin!

916
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:43,850
Yu-jin, wake up!

917
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:07,350
You son of a gun...

918
01:26:17,650 --> 01:26:18,570
Come here!

919
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,600
Don't kill me...

920
01:26:25,410 --> 01:26:26,610
Please...

921
01:26:27,330 --> 01:26:28,970
I'm so sorry.

922
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:38,980
Yu-jin! Yu-jin!

923
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:45,460
Hold on!

924
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:40,180
Tallying is under way
with Kim Ki-tae tailing behind.

925
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,720
That jerk's poking around everywhere,

926
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:46,700
send out an APB and find him!

927
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:07,620
Yu-jin!

928
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:09,900
Yu-jin, you got to wake up!

929
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:12,380
Don't fall asleep, okay?

930
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:22,820
Governorship of Kochun

931
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:51,340
Mr. Yuk...

932
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:53,300
I'm right here!

933
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:57,740
The one who killed Su-yeon...

934
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:00,780
was Chairman Kim.

935
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:57,100

01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:38,150

Kim to-colors! Kim to-colors!

938
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:46,100
Hello, Commissioner.

939
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:49,590
Call me Governor Kim.

940
01:30:50,970 --> 01:30:53,130
This is all thanks to you.

941
01:30:54,470 --> 01:30:56,890
Let's all get together for a drink.

942
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,200
Ow, my head...

943
01:31:24,330 --> 01:31:25,930
What happened?

944
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:40,000
That crazy jerk!

945
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:41,220
Stop him!

946
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:42,230
Yes, sir!

947
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:46,740
Who the heck are you?

948
01:31:49,690 --> 01:31:51,530
Son of a gun!

949
01:31:52,490 --> 01:31:53,930
You jerk!

950
01:31:54,400 --> 01:32:00,000
Do you know who I am?
You're a dead man now!

951
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:04,550
You better run!

952
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,280
You're an absolute jerk! You're done!

953
01:32:08,670 --> 01:32:10,650
I'm a governor, you fool!

954
01:32:10,730 --> 01:32:13,600
You messed with the wrong man!

955
01:32:13,670 --> 01:32:17,380
You're so dead, you stupid jerk!

956
01:32:36,610 --> 01:32:41,050
Chief, thanks for the call,
there's a crazy guy...

957
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:44,080
What?

958
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:07,480
GoverNor-Elect Kim to-Color

959
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:12,600
is arrested for the murder
of a high school student.

960
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:16,540
His son and a local gang,

961
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:20,540
police chief and detectives

962
01:33:20,610 --> 01:33:22,170
are also under investigation.

963
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:36,080
You got here
just for all that trouble.

964
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:38,530
Do your job.

965
01:33:40,090 --> 01:33:41,370
I better.

966
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:43,830
How's your head?

967
01:33:44,050 --> 01:33:45,210
I'm fine.

968
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:46,750
Be careful.

969
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:49,060
I'm off.

970
01:33:49,190 --> 01:33:50,110
Sure thing.

971
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:54,010
Drive safe and call me
if you ever come back.

972
01:33:54,770 --> 01:33:55,890
Sure, take care.

973
01:33:56,570 --> 01:33:59,480
You should get a new car,
it's too small for you.

974
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:01,100
I'm penniless, you jerk.

975
01:34:01,610 --> 01:34:03,170
So long!
