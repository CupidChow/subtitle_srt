Oh, is there anything?

20
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,640
There seems to be something.

21
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,090
I don't know. Let's go out and check.

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,180
Put the card with your name on it

23
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,830
and the man you want to date tomorrow...

24
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,460
(Staggered)

25
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,100
We can recommend ourselves by letter.

26
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:16,340
I'm speechless.

27
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:16,920
(Starts to be shy already)
I'm speechless.

I had something to say after the meeting,

34
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,740
so I put the letter in.
(The men they want to talk more with)

(Who will be their dating choice?)

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
So the men who have received letters get to choose their dates?

44
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,320
It seems only those who have found matches can have dates.

Wow, this is crazy!

61
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,510
Is it a lake?

62
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,630
I think it should be called river.

63
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:14,730
It's large.

64
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,190
It's very large.

65
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,650
Yeah.

66
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,110
There are many colorful flowers.

67
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,190
There aren't so many.

68
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,780
(Embarrassed)

69
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,760
It's a pity there aren't many flowers.

70
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,260
But they're really beautiful.

71
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,000
(Really)

(Really)

73
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,060
There's something over there, right?
(Really)

74
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,640
There's something over there, right?

75
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,720
But I especially like willows.

76
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:38,980
Oh, really?

77
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,590
(Really?)
Oh, really?

78
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:39,829
(Really?)

79
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:40,740
Don't you like them?
(Really?)

80
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,900
(Don't you like it?)
(Really?)

81
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:39,900
(Really?)

82
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,500
I think it's a bit scary seeing several willows grow together.
(Don't you like it?)
(Really?)

83
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,020
I think it's a bit scary seeing several willows grow together.

(Embarrassed 2)

85
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:46,620
Let's go and take that.
(Embarrassed 2)

86
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,800
Let's go and take that.

87
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,260
Pedal boat?

88
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:50,620
Yeah.

89
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,150
That?

90
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,380
I think it will be fun.

91

93
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,700
The flowers are pretty.

94
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,020
Really pretty.

95
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,480
Chang-min, you're even prettier.

96
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,400
(Feels embarrassed)

97
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,320
You'd better not say that again.
(Feels embarrassed)

98
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,220
(Feels embarrassed)

99
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,960
Why not? I think it's okay.

100
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,650
It's interesting.

101
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,610
I'll break down.

102
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,130
It's a clear thing that I like Chang-min.

103
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,459
But I wasn't sure if he likes me.

104
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,829
There aren't so many.

105
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,650
I didn't know why. I was just a little sad.

106
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,930
I had a feeling then, like,

107
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,940
"Ah, I care about every word

108
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,530
Chang-min says."

109
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,370
I had such a feeling.

110
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,490
It's really a nice day.

111
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,510
I want to soak my feet in the water.

112
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,050
The weather is so good.

113
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,830
The lake is great too.

114
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,290
I'm in a very good mood.

115
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,780
(Though not good at expressing, Chang-min is also overjoyed.)

116
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,310
It will be my first time to take that.

117
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,530
Pedal boat?

118
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:55,650
Here.

119
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,280
Be careful.

120
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,690
So,

121
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,460
let's try to walk in unison.

122
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,290
I don't feel like swaying.

123
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,730
(Step by step)

124
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,520
Hold on. It sways too badly.
(Step by step)

125
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,280
It seems to be here

126
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,740
where we can take a pedal boat.

127
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,300
Though I've never taken one before,

128
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,640
I may drive it well.

129
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,260
(Scared)

130
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,300
The boat is moving because of the wind.

131
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:37,900
I said the boat is moving because of the wind.

132
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,409
(The pedal boat is moved by the wind unnoticed.)

134
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,380

138
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,820
(Don't know)
(Where are we going?)

139
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:41,390
(Where are we going?)

140
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:42,780
(Where are we going?)

141
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,450
Steer it around.

142
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:48,340
You pedal forward and I pedal backward.

143
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,150
(Take control and set off)
You pedal forward and I pedal backward.

144

00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,420
(Speed up quickly)

146
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,680
Why am I so excited?

147
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,290
Can't we drive slowly?

148
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:02,740
-The sound of water is nice.
-Yeah. It's nice.

149
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,640
(Not bad)
-The sound of water is nice.

151
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,020
Not bad.

152
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,580
It feels great.

153
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,640
I like such activities that give you time to think.

154
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:16,930
I like it too.

155
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,300
The breeze blows when I'm dazing.

156
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,900
Look at my hair. Seriously?

157
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,140
(Checking his look)
Look at my hair. Seriously?

(Checking his look)

159
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,460
You really look like an idol in the camera.
(Checking his look)

160
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,910
You really look like an idol in the camera.

161
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,970
(1 2 3)
One, two, three.

162

(1 2 3)

163
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,850
Click.

(Me?)

219
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,659
I'm very afraid of drawbridges.

220

I hate that feeling.

238
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,920
I want to step forward but I just sway.

239
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,200
(Chang-min comforts frightened Jeong-hyeon.)

240

255
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,850
I was so afraid then, so I looked up at the sky.

256
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:01,680
The scenery was beautiful, the weather was good and the wind was comfortable.

Was it too fast?

279

Because I'm a dull man,

280
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,380
doing that in a crowd

281

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,140
(Professional posture)

324
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,900
The sunshine is great here.

325
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:23,490
(Did I photograph well?)

326
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,240
Did I photograph well?
(Did I photograph well?)

327
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,220
(Did I photograph well?)

328
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:29,540
Wow, you look great.

329
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,610
(Wow, you look great. )
Wow, you look great.

330
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,420
(Wow, you look great. )

331
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:32,580
It's really worthy of being posted on Instagram.

332
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,380
(It's really worthy of being posted on Instagram.)
It's really worthy of being posted on Instagram.

333
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,030
Let me photograph you.

334
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,730
Very good.

335
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:41,710
Good.

336
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:42,470
(Very good)

337
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,350
Good.
(Very good)

338
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,580
(Very good)

339
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,230
We've got a good one.

340
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,220
Ah, great.

341
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,440
(The photographer is very satisfied with his model.)
Ah, great.

342
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,780
OK.
(The photographer is very satisfied with his model.)

343
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,400
OK.

344
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,140
We've got great pictures.

345
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,020
(Look at this one.)
We've got great pictures.

346
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,450
Well, it's pretty.

347
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,320
Wonderful.

348
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,250
-It heals me, really.-Yeah.

349
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,050
It smells good.

350
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,190
Bon appetit.

351
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,430
Bon appetit.

352
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,180
(M-hm)

353
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:15,860
(Is it good?)
(M-hm)

354
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,190
Is it good?
(Is it good?)

355
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:15,410
(Is it good?)

356
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:16,940
(Is it good?)

357
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:17,820
Good.

358
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,340
(It's tasty.)
Good.

359
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:18,640
(It's tasty.)

360
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,290
Good.
(It's tasty.)

361
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:19,900
(It's tasty.)

362
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,100
(Wow)

363
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,700
(Satisfied)
(Wow)

364
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,570
The potato is good too.
(Satisfied)

365
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:23,510
(Satisfied)

366
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,500
Isn't it good?

367
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:26,640
(It's really tasty.)

368
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,700
It's really tasty.
(It's really tasty.)

369
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,460
(It's really tasty.)

370
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,280
(Both are satisfied with everything of the dating.)

371
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,220
Superb.
(Both are satisfied with everything of the dating.)

372
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,540
(Both are satisfied with everything of the dating.)

373
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,700
Yesterday when we were playing jenga,

374
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,050
Yeah.

375
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,200
we talked about when a man could be called a cheater, right?

376
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,650
Yeah.

377
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:40,720
(The jenga game yesterday, when a man could be called cheat?)

378
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,090
When could we think a man is cheating?
(The jenga game yesterday, when a man could be called cheat?)

379
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:42,780
(The jenga game yesterday, when a man could be called cheat?)

380
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,280
If you can tell he likes another person.

381
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,700
I think just thinking about it is cheating too.

382
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,760
It's my standard.

383
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,770
But even if he's cheating on me, he's still very good to me.

384
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,160
In that case, I think it doesn't matter.

385
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:55,900
Why?

386
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,410
(Can't understand)
Why?

387
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,220
(Can't understand)

388
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,370
(What?)

389
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,340
So, I mean, I can accept it as long as it isn't emotional cheating.
(What?)

390
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,580
So, I mean, I can accept it as long as it isn't emotional cheating.

391
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,740
Ah, really?

392
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:02,890
(Jeong-hyeon's unusual speech caused a tumult among the men.)
Ah, really?

393
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,160
Oh, my god.
(Jeong-hyeon's unusual speech caused a tumult among the men.)

394
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,980
(Jeong-hyeon's unusual speech caused a tumult among the men.)

395
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:10,230
After talking with brothers with rich love experiences,

396
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,740
M-hm.

397
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,080
I was confused about the cheating stuff.

398
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,620
M-hm.

399
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,530
So I drew a conclusion that

400
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:15,780
I've never dated a man

401
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,610
(I've never dated a man I really like till now. That's why I would think like that.)
I've never dated a man

402
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,260
I really like till now.
(I've never dated a man I really like till now. That's why I would think like that.)

403
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,790
That's why I would think like that.
(I've never dated a man I really like till now. That's why I would think like that.)

404
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,260
(I've never dated a man I really like till now. That's why I would think like that.)

405
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,030
Your words show that you're still young.

406
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,450
It isn't a good thing, is it?

407
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,410
Good or bad aside,

408
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,030
you needn't do anything that's beyond your age.

409
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,680
It's best to do things that conform to your age.

410
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,840
Doesn't it seem childish if I do what people of 21 do?

411
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,390
No, it doesn't.

412
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:48,360
You don't need to think you must overcome all the frustrations in your life.

413
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,150
(It's okay to talk about the pains you're suffering.)

414
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,010
It's okay to talk about the pains you're suffering.
(It's okay to talk about the pains you're suffering.)

415
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,060
(It's okay to talk about the pains you're suffering.)

416
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,750
After moving into Men's House,

417
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,570
my values seem to be changing in a good way.

418
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,830
While playing jenga yesterday, everyone talked about his parents.

419
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,300
I envied everyone.

420
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,900
I even felt a little envious of Jeong-ho.

421
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,680
-Why? Because of coming out?
-It feels like...

422
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,960
I don't mean coming out.

423
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,870
I mean when I tell my parents I'm gay,

424
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,610
no matter they get angry,

425
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,330
or like your mom,

426
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,660
-Really? Do you feel that way?
-they accept it,

427
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,900
I think that could only happen

428
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,640
if I'm close with my parents.

429
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,290
In fact, when I told my parents,

430
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,090
no matter they accepted it or not,

431
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,610
despite the outcome,

432
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,620
I didn't feel close with my parents at all.

433
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,120
I was raised by my grandparents before I joined the army.

434
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,760
I probably know how it feels.

435
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,240
I used to live with my grandma,

436
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,460
so I know your feelings very well.

437
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,860
Because I've been there.

438
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,910
Though I don't know when it will become like that.

439
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,080
Mom still has a long time to spend with me.

440
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,130
But my grandma is different. She's already 80.

441
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,820
(The two get to know each other better through communication.)

442
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,980
I talked a lot with Jeong-hyeon in the past six days,

443
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,830
for it was the time for us being together.

444
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,110
I said something about myself.

445
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,770
I hope those things

446
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,230
won't make Jeong-hyeon uncomfortable

447
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,800
or embarrassed.

448
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,810
Jeong-hyeon told me lots of things too.

449
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,490
May I ask you a question that I've been curious about?

450
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,100
Yeah.

451
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,230
We had the Go-kart Race, right?

452
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,180
After you won the first place,

453
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,640
why did you choose Hyeok-jun as your roommate?

454
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,390
Just out of curiosity.

455
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,110
We're not in a relationship.

456
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,330
Could I just ask Chang-min such kind of question?

457
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,330
Honestly, I'm still not sure now.

458
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,650
After I won the first place,

459
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,420
I was going to write your name

460
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,010
(Curious)

461
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,810
for the assignment of rooms.
(Curious)

462
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,780
(Curious)

463
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,660
You were...

464
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,980
I felt you were determined to stay in the single room.

465
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,500
(Cheekbones Rise dramatically)

466
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,440
I was going to choose you,

467
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,060
but it's a little...

468
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,590
Obviously, you wanted the single room.

469
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:34,580
So,

470
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:34,820
(After hearing the real reason why Chang-min assigned the rooms in that way, Jeong-hyeon can't hide his emotions.)
So,

471
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,500
(After hearing the real reason why Chang-min assigned the rooms in that way, Jeong-hyeon can't hide his emotions.)

472
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,740
I chose the double room and my second choice, Hyeok-jun.

473
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,180
(Nodding)

474
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:43,720
(Ah, that was what you thought. Ha-ha.)

475
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,860
-Ah, that was what you thought.
-As a result, we both...
(Ah, that was what you thought. Ha-ha.)

476
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,770
I don't think it makes much sense

477
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,480
if we sleep in the same room.

478
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,420
But if I didn't ask the question,

479
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,130
I would've been unhappy even if it was over.

480
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:58,490

485
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,430
We just express in different ways,

486
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,920
but we think the same.

487
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:13,930
Chang-min talks a lot and he likes to joke.

488
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:17,020
Now I have no doubt about

489
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,270
my feeling for Chang-min,

the butterflies-in-my-stomach feeling.

491
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,290
It will never change.

492
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,430
I can't tell the exact time.

493
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,510
It was probably when we first got in the house and sat on the sofa together.

494
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,690
Jeong-hyeon sat in the middle and lead the conversation.

495
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,800
Brother, where are you from?

496
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,820
But it might seem unfair to you, brother.

497
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:46,100
At the beginning, I thought he did so probably because he felt burdened.

498
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,590
But that's actually who he is.

499
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,260
We're different at this point.

500
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,580
So, I began to be attracted to him.

501

We tried to find what we have in common.

516

Let me help you.

590
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,030
The date I really wanted to have was to

591
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:55,850
go to an amusement park in school uniform and take pictures like a couple,

592

holding or carrying each other. Anyone could tell we're a couple.

I've known what to do with my feelings for Hyeok-jun.

952
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:04,750
From yesterday…

953
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,180
Good.

954
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:06,990
No. From the day before yesterday,

955
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,450
I've given up my feelings for him.

956
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:10,990
Good.

957
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,360
But, Hyeok-jun feels confused, too.

958
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,120
He feels the same.

959
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,690
He likes someone,

960
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,670
and is also liked by some others.

961
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,690
So, he has not yet made up his mind.

962
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,920
I seem to

963
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,570
have bothered him, too.

964
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,380
But you've been true to your heart.

965
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,300
That's enough.

966
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,480
But what's the criterion?

967
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,870
The criterion for our date today?

968
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,720
It's for those who failed to get any match.

969
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,190
But,

970
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,550
are Chang-min and Jeong-hyeon successfully matched?

971
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,970
Yes.

972
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,720
-Really? Are you sure?
-I think so.

973
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,360
Does Chang-min like Jeong-hyeon?

974
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,370
Don't you know Chang-min called Jeong-hyeon last time?

975
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:53,860
Really?

976
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,530
(Really?)
Really?

977
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:54,540
Yeah.
(Really?)

978
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,380
(Yes)
Yeah.
(Really?)

979
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,900
Jeong-hyeon called Chang-min.

980
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,850
And Chang-min called Jeong-hyeon back that day.

981
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:02,620
They were successfully matched at the call time.

982
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,420
But I

983
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,720
shouldn't think this way though,

984
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,800
I can't believe it.

985
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,460
Why can't you believe it?

986
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,050
I don't know. I just can't believe it.

987
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,090
So, that's the case.

988
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,640
Hyeok-jun has been liking Chang-min from the beginning, right?

989
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:22,900
Right.

990
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,630
But, well…

991
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,040
Chang-min is really popular.

992
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,630
Really.

993
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,130
Indeed.

994
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:32,760
He is.

995
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:32,940
What are you doing here?

996
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,920
(Showing up suddenly)
What are you doing here?

997
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,020
Secret conversation.
(Showing up suddenly)
What are you doing here?

998
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,940
Secret conversation.

999
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,110
(Awkward)
Secret conversation.

1000
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,190
(Awkward)

1001
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:36,900
-We're talking about secrets.
-Seon-yul.
(Awkward)

1002
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:36,940
-We're talking about secrets.
-Seon-yul.

1003
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,900
(Seon-yul)
-We're talking about secrets.
-Seon-yul.

1004
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,210
Let's play the VR game.

1005
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
To experience "free fall"?

1006
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:44,170
I'm old and I'll leave after taking a break.

1007
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,380
You just need to wear the gear and sit there.

1008
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,660
(Come on)

1009
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:49,760
(Come on, you too.)

1010
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,740
Come on, you too.
(Come on, you too.)

1011
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:53,900
Chan-gyu, come and join us.

1012
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,120
(OK)
Chan-gyu, come and join us.

1013
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,500
OK.
(OK)
Chan-gyu, come and join us.

1014
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:54,760

OK.

Chan-gyu, come and join us.

(Men being called by Jeong-ho)

1016
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,560
Hyeok-jun, come on.
(Men being called by Jeong-ho)

1017
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,230
Wow, it's gonna be fun.

1018
00:32:59,670 --> 00:32:59,820
Cheers.

1019

One, two, three.

(Chan-gyu regards himself as the photographer of the group.)

1024

You look really nice.
(Chan-gyu regards himself as the photographer of the group.)

1025
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,040
(Really nice)

1026
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,990
Really nice.
(Really nice)

1027
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:08,820
Eun-chan, make a V sign, please.

(Eun-chan, make a V sign, please.)
Eun-chan, make a V sign, please.

1029
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:10,060
You look great.

(Cheese)
You look great.

You look great.
(Cheese)

1033
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,820
(Chan-gyu is trying to record today with photos.)

1034
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,060
(Aah!)

1035
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,650
(These men are enjoying these fun rides as teenagers do.)

1036
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,650
It's so funny.
(These men are enjoying these fun rides as teenagers do.)

1037
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:31,580
(A happy group date)

1038
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,340
(Will the date today change the mind of these men?)

1039
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,300
(After the date...)

1040
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,300
So tired. I want to take a shower.

1041
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,660
Me, too. I'm sleepy.

1042
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,920
(After much exercise, the men are tired out.)

1043
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,370
My stomach is growling.
(After much exercise, the men are tired out.)

I'm hungry
(After much exercise, the men are tired out.)

1048
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,500
What's this? There's something here.

1049
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,330
What's that?

1050
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,180
Ahhh!

1051
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,470
(Ahhh)
Ahhh!

1052
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,060
(Ahhh)

1053
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:02,580
I'll shower on the second floor.

1054
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,940
(The men on the third floor are going to take a bath.)
I'll shower on the second floor.

1055
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,300
OK, then I'll take the third floor.
(The men on the third floor are going to take a bath.)

1056
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,090
What's that?

1057
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,000
There's a letter on the bed.

1058
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,290
What?

1059
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:13,980
There is a letter in Hyeon's room.

1060
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,310
(Dashing)
There is a letter in Hyeon's room.

1066
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,429
What's this?

1067
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:34,820
(Oh, boy.)

(Confused)

Where is it?
(Confused)

1080
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,739
No letter for me!

(Sad)

1086

See? No letter for me.
(Sad)

1087
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:56,820
(No letters for him?)

1088
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:57,420
I have three.

Jeong-ho.

1092
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,580
(Hyeok-jun started from the first letter.)

1093
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,060
Jeong-ho really surprised me.

1094
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,820
I didn't expect him to write to me.

1095
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,440
I have chatted with everyone

1096
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:19,500
who I'm attracted to.

1097
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,330
(Hyeok-jun Eun-chan Jeong-hyeon)
who I'm attracted to.

1098
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,680
(Hyeok-jun Eun-chan Jeong-hyeon)

1099
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,300
But I don't know Hyeok-jun very well.
(Hyeok-jun Eun-chan Jeong-hyeon)

1100
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,380
(I take this as my last date with you so I plucked up the courage to write to you. I want to know you better this time.)
But I don't know Hyeok-jun very well.

1101
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,640
I don't know what kind of person he is.
(I take this as my last date with you so I plucked up the courage to write to you. I want to know you better this time.)

1102
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,060
So if possible, I want to know him better through a date.
(I take this as my last date with you so I plucked up the courage to write to you. I want to know you better this time.)

1103
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:37,380
So if possible, I want to know him better through a date.

1104
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,190
This is amazing.

1105
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:47,060
(Opening the second letter)

1106
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,740
(Hyeok-jun smiled after seeing the name on it.)

1107
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:59,020
(Hyeok-jun Eun-chan Jeong-ho Chan-gyu)

1108
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,220
(The man whose letter made Hyeok-jun smile is Seon-yul.)

1109
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,780
(As I've always told you, follow your heart and make a choice.)
(The man whose letter made Hyeok-jun smile is Seon-yul.)

1110
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,050
(As I've always told you, follow your heart and make a choice.)

1111
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:03,880
Follow your heart and make a choice.
(As I've always told you, follow your heart and make a choice.)

1112
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:03,890
(As I've always told you, follow your heart and make a choice.)

1113
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:04,740
Who you like matters the most.
(As I've always told you, follow your heart and make a choice.)

1114
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,040
(Don't feel burdened just because it was me who wrote to you.)
Who you like matters the most.

1115
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,590
(Don't feel burdened just because it was me who wrote to you.)

1116
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,780
Then it goes like this, "Don't feel burdened
(Don't feel burdened just because it was me who wrote to you.)

1117
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,210
(PS, stop biting your nails.)
Then it goes like this, "Don't feel burdened

1118
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,220
(PS, stop biting your nails.)

1119
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:15,250
just because I was the one who wrote to you."

1120
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,390
That's what I wrote.

1121
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:26,500
(Hyeok-jun opened the last letter.)

1122
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:33,220
(The third letter is from Eun-chan.)

1123
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,430
I have to tell Hyeok-jun something in person. So I put the letter in his box.

1124
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,590
(I may be a little selfish. I'm sorry if I make you uncomfortable. This is my last time being selfish. I'm sorry.)

1125
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,810
I may be a little selfish.
(I may be a little selfish. I'm sorry if I make you uncomfortable. This is my last time being selfish. I'm sorry.)

1126
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:44,690
I'm sorry if I make you uncomfortable.
(I may be a little selfish. I'm sorry if I make you uncomfortable. This is my last time being selfish. I'm sorry.)

1127
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,360
I'll hold back my feelings for you.

1128
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,690
I hope things won't get awkward between us.

1129
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,760
Just treat me as you usually do.

1130
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,560
I wrote the letter to tell him that.

1131
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,400
Aw, Eun-chan. He's too considerate.

1132
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:04,380
I found something here.

1133
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,210
(I found something here.)
I found something here.

1134
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:05,220
(I found something here.)

1135
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:05,740
(The quad room Only one letter on Jeong-ho's bed)
(I found something here.)

1136
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:05,920
(The quad room Only one letter on Jeong-ho's bed)

1137
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,760
What is it?
(The quad room Only one letter on Jeong-ho's bed)

1138
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,500
(The quad room Only one letter on Jeong-ho's bed)

1139
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,020
(Bang)

1140
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,580
(The men in the quad room are not aware of the existence of the letter.)

1141
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:11,770
(What will it be?)
(The men in the quad room are not aware of the existence of the letter.)

1142
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:12,580
What could it be?
(What will it be?)
(The men in the quad room are not aware of the existence of the letter.)

1143
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,290
Is that... the letter we wrote?

1144
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,240
-He's very polite.
-No. Maybe a task card.

1145
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,300
Could you open it? Let us have a look.

1146
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:20,380
Will you really open it?

1147
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,410
(Expecting)
Will you really open it?

1148
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,140
(Expecting)

1149
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:22,260
Let us have a look.
(Expecting)

1150
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:22,930
Let us have a look.

1151
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:23,180
Will you really open it?

1152
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,010
(Seon-yul's imitation of Eun-chan)
Will you really open it?

1153
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:24,820
(Seon-yul's imitation of Eun-chan)

1154
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:24,960
(I didn't do that!)

1155
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,190
I didn't do that!
(I didn't do that!)

1156
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:26,610
(LOL)

1157
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,600
Ha-ha.
(LOL)

1158
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,140
So they all know I was mocking you.
(LOL)

1159
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,010
So they all know I was mocking you.

1160
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:29,820
I didn't say it like that.

1161
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,720
(Anxious Fidgeted)
I didn't say it like that.

1162
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,860
(Anxious Fidgeted)

1163
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,040
But maybe it's a task only for you.

1164
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,960
Chan-gyu's name is on it.

1165
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,200
It looks like this letter is for Chan-gyu.

1166
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,240
Oh, my gosh.

1167
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,180
Is there nothing on my bed?

1168
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,540
Nothing at all? I also want letters.

1169
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,140
This is for Chan-gyu. It has his name on it.

1170
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,780
I think I know what this is.

1171
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,060
What is it?

1172
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,350
(Chan-gyu left the room with a cold expression.)
What is it?

1173
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,860
(Chan-gyu left the room with a cold expression.)

1174
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,060
A letter someone wrote to me yesterday. Hm?

1175
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,820
(A letter someone wrote to me yesterday. Hm?)
(What happened?)

1176
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,210
(What happened?)
A letter someone wrote to me yesterday. Hm?

1177
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:49,060
(What happened?)

1178
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,050
Ahh, did Chan-gyu write this letter to me?

1179
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:55,060
Right.

1180
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,820
(Right.)
Right.

1181
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,460
(Right.)

1182
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,700
Aww, Chan-gyu. I'm sorry.

1183
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:57,880
(Be considerate. Be considerate.)
Aww, Chan-gyu. I'm sorry.

1184
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,540
Be considerate. Be considerate.
(Be considerate. Be considerate.)

1185
00:37:59,540 --> 00:37:59,600
(Circling Embroiled)
Be considerate. Be considerate.
(Be considerate. Be considerate.)

1186
00:37:59,580 --> 00:37:59,600
(The men in the quad room are in panic after knowing what the letter is.)
(Circling Embroiled)

1187
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,500
We should go.
(The men in the quad room are in panic after knowing what the letter is.)
(Circling Embroiled)

1188
00:37:59,600 --> 00:37:59,580
(Circling Embroiled)

1189
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,580
(The men in the quad room are in panic after knowing what the letter is.)
(Circling Embroiled)

1190
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,820
Wait, my name Jeong-ho is not on it.

1191
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,520
Who should read this letter?

1192
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,630
What should I do?

1193
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:08,370
(Guilty)

1194
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,520
What to do?
(Guilty)

1195
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,000
(Guilty)

1196
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,420
I'm a terrible person.
(Guilty)

1197
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,850
I'm a terrible person.

1198
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,280
I held Chan-gyu's letter in front of everyone.

1199
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:19,780
And later I realized

1200
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,860
that Chan-gyu wrote this letter to me.

1201
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,930
So after Chan-gyu left.

1202
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,760
Just read the letter first.

1203
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,800
It must be for you.

1204
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,740
(Jeong-ho was left alone and opened the letter again.)

1205
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,580
(Feeling more guilty after reading the content)

1206
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,160
(Jeong-ho, I want to have a date with you.)

1207
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,460
Jeong-ho, I want to have a date with you.
(Jeong-ho, I want to have a date with you.)

1208
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,140
Because we've been chatting at home all the time.

1209
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:48,650
I want to go out and have a date with you alone.

1210
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:53,330
We can talk and have something nice.

1211
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,380
I've finished the letter.

1212
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,020
Where's Chan-gyu?

1213
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:57,920
(Sorry)
Where's Chan-gyu?

1214
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,100
In the bathroom.
(Sorry)
Where's Chan-gyu?

1215
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:58,860
In the bathroom.

1216
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,340
Chan-gyu.

1217
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:01,270
(Chan-gyu left the room after knowing the letter was written by himself.)

1218
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,960
I think I know what this is.
(Chan-gyu left the room after knowing the letter was written by himself.)

1219
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,020
(Chan-gyu left the room after knowing the letter was written by himself.)

1220
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,920
I should have left before I saw it.

1221
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,800
It doesn't matter that others saw it.

1222
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,750
But I almost broke down after I saw it myself.

1223
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,820
(Huff)

1224
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,220
I think I know what this is.

1225
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,980
Anyone would know that's the letter we wrote before.

1226
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:29,100
(Chan-gyu sat on the terrace for a long time.)

1227
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,900
Have all the letters been posted?

1228
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,490
Oh, no.

1229
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,010
Hyeok-jun.

1230
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,050
(In that case...)

1231
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:35,440
What's wrong?
(In that case...)

1232
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,700
Then Hyeok-jun must have read my letter.

1233
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,600
Right, that's the only possibility.

1234
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,650
No letter for us.

1235
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,770
No one chose us.

1236
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:46,160
That's why there's no letter on my bed. No letter at all.

1237
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:51,380
There was a letter in our quad room.

1238
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,570
Surely we couldn't read it together.

1239
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,000
And I noticed there was nothing at my position.

1240
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,660
So I kind of know what it is.

1241
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,700
He opened the letter and my name appeared.

1242
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,610
(Chan-gyu got emotionally stable and went downstairs to the first floor with Hyeon.)
He opened the letter and my name appeared.

1243
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,810
Everyone saw my name on it.
(Chan-gyu got emotionally stable and went downstairs to the first floor with Hyeon.)

1244
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,690
So they thought it was for me.
(Chan-gyu got emotionally stable and went downstairs to the first floor with Hyeon.)

1245
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,800
I still feel a little uncomfortable

1246
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,120
that no one chose me.

1247
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,170
To be honest, I've never been chosen even once.

1248
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:15,580
Neither have I.

1249
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:17,860
(This is sad.)

1250
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:21,050
This is sad.
(This is sad.)

1251
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,940
(This is sad.)

1252
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,270
I knew that no one would write to me.

1253
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:29,720
I didn't get a call for the first phone calling part, either.

1254
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,410
I thought it was not a big deal at that time.

1255
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:34,250
But this time I saw the letters when I passed by other rooms.

1256
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,000
And there was nothing in my room.

1257
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:39,390
So I'm losing confidence.

1258
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:40,700
But I still think I'm handsome.

1259
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,050
(But I still think I'm handsome.)
But I still think I'm handsome.

1260
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,500
(But I still think I'm handsome.)

1261
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:50,580
(No strength to cook. Pizza is their dinner.)

1262
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,980
(Bang)

1263
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,200
Peel this first.
(Bang)

1264
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,020
Is there someone at the door?

1265
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,380
Yeah.

1266
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,370
(All ears)

1267
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:58,800
The doorbell rang just now.
(All ears)

1268
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,720
Looks like they're back.

1269
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,440
Really?

1270
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,100
Are they back?

1271
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:01,740
I hate them.

1272
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,540
(I hate them.)
I hate them.

1273
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,500
Ha-ha.
(I hate them.)

1274
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,210
Ha-ha.

1275
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:04,580
I hate them.

1276
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,680
(Jeong-hyeon and Chang-min finished their date and came back.)
I hate them.

1277
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,980
Who said he hated us?
(Jeong-hyeon and Chang-min finished their date and came back.)

1278
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,920
-It's me.
-He's back.
(Jeong-hyeon and Chang-min finished their date and came back.)

1279
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,930
(Jeong-hyeon and Chang-min finished their date and came back.)

1280
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:09,510
That's me
(Jeong-hyeon and Chang-min finished their date and came back.)

1281
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,210
You even put on a coat.

1282
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,100
You're all dressed up.

1283
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:13,460
You're all dressed up.

1284
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,660
(Shy)
You're all dressed up.

1285
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:14,700
Have you had dinner?
(Shy)
You're all dressed up.

1286
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,700
Have you had dinner?

1287
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,660
Yeah, I have.

1288
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,250
So you've eaten outside.

1289
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:17,730
You've eaten outside?

1290
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:18,100
Then go take a bath.

1291
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,140
(Humph)
Then go take a bath.

1292
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,120
(Hyeon and Eun-chan made fun of them.)

1293
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,140
You're glowing.
(Hyeon and Eun-chan made fun of them.)

1294
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,990
(Radiant)
You're glowing.
(Hyeon and Eun-chan made fun of them.)

1295
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:22,180
What did you do?
(Radiant)
You're glowing.
(Hyeon and Eun-chan made fun of them.)

1296
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,850
What did you do?

1297
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,730
Took a talk.

1298
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,940
-We took a walk nearby.
-Really?

1299
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,910
We went to that place today.

1300
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,020
-The indoor playground?
-Yeah.

1301
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:30,720
Yeah, like that.

1302
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,700
It must be fun.

1303
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,060
-It must be interesting.
-Eat this.

1304
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,130
(Jealous as Hyeon is, he still cares for Jeong-hyeon.)
-It must be interesting.
-Eat this.

1305
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,100
(Try this)
(Jealous as Hyeon is, he still cares for Jeong-hyeon.)

1306
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:34,220
(Jealous as Hyeon is, he still cares for Jeong-hyeon.)

1307
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:36,150
(Jealous as Hyeon is, he still cares for Jeong-hyeon.)

1308
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,160
What is this?
(Jealous as Hyeon is, he still cares for Jeong-hyeon.)

1309
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:37,530
(Jealous as Hyeon is, he still cares for Jeong-hyeon.)

1310
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:37,780
It must be tasty.
(Jealous as Hyeon is, he still cares for Jeong-hyeon.)

1311
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,890
It must be tasty.

1312
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,340
(Wipe)

1313
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:40,460
(Oops)
(Wipe)

1314
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:40,980
Eww.
(Oops)

1315
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:40,350
(Oops)

1316
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:40,980
(Other fingers)
(Oops)

1317
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,540
Not with the dirty fingers.
(Other fingers)
(Oops)

1318
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:40,580
(Oops)

1319
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,200
(Phew)
Not with the dirty fingers.

1320
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:42,950
(Phew)

1321
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:43,660
I wouldn't wipe it with your clothes.
(Phew)

1322
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,610
I wouldn't wipe it with your clothes.

1323
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,070
Did you eat after you met?

1324
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:47,880
Yes.

1325
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:48,460
Then you're good without pizza.

1326
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,460
(Jealous)
Then you're good without pizza.

1327
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:50,610
(Yeah, it's okay.)

1328
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:51,750
Yeah, it's okay.
(Yeah, it's okay.)

1329
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:51,990
(Yeah, it's okay.)

1330
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:52,780
By the way, go check your bed.
(Yeah, it's okay.)

1331
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,460
By the way, go check your bed.

1332
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,230
There's something interesting on it.

1333
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:55,420
Oh, whatever.

1334
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,980
(Got up)
Oh, whatever.

1335
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:58,100
What is it?

1336
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:58,500
(Jeong-hyeon hurried to his room after hearing what Hyeon said.)
What is it?

1337
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:04,380
(Jeong-hyeon hurried to his room after hearing what Hyeon said.)

1338
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,030
what's this?

1339
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,980
Ah, is this the letter we wrote yesterday?

1340
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,080
Do you want to read it here?

1341
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:15,620
(Ah, no.)

1342
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,340
Ah, no.
(Ah, no.)

1343
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:16,350
(Ah, no.)

1344
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:16,980
Are you here to show off?
(Ah, no.)

1345
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,870
Are you here to show off?

1346
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,160
You took it here to show off, right?

1347
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,750
I'm sorry.

1348
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,010
I hate him.

1349
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,260
He's now a little annoying.

1350
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,460
(Joking)

1351
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,580
(The person wrote the letter to Jeong-hyeon)

1352
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:39,340
(is today's date, Chang-min)
(The person wrote the letter to Jeong-hyeon)

1353
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:39,990
(See you tomorrow.)

1354
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,250
I wrote the letter to Chang-min.
(See you tomorrow.)

1355
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,780
(See you tomorrow.)

1356
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,530
We should date one more time.

1357
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,580
I'm very happy.

1358
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,510
Really happy.

1359
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,450
(See you tomorrow.)

1360
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:51,940
I like him, like 90%.
(See you tomorrow.)

1361
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,840
I like him, like 90%.

1362
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,260
Or 100%?

1363
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:03,340
(Chang-min found the letters on the bed.)

1364
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:14,180
(Like Hyeok-jun, Chang-min also received three letters.)

1365
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:19,300
(The first letter is from Hyeon.)

1366
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,630
(Chang-min, I want to have a date with you.)

1367
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:23,940
I wrote the letter to Chang-min.
(Chang-min, I want to have a date with you.)

1368
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,800
I have a crush on him.

1369
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,620
And I want to know him better, so I wrote the letter.

1370
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:39,380
(Chang-min opened the next letter calmly.)

1371
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:45,420
(The second letter is from his roommate Hyeok-jun.)

1372
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,610
(We are roommates, but we don't talk much. LOL.)

1373
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:48,780
Actually, we don't talk much.
(We are roommates, but we don't talk much. LOL.)

1374
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,960
We are roommates now.

1375
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,890
I'm hoping we could get closer.

1376
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,560
So I wrote the letter.

1377
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:07,260
(Chang-min's expression is complicated and unfathomable.)

1378
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:12,700
(The third letter is from Jeong-hyeon.)

1379
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,920
(Date with me tomorrow. From Jeong-hyeon.)

1380
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,520
I wrote the letter to Chang-min.
(Date with me tomorrow. From Jeong-hyeon.)

1381
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,740
(Date with me tomorrow. From Jeong-hyeon.)

1382
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:19,900
I only have eyes for him now.

1383
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:20,690
(Hee hee)

1384
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:21,260
I mean it.
(Hee hee)

1385
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,620
(Hee hee)

1386
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:27,620
(Chang-min has also read Jeong-hyeon's letter)

1387
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:31,380
(What is going on in Chang-min's mind now?)

1388
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:34,860
(Shy)

1389
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:35,260
(Final results of the mailboxes)

1390
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,540
(Hyeok-jun Eun-chan Jeong-hyeon Chan-gyu
Seon-yul Chang-min Hyeon Jeong-ho)
(Final results of the mailboxes)

1391
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,660
(Jeong-hyeon Chang-min)
(Final results of the mailboxes)

1392
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,100
(Chang-min Jeong-hyeon Hyeok-jun Hyeon)
(Final results of the mailboxes)

1393
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,780
(Hyeok-jun Eun-chan Seon-yul Jeong-ho)
(Final results of the mailboxes)

1394
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,580
(Jeong-ho Chan-gyu)
(Final results of the mailboxes)

1395
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:46,100
Is Chang-min back?

1396
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,410
(The other men have started eating while Chang-min is reading letters.)
Is Chang-min back?

1397
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:47,610
(The other men have started eating while Chang-min is reading letters.)

1398
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:48,660
Yeah, he's back.
(The other men have started eating while Chang-min is reading letters.)

1399
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,320
What did you do? Went for a walk?
(The other men have started eating while Chang-min is reading letters.)

1400
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:50,870
Yes.
(The other men have started eating while Chang-min is reading letters.)

1401
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,630
We talked about something in the car.

1402
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:54,100
What?

1403
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,010
After we got back to the Men's House,

1404
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:57,770
we must get rid of the three Laughing Sisters.

1405
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:58,420
Who said that?

1406
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:58,640
(Laughing Sisters?)
Who said that?

1407
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,520
Did you tell him?
(Laughing Sisters?)

1408
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,060
Me.
(Laughing Sisters?)

1409
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:00,580
(Laughing Sisters?)

1410
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,980
(What do the Laughing Sisters refer to?)

1411
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:06,220
(Shy)
(What do the Laughing Sisters refer to?)

1412
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,780
(What do the Laughing Sisters refer to?)

1413
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,310
I have no idea.

1414
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:14,170
You may need to ask Hyeon.

1415
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:15,600
I don't know

1416
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,650
why I'm also one of the Laughing Sisters.

1417
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:18,860
This is easy to use.

1418
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:19,920
(The three men aren't aware of it but they are always together.)
This is easy to use.

1419
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,240
(The three men aren't aware of it but they are always together.)

1420
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:20,760
What?
(The three men aren't aware of it but they are always together.)

1421
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,680
This is easy to use
(The three men aren't aware of it but they are always together.)

1422
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,160
(The three men aren't aware of it but they are always together.)

1423
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,230
Cute.
(The three men aren't aware of it but they are always together.)

1424
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:23,450
(The three men aren't aware of it but they are always together.)

1425
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:24,260
Come on in.
(The three men aren't aware of it but they are always together.)

1426
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,220
(The three men aren't aware of it but they are always together.)

1427
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,500
(Looking around)
(The three men aren't aware of it but they are always together.)

1428
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:28,720
(The three men aren't aware of it but they are always together.)

1429
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,520
Come on in.
(The three men aren't aware of it but they are always together.)

1430
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,180
(Come in)
(The three men aren't aware of it but they are always together.)

1431
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:28,820
(The three men aren't aware of it but they are always together.)

1432
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:31,900
(The three men aren't aware of it but they are always together.)

1433
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,590
Jeong-hyeon, why did you come again?
(The three men aren't aware of it but they are always together.)

1434
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:34,980
Girls talk.

1435
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:35,130
(Only princesses can join you?)
Girls talk.

1436
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:36,280
Only princesses can join you?
(Only princesses can join you?)

1437
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,250
Yes, of course.
(Only princesses can join you?)

1438
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,280
(The single room once was the paradise for the three men.)

1439
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,780
I didn't know before 30.
(The single room once was the paradise for the three men.)

1440
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,420
(Always sit together in order)
(Hyeon Jeong-hyeon Eun-chan)

1441
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:49,540
(Hyeon Eun-chan Jeong-hyeon)
(Always sit together in order)

1442
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:48,390
One, two, three, him.
(Always sit together in order)

1443
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:49,150
(Always sit together in order)

1444
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,450
Why?
(Always sit together in order)

1445
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:46,630
(Always sit together in order)

1446
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:56,180
(Let's celebrate the first girls' band from His Man!)

1447
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,100
I'm sleepy.

1448
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,930
Trampolining is exhausting.

1449
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:00,980
What did you do for fun?

1450
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:01,600
(Curious)
What did you do for fun?

1451
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,170
Freeze Game and trampoline.
(Curious)

1452
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:04,260
Freeze Game?

1453
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:07,630
We played trampoline and rock climbing.

1454
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:10,240
He jumped off suddenly and was hung there.

1455
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,650
I feel so embarrassed.

1456
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:13,140
Yeah, it was a disaster.

1457
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,880
(Eun-chan is unforgettably active.)
Yeah, it was a disaster.

1458
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,800
Another goal achieved.
(Eun-chan is unforgettably active.)

1459
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,770
What is it?
(Eun-chan is unforgettably active.)

1460
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:19,130
We were playing Freeze Game on the trampoline.

1461
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:20,690
I needed to catch someone.

1462
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:22,160
It was fun, but everyone was tired.

1463
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,420
After all, we're not that young.

1464
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:23,900
(Feel hurt)
After all, we're not that young.

1465
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:24,160
(Feel hurt)

1466
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,070
So someone would be caught.
(Feel hurt)

1467
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:26,220
Suddenly, everyone stopped moving.

1468
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,060
(Feel hurt)
Suddenly, everyone stopped moving.

1469
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:29,010
Seeing that, I also stopped catching.
(Feel hurt)

1470
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:30,450
At this time, Hyeok-jun asked,

1471
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:31,440
"Is it over?"

1472
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,860
I still didn't move and replied, "Yeah, it's over.

1473
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,240
You hope I'd say that, right?" Then I jumped on him.

1474
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,090
He got terrified.

1475
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:36,590
And he cried, "Fry Kids!" But he should say "Freeze!"

1476
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:38,780
Fry Kids!

1477
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:40,550
It should be "Freeze!"

1478
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,030
All of sudden, "Fry Kids!"

1479
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,160
You jumped to me suddenly. What else could I do?

1480
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,760
But did you really say "Fry Kids"?

1481
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:48,210
It must be fun.

1482
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:49,740
-See you later.
-Okay.

1483
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,070
(The dinner is over as they chat and eat happily.)
-See you later.
-Okay.

1484
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:53,150
Thank you.
(The dinner is over as they chat and eat happily.)

1485
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:54,500
(The dinner is over as they chat and eat happily.)

1486
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,060
Brother, could I wear your clothes and give them back later?

1487
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:57,820
Sure.

1488
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:04,620
(Jeong-hyeon took Hyeon's school uniform.)

1489
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,380
I want to have a school uniform date with Chang-min.

1490
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:10,950
Will he be happy to see me

1491
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:11,460
in school uniform?

1492
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,190
Chang-min said he liked youthful beauty.

1493
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,590
So I want to have a school uniform date with him.

1494
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,050
(Hyeon put on the uniform and came to the first floor.)

1495
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,880
Whose school uniform is that?
(Hyeon put on the uniform and came to the first floor.)

1496
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,540
(Hyeon put on the uniform and came to the first floor.)

1497
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:22,980
Hyeon's.

1498
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,560
(Staring)
Hyeon's.

1499
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:24,580
I used to wear a turtle neck inside.
(Staring)
Hyeon's.

1500
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:27,780
I used to wear a turtle neck inside.

1501
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:31,280
Yeah, we used to dress that way and wear a letter necklace.

1502
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,790
Right. We often dressed like that.

1503
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:34,790
It was trendy at that time.

1504
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:35,270
Right.

1505
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:36,880
Necklaces with Chinese characters or English letters.

1506
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,560
Totally.

1507
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:40,360
Could you send me a few photos?

1508
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,310
Okay.

1509
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,410
What photos did you take?

1510
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:44,230
Can I have a look?

1511
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:45,860
Let me see what you got.

1512
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,010
This is fun.

1513
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:50,700
I always want to play this.

1514
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:50,780
(Curious)
I always want to play this.

1516

Who took this?
(Curious)

1517
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:52,980
-Us.
-Can I have a look?
(Curious)

-Us.
-Can I have a look?

1519
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:54,740
Put on the VR equipment and you'll feel the 3D effect.

1520
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,100
(Nodding)
Put on the VR equipment and you'll feel the 3D effect.

1521
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,490
This is Seon-yul.

1522
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:00,580
On the right is Hyeok-jun.

1523
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,190
Right.

1524
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:02,870
Who's on the far left?

1525
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:05,480
They look like high school students sitting there.

1526
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,090
Their faces are covered. Of course they look like high school students.

1527
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:10,980
This is fun.

1528
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:11,250
(A fun VR game that one stands to play)

1529
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,420
I also played Iron Man.
(A fun VR game that one stands to play)

1530
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,760
Did you? I should also have played it.
(A fun VR game that one stands to play)

1531
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,690
I felt cool.

1532
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:18,830
There was wind to make you feel real.

1533
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,250
It was pleasantly cool. Because I was sweating then.

1534
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:21,790
Right.

1535
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:23,890
Yeah, right. Very cool.

1536
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,670
You two look cute in this picture.

1537
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:30,140
I think so too.

1538
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,490
Who?

1539
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:33,970
Seon-yul and Chan-gyu.

1540
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:35,890
What a lovely picture.

1541
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:36,530
Yeah.

1542
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,840
Seon-yul's photos all look good.

1543
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:46,940
(More chatting about the dating epilogue)

1544

It's a fine day today.

It's a fine day today.

00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:12,380
(Hyeok-jun came to the coffee shop alone.)

1551

(Happy)

1556

Hello.

1557
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:39,740
(The conversation time for these men to know each other better)

1558
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:43,380
(Chang-min, the first one Hyeok-jun is to chat with)

1559
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:45,620
You already arrived.

1560
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:46,880
What took you so long?

1561
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,230
(Embarrassing Shy)

1562
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:51,120
What did you do just now?
(Embarrassing Shy)

1563
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:51,440
Pardon?

1564
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,320
What did you do just now?

1565
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,330
I was just in the Men's House.

1566
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:55,900
I stayed there for a while and came here.

1567
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,060
(Unfamiliar)
I stayed there for a while and came here.

1568
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,230
(Unfamiliar)

1569
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:58,390
Ah, OK.
(Unfamiliar)

1570
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,300
We are roommates.

1571
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:04,900
But it seems like we are still not close.

1572
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:15,020
(Although they are roommates, they hardly talk.)

1573
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:23,180
(Don't know why the two just can't get closer.)

1574
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:26,170
So I wrote you the letter.

1575
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,130
I seem to talk to you the least.

1576
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:32,360
Yes.

1577
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:36,240
We both are not talkative.

1578
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,000
Yeah.

1579
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,510
We are not extroverts either.

1580
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:41,380
So this is why our relationship is like this now.

1581
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,060
(Nodding)

1582
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:51,750
(Silence between them)

1583
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:52,060
When you received my letter,
(Silence between them)

1584
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:52,970
When you received my letter,

1585
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:55,300
would you feel burdened?

1586
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,380
I also called you before.

1587
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:02,820
(Facing Hyeok-jun's continuous hints, how will Chang-min respond...)

1588
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,570
I was kind of burdened,

1589
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:13,260
because I do like Jeong-hyeon more.

1590
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:17,080
I don't think I will change my choice.

1591
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:21,580
(The first time to know Chang-min's feelings)

1592
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:27,330
But you chose me as your roommate before.

1593
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:30,200
I really want to ask you why.

1594
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:39,090
I was about to live with Jeong-hyeon in the double room.

1595
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:43,660
(Jeong-hyeon)

1596
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:47,120
But Jeong-hyeon insisted that he wanted to live in the single room.

1597
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:47,640
Ah, did he?

1598
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,210
When I asked him,

1599
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:49,780
he said he wanted to live in a single room so much.

1600
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:50,980
(Got to know the truth of choosing roommates now)
he said he wanted to live in a single room so much.

1601
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,790
He kept saying that.
(Got to know the truth of choosing roommates now)

1602
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,270
Honestly, in the Men's House,

1603
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:58,170
I have feelings for you and Jeong-hyeon only.

1604
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:06,020
I was thinking that we could talk more if we lived together in a double room.

1605
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:09,360
But we do not talk much.

1606
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:14,260
(Bitter)

1607
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:18,120
I always wanted to ask you about this in private and now I have a chance.

1608
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,170
I felt the same especially when I was in the quad room.

1609
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:25,400
Two people need to sleep in a bed in the quad room.

1610
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:26,430
But even so,

1611
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:28,540
I didn't really talk to my roommate.

1612
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:33,060
So I decided not to attach much significance to the whole room-sharing thing.

1613
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,080
Ah, I see.

1614
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,600
I just want to pick roommates that I can live comfortably with.

1615
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:39,880
I made the choice based on that thought.

1616
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:41,830
I see.

1617
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:49,620
But when I heard that

1618
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:54,200
you were going to have a date with Jeong-hyeon,

1619
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,670
I didn't expect that at all.

1620
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:56,300
Why?

1621
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:57,790
Wasn't that obvious?

1622
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:58,740
I have no idea.

1623
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,030
Maybe because I live upstairs.

1624
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,440
I didn't expect that at all.

1625
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:06,480
I thought you would have a date with Hyeon.

1626
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:12,260
It started with the bacon invitation on the second day.

1627
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:15,360
Jeong-hyeon and I dated

1628
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,400
only because Jeong-hyeon was the only one left

1629
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,890
But in fact, I wanted to have a date with him at the very beginning.

1630
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:27,760
I see.

1631
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:31,180
I don't think I will change my mind.

1632
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:35,020
So I chose Jeong-hyeon all the time.

1633
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:36,820
(Finally confirmed Chang-min's mind after so many questions)
So I chose Jeong-hyeon all the time.

1634
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,580
(Finally confirmed Chang-min's mind after so many questions)

1635
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:42,380
I didn't expect the story to go like this.

1636
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,290
(I didn't expect the story to go like this.)
I didn't expect the story to go like this.

1637
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:47,510
(I didn't expect the story to go like this.)

1638
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:48,360
Now I see.
(I didn't expect the story to go like this.)

1639
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,100
(I didn't expect the story to go like this.)

1640
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,510
What Chang-min said

1641
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,220
was a great blow to me.

1642
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,940
Hearing that Chang-min mentioned Jeong-hyeon,

1643
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:08,470
I felt a sense of relief in my heart.

1644
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:09,860
Honestly it hurts a bit,

1645
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,390
(Honestly, it hurts a bit, like there is a hole in my heart.)
Honestly it hurts a bit,

1646
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:13,500
like there is a hole in my heart.
(Honestly, it hurts a bit, like there is a hole in my heart.)

1647
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:20,220
(The conversation with Chang-min unfolded in an unexpected direction.)

1648
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:25,340
(The complicated feelings that can not be hidden.)

1649
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,540
(Men's House during the conversation)

1650
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:29,860
Ah, so bored.

1651
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,160
(Jeong-hyeon and Eun-chan stayed at home without receiving the invitation for conversation.)

1652
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,280
Where are the others?
(Jeong-hyeon and Eun-chan stayed at home without receiving the invitation for conversation.)

1653
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,300
(Jeong-hyeon and Eun-chan stayed at home without receiving the invitation for conversation.)

1654
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:34,600
Only the two of us.

1655
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,580
Chang-min is not here, either?

1656
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:35,600
(Yes.)
Chang-min is not here, either?

1657
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,570
(Yes.)

1658
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:36,620
Where is he?
(Yes.)

1659
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:37,380
(Where are they?)
Where is he?

1660
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:37,620
(Where are they?)

1661
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:39,340
(I don't know either.)
(Where are they?)

1662
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,820
(Sad)

1663
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:46,900
(Jeong-hyeon returned to his room alone.)

1664
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:54,700
(Jeong-hyeon's feeling became complicated because Chang-min disappeared without saying a word.)

1665
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:58,620
(At this time, Chang-min came back after finishing the conversation with Hyeok-jun.)

1666
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,460
(Peek)

1667
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:12,700
(Chang-min returned to his room directly without talking to Jeong-hyeon.)

1668
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:19,140
(Chang-min came to the kitchen for making a midnight meal.)

1669
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,110
The conversation has lasted longer than I thought.

1670
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:23,980
What?

1671
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:24,860
It has lasted longer than I thought.

1672
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:25,300
(Jeong-hyeon followed Chang-min to the kitchen.)
It has lasted longer than I thought.

1673
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,050
That's right.
(Jeong-hyeon followed Chang-min to the kitchen.)

1674
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:27,130
Why does it take them so long?
(Jeong-hyeon followed Chang-min to the kitchen.)

1675
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:27,660
(Jeong-hyeon followed Chang-min to the kitchen.)

1676
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:30,100
What are you going to cook today?

1677
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,810
I am going to cook casually.

1678
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:32,670
(Joking)

1679
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:35,870
Put things in and boil them or something.
(Joking)

1680
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:40,300
(Jeong-hyeon who didn't respond to Chang-min's joke)

1681
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:46,740
(Chang-min who has not yet sensed Jeong-hyeon's mood)

1682
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:47,900
You want to do something?

1683
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:49,590
Help me chop the scallion.

1684
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:51,530
Chop scallions?

1685
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:58,140
(Jeong-hyeon took the scallion as Chang-min said.)

1686
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:03,140
(No energy)

1687
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:08,780
Yes, also onions, chop like this.

1688
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:14,100
(Unlike the usual, Jeong-hyeon didn't talk when doing things.)

1689
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:15,900
(M-hm)

1690
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,180
(Chang-min felt flustered due to the unusual atmosphere.)
(M-hm)

1691
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,460
(Chang-min felt flustered due to the unusual atmosphere.)

1692
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,780
(Fry)

1693
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:26,140
(Depressed)

1694
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:29,970
But why didn't you talk with me?

1695
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,940
(Jeong-hyeon started a topic to break the ice.)

1696
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:34,480
Did I tell you?

1697
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,210
(All ears)

1698
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:36,900
I received three letters.
(All ears)

1699
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,770
I received three letters.

1700
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:43,340
So I need to talk to one of the people I didn't choose.

1701
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,090
But we two had a date, right?

1702
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:48,360
Because I chose you and you chose me.

1703
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,400
Because I chose you and you chose me.

1704
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:52,570
(Chang-min explained calmly.)

1705
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:53,990
So I didn't have a date with anyone else.
(Chang-min explained calmly.)

1706
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:55,420
(Chang-min explained calmly.)

1707
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:58,140
(Hee hee)

1708
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:59,300
(After hearing Chang-min's explanation, Jeong-hyeon felt much better.)
(Hee hee)

1709
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,860
(After hearing Chang-min's explanation, Jeong-hyeon felt much better.)

1710
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,660

1711
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:07,950
Maybe I have some talent with knives.

1712
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:08,720
(Oh)

1713
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:09,840
Oh.
(Oh)

1714
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,620
(Satisfied)

1715
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:15,540
(The sweetness spreading in the kitchen in these two men)

1716
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,980
(On the other side, Hyeok-jun is alone after Chang-min left.)

1717
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:26,180
(Frustrated)

1718
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:31,700
(Hyeok-jun is still confused.)

1719
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:35,500
(Footsteps come from a distance.)
(Hyeok-jun is still confused.)

1720
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:37,980
(Who is he?)

1721
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:42,750
(The second one who talks to Hyeok-jun is...)

1722
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,080
Who will be there?
(The second one who talks to Hyeok-jun is...)

1723
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,100
(The second one who talks to Hyeok-jun is...)

1724
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,140
(Laughing)

1725
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:49,920
It's so embarrassing.

1726
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:51,380
Nice to meet you, Mr. Hyeok-jun.

1727
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:52,600
(Nice to meet you, Mr. Hyeok-jun.)
Nice to meet you, Mr. Hyeok-jun.

1728
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,660
(Nice to meet you, Mr. Hyeok-jun.)

1729

(Seon-yul, the former roommate in the double room)

1730
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,090
Yes.

1731
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:58,580
Yesterday,

1732
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,600
I wrote a letter to you. Did you read it today?

1733
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,230
Yes, I did, I read it today.

1734
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:10,150
How do you feel?

1735
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:15,280
To be honest, I know that you'd write to me.

1736
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,420
I just can feel it.

1737
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,690
Then how did you feel when you did receive the letter as you expected?

1738
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:19,540
It's great.

1739
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:20,260
(It's great.)
It's great.

1740
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:20,840
Great?
(It's great.)

1741
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,060
(It's great.)

1742
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,300
Didn't you feel burdened?

1743
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:25,700
I mean, we are kind of close.

1744
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,590
Why would I feel burdened?

1745
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,960
I did not feel that way.

1746
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:31,900
Uh-huh.

1747
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,530
(So lucky)

1748
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:34,080
Yeah.
(So lucky)

1749
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:34,580
But I did not write to you.
(So lucky)

1750
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:36,490
But I did not write to you.

1751
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,030
How do you feel?

1752
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,160
I'm fine.

1753
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,840
I am not sad.

1754
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:50,750
Because I've always been there for you.

1755
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:52,680
And you've always been there for me, right?

1756
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,020
Of course I will be there for you.

1757
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:53,780
(Of course I will be there for you.)
Of course I will be there for you.

1758
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,740
(Of course I will be there for you.)

1759
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,870
But I have to tell you,

1760
00:58:57,870 --> 00:59:00,120
when I wrote the letter yesterday,

1761
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,420
I thought a lot.

1762
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:05,490
Ah, I hope you wouldn't feel burdened

1763
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:08,580
or get worried. I'm afraid you would.

1764
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:10,320
We're each other's second choice.

1765
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:15,060
I'm super happy because I'm your second choice.

1766
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,550
Why would you feel happy about it?

1767
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:18,960
It seems that you and I have different views.

1768
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,330
I think, even if someone considers me the second choice,

1769
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:25,940
it at least proves that he has feelings for me, right?

1770
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:26,780
I am grateful.

1771
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:27,880
Until now,

1772
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,770
I've called Chang-min twice.

1773
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:35,940
And then I wrote a letter to you the next day.

1774
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:38,570
But from another perspective,

1775
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:40,140
I changed my mind that fast. Would you think I am kind of fickle?

1776
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,380
(Worrying that you will think I am kind of casual.)

1778
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:44,530
Yes.

1779
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:48,320
To be honest,

1780
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,700
every moment,

1781
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:52,580
from the day we reassigned the room,

1782
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:59,090
I've been thinking about you longer than you thought.

1783
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:00,580
So I am surprised.

1784
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:02,860
I feel the same as you do.

1785
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:04,330
(I feel the same as you do.)
I feel the same as you do.

1786

(I feel the same as you do.)

1787
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:05,620
I realized your importance after we were not roommates.
(I feel the same as you do.)

1788
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:12,640
I realized your importance after we were not roommates.

1789
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,940
But I am not sure if it's just because you are a friend to me,

(Two men who start feeling different things from how they felt before.)

1795
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:26,320
Or... I am not sure.

1797

1800
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:35,900
So, it means,

1801
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,120
to some extent,

1802
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:43,090
I can make you confused.

1803
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,970
Call me confident but

1804
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:48,380
I've always thought that

1805
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:54,450
if I can have a date with you,

1806
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:57,180
I want to hold your hand.

1807

01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:08,630
If we hold hands, you feel disgusted,

1813
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,790
then,

1814
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:12,100
I guess I can decide

1815
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:16,540
(Then it should stop.)

Yes.

1865
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,320
So I didn't expect that you would write to me.

1866
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:11,780
(Well, I see.)

1867
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,730
I've always wanted to have a one-on-one talk with you.

1868
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:18,510
But I never got a chance.

1869
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:19,330
That's right.

1870
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:21,470
There was always someone else in your room.

1871
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,840
It's pretty obvious that

1872
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,980
you always have many people around.

1873
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:30,260
(Jeong-ho who kept giving hints to Hyeok-jun)

1874
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:35,540
(Wanted to talk with Hyeok-jun)

1875
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:40,500
(Look straight at it)

1876
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,250
Just how?

1877
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:47,060
How what?

1878
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:48,850
How charming!

1879
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:51,760
I also want to know you better.

1880
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:51,940
You are the most eye-catching.

1881
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:53,780
(You are the most eye-catching.)
You are the most eye-catching.

1882
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:55,580
(You are the most eye-catching.)

1883
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,590
Well, I see.

1884
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:03,700
(Shy)

1885
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:05,260
Honestly,

1886
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:08,070
I wanted to talk to you when you first got here.

1887
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:12,160
But you looked cold and I felt it was hard to get close to you.

1888
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,370
I felt like that.

1889
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:19,040
You've always said that I am special.

1890
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:20,580
Do you remember?

1891
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:21,460
(Yes.)
Yes.

1892
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:21,880
So,
(Yes.)

1893
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:22,380
I just wondered if there was something strange about me.
(Yes.)

1894
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:23,990
I just wondered if there was something strange about me.

1895
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:27,160
And then I thought, did Jeong-ho dislike me?

1896
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,060
I meant good.

1897
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:28,580
Really?

1898
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:29,910
So,

1899
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,940
here's what I like about you.

1900
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:34,970
You are very shy and delicate,

1901
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:35,710
like this.

1902
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:39,800
So I think you are very kind, I like kind people.

1903
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,710
It makes me feel you are innocent.

1904
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:42,800
For me,

1905
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:43,460
it's very special.

1906
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:45,030
(It's very special.)
it's very special.

1907
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:46,790
Special.
(It's very special.)

1908
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:47,020
(It's very special.)

1909
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:48,020
Kind of.
(It's very special.)

1910
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:49,010
It means good.

1911
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:51,740
So,

1912
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:52,750
I am a little curious.

1913
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:56,080
It's not all of you. There must be something more about you.

1914
01:04:58,370 --> 01:05:00,590
As I see it, you are kind of slow.

1915
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:03,520
Just a little.

1916
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,950
It's cute.

1917
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:05,400
Ah, really?

1918
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,100
Yes.

1919
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:12,180
It's not a negative comment. It makes me want to take care of you.

1920
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:14,200
So I've taken care of you secretly. Do you know that?

1921
01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:17,090
Have you felt that, even a little?

1922
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:19,420
I can feel it.

1923
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,820
At moments like this.

1924
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,510
The first time we made eye contact.

1925
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:28,010
When I was doing something

1926
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:28,250
(Hyeok-jun would make eye contact with Jeong-ho every time he made mistakes.)

1927
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:29,670
and made mistakes.
(Hyeok-jun would make eye contact with Jeong-ho every time he made mistakes.)

1928
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:31,640
As long as I looked up, we would make eye contact.
(Hyeok-jun would make eye contact with Jeong-ho every time he made mistakes.)

1929
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:32,000
(Hyeok-jun would make eye contact with Jeong-ho every time he made mistakes.)

1930
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,890
You would say nothing and look at me.
(Hyeok-jun would make eye contact with Jeong-ho every time he made mistakes.)

1931
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:36,140
It happened once.

1932
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:37,200
(Even Hyeok-jun's tiny actions were being watched by Jeong-ho.)
It happened once.

1933
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:42,100
(Even Hyeok-jun's tiny actions were being watched by Jeong-ho.)

1934
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:44,300
I didn't expect him to gaze at me like that.

1935
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,320
I use chopsticks in a strange way.

1936
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,850
He knows this.

1937
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:52,530
I keep spilling all over my clothes when I eat.

1938
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:54,690
He said he knew it, too.

1939
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:57,890
I'm lucky he likes me the way I am.

1940
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:04,620
(Jeong-ho finally got the chance to confess.)

1941
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:06,330
What's your ideal type, brother?

1942
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:08,270
(Well, me?)

1943
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:08,920
Me?
(Well, me?)

1944
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:09,660
(Well, me?)

1945
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:12,540
(Curious)

1946
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:14,160
I hope he is without double eyelids.

1947
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:16,220
(OK)

1948
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:17,900
(I don't have double-edged eyelids either.)
(OK)

1949
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,100
And I hope he is not too short.

1950
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:20,370
(Observing)
And I hope he is not too short.

1951
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:21,540
(Observing)

1952
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,830
(It's a pity.)

1953
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:24,420
OK.
(It's a pity.)

1954
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:26,580
Because it's an ideal type. Just ideal.

1955
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:28,710
It's good to tell the truth.

1956
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,430
And I am kind of...

1957
01:06:30,810 --> 01:06:32,050
As for personality,

1958
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:34,720
I prefer someone who makes me feel at ease

1959
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,380
when we're together.

1960
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:40,120
Someone who makes me feel at ease and likes me more than I like him.

1961
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,540
Ah, really?

1962
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:44,460
(People who can make him at ease)

1963
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:45,410
And you?

1964
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,420
Is there anyone you like in the Men's House?

1965
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:50,540
It's you.

1966
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:51,430
(It's you.)
It's you.

1967
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:52,540
(It's you.)

1968
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:54,740
(Smile)

1969
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:58,710
And you?

1970
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:01,420
I think I've changed my mind after what happened today.

1971
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:05,390
(I think I've changed my mind after what happened today.)
I think I've changed my mind after what happened today.

1972
01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:07,140
(I think I've changed my mind after what happened today.)

1973
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,820
(Pondering)

1974
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:12,860
That's great, then it might be me.

1975
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:14,230
(That's great, then it might be me.)
That's great, then it might be me.

1976
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:16,300
(That's great, then it might be me.)

1977
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:17,060
You are cute.

1978
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:17,380
(Cute)
You are cute.

1979
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:19,140
(Cute)

1980
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:20,180
I was just attracted by you.

1981
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:21,370
(Attracted by you)
I was just attracted by you.

1982
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:21,580
(Attracted by you)

1983
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:22,060
How would I keep selling myself to you?
(Attracted by you)

1984
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:23,860
How would I keep selling myself to you?

1985
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:26,340
What is that feeling?

1986
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:27,460
(What is that feeling?)
What is that feeling?

1987
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:28,900
(What is that feeling?)

1988
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:30,730
I just keep selling myself no matter what.

1989
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,690
Brother Hyeok-jun said he liked the person who recommend himself.

1990
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:36,680
Then I just said it all without thinking twice.

1991
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:42,800
Jeong-ho kept expressing his feelings to me. Honestly, I feel good.

1992
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:47,290
So sad.

1993
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,480
What? Aren't you feeling well?

1994
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:55,360
No, no.

1995
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:57,040
Shall we hug in the end?

1996
01:07:58,540 --> 01:07:58,600
(That's great.)

1997
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,090
That's great.
(That's great.)

1998
01:07:59,090 --> 01:08:00,300
(That's great.)

1999
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:04,620
((Hug) Without hesitation)

2000
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:06,170
(Pat)

2001
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:06,260
It's so nice to talk to you.
(Pat)

2002
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:06,340
It's so nice to talk to you.

2003
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,140
(It's so nice to talk with you.)
It's so nice to talk to you.

2004
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:07,700
(It's so nice to talk with you.)

2005
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:12,440
It's so nice to talk to you.

2006
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:14,560
(What feelings are the two men feeling now?)

2007
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,450
It's so nice to talk to you.
(What feelings are the two men feeling now?)

2008
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:20,380
(What feelings are the two men feeling now?)

2009
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:22,979
You smell so good, brother.

2010
01:08:23,149 --> 01:08:24,240
Ah, really?

2011
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:30,700
When Jeong-ho asked me to hug in the end,

2012
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:32,930
My heart kind of

2013
01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:33,580
fluttered.

2014
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:35,120
(Kind of fluttered)
fluttered.

2015
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:35,859
(Kind of fluttered)

2016
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:42,740
(What kind of emotional changes are happening to them?)

2017
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:44,580
(His Man)

2018
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:47,710
Do we have to pack everything?

2019
01:08:48,189 --> 01:08:50,590
Yes, just leave some clothes for tomorrow.

2020
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:53,390
Tomorrow we will not be here.

2021
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:57,060
It feels so real now that we've started packing.

2022
01:08:57,899 --> 01:09:00,960
There is not much time left indeed.

2023
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,700
I feel so sad and excited as well.

2024
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,160
This is our last night in the dorm.

2025
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:21,100
I feel so sad.

2026
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,130
Me too.

2027
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:24,420
But we will spend time together tomorrow.

2028
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:25,210
Yes.

2029
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,840
Good night.

2030
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:29,689
Good night.

2031
01:09:29,859 --> 01:09:31,040
Good night.

2032
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,140
It's been a long day.

2033
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:34,410
I'm going to turn off the light.

2034
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:36,529
I'm going to turn off the light.

2035
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,350
I'm going to sleep.
