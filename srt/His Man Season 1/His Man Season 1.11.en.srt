00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,540
What if you get many other opportunities?

162
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,310
I have no idea. I don't know yet.

163
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,620
(Hyeok-jun and Jeong-ho come out a little late.)

164
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,580
(A glance)

165
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,380
Write a random number like 112.

166
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,640
I feel regretful that I didn't get the chance.

167
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,280
I'll take the paper to write a letter.

168
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,460
What's on one's mind is only known to himself.

169
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,740
(Hesitating)
What's on one's mind is only known to himself.

170
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,380
(Hesitating)

171
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,720
I think there's nothing more disturbing than that.

172
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,280
I don't know.

173
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,820
What if I put it in the mailbox of someone else?

174
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,100
I thought a lot and I was so distressed.

175
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,370
My heat hurt a little.

176
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,440
Our real phone numbers?

177
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,290
I'm still not sure about your feelings.

178
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,000
But I really mean it.

179
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,410
I worried for a long time last night.

180
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,420
I must express all my feelings.

181
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,020
That's what I thought.

182
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,940
(Time to express feelings to the men they want to be a couple with.)

183
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:33,940
(Who do the eight men have in their hearts?)

184
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,060
I didn't regret any single moment.

185
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,860
I don't regret my choice.

186
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,640
I don't know who to choose between the two.

187
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,390
I felt a little uneasy.

188
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,200
What if he doesn't give me his number?

189
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:15,980
I was thinking, "Who shall I choose?"

190
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,600
I want to talk more with him.

191
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,480
From the very beginning...

192
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,750
Shall I give it to the friend who I want to get his number?

193
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,720
It isn't over yet.

194
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,240
Who knows?

195
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,780
The feeling of attachment

196
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,400
will only become stronger other than change.

197
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,260
(What are the men's choices?)

198
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,620
(Grips)

199
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:08,260
(The last moment of the eight days and seven nights)

200
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:14,220
(The only man in the men's hearts)

201
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:24,580
(Steps forward to convey his real feelings)

202
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,940
(Prudent)

203
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:49,180
(Time to make sincere choices)

204
00:09:53,820 --> 00:10:04,180
(Will the man I'm yearning for feel the same about me?)

205
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:21,580
(Time to reveal the final results)

206
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,780
(Who did the men leave their phone numbers to?)

207
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:34,340
(Rule of the final choices
The men who become couples have each other's real numbers in their mailboxes. The men who fail to make couples have wrong numbers.)

208
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:40,700
(Rule of the final choices
Call the number on the letter in your mailbox. If the man at the other end answers it, you'll become a couple.)

209
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:46,540
(Will the men's numbers be sent to each other?)

210
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,380
(The eight special yet ordinary men who are looking for true love)

211
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:53,220
I'm so nervous.

212
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:53,680
(Their final choices are?)
I'm so nervous.

213
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,630
I'm so nervous.
(Their final choices are?)

214
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,260
(Their final choices are?)

215
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,500
Do we really have to make the final choices now?

216
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,670
I feel uneasy about it.

217
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,330
I feel uneasy about it.

218
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,860
Oh, my heart is trembling with tension.

219
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:07,900
What should I do?

220
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:13,840
I'm so nervous.

221
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:28,700
(The men look more nervous than ever.)

222
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,460
(The time to check their mailboxes finally comes.)

223
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:56,780
(The first to check the mailbox is Chan-gyu.)

224
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,600
What to do?

225
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,700
(Opens the mailbox carefully.)

226
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,340
(The letter in Chan-gyu's mailbox)

227
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,040
He's making the call.

228
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,990
Just make the call like that?

229
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:50,780
(Makes the call nervously)

230
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,980
(Who did Chan-gyu leave his number to?)

231
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,120
(Chan-gyu is attracted to Seon-yul after the one-on-one dating.)

232
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,630
It doesn't look like Pikachu.
(Chan-gyu is attracted to Seon-yul after the one-on-one dating.)

233
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,580
(Chan-gyu is attracted to Seon-yul after the one-on-one dating.)

234
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,760
I'll take one and let's share the other one.

235
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,090
You and me?

236
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,740
(Patting)

237
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,180
(Liking to fight in jest, Seon-yul responds actively to Chan-gyu's jokes.)

238
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,340
I'm here to sleep with you.

239
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,140
Let's sleep.

240
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,230
(The two become close quickly.)
Let's sleep.

241
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,190
Sleep? Come over.
(The two become close quickly.)

242
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,020
(The two become close quickly.)

243
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,620
(Seon-yul often amuses introverted Chan-gyu.)

244
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,060
(But)

245
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,200
No, I only flirt with someone because I like him.

246
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,820
How could I flirt with someone I don't like?

247
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,540
(Seon-yul's feeling for Chan-gyu is friendship rather than love.)

248
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,140
(After that, Jeong-ho moved into Men's House.)

249
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,830
Could you come and have a look?

250
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:46,700
Do I look better with my bangs being put down like this

251
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,100
(Since they became roommates in the quad room, Chan-gyu and Jeong-ho have spent a lot of time together.)
Do I look better with my bangs being put down like this

252
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,700
(Since they became roommates in the quad room, Chan-gyu and Jeong-ho have spent a lot of time together.)

253
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,880
or kept up like this?

254
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:53,820
You look great even without bangs.

255
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,170
(You look great even without bangs.)
You look great even without bangs.

256
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,460
(You look great even without bangs.)

257
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,650
The quad room is the only room where we can sleep together

258
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,660
in one bed.

259
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:00,960
(Right?)
in one bed.

260
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,500
Right?
(Right?)

261
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:01,620
(Nodding Nodding)
Right?
(Right?)

262
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,860
(Nodding Nodding)

263
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,350
We sleep in the same bed.

264
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,540
Who do you like best?

265
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,260
You're the one I like best.

266
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,120
Do you know I like another man?

267
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:14,660
I know.

268
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,140
(I know.)
I know.

269
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,020
(I know.)

270
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,940
(Chan-gyu is turned down again.)

271
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:29,260
(In the end, who's the man remaining in Chan-gyu's heart?)

272
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:41,980
(Which man will Chan-gyu leave his number to?)

273
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,100
The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment.

274
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,760
(The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment.)
The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment.

275
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,540
(The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment.)

276
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,740
(It looks like he failed.)

277
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,610
What should I do?

278
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,980
(Regretful)

279
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,250
I left my number to Jeong-ho.

280
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,620
(But Chan-gyu didn't receive Jeong-ho's number.)

281
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,360
OK. It's just...

282
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,990
Though I don't know who it will be,

283
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,640
I hope he'll leave with a good man.

284
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,740
(Jeong-ho who cares about Chan-gyu all the time.)

285
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,300
(Chan-gyu, your mailbox is empty.)

286
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,100
(Chan-gyu fails to find a match in the end.)

287
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,380
(Bitter)
(Chan-gyu fails to find a match in the end.)

288
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,220
(The men become more nervous seeing depressed Chan-gyu who didn't get through.)

289
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,010
I'm so nervous.

290
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,930
No, but what should we do?

291
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,340
(The second one, Hyeon)

292
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,850
I'm so nervous.

293
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,260
(Hyeon checks his mailbox.)

294
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,700
(Who did Hyeon leave his number to?)

295
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,430
Hello.

296
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,350
He's a little shy.

297
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,040
(The two men in Hyeon's heart)

298
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,760
Really?
(The two men in Hyeon's heart)

299
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,830
Get up quickly.

300
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:23,900
It's time to get ready.

301
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,420
(Sometimes they are like lovers; sometimes close friends.)

302
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:31,180
Let's go on a date later.

303
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,470
(Let's go on a date later.)
Let's go on a date later.

304
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,220
(Let's go on a date later.)

305
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,870
Who do you want to chat with next time?

306
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,850
The man I'm chatting with now.

307
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,460
No, no.

308
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,900
(Hyeok-jun who went on the first date with him)

309
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,500
(And)

310
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:52,180
(Hyeon who expressed his feelings to Chang-min by letter)

311
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,300
(Can't you tell the Cupid arrow between us?)

312
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,010
It's exactly like this, this, and this.
(Can't you tell the Cupid arrow between us?)

313
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,010
(Close Intimate)
(Can't you tell the Cupid arrow between us?)

314
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,370
But as I grow older...
(Close Intimate)
(Can't you tell the Cupid arrow between us?)

315
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:54,700
(Can't you tell the Cupid arrow between us?)

316
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:01,180
(Hyeon and Chang-min become closer and closer as they spend more time together.)

317
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,300
We're going to stay in one room.

318
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,840
You guys do whatever you want.

319
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,099
(Please hug me.)

320
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:04,800
Please hug me.
(Please hug me.)

321
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,640
(Please hug me.)

322
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:05,780
Can you just hug me?
(Please hug me.)

323
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,920
Can you just hug me?

324
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,400
Cuddle and sleep?

325
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:10,180
No, I'm shy.

326
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,900
(No, I'm shy.)
No, I'm shy.

327
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,060
(No, I'm shy.)

328
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:20,660
(It's hard to tell who Hyeon will leave his number to.)

329
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:38,420
(Will the man respond to Hyeon's affection?)

330
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:50,740
(Makes the call nervously)

331
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:02,780
The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment.

332
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,760
(The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment.)
The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment.

333
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,380
(The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment.)

334
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,200
(Q. Who did you give your number to?)

335
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,420
Me? I gave it to Hyeok-jun.
(Q. Who did you give your number to?)

336
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,100
(Q. Who did you give your number to?)

337
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,320
And why is that?

338
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,550
At the campfire party,

339
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,080
when we talked about what our most memorable date was,

340
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,410
I figured my most memorable date was with Hyeok-jun.

341
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,540
It was the most fun one as well.

342
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,980
That's what I think.

343
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:38,060
Can you do it?

344
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,090
(The most memorable moment for Hyeon is his first date with Hyeok-jun.)
Can you do it?

345
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,730
(The most memorable moment for Hyeon is his first date with Hyeok-jun.)

346
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,640
You look a bit troubled.
(The most memorable moment for Hyeon is his first date with Hyeok-jun.)

347
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,500
No, I can do it. Everything's good.
(The most memorable moment for Hyeon is his first date with Hyeok-jun.)

348
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,160
I seriously doubt it.
(The most memorable moment for Hyeon is his first date with Hyeok-jun.)

349
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,110
All is good.
(The most memorable moment for Hyeon is his first date with Hyeok-jun.)

350
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,540
(Wow)

351
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,580
(Wow)

352
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,060
(Wow)
(Wow)

353
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:50,700
Wow. It's so amazing.

354
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,290
(Hyeon & Hyeok-jun who have shared unforgettable moments)
Wow. It's so amazing.

355
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,140
(Hyeon & Hyeok-jun who have shared unforgettable moments)

356
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,670
If we didn't have that talk about the most memorable date,

357
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,430
I'd probably choose Chang-min.

358
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,530
But after we talked about it,

359
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,480
I felt like I have more feelings for Hyeok-jun.

360
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,260
(Hyeon Your inbox is empty.)

361
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,640
This is a little cruel.

362
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,500
(The third one Chang-min)

363
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:34,140
(Checking his inbox nervously)

364
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,550
People's mind is just like flipping hands.

365
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,800
It just keeps changing.

366
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,430
So I was worried that what if there's no call for me.

367
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,460
(The two have had countless memories together within the week.)

368
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,610
You need to press harder here.
(The two have had countless memories together within the week.)

369
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,700
(The two have had countless memories together within the week.)

370
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:03,300
We got to get this thing up.

371
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,060
(Sometimes caring, other times naughty)
We got to get this thing up.

372
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,700
(Sometimes caring, other times naughty)

373
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,100
It looks swollen here. It swelled up.

374
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,900
(Jeong-hyeon who always makes others want to look after him)
It looks swollen here. It swelled up.

375
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,660
Yes.

376
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,510
(The two who understand each other better than anyone else)
Yes.

377
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,000
(The two who understand each other better than anyone else)

378
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,720
Looking good.
(The two who understand each other better than anyone else)

379
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,220
(The two who understand each other better than anyone else)

380
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:19,860
You must be so happy, right?

381
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,830
(You must be so happy.)
You must be so happy, right?

382
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,350
What?
(You must be so happy.)

383
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,460
You must be so happy.
(You must be so happy.)

384
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,700
(Did Chang-min choose Jeong-hyeon?)

385
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,100
(Hyeon and Chang-min who somehow got close)

386
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,860
Let's go check out the room.

I'll help you with this.

390
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:44,100
(Chang-min who is always very amiable with Hyeon)

391
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,100
Do you need help?

392
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,450
It's okay. I can do it.

393
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:47,540
I wanted to help you.

394

395
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,420
(I wanted to help you.)

396
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,690
What do you think of…

397
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:54,920
(A workaholic like me?)

398
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,640
A workaholic like me?
(A workaholic like me?)

00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,380
I'm fine with it.

401
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,140
Yeah?

402
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,470
You can always find the time if you like each other.

403
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:05,780
You can create the place to be together as well.

(You can create the place to be together as well.)

Yeah.

(Will Chang-min choose Jeong-hyeon?)

410
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:26,020
(Or will he make a couple with Hyeon?)
(Will Chang-min choose Jeong-hyeon?)

411
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,300
(The call went through.)

412
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,780
(Startled)

413
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:01,800
Do I need to answer it?

414
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:09,640
(Hello?)

415
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,350

(Chang-min and Jeong-hyeon who gave their numbers to each other)

418
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,440
Let's go.
(Chang-min and Jeong-hyeon who gave their numbers to each other)

419

(The two have now confirmed each other's feelings.)

424
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,050
So shy.

425
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,340
It even got me shy.

426
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,030
(Bye-bye)

I feel so shy.

436
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,090
The others might have left a fake number.

437
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,410
They won't answer even if you call.

438
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,590
Ah, really?

439
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,240
Only I got shy?

440
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,360
The weather is so nice.

441
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,000
Hello, everyone.

442
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,110
(His Man The first couple Chang-min and Jeong-hyeon)

443
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,910
The weather is great.
(His Man The first couple Chang-min and Jeong-hyeon)

444
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:02,200
(His Man The first couple Chang-min and Jeong-hyeon)

445

(His Man The first couple Chang-min and Jeong-hyeon)

447
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,740
When can we even take a walk like this again?
(His Man The first couple Chang-min and Jeong-hyeon)

448
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,290
Yeah.
(His Man The first couple Chang-min and Jeong-hyeon)

449
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,260
(His Man The first couple Chang-min and Jeong-hyeon)

450
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,290
I want to have a date with Chang-min first.

451
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,480
It's not super great, but still not bad.

452
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,920
My favorite guy called me.

453
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,330
I'm so happy today.

454
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,760
Now my affection for Chang-min is probably at 80%.

455
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,060
I don't want to get separated from him.

456
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,820
90%... Or 100%?

457
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,530
I have zero doubt about it. It will never change.

458
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,050
Chang-min is the only one I can see now.

(Jeong-hyeon who grew more and more fond of Chang-min)

460
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,390
This is where you should go in weather like this.

461
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,570
So beautiful.

462
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,410
So beautiful.

463
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,220
Have you brought food?

464
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:58,750
(Rapport)
Have you brought food?

465

Wonderful.

471
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,390
Is there meat in it?

472
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,270
In Stuffed Fried Tofu Pockets?

473
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,690
You are eating way too much meat.

474
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,410
I made only vegetable-stuffed ones.

475
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:12,570
(Unhappy)

476
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,580
Then I don't want it.
(Unhappy)

477
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,580
(Unhappy)

478
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,780
Don't be picky about your food.

479
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,400
You can make Stuffed Fried Tofu Pockets?

480
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,740
I'm a great cook.

481
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,070
Very good at cooking.

482
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,600
True.

483
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,710
Let's keep the same pace.

484
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,380
Let's walk back to Seoul like this.

485
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,580
Cute.

486
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,860
(What's Chang-min's alias in your contacts?)

487
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,610
I've already saved him in my contacts.

488
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,030
As puppy.

489
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,550
He's really like one of those big dogs.

490
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,630
(What's Jeong-hyeon's alias in your contacts?)

491
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:51,070
Lee Jeong-hyeon. I already saved it.
(What's Jeong-hyeon's alias in your contacts?)

492
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,620
(What's Jeong-hyeon's alias in your contacts?)

493
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,110
There might be pet names after we start dating.

494
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,390
I'll just change it then.

495
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,690
(What kind of pet name will you have for Jeong-hyeon?)

496
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:03,830
What pet name can I give him?
(What kind of pet name will you have for Jeong-hyeon?)

497
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,220
(What kind of pet name will you have for Jeong-hyeon?)

498
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,130
Wicked Witch of the West. She gets melted by water.

499
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,050
She gets cursed when touching the water.

500
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:25,020
(His Man Couple number 1 Jeong-hyeon Chang-min.)

501
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,020
(The fourth one Eun-chan)

502
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:39,540
(Checking his inbox nervously)

503
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:15,180
(The man who has entered Eun-chan's heart since the first day)

504
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:19,070
I have special feelings for someone.

505
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,910
(Eun-chan who always expresses his feelings honestly)

506
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,650
Thank you. Where did he go?
(Eun-chan who always expresses his feelings honestly)

507
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,100
Why didn't you just call?

508
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,350
(Hyeon-jun has always been one of his options.)
Why didn't you just call?

509
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,110
(Hyeon-jun has always been one of his options.)

510
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,560
We could talk for 30 seconds yesterday.
(Hyeon-jun has always been one of his options.)

511
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:32,690
Brother.

512
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:33,780
Yeah.

513
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,130
There's still time. Can you say something more?

514
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,580
What do you want to hear?

515
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,080
I just want to hear…

516
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,040
Hyeok-jun must have someone he likes too.

517
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,460
But I was too selfish and put pressure on him.

518
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,820
(He's worried that his affection might seem selfish.)
But I was too selfish and put pressure on him.

519
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,660
But I was too selfish and put pressure on him.

(Eun-chan didn't get a response for his affection.)

521

(Eun-chan didn't get a response for his affection.)

522
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,420
I've tried to put an end to it since yesterday.

523
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,160
You are always very honest about your feelings.

524
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,620
That's enough.

525
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,220
(Seon-yul who supported Eun-chan when he was in pain)
That's enough.

526
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,390
(Seon-yul who supported Eun-chan when he was in pain)

527
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,590
You are here to help me?
(Seon-yul who supported Eun-chan when he was in pain)

528
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,200
Yeah.
(Seon-yul who supported Eun-chan when he was in pain)

529
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,480
You haven't eaten much, right?

530
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,880
I ate a lot.

531
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,950
Go have some.

532
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,430
I'm already full.

533
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,860
But after thinking about it.

534
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,840
I think the first date is the most memorable.

535
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,220
I would remember that moment forever.

536
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,390
Very cute.

537
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,620
(Who did this straightforward guy Eun-chan give his number to?)

538
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:42,980
(Did he also give his number to Eun-chan?)

539
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:45,940
The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment.

540

(The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment.)

541
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,340
(The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment.)

542
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,900
(Eun-chan goes back to his position with a bitter feeling.)

543
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,240
(Eun-chan Your inbox is empty.)

544
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,450
I got the message saying "your inbox is empty".
(Eun-chan Your inbox is empty.)

545
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,100
My goodness. It's so brutal…

546
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,910
And miserable… No, I have become the miserable heroine.

547
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,360
I already knew

548
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,210
that he wouldn't respond anymore.

549
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:33,190
I gave my number to Seon-yul.

550
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,140
(Why did Eun-chan choose Seon-yul?)

551
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:45,320
It's not like Seon-yul and I have to become a couple.

552
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,910
You need a successful match to know his real contact information

553
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:52,010
and social media account.

554
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:59,000
I still want to stay in contact with Seon-yul.

555
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,400
So I chose him.

556

00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,940
(Is the number in Seon-yul's inbox real?)

560
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:24,620
There is a phone number.

561
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,850
(There is a phone number.)
There is a phone number.

Do you want to go for a walk, Chan-gyu?

567
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:50,900
Chang-min is going to sleep.

Not trying very hard to dress up.

576
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,660

Do you want to try?

589
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,520
Like this.

590
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,220

Did I talk to Hyeok-jun too late?

597
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,740
Was I too late to see Hyeok-jun?

598
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,740
So it's a pity for me.

599
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,790

and experienced this earlier,

604
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,960
Then maybe Hyeok-jun would have seen me

605
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:55,070
as someone more important than a friend. It is a pity.

606

00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,280
We haven't talked much.
(Hyeok-jun called Chang-min twice before.)

625
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,450
Hyeok-jun?
(Hyeok-jun called Chang-min twice before.)

626
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,820
(Hyeok-jun called Chang-min twice before.)

627
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:16,020
I seem to like Jeong-hyeon more.

628
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,670
So I always choose him.

629
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,460
So actually I was sad,

630
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,980
(So actually I was sad,)
So actually I was sad,

631
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:23,980
(like there was a hole in my heart.)
(So actually I was sad,)

632
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,930
like there was a hole in my heart.
(like there was a hole in my heart.)
(So actually I was sad,)

633
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:23,940
(So actually I was sad,)

634
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:26,820
(like there was a hole in my heart.)
(So actually I was sad,)

635
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,120
Jeong-ho…

636
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,340
(Jeong-ho chose Hyeok-jun when he was sad.)

637
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,650
Jeong-ho is completely out of my expectation.

638
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,690
I haven't expected that he would write to me.

639
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,280
I think you're a little sloppy.

640
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:47,000
-I think this part of you is cute.
-Really?

641
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,020
It makes me want to take care of you.

642
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,090
Is there anyone you like in the Men's House?

643
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:53,940
It's you.

644
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,210
(It's you.)
It's you.

645
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,180
(It's you.)

646
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,300
(Hee hee)

647
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:01,700
After today,

648
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,310
(I think I've changed my mind after today.)
After today,

649
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:03,530
(I think I've changed my mind after today.)

650
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,720
I think I've changed my mind.
(I think I've changed my mind after today.)

651
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,420
(I think I've changed my mind after today.)

652
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:10,040
(The distance between them shortened rapidly.)

653
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,800
Are you riding close to me on purpose?
(The distance between them shortened rapidly.)

654
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,260
(The distance between them shortened rapidly.)

655
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,889
That's a pretty dangerous distance.
(The distance between them shortened rapidly.)

656
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:17,120
I want to stay next to you but it's dangerous to get too close.
(The distance between them shortened rapidly.)

657
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,520
So we need to keep a distance.
(The distance between them shortened rapidly.)

658
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,750
I like you.

659
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:29,100
(Jeong-ho actively showed his love to Hyeok-jun.)

660
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:30,520
(You are really really attractive to me.)

661
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,469
You are really really attractive to me.
(You are really really attractive to me.)

662
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:37,860
(You are really really attractive to me.)

663
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,690
I'd like to change the order of my call.

664
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:49,239
I was just worried.

665
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,659
When I was asked to choose who I liked in the beginning,

666
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:57,160
(I like you right from the start.)
When I was asked to choose who I liked in the beginning,

667
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,600
-I chose you.
-Really?
(I like you right from the start.)

668
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,540
(I like you right from the start.)

669
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:07,380
(Jeong-ho fell in love with Hyeok-jun without others knowing.)

670
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,720
We are so close now.

671
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,340
If you don't choose me in the end, I would really...

672
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,410
You would really?

673
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,920
I don't know, but it would be so terrible.

674
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,530
Brother, you won't do that, right?

675
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:37,060
(Can Hyeok-jun and Jeong-ho end up as a couple?)

676
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:55,580
(A phone call that isn't answered.)

677
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,460
(Surprised)

678
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:07,790
Hello.

679
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:14,240
Let's go?

680
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:24,410
Let's go.

681
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,230
Holding hands.

682
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:33,630
(Holding hands)

683
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,560
Holding hands.
(Holding hands)

684
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,980
(Holding hands)

685
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,320
(Hyeok-jun and Jeong-ho gave each other the phone number.)

686
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,150
So embarrassing.
(Hyeok-jun and Jeong-ho gave each other the phone number.)

687
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:45,300
(Hyeok-jun and Jeong-ho gave each other the phone number.)

688
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,130
I know.
(Hyeok-jun and Jeong-ho gave each other the phone number.)

689
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,300
(Hyeok-jun and Jeong-ho gave each other the phone number.)

690
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,370
With Jeong-ho,

691
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,840
I can feel my heart fluttering.

692
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,840
Thank you for making me feel this way.

693
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,270
So I called you.

694
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:05,840
I was 100% sure that I wanted to give my phone number to Hyeok-jun.

695
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:10,360
It isn't that he has to give me his because I gave him mine.

696
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:16,410
I hope he gave me his because he likes me.

697
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:20,310
Why are you laughing?

698
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,460
Why are you laughing?

699
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,550
Because you are handsome.

700
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,330
What? I mean it.

701
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,900
It's a lovely day!

702
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,020
Yes.

703
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,560
I want to ride bikes and kayaks.

704
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,330
Yes.

705
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,140
(What is Hyeok-Jun's contact name?)

706
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,310
I'm going to save it as his full name.

707
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:48,680
For now, I want to save it as Gwon Hyeok-jun.

708
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,190
Note it in Gwon Hyeok-jun.

709
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,100
Because I want to call his name more.

710
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,330
(What is Jeong-ho's contact name?)

711
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:00,010
Note it in Jeong-ho first.
(What is Jeong-ho's contact name?)

712
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,540
(What is Jeong-ho's contact name?)

713
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:02,340
What are you doing? How are you?

714
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,650
(What will the first message be?)
What are you doing? How are you?

715
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,080
(What will the first message be?)

716
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,920
Or how was your sleep?
(What will the first message be?)

717
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,130
(What will the first message be?)

718
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:12,120
Let's meet someday.
(What will the first message be?)

719
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,250
Can we hang out today? Something like these.
(What will the first message be?)

720
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,220
(What will the first message be?)

721
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,540
(Chang-min Jeong-hyeon)

722
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:21,600
(Oh, what happened?)

723
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,620
Oh, what happened?
(Oh, what happened?)

724
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,060
What？
(Oh, what happened?)

725
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,460
(Oh, what happened?)

726
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,420
(Ah)

727
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,140
(Wow)
(Ah)

728
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,740
Crazy!

729
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,670
What? When did they get together?

730
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,490
I have no idea.

731
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,860
When did you two start the relationship?

732
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,930
Congratulations!

733
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,030
But you guys look so good together.

734
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,300
-Really?
-Very good indeed.

735
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,340
You guys are more eye-catching.

736
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,060
Not at all.

737
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:02,100
(The second couple in His Men Hyeok-jun Jeong-ho)

738
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:06,940
Congratulations, kids!

739
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,150
(No congratulations, kids)
Congratulations, kids!

740
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,260
(No congratulations, kids)

Congratulations, kids!
(No congratulations, kids)

742

(No congratulations, kids)
Congratulations, kids!

743
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:12,100
-So the four of us are couples?
-Yeah.

744
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,160
(So the four of us are couples?)
-So the four of us are couples?
-Yeah.

745
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,100
(So the four of us are couples?)

746
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:15,380
Can I tear this?

747
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,740
(Can I tear this?)
Can I tear this?

748
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:24,940
I hope they all fall into the river.

749
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,270
(I hope they all fall into the river.)
I hope they all fall into the river.

750
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:26,460
I hope you all fall into the river.
(I hope they all fall into the river.)
I hope they all fall into the river.

751
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,620
(I hope you all fall into the river.)
I hope you all fall into the river.

752
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:27,820
I'm gonna go push them down.

753
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,780
(I'm gonna go push them down.)
I'm gonna go push them down.

754
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,730
(I'm gonna go push them down.)

755

I'm gonna go push them down.
(I'm gonna go push them down.)

756
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:30,720
(Just go down.)
I'm gonna go push them down.
(I'm gonna go push them down.)

757
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,020
(Just go down.)

758
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,450
The message is so hurtful.

759
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,040
I guess you all got the message?

760
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,950
Yes, yes.

761
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:38,140
I got the message.

762
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,060
(Message received)
I got the message.

763
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:39,540
(Message received)

764
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:40,980
I am moved.

765
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:44,100
You have a letter from Eun-chan in your mailbox.

766
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,260
I will always remember that you chose me.

767
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,860
(Thanks)
I will always remember that you chose me.

768
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,300
We can't see the content?

769
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,700
I really think it's a pity.

770
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:57,590
It is the rule that we cannot know the phone number, and I can accept that.

771
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,740
But I sincerely hope that

772
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,130
Seon-yul can see the content of the letter I gave him.

773
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,020
But in the end, he didn't get to read it.

774
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,550
That's what hurts me most.

775
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,530
I thought for a long time.

776
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:14,870
I also thought about giving it to someone other than Hyeok-jun.

777
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:17,580
But if it does make a match,

778
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,890
it's like there's no connection between us.

779
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,700
So it is just a match.

780
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,500
I don't think it is good.

781
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,190
And it's impolite as well.

782
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:31,160
But Eun-Chan was a real comfort to me.

783
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,340
I hope we can keep our friendship in the future.

784
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:37,360
It's OK.

785
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,860
I'm pretty anyway.

786
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,940
(I'm pretty anyway.)
I'm pretty anyway.

787
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,020
(Bye-bye)

788
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,150
Bye-bye.
(Bye-bye)

789
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,620
Bye-bye.

790
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,450
(Wave wave)
Bye-bye.

791
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:46,030
(Wave wave)

792
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:46,780
Let's go.
(Wave wave)

793
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,540
Let's go, there is no need to stay here.

794
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,960
(Let's go, there is no need to stay here.)
Let's go, there is no need to stay here.

795
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,590
Is it over?
(Let's go, there is no need to stay here.)

796
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:50,940
We need to meet someone new.

797
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,200
(We need to meet someone new.)
We need to meet someone new.

798
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:52,640
(We need to meet someone new.)

799
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,270
Is it the end?
(We need to meet someone new.)

800
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:53,460
I also need to date someone.

801
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,790
(I also need to date someone.)
I also need to date someone.

802
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:55,500
(I also need to date someone.)

803
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:55,980
It is really "other's love" now.

804
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,360
(It is really "other's love" now.)
It is really "other's love" now.

805
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:57,540
Send them to date.
(It is really "other's love" now.)
It is really "other's love" now.

806
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:57,780
Send them to date.

807
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,620
(Send them to date.)
Send them to date.

808
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,850
Bye.

809
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,170
Let's go, we can go find a partner by ourselves.

810
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,150
I want to go find my love.

811
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:07,220
I'm tired of witnessing other people's love.

812
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,850
(I'm tired of witnessing other people's love.)
I'm tired of witnessing other people's love.

813
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:09,460
(I'm tired of witnessing other people's love.)

814
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:13,540
(Thank all the audience for watching His Man during this period.)

815
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,300
(His Man)

816
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,380
(Are you happy in the Men's House?)

817
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,720
The eight of us are all friends.

818
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,500
Everyone is nice. I'm glad to meet them.

819
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,170
Though it's not easy to gather us all,

820
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:32,530
we might get together from time to time in the future.

821
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:36,680
When we talked about whether we would cry on the last day,

822
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,760
I was like, "Come on,

823
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,030
why would we cry?"

824
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,410
But it turned out I shed tears first.

825
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,490
I said in tears that I didn't want to leave.

826
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,760
I did that first.

827
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:50,470
Now I understand why people cry

828
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:53,160
after the wrap of a film, a drama or a variety.

829
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,810
In this process,

830
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,220
I know myself better.

831
00:41:59,630 --> 00:41:59,660
This is a very good experience.

832
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,540
(This is a very good experience.)
This is a very good experience.

833
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,340
I don't think a successful pairing here

834
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,760
can make them a real couple.

835
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:08,780
One of them may end up as my boyfriend.

836
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,300
(One of them may end up as my boyfriend.)
One of them may end up as my boyfriend.

837
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,120
Anyway, I just didn't find my Mr. Right here.

838
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,090
I'll find him after I get back to my life.

839
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,780
(What do you want to say to the other seven men?)

840
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:25,150
You must come to watch my performance.

841
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:25,260
I'll go to visit you, too.

842
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,290
(I'll go to visit you, too.)
I'll go to visit you, too.

843
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:27,940
(I'll go to visit you, too.)

844
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,490
I learned a lot about love

845
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:34,420
instead of getting love.

846
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:38,450
I learned about new love styles I was unfamiliar with before.

847
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,970
I felt many times that I did some improper things.

848
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,600
I learned to do self-reflection.

849
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,970
After this program ends,

850
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,340
I'll get back to my normal life.

851
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:49,220
It feels like waking up

852
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,650
(It feels like waking up from a long dream.)
It feels like waking up

853
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:53,150
(It feels like waking up from a long dream.)

854
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,680
from a long dream.
(It feels like waking up from a long dream.)

855
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:57,090
Everything is like a dream.

856
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,340
(Sobbing)

857
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:24,660
(Eun-chan can't speak.)

858
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:40,980
(Gave all his heart away but ended up with pity)

859
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:15,740
(What is the meaning of Eun-chan's tears?)

860
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:15,940
(Swollen)

861
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,180
This is a very precious experience.
(Swollen)

862
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,310
The memory and experience

863
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,690
only belong to the eight of us,

864
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:24,460
or the nine of us?

865
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,470
(Or the nine of us?)
or the nine of us?

866
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:25,780
Jeong-hyeon sometimes can split.
(Or the nine of us?)
or the nine of us?

867
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,260
Jeong-hyeon sometimes can split.

868
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,950
(Jeong-hyeon sometimes can split. That confused me.)
Jeong-hyeon sometimes can split.

869
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:29,900
That confused me.
(Jeong-hyeon sometimes can split. That confused me.)

870
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,060
(Jeong-hyeon sometimes can split. That confused me.)

871
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:31,100
There are only eight of us.
(Jeong-hyeon sometimes can split. That confused me.)

872
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,830
There are only eight of us.

873
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,250
I can't believe that it ends just like this.

874
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,500
I don't want to go back to my old life.

875
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,830
That's why I cried.

876
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:42,690
Everyone is nice.

877
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:48,970
If I want to write my life story

878
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:50,710
related to youth,

879
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:53,460
this show may be my best memory.

880
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,640
In the past, I valued friendship over love.

881
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:00,320
After meeting Chang-min here,

882
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,660
I might think differently.

883
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,060
I'm looking forward to the future.

884
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:04,950
(Excited)
I'm looking forward to the future.

885
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:06,340
(Excited)

886
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,860
I met many nice people here.

887
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:12,960
I will remember them

888
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:15,220
for the rest of my life.

889
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,750
I want to watch this show together with them.

890
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:20,020
This may be the grandest date

891
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,830
I've ever had

892
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:24,820
in my lifetime.

893
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:27,440
Also the grandest blind date and encounter.

894
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,210
I don't think I'll have

895
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:33,000
a more exciting encounter in my life

896
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,280
than I had in this program.

897
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:40,980
I've changed greatly here.

898
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:42,740
I'm very grateful for that.

899
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,620
And,

900
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:45,950
to be honest, this is not easy,

901
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:50,570
both physically and mentally.

902
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:52,430
I feel relaxed now that it's finished.

903
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:53,680
And I have some regrets.

904
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,330
(What kind of memory did the past week leave to you?)

905
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:56,420
It should be
(What kind of memory did the past week leave to you?)

906
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,690
It should be

907
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:04,310
a beautiful memory.

908
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,700
(Moist eyes)

909
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:20,420
I didn't want to come at first.

910
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:32,060
(Finally burst out in tears)

911
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:38,650
I didn't want to come at first.

912
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:39,980
(Hyeok-jun still felt troubled after he decided to attend the show.)

913
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:43,120
Now I don't know what I was thinking.
(Hyeok-jun still felt troubled after he decided to attend the show.)

914
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:47,130
I still felt a little burdened after I decided to attend the show.

915
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,450
And,

916
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:56,550
I was worried that people who know me would watch it.

917
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:58,590
So I felt a little uncomfortable.

918
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,260
When I first got here,

919
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:06,840
I didn't get along well with others.

920
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,360
So I kind of regretted it.

921
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,410
But after living together for a period,

922
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,320
I found that everyone is nice.

923
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:20,420
I don't know if I can still see them in the future.

924
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:23,920
But I'm grateful for meeting these nice guys.

925
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,010
I'm grateful and happy.

926
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:29,240
To be honest,

927
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:33,120
I don't know what will happen to my life,

928
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:33,620
but I'm not afraid anymore.

929
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,990
(But I'm not afraid anymore.)
but I'm not afraid anymore.

930
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:37,900
(But I'm not afraid anymore.)

931
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:42,120
I didn't have any gay friends before.

932
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,490
So I wasn't sure

933
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:48,670
that I like these brothers

934
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:52,500
because I never had this experience before

935
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:56,930
or because they were nice people.

936
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:02,210
This bothered me for a long time.

937
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:05,180
After talking with them,

938
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:09,270
I realized that they do these sweet things to their lover.

939
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:13,330
I'm happy that I learned a lot here.

940
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:20,210
I got to know myself better after I came here.

941
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:21,530
People like us

942
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:25,810
usually hide our nature.

943
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:30,000
So we often don't know

944
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,780
what our true self is like.

945
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:33,860
That's what I did.

946
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:35,820
What is my character?

947
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,580
(What on earth is my true self like?)
What is my character?

948
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,850
What is my real personality and state?
(What on earth is my true self like?)

949
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,550
I couldn't figure them out.
(What on earth is my true self like?)

950
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:45,310
But after I came here, I saw people of my kind.

951
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:49,470
We went through a lot together.

952
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:50,300
These experiences made me know myself better and find the true self.

953
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:55,650
(Find my true self.)
These experiences made me know myself better and find the true self.

954
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:56,260
(Find my true self.)

955
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,480
Of course, I also harvested love and friendship.

956
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,520
I gained a lot here.

957
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,670
(Letters to the men)

958
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:06,270
I don't think I can read this.
(Letters to the men)

959
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:09,940
(Letters to the men)

960
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,660
Thank you.

961
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,620
Oh, I got two.

962
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:20,890
(Um)

963
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:21,060
It turned out Chan-gyu also wrote me a letter.
(Um)

964
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,830
It turned out Chan-gyu also wrote me a letter.

965
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,520
Chan-gyu just put his number on it.

966
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:34,920
I wrote a short letter to Hyeok-jun.

967
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:37,300
I'm happy because of you.

968
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,410
This is a great experience.

969
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:43,540
(I'm happy because of you.)

970
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:46,610
This is my letter to Hyeok-jun.

971
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,130
I'll read it in front of you.

972
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:52,170
(I wrote this as they asked me to. Let's not keep in touch.)

973
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:55,440
I wrote this as they asked me to. Let's not keep in touch.

Thank you, but

975
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:58,500
you're not my type, boy.

(You're not my type.)
you're not my type, boy.

977
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:06,260
(Hee-hee)

978
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:11,130
His phone number is on it.

979
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,060
Heart shape. I really like you.

984
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:21,290
He is pretty cute sometimes.

00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:25,740

986

We suit each other.

992

He said I made his heart flutter.

993
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:43,340
I did those things out of sincerity.

994
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:47,290
I appreciate it that he got moved.

995
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:51,260
I wrote a letter to Seon-yul.
