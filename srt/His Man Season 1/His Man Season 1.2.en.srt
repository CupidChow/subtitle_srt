00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,560
(Understood)

You have an hour from now to match your date.

I'll draw one too.
(Quietly)

326
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,470

I'll still do it last this time.
(Eun-chan: I'll still do it last this time.)

329
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,740
Oh no.

330
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,210
Pick one for me. No, no.

331
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,460

00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:02,920
(The looks on their face are subtle after they drew the cards.)

338
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,890
(What cards did they draw?)

339
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,070
Should we show our cards first, then have breakfast?

Yeah?

342
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,330
Good idea.

343
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,060

((Me?))

345
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,270
(Awkward)

346
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,720
Why is it always me?
(Awkward)

347
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,450
Mine is...

348
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,090
(What kind of card did Eun-chan draw?)
Mine is...

349

Mine is...

354
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,080
To be honest, I was praying secretly

355
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,210
that Hyeok-jun didn't draw the arrow.

356

(Hyeok-jun drew a heart card.)

357
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:42,470
(Hyeok-jun drew a heart card.)

358
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,770

((Fortunately))

360
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,770
It's the heart card.

361
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,120
Mine is also the heart card.

364
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:58,150
Actually I wanted the arrow card more.

365
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,090
Because with the heart card, I'll have to wait for someone to choose me.

381
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,800
I wanted to have a date with Chang-min for at least once.

382
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,480
I wanted that.

383
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:25,930
I was hoping that we hadn't picked the same card.

384
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,050
That's a pity.

390
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,760
Now should we leave them some privacy?

391
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,090
Now we should have breakfast.

392
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,920

-A little bit.
-Just a little.

447
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,340
(A lot of salt)

448

(Panic)

449
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,830
Oh no.
(Panic)

450
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,890
Oh no.

451
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,210
((What happened?))

452
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,920
I forgot about it after I lit the fire.

453
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:20,400
(Will we be able to enjoy the breakfast?)

454
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,630
Brother, the eggs are getting burnt.

(He's way too busy.)

456

(He's finally finishing up.)

(Chan-gyu: What should we do with only five minutes to choose (our date)?)

Oh really.

00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:44,970
(Men look at each other and defer making a choice.)

461
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,450
How about putting one slice of bacon on the plate

462
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,680
of the one you want to date?

463
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,780
-Good idea!
-Right?

464
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,030
-Good idea!
-Right?

(Eun-chan: Good idea!)
-Good idea!
-Right?

466

(Good idea. Chang-min: Declare your affection with a slice of bacon.)

467
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,370
Declare your affection with a slice of bacon.
(Good idea. Chang-min: Declare your affection with a slice of bacon.)

468
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,780
Oh, that's good.

469
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:58,830
(It's a little embarrassing to say it out loud...)

470

(Eun-chan: Put bacon here for the one you want to ask out?)

472
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,099
Put bacon here for the one you want to ask out?
(Eun-chan: Put bacon here for the one you want to ask out?)

473
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:06,920
Privilege.

474
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,990
The cook today has the privilege to choose first.

475
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,810
Is that necessary?

476
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:13,869
(Plating the food carefully)
Is that necessary?

477

(Plating the food carefully)

-He's really serious.
-Look at how he does the plating.

Wait.

00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:26,930
((Shy) Running away quickly)
Wait.

What? Take your time.
((Shy) Running away quickly)

(Eun-chan: Should I just have the cheek to go for it when I apply?)
What? Take your time.

00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:29,720
(Eun-chan: Should I just have the cheek to go for it when I apply?)

492
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,560
Should I just have the cheek to go for it when I apply?
(Eun-chan: Should I just have the cheek to go for it when I apply?)

493
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,850
I'm so nervous.

494
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,050
(Everyone else is watching where Eun-chan is heading for.)

495
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,990
Who has the arrow card?

496
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,190
(Seon-yul, Chang-min, Eun-chan)
Who has the arrow card?

497
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,250
(Seon-yul, Chang-min, Eun-chan)

498

-The arrow card.
-Him.

(Seon-yul, Chang-min, Eun-chan)

500
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,870
I have it.
(Seon-yul, Chang-min, Eun-chan)

(Seon-yul, Chang-min, Eun-chan)

Him, him, you.

504
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,000
I feel so embarrassed doing this.

505
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,830
-We are even more nervous.
-Yeah, we are even more embarrassed.

506
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,190
(Who will Eun-chan give the food to?)

507
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,340
(Eun-chan chose Hyeok-jun.)

508
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,900
Thank you. Where did he go?

509
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,280
The rules didn't say you can't say no, right?

510
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,600
((Frustrated))

511
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:13,730
(Kidding. Just kidding. Ha-ha.)

512
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,170
Just kidding.
(Kidding. Just kidding. Ha-ha.)

513
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:15,850
Just kidding.

514
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,490
I was so happy.

515
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,040
I see.

516
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,020
I was really happy.

517
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,100
It must be delicious.

518
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,080
It should taste pretty good.

519
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,370
Please enjoy the food.

520
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,860
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you.

521
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,490
Arrow card holder, make your choice quickly.

522
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,540
(These two men have the arrow cards with which they can choose their date.)

523

(Seon-yul chose Chan-gyu decisively.)

(Kidding)

525
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,900
I wasn't the last guy to be chosen.

00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,320
When someone chose me,

527
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,860
I felt quite happy.

528

-Date me, then.
-I have to.

531
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,910
Because I hesitated,

532
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,460
it seemed as if I were made to date Jeong-hyeon.

533
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,080
I could date no one, but him.

534
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:18,660
I felt like he asked me out only because he had no other choice.

535
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,630
It didn't make me happy, actually.

We'll use small and exquisite accessories

to make a night light.

568
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,030
It's a night light?

569
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,430
Yes. There's a bulb in the candle.

570
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,100
It can be used as a lamp on the bedside table.

Great!

572
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,410
We have to sleep with the light on tonight.

Yeah, right in our dorms.

What colors will you use?

577
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,100
-I like discordant colors.
-Discordant?

578
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,230
Dissonant colors, I mean.

They're quite consonant. Something like this.

They look good.

583

It's good.

589

But you know,

590
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,750
it's nice if it's something where you have to move around.

591

(Eun-chan: Like things with activities?)
it's nice if it's something where you have to move around.

592
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:30,890
(Eun-chan: Like things with activities?)

593
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,170
-Like things with activities?
-Yes.
(Eun-chan: Like things with activities?)

594
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:32,200
(Hyeok-jun: This kind of things with activities are good. So are such quiet activities.)

595
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,070
This kind of things with activities are good. So are such quiet activities.
(Hyeok-jun: This kind of things with activities are good. So are such quiet activities.)

596
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,110
(Hyeok-jun: This kind of things with activities are good. So are such quiet activities.)

597
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,990
But I do want to climb the mountain.
(Hyeok-jun: This kind of things with activities are good. So are such quiet activities.)

598
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,540
But I do want to climb the mountain.

599
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:36,960
I've never climbed a mountain before.

600
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,300
(Eun-chan: I do want to climb a mountain.)
I've never climbed a mountain before.

601
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,840
Neither have I.

602
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:41,820
But I've always wanted to.

603
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:49,570
I want to climb the mountain on a Sunday morning.

604
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,570
-Sunday morning?
-Yes.

605
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,180
Shall we go climb the mountain?

606
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,740
Why not?

607
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,270
Shall we go climb the mountain?

608
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,200
Why not?

609
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,240
(Smiling, Hyeok-jun: We can carry a backpack...)

610
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,140
We can carry a backpack.
(Smiling, Hyeok-jun: We can carry a backpack...)

611
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,630
Yeah. We can carry one.

612
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:07,640
(So, they've already made a next date?)

613
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,300
Let me mix the colors.

614
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:09,850
(With a glance, Eun-chan: No offense, but last night, who did you call?)
Let me mix the colors.

615
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:09,870
(With a glance, Eun-chan: No offense, but last night, who did you call?)

616
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:14,780
No offense, but last night,
(With a glance, Eun-chan: No offense, but last night, who did you call?)

617
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:14,830
(With a glance, Eun-chan: No offense, but last night, who did you call?)

618
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,110
who did you call?
(With a glance, Eun-chan: No offense, but last night, who did you call?)

619
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,740
(In panic, Hyeok-jun: Who did I call?)

620
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,640
Who did I call?
(In panic, Hyeok-jun: Who did I call?)

621
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,030
(Hyeok-jun: Umm...)

622
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,400
To tell the truth,

623
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:25,570
(Nervous)
To tell the truth,

624
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,210
(Nervous)

625
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,410
I called Chang-min who was a couple with me.

626
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,660
Who did you call, then?

627
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,790
Did... Did you ask because you really don't know?

628
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,980
Yes, of course.

629
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:49,080
Last night, someone called me.

630
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,460
I've thought about if it was you.

631
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,450
It was me.

632
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,020
Really?

633
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,050
But last night, you...

634
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:01,540
I said hello, but the caller didn't say anything.

635
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,240
You said you could barely hear me.

636
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,730
I asked who you were.

637
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,390
But you hung up.

638
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,080
I didn't hang up. There was a time limit.

639
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,570
So we were disconnected automatically?
(Hyeok-jun: So we were disconnected...?)

640
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,190
So we were disconnected automatically?

641
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,670
I had planned to have a chat with you.

642
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,450
But just as I started to talk, the line was cut.

643
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,340
Then I held the receiver and I was like...

644
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,400
Because the line was cut.

645
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,220
You planned to say something?

646
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,840
Of course, I did.

647
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,840
(Got it.)
Of course, I did.

648
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:23,900
Last night, I was quite unlucky and suffered a lot.
(Got it.)
Of course, I did.

649
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:28,320
Last night, I was quite unlucky and suffered a lot.

650
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,030
I really didn't know that.

651
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:32,730
When I could decide whom to date today,

652
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,210
I thought fate was playing a joke on me.

653
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,380
Why? Why?

654
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,720
Did you wish to get the heart card?

655
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,030
I wished I could get the arrow card.

656
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,180
Really?

657
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,320
I prefer to make the choice.

658
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,200
But why...?

659
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,990
You got the arrow card.

660
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,700
Yeah.

661
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:50,770
Why didn't you make your choice immediately?

662
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,630
(Hyeok-jun: Why didn't you make your choice immediately?)
Why didn't you make your choice immediately?

663
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,250
(Twitch)

664
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,100
(Wriggle)

665
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,960
Do you mean choosing my date?

666
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,100
Yes.

667
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,190
(Curious. Hyeok-jun thinks Eun-chan didn't make a choice quickly because he wanted to date no one.)
Yes.

668
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,230
(Curious. Hyeok-jun thinks Eun-chan didn't make a choice quickly because he wanted to date no one.)

669
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:04,780
I thought if it was because you didn't want to choose anyone.
(Curious. Hyeok-jun thinks Eun-chan didn't make a choice quickly because he wanted to date no one.)

670
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,180
It's because I was too nervous.

671
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,320
Actually, last night,

672
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,180
I thought you knew I called you.

673
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,110
I really didn't know that.

674
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,770
I thought you did.

675
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,240
But you didn't call me.

676
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,670
I confessed my feelings, but you didn't.

677
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,940
That's what I thought.

678
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,990
I thought you rejected me.

679
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,850
Is that so?

680
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:32,670
(Eun-chan: Date application. I just decided to 'do it first and then regret', anyway.)

681
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,680
I just decided to 'do it first and then regret', anyway.
(Eun-chan: Date application. I just decided to 'do it first and then regret', anyway.)

682
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:34,900
I just decided to 'do it first and then regret', anyway.

683
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,650
(Nodding)
I just decided to 'do it first and then regret', anyway.

684
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,890
(Nodding)

685
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,870
-But I have a question.
-Go ahead.

686
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:44,410
If you got the arrow card,

687
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,410
who would you pick?

688
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,810
(Hyeok-jun: Umm... Me?)

689
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,050
Me?
(Hyeok-jun: Umm... Me?)

690
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:51,920
Me?

691
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:55,510
If I got the arrow card...

692
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,760
(Nervous)

693
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:57,820
Tell the truth, please.
(Nervous)

694
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,380
Tell the truth, please.

695
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:04,440
Honestly speaking, yesterday I...

696
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,260
(Q. Who do you want to date tomorrow?)

697
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:14,530
Tomorrow, I want to date Eun-chan who I didn't talk too much with.

698
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,440
Yesterday, I said I wanted to talk with you.

699
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:20,760
(Feeling happy, Eun-chan: Why?)

700
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,980
Why?
(Feeling happy, Eun-chan: Why?)

701
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,120
Because we didn't talk too much.

702
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,870
It was always three or four of us together.

703
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:27,980
(Eun-chan asks abruptly: Then why didn't you call me?)
It was always three or four of us together.

704
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,020
(Eun-chan asks abruptly: Then why didn't you call me?)

705
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,730
Then why didn't you call me?
(Eun-chan asks abruptly: Then why didn't you call me?)

706
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,090
If you wanted to talk, you should have called me.

707
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,450
We could have talked privately for 30 seconds last night.

708
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:36,990
That makes sense. I never thought of that.

709
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:42,120
Then I just called Chang-min who was a couple with me.

710
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,310
What a pity!

711
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:48,130
My bad.

712
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,490
(When they talk about what they care for,)

713
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:56,540
(they seem to get closer.)

714
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,000
What shall I put in the bottle?

715
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:00,980
Pick something for me.

716
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,240
How about this?

717
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,130
OK.

718
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:04,470
(Eun-chan picked a little dinosaur.)
OK.

719
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:04,510
(Eun-chan picked a little dinosaur.)

720
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,850
Sounds like you don't want it. You don't like it?
(Eun-chan picked a little dinosaur.)

721
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:07,680
Sounds like you don't want it. You don't like it?

722
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,680
I'll put this in it.

723
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,460
(Whiz)

724
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,600
What are you going to write?

725
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,660
(Shell)

726
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,090
What shall I write?
(Shell)

727
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:19,650
(Shell)

728
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:23,970
How about writing something to each other and exchanging the shells?

729
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,610
What do you think?

730
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,580
Good idea.

731
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:30,620
Let's write something simple. One or two sentences.

732
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,220
What shall I write?

733
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,190
(Wholeheartedly)

734
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:41,050
(Writing something to each other)

735
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,930
OK.

736
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,170
I'm done.

737
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,660
Let's exchange them.

738
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,510
I'm quite nervous.

739
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,940
(Pfft)

740
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,730
(Burst out laughing)

741
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,070
(Careful)

742
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,750
-Oh, that's how you put it.
-Then no one can see it, but me.

743
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,840
(Chatting nicely and making night lights carefully)

744
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,610
(What have they written to each other?)

745
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:17,600
(Hyeok-jun: Will you sleep with the light on tonight?)

746
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,200
Will you sleep with the light on tonight?
(Hyeok-jun: Will you sleep with the light on tonight?)

747
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,900
I will.

748
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,760
So will I.

749
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,600
(It's what Eun-chan wrote to Hyeok-jun.)

750
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,510
(It's what Hyeok-jun wrote to Eun-chan.)

751
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:37,740
(Nice to meet you! It's what Hyeok-jun wrote to Eun-chan.)

752
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,840
(Where Seon-yul and Chan-gyu are dating)

753
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,530
(Date in the bakery They're going to make popsicles.)

754
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:46,660
I chose to date Chan-gyu because I wanted to communicate with him.
(Date in the bakery They're going to make popsicles.)

755
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:54,170
I chose to date Chan-gyu because I wanted to communicate with him.

756
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,500
I didn't worry if he was my best choice.

757
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,730
Instead, I thought this date would be fun.

758
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,460
What are these?

759
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,570
Ice creams, right?

760
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,480
More likely chocolate.

761
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:10,720
(Chan-gyu: Yeah.)

762
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,540
Chocolate on an ice cream stick, right?
(Chan-gyu: Yeah.)

Chocolate on an ice cream stick, right?

765
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,850
This is the raw material.

00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:18,820
(Oh, I see.)
This is the raw material.

767
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:22,630
Which pattern would you like to make for me?

768
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,860
What suits me?

769

(Another peep)

772
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,970
This.

773
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,160
Don't you think it perfectly matches what you're wearing?

774
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:32,240
-Colors?
-Gray and white on your clothes.

775

Kind? That's all? Only kind?

779
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,870
Chocolate... It's also delicious, isn't it?

Because it looks cute. As cute as you.

792
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,520

806
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,360
Like this.

807
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,960
You've even got a puppy on you.

808
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,510
A puppy like that?

809

I'll try to make a similar one.

I felt so good because, oh my, he agreed to make it for me.

818
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:40,120
-So small.
-How cute!

819
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,200

Don't say that. It's a cute puppy.

(White chocolate)
-Let's get started.
-OK.

825
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,270
-We should first melt this.

May I?

830
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,260
Do you find it difficult to feed me?

I feel like I'm gifted.

840
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,420
-Are you doing fine?
-Yes.

841

-It hasn't solidified yet, right?
-I guess so.

855
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,880
I had planned to start with this one.

870
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,780
What do you think it is?

871
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,180
I'm making it attentively.

872
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,250
The shape looks a little bit weird. But I'm really looking forward to it.

873
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,300
Wow, so cute.

Where are its hands?

00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:51,370
-After it's baked, it will be sent to your place in 4 weeks.
-Alright, noted.
(Jeong-hyeon: After it's baked, it will be sent to your place in 4 weeks.)

1043
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:51,660
(Kidding, Jeong-hyeon: Just tell me your address.)
-After it's baked, it will be sent to your place in 4 weeks.
-Alright, noted.
(Jeong-hyeon: After it's baked, it will be sent to your place in 4 weeks.)

1044
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:51,690
(Kidding, Jeong-hyeon: Just tell me your address.)

1045
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,700
-Just tell me your address.
-Noted, thank you.
(Kidding, Jeong-hyeon: Just tell me your address.)

1046
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:52,900
-Just tell me your address.
-Noted, thank you.

1047
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,810
(Chang-min: Alright, thank you.)
-Just tell me your address.
-Noted, thank you.

1048
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,260
I want to know Jeong-hyeon better before.

1049
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,960
He seems completely different from me.

1050
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,600
He seems outgoing and high-pitched.

1051
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,480
Is this opposite attraction?

1052
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,140
May I draw on it?

1053
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,730
Yes, you could draw on it.

1054
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:27,790
Why can't I get it right?

1055
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,340
(Why can't I get it right...? Peek)
Why can't I get it right?

1056
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:29,830
(You have to use the knife)

1057
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,990
You have to use the knife, use the knife.
(You have to use the knife)

1058
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,150
You have to use the knife, use the knife.

1059
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:34,240
(Chang-min helped unconsciously)

1060
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,860
-With this?
-Yes.
(Chang-min helped unconsciously)

1061
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,840
(Chang-min helped unconsciously)

1062
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,080
What kind of soju cup are you making?

1063
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,750
What kind of shape?

1064
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,970
It should be just a regular one.

1065
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:47,060
But I will draw on it.

1066
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:47,780
Draw on it?

1067
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,090
I am drawing on it right now.

1068
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,620
What kind of drawing?

1069
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:51,730
An animal that looks like brother.

1070
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,110
(Jeong-hyeon: An animal that looks like brother Chang-min)
An animal that looks like brother.

1071
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,230
Really?

1072
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,910
Yes? What is it? On the beer mug?

1073
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,270
Yes, beer mug is tall, like you.

1074
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,250
It would be more like you.

1075
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,600
Really?

1076
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:08,350
When I first met you, I thought you look like golden retriever.

1077
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:12,810
So I'm making golden retriever right now.

1078
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:15,720
I heard people said I looked like a puppy.

1079
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,410
You looked exactly like one.

1080
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,050
(Glance)

1081
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,870
You look like a kitty.

1082
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,130
You look like a kitty.

1083
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:26,830
(Jeong-hyeon's expression is inexplicable)
You look like a kitty.

1084
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,350
(Jeong-hyeon's expression is inexplicable)

1085
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,840
I heard that brother likes youthful boys.

1086
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,950
I heard him like youthful boys with innocent and decent,

1087
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,530
handsome look.

1088
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,200
(Jeong-hyeon: (He said I looked like a cat so) I was upset.)
handsome look.

1089
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:37,320
(Jeong-hyeon: (He said I looked like a cat so) I was upset.)

1090
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,100
I am a little upset.
(Jeong-hyeon: (He said I looked like a cat so) I was upset.)

1091
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,420
So of all the people you have dated...

1092
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,420
Are they all your ideal type?

1093
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:49,930
Yes, except for one.

1094
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,480
Ideal type is just a saying.

1095
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:58,390
So I have reached this age without much dating experience.

1096
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,570
You don't have much dating experience?

1097
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,880
Yes, I have just a few.

1098
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,610
Do you have a lot of dating experience?

1099
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,630
I think I had have my fair share.

1100
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,710
I don't have much experience for my age.

1101
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,740
Really?

1102
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,020
Do you like experienced lover or?

1103
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,830
I like someone with experience.

1104
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,210
But not someone that's really good at it.

1105
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,750
-Really?
-Yes.

1106
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,170
Is it hard?

1107
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,230
-Can't look like an expert?
-Yes.

1108
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,440
It's hard.

1109
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,140
What are you doing.

1110
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,570
It's almost done.

1111
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,310
I'm looking at the mug you made.

1112
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,640
Really?

1113
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:36,550
Are you watching like TV?

1114
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,000
I'm appreciating it.

1115
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,300
("I am looking at your cup with admiration.")
I'm appreciating it.

1116
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:38,940
("I am looking at your cup with admiration.")

1117
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,000
Honestly I wasn't too interested in making things in the studio.
("I am looking at your cup with admiration.")

1118
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,100
Honestly I wasn't too interested in making things in the studio.

1119
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,480
(Chang-min: I wasn't too interested in making things in the studio.)
Honestly I wasn't too interested in making things in the studio.

1120
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,010
I just want to talk to him.

1121
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,540
He didn't really seem to be interested in the studio.

1122
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,680
And in me.

1123
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,050
I was really into it.

1124
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,290
But brother played while making it.

1125
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:58,290
(Jeong-hyeon: We picked cards in the morning, right?)

1126
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:01,130
-We picked cards this morning.
-Yes.
(Jeong-hyeon: We picked cards in the morning, right?)

1127
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:01,600
-We picked cards this morning.
-Yes.

1128
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:01,630
(Jeong-hyeon: Brother, do you want heart or?)

1129
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,880
Did you want heart or arrow?
(Jeong-hyeon: Brother, do you want heart or?)

1130
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:03,920
Did you want heart or arrow?

1131
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,710
(Jeong-hyeon: Arrow?)
Did you want heart or arrow?

1132
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,090
(Hum...)

1133
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,450
I didn't think too much, what about you?

1134
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,950
I don't want heart, I want arrow.

1135
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:13,070
(Chang-min: The one that you get to choose?)
I don't want heart, I want arrow.

1136
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:13,120
(Chang-min: The one that you get to choose?)

1137
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,790
-The one you get to choose.
-Yes.
(Chang-min: The one that you get to choose?)

1138
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,680
-The one you get to choose.
-Yes.

1139
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,610
Isn't it easier to be chosen?

1140
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,270
You don't have to do anything.

1141
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:24,280
But I was thinking who would choose me?

1142
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:29,830
I am more initiative anyway.

1143
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:29,910
(Ah...You are the more initiative type.)
I am more initiative anyway.

1144
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:29,960
(Ah...You are the more initiative type.)

1145
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,570
-More initiative.
-Yes.
(Ah...You are the more initiative type.)

1146
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:31,620
(Ah...You are the more initiative type.)

1147
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,080
I am more forward.
(Ah...You are the more initiative type.)

1148
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:32,230
I am more forward.

1149
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,080
(Jeong-hyeon: Yeah, I am very initiative.)
I am more forward.

1150
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,610
And I have a lot of ideas.

1151
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:41,720
So I am less proactive.

1152
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:45,880
-And shy.
-Are you shy?

1153
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,070
A little, a little.

1154
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,520
I don't know.

1155
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,820
So today...

1156
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,180
(Paused. Jeong-hyeon: What about today?)
So today...

1157
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:54,220
(Paused. Jeong-hyeon: What about today?)

1158
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,710
What about today?
(Paused. Jeong-hyeon: What about today?)

1159
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:59,520
I should have chosen when we were eating,

1160
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:04,650
But instead, it looked like I was left there.

1161
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,920
Like I was one of them.

1162
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,370
I guess I should choose first.

1163
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:12,240
Do you have someone in mind?

1164
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,050
I was thinking about it,

1165
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:17,110
and then someone got to him first before me.

1166
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,730
(OMG)
and then someone got to him first before me.

1167
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,900
Really?

1168
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,090
(Chang-min: Correction! I mean the order of the choice, it's not about who.)
Really?

1169
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:20,130
(Chang-min: Correction! I mean the order of the choice, it's not about who.)

1170
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:23,280
I mean the order of the choice, it's not about who
(Chang-min: Correction! I mean the order of the choice, it's not about who.)

1171
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:23,700
I mean the order of the choice, it's not about who

1172
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,520
((Brain stopped working))
I mean the order of the choice, it's not about who

1173
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,450
((Brain stopped working))

1174
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:26,170
(Jeong-hyeon: Misunderstood. Why…? It must be a pity…)

1175
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:28,520
How, it must be a pity.
(Jeong-hyeon: Misunderstood. Why…? It must be a pity…)

1176
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,230
How, it must be a pity.

1177
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:29,270
(Chang-min: True feeling. No, I am happy right now.)
How, it must be a pity.

1178
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:29,320
(Chang-min: True feeling. No, I am happy right now.)

1179
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,240
No, I am happy right now.
(Chang-min: True feeling. No, I am happy right now.)

1180
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:34,540
(Jeong-hyeon: Ah... I was thinking that...? What's going on? What's going on...)

1181
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,750
I was thinking, what's going on?
(Jeong-hyeon: Ah... I was thinking that...? What's going on? What's going on...)

1182
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:41,280
Was he saying that he didn't like me in front of me?

1183
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,430
(The air becomes awkward between misunderstanding and true feelings)

1184
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,940
Is that so?
(The air becomes awkward between misunderstanding and true feelings)

1185
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,510
Is that so?

1186
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,520
We had phone call yesterday.

1187
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:51,950
Is there someone you like among them?

1188
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,580
People who said they like you?

1189
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,540
But I could only guess one of them,

1190
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:00,800
(Chang-min: The people who called me yesterday.)
But I could only guess one of them,

1191
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,060
People who call me yesterday.

1192
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,270
I didn't know who the rest of them are.

1193
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,630
Really?

1194
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:05,700
(Of course, I was right there. But... it was pleasant)
Really?

1195
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:05,730
(Of course, I was right there. But... it was pleasant)

1196
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,160
But it was pleasant.
(Of course, I was right there. But... it was pleasant)

1197
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:07,200
(Of course, I was right there. But... it was pleasant)

1198
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,040
-Right, it must be, I was right there.
-Awkward.
(Of course, I was right there. But... it was pleasant)

1199
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:09,480
-It was a bit awkward.
-I was so embarrassed.

1200
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,040
(Jeong-hyeon: I was so embarrassed. Why? Did I mute my phone?)
-It was a bit awkward.
-I was so embarrassed.

1201
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,090
(Jeong-hyeon: I was so embarrassed. Why? Did I mute my phone?)

1202
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:13,650
Why? Did I mute my phone?
(Jeong-hyeon: I was so embarrassed. Why? Did I mute my phone?)

1203
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:14,130
Why? Did I mute my phone?

1204
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:16,590
I felt so awkward.

1205
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,540
You called yesterday.

1206
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,630
I did.

1207
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,910
Can you tell me why you would call that guy?

1208
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:28,640
Honestly, I was thinking it was more like I want to know you

1209
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,770
instead of I like you.

1210
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:36,870
I simply called the person with the looks I like the most.

1211
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:40,150
But he was the person you like the most, right?

1212
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:40,270
(Not really)
But he was the person you like the most, right?

1213
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:40,310
(Not really)

1214
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,090
-Not really.
-Oh?
(Not really)

1215
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,180
I am curious.

1216
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,290
When I met him for the first time yesterday,

1217
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,770
I thought he was just a kid who didn't know any better.

1218
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,670
But now I feel like he wasn't someone frivolous.

1219
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:59,500
I like him a little more than yesterday.

1220
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,360
(The date of attraction and staggering back and forth is over)

1221
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,440
(The Men's House Seon-yul: Let's put them in the fridge.)

1222
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,370
Let's put it to the fridge.
(The Men's House Seon-yul: Let's put them in the fridge.)

1223
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:06,540
(The guys' house Chan-gyu's fridge?)
Let's put it to the fridge.
(The Men's House Seon-yul: Let's put them in the fridge.)

1224
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:06,580
(The guys' house Chan-gyu's fridge?)

1225
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,970
-To the fridge?
-Yes.
(The guys' house Chan-gyu's fridge?)

1226
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,270
It would be better in the freezer.

1227
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,700
-In the freezer?
-Yes.

1228
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,540
Then in the freezer.

1229
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,670
Give them a surprise later.

1230
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:17,770
I will put it in here.

1231
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,660
They must wonder what it is.

1232
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,020
What it is?

1233
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,160
(Second to arrive are Hyeok-jun and Eun-chan)
What it is?

1234
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,500
(Second to arrive are Hyeok-jun and Eun-chan)

1235
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,640
What did they do?

1236
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:30,620
But I'm sure ours are the cutest, right?

1237
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:34,390
(The two are waiting for the rest of them)

1238
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,230
(Suddenly)

1239
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:39,300
Did you feel my sincerity during the date?

1240
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,970
No.

1241
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:44,520
What are you talking about?

1242
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:45,610
(-Chan-gyu: Why didn't you accept my feelings?
-Seon-yul: We will see.)

1243
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,640
Why didn't you accept my feelings?
(-Chan-gyu: Why didn't you accept my feelings?
-Seon-yul: We will see.)

1244
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:47,670
(-Chan-gyu: Why didn't you accept my feelings?
-Seon-yul: We will see.)

1245
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,320
I know. We will see.
(-Chan-gyu: Why didn't you accept my feelings?
-Seon-yul: We will see.)

1246
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:51,760
I should join this, I should join this.

1247
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:51,800
(Seon-yul dated Eun-chan on the first day and then Chan-gyu the next day)

1248
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,590
-You have also went on a date with him, right?
-Yes.
(Seon-yul dated Eun-chan on the first day and then Chan-gyu the next day)

1249
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,020
Who do you like more?

1250
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:57,090
(Flash^)

1251
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,310
(Chan-gyu's sudden provocation (?))

1252
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:00,120
I'm so tired of this.

1253
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,090
(Acting innocent)
I'm so tired of this.

1254
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:01,420
-It's true.
-You are discussing some interesting topics here.

1255

You can tell the truth, I really don't mind it.

1274
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,080
So tired!

1275
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,000
Come on! Say it.

1276
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,410
To be honest, it's the first date with you.

1277
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,120
So I felt kind of hurry-scurry, I can not feel anything else.

(Seon-yul: Kind of hurry-scurry, I can not feel a certain (feeling).)

So what you did was for yourself?

1348
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:38,890
No, I made for all of us.
