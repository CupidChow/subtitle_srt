(What happened to Jeong-ho?)

154
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,540
(Chan-gyu went upstairs after he got up.)

155
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,830
What smells so good?

156
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,380
What's this?

157
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,250
Looks great, right?

158
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,740
(He even prepared dessert.)

159
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,940
Hey, why didn't you wake me up this morning?

160
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,270
I said I would help you.

161
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,440
Oh, really? I thought you were awake.

162
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,690
You kept tossing and turning.

163
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,159
I move a lot in sleep.

164
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,170
I don't need a lot of help here.

165
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,500
(Chan-gyu feels guilty for not helping with breakfast.)

166
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,110
(Half-awake)

167
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,710
You can start.
(Half-awake)

168
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,260
(Half-awake)

169
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:57,790
Let's eat together.

170
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,770
I have an upset stomach.

171
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,890
So no breakfast?

172
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,690
I'll have a cup of coffee.

173
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,900
(Jeong-ho prepared breakfast for all the others but not himself.)

174
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,940
I'll start eating then.

175
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,520
Okay.

176
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,630
What is this?

177
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,170
Phat Thai.

178
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,360
I see.

179
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,920
Jeong-ho, when did you get up?

180
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:19,870
Me?

181
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,390
Um.

182
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,370
I wasn't able to sleep cause I had stomachache.

183
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,460
(It turns out he's feeling unwell.)

184
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,920
Didn't you hear me getting in and out?
(It turns out he's feeling unwell.)

185
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,540
(It turns out he's feeling unwell.)

186
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,020
Many times.

187
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,030
I didn't want to wake you so I walked softly.

188
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,290
I slept like a log last night.

189
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,310
Oh, really?

190
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:39,140
Chan-gyu is kind.

191
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,270
I know that he has been trying to help me.

192
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,390
Very warm-hearted.

193
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,880
Jeong-ho takes care of me.

194
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,700
He cares about my feelings.

195
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,000
We often chat together.

196
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,110
So gradually Jeong-ho grows on me.

197
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,060
(Jeong-ho stood up from the seat soon.)

198
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,580
(Glance)

199
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,680
-You finished?
-I'll go downstairs first.

200
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,980
Yeah, I'll go downstairs first.

201
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,950
Enjoy the food.

202
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,110
Okay, I'll feast on them.

203
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,220
Good.

204
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:12,810
(Worried)
Good.

205
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,780
(Worried)

206
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,580
(Does he feel terrible?)

207
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,540
(Though with a stomachache, Jeong-ho still prepared breakfast.)

208
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,300
(Back to bed quietly trying to get some sleep)

209
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,020
(Others came to have breakfast later.)

210
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,180
You already started?

211
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,260
I started a while ago.

212
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,100
Where is Jeong-ho?

213
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,659
Jeong-ho said he had an upset stomach and couldn't eat.

214
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:38,870
Did he go downstairs?

215
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:39,409
What?

216
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:40,020
Did he get back to his room?

217
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,919
Yeah, back to our room.

218
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,220
He left after he finished cooking?

219
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,260
But it's true that cooking makes people lose their appetite.

220
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,890
I'll start eating.

221
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,250
Please enjoy the food. I didn't make it, though.

222
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,630
You wouldn't have got up if I didn’t wake you up, right?

223
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,660
Yeah.

224
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,140
(Yeah. LOL)
Yeah.

225
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,900
(Yeah. LOL)

226
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,180
If no one wakes me up,

227
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,840
I will probably get up at 1 or 2 pm.

228
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,380
Or 12 am at noon.

229
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,970
So do you need someone to wake you up in the morning?

230
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,290
It would be nice if someone could do so.

231
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,610
Are you suggesting that you want me to do it?

232
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:10,760
(I got it.)

233
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,640
I got it.
(I got it.)

234
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,460
(I got it.)

235
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,260
(Hee hee)

236
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,180
Hello.

237
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,940
(Hello.)
Hello.

238
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,020
-Good morning.
-Morning.
(Hello.)
Hello.

239
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,420
(Good morning.)
-Good morning.
-Morning.

240
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,110
(Roommates Hyeok-jun and Chang-min showed up together.)

241
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,130
Who made breakfast?
(Roommates Hyeok-jun and Chang-min showed up together.)

242
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,260
Jeong-ho.
(Roommates Hyeok-jun and Chang-min showed up together.)

243
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,620
Jeong-ho left after he finished cooking. Phat Thai.

244
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:23,640
(Phat Thai?)
Jeong-ho left after he finished cooking. Phat Thai.

245
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,100
Phat Thai?
(Phat Thai?)

246
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,940
(Phat Thai?)

247
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,070
It looks tasty.

248
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,610
Are you happy that you got my roommate?

249
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,220
Are you happy that you got my roommate?

250
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,930
Very happy.

251
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:36,580
Very happy.

252
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,270
(A prick of conscience)
Very happy.

253
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,900
(A prick of conscience)

254
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,460
It's a nice room.

255
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,640
(It's a nice room.)
It's a nice room.

256
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:40,740
Why couldn't you sleep in a room that nice?
(It's a nice room.)
It's a nice room.

257
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,500
Why couldn't you sleep in a room that nice?

258
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:43,380
I slept better there than I did in this one.

259
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,720
(I slept better there than I did in this one.)
I slept better there than I did in this one.

260
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,080
(I slept better there than I did in this one.)

261
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,490
Did you?
(I slept better there than I did in this one.)

262
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:45,880
Yes.
(I slept better there than I did in this one.)

263
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,900
(I slept better there than I did in this one.)

264
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,100
It's a pity.

265
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,600
But on the other hand, it's for the best.

266
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,000
Because after all,

267
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,900
Hyeok-jun and I spent too much time together.

268
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,270
That makes it hard for us to fall for each other.

269
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,500
(After the room change, Seon-yul's feeling for Hyeok-jun is different.)

270
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,890
I'll go get ready.

271
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:20,300
(Hyeok-jun and Chang-min are still eating and Seon-yul has left.)

272
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,170
Who made breakfast this morning?

273
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,060
Jeong-ho.

274
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,460
Wow, amazing.

275
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,110
Tasty.

276
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,420
It looks great.

277
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,370
I’ll get some too.

278
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,020
(Hyeon–the last one to go to the kitchen)

279
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:33,860
Good morning.

280
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,390
(Good morning.)
Good morning.

281
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,140
(Good morning.)

282
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:36,460
Morning.

283
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,390
(Morning.)
Morning.

284
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,260
(Morning.)

285
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:38,700
Who made this?

286
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,860
(Who made this?)
Who made this?

287
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:39,970
(Jeong-ho.)

288
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:40,840
-Jeong-ho.
-Jeong-ho.
(Jeong-ho.)

289
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,420
(Jeong-ho.)

290
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,790
This is... um...

291
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:44,740
Song

292
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,300
(Song)
Song

293
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,420
Tar

00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:46,340
(Tar)

296
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:46,900
Phat Thai.

297
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,240
(Phat Thai.)
Phat Thai.

298
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,300
Yeah, Phat Thai.
(Phat Thai.)

299
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,340
(Yeah, Phat Thai.)
Yeah, Phat Thai.
(Phat Thai.)

300
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:52,890
I'm full.

301
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,580
(What is he looking at?)

302
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,120
The flowers have come to life. It's magic!

303
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:02,360
(Wow.)

304
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,530
-Wow!
-Flowers...
(Wow.)

305
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,520
Where’d you get these flowers?

306
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,960
Aren't these the flowers you threw away?

307
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,120
From Jeong-ho.

308
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,380
Yeah, you threw them away but now they're here.

309
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,660
Jeong-ho said he picked them up from the ground and placed them here.

310
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,210
(Quad room, last night)

311
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:15,660
When I gave him the bouquet,
(Quad room, last night)

312
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,740
When I gave him the bouquet,

313
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,630
he said he would put the flowers in a vase prettily.

314
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,040
They've withered.

315
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,400
(Observing for no reason)

316
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,780
He even asked if they could live longer in a vase.
(Observing for no reason)

317
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,010
He even asked if they could live longer in a vase.

318
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,420
The bouquet was thrown on the floor

319
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,020
with the crumpled towel.

320
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,320
I was mad at that time.

321
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,260
So mad

322
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,680
that I put the flowers in ice water

323
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,930
and then put the glass on the table.

324
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,780
Eun-chan was also in the living room then.

325
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,180
He watched the whole thing but said nothing.

326
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,940
(Oh, help)

327
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,520
I want to explain it.

328
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,970
I didn't throw away the bouquet.

329
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,120
I just took it out of my bag temporarily.

330
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,900
I put it aside

331
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,940
to organize my things.

332
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,190
It's temporary. Just for that short period.

333
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,390
I had no intention to throw it away.

334
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,140
(A little misunderstanding)

335
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,270
Jeong-ho is meticulous.

336
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,710
And thoughtful.

337
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,140
The flowers have come alive.

338
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:21,900
So careful.

339
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,440
I never thought of putting them in the glass here.

340
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,320
(With a guilty feeling, Eun-chan keeps stroking the flowers.)

341
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,300
That's funny.
(With a guilty feeling, Eun-chan keeps stroking the flowers.)

342
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,660
(With a guilty feeling, Eun-chan keeps stroking the flowers.)

343
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,380
(Eun-chan finished breakfast and went back to the room.)

344
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:39,260
(Unlike his last room, this quad room is quiet.)

345
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,860
The other three people are quiet.

346
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,870
So I feel I also should act like them.

347
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,020
After a period of time, things

348
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:53,970
get a little

349
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,300
(Awkward...)

350
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,610
awkward.
(Awkward...)

351
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,540
(The three of them are extremely quiet today.)

352
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,000
Before we changed rooms,

353
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:11,070
I could hear noises and laughter from the first floor.

354
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,180
Who is Gyu-chan?

355
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:13,690
(The old roommates of the quad room got along well.)
Who is Gyu-chan?

356
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:13,960
(The old roommates of the quad room got along well.)

357
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,850
I'm curious who Gyu-chan is.
(The old roommates of the quad room got along well.)

358
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:16,660
My friend.
(The old roommates of the quad room got along well.)

359
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,760
Oh, really? Geez.
(The old roommates of the quad room got along well.)

360
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,240
After we changed rooms, the first floor became quiet.

361
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,390
That's how I feel.

362
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,340
Just lower the corner of my eye a little.

363
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,260
(Unlike the quiet first floor, Jeong-hyeon's single room is lively.)
Just lower the corner of my eye a little.

364
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:28,570
(Unlike the quiet first floor, Jeong-hyeon's single room is lively.)

365
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,350
Lower?
(Unlike the quiet first floor, Jeong-hyeon's single room is lively.)

366
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,690
Yeah.
(Unlike the quiet first floor, Jeong-hyeon's single room is lively.)

367
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,440
The outer corner?

368
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:30,700
Yeah.

369
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:30,830
(Hyeok-jun is asking Jeong-hyeon to help with his makeup.)
Yeah.

370
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,970
(Hyeok-jun is asking Jeong-hyeon to help with his makeup.)

371
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,040
Now I look too serious.
(Hyeok-jun is asking Jeong-hyeon to help with his makeup.)

372
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,550
(Hyeok-jun is asking Jeong-hyeon to help with his makeup.)

373
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,410
No, you don't.
(Hyeok-jun is asking Jeong-hyeon to help with his makeup.)

374
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,310
Did you come to do some makeup?

375
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,840
Yeah.

376
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,640
You look like the manager of a beauty salon.

377
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,180
-Yeah, with a jacket.
-You dress like

378
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,710
a manager.

379
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,980
Manager, are you busy today?

380
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,300
I have another customer in 30 minutes after I finish your makeup.

No, relax your eyes and look down.

What? What's going on?

Someone touched my bottom.

407

I can't stay here.

Hold on. Everyone, please go out for a second.

447
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,180
It gives me that kind of feeling.

448

(A little nervous)

450
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,380
So full makeup?

451
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,340
Full makeup.

452

(Unknowingly, Chang-min and Jeong-hyeon are alone together.)

Your mouth is really big.

457
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,480
Because it's chapped.

458
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,400
Why is it chapped?

459
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,830
When I get tired, my lips chap first.

460

Because we were close and face to face,

461

You can't replace it if you touch it.

744
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:23,620
You touched it. You touched it.

You touched it. You touched it.

Oh? Oh?
(Breathtaking)

748
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:27,980
(Breathtaking)

749
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,010
There's a question.

750
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:29,350
What's it?

751
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,060
Oh my.

752
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,340
If you run into someone you like in the public baths...

753
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,900
(Q: If you run into someone you like in the public bath...)

755
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:33,860
In the public baths?

756
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,600
(In the public baths?)
In the public baths?

757
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,460
(In the public baths?)

758
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:35,910
Brush teeth.
(In the public baths?)

759
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:36,100
Brush teeth first.

760
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,190
(Brush teeth first.)
Brush teeth first.

761
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,700
(Brush teeth first.)

762
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,100
Why would you brush your teeth suddenly?

763
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,940
(Why would you brush your teeth suddenly?)
Why would you brush your teeth suddenly?

764
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,100
If I run into someone I like in the public baths...

765
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:43,740
Hello.

766
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,330
(Grand air)
Hello.

767
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,910
(Grand air)

768
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:46,750
Hello.
(Grand air)

769
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,500
You seem to be very confident.

770
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:48,740
No. No.

771
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,160
(Joking)
No. No.

772
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,750
It's just a joke.
(Joking)

773
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,260
It's a joke.

774
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,760
What should I do? Should I show him my butt?

775
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,900
What to do?

776
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,530
When you run into someone you have a secret crush on in the public baths,

777
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,190
Take a glance.

778
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,120
Picture the scene.

779
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,410
Take a quick look

780
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:01,980
and talk to him.

781
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,060
(Say hello cheerfully)
and talk to him.

782
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,110
Oh, nice to see you here.
(Say hello cheerfully)

783
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:04,580
-It's really weird.
-But...

00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,070
(It's really weird.)
-It's really weird.
-But...

785
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:05,800
In complete nudity?
(It's really weird.)

786
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,300
What if they ask, "Where are you looking at while talking to me?"
(It's really weird.)

787
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,720
What if they ask, "Where are you looking at while talking to me?"

788
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,220
(Dizzy)

789
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:11,300
In the public baths. It's a weird question itself.
(Dizzy)

790
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,740
In the public baths. It's a weird question itself.

791
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,410
I'll just go out for I'm embarrassed.

792
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,950
As I run out, I'll steal a glance like this.

793
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,980
Don't go out before you see what you should have seen.

794
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,460
Yeah, see what you should have seen first.

795
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:23,500
(Like this)
Yeah, see what you should have seen first.

796

799
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,380
When you come out like this...

800
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:26,810
(Peeking)
When you come out like this...

801

802
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,510
(Funny)

803
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,620
I don't think I dare to peek.
(Funny)

804
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,320
I don't think I dare to peek.

805
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:31,460
-Yeah, right.
-It's a little...

806
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,220
(Yeah, right)
-Yeah, right.
-It's a little...

807
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:32,380
Because you're shy?
(Yeah, right)

Yeah.
(Because you're shy?)

810
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,080
If he is someone I really like,

811
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,230
I shouldn’t dare look at him from the face down.

812
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,550
From the face down? Liar.

813
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,150
-Oh, I mean it.
-Really?

814
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,020
I really don't dare look at him.

(I really don't dare look at him.)

820
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,190
I’ll be shy.

821
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,620

826
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,040
It’s always possible to become lovers

827
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,270
if it’s someone you fancy.

828
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,740
Some straight people do that too.

829

(I can’t.)
Some straight people do that too.

830

I can’t.
(I can’t.)

831
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,680
Absolutely no.

832
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:01,900
Straight people can. Why can’t you?

833
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,360
(Friends to lovers possible VS impossible)
Straight people can. Why can’t you?

I see him as a friend for three years.

837
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,740
And he says let’s find a place to rest after we get drunk.

838
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,320
It will really annoy me if he says that.

839
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:13,550
(Nod)

840
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,980

And I don’t want any physical contact at all.

842
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,920
I can’t be friends with someone I like.

843
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,100
From the start?

844
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,640
(From the start?)
From the start?

845
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,170

In that case,

849
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:23,460
I would probably confess.

What about Jeong-hyeon?
(I like kissing.)

894
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,170
(What about Jeong-hyeon?)
What about Jeong-hyeon?

895
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:11,380
(What about Jeong-hyeon?)

896
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:11,780
Me?
(What about Jeong-hyeon?)

897
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,570
My favorite physical contact is sniffing.

898
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,260
Not the dirty kind.

899
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,860
(Don’t misunderstand!)
Not the dirty kind.

900
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:18,900
I know what you meant.
(Don’t misunderstand!)
Not the dirty kind.

901
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:18,980
I know what you meant.

902
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,380
(I know what you meant.)
I know what you meant.

903
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,320
Wait.

904
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,220
Wait.

905
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:23,640
(Wait)
Wait.

906
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,420
(Wait)

907
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,620
(Accept my smell.)

908
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,230
That’s not what I meant.

909
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,550
Like when we are hugging.

910
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,740
I like sniffing his neck.

911
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,550
Body scent?

912
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,920
Yeah, I like smelling that.

913
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,680
My favorite is kissing his cheeks. I kiss him.

914
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,550
Not being kissed. But me kissing his cheeks.

915
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,990
I like kissing his lips. Not actual kissing though.

916
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,870
I really would be at him all day asking for it.

917
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,440
For kiss?

918
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:43,900
Yeah.

919
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:44,540
What about Chan-gyu?

920
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:44,960
(What about Chan-gyu?)
What about Chan-gyu?

921
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,430
(What about Chan-gyu?)

922
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:45,940
I like hugging.
(What about Chan-gyu?)

923
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,670
I like hugging.

924
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,040
Because I like hearing his heartbeat.

925
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,790
Right. You said it before.

926
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,100
Hugging.

927
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:50,480
(I see.)
Hugging.

928
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,610
Heartbeats.
(I see.)

929
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:53,620
When did you first realize you are gay?

930
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,610
(Q. When did you first realize you are gay?)
When did you first realize you are gay?

931
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,500
(Q. When did you first realize you are gay?)

932
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,720
I lived in New Zealand when I was in elementary school.

933
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,890
A foreigner that looked like a model passed me by.

934
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,220
He was very tall, very handsome.

935
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,270
When I saw him,

936
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:07,580
my heart was pounding so fast.

937
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,800
(The moment of crush was engraved in his memory.)
my heart was pounding so fast.

938
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,720
I was thinking, what’s happening?
(The moment of crush was engraved in his memory.)

939
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,050
(The moment of crush was engraved in his memory.)

940
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,340
I looked up and saw his jawline.
(The moment of crush was engraved in his memory.)

941
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,750
I looked up and saw his jawline.

942
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,490
I still remember that moment.

943
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,120
To this day.

944
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,350
I started to realize it at thirteen after I went to America.

945
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,560
I did at the age of twenty-one. I even had a girlfriend back then.

946
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,510
(Ho)

947
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,500
When I was with my girlfriend,
(Ho)

948
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,400
When I was with my girlfriend,

949
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:38,460
I didn’t feel nearly as good as when I was with a guy.

950
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,240
So I thought, oh, is this right?

951
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,050
Ah, I’m gay. Maybe I like guys.

952
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,830
After I had that thought,

953
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,150
I was drinking and crying for a week.

954
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,140
(The first moment of confusion after realizing his sexual orientation.)

955
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:58,180
When was your first love? To whom?

956
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,140
(Q. When was your first love? To whom?)
When was your first love? To whom?

957
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,080
I remember it very clearly.

958
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:01,980
I was in eighth grade.

959
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,550
(Eun-chan’s first love in eighth grade)
I was in eighth grade.

960
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,110
(Eun-chan’s first love in eighth grade)

961
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:04,300
And I was in a boy’s school.
(Eun-chan’s first love in eighth grade)

962
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,240
And I was in a boy’s school.

963
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:09,270
I saw a handsome guy with fair skin

964
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,190
in the corridor at school.

965
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:18,160
I had a secret crush on him until I graduated.

966
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,830
I still remember his name.

967
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,480
What is it?

968
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,020
Of course I can’t tell.

969
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,620
(Playing dumb)
(I can’t tell.)
Of course I can’t tell.

970
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,350
(Hahaha)

971
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,260
I had my first love in high school.
(Hahaha)

972
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,980
I had my first love in high school.

973
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,370
But,

974
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,670
I met someone when I was twenty.

975
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,850
And I thought, this is my true first love.

976
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,730
This is true love.

977
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,960
Then I had my next boyfriend when I was twenty-four.

978
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,690
So this is true love. This is my first love.

979
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,210
So it’s first love with everyone you met.

980
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:44,260
-Always updating.
-It’s always your first love.

981
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,760
(It’s always your first love.)
(It’s always first love with someone new.)

982
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,410
(It’s always first love with someone new.)
-Always updating.
-It’s always your first love.

983
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:44,260
(It’s always first love with someone new.)

984
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:46,820
Seriously though.
(It’s always your first love.)
(It’s always first love with someone new.)

985
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,280
Seriously though.

986
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,630
It’s very romantic from another perspective.

987
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,870
You treat everyone like it’s your first love.

988
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:51,560
So,

989
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,840
every time you get into a relationship,

990
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,880
you would give everything you have, with no regrets.

991
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,070
(Shy)

992
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:57,850
First love.
(Shy)

993
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:58,190
(When was Hyeok-jun’s first love?)

994
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,310
When was Hyeok-jun’s first love?
(When was Hyeok-jun’s first love?)

995
00:29:59,310 --> 00:29:59,640
(When was Hyeok-jun’s first love?)

996
00:29:59,640 --> 00:29:59,860
When I was twenty.
(When was Hyeok-jun’s first love?)

997
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,340
When I was twenty.

998
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,350
(Hyeok-jun met his twenty-four-year-old first love at the age of twenty.)
When I was twenty.

999
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:01,920
(Hyeok-jun met his twenty-four-year-old first love at the age of twenty.)

1000
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,020
He was twenty-four.
(Hyeok-jun met his twenty-four-year-old first love at the age of twenty.)

1001
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,300
(Hyeok-jun met his twenty-four-year-old first love at the age of twenty.)

1002
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:04,580
I liked him so much.
(Hyeok-jun met his twenty-four-year-old first love at the age of twenty.)

1003
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,850
I liked him so much.

1004
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,830
I missed him very much when he was having classes.

1005
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,830
But… How do I put it?

1006
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,890
I took a bus there in the morning and waited till his class was over.

1007
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:17,950
Then I suddenly showed up in front of him.

1008
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,670
That feels really cute.

1009
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:27,490
How would you feel

1010
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,880
if you run into your first love now?

1011
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,490
Oh.

1012
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:32,250
I won’t feel the same as before.

1013
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,830
What was your type back then?

1014
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:38,120
As long as he liked me.

1015
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:38,580
I mean

1016
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,070
(Very innocent)
I mean

1017
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,780
if he was a good person and he liked me, I would open my heart to him as well.
(Very innocent)

1018
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,440
if he was a good person and he liked me, I would open my heart to him as well.

1019
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,090
I didn’t have many standards back then.

1020
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,090
So now you do.

1021
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:46,340
Now I have loads of standards.

1022
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,620
(Now I have loads of standards.)
Now I have loads of standards.

1023
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,040
(Now I have loads of standards.)

1024
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,140
You became picky.
(Now I have loads of standards.)

1025
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,560
You became picky.

1026
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,140
-I guess so.
-But,

1027
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,480
(Nod)
-I guess so.
-But,

1028
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:51,580
I think I’m like that too.
(Nod)
-I guess so.
-But,

1029
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,940
I think I’m like that too.

1030
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,700
It’s not under my control.

1031
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:54,820
I’m always the same.

1032
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,050
(I’m always the same.)
I’m always the same.

1033
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:56,600
Ah, really?
(I’m always the same.)

1034
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,570
Ah, but,
(I’m always the same.)

1035
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:00,860
if I’ve dated some great people,

1036
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,320
it’s wrong to compare your date to your exes,

1037
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,600
but I can’t help the thought

1038
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:10,140
-of meeting someone better than my exes.
-You want someone better.

1039
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,490
Yeah.

1040
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:10,940
I gradually started to have that kind of thought.

1041
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:17,790
(The men are always hoping to have a better relationship.)
I gradually started to have that kind of thought.

1042
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,390
(The men are always hoping to have a better relationship.)

1043
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:19,420
But I would still date him if I like him a lot.
(The men are always hoping to have a better relationship.)

1044
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:19,740
But I would still date him if I like him a lot.

1045
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,050
(Nod)
But I would still date him if I like him a lot.

1046
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:21,600
That’s true.
(Nod)

1047
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,140
(Nod)

1048
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:27,060
(Complicated)

1049
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,780
(Q. Do you want to get married?)

1050
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:28,820
(I do. I have to get married.)
(Q. Do you want to get married?)

1051
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,960
I do. I have to get married.
(I do. I have to get married.)
(Q. Do you want to get married?)

1052
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,100
With whom?

1053
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:31,880
A guy?

1054
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,880
With my future boyfriend.

1055
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,690
Not a girl?

1056
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,070
I want to have two weddings.

1057
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:36,340
Why?

1058
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:36,880
(Why?)
Why?

1059
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,380
(Why?)

1060
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,670
One regular wedding,

1061
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,340
and one drag artist wedding.

1062
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:40,360
(Cool)
and one drag artist wedding.

1063
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,840
Cool.
(Cool)

1064
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,700
I want two different sets of pictures.

1065
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:43,730
(Sounds awesome.)
I want two different sets of pictures.

1066
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,390
Sounds awesome.
(Sounds awesome.)

1067
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:45,870
(It’s Hyeon’s turn to draw a block.)

1068
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,720
It’s your turn.
(It’s Hyeon’s turn to draw a block.)

1069
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,350
(Shaky)

1070
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:50,660
Shut up, please.
(Shaky)

1071
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:50,940
Shut up, please.

1072
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,530
(Shut up, please.)
Shut up, please.

1073
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,580
(Shut up, please.)

1074
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,800
You succeeded.

1075
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,880
Cute.

1076
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:58,900
What’s the most unforgettable thing you’ve heard as a gay?

1077
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,710
(Q. What’s the most unforgettable thing you’ve heard as a gay?)
What’s the most unforgettable thing you’ve heard as a gay?

1078
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,820
(Q. What’s the most unforgettable thing you’ve heard as a gay?)

1079
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,680
Is there any?

1080
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,200
Of course.

1081
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,750
What is it?

1082
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:06,980
Insult.

1083
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,640
(Insult)
Insult.

1084
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,340
(Insult)

1085
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:08,760
(Stunned)

1086
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,530
My god.
(Stunned)

1087
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:09,900
(Stunned)

1088
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,420
I know they are not very educated people.
(Stunned)

1089
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,740
I know they are not very educated people.

1090
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,350
(Sharing his memories calmly)
I know they are not very educated people.

1091
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:13,870
(Sharing his memories calmly)

1092
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,510
But I didn’t just let it go.
(Sharing his memories calmly)

1093
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,820
Who said it?

1094
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,200
Thankfully when I came out,

1095
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,240
expect my parents, nobody insulted me.

1096
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,980
Through private messages online.

1097
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,220
(Ho)

1098
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:31,700
Some evil people.

1099
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,980
(Some evil people.)
Some evil people.

1100
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,380
(Some evil people.)

1101
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:33,540
I didn’t come out. So there isn’t any unforgettable insult.
(Some evil people.)

1102
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,690
I didn’t come out. So there isn’t any unforgettable insult.

1103
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,810
Oh, I’ve heard something like that.

1104
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,380
I might have deleted the insult from my memory.

1105
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,640
They said I was possessed by the devil.

1106
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,640
(Shocked)

1107
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,780
Just all kinds of malicious things.
(Shocked)

1108
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,510
My friends were all like, we knew it.

1109
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,050
It’s good that there’s one less competitor.

1110
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,190
They were all like that.

1111
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:02,390
But when I told other people that I’m gay.

1112
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:02,460
You look normal. Why do you do that?

1113
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,210
(You look normal. Why do you do that?)
You look normal. Why do you do that?

1114
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:04,540
They would say that.
(You look normal. Why do you do that?)
You look normal. Why do you do that?

1115
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,020
They would say that.

1116
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,120
I’ve heard that too.

1117
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:07,860
You don’t look normal, do you have to be gay?

1118
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,550
(You don’t look normal, do you have to be gay?)
You don’t look normal, do you have to be gay?

1119
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:10,660
Don’t be mad.
(You don’t look normal, do you have to be gay?)
You don’t look normal, do you have to be gay?

1120
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,850
(Don’t be mad.)
Don’t be mad.

1121
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,540
(Don’t be mad.)

1122
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:14,680
(Q. Is it necessary to come out?)

1123
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,180
Is it necessary to come out?
(Q. Is it necessary to come out?)

1124
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:17,820
(Q. Is it necessary to come out?)

1125
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,290
I don’t think it’s necessary.

1126
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:19,960
But,

1127
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:20,980
if someone wants to come out,

1128
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,910
(If someone wants to come out.)
if someone wants to come out,

1129
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:26,500
I would only ask them one thing.
(If someone wants to come out.)

1130
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,060
Can you cut ties with others?

1131
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,940
(Can you cut ties with others?)
Can you cut ties with others?

1132
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,880
(Can you cut ties with others?)

1133
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,300
You have to have that resolve.
(Can you cut ties with others?)

1134
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,820
You have to have that resolve.

1135
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,320
(It takes great resolve to come out because it could hurt you.)
You have to have that resolve.

1136
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,710
Do it only when you have that resolve.
(It takes great resolve to come out because it could hurt you.)

1137
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,980
I would tell them that.
(It takes great resolve to come out because it could hurt you.)

1138
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,590
(It takes great resolve to come out because it could hurt you.)

1139
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:35,860
But I think,
(It takes great resolve to come out because it could hurt you.)

1140
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,510
But I think,

1141
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,690
if there are only two options, must come out vs. not come out.

1142
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:39,890
I choose I must come out.

1143
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,100
You must?

1144
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,720
(You must?)
You must?

1145
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,460
If there are only these two options,
(You must?)

1146
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,470
If there are only these two options,

1147
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,370
I have to come out vs. not come out.

1148
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:44,890
I have to come out.

1149
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:45,560
I choose I have to come out.

1150
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,320
-Why?
-Why? Because I want to come out.

1151
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:47,780
I choose I have to because I want to come out.

1152
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,980
(The men want to be respected for who they are.)
I choose I have to because I want to come out.

1153
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,680
It’s exactly because of people like us who came out.

1154
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,420
People will gradually muster up the courage to do it.

1155
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:56,940
That’s true.

1156
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,460
(That’s true.)
That’s true.

1157
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,470
I had a crush on a classmate when I was in school.

1158
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,910
After you entered the mini home page,

1159
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,560
there was something like

1160
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:09,280
you can write the names of three people you like in order.

1161
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,920
People you like. One two three. Like a rank.

1162
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,780
I wrote his name three times.

1163
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,830
(Eun-chan wrote the name of the person he liked in all three columns.)
I wrote his name three times.

1164
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,560
I wrote his name in all three columns.
(Eun-chan wrote the name of the person he liked in all three columns.)

1165
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,010
(Eun-chan wrote the name of the person he liked in all three columns.)

1166
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,469
Then I clicked OK.
(Eun-chan wrote the name of the person he liked in all three columns.)

1167
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,080
And it was sent to that person?
(Eun-chan wrote the name of the person he liked in all three columns.)

1168
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,580
And it was sent as an email to the owner of the mini home page.

1169
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:20,940
My goodness.

1170
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:20,980
(What then?)
My goodness.

1171
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:21,590
What then?
(What then?)

1172
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,400
And that message
(What then?)

1173
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:22,880
(What then?)

1174
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,219
was spread in the school.
(What then?)

1175
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:25,130
was spread in the school.

1176
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,440
In my class too.

1177
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,000
Really?

1178
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,900
He spread it everywhere.

1179
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,750
I was in so much pain.

1180
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,489
That was devastating.

1181
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,480
I’m different from Eun-chan.

1182
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,429
I get outed very often. I’ve got desensitized to it.

1183
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:40,600
There are so many people insulting me.

1184
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:41,540
Really.

1185
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:41,630
(It just doesn’t affect me anymore)
Really.

1186
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,400
It just doesn’t affect me anymore,
(It just doesn’t affect me anymore)

1187
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:43,889
(It just doesn’t affect me anymore)

1188
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:45,350
no matter what kind of insult I hear.
(It just doesn’t affect me anymore)

1189
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,500
(It just doesn’t affect me anymore)

1190
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,360
I also want to be that strong.

1191
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:48,980
Now you are in the progress of being stronger.

1192
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,620
(Now you are in the progress of being stronger.)
Now you are in the progress of being stronger.

1193
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,300
That's right.
(Now you are in the progress of being stronger.)
Now you are in the progress of being stronger.

1194
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:51,330
(Moved)
That's right.
(Now you are in the progress of being stronger.)
Now you are in the progress of being stronger.

1195
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,760
(Moved)

1196
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,260
So now you've come out to the world.
(Moved)

1197
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,929
So now you've come out to the world.

1198
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,739
I've come out to the world.

1199
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,820
We all come out now.

1200
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,080
(Three men who muster their courage to come out to the world.)
We all come out now.

1201
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:03,450
(Three men who muster their courage to come out to the world.)

1202
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:03,500
Your deepest impression of people's reactions about you coming out of the closet.
(Three men who muster their courage to come out to the world.)

1203
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:03,580
Your deepest impression of people's reactions about you coming out of the closet.

1204
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,290
(Q: Your deepest impression of people's reactions about you coming out of the closet.)
Your deepest impression of people's reactions about you coming out of the closet.

1205
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:06,780
(Q: Your deepest impression of people's reactions about you coming out of the closet.)

1206
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,190
I told my friends and my elder sister.

1207
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,100
My sister said succinctly,

1208
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:14,340
"Just don't steal my man."

1209
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,240
(Just don't steal my man.)
"Just don't steal my man."

1210
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:15,740
(Just don't steal my man.)

1211
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,440
End.
(Just don't steal my man.)

1212
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,340
So cool!

1213
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:17,440
(That's great!)
So cool!

1214
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,440
That's great!
(That's great!)

1215
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:18,580
That's really cool!

1216
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,740
(That's really cool!)
That's really cool!

1217
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,580
(That's really cool!)

1218
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:20,860
What was your parents' reaction to you coming out?

1219
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,160
(Q: What was your parents' reaction to you coming out?)
What was your parents' reaction to you coming out?

1220
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,980
(Q: What was your parents' reaction to you coming out?)

1221
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,180
My mom said, "Really?"
(Q: What was your parents' reaction to you coming out?)

1222
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,610
My mom said, "Really?"

1223
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,180
That's all.

1224
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:28,380
(Cool.)
That's all.

1225
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,290
Cool.
(Cool.)

1226
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,040
That's really cool.

1227
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,540
That's awesome.

1228
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,800
But she wants me to marry a woman.

1229
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:33,380
But you are gay...

1230
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,440
(But you are gay...)
But you are gay...

1231
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,610
She said I must marry a woman.
(But you are gay...)

1232
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:38,890
My mom probably thinks I'm bisexual.

1233
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,210
When I'm on the phone with my mom,

1234
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,110
if I say I'm with my friends,

1235
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,840
she would ask if I'm with boys.

1236
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,030
Because I'm always with boys.

1237
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,710
Now my mom should know I am gay.

1238
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:48,540
What do you want to hear when you come out?

1239
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,730
(Q: What do you want to hear when you come out?)
What do you want to hear when you come out?

1240
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:51,580
(Q: What do you want to hear when you come out?)

1241
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,440
I don't want to hear anything.

1242
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,310
Just be natural.

1243
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,260
Like it is a normal thing,

1244
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,560
as a boy dating a girl.

1245
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,030
If I say I am dating him,

1246
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,920
I hope them to say, "Really?"

1247
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,450
But all my friends were acting like, “I knew it.”

1248
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:08,970
So it doesn't matter to me.

1249
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,170
From my mom to everyone around me, they are the same.

1250
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,940
It's annoying when people start the topic deliberately and pity me.

1251
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,640
There's nothing I want to hear but there's something I don't.

1252
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:18,500
My sister once said something wrong.

1253
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,810
(Because his sister said something wrong, Seon-Yul's mother knew his sexual orientation. )
My sister once said something wrong.

1254
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:20,460
(Because his sister said something wrong, Seon-Yul's mother knew his sexual orientation. )

1255
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,680
She accidentally told my mom I was gay.
(Because his sister said something wrong, Seon-Yul's mother knew his sexual orientation. )

1256
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,260
My mom likes to drink, and once she drinks,

1257
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,930
she will call me and say sorry to me.

1258
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,500
I hope mom will stop saying sorry to me.

1259
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,180
(I hope mom will stop saying sorry to me.)
I hope mom will stop saying sorry to me.

1260
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:32,980
(I hope mom will stop saying sorry to me.)

1261
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:44,080
(Men became serious when talking about parents.)

1262
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,340
My mom thinks she hasn't shown the good side of women in front of me,
(Men became serious when talking about parents.)

1263
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,360
My mom thinks she hasn't shown the good side of women in front of me,

1264
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,590
so she is sorry.

1265
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,600
She thinks it is the reason

1266
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,850
why you have no interest in girls?

1267
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,140
But I really understand.

1268
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,040
(Sad)
But I really understand.

1269
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,240
It's not her fault at all.
(Sad)

1270
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:56,710
Exactly.
(Sad)

1271
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,300
I was born like this.
(Sad)

1272
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:57,620
I was born like this.

1273
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,400
(It's no one's fault, I was born like this.)
I was born like this.

1274
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,380
(It's no one's fault, I was born like this.)

1275
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,440
I want to hear something like "Do you have a boyfriend?",

1276
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,050
"Bring him to meet us."

1277
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,340
Or "How about having a meal together?", something like these.

1278
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,280
(Feel like crying)
Or "How about having a meal together?", something like these.

(Feel like crying)

1280
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:15,860
Why are you crying?
(Feel like crying)

1281
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,700
(Why are you crying?)
Why are you crying?

1282
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:16,940
I just feel sad.
(Why are you crying?)
Why are you crying?

1283
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,580
I just feel sad.

1284
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,690
I know a really awesome parent.

1285
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,590
I've seen her in person.

1286
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,740
When I was performing in Itaewon,

1287
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:26,910
(A friend came to see Hyeon's performance.)
When I was performing in Itaewon,

1288
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,090
one of my friends came.
(A friend came to see Hyeon's performance.)

1289
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,840
But he came with his mom.

1290
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,900
He came with his mom.

1291
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,890
His mom said she was curious about my show.

1292
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,840
(Hyeon's friend and his mom watched Hyeon's show.)

1293
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:38,860
We had a few drinks and went home.
(Hyeon's friend and his mom watched Hyeon's show.)

1294
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,780
We had a few drinks and went home.

1295
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,200
Then the next week my friend came again.

1296
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:45,820
He told me his mom said I am very beautiful.

1297
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,260
(He told me his mom said I am very beautiful and she wanted to watch this interesting show again.)
He told me his mom said I am very beautiful.

1298
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,460
She wanted to watch this interesting show again.
(He told me his mom said I am very beautiful and she wanted to watch this interesting show again.)

1299
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,020
(He told me his mom said I am very beautiful and she wanted to watch this interesting show again.)

1300
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:51,380
I was really jealous at first.

1301
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,650
(Jealous)
I was really jealous at first.

1302
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,140
(Jealous)

1303
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,970
That's what I want to hear from my parents.

1304
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,870
That's great!

1305
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:00,180
Some of my gay friends

1306
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,420
would take their parents to queer parade.

1307
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,950
Because I have such friends,

1308
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:07,120
I was really jealous, and I looked forward to my parents' response.

1309
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,800
But I heard the most terrible words.

1310
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,200
My dad...

1311
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,360
He regretted even marrying my mom.

1312
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:24,300
"If I had not married your mother,

1313
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,590
(If I had not married your mother, then you wouldn't have been born.)
"If I had not married your mother,

1314
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,360
(If I had not married your mother, then you wouldn't have been born.)

1315
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,540
then you wouldn't have been born."
(If I had not married your mother, then you wouldn't have been born.)

1316
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,340
(If I had not married your mother, then you wouldn't have been born.)

1317
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:36,220
(The hurtful words from the person closest to him)

1318
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,060
(Tears in eyes)

1319
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,050
My dad told me about his first love.

1320
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,420
My dad has long since known about my sexual orientation.

1321
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,080
(He knew but didn't want to admit his son's sexual orientation.)
My dad has long since known about my sexual orientation.

1322
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,650
(He knew but didn't want to admit his son's sexual orientation.)

1323
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,460
My dad told me about his first love.
(He knew but didn't want to admit his son's sexual orientation.)

1324
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,340
(He knew but didn't want to admit his son's sexual orientation.)

1325
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:00,320
The last thing he said was that he should have married his first love.

1326
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,500
In that case, I wouldn't have been born.

1327
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:03,740
Perhaps I wouldn't be who I am now.

1328
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,810
(In that case, you wouldn't be who you are now.)
Perhaps I wouldn't be who I am now.

1329
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,140
(In that case, you wouldn't be who you are now.)

1330
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,670
It is kind of...

1331
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,920
(My sexual orientation was considered unfilial.)

1332
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,670
That's it.
(My sexual orientation was considered unfilial.)

1333
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,620
(My sexual orientation was considered unfilial.)

1334
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,460
Do you get along well with your dad now? Do you meet him often?

1335
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,820
Meet him?

1336
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,350
Well, anyway, my dad kind of respected me.

1337
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,800
So, anyway.

1338
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:42,800
Go ahead.

1339
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,090
He won't ask me for details.

1340
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,430
He asks every day like

1341
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:46,460
"What are you going to do, something dad doesn't like?"

1342
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,790
(What are you going to do, something dad doesn't like?)
"What are you going to do, something dad doesn't like?"

1343
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:48,980
I see, work hard.
(What are you going to do, something dad doesn't like?)
"What are you going to do, something dad doesn't like?"

1344
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,180
(I see, work hard.)
I see, work hard.

1345
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,160
(I see, work hard.)

1346
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:51,340
This is the way we get along now.
(I see, work hard.)

1347
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,310
This is the way we get along now.

1348
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,990
Anyway, it's a lot better.

1349
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,680
Depending on how it goes, we might as well cut off relation.

1350
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,230
Yes.

1351
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,520
My dad always believed that there will be a useful medicine in the future.

1352
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,230
Medicine?

1353
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:07,700
Like some kind of psychiatric medicine?

1354
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,170
(Psychiatric medicine?)
Like some kind of psychiatric medicine?

1355
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,000
Psychiatric medicine?
(Psychiatric medicine?)

1356
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,130
Medicine that will cure me.
(Psychiatric medicine?)

1357
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:13,410
He can't understand it at all.

1358
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:18,980
What a sad reality...

1359
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,110
(What a sad reality...)
What a sad reality...

1360
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,110
What a sad reality...
(What a sad reality...)

1361
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,380
(What a sad reality...)

1362
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,080
It was quiet then.

1363
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,370
I felt like crying all of a sudden.

1364
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,180
It was very sad at that time.

1365
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:34,880
(Why is it considered a mental illness?)

1366
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,980
Why is it considered a mental illness?
(Why is it considered a mental illness?)

1367
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,870
There were no such people in my father's days.

1368
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,040
So he can't understand why there are so many gays now.

1369
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,540
There aren't more gays. The gays just hid in dark before.

1370
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,280
Exactly.

1371
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,370
Yes, it really is.

1372
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:52,130
It's true that we gays

1373
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:55,900
suffer the same things inward.

1374
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,470
And what I can not understand is

1375
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,370
people see gays as sissies.

1376
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:03,240
Like the so-called girly gestures,

1377
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,460
they would never stop nagging about them.

1378
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,860
Many gays are not sissy at all.

1379
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:09,620
There are all kinds of gays.

1380
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,680
(Just one of a variety of people)
There are all kinds of gays.

1381
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,350
Ordinary people are different, too.
(Just one of a variety of people)

1382
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,810
Why can't they understand it?
(Just one of a variety of people)

1383
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:15,500
(Now it's Seon-yul's turn talking about this personal topic.)

1384
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,470
Well.
(Now it's Seon-yul's turn talking about this personal topic.)

1385
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:17,540
(Now it's Seon-yul's turn talking about this personal topic.)

1386

(Seon-yul will take the punishment.)

1388
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,690
There are seven punishments anyway.
(Seon-yul will take the punishment.)

(Seon-yul will take the punishment.)

1390
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:25,220
So let's ask Seon-Yul questions.
(Seon-yul will take the punishment.)

1391

(Q: Do you still like the person you were attracted to on your first meeting?)

1396
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,810
It doesn't feel the same anymore.

(Q: The number of people you like now.)

1398

One.

00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,340
OK.

1400
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,280
If we are split from the middle, is he on your left or right?

1401
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,330
On my right.

1402
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:55,810
This side?

1403
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,580
(Nod)

1404
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,700
Do you have any intention to create an opportunity for the two of you?

1405
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,520
Yes, I really do.

I used to like people who are the opposite of me.

1419

I think we will attract each other.

1420
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,130
It doesn't seem like that.

1421

00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:45,400
I may have been prejudiced against people who are like me.

1424

Honestly, I almost cried when playing the jenga.

1485
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,060
It turns out everyone has gone through the same things.

1486
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:57,040
Homosexuality is treated as a mental illness.

1487
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,750
Brothers told their experiences.

1488
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:00,920
After hearing those,

1489
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:03,350
I sincerely hope that people will not look at us

1490
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:05,600
like we are the monkeys in the zoo.

1491
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,860
With that thought in mind,

1492
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,460
I'll have to watch my every word and action.

1493
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:13,620
I haven't come out yet so I don't know.

1494
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:16,810
It's gonna feel so bad and I don't even want to think about it.

1495
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,080
I had a feeling that we were fellow sufferers.

1496
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,780
I barely feel that way before.

1497
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,790
We talked about serious topics one by one.

1498
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:29,420
Why do I always want to cry?

1499
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,760
(Why do I always want to cry?)
Why do I always want to cry?

1500
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,260
(Why do I always want to cry?)

1501
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:36,040
So this is where you become bonded.

1502
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:42,350
What you experience and think in your daily life are pretty much the same.

1503
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:45,400
It's nice to share those things with each other.

1504
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:58,580
(They look strong on the surface but they're weak within.)

1505
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:07,700
(It's late night at some café downtown.)

1506
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:13,700
(What kind of encounter will happen here?)

1507
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,820
(Hi)

1508
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:29,060
(Jeong-ho arrives first.)

1509
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:41,380
(Looking more or less nervous waiting for someone)

1510
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:46,580
(The man who comes to meet Jeong-ho)

1511
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:49,500
(Ding)

1512
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:55,340
(The man Jeong-ho is waiting for is Hyeon.)

1513
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:56,140
What's going on?

1514
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:01,220
(Smile)

1515
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,010
What's going on?

1516
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,660
(Awkward for no reason )

1517
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,210
Please give me the menu.

1518
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:11,920
Hello.

1519
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:12,670
Hello.

1520
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:13,170
Thanks.

1521
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:13,730
Thanks.

1522
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,640
I want a cup of milk tea.

1523
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,400
I want lemonade.

1524
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,900
(The reason why Jeong-ho invited Hyeon over is...)

1525
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,160
There's something I'm curious about you.

1526
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:26,130
Really.

1527
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,740
(Nervous)

1528
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,320
What do you think of me?

1529
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,230
What do I think of you?

1530
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,860
(Panic)

1531
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,740
For you, I was going to...

1532
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:40,650
I was thinking of you as a potential date.

1533
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,340
I was gonna reassess you from 0.

1534
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:46,950
Now I have 0% of favorable impression of Hyeon.

1535
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:48,230
0.1%.

1536
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:49,590
What?

1537
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:54,750
You really feel nothing more than a friend for me?

1538
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,740
-No, I don't.
-No?

1539
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:56,810
(No)
-No, I don't.
-No?

1540
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:57,190
(No)

1541
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:57,960
Ah, really?
(No)

1542
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,500
(No)

1543
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:58,540
-No, I don't.
-No?
(No)

1544
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,040
-No, I don't.
-No?

1545
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:01,140
Ah, really?

1546
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:01,820
I am so sad.

1547
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:02,620
(I am so sad.)
I am so sad.

1548
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,540
(0.1% of love that ends in 0.1 seconds.)

1549
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:04,940
Sorry, Jeong-ho.

1550
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:05,840
(Sorry, Jeong-ho.)
Sorry, Jeong-ho.

1551
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,540
(Sorry, Jeong-ho.)

1552
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:10,170
Even though we know each other and we are friends.

1553
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,880
-We've never had a drink together.
-Yes.

1554
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,120
We just say hello every time.

1555
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,570
Actually, I've learned something new about you, too.

1556
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:18,970
Why?

1557
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:22,210
-We’ve never got to know each other.
-Yes.

1558
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,770
My opinion of you was a little shallow before.

1559
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,840
I don't want to be seen that way.

1560
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,850
-But I see you that way.
-Yes.

1561
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,480
But whenever we talk, it's always deep.

1562
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:40,820
After all, we take part in the show after we came out of the closet.

1563
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:44,520
I think we may be bonded in many ways.

1564
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,870
So today I want to have a further talk with you.

1565
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:50,010
That’s why I asked you out.

1566
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:50,900
Did you invite me here?

1567
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:51,570
(The true reason that Jeong-ho asked Hyeon out)
Did you invite me here?

1568
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:53,120
(The true reason that Jeong-ho asked Hyeon out)

1569
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:53,900
I had no idea at all.
(The true reason that Jeong-ho asked Hyeon out)

1570
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,780
(The true reason that Jeong-ho asked Hyeon out)

1571
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,250
Honestly, in Man's House,

1572
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:05,440
Hyeon and I have been out more than anyone since we came out of the closet.

1573
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,330
So the difficulties and the troubles in reality

1574
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:15,410
should connect us with each other and give us many common topics.

1575
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,320
When can you and me

1576
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,490
talk about these again like today?

1577
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:19,890
I know, right?

1578
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:20,650
Yes.

1579
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:24,390
We don't have a chance to sit and talk like now.

1580
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:24,880
Yes.

1581
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:33,140
(As friends and gays, they understand each other the most.)

1582
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,840
It has crossed my mind.

1583
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:37,860
But when we were playing jenga,

1584
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,700
we talked about all kinds of topics.

1585
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,370
Yes.

1586
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:44,530
Especially about coming out of the closet.

1587
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:45,120
Yes.

1588
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:56,350
I really didn't know you suffered so much.

1589
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,690
Because you look so confident.

1590
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:03,680
I thought people around you were all tolerant to you.

1591
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,060
That's why you're so confident.

1592
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,690
There should be a lot of people who hold such views.

1593
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:08,670
Yes.

1594
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,720
Actually, we are not like that.

1595
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,260
So when talking about those things,

1596
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:18,980
I feel like I could understand you,

1597
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:19,890
a little more.

1598
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,580
And it changed the way I look at you.

1599
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:27,940
Your words are a great comfort for me.

1600
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,040
I mean it. Because my parents

1601
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:37,490
don’t like the fact that I am gay.

1602
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:44,100
They think they will be judged for it.

1603
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,640
But actually they think it’s a shame to them.

1604
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,030
But you talked about your parents,

1605
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:53,000
I think that needs a lot of courage.

1606
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,760
I understand that my parents didn't understand me.

1607
00:49:58,050 --> 00:49:59,520
If I could go back in time,

1608
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:01,950
I would still come out to my parents,

1609
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:03,860
because this is my life.

1610
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:04,600
(Because this is my life.)
because this is my life.

1611
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,140
(Because this is my life.)

1612
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:05,610
Yes.
(Because this is my life.)

1613
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,170
-This is my life.
-Yes.

1614
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:12,000
This is my life, it’s the happy life I want.

1615
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,790
I live because of it.

1616
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:15,650
Because I am the one who is living it.

1617
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,280
What is the point of living if I can’t even be myself?

1618
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:23,300
My goal is being able to do whatever I want

1619
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,930
and whenever I want.

1620
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,490
To me my happiness is the most important.

1621
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:35,220
My goal now is to

1622
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,500
live an interesting life.

1623
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,170
And

1624
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:45,730
make others feel happy seeing me.

1625
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:46,640
That’s my goal.

1626
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,710
Other people could say bad things to me, I don’t care.

1627
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:54,180
Yes.

1628
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:57,580
But I hope that people around me don’t treat me like this.

1629
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:58,350
Yes.

1630
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:07,360
Because when the people you love the most say the worst thing to you...

1631
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:12,560
When we come out, the thing we want to hear the most…

1632
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:13,490
(The thing we want to hear the most)

1633
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:15,310
The one thing we want to hear is
(The thing we want to hear the most)

1634
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:15,900
(The thing we want to hear the most)

1635
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:16,100
“Bring your boyfriend home.”

1636
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,280
(Bring your boyfriend home.)
“Bring your boyfriend home.”

1637
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,040
Yes.
(Bring your boyfriend home.)

1638
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,100
(Bring your boyfriend home.)

1639
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,950
If I could hear this,

1640
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:23,870
it would feel like a dream comes true.

1641
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:25,490
I would be so happy.

1642
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:30,090
-I also hope that
-Yeah, it’s true

1643
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:33,180
My parents would come to watch my performance.

1644
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:37,470
I had the same experience.

1645
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:42,520
I did a modern dance performance with gender as its theme once.

1646
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:47,840
My gay friend brought his parents to watch it

1647
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,280
and they hugged me after the performance was over.

1648
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:53,810
When they hugged me, they said,

1649
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,480
“This is where you belong.”

1652

but no one would admit it.

1671
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,440
My thoughts are exactly the opposite.

1672
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,680
Is it necessary to hide?

1673
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,360
Why do I have to lie?

1674
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:47,490
I don’t think that’s a big deal.

1675
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,200
And I hope everyone could think of coming out as a normal thing.

(Can’t even share my inner thoughts with my friends directly.)

1678
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,210
Who do you like the most in the Men’s House?

1679
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,240
There are two people.

1680
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,460
(Curious)

1681
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:12,290
Chang-min and Hyeok-jun.

1682
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:13,960
I have guessed it right.

1683
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,470
I don’t know.

1684
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:19,180
I’m losing confidence.

1685
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:19,580
Really? I feel the same.

1686
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,610
(Resonate with each other)
Really? I feel the same.

1687
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:20,830
(Resonate with each other)

1688
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:21,360
No, I mean it.
(Resonate with each other)

1689
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:21,380
I am handsome enough.

1690
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:22,490
(I am handsome enough.)
I am handsome enough.

1691
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,160
Yeah.
(I am handsome enough.)

1692
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,400
Really.

1693
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:25,410
No.

1694
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:28,560
We are usually confident people.

1695
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,720
But after I came here, for the first time

1696
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:34,510
I had this feeling, “Am I unconfident?”

1697
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:35,160
And then I would deny it.

1698
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:35,180
How can I be unconfident?

00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:37,440
Me, too.
(How can I be unconfident?)

1704
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:37,900
Right?

1705
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:37,980
Exactly the same.

1706
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:38,570
(Exactly the same.)
Exactly the same.

1707
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:38,820
Me? Why did I have the confidence to come here?
(Exactly the same.)
Exactly the same.

1708
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:38,980

1711
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:43,610
I have this feeling as well.

1712
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:48,000
Honestly, I have another identity called Hokeep.

1713
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:51,760
Whoever like Hokeep would like Jeong-ho as well.

1714
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,480
I want to find someone who also likes shy and passive Jeong-ho.

1715
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,060
You feel the same way, right?

1716
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:57,480
(Me, too.)
You feel the same way, right?

1717
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:57,970
Me, too.
(Me, too.)

1718
00:53:57,970 --> 00:53:58,420
You want to show them your side as Hyeon, right?
(Me, too.)

1719
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:59,780
You want to show them your side as Hyeon, right?

1720
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:00,880
Yes.

1721
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,740
Hyeon is me, and drag artist Sissy is also me.

1722
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:03,840
(Yes.)
Hyeon is me, and drag artist Sissy is also me.

1723
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,450
Yes.
(Yes.)

1724
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,540
(Yes.)

1725
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:06,330
Actually,

1726
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:10,540
this profession to me is more like an actor.

1727
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:15,540
People could get inspiration and power

1728
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,480
from my performance.

1729
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,450
Because these two sides are both me.

1730
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:22,470
I want to meet someone who likes both sides of me.

1731
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,620
Someone who could take care of my luggage

1732
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:28,240
when I was performing.

1733
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:29,110
But to be honest,

1734
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:31,650
the person who is most likely to do this is me.

1735
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:32,250
You know that, right?

1736
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:34,300

1766

Only this part.

-Thank you.

1774
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,350
Very delicious.

Who do you want to give this to?

1776

Do I really need to say it?

1777
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:14,820
Should I seduce Chang-min?

Alright, give it to whoever you want.

1782
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:18,460
You can do whatever you want.

1785
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:23,020
We should take a picture here before leaving.

1786
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,320
Right here.

1787
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,180
Look at the camera.

1788
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:29,970
What Hyeon and I have in common is that

1789
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:35,660
we are of high self-esteem, confident, and outgoing on the surface.

1790
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:38,430
But after spending some time with us,

1791
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:41,410
you would know that we have been hurt before and are mature.

1792
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:49,820
(Can the two find true love in the Men’s House?)

1793
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:54,180
(Men’s House)

1794
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:04,820
(The question card and mailbox outside of the Men’s House)

1795
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,730
Not calling today?

1796
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:09,710
What?

1797
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:10,780
Not calling?

1798
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:11,700
Oh, there.

1799
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,690
Something’s there.

1800
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:14,290
Go out and take a look.

1801
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:14,830
What? What is it?

1802
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:15,350
Should I go out to have a look?

1803
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:16,390
Something’s there.

1804
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:17,140
-The youngest is also going out?
-Tell me what it is later.

1805
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,930
(They discover something through the window.)
-The youngest is also going out?

00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:20,500
Oh, my god.
(They discover something through the window.)

1808
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:21,470
Mail.

1809
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:22,980
-What is it?
-Should we go together?

1810
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:23,880

01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:33,640
(I might cry today.)
I might cry today.

1958
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,100
(I might cry today.)

1959
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,240
I suddenly have this feeling that I might cry today.

1960
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:41,720
We chat a lot at home.

1961
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:47,120
(Talking to Seon-yul and Jeong-ho often)

1962
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,260
I want to go outside to have fun and talk.
(Talking to Seon-yul and Jeong-ho often)

1963
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:52,160
I want to go outside to have fun and talk.

1964
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,790
And maybe eat something nice together.

1965
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:57,880
Is this it?

1966
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:00,000
(Fall)

1967
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,260
Oh, what happened?
(Fall)

1968
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:00,670
(Oh, what happened?)
Oh, what happened?
(Fall)

1969
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:01,220
(Oh, what happened?)

1970
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:01,420
Why didn't it go in?
(Oh, what happened?)

1971
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:01,540
Why didn't it go in?

1972
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:01,980
(Why didn't it go in?)
Why didn't it go in?

1973
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:02,460
(Why didn't it go in?)

1974
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:03,780
Ah, here it is.

1975
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:04,470
(Ah, here it is.)
Ah, here it is.

1976
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:05,940
(Ah, here it is.)

1977
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:17,980
(The last one, Eun-chan.)

1978
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:26,350
(Eun-chan who liked Hyeok-jun from the start and has never changed his mind)

1979
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:28,080
We are more embarrassed.
(Eun-chan who liked Hyeok-jun from the start and has never changed his mind)

1980
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:33,220
(Eun-chan who liked Hyeok-jun from the start and has never changed his mind)

1981
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:38,740
(Eun-chan who hung around with Hyeok-jun all the time)

1982
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:41,310
I don’t want a sweet date.

1983
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:43,510
I have something to say to him after we meet.

1984
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:44,880
So I wrote the letter to him.

1985
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:53,500
(What kind of feelings did the men’s letters carry?)

1986
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:55,260
(His Man)

1987
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,940
Wow, this is crazy.

1988
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,120
I really didn't expect it.

1989
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,090
What kind of couple is this? I have this kind of feeling.

1990
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:05,610
Go.

1991
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:13,180
Hold hands?

1992
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:14,310
Should we hold hands?

1993
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,140
Yes.

1994
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:30,050
Should we hold hands?

1995
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,690
Too soon to decide?

1996
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:34,310
I don’t know.

1997
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:38,770
Good, I hope you feel conflicted because of me.
