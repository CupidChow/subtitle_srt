00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,800
Hey, bro.

159
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,360
Did you two talk before going to bed yesterday?

160
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:22,850
Yeah.

161
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,130
He asked who I had the one-on-one chat with.

162
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,570
So I said with you.

163
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,180
He said he was there too.

164
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,659
Jeong-ho?

165
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,330
Yeah.

166
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,070
It gave me quite a scare though.

167
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,840
So you had a crush on him or not?

168
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:40,540
Did you?

169
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,180
(Did you?)
Did you?

170
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,100
(Did you?)

171
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:44,820
It’s just…

172
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,830
(It’s just…)
It’s just…

173
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,140
(It’s just…)

174
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,300
(Seon-yul’s expression gets subtle because of Hyeok-jun’s reaction.)

175
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,780
(Glancing)

176
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,740
What are they two doing there?

177
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,470
What are they talking about?

178
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,650
Only the two of them are like having a secret date.

179
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,660
The two of them.

180
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:03,940
That’s what old people do.

181
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,020
(That’s what old people do.)
That’s what old people do.

182
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,050
(Ayo)

183
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:05,710
Ayo.
(Ayo)

184
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:05,780
(Ayo)

185
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,340
(Suddenly)
(Ayo)

186
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:06,630
Hey.
(Suddenly)

187
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,100
(Hey)
(Suddenly)

188
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:06,210
(Suddenly)

189
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:06,340
(Suddenly)

190
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:07,800
(Angry)

191
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,820
You’ve got some nerve.
(Angry)

192
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,940
(Angry)

193
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,040
I’ve been watching them from the back.

194
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,340
Anyone wants some sweet?

195
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,120
(Jeong-ho cannot force a smile.)
Anyone wants some sweet?

196
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,830
Me.
(Jeong-ho cannot force a smile.)

197
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,020
(Jeong-ho cannot force a smile.)

198
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,380
(The ride took a fairly long time.)

199
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:26,520
(It’s Namyangju.)

200
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,280
It’s Namyangju.
(It’s Namyangju.)

201
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,980
(It’s Namyangju.)

202
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,159
(Wow)

203
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,420
Wow. It’s really beautiful.
(Wow)

204
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,020
(Wow. It’s really beautiful.)
(Wow)

205
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:36,620
(Wow)

206
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,460
Oh my.

207
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,460
What a place.

208
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,190
It’s so beautiful here.

209
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,120
There’s even a campfire.

210
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,760
Awesome.

211
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,409
(The men’s last dorm. Trailers for camping.)

212
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:49,260
It would look lovely with the fire.
(The men’s last dorm. Trailers for camping.)

213
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:49,980
(The men’s last dorm. Trailers for camping.)

214
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:50,900
Cute.

215
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,400
(Oh, it’s so cute.)
Cute.

216
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,430
Oh, it’s so cute.
(Oh, it’s so cute.)

217
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,580
(Oh, it’s so cute.)

218
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:07,580
(A place with multiple recreational activities)

219
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,340
(What kind of memory will they have here?)

220
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:14,860
My goodness.

221
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,330
(Oh my)
My goodness.

222
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,200
It looks great.
(Oh my)

223
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,060
(Oh my)

224
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,450
Why are there so many trailers?

225
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,390
It’s amazing.

226
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,400
I just felt it was amazing.

227
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,930
I’ve only ever seen trailers or camping cars on TV.

228
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,960
I’ve never seen one in real life.

229
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,470
We’re going to sleep in them.

230
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,409
So how are we going to assign roommates?

231
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:36,080
I was starting to

232
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,250
think all of that.

233
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:40,880
(Drink as much as you want.)

234

Drink as much as you want.
(Drink as much as you want.)

(Drink as much as you want.)

236
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,220
(Let’s have a party today.)

237
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,490
Let’s have a party today.
(Let’s have a party today.)

238
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,640
Can I go in to have a look?

239
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,280
I want to see what it’s like.

240
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:49,900
So cute.

241
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:50,940
(The men are checking out the inside of the trailers.)

242
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,270
Yeah. Have a little tour.
(The men are checking out the inside of the trailers.)

243
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,180
Wow.

244
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:53,460

So this is what it’s like inside.

Amazing.

254
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,470
Amazing.

255
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:05,340
(The trailers that will become a cozy home for the men today)

256
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,430
Wow, it’s really awesome.

257
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:06,460
Dresser. The dresser.

258
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,300
(The dresser)
Dresser. The dresser.

259
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,050
But where’s the bathroom?
(The dresser)

260
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:08,820
-The dresser.

262
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,090
There is none.
(The dresser)

263
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,400
No dresser?

00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,980
No dresser?

265
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,980
(No dresser?)

(No dresser?)

267
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,550
Someone is going mad now because there’s no dresser.

268
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:15,940
Yeah.

269
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,510
Someone is going crazy because there’s no dresser here.

270
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,020
Do you see a dresser over there?

271
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,460
But it’s really great.

(A serious problem)
But it’s really great.

273
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,880

Yeah?
(The dresser)
(A serious problem)

278
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:23,660
You have to go in there.

(What are you doing?)
What are you doing?
(You have to go in there.)

283

It’s like when they burned the witches.

(The place for the campfire)
It’s like when they burned the witches.

286
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,710
This is your home.

You’ll sleep here today.

289
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,800
This is your dresser.

290
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,180
Then it’ll be like real cremation.

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,310
Real cremation.

294
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,650
The trailers are obviously the same.

295
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,000
He looked in our trailer and said,

296
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,140
there’s no dresser here.

297
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,360
(There’s no dresser here.)
there’s no dresser here.

299
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,560
(Do you see a dresser over there?)
(There’s no dresser here.)

300
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,500
Then he started to look for a dresser everywhere.
(Do you see a dresser over there?)
(There’s no dresser here.)

301
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:43,460
(There’s no dresser here.)

302
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,380
(Headache)

303
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,240
I already felt exhausted.

304
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,580
But Jeong-hyeon is a fun guy in nature.

305
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,970
(Immediately. Making up for it.)
But Jeong-hyeon is a fun guy in nature.

307
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,820
So…
(Immediately. Making up for it.)

308
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,660
So…

309
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:57,700
What was the question again?

310
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,890
(What was the question again?)
What was the question again?

311

(What was the question again?)

312
00:09:59,630 --> 00:09:59,700
I forgot the question.
(What was the question again?)

313
00:09:59,700 --> 00:09:59,740
I forgot the question.

314
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,920
(I forgot the question. Ha-ha.)
I forgot the question.

315
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,540
(I forgot the question. Ha-ha.)

316
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,190
Then why don’t we

317
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,840
find something to do?

318
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,690
-I want to go surfing.
-I want to surf too.

319
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,840
-Let’s go surfing.
-That’s one option. Surfing is great fun.

320
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,150
-Any other alternatives?
-Kayak.

321
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,960
Then I want to go kayaking.

322
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,100
Me too.

323
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:14,720
(Me, too.)
Me too.

324
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:14,900
I’ll go kayaking too.
(Me, too.)
Me too.

325
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,020
I’ll go kayaking too.

326
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,410
(I’ll go kayaking, too.)
I’ll go kayaking too.

327
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:15,920
And me.
(I’ll go kayaking, too.)

328
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:15,920
(And me.)
(I’ll go kayaking, too.)

329
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,670
Go kayaking then.
(And me.)
(I’ll go kayaking, too.)

330
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:15,700
(I’ll go kayaking, too.)

331
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,120
Go then.
(And me.)
(I’ll go kayaking, too.)

332
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,540
Go kayaking then.

333
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,170
(Go kayaking then.)
Go kayaking then.

334
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:18,650
Go then.
(Go kayaking then.)

335
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:19,140
(Go kayaking then.)

336
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,000
Are we going to share a room?

337
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,360
Go kayaking then.

338
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,650
We are going to share a room.

339
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,930
-As for the rest of you, suit yourselves.
-We live in the surfing room.

340
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:25,920
Yeah, the surfing room.

341
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,280
We are going to share a room.

342
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,750
And the rest of you, suit yourselves.

343
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,580
We live in the surfing room.

344
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,160
Yeah, surfing room.

345
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,140
Which room do you want?

346
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,830
Which room should we choose?

347
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,560
Number nine.

348
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:32,860
Number nine? Okay.

349
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,030
(Jeong-hyeon is agitated because of the sudden roommate assignment.)
Number nine? Okay.

350
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,320
Don’t you think kayaking is fun?
(Jeong-hyeon is agitated because of the sudden roommate assignment.)

351
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,050
I’ll go kayaking.
(Jeong-hyeon is agitated because of the sudden roommate assignment.)

352
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,160
Just keep paddling like this.
(Jeong-hyeon is agitated because of the sudden roommate assignment.)

353
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,920
I want to go kayaking.
(Jeong-hyeon is agitated because of the sudden roommate assignment.)

354
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,040
How are we going to assign the rooms?
(Jeong-hyeon is agitated because of the sudden roommate assignment.)

355
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,270
It was annoying. I kept having that thought.

356
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,260
That is my place. Something like this.

357
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,810
Only two people wanted to go surfing, me included.

358
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,000
So it was natural that I would stay with Chang-min.

359
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:51,860
Actually,

360
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,610
(I wanted to live with Chang-min anyway.)
Actually,

361
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,640
(I wanted to live with Chang-min anyway.)

362
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,450
I wanted to live with Chang-min anyway.
(I wanted to live with Chang-min anyway.)

363
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,380
(I wanted to live with Chang-min anyway.)

364
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,540
(The two had a private chat last night.)

365
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,870
I just came here and I got this great opportunity.

366
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,230
I got the right to choose my date.

367
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,000
I realized that later.

368
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,790
Yeah.

369
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,440
So I just went dating.

370
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,980
But there are still people I’m curious about after that.

371
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,500
Of course.

372
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,460
So I just…

373
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:19,200
We can make phone calls or write letters to express our affection.

374
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,630
Right.

375
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,720
So I wrote you a letter.

376
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,970
I want to go on a date with you.

377
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,530
Then for you,

378
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:33,420
what do you think of a workaholic like me?

379
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,070
(What do you think of a workaholic like me?)
what do you think of a workaholic like me?

380
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,940
(What do you think of a workaholic like me?)

381
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,300
It doesn’t matter to me.

382
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,000
Really?

383
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,480
Yeah.

384
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,530
I like having a date at home as well.

385
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,950
Just create the opportunity to spend time together if you like each other.

386
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:51,380
You can create a place for that too.

387
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,600
(You can create a place for that too.)
You can create a place for that too.

388
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,630
(You can create a place for that too.)

389
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,220
That’s right.
(You can create a place for that too.)

390
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,380
Some of the things he said made me feel like

391
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,480
(Hyeon had a little hope.)
Some of the things he said made me feel like

392
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,530
there is a glimmer of hope for me.
(Hyeon had a little hope.)

393
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,180
(Hyeon had a little hope.)

394
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:10,420
(The two got closer after the one-on-one chat.)

395
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,300
We might not get to play a lot.

396
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,030
(Hyeon & Chang-min who naturally became roommates)
We might not get to play a lot.

397
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,500
(Hyeon & Chang-min who naturally became roommates)

398
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,350
You mean surfing?
(Hyeon & Chang-min who naturally became roommates)

399
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,140
(Hyeon & Chang-min who naturally became roommates)

400
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:21,500
(And Jeong-hyeon who can’t accept the fact yet)

401
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,520
I want to live together with Hyeok-jun.

402
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,470
I want to live with Hyeok-jun, too.

403
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,480
You want to live with him?

404
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,680
So suddenly?

405
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,180
(Jeong-ho who mustered up the courage and made public his wish)

406
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,340
(And Seon-yul who thinks that this is a sudden move of Jeong-ho)

407
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,060
Maybe I was just confident for no reason.

408
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,780
Yeah.

409
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,090
I made the assumption that I’d definitely live with him.

410
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,330
That’s why I said it.

411
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,500
Actually, I know it clearly

412
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,920
that who I share a room with can make everybody comfortable.

413
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,770
But I didn’t want to give up.

414
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:51,850
I guess you can say

415
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,260
I had gained ambition.

416
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,220
(I had gained ambition.)
I had gained ambition.

417
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,760
Choose your roommate, Hyeok-jun.

418
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:02,500
(The subtle mental war between the two men regarding Hyeok-jun)

419
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:03,560
(Relishing)

420
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,290
-What’s going on?
-Choose one out of two?
(Relishing)

421
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,890
What should I do?

422
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,130
Is this a game?

423
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,080
If only someone could decide for me. That was what I thought.

424
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,700
(Looking away)

425
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:14,980
Then I’ll…
(Looking away)

426
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,310
Then I’ll…

427
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,030
-I haven’t lived with Jeong-ho before.
-Okay.

428
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,200
I’ll live with Jeong-ho this time.

429
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,190
Okay. I’ll live with Chan-gyu.

430
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:20,940
Let’s go.

431
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,790
Where are we going?

432
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,620
Which room?

433
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:24,650
(Observing)
Which room?

434
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,960
Let’s have number three.
(Observing)

435
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,940
(The awkward vibe is clear to everyone.)
(Observing)

436
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:25,340
(Observing)

437
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,900
Okay. Then we’ll have number two.
(The awkward vibe is clear to everyone.)

438
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,780
(The awkward vibe is clear to everyone.)

439
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:26,450
(The awkward vibe is clear to everyone.)

440
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,890
That was the first time someone chose me.

441
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,360
Ah, thank heavens, I thought.

442
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:43,720
To be honest, I haven’t talked much with Jeong-ho.

443
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,610
And on the previous day,

444
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,670
I felt like I wanted to know more about him.

445
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,800
Everybody can see that Seon-yul wants to live together with Hyeok-jun.

446
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,170
But now Jeong-ho decided to stand between them.

447
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:01,340
God, it was so scary.

448
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,100
(God, it was so scary.)
God, it was so scary.

449
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,660
(God, it was so scary.)

450
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,420
Where are we going?

451
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,330
Which room?

452
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,660
Let’s have number three.

453
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,570
Okay. Then we’ll have number two.

454
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,070
Let’s have number three.

455
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,900
Okay. Then we’ll have number two.

456
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,140
(Seon-yul & Chan-gyu became the last two roommates.)

457
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,870
I felt like I was tied up and there was nothing I could do.

458
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,110
There was absolutely nothing I could do here.

459
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,580
(Aggrieved)

460
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:36,700
(I wanted to bury my head in the sand.)

461
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,310
I wanted to bury my head in the sand.
(I wanted to bury my head in the sand.)

462
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,140
(I wanted to bury my head in the sand.)

463
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,360
(Chan-gyu who is put into this awkward situation)

464
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,270
Outside.
(Chan-gyu who is put into this awkward situation)

465
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,570
Anything to drink?
(Chan-gyu who is put into this awkward situation)

466
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,430
No, nothing.
(Chan-gyu who is put into this awkward situation)

467
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,150
(Chan-gyu who is put into this awkward situation)

468
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,730
We need to get some from outside.
(Chan-gyu who is put into this awkward situation)

469
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,720
(Chan-gyu who is put into this awkward situation)

470
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:47,780
After all, Hyeok-jun was the one to choose his roommate.
(Chan-gyu who is put into this awkward situation)

471
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,020

00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,970
So I put on a long-sleeve coat just in case.

624
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,030
It’s okay as long as I won’t get wet.

625
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,460
(Looking back)

626
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,930
Honestly, on the way to go kayaking with Chan-gyu,

627
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,630
I kept thinking

628
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:41,500
about Seon-yul and Hyeok-jun.

629
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,320
(I kept thinking about Seon-yul and Hyeok-jun.)
about Seon-yul and Hyeok-jun.

630
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:44,700
That’s the only thing in my mind.
(I kept thinking about Seon-yul and Hyeok-jun.)
about Seon-yul and Hyeok-jun.

631
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,190
That’s the only thing in my mind.

632
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,340
(Jeong-ho is thinking about Hyeok-jun all the time.)

633
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,900
How do you feel about this place?

634
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,300
-How do you feel about this place?
-It feels great.

635
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,230
Well,

636
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,860
it’s a pity that this is our last day.

637
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,320
Yeah.

638
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,240
If only this caravan date had been arranged on the first day.

639
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,500
Right?

640
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,800
(Nodding)
Right?

641
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,730
(Nodding)

642
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:02,860
I just hoped that
(Nodding)

643
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,170
I just hoped that

644
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,480
we can know each other a little more before we return to the dorm.

645
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,140
What a pity that it’s about to end like this!

646
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,220
Really a pity.

647
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,230
(Really a pity.)
Really a pity.

648
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,180
(Really a pity.)

649
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,500
It's also a pity that Jeong-ho and Hyeon came so late.

650
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,100
I often think about what things would be like if we were together on the first day.

651
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,320
Me, too.

652
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,060
(This must be fun.)

653
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,350
This must be fun.
(This must be fun.)

654
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,660
(This must be fun.)

655
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,070
Looks like we’re going to take that.

656
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:29,780
Ahh, it should be rowed like this.

657
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,680
(Excited about and afraid of kayaking)
Ahh, it should be rowed like this.

658
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,280
Yeah.
(Excited about and afraid of kayaking)

659
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,870
I thought it was like this.
(Excited about and afraid of kayaking)

660
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,100
(Excited about and afraid of kayaking)

661
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,210
-Hello.
-Hello

662
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,140
This kayak, please.

663
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,020
(This way, please.)
This kayak, please.

664
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,190
(This way, please.)

665
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:40,500
Ah, OK.
(This way, please.)

666
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,280
Ah, OK.

667
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,240
It won’t capsize, right? It’s much narrower than I thought.

668
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:47,990
I’m also worried.

669
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,820
(A little dangerous)

670
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,460
(Worried)

671
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,520
This won't capsize, will it?

672
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,560
It won't capsize easily.

673
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,870
Good then.

674
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,090
Just watch out for the waves.

675
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,780
(Safety comes first. Please wear the life jacket before aboard.)

676
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,000
(To row a kayak requires cooperation.)

677
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,930
-Like this?
-Like this?
(To row a kayak requires cooperation.)

678
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:17,820
(To row a kayak requires cooperation.)

679
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,360
(Still unfamiliar with paddling skills)

680
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,230
Try to paddle a little deeper.
(Still unfamiliar with paddling skills)

681
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,780
(Still unfamiliar with paddling skills)

682
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:23,690
We...

683
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,030
-We can be back safe and sound, right?
-Wait a minute.

684
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,690
Hold it like this.

685
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,720
Like this?

686
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,210
Yeah.

687
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,060
Just look at me.

688
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,100
(Learned the knack through Jeong-ho’s guidance)
Just look at me.

689
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,840
Like this.
(Learned the knack through Jeong-ho’s guidance)

690
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,760
(Learned the knack through Jeong-ho’s guidance)

691
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,510
And this.
(Learned the knack through Jeong-ho’s guidance)

692
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,550
(Learned the knack through Jeong-ho’s guidance)

693
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,440
Now this.
(Learned the knack through Jeong-ho’s guidance)

694
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,020
(Learned the knack through Jeong-ho’s guidance)

695
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,990
You said you never rowed it before, but you’re pretty good at it.

696
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,940
I have paddled a boat like this before.

697
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,660
-You’ve rowed this kind of boat?
-Both kayak and raft.

698
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,980
(Now the kayak is stably paddled.)

699
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,460
How is Seon-yul right now? Is he in a bad mood?

700
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,320
How did you know that?

701
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:53,450
Is he angry?

702
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,040
Did he say anything to you?

703
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:59,350
He asked me not to mind him.

704
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,810
But you do, right?

705
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,070
It’s all because of me.

706
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,580
Don’t mind it.

707
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,870
I'm sorry. And now you two still have to share a room.

708
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:12,960
I want to thank you for a lot of things.

709
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,350
For me,

710
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,810
it’s good that we can all stay together.

711
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:17,580
But sometimes I want to spend some time with you alone.

712
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,150
(But sometimes I want to be with you alone.)
But sometimes I want to spend some time with you alone.

713
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:20,890
(But sometimes I want to be with you alone.)

714
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:20,980
That's all, I guess.
(But sometimes I want to be with you alone.)

715
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,160
That's all, I guess.

716
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,160
Is that all? Do you not have feelings for me?

717
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,560
I don’t speak to people who I have no feelings for.

718
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:28,660
Is that so?

719
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,050
(Is that so?)
Is that so?

720
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,260
(Is that so?)

721
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,670
To be honest, among all the brothers,

722
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,750
you’re the one who makes me feel the
most comfortable to talk with.

723
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,240
How to explain this?

724
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,540
Others may find it easy to talk with others.

725
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,030
(It takes a lot of courage for Chan-gyu to say it.)
Others may find it easy to talk with others.

726
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,430
(It takes a lot of courage for Chan-gyu to say it.)

727
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,160
But it's difficult for me
(It takes a lot of courage for Chan-gyu to say it.)

728
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,470
(It takes a lot of courage for Chan-gyu to say it.)

729
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,640
to take the initiative to talk to people.
(It takes a lot of courage for Chan-gyu to say it.)

730
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,620
(It takes a lot of courage for Chan-gyu to say it.)

731
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,840
I’m curious how I would feel now

732
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,860
if I had spent more time with this person.

733
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,800
So among the seven people here,

734
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,810
who do you like most?

735
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,250
Who do you think it is?

736
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,560
I don't know.

737
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,760
-Take a guess.
-Is it me?

738
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,890
It seems to be me. Is it me?

739
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,440
Not a clue.

740
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:31,050
-Right, I like you most.
-Ah, really?

741
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:31,630
Yeah.

742
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,580
Well,

743
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,980
the other guys are also great. They’re all great.

744
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,760
Though you’re the last one to join us,

745
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,960
I spent more time with you

746
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,230
than with everyone else.

747
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,310
But I like someone else, you know?

748
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:51,860
Yes.

749
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,270
(Yes.)
Yes.

750
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,380
(Yes.)

751
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:55,800
I know that.

752
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,350
What do you think of it?

753
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:58,660
To be honest,

754
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,930
about that matter,

755
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,200
I’d be lying if I say I don’t care.

756
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,680
-Do you care about it?
-Of course I do.

757
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,530
Oh, really?

758
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:09,540
To like you or not is up to me.

759
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,820
(To like you or not is up to me.)
To like you or not is up to me.

760
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,180
Also, to like me or not is up to you.

761
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,240
You can decide whom to love for yourself.

762
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,570
That's right.

763
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,300
You don’t have to understand my feelings.

764
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,160
I just want to say thank you.

765
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:30,700
Thank you, too.

766
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,930
(Thank you, too. Thank you for liking me so sincerely.)
Thank you, too.

767
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:32,950
(Thank you, too. Thank you for liking me so sincerely.)

768
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:38,460
Thank you for liking me so sincerely.
(Thank you, too. Thank you for liking me so sincerely.)

769
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:38,670
(Thank you, too. Thank you for liking me so sincerely.)

770
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,740
I don’t know how long
(Thank you, too. Thank you for liking me so sincerely.)

771
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,200
or how deep this love is

772
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,450
and I can't understand it.

773
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,130
But anyway,

774
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,230
thank you for your affection

775
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,220
and for telling me in this way.

776
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,960
It’s not a big deal.

777
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,930
How to respond to Chan-gyu’s confession?

778
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,510
I thought about it.

779
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,220
What should I say to Chan-gyu?

780
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,340
How do I reject him?

781
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,580
I thought about these questions on the way.

782
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,250
But...

783
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,930
We’ve talked a lot about me

784
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:19,870
and a lot about you, Chan-gyu.

785
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,910
I’ve also thought about your feelings for me.

786
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,400
But I...

787
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,610
I still think of you

788
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,930
as a good brother.

789
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,730
It’s okay. Not a big deal.

790
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,980
Yeah.

791
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,840
It’s better to be a good brother

792
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,060
than to be a bad one.

793
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,200
Right.

794
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,690
You are really a good brother.

795
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,010
Very kind.

796
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,000
That’s what I think.

797
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,980
(Finally know Jeong-ho’s true feelings)

798
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:58,790
This is nice.

799
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,320
Really nice.

800
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,070
You know what I mean, right?

801
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,120
(Do you?)

802
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,680
Do you?
(Do you?)

803
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,170
I don't.
(Do you?)

804
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,170
(I don't.)
(Do you?)

805
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,090
You don’t know.
(I don't.)
(Do you?)

806
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:05,780
(Do you?)

807
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,320
It’s not okay then.

808
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,220
I'm not very clear.

809
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,030
Come on.

810
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,940
(Their hearts are going in different directions.)

811
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,380
No matter there are cameras or not,

812
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,520
I've always wanted to do something to you.

813
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,830
But now you don’t?

814
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,730
Nah, I still do.

815
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:35,390
I just want to hug you.

816
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,010
Come on, give me a hug.

817
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,740
Thank you.

818
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,170
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you, too.

819
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:45,010
I haven't been hugged for a long time.

820
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:49,960
So I felt a little hurt but also grateful to him.

821
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,390
Therefore,

822
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,780
I almost cried but I held it back.

823
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,320
It’s really...

824
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,870
It's interesting. I think I’ll have a lot of memories.

825
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,460
(Hyeok-jun stays here alone after Jeong-ho left.)

826
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:06,260
They said they went kayaking.

827
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,200
(Seon-yul got out of the caravan)
They said they went kayaking.

828
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,080
(Seon-yul got out of the caravan)

829
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,410
Do you know where the place is?
(Seon-yul got out of the caravan)

830
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,740
(Seon-yul got out of the caravan)

831
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,260
Oh.
(Seon-yul got out of the caravan)

832
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,700
(Seon-yul got out of the caravan)

833
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:18,940
(after hearing that Jeong-ho and Chan-gyu left.)

834
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,160
(Walking to Hyeok-jun who is alone)

835
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,970
Like this.
(Walking to Hyeok-jun who is alone)

836
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,640
Like this.

837
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,730
Did you try to scare me?

838
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:27,130
I’m sorry?

839
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,240
Did you try to scare me?

840
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,270
What are you doing here alone?

841
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,140
I’m looking over there.

842
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,410
Did you have fun?

843
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,510
I don't know.

844
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,330
Why did you choose Jeong-ho as your roommate?

845
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,930
Was it really because you had never been roommates before?

846
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,130
When you were not here,

847
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,820
Jeong-ho said he wanted to be my roommate.

848
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,900
He has been sharing a room with Chan-gyu,

849
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,550
so he wants to try being roommates with me.

850
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,880
He said that when you were not here.

851
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,120
So that’s how it is.

852
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,460
I was a little sensitive back then.

853
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,400
It seems that way.

854
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,430
I saw Seon-yul was not really happy,

855
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,590
so I thought I could talk to him,

856
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,710
to see why he was not happy.

857
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,710
I think it would be best to tell him how I really feel.

858
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:11,360
(What does Hyeok-jun really think of Seon-yul?)

859
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,030
I should talk to him sincerely.
(What does Hyeok-jun really think of Seon-yul?)

860
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:14,820
(What does Hyeok-jun really think of Seon-yul?)

861
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,060
The things you are worried about.

862
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,200
Is it simply because

863
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:30,000
you don’t know how to answer me?

864
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,420
Or that you don’t know how to choose

865
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,830
between me and Jeong-ho

866
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:40,120
after going on a date with both of us?

867
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,140
I am curious about that.

868
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,860
(Hyeok-jun couldn't easily answer that.)

869
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,610
You can just relax and tell me the truth.

870
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,130
Friends, no. You.

871
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,440
I’m not going to mention others, just you.

872
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,300
I’m not someone that could open up my heart easily.

873
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,250
But when I’m with you, I would talk a lot about how I feel.

874
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,520
So I feel troubled.

875
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,600
I didn't know what kind of feeling this is.

876
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,940
Do I think of you as a friend?

877
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,490
Or is it beyond friendship?

878
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,840
I have been feeling troubled,

879
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,090
but, how do I put it?

880
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:24,520
I feel most connected with you,

881
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,830
and I don’t think it’s because we are close in age.

882
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,180
I learned through this show that

883
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,100
you are an amazing person

884
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,020
and I don’t want to lose you.

885
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,910
(I don’t want to lose you.)
and I don’t want to lose you.

886
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,620
(I don’t want to lose you.)

887
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,450
Which bed do you want to sleep on?

888
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,380
(Hyeok-jun and Seon-yul have talked a lot after they became roommates.)

889
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,180
Is that so?
(Hyeok-jun and Seon-yul have talked a lot after they became roommates.)

890
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,780
(Hyeok-jun and Seon-yul have talked a lot after they became roommates.)

891
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,560
Oh no.
(Hyeok-jun and Seon-yul have talked a lot after they became roommates.)

892
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:44,950
(Hyeok-jun and Seon-yul have talked a lot after they became roommates.)

893
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:45,490
No.
(Hyeok-jun and Seon-yul have talked a lot after they became roommates.)

894
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,230
Do you want to hold hands?

895
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,500
(The two gradually get to know each other’s feelings.)

896
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,120
Just want to be sure,
(The two gradually get to know each other’s feelings.)

897
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,800
(The two gradually get to know each other’s feelings.)

898
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,990
that we all feel the same.
(The two gradually get to know each other’s feelings.)

899
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,610
(The two are now between friends and lovers.)

900
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,260
I am always thinking that whether I like you as a friend,
(The two are now between friends and lovers.)

901
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,550
I am always thinking that whether I like you as a friend,

902
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,930
or as a potential boyfriend.

903
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:14,020
What kind of feeling is this?

904
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,040
Yes.

905
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,010
I understand that...

906
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,100
But how do you feel about Jeong-ho?

907
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:31,260
(Hyeok-jun doesn't speak, just smiles.)

908
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:40,600
As for Jeong-ho, I feel confused emotionally right now.

909
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:46,100
When I felt confused, I was a little moved by him

910
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,020
Don’t you have anything you want to ask me?

911
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,630
(One-on-one talk with Jeong-ho)
Don’t you have anything you want to ask me?

912
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,780
(One-on-one talk with Jeong-ho)

913
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,080
Do you have someone you like in the Men’s House?

914
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,100
Yes, it’s you.

915
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,420
(Yes, it’s you.)
Yes, it’s you.

916
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:55,780
Oh, really?

917
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,300
(Surprised)
Oh, really?

918
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,450
(Surprised)

919
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,120
Really?
(Surprised)

920
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,310
I’m not saying that you are not good enough,

921
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:00,380
but I have the impulse to take care of you.

922
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,340
(Want to take care of you)
but I have the impulse to take care of you.

923
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,430
Do you know that I have been taking care of you secretly?

924
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,100
After what happened today,

925
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,970
(After what happened today,)
After what happened today,

926
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,110
I seem to have changed my mind.
(After what happened today,)

927
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,620
(I seem to have changed my mind.)
(After what happened today,)

(How did Hyeok-jun's feelings change after his chat with Jeong-ho?)

930
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,440
Let’s go.

931
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,560
Let’s go.

932
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:21,700
Let’s go in.

933
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,490
(Let’s go in.)
Let’s go in.

934
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:22,660
Finally, we are going surfing.
(Let’s go in.)

935

(Finally going surfing?)
Finally, we are going surfing.
(Let’s go in.)

936
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,480
I can’t wait, it would be so good.

(Chang-min & Hyeon’s cool indoor surf date)

938
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,620
(What kind of time will Chang-min and Hyeon have here?)

939
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,540
(Wow)

940
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:39,660
I have always wanted to try it.
(Wow)

941
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,670
I have always wanted to try it.

942
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:43,980
(I can already smell the water.)

943
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,540
I can already smell the water.
(I can already smell the water.)

944
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:45,990
Yes.
(I can already smell the water.)

945
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,730
Yes.

946
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:50,180
(Jeong-hyeon and Eun-chan are spying on Chang-min and Hyeon’s date.)

947
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,540
(Getting ready for surfing)

948
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,780
(Peek)

949
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:56,960
(Do you have a mirror?)

950
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,840
Do you have a mirror?
(Do you have a mirror?)

951
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,480
(Do you have a mirror?)

952
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:58,620
Of course.
(Do you have a mirror?)

953
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,460
(Of course.)
Of course.
(Do you have a mirror?)

954
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:07,500
(Wanting to look the best, whenever and wherever)

955
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,340
(Couldn’t give up his beauty)

956
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,920
Chang-min came out.

957
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,060
(Eyes on Chang-min who changed into a surf suit)

958
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:17,420
(In love)

959
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,150
So handsome.
(In love)

960
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,240
Really.
(In love)

961
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,210
It must be fun.

962
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,580
So shy.

963
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,860
(Shy)

964
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:27,810
(They must look so good together, it’s so annoying.)

965
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,680
They must look so good together, it’s so annoying.
(They must look so good together, it’s so annoying.)

966
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,880
I want to go surfing with them.

967
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,540
But my make-up would dissolve in water.

968
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,910
The water is going to mess up my make-up.

969
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,030
So instead of letting him see me like that,

970
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:43,170
I would just wait for them, though it’s a pity.

971
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,040
(Really concerned)

972
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,060
You should start first.
(Really concerned)

973
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,340
You should start first.

974
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,250
(You should start first.)
You should start first.

975
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,100
(You should start first.)

976
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,340
(Chang-min starts surfing first.)

977
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:55,260
Brother Chang-min, brother Chang-min

978
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,530
(Brother Chang-min)
Brother Chang-min, brother Chang-min

979
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,300
(Slender)
(Brother Chang-min)

980
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:56,060
(Brother Chang-min)

981
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,440
Brother Chang-min is so handsome.

982
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,330
Brother Chang-min looks like a Korean Jindo that fell into water.

983
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:07,100
So cute.

984
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,920
(So cute.)
So cute.

985
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,140
(So cute.)

986
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:08,460
Like a golden retriever.
(So cute.)

987
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,820
(Golden retriever)
Like a golden retriever.
(So cute.)

988
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:15,340
(Chang-min immediately finds balance.)

989
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,060
Wow, Chang-min is really good at this.

990
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,080
(Completely conquers the waves)

991
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,700
Brother, fighting!
(Completely conquers the waves)

992
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,380
(Brother, fighting!)
(Completely conquers the waves)

993
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:21,100
(Completely conquers the waves)

994
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:23,940
(Completely conquers the waves)

995
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,820
(Excited)

996
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,140
(Fell. Game over.)

997
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,720
Wow, Hyeon also got up there now.

998
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,500
(Containing)

999
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,960
It’s so easy for him.

1000
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,060
(Hyeon immediately finds his pose.)

1001
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:45,740
Wow.

1002
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,250
(Wow)
Wow.

1003
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:47,260
Wow, he’s so good at this.
(Wow)
Wow.

1004
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,330
Wow, he’s so good at this.

1005
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:54,300
(Jeong-hyeon is containing Hyeon from a distance.)
(Chang-min and Hyeon are being contained.)

1006
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,210
I thought they had to hold hands,

1007
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,730
but they are just surfing.

1008
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:00,500
So you feel better now?

1009
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,250
Yes.

1010
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,750
I think I could go now.

1011
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,420
(but they are just surfing.)

1012
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:15,340
(Jeong-hyeon and Eun-chan went out after feeling better.)

1013
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,780
(They left?)

1014
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,380
(After Jeong-hyeon and Eun-chan left, the two start holding hands.)

1015
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:47,580
(Happy, a private world belongs to only Chang-min and Hyeon)

1016
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,710
Wow, wasn't that super cool?

1017
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,220
But I can’t do surfing.

1018
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,430
Me neither, even if they ask me to.

1019
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,430
-The sun is going down so fast.
-Yeah.

1020
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,950
It’s getting cold.

1021
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:07,020
(Before you know it, the sun is setting.)

1022
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,060
(Seon-yul and Hyeok-jun came back from their walk.)

1023
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:13,540
(Jeong-ho and Chan-gyu also came back from kayaking.)

1024
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,290
(The guys are together again.)

1025
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,790
What’s happening? When did you come back?
(The guys are together again.)

1026
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,540
(The guys are together again.)

1027
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,900
What? You just went in and took a look and left?

1028
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,540
We watched them surfing,

1029
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,659
and cheered them on,

1030
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:26,500
then we went out first.

1031
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,630
It was too stuffy there.

1032
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:28,659
Wait a minute.

1033
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:29,010
(Wait a minute.)
Wait a minute.

1034
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,210
We were talking.
(Wait a minute.)

1035
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,139
Did you go kayaking?

1036
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:32,179
Yes, we did.

1037
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:34,110
Why are you dry? Didn't you fall into the water?

1038
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:34,760
We didn't fall into the water.

1039
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,480
I should have gone kayaking as well.

1040
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,120
But it was tiring.

1041
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,870
Your arms have to keep moving,

1042
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:37,639
rowing like this.

1043
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,670
Rowing is tiring, and my back hurts.

1044
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,380
So we didn't row, we just sat there.

1045
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:41,540
You didn't row and just sat there.

1046
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,929
(Staring)
You didn't row and just sat there.

1047
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:44,139
(Staring)

1048
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,639
If I fell, I would be wet.

1049
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,980
(Jeong-ho and Hyeok-jun looking at each other silently)

1050
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,340
(Turns his head)

1051
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,960
I’ve been observing everyone.

1052
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,430
I observe Seon-yul and Chan-gyu’s expressions as well.

1053
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:06,740
What should I do?

1054
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,460
(Jeong-ho who has been observing others)
What should I do?

1055
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,140
(Jeong-ho who has been observing others)

1056
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,470
We just stayed there quietly.
(Jeong-ho who has been observing others)

1057
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,070
Are we going to keep sitting here?

1058
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,480
At least until Hyeon and Chang-min come out.

1059
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,830
In the meanwhile,

1060
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,590
can I talk to Hyeok-jun?

1061
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,380
can I talk to Hyeok-jun?

1062
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,340
Of course.

1063
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:26,640
(Shy, embarrassed)
Of course.

1064
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,220
(Shy, embarrassed)

1065
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:32,900
(The men having a panic seeing Jeong-ho asks for a date directly)

1066
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,410
Let’s go have a chat.

1067
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,050
(Jeong-ho worked up his courage and fought for some alone time with Hyeok-jun.)

1068
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,830
Feel like I was called away.
(Jeong-ho worked up his courage and fought for some alone time with Hyeok-jun.)

1069
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:41,820
(Jeong-ho worked up his courage and fought for some alone time with Hyeok-jun.)

1070
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,940
Follow me to the ally in the back.
(Jeong-ho worked up his courage and fought for some alone time with Hyeok-jun.)

1071
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,540
(Jeong-ho worked up his courage and fought for some alone time with Hyeok-jun.)

1072
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,860
My feelings were complicated, maybe a little bit sad.

1073
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,220
(Feeling complicated)
My feelings were complicated, maybe a little bit sad.

1074
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:47,740
(Feeling complicated)

1075
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,120
Not very happy.

1076
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:56,460
(What will the two men talk about?)

1077
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,220
(His Man)

1078
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,340
Starting to care about the looks now.

1079
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,190
(The men’s last night together)
Starting to care about the looks now.

1080
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:00,820
(The men’s last night together)

1081
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,630
How can he trample on you like this? Just ask the youngest and me to do it.
(The men’s last night together)

1082
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,220
(The men’s last night together)

1083
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:10,260
(The last supper of the 8 men)

1084
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,580
(What memories will the men have?)

1085
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:15,700
(The last camping night)

1086
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,500
So good.
(The last camping night)

1087
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,620
(The last camping night)

1088
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:24,180
(Complicated feelings between friendship and love)

1089
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,420
So delicious.

1090
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,550
Go eat.

1091
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,850
I’m so full.

1092
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,740
I could feel Seon-yul is taking care of me.

1093
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,170
I felt that several times.

1094
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:43,200
I think Seon-yul is a good person.

1095
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,780
(The men who open up their hearts)

1096
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,280
Jeong-ho, are you busy?

1097
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,000
No.

1098
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,530
Let’s go have a date with me.

1099
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,210
What are they talking about?

1100
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:06,220
(Why did Seon-yul suddenly call Jeong-ho away?)

1101
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,340
(The men’s feelings are still undetermined at the last minute.)
