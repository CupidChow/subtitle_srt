How do we assign roommates this time?

00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,710
We will share a room.

Do what you want.

26
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,780
It's so annoying. I kept having thoughts like that.

27
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:21,920
(Actually, I wanted to share a room with Chang-min.)

(A triangle relationship that unsettles the men)

Then I'll…

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,280
Because I haven't stayed with Jeong-ho before.

35
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,900
So I decided to share a room with Jeong-ho.

You are very kind.

47
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,930
I have also deliberated over my feelings for you,

48
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,420
if I am seeing you as a potential partner.

49

Are we going to keep staying here?

50
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,860
I need to consider Seon-yul, and Chan-gyu as well.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,140
I have said this in my mind a hundred times.

52
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,740
I'll go have a date with Hyeok-jun.

53
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,890
Have a date.

54
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,990
Can I have a word with Hyeok-jun in private?

57
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,930
Yeah.

58
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,410
Will it be boring to take a walk again?

59
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,970
No, it's okay.

00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,380
(Hahaha)

163
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,420
(Shy)

164
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:47,570
(Jeong-ho expresses all his feelings without reservation.)

165
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,280
This is too…
(Jeong-ho expresses all his feelings without reservation.)

166
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,060
(Jeong-ho expresses all his feelings without reservation.)

167
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,780
Delicious.

168
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,450
(Delicious.)
Delicious.

169
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,100
(Delicious.)

170
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,300
(Cute)

171
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,360
Your mouth is really big.

172
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,620
(Looking at Hyeok-jun's every little move)

173
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:01,960
(Do you want a tissue?)

174
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,990
Do you want a tissue?
(Do you want a tissue?)

175
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,300
No, you didn't get it on your face.

176
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,900
I just thought maybe you'd mind.

177
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,870
You don't?

178
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,300
(The moment that's sweet and warm like coffee)

179
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,500
How did you feel about the bike ride?

180
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,300
The bike?

181
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:18,990
(The bike?)
The bike?

182
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:19,740
(The bike?)

183
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,580
Pretty good.

184
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,350
But it's not the bike ride that matters.

185
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,340
I just like being with you.

186
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,140
It was great because I did it with you.

187
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,820
(Nod)

188
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,190
Compared to what I do,

189
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,840
whom I do it with matters more.

190
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,920
How did you feel about the bike ride?

191
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,800
You don't have to answer as I did.

192
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,080
For me,

193
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,350
I felt good because I hadn't ridden a bike for long.

194
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,540
Oh. Ah, really?

195
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,990
(Oh. Ah, really?)
Oh. Ah, really?

196
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,500
(Oh. Ah, really?)

197
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,540
(That's all?)

198
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,120
But it's good to have a talk.

199
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,890
Like this.

200
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,180
To have a date with you again.

201
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:07,740
Me too.

202
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,490
(Me too.)
Me too.

203
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,190
(Me too.)

204
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:09,970
Yeah.
(Me too.)

205
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:10,660
(Me too.)

206
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,140
Yesterday we…

207
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,670
(Stuttering)
Yesterday we…

208
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,380
Yeah.
(Stuttering)

209
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,020
(Stuttering)

210
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,260
Yeah, it was pretty good.

211
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:14,900
(Yeah, it was pretty good.)
Yeah, it was pretty good.

212
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,660
(Yeah, it was pretty good.)

213
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:17,540
I feel so shy.

214
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,720
(I feel so shy.)
I feel so shy.

215
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,500
(I feel so shy.)

216
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,720
You seem pretty good at expressing your feelings.

217
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,430
-Me?
-I feel like you are the expressive type.

218
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,250
Yeah, that's right.

219
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,440
I like to express how I feel immediately.

220
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,730
Don't feel burdened by it?

221
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,920
No, I like that.

222
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,220
Really? Thankfully.

223
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,600
I said it yesterday.

224
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,530
I like it.

225
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,560
Actually, I'm pretty worried.

226
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,490
So was I yesterday.

227
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,060
I said it with the expectation of the worst-case scenario.

228
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,260
I didn't expect you to say yes.

229
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,580
Most people I met

230
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,990
would feel burdened because I'm proactive in expressing my feelings.

231
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:00,690
Why?

232
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,760
I think it's a good thing.

233
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,460
Yeah?

234
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,100
That's good then.

235
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,670
(Thankfully.)
That's good then.

236
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,300
(Thankfully.)

237
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,720
I think an expressive personality is really good.

238
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,360
You like expressive people?

239
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:17,700
Me?

240
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,010
(Me?)
Me?

241
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,500
(Me?)

242
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,730
It's better than to keep silent.

243
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,510
But…

244
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,140
I don't think you have to…

245
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,840
Be like this.

246
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,500
I don't really pay attention (to whether they are expressive or not).

247
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:31,280
(I'm fine with either.)

248
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,370
I'm fine with either.
(I'm fine with either.)

249
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,220
What? You are not very expressive, bro.

250
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,100
I feel you are not very good at expressing yourself.

251
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,360
No, I'm good at it.

252
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,070
Really?

253
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,630
That's nice.

254
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,200
Nice?

255
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,120
Yeah, that's really good.

256
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,650
We'll get along well.

257
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,500
(Ha-ha)

258
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,410
(Staring)

259
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,230
Yeah.
(Staring)

260
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,780
(Staring)

261
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,570
However,

262
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,450
honestly, I was really worried.

263
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,300
Why?

264
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,030
Worried?

265
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,720
Yeah.

266
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:06,510
Why is that?

267
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,120
It's just...

268
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,700
I was worried that I wouldn't be able to stay with you.

269
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,660
I was afraid we wouldn't be able to share a trailer.

270
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,340
Yeah.

271
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,150
Well,

272
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,130
even though I would fight for that opportunity no matter what,

273
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,910
things could have gone the opposite of what I intended.

274
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,880
I was pretty worried about that.

275
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,370
It worried me too about asking you here for a date.

276
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:33,540
Why?

277
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:33,960
(Why?)
Why?

278
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,110
(Why?)

279
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,820
Because I didn't know what you'd say.
(Why?)

280
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,470
Because I didn't know what you'd say.

281
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,280
I feel like you are a time bomb.

282
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,100
Why? Where did that come from?

283
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,580
(Joking)
Why? Where did that come from?

284
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,060
(Joking)

285
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,180
I was afraid.
(Joking)

286
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,080
I was afraid.

287
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,910
I have been anxious.

288
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,630
Because this is not a game.

289
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,880
If Hyeok-jun doesn't like me,

290
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,940
he might reject me by saying something like

291
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,970
"let's just be good buddies".

292
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,950
So I was anxious.

293
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:10,700
To tell the truth, I felt pretty good taking with you yesterday.

294
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:16,250
And I felt pretty good hugging you in the end.

295
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,380
I felt really good.

296
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,060
And I'm a little…

297
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:23,660
(Curious)

298
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,310
A little…
(Curious)

299
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,840
(Curious)

300
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,640
How do I put it?
(Curious)

301
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,090
(Curious)

302
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:27,260
I really like the sweetness in your eyes.
(Curious)

303
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,370
I really like the sweetness in your eyes.

304
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,010
Your eyes gave me the feeling yesterday.

305
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,260
Really?

306
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:34,820
(Really?)
Really?

307
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,130
(Really?)

308
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,620
So I really liked it.
(Really?)

309
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,080
So I really liked it.

310
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:37,740
My eyes are always like this, even now.

311
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,300
(My eyes are always like this, even now.)
My eyes are always like this, even now.

312
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,980
(Ah)

313
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,140
I'm so shy.

314
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,910
You haven't tasted the dessert.

315
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:53,540
You want a try?

316
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,300
(You want a try?)
You want a try?

317
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:54,800
Yeah.
(You want a try?)

318
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,010
(Yeah.)
(You want a try?)

319
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:54,380
(You want a try?)

320
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:55,620
Can I feed you?
(Yeah.)
(You want a try?)

321
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,200
Can I feed you?

322
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,460
(Eat)

323
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,410
Did I get it on my face?

324
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,010
Let me see.

325
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:03,780
Did I?

326
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,060
There's a bit on your lips.

327
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,540
(Here)
There's a bit on your lips.

328
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,380

339
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,940
(Going out to look for Eun-chan)

340
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:49,260
(Jeong-hyeon is putting on perfume suddenly.)

341
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,600
(Free time before dinner)

342
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,310
Dear.

357
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,840
Oh, what are you doing?

358
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:07,660

What?
(What?)

363
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,310
Why do you keep going in and out of our room?
(What?)

364
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:12,780
I came because I thought Eun-chan was here, okay?

(I came because I thought Eun-chan was here, okay?)
I came because I thought Eun-chan was here, okay?

(God. What?)

377
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,270
There's no other pillow?

378
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,500
You put on too much perfume.

379
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,470
Pull the quilt a little.

380
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,820
There's a reason that they let us do it this way.

381
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,440
(Jeong-hyeon lies between them naturally.)
There's a reason that they let us do it this way.

382
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,910
Yeah. Because you might injure your neck.
(Jeong-hyeon lies between them naturally.)

383
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,240
I'll sleep here today.

00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,370
Sounds good.

385
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,540
I don't know if I'll sleep here or not.

386
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:44,660
Why?

387
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,460
(Why?)
Why?

388
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,140
(Feet kicking)
(Why?)

389
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:45,140
(Why?)

390
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,280

(Hey)
Hey, stop it.

395
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,140
(Hey)

396
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:53,860
I won't go easy on you.
(Hey)

397
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,140
I won't go easy on you.

398
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,650
(I won't go easy on you.)
I won't go easy on you.

399
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,820
(I won't go easy on you.)

400
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,140
I'm sleepy.

401
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,470
(Ah, I'm sleepy.)
I'm sleepy.

402
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,260
(Ah, I'm sleepy.)

403
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:02,340
It's so cold.
(Ah, I'm sleepy.)

404
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,350
It's so cold.

405
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,730
It's so cold.

406
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,020
Put on your coat. Take out some clothes and put them on.

407
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,490
Or shall I give you one of my hoodies?

408
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,500
Oh, hoodies?

409
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,230
Mmm.

410
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:20,180
(Chang-min takes out his clothes because Jeong-hyeon feels cold.)

411
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:20,460
Open it.

412
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,430
(Open it.)
Open it.

413
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,180
(Open it.)

414
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,580
(Ow)

415
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,120
Or you can wear a sweater.

416
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,700
Sweater isn't bad.

417
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:28,780
I think sweater is better.

418
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,770
Wear a T-shirt underneath it.

419
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,620
I don't have a T-shirt that can be worn underneath.

420
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,320
You don't have such a T-shirt?

421
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,440
What's in your suitcase? Tell the truth.

422
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,220
Cosmetics?

423
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,790
Or is there someone hiding in your suitcase?

424
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,630
Guest No. 9 is hiding in there, isn't he?

425
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,270
Tell the truth.

426
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,000
Did you finally bring him?

427
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:04,740
(Jeong-hyeon puts on Chang-min's hoodie.)

428

(In the meantime, Hyeon and Chang-min begin to prepare for dinner.)

429
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,510
Wow, what's this?
(In the meantime, Hyeon and Chang-min begin to prepare for dinner.)

430
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,330
Preparation for barbecue.

431
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:14,540
Really?

432
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,070
(Really?)
Really?

433
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:15,740
(Really?)

434
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,920
The charcoal fire is blazing merrily.

435
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,210
What have you done today?

436
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,020
Me?

437
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,080
I've been talking and chatting.

438
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,820
With whom?

439
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,650
Eun-chan.

440
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,110
You're really like sisters.

441

You seem to get along well.

442
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:31,100
Is there something between you two?

Put it on the table.

457
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,050
Thank you very much.

458
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,410
Did you buy meat?

459
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,190
I volunteer to grill meat.

460
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:47,960
Me too.

461
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,860
You can't.

(Decisively)
You can't.

463
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,780
(Decisively)

464
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,180
Why don't you let me do it even if I want to?

465
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,020
(Why don't you let me do it even if I want to?)
Why don't you let me do it even if I want to?

466

You seem not to know how to grill meat.

You can wash the dishes later.

469
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:57,340
Oh, no.

470

(Oh, no.)
Oh, no.

471

(Hyeok-jun and Jeong-ho come back from dating.)

What are you talking about?

482
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,230
It's possible that you're over the moon.

I'm going to wash the vegetables.

493
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,250
I'm going to wash the vegetables.

494
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,930
Chan-gyu, come and give me a hand.

495
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,180
(Go ahead)

496
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:27,580
Are you going to stand there and watch your brother do the washing?

497
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,510
(Chan-gyu and Seon-yul are washing vegetables.)
Are you going to stand there and watch your brother do the washing?

(Chan-gyu and Seon-yul are washing vegetables.)

499
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,660
Did we buy this? Why is it...

500
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,180
Because it's in the middle.

501
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,760
(Chan-gyu who picked the lettuce defends himself.)
Because it's in the middle.

502
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,980
I didn't see it clearly.
(Chan-gyu who picked the lettuce defends himself.)

503
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:39,700
I trusted you so much.

00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,580
(Ouch)
I trusted you so much.

505
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,120
(Ha-ha)

506
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,100
All right. All right.
(Ha-ha)

507
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,180
It won't take us ages to finish, will it?

They may think, "When will they come back?"

512
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,380
Many visitors come here in family groups, right?

It must be fun.

519
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,390
Chan-gyu, have you ever been to such places with your family?

520
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,650
No.

521
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,750
It's today then. Today we're a family.

522
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:03,260
I'll be your uncle.

Is it the right way?

530
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,540
This way.

531
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,460
They haven't started eating, have they?

532
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,500
If they have, I'm going to scream.

533
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,370
What are you gonna say?

534
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,180
I will say, "That's too much!"

535

(The two come back after washing the vegetables for a long time.)
I will say, "That's too much!"

540
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,990
Can I just put it in?

541
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,250
Yeah, it's okay.

542
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,880
Who said he wanted to camp here?

543
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,460

547
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,400
Why? Don't you like it?

548
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,940
I'm in a very good mood.

549

(Ha-ha-ha)

I've already given up.

581
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,790
I've let go of it and sorted out my feelings.

It may happen if you sleep together.

599
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:01,930
I won't do that if I really like someone.

00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,780
(Chang-min helps Jeong-ho with some meat.)

637
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,190
Yummy.

638
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,900
It's really good eating while grilling.

639
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,650
Eat it directly after it's grilled.

640
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,570
Shall we feed the men we like with meat wrapped in lettuce?

641
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,550
OK.

642
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,000
Let's wrap meat for brothers.

643
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,440
Do we have to?

644
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,590
(Jeong-hyeon feeds Chang-min first.)

645
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:33,660
Thanks.
(Jeong-hyeon feeds Chang-min first.)

646
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:33,860
Thanks.

647
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,490
(Thanks)
Thanks.

648
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,660
(Thanks)

649
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,370
But the meat is really good.

650
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:41,540
Is it because of the environment

651
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,780
(I want too.)
Is it because of the environment

652
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,120
or the meat is grilled well?
(I want too.)

653
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,350
Wrap one for Jeong-ho.

654
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,490
For Jeong-ho.

655
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,680
For Jeong-ho.

656
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,870
Sorry, Hyeon.

657
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,330
I think I don't need yours.

658
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:53,850
Shut up, please.

659
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:53,900
I won't feed you.

660
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,910
(Humph, I won't feed you.)
I won't feed you.

661
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,420
(Angry)
(Humph, I won't feed you.)

662
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:54,460
(Humph, I won't feed you.)

663
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:55,700
No, my mouth is full.

664
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:55,740
(Mumbling Mumbling)
No, my mouth is full.

665
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,580
(No, my mouth is full.)
(Mumbling Mumbling)
No, my mouth is full.

666
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:56,740
Come on, have another one.
(No, my mouth is full.)
(Mumbling Mumbling)
No, my mouth is full.

667
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,610
Come on, have another one.

668
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,190
(What's going on?)

669
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,010
What's going on?
(What's going on?)

670
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,460
(What's going on?)

671
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,030
But it's really good.

672
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,820
It tastes even better when we eat it here.

673
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,490
It's really tasty.

674
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,840
People always say the one who grills the meat does the hard work.

675
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,710
Exactly.

676
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,490
You did a good job.

677
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,740
(Satisfied)

678
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,410
You're really good at this.

679
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,090
Because I like to eat.

680
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,850
It will make me happy if you finish all the meat.

681
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:37,180
(Jeong-hyeon keeps feeding Chang-min.)

682
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:38,980
Chang-min made himself an example.

683
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,680
It's hard when you step forward

684
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,420
and volunteer to do something no one else is willing to do.

685
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,380
So I kind of

686
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,260
feel that I've found

687
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,780
(I've found the right person.)
feel that I've found

688
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,950
the right person.
(I've found the right person.)

689
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,740
(I've found the right person.)

690
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,300
Who should I feed?

691
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,100
I haven't had any meat wrapped by Eun-chan.

692
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,220
(Bursting with cuteness)

693
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,220
(Wow)

694
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,300
Ow.
(Wow)

695
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:01,700
Brother, it's for punishment.

696
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,160
(Brother, it's for punishment.)
Brother, it's for punishment.

697
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,620
(Brother, it's for punishment.)

698
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,410
(Frozen)

699
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:04,580
I put lots of garlic in there.
(Frozen)

700
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,390
(I put lots of garlic in there.)
I put lots of garlic in there.
(Frozen)

701
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:06,580
Just kidding. Kidding.

703
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,640
(Just kidding. Kidding.)
Just kidding. Kidding.

704
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,700
(Just kidding. Kidding.)

705
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:08,860
How about it? Tasty?

706
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,990
(How about it? Tasty?)
How about it? Tasty?

707
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,460
(How about it? Tasty?)

708
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:10,900
Mmm, I can only taste kimchi.

709
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,700
(Mmm, I can only taste kimchi.)
Mmm, I can only taste kimchi.

710
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:15,300
I've never been picked since I came here.

711
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,830
(I've never been picked since I came here.)
I've never been picked since I came here.

712
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,020
I'll pick you. Here, ah.
(I've never been picked since I came here.)
I've never been picked since I came here.

713
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,040
I'll pick you. Here, ah.

714
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:21,440
(It isn't for punishment, is it?)

715
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,380
-It isn't for punishment, is it?
-No, it isn't.
(It isn't for punishment, is it?)

716
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,380
(No, it isn't.)
-It isn't for punishment, is it?
-No, it isn't.
(It isn't for punishment, is it?)

717
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,420
I was going to give it to them.

718
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,710
(Mmm)
I was going to give it to them.

719
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,130
(Mmm)

720
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:27,180
Eun-chan, didn't I pick you once?
(Mmm)

721
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,800
Eun-chan, didn't I pick you once?

722
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:30,270
(Feels awkward right away)

723
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,940
Oh, other than that time.
(Feels awkward right away)

724
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,820
Eun-chan, you got flowers, didn't you?

725
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:34,470
(Though you threw them away.)

726
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,480
Though you threw them away.
(Though you threw them away.)

727
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:35,500
Though you threw them away.

728
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,230
(Though you threw them away.)
Though you threw them away.
(Though you threw them away.)

729
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:36,540
May I help him to explain it?
(Though you threw them away.)
Though you threw them away.
(Though you threw them away.)

730
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,720
May I help him to explain it?

731
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,790
You didn't throw the flowers away, right?

732
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,650
No, he didn't.

733
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,190
Eun-chan, nor did you throw the night light away, right?

734
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,500
You just put the flowers in the room temporarily, didn't you?

735
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:49,700
I feel like I'm going to have indigestion.

736
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,140
(I feel like I'm going to have indigestion.)
I feel like I'm going to have indigestion.

737

(I feel like I'm going to have indigestion.)

738
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:57,580
(Because it was the first time I got flowers.)

739
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,320
Those who want to grill meat come over with tongs and scissors.

740
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,130
We need help.

741
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,000
I want to do it.

742
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:07,220
Here.

743
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:07,570
(Here Very fast)
Here.

744
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:07,820
(Here Very fast)

745
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,370
OK.
(Here Very fast)

746
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,040
(Here Very fast)

747
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,180
Do it well.
(Here Very fast)

748
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:09,260
Do it well.

749
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,020
(Do it well.)
Do it well.

750
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,600
OK.
(Do it well.)

751
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,020
Don't look down on me. I've worked part-time at a bbq restaurant.

752
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,070
(Insists on confirming the facts)
Don't look down on me. I've worked part-time at a bbq restaurant.

753
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,260
Which bbq restaurant?
(Insists on confirming the facts)

754
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,090
I don't remember.

755
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,340
(Panicked)

756
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,860
(A shaky start)

757
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,510
(Ha-ha-ha)

758
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,610
It caught on fire.
(Ha-ha-ha)

759
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,660
No, the smoke came to me as soon as I sat down.

760
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,410
I think you've never grilled meat before.

761
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,900
(Seeing that Eun-chan is suffering from the smoke,)

762
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,420
No. What are you talking about?
(Seeing that Eun-chan is suffering from the smoke,)

763
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,700
(Seon-yul comes to help him.)

764
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,560
Brother, are you here to help me?

765
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,110
Yeah.

766
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,440
You didn't eat much, did you?

767
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,060
I ate a lot.

768
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,240
-Go over there and have some more.
-I'm really full.

769
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:54,980
For many moments, I feel Seon-yul was taking care of me.

770
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,060
Hyeok-jun seemed to be embarrassed because of me.

771
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,240
(The two had been staying together in the theme park.)
Hyeok-jun seemed to be embarrassed because of me.

772
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,460
(The two had been staying together in the theme park.)

773
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,750
But you've been true to your heart.
(The two had been staying together in the theme park.)

774
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,530
So I was a little touched.

775
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:03,700
I want to hear Seon-yul sing.

776
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,700
(I want to hear Seon-yul sing.)
I want to hear Seon-yul sing.

777
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,750
My love.

778
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:08,980
Great!

779
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,680
(Great!)
Great!

780
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,400
(Great!)

781
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:11,420
You feel tired easily after thirty.
(Great!)

782
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:11,980
You feel tired easily after thirty.

783
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,860
(Eun-chan gets attached to Seon-yul's loving care.)
You feel tired easily after thirty.

785
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,940
(On the contrary, Seon-yul seems to have mixed feelings.)

786
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,690
(After the dinner)

787
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,660
Move it over directly?
(After the dinner)

788
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,100
Jeong-ho, are you busy?

789
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,200
No, I'm not.

790
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,280
Would you have a date with me?

791
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:25,800
OK.

792
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,680
(After half of the day, Seon-yul tries to talk with Jeong-ho.)

793
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:28,780
What does he want to say?
(After half of the day, Seon-yul tries to talk with Jeong-ho.)

794
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,790
What does he want to say?

795
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,440
I'm so scared.

796
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:33,830
Just go ahead.

797
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,060
(The two head to the trailer for a talk.)

798
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,600
-Oh, why is the light out?
-Exactly.

799
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,870
Is the switch down here?

800
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:46,900
It's here.

801
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,680
(It's here.)
It's here.

802
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,420
(It's here.)

803
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,810
Did I make you uncomfortable just now?

804
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:53,370
No, I just feel sorry.

805
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,250
No, no.

806
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,290
I shouldn't be angry with you.

807
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,390
It's just

808
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,260
there are times when you

809
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,220
keep asking a person who cares about it if he's all right...

810
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:02,460
Exactly. Exactly.

811
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,470
(Exactly. Exactly.)
Exactly. Exactly.

812
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,260
That's why I tried to avoid communication.
(Exactly. Exactly.)

813
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,560
That's why I tried to avoid communication.

814
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,940
I know what you mean.

815
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,920
(Seon-yul & Hyeok-jun)
Hyeok-jun and I have missed each other all the time.

816
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,580
(Seon-yul & Hyeok-jun)

817
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,350
It's not easy for us to have some alone time. So...

818
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,350
I...

819
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,500
I really didn't know it.

820
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,070
Yeah, that's why I'm unhappy.

821
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:26,900
I can see that it bothers you a lot.

822
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,460
I feel so guilty about it.

823
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,350
But I haven't completely come to my senses yet.

824
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:30,860
I just can't help it.

825
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,170
When I'm in this kind of situation,

826
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,440
I would behave like I did today.

827
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,560
I understand.

828
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,440
If you feel bad for me

829
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,890
and thus make a different decision...

830
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,100
You wouldn't do that anyway.

831
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:47,580
You're right.

832
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,190
(You're right.)
You're right.

833
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,300
(You're right.)

834
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,940
Let's go. We still need to help with the campfire.

835
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,020
Okay.

836
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,970
(Okay.)
Okay.

837
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:55,820
(Okay.)

838
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,900
(The two resolved the misunderstanding and are relieved.)

839
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,180
Oh, it's hot.

840
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,800

Oh, it's hot.

Get cooked quickly.

849

It's my first time roasting marshmallows.

(Roasting)

851
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,520
Tongs? Do we have tongs?

Seon-yul was sitting still there.

898

The moment the stick was moved, he dashed over here.

899

Only mine is not cooked yet.

Throw out this romance terminator.

What will we do tomorrow? Our last day here.

920
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,440
Tomorrow we'll have the last round of matching.

921
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,560
The campfire party will be fun.

922
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,510
At the end of this kind of trip or retreat,

923
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,670
there usually will be a campfire party or a fireworks show.

924
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:22,020
"Is it really over?" I would think something like that.

925
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,870
We will hardly meet in the future, right?

926
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,930
I mean, all of us gather together like this.

927
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,880
It's hard.

928
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,680
It must be hard to gather everyone.

929
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,590
Didn't we agree to go to Seon-yul's home to watch TV?

930
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,280
Yeah, right.

931
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,190
This week has just flown by.

932
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,130
Even on the second day I still felt

933
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,080
the time didn't pass by as fast.

934
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,270
Yeah, like that.

935
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,210
For me, time went by slowly before Hyeon came.

936
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:50,630
After a certain moment, it just passed fast.

937
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,630
Time went by fast suddenly after we grew close.

938
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,220
I was homesick in the beginning.

939
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,580
And I didn't miss home anymore after we got familiar with each other.

940
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,870
I didn't miss home even at the beginning.

941
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:04,690
Is that so?

942
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,820
I think everyone is great.

943
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,810
Have you started image management already?

944
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,960
How could you trample on my sincerity?

945
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,380
The youngest boy, I want to talk to you alone.

948
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:16,460
After a certain moment,

949
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,340
I started counting how many nights we have left.

950
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,690
And I've been a little sad since then.

951
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,180
I got mixed feelings.

952
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,940
During the days we've spent together,

953
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,170
(Q: Who are you most grateful to?)
During the days we've spent together,

954
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,010
who are you most grateful to?
(Q: Who are you most grateful to?)

955
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,180
(Q: Who are you most grateful to?)

956
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,760
Too many.

957
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,320
Me, too.

958
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,950
I want to thank everyone, for different things.

959
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,330
I also want to thank everyone, I mean it.

960
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,390
Could everyone answer this question? I'm
curious.

961
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,860
I broke down on the terrace once.

962
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:41,940
At that time...

963
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,090
(Why?)
At that time...

964
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:42,620
Why?
(Why?)

965
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,400
(I know it.)
(Why?)

966
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:42,460
(Why?)

967
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:43,660
I was angry with myself.
(I know it.)
(Why?)

968
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,320
I was angry with myself.

969
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,640
I suddenly recognized the reality and cried.

970
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,900
But then I thought of what Seon-yul said to me

971
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,360
and calmed down.

972
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:55,700
Hello, everyone.

973
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,240
(The day Jeong-ho just came to the Men's House)
Hello, everyone.

974
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,250
(The day Jeong-ho just came to the Men's House)

975
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,280
Hello.
(The day Jeong-ho just came to the Men's House)

976
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:57,460
Hello, everyone.

977
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,440
(Blushed because of the alcohol)
Hello, everyone.

978
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,660
(Blushed because of the alcohol)

979
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,350
It seems that Chan-gyu really likes drinks.

980
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:02,380
I didn't know you would come.

981
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,670
(Chan-gyu was depressed for leaving a bad impression on Jeong-ho.)
I didn't know you would come.

982
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,140
(Chan-gyu was depressed for leaving a bad impression on Jeong-ho.)

983
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:05,740
I think I know what this is.

984
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,250
(Chan-gyu's feelings for Jeong-ho were made public by accident.)
I think I know what this is.

985
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,740
(Chan-gyu's feelings for Jeong-ho were made public by accident.)

986
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,490
(Nothing went smoothly.)

987
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,160
Anyone would know that's the letter we wrote before.
(Nothing went smoothly.)

988
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:20,620
(Chan-gyu sat on the terrace for long to regulate his emotions.)

989
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,360
I didn't know that Jeong-ho would come. I even drank some beer.

990
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,090
When I just came here, I felt a little...

991
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,560
We were all new here and only I held a can of beer.

992
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,820
I hate to be seen like that by the person I like.

993
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,380
(Awkward)

994
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,500
(Jeong-ho left his spot.)

995
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,910
I became sensitive.

996
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,950
Everything went against me that day.

997
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,390
Before I came to the Men's House,

998
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:48,500
I always had an illusion

999
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,070
(Nodding)
I always had an illusion

1000
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:50,460
that someone would like me no matter how.
(Nodding)
I always had an illusion

1001
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,710
that someone would like me no matter how.

1002
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,120
I thought that way in the beginning.

1003
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,720
Anyway,

1004
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,810
I didn't get the call, twice.

1005
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:58,300
Therefore,

1006
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,970
I recognized the reality after that.

1007
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,950
And I had a good cry.

1008
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,270
What should I do in the future?

1009
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:11,710
I don't know if I'm doing the right thing now.

1010
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:12,980
But well,

1011
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,750
for the record, I must tell you

1012
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,340
that plus you, we have eight people here.

1013
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:19,740
Eight people.

1014
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,270
Yes.

1015
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:24,650
Eight is just a small number of people.

1016
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,840
A really small number.

1017
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:28,910
So the reason why no one chose you

1018
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,330
is not that you have some shortcomings.

1019
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,860
(Seon-yul is listening to Chan-gyu's
troubles attentively.)

1020
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,390
This feels great.
(Seon-yul is listening to Chan-gyu's
troubles attentively.)

1021
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,340
(Seon-yul is listening to Chan-gyu's
troubles attentively.)

1022
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,270
You will be popular after you leave this place.

1023
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:41,930
I'm not.

1024
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,850
There will be people who like you.

1025
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:45,520
You're right.

1026
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,090
If Seon-yul hadn't talked to me at that time,

1027
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:55,980
could I have regulated my emotions and go back to the room?

1028
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,530
The one I'm grateful to is Chang-min.

1029
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,680
(Surprised)

1030
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,310
Oh, really?
(Surprised)

1031
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:01,820
(Surprised)

1032
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,220
Why?

1033
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:02,670
(Why?)
Why?

1034
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,570
Just.
(Why?)

1035
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,270
He made supper for us all the time.

1036
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,060
When we said we were hungry,

1037
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:20,100
(Chang-min is making supper for the hungry men.)

1038
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,120
he was like, "Do you want something to eat?" and then went to cook.

1039
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:28,490
I think he's a cute younger brother. I'm grateful to him.

1040
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,140
(Thank you.)

1041
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:29,930
Thank you.
(Thank you.)

1042
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,460
(Thank you.)

1043
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:30,530
(You're welcome.)

1044
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:31,390
You are welcome.
(You're welcome.)

1045
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,420
(You're welcome.)

1046
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,710
For me, it's Eun-chan.

1047
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:36,990
(Uh-huh?)

1048
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,500
Uh-huh?
(Uh-huh?)

1049
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:37,830
(Uh-huh?)

1050
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,060
I laughed a lot thanks to him.
(Uh-huh?)

1051
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,500
I laughed a lot thanks to him.

1052
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:41,470
I did.

1053
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:41,700
Really?

1054
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,440
(Really?)
Really?

1055
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:42,790
(Really?)

1056
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:42,900
Everyone agrees with it.
(Really?)

1057
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,140
Everyone agrees with it.

1058
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,670
(Feel the same)
Everyone agrees with it.

1059
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:44,700
Because Eun-chan laughed a lot.
(Feel the same)

1060
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,860
Because Eun-chan laughed a lot.

1061
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:45,870
(Moved)
Because Eun-chan laughed a lot.

1062
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,000
Thank you.
(Moved)

1063
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,720
I wanted to say Jeong-hyeon, but I held it in.

1064
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,520
But still thank you, Jeong-hyeon.

1065
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,170
Though you didn't do it for me,

1066
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,690
you tried your best to do makeup for everyone.

1067
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,240
Ah, right.

1068
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,010
Our youngest brother.

1069
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,390
I want to give a special thanks to Hyeon.

1070
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,040
Ah, really?

1071
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,970
After Hyeon came, he has been trying to create a pleasant atmosphere.

1072
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,510
Thank him for doing that very much.

1073
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:09,460
As for me,

1074
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,790
I want to thank Seon-yul.

1075
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:16,100
Seon-yul always comforted the person

1076
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,400
who was in low spirits.

1077
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,580
I saw him talking with others many times.

1078
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:22,590
(Right.)
I saw him talking with others many times.

1079
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,340
Right.
(Right.)

1080
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,580
(Right.)

1081
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:24,860
It's not easy to listen to others.
(Right.)

1082
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,730
It's not easy to listen to others.

1083
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,700
But he did it a lot.

1084
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,630
So I think he's a good man.

1085
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,040
(Q: What's the most memorable date?)

1086
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,450
Any memorable date?
(Q: What's the most memorable date?)

1087
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,060
(Q: What's the most memorable date?)

1088
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,770
Memorable date.

1089
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:42,960
Yeah, the first date.

1090
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,020
The first date left quite an impression.

1091
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,280
We lost our shoes.

1092
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,120
Yeah.

1093
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,840
I almost came back barefoot.

1094
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,770
Ah, really?

1095
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,140
Bye.

1096
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:53,600
(Hyeon's first date was paragliding with Hyeok-jun.)
Bye.

1097
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:53,960
(Hyeon's first date was paragliding with Hyeok-jun.)

1098
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,620
I'm going.
(Hyeon's first date was paragliding with Hyeok-jun.)

1099
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,530
(Hyeon's first date was paragliding with Hyeok-jun.)

1100
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,310
Go, go, go.
(Hyeon's first date was paragliding with Hyeok-jun.)

1101
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:56,420
Run, run, run!

1102
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,450
(Run, run!)
Run, run, run!

1103
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:57,880
Run!
(Run, run!)
Run, run, run!

1104
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,750
It's okay.

1105
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,440
OK.

1106
00:32:59,660 --> 00:32:59,850
(Hyeok-derella lost his shoes from running.)

1107
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:00,480
Run!
(Hyeok-derella lost his shoes from running.)

1108
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,150
It's okay.
(Hyeok-derella lost his shoes from running.)

1109
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:01,490
(Hyeok-derella lost his shoes from running.)

1110
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,030
OK
(Hyeok-derella lost his shoes from running.)

1111
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,060
(Hyeok-derella lost his shoes from running.)

1112
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:03,580
My shoes fell off. What to do?

1113
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,670
(My shoes fell off. What to do?)
My shoes fell off. What to do?

1114
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,170
Shoes.
(My shoes fell off. What to do?)

1115
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,190
It was my first time paragliding.

1116
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,100
Maybe because I got nervous or something,

1117
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,010
my heart beat fast.

1118
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,380
He said his heart was beating fast

1119
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,300
and suddenly put my hand on it.

1120
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,100
My heart was beating really fast.

1121
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,180
I suddenly...

1122
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,570
Feel my heat.

1123
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,780
Oh, it's beating pretty fast.

1124
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,390
Really fast.

1125
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,820
The weather was lovely.

1126
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:31,040
The coffee shop was picturesque.

1127
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,000
The food was tasty.

1128
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,480
It gave me a deep impression.

1129
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,770
I've thought about it and find

1130
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,880
that the most memorable date seems to be also the first date.

1131
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:45,650
Yeah.

1132
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:50,140
Because I was curious who would come.

1133
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,270
Yeah, right, right, right.

1134
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:56,780
(Eun-chan was nervous on his first date.)

1135
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:00,810
Hello.

1136
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:01,780
Hello.

1137
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,050
(Bowing)
Hello.

1138
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:02,800
Nice to meet you.
(Bowing)

1139
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,140
Let's shake hands.

1140
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:03,600
(An awkward and exciting first meeting in memory)
Let's shake hands.

1141
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,210
Ah, OK.
(An awkward and exciting first meeting in memory)

1142
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,130
Nice to meet you
(An awkward and exciting first meeting in memory)

1143
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,389
The first eye contact with Seon-yul impressed me the most.

1144
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:12,380
Eun-chan's back when he was sitting there waiting for me

1145
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:14,440
was very cute.

1146
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,920
He was cute when he got nervous.

1147
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:25,000
I'll keep that moment in my memory forever.

1148
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,880
A moment when both of us were nervous.

1149
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,040
The day

1150
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,100
I went on the lake date.

1151
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,570
Was it?

1152
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:32,190
Yeah.

1153
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,219
The day I went there.

1154
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,370
Why?

1155
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,300
The place, the time, and the weather are all perfect.

1156
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,699
So everything was perfect.

1157
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:43,760
(The moment when everything is perfect)
So everything was perfect.

1158
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,340
(The moment when everything is perfect)

1159
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,520
Why did everything look so perfect?

1160
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,620
(Wink)

1161
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:52,199
Maybe it's because "beauty is in the eye of the beholder".

1162
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:55,900
(Shy)

1163
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,130
I also think that the first date

1164
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,100
gave me the most goosebumps.

1165
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,700
(Gave me the most goosebumps.)
gave me the most goosebumps.

1166
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,600
(Why?)

1167
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,680
Now thinking about it,
(Why?)

1168
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,140
it really gave me goosebumps.
(Why?)

1169
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,420
Because you saw him in his true colors?

1170
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,260
Maybe you saw something we didn't get to see.

1171
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,290
(The first meeting that gave you goosebumps)
Maybe you saw something we didn't get to see.

1172
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,020
(The first meeting that gave you goosebumps)

1173
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,820
Hello.

1174
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,940
(Shy)

1175
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,460
(Jeong-ho brought flowers that he picked as a gift.)

1176
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,860
(Touched)

1177
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,890
(Thump Thump the atmosphere is full of tension and excitement)

1178
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,260
Ah, I'm really nervous.
(Thump Thump the atmosphere is full of tension and excitement)

1179
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,220
(Thump Thump the atmosphere is full of tension and excitement)

1180
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,560
We saw each other in a very

1181
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,000
anticipating and nervous state.

1182
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,580
When we saw each other,

1183
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,340
we were so nervous that we were shaking.

1184
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:37,510
(Yes.)
we were so nervous that we were shaking.

1185
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,120
Yes, that's right.
(Yes.)

1186
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,140
I was trembling.

1187
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,830
As for me,

1188
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,080
it was when I went on a walk with Seon-yul.

1189
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:50,280
The flowers outside were really pretty.

1190
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,220
Look, flowers.

1191
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,700
-This one is in full bloom.
-So pretty.

1192
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,310
I was not admiring the flowers on my own. I was with him.

1193
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,320
So it left an impression.

1194
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,530
Let's toast.

1195
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,620
What are we toasting for?

1196
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:03,920
We toast for my love.

1197
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,690
Oh, really?

1198
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,230
Oh, it's great.

1199
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,810
Because I don't want to watch others fall in love.

1200
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,340
So we toast for my love, OK?

1201
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,260
One, two, three.

1202
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:10,280
(Toast for my love.)
One, two, three.

1203
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,700
Toast for my love.
(Toast for my love.)

1204
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,780
Toast for my love.

1205
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,350
How often do we get to spend time

1206
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:19,470
with people who are neither our families nor friends?

1207
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,480
Thinking about this,

1208
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,300
I feel really good.

1209
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:32,220
(Men are saving their last memories on the camping site.)

1210
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,850
Really, it was so interesting, I'm shocked.

1211
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:47,050
But we think you are the interesting one.

1212
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,810
-We think you are the interesting one.
-We should award Eun-chan.

1213
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,170
You are unique.

1214
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,820
We should give you an award, and hold an award ceremony.

1215
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,390
You are truly unique.

1216
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,600
-Come on, let's go to sleep now.
-OK.

1217
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,790
-So tired.
-I happen to want to sleep now.

1218
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,740
(The last night before the final choice)

1219

(Peeking)

1222
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:12,900
You scared me.
(Peeking)

1223
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,510
You scared me.

1224
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,220
What are you doing?

1225
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:14,440
(What are you doing?)
What are you doing?

(What are you doing?)

1227

What do you mean?

1228
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,840
It's just like what you see.

1229
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:17,940
It's just like what you see.

(Chan-gyu falls asleep first with the help of alcohol)

My thought was to

00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,290
go back to the first day.

1240
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,480
Go back to the start as nothing has ever happened.

Like, what can I do if I like him?

Yeah, right.

like puppy love

00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,290
I really like it.

1265
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,190
Once this is over,

1266
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,610
when we go our separate ways home,

1267
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,830
I think I'll feel very empty.

1268
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:57,550
I held Eun-chan's hands and kept saying "laughing sisters".

1269
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,460
But I might snore. Will you be able to fall asleep?

1270
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:01,990
I'm really fine with it.

1271
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:02,750
What? Snore?

1272
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,060
But what if it was really loud like earth quake?

1273
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,140
Then I will go out quietly and sleep cuddling Chang-min instead.

1274
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:07,260
Sleep cuddling Chang-min.

1275
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,300
(Sleep cuddling Chang-min)
Sleep cuddling Chang-min.

1276

1277
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,730
(Gosh.)

1278
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:10,740
Ah, I couldn't fall asleep.
(Gosh.)

1279
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,790
(Ah, I couldn't fall asleep.)
Ah, I couldn't fall asleep.

1280
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:12,310
(Ah, I couldn't fall asleep.)

1281
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:12,540
Using me as an excuse.
(Ah, I couldn't fall asleep.)

1282

Using me as an excuse.

1283
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:13,780
Eun-chan's snore is too loud.

1284
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,800
(Eun-chan's snore is too loud.)
Eun-chan's snore is too loud.

Being roommates with Jeong-hyeon,

1289
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,610
I was talking with him all night.

1290
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:29,530
I was actually want to stay with Seon-yul.

1291
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,480
In our own room,

1292
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,370
I want to talk about some trivial matters or heart-felt topics with him.

1293
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,280
I really want to try that.

1294
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,940
(Pity)

1295

1297
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:43,820

1305
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,260
You hit your head again?

1306
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,700
(It must hurt.)

1307
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,660
(A few hours ago, Hyeon was on his way to the trailer.)

Can you just hug me?
(Please hug me.)

1320

Can you just hug me?

1321
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,160
Honey, I am a little tired today.

1322
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,250
Then just lie down.

1323
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,340
Cuddle and sleep?

1324
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:26,180
No, I'm shy.

Yes.

1351
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,780
It's strange.

No, there's no need.

It will be what if I don't choose you?

I don't know, it will be horrible.

00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:45,750
To be honest, I hate tomorrow.

1420
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:46,670
Me too.

1421
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,210
It will feel so empty.

1422
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,850
But it's kinda,

1423
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,890
I'm feeling kinda strange.

1424
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,460
(The laughing sisters feel reluctant to leave on the last night.)

1425
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:00,040
The three of us should sleep together tonight.

1426
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,980
Even though you said so,

1427
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:03,700
-you would sneak out to be with Chang-min, right?
-I will sleep in my room.

1428
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,500
(-Keeping Chang-min to yourself. -I will sleep in my room.)
-you would sneak out to be with Chang-min, right?
-I will sleep in my room.

1429
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,260
(How do you know it?)

1430
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:09,740
Don't you try to trick me.

1431
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,020
I could see through you.

1432
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:11,740
It's really funny.

1433
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,660
(It's really funny.)
It's really funny.

1434
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,180
(It's really funny.)

1435
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,550
It feels like a dream.

1436
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,710
Yeah, it feels like a dream.

1437
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:23,750
When I go to work the next day, it will feel like

1438
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,590
waking from a long dream.

1439
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:27,850
It's like a really happy dream.

1440
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,950
I feel you two would make a couple.

1441
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,780
I'm not sure.

1442
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:39,940
(His Man, who will be the final couple?)
