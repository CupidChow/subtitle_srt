25
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,380
We just played darts downstairs

26
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,170
and decided where we are going to sleep.

27
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,700

Brother, where do you want to sleep?

34
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:57,670
-Are we gonna choose a bed?
-Yeah.

35
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,820
Let's be fair and decide with darts.

36
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,980
It would be fun to play a game to decide.

37
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,070
Then let's play a game to decide.

(OK)
OK.

I'd like to sleep in a spacious place.

43
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,280
But none of us are very big.

44
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,690
Because I'm a restless sleeper.

45
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,490
The person sleeping next to me is going to suffer.

46
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:18,860
OK.

47
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,220

I think we have the winner.

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,380
I'm gonna get the first place and pick my partner.

67

How did he do that?

68
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:44,579

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,820
How should we assign the beds, champion?

117
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,620
(Nervous and curious)

118
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,860
I'll let you sleep in my place.

119
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,020
Oh.

120
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,940
Okay. Thank you.

121
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,010
I heard Jeong-hyeon always talks in his sleep,

122
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,730
so I don't really want to share a bed with Jeong-hyeon.

123
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,500
I don't know if he gave me his place

124
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,030
because of that.

125
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,510
I thought Chang-min was very thoughtful.

126
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,660
(Did Chang-min switch places for Jeong-ho?)

127
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,330
I decided to share a bed with Jeong-hyeon,

128
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:20,329
because I like Jeong-hyeon best among them three.

129
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,580
Then I'll share a bed with Chang-min.

130
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,380
Jeong-ho and Chan-gyu will sleep in the same bed.

131
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,390
I'll sleep in the next bed.

132
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,440
-Thanks.
-Let's move.

133
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,490
Am I gonna sleep in the same bed with Chang-min?

134
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,770
Honestly, I laughed,

135
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:35,940
so I tried to keep a poker face.

136

(Sorry that I laughed.)
Because Jeong-hyeon talks in his sleep.

143
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,880
So I was a little worried.
(Sorry that I laughed.)

144
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,140
Does he talk a lot in sleep?

(Everyone is happy with the assignment of the beds.)

(Everyone is happy with the assignment of the beds.)

147
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,480
Is it because I never slept in the same bed with him and I didn't notice?
(Everyone is happy with the assignment of the beds.)

148
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
I don't know.

(Jeong-ho is helping Chan-gyu make breakfast.)

I don't even know that.

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:23,870
(In and out of sleep)
Think about what to cook for breakfast.

159
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,480
I've decided what to make.
(In and out of sleep)

160
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:25,670
(In and out of sleep)

161
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,660
What?
(In and out of sleep)

162
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,660
I'll simply make some toasts.

163
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,330
(Cute)
I'll simply make some toasts.

164
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,540
(Cute)

165
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,920
Do you cook well?

166
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,270
Do you cook well?

167
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,830
I'm not really good at cooking.

168
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,790
Oh, really?

169
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,850
Don't you cook for yourself?

170
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,010
I cook for myself.

171
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,760
I usually cook at the workplace.

172
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,990
I don't cook much at home.

173
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,370
Oh, really?

174
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,220
(Chan-gyu and Jeong-ho are intimately washing dishes together.)

175
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:06,140
(At the same time, the men who slept in are also getting up.)

176
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,940
(Frying)

177
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,700
(Muddled)

178
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,300
(Get curious)

179
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:18,390
(Whispering. Can't we read that?)

180
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,880
Can't we read that?
(Whispering. Can't we read that?)

181
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,460
(Whispering. Can't we read that?)

182
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,500
(The thing that intrigued Jeong-ho is...)

183
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,130
Can't we read that?
(The thing that intrigued Jeong-ho is...)

184
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:23,900
(The thing that intrigued Jeong-ho is...)

185
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,290
No, well...

186
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,900
How about we take a look first

187
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,070
before the others get here?

188
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,680
Okay.

189
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,420
(Curious Curious)

190
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,140
(Jeong-ho panicked after reading the card.)

191
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,930
What? What is it?

192
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,260
There's a special event today.

193
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,260
Please go back to your rooms and pack up your stuff.

194
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,640
Change into comfortable clothes and gather.

195
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,240
I only saw comfortable clothes.

196
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,820
Are we gonna do something?

197
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,710
Are we gonna play sports

198
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,659
or do something that we have to use strength?

199
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:58,800
(Wow, it smells so good.)

200
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,520
Wow, it smells so good.
(Wow, it smells so good.)

201
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:00,580
Oh!

202
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,110
(Oh)
Oh!

203
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,660
(Oh)

204
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,220
What's that?

205
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:02,600
(What's that?)
What's that?

206
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,420
Read the card. I already did.
(What's that?)

207
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,710
Read the card. I already did.

208
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,380
There's a special event today.

209
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:08,460
Change into comfortable clothes and gather.

210
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,740
(A special event)
Change into comfortable clothes and gather.

211
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,190
Comfortable clothes?

212
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,590
I don't know if it means tracksuit or something else.

213
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,640
But I've dressed up.

214
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,170
That's how you dress up?

215
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,170
Looks like you're gonna go up there again.

216
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,220
I got up early.

217
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,830
Tracksuit?

218
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,140
Have you read the card?

219
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,260
(Have you read the card?)
Have you read the card?

220
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,260
(The message reached the quad room.)
(Have you read the card?)

221
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,330
The card?
(The message reached the quad room.)

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:29,820
(The message reached the quad room.)
(Have you read the card?)

224
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,100
What is it?

225
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,770
(What is it?)
What is it?

226
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:30,940
(What is it?)

227
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,260
We're asked to pack up our stuff.
(What is it?)

228
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:31,300
We're asked to pack up our stuff.

229
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,060
(We're asked to pack up our stuff.)
We're asked to pack up our stuff.

230
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,300
Pack up our stuff?
(We're asked to pack up our stuff.)

231
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:32,900
(Pack up our stuff?)
Pack up our stuff?
(We're asked to pack up our stuff.)

232
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:32,980
Yeah.
(Pack up our stuff?)

233
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,659
(Yeah)
Yeah.
(Pack up our stuff?)

234
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,700
(Flustered)

235
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,180
(Stop functioning)
(Flustered)

236
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:36,740
It'll take a lot of time to pack.

237
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,680
(We're asked to pack up our stuff?)
It'll take a lot of time to pack.

238
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:38,780
We're asked to pack up our stuff?
(We're asked to pack up our stuff?)

239
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,540
(Pack up our stuff)
We're asked to pack up our stuff?
(We're asked to pack up our stuff?)

240
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,880
Pack up our stuff.

241
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,100
Do we have to pack?

242
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,780
(Do we have to pack?)
Do we have to pack?

243
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,940
They are not asking us to pack our suitcases, right?

244
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,200
I think it's about packing up our stuff in the room.

245
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,060
(Seon-yul comes back after changing his elaborate clothes into something comfortable.)

246
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:53,510
(Placing)

247
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,260
Do we have to use placemats?
(Placing)

248
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,140
(Placing)

249
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,590
It's Jeong-ho's first breakfast here after all.

250
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,090
I can't believe I'm the one who made Jeong-ho his first breakfast here.

251
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,660
What to do? He needs to eat something good.

252
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,420
(Chan-gyu is carefully preparing Jeong-ho's first breakfast.)

253
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,140
(Stir-frying)

254
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:19,620
(Not like what he's worried about, the cooking goes well.)

255
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:19,940
Good morning, everybody.

256
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,700
(Good morning, everybody.)
Good morning, everybody.

257
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,620
Oh, my God.

258
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,720
(Eun-chan and Hyeon noticed the card.)
Oh, my God.

259
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,420
(Eun-chan and Hyeon noticed the card.)

260
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,380
Ah, comfortable clothes.

261
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,270
You look pretty comfortable right now.

262
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,360
I do.

263
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,039
I think I need to be more comfortable.

264
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,080
Should we get prepared mentally?

265
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,500
(Worried)

266
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,929
Breakfast will be ready soon.

267
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:46,160
Would you guys come over?

268
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,900
(Delicious and tasty)

269
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,860
(Eight men greet the morning together.)

270
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,080
Who made the breakfast?

271
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,730
Me.

272
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,730
Oh, really?

273
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,720
It's very thoughtful of you.

274
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,420
(Thankfully)

275
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,160
Did you read the card that says we need to pack up our stuff?

276
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,040
-Did they ask us to pack?
-But pack what?

277
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,530
What are we supposed to pack?

278
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,400
I don't know.

279
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,520
-Does it mean we should get ready to leave?
-With our suitcases.

280
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,630
Let's get our suitcases packed.

281
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,750
-Let's get our suitcases packed.
-Are we gonna get our suitcases packed?

282
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,560
Then go home in comfortable clothes.

283
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,520
Are they gonna send one person home?

284
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,550
Go home?

285
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:19,880
(No way)

286
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,810
Go away.
(No way)

287
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:20,970
(No way)

288
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:21,660
Ah.
(No way)

289
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,180
Ah.

290
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:22,210
(A morning full of speculations about the card's contents)
Ah.

291
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,930
(A morning full of speculations about the card's contents)

292
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:25,380
I've been thinking
(A morning full of speculations about the card's contents)

293
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,550
I've been thinking

294
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,950
it would be great if we don't have to exchange our rooms.

295
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,490
That's all I've been thinking about.

296
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,730
Me, too. Me, too.

297
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,090
I think my current room is good.

298
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,480
Our room is the only one where we can share a bed.

299
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,760
Sleep in the same bed.

300
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:36,860
Right?

301
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,500
(Right?)
Right?

302
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,670
(Nod nod)

303
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:38,820
-We sleep in the same bed.
-What's going on?
(Nod nod)

304
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,590
-We sleep in the same bed.
-What's going on?

305
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,000
What? What's going on between you two?

306
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,960
They were sweet yesterday.

307
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,210
Did they cuddle while sleeping?

308
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,380
I don't know. It's kind of sweet.

309
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:45,760
(Really?)
I don't know. It's kind of sweet.

310
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,780
(Really?)

311
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,780
(Have they grown close?)

312
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:51,460
I don't know. It's kind of sweet.

313
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,480
(Jeong-ho and Chan-gyu grow close overnight.)
I don't know. It's kind of sweet.

314
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,420
(Jeong-ho and Chan-gyu grow close overnight.)

315
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:55,420
I've finished eating.

316
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,810
(End of the breakfast during which they guessed what the special event is about.)
I've finished eating.

317
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:57,670
(End of the breakfast during which they guessed what the special event is about.)

318
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,170
I've finished, too.
(End of the breakfast during which they guessed what the special event is about.)

319
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,540
(End of the breakfast during which they guessed what the special event is about.)

320
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:12,100
(The men who have pushed curiosity from their minds are busy packing up.)

321
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,340
(The men in the quad room are also busy.)

322
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,980
(Tidy tidy)

323
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,460
(What is the special event awaiting the men?)

324
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,500
(Hyeon comes down first.)

325
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,870
There's another mission card.

326
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,140
What is it?

327
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,330
(What is it?)
What is it?

328
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,540
(What is it?)

329
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,580
(The new card says...)

330
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,630
What is that mission card about?
(The new card says...)

331
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,280
What?
(The new card says...)

332
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,200
A mission card?

333
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,100
(Curious)

334
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,300
(Serious)

335
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,940
Today is the day to exchange your rooms.

336
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,880
The person who wins the game

337
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,930
will have the right to first choose the room and his roommates.

338
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,850
Unleash your desire to win.

339
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,920
Go get the room and the roommates you want.

340
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,690
Wow.

341
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,450
Oh, no. We're gonna change our rooms.

342
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,420
It's time to change.

343
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,380
Yeah. It's time to change.

344
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,810
I don't want to change.

345
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,370
I don't want to part from Chang-min.

346
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:20,950
I sleep in the same bed with Jeong-ho.

347
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,770
We talked a lot before we went to sleep,

348
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,940
so I don't want to change my room.

349
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,300
Do you have a room you'd like to stay in?

350
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,360
Yes. I do.

351
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,080
Oh, really?

352
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,280
Hyeok-jun, where do you want to live?

353
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,820
I'd like to live in the double room.

354
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,630
With whom?

355
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,990
I like my current room.

356
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,390
I like my current room, too.

357
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,370
Just raise your hand if you like your current room.

358
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:40,740
Me.

359
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,230
(Me)
Me.

360
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:41,430
(Me)

361
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,120
Me, too.
(Me)

362
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,810
And me.
(Me)

363
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,980
Me, too.
(Me)

364
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,580
(Me)

365
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:44,660
Someone may not want to say.
(Me)

366
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,360
Someone may not want to say.

367
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,170
If we try and live in a different room,

368
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,010
we might think differently.

369
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:50,950
(What changes will the new room arrangement bring to the men?)

370
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,450
That's also what I think.
(What changes will the new room arrangement bring to the men?)

371
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:52,920
(What changes will the new room arrangement bring to the men?)

372
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,970
But how could they...
(What changes will the new room arrangement bring to the men?)

373
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,980
(What changes will the new room arrangement bring to the men?)

374
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,060
Let's go out.

375
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,780
-Let's go.
-Let's go out.

376
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,940
-Are we leaving?
-Yeah.

377
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,290
(What is the game awaiting the men?)

378
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,170
Let's go. Come on.
(What is the game awaiting the men?)

379
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,220
I was thinking

380
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:06,490
(I was thinking there might be some athletic activities.)
I was thinking

381
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,950
there might be some athletic activities.
(I was thinking there might be some athletic activities.)

382
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,300
(I was thinking there might be some athletic activities.)

383
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:17,420
("What changes will take place in Men's House?")

384
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,380
(The men left Men's House and went on a journey.)

385
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,120
Where are we going? We're not even using navigation.

386
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,350
I hope it's not an indoor event.

387
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,860
I have no idea where we are going.

388
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,760
It's not gonna be military training

389
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,140
all of a sudden after we get there, right?

390
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,510
If that's the case, I think Hyeon will do a great job.

391
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,680
He seems to be the one who will work hardest.

392
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,540
There's nothing I hate more than tiring things.

393
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:40,730
(Please)
There's nothing I hate more than tiring things.

394
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,030
You really hate those.
(Please)

395
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,820
(Please)

396
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,930
Which room do you want to live in if you win the game?

397
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,390
Me? Honestly, I want to live in the quad room.

398
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,050
In your current room?

399
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:51,830
With whom?

400
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,220
Still with my current roommates.

401
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:53,300
Really?

402
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,110
(Really?)
Really?

403
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:54,580
(Really?)

404
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:54,620
I feel I get along well with my current roommates.
(Really?)

405
00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:00,130
I feel I get along well with my current roommates.

406
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,190
(Nod nod)

407
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,190
Right?
(Nod nod)

408
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,330
I think it's great, too.

409
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:04,380
I got the single room.

410
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,320
(The first day)
I got the single room.

411
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,890
Wow!
(The first day)

412
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,730
(The first day)

413
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,830
I'm so jealous.
(The first day)

414
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,920
(The first day)

415
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,190
Oh, what a pity.
(The first day)

416
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,430
(The first day)

417
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,670
What? Why?
(The first day)

418
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,030
I wanted the single room.
(The first day)

419
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:14,630
(The first day)

420
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,370
I like living on my own.
(The first day)

421
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,020
(The first day)

422
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,160
(Jeong-hyeon often goes to the single room to hang out with Eun-chan.)

423
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,920
Why do you ask me that every time?
(Jeong-hyeon often goes to the single room to hang out with Eun-chan.)

424
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,600
What?
(Jeong-hyeon often goes to the single room to hang out with Eun-chan.)

425
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,610
Ask if I wake up.
(Jeong-hyeon often goes to the single room to hang out with Eun-chan.)

426
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,670
Out of politeness.
(Jeong-hyeon often goes to the single room to hang out with Eun-chan.)

427
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,720
Wow!

428
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,560
There is only one reason

429
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,760
that I want to stay in the quad room.

430
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,540
(The reason why Jeong-hyeon who wanted to live in the single room changed his mind is...)

431
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,950
I like hanging out with the people I like.

432
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,660
Me, too.

433
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,040
I often have mood swings.

434
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,520
When I'm in high spirits,

435
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,690
Chan-gyu who is quiet makes me comfortable.

436
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:53,600
That's why it feels really good to sleep in the same bed with Chan-gyu.

437
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,100
(Chan-gyu and Jeong-ho grow close after they share a bed.)

438
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,270
Brother, did you sleep well?

439
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:01,510
(Pat)

440
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,490
Did you sleep well?
(Pat)

441
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,380
(Pat)

442
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,270
First of all, two people can sleep in the same bed in the quad room.

443
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,800
It won't be boring.

444
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,370
Right.

445
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,640
I want to get the first place no matter what the game is.

446
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,380
Then you can stay in the single room?

447
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:14,600
(I don't know.)

448
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,100
I don't know.
(I don't know.)

449
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,580
(I don't know.)

450
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,040
Yeah, right.

451
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,100
You have to use your brain to get the first place.

452
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,760
What if...

453
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,110
I've almost made up my mind.

454
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,970
If you like someone,

455
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,560
I don't recommend you share a room with him.

456
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,630
After what I've said, if I take the last place,

457
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,730
it would make me sound ridiculous.

458
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,620
If I'm the last, I would say to the first, "please".

459
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,620
If I'm the first,

460
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:38,820
go home.

461
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,090
(Go home)
go home.

462
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,380
(Go home)

463
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,170
Your room is your home.

464
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,940
Go ahead.

465
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,010
(Go ahead)
Go ahead.

466
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,780
(Go ahead)

467
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,820
We seem to be in a sports park.

468
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,980
Sports park?

469
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,550
-Here's a racing park.
-Here.

470
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,580
Racing park?

471
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,420
(Go-kart Race that will determine the reallocation of the rooms.)

472
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:17,780
(Room Allocation Race Rule No. 1 Split up into two teams and race against each other. Only the first two of each team can reach the final.)

473
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:26,220
(Room Exchange Race Rule No. 1 The one who ranks top gets the priority to choose the room and roommates he wants.)

474
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,710
Look at the go-kart.

475
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,580

I thought I could drive well.

641
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,500
I wanted to win the race and pick the single room and then choose Chang-min.

642
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,930
There was no rule that two roommates couldn't share a single room, right?

00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,440
(Jeong-hyeon is the first.)
Jeong-hyeon is the first.

786
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,390
Really?
(Jeong-hyeon is the first.)

787
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,420
He leaves the other three behind.

788
00:25:59,420 --> 00:25:59,440
(Run, Lee Jeong-hyeon)
He leaves the other three behind.

789
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,750
Run, Lee Jeong-hyeon!
(Run, Lee Jeong-hyeon)

790
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,300
(Run, Lee Jeong-hyeon)

791
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,900
(At the same time, Hyeon, Eun-chan and Chang-min in the second row)

792
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,270
(Hello)
Hello.

793
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,060
(Relaxed)
(Hello)

794
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:07,260
(Hello)

795
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,060
Where are you from?
(Relaxed)

796

(Where are you from?)
Where are you from?

(Relaxed)

798
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,740
(In an instant, Chang-min overtakes the two and becomes the second.)

799
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,300
(The gap widens quickly)

800
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,310
(Watching with interest)

801
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,380
Chang-min overtook.
(Watching with interest)

802
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,190
Chang-min overtook.

803
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,620
(Chang-min is trying to catch up with Jeong-hyeon, who is in the first place now.)

804
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,700
Great!

805
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,640
(Now it's the last lap)
Great!

806
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,690
Come on.
(Now it's the last lap)

807
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,420
(Now it's the last lap)

808
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,860
(Jeong-hyeon enters the chasing range of Chang-min.)

809
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,830
(Tries to overtake on the straight after the turning)

810
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,240
He caught up.
(Tries to overtake on the straight after the turning)

811
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,100
(Tries to overtake on the straight after the turning)

812
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,690
How did he do that?
(Tries to overtake on the straight after the turning)

813
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,840
(Jeong-hyeon is about to be overtaken by Chang-min again.)

814
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,820
Ah, what's going on?
(Jeong-hyeon is about to be overtaken by Chang-min again.)

815
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:54,900
It's a little strange.

816
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,860
(It's a little strange.)
It's a little strange.

817
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,410
If it was someone else, I might have got angry.

818
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,480
But it was Chang-min, so it didn't matter.

819
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,010
On the contrary, I thought he was cool.

820
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,500
(Chang-min drives up in triumph.)

821
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,140
The first can choose the second as his roommate.

822
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:13,820
I've given up already.

823
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,070
(I've given up already.)
I've given up already.

824
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,740
(I've given up already.)

825
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,060
I don't care who wins.

826
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:20,280
(I don't care who wins.)
I don't care who wins.

827
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:20,820
(I don't care who wins.)

828
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,070
I don't care who wins. Just assign me a nice room.

829
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:29,540
(Chang-min shows his true colors and wins the champion of the final.)

830
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,130
Jeong-hyeon looked like he couldn't drive,

831
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:36,270
but he followed me closely all the time.

832
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,570
It was unexpected.

833
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,810
(2nd of the final Jeong-hyeon)

834
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:40,550
Would they think
(2nd of the final Jeong-hyeon)

835
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,750
I look cool while driving?

836
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,130
I was thinking of that.

837
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,530
I showed some kind of reversal charm.

838
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,020
Today's reversal is me, isn't it?

839
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,950
(Today's reversal is me, isn't it?)
Today's reversal is me, isn't it?

840
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,100
(Today's reversal is me, isn't it?)

841
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,820
(What a pity)

842
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,460
(3rd Hyeon)

843
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:00,140

(Chang-min enjoys the joy of winning the champion.)

847

I'm third in the end.
(Chang-min enjoys the joy of winning the champion.)

848
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,970
Yeah, the third.

Individual top speed of a lap.
(1st Chang-min 2nd Jeong-hyeon 3rd Hyeon 4th Eun-chan 5th Hyeok-jun 6th Jeong-ho 7th Seon-yul 8th Chan-gyu)

852
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,530
Shall we stand in this order?

853
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,130
From the first.

854
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:20,660
Why?

855
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:20,860
(The dissatisfied third)
Why?

856
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,100
I'm the last.
(The dissatisfied third)

857
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,360
Thanks.

858
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,590
Is this how the winner feels?

859
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,470
Is this the air the second breathes?

860
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,370
What a surprise! I thought you couldn't drive.

861
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,400
I like to pretend to be weak.

862

(Upper circle, middle circle, lower circle)

863

(Upper circle, middle circle, lower circle)

865
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,980
Anyway, nobody from the fourth down gets any options.

866
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,520
Really?

867
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:40,580
It's over from the second down.

(Which room and roommates will Chang-min choose?)

00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,290
I haven't received a call yet.

(The noisy double room that never lacks laughter?)

885

Seriously?
(The noisy double room that never lacks laughter?)

886
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,770
You scared me.
(The noisy double room that never lacks laughter?)

887
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,760
(Or the quad room which he grew affectionate to?)

All right.

One, two, three.

893
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:17,920
Hurry.

894
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,580
(First Chang-min double room Hyeok-jun)

I didn't expect that at all.

898
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,800
What does it mean?

899
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,010
Why did he have to choose me?

900
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,700
I also felt a little awkward.

901
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,620
But I was still very happy.

902
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:45,780
You are crying. Don't cry.

903
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,350
(You are crying. Don't cry.)
You are crying. Don't cry.

(Sad Sobbing)

907
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:53,340
No wonder he wanted to win so bad.

908
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,930
How did Chang-min and Hyeok-jun end up together in the double room?

909
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,410
It doesn't matter who would the next person choose.

910
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:00,620
I have no hope now.

911
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:05,060
(Hyeok-jun is taken. It's pointless for Eun-chan to choose the room now.)
I have no hope now.

912
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,010
I didn't expect that at all.

913
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:11,810
I thought Chang-min would choose the single room.

914
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,670
But instead, he chose the double room.

915
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,840
And he took Hyeok-jun with him.

916
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,840
I didn't expect he'd do that.

917
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,180
(The two have been feeling connected to each other since day one.)

918

(Now Seon-yul and Hyeok-jun have to separate.)

919
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,940
Chang-min and I have called each other before.

920
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,150
I thought the vibe between us was pretty good

921
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:36,240
before we started to choose rooms today.

922
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,570
But all of a sudden,

923
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:39,440
(Chang-min's choice is hard to take in.)

924

everything changed.

(Chang-min's choice is hard to take in.)

926
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,740
I was thinking, "What happened?"

927
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:43,860
Am I too mediocre today?

928
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,260

(Next is Jeong-hyeon's turn to choose his room.)
Me.

(Next is Jeong-hyeon's turn to choose his room.)

933
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,240
It's the single room.

934
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,470
Must be the quadruple room.

(Jeong-hyeon chose the single room.)
(Second Jeong-hyeon Single room)

936
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,330
It's my turn.
(Jeong-hyeon chose the single room.)
(Second Jeong-hyeon Single room)

937
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:06,860
(Hyeon chose the single room.)

938
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,090
I choose the single room too.
(Hyeon chose the single room.)

939
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,290
I choose the single room too.

940
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,680
The rest of you, go to the quadruple room.

941
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:12,980
I'm going to the single room.

942
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,060
(Eun-chan Jeong-ho Seon-yul Chan-gyu quadruple room)
I'm going to the single room.

943
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,030
(Eun-chan Jeong-ho Seon-yul Chan-gyu quadruple room)

944
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,200
Okay.
(Eun-chan Jeong-ho Seon-yul Chan-gyu quadruple room)

945
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,020
Yeah, I choose the single room.

946
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,180
(Pity)
Yeah, I choose the single room.

947
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,350
(Pity)

948
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:19,460
But Eun-chan has to go to the quadruple room after living in the single room.
(Pity)

949
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,290
But Eun-chan has to go to the quadruple room after living in the single room.

950
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,420
It would take some getting used to.

951
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,650
There's no other way.

952
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:25,940
Take your dresser with you.

953
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,380
(Take your dresser with you.)
Take your dresser with you.

954
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,830
(Hyeok-jun is still joking, not knowing Eun-chan's feelings.)

955
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:29,940
Yeah, you hated the single room, right?
(Hyeok-jun is still joking, not knowing Eun-chan's feelings.)

956
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,340
Yeah, you hated the single room, right?

957
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:32,380
(Nobody seems to understand why Eun-chan is sad.)
Yeah, you hated the single room, right?

958
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,200
That's true.
(Nobody seems to understand why Eun-chan is sad.)

959
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,390
(Nobody seems to understand why Eun-chan is sad.)

960
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:34,420
Eun-chan always says he's lonely.
(Nobody seems to understand why Eun-chan is sad.)

961
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,720
(Eun-chan always says he's lonely.)
Eun-chan always says he's lonely.

962
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,250
That's right. That's what I meant.
(Eun-chan always says he's lonely.)

963
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,610
Let's live happily in the quadruple room.

964
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:39,910
Let's live happily together.

965
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,100
Let's go.

966
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:40,730
(The room assignment game ended in chaos.)
Let's go.

967
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:41,790
It's been a fun day.
(The room assignment game ended in chaos.)

968
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,390
(The room assignment game ended in chaos.)

969
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,450
Let's get going.
(The room assignment game ended in chaos.)

970
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,700
(The room assignment game is over.)

971
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,160
That was fun.

972
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,760
The final game was fierce.

973
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,510
Everybody was trying to get ahead.

974
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,250
I thought Chang-min

975
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,430
would choose that one.

976
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:56,980
Jeong-hyeon?

977
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,660
Yeah, I thought he would choose him.

978
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,100
(Feeling the same)

979
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,910
(Sullen)

980
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:02,980
I felt really irritated.
(Sullen)

981
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,760
I felt really irritated.

982
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,260
How did Chang-min and Hyeok-jun end up together in the double room?

983
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,560
I can't say I don't care about it.

984
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,260
I was a little upset.

985
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,890
I tried not to show my feelings.

986
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,420
(The four men are silent in the other car.)

987
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,220
(Observing)

988
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:25,440
The guys at the back are tired.

989
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,400
They were just talking.

990
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,290
Maybe they are sleepy now.

991
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,180
(Taking a peek)

992
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:32,620
What are you doing?

993
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,430
(What are you doing?)
What are you doing?

994
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,020
(What are you doing?)

995
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,660
(Jeong-hyeon keeps silent after the room assignment.)

996
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,810
What are you doing, Jeong-hyeon?

997
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,210
(Glancing)

998
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:40,700
Jeong-hyeon is looking at his phone.
(Glancing)

999
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,460
Jeong-hyeon is looking at his phone.

1000
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,710
What are you doing, Jeong-hyeon?

1001
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,290
I'm dozy.

1002
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,500
(Totally unlike his usual self)

1003
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,500
(Jeong-ho keeps joking to break the ice.)

1004
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:52,540
I'm so tired.
(Jeong-ho keeps joking to break the ice.)

1005
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,450
I'm so tired.

1006
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:53,740
Sis is talking to you.

1007
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,900
(Sis is talking to you.)
Sis is talking to you.

1008
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,780
(Shh)

1009
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,850
Think about when you were crying,

1010
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,260
I was always with you.

1011
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,370
That's right.

1012
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,250
You were always bullying me, alright?

1013
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,750
He was staying with you.

1014
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,040
He was a little tired.

1015
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,470
He has his dream roommate,

1016
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,130
but he can't live with him.

1017
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,080
That's why he acted like that.

1018
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,940
(The subtle atmosphere among the men.)

1019
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,740
I don't know if it's just me.

1020
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,910
But it's awkward between Chang-min and me.

1021
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,210
I feel like Chang-min has feelings for Hyeok-jun.

1022
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,060
I feel a little…

1023
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,740
A little heartbroken.

1024
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,150
(A little heartbroken.)
A little heartbroken.

1025
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,460
(A little heartbroken.)

1026
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,460
(Men's House)

1027
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:41,500
Long day.
(Men's House)

1028
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,380
(Long day.)
Long day.
(Men's House)

1029
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,020
We're back.

1030
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,930
(The men who returned to Men's House.)
We're back.

1031
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,740
(The men who returned to Men's House.)

1032
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,980
(A glance)

1033
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,060
(Observing)

1034
00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:00,500
(After a shower, Jeong-hyeon is packing before leaving the quadruple room.)

1035
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,140
(Jeong-hyeon comes to Eun-chan's single room.)

1036
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,010
Can you fall asleep in the quadruple room?

1037
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,199
I have to.

1038
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:10,580
It's not a big deal.

1039
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:10,780
(Gave up)
It's not a big deal.

1040
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,900
(Gave up)

1041
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,340
I was so…

1042
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,280
Chang-min.

1043
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,230
Yeah.

1044
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,500
I'm so jealous.

1045
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:19,620
(Wait a minute)

1046
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,739
(Protecting their secrets)
(Wait a minute)

1047
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,050
What is it?

1048
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:27,179
We even called each other yesterday.

1049
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:30,239
Why did he change so easily?

1050
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,370
Yeah, you even talked to each other.

1051
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,909
Yeah.

1052
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:36,380
But he chose Hyeok-jun.

1053
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,690
He chose him out of the blue.

1054
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,920
Human mind is so difficult to understand.

1055
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,540
Yeah, it's so difficult.

1056
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,370
(It's so difficult.)
Yeah, it's so difficult.

1057
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,380
(It's so difficult.)

1058
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,139
(Jeong-ho & Chan-gyu are talking in the living room.)

1059
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,900
I thought we would keep living like this.

1060
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:53,310
I think it's fine even if

1061
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,920
we don't change rooms anymore.

1062
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,230
(Thinking)

1063
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,900
But there is a point to changing rooms.
(Thinking)

1064
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,970
But there is a point to changing rooms.

1065
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,980
Especially the single room.

1066
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,770
Isn't the quadruple room better?

1067
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,740
Or is the double room better?

1068
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,360
The double room is the best.

1069
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,870
Chang-min seems really smart.

1070
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,900
(The two men have a lot of thoughts after the room assignment.)

1071
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:16,540
(The men are taking their luggage to their new rooms.)

1072
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,150
(Jeong-hyeon is tidying up his things in the quadruple room.)

1073
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,030
Can it go through?
(Jeong-hyeon is tidying up his things in the quadruple room.)

(Stopped)

1076
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,330
It'd probably collapse.
(Stopped)

1077
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:26,940
The hanger is too high.
(Stopped)

1078
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,650
The hanger is too high.

1079
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:29,300
Turn and lower it a little.

1080
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,290
(Turn and lower it a little.)
Turn and lower it a little.

1081
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,620
(Turn and lower it a little.)

1082

(Bang)

1084
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,030
Can you help me lift it up, bro?

1085
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:57,020
(For some reason, so many obstacles awaited Jeong-hyeon on his way.)

1086

(Jeong-hyeon moves his luggage into the single room by himself.)

(Fighting.)

1092
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,140
You can lend a hand.
(Fighting.)

1093
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:08,420
You can lend a hand.

1094
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,290
(Still in the single room. Nothing changes.)
You can lend a hand.

1095
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:09,820
(Still in the single room. Nothing changes.)

1096
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,440
Do you need to move anything?
(Still in the single room. Nothing changes.)

1097
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,500
This is really like moving house, right?

1098
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:12,820
(These are all Chang-min's luggage.)
This is really like moving house, right?

1099
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,370
Yeah, like moving into a new place.
(These are all Chang-min's luggage.)

1100
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,250
Wait.

1101
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:16,780
Do you need my help?

1102
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,410
(His feelings get complicated after seeing Chang-min and Hyeok-jun together.)
Do you need my help?

1103
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,130
Wait. Wait a second.
(His feelings get complicated after seeing Chang-min and Hyeok-jun together.)

1104
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,880
Will it fall?
(His feelings get complicated after seeing Chang-min and Hyeok-jun together.)

1105
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:22,670
Do you have a lot to move?

1106
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,780
I already finished.

1107
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,400
All done?

1108
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,100
Yeah.

1109
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:31,380
(It's still awkward between the two.)

1110
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:34,980
How do I move this?

1111
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,070
(It feels like getting thrown out for some reason.)

1112
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:40,100
I had to move into the quadruple room with more people.
(It feels like getting thrown out for some reason.)

1113
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,440
I had to move into the quadruple room with more people.

1114
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,900
So,

1115
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:48,720
my feelings were complicated.

1116
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,580
I was a little irritated.

1117
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,440
Everybody finished moving out.

1118
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,540
Why are you still here?

1119
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:54,740
You…

1120
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,740
(Frustrated)
You…

1121
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,900
(Frustrated)

1122
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:57,140
Can you hurry up?

1123
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,580
(Jeong-hyeon & Hyeon. The owner of the single room is rushing him.)
(Can you hurry up?)
Can you hurry up?

1124
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,580
Someone new comes to take the room.
(Jeong-hyeon & Hyeon. The owner of the single room is rushing him.)

1125
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,020
(Someone new comes to take the room.)
(Jeong-hyeon & Hyeon. The owner of the single room is rushing him.)

1126
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:58,560
(Jeong-hyeon & Hyeon. The owner of the single room is rushing him.)

1127
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,730
This is not your room.
(Jeong-hyeon & Hyeon. The owner of the single room is rushing him.)

1128
00:36:59,580 --> 00:36:58,580
(Jeong-hyeon & Hyeon. The owner of the single room is rushing him.)

1129
00:37:01,020 --> 00:36:59,580
(Jeong-hyeon & Hyeon. The owner of the single room is rushing him.)

1130
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,130
Why do you keep driving me away?

1131
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,660
Be happy.

1132
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,520
Take care.

1133
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:09,940
Take care.

1134
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,730
(Somehow, it's difficult to take the steps.)
Take care.

1135
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:10,960
(Somehow, it's difficult to take the steps.)

1136
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,480
Let's go.
(Somehow, it's difficult to take the steps.)

1137
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,020
(Staring)
(Somehow, it's difficult to take the steps.)

1138
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:11,740
(Somehow, it's difficult to take the steps.)

1139
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,930
Wait.
(Somehow, it's difficult to take the steps.)

1140
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,020
(Somehow, it's difficult to take the steps.)

1141
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:12,770
(Somehow, it's difficult to take the steps.)

1142
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:15,380
You. Stop it.

1143
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,650
(You. Stop it.)
You. Stop it.

1144
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:17,820
(You. Stop it.)

1145
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:19,660
(Tidying up)

1146
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,700
My laundry.
(Tidying up)

1147
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,940
(Tidying up)

1148
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,290
I'll help you take the heavy one downstairs.

1149
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:26,620
Oh.

1150
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,350
(Oh)
Oh.

1151
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,300
That one is not heavy at all.
(Oh)

1152
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:28,660
That one is not heavy at all.

1153
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,120
(Looks like he's lifting the heaviest thing in the world.)
That one is not heavy at all.

1154
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,680
(Looks like he's lifting the heaviest thing in the world.)

1155
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,160
There's nothing in it.
(Looks like he's lifting the heaviest thing in the world.)

1156
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,200
Are you coming back to take the hanger?

1157
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,480
-I'll take all of it at once.
-This whole thing.

1158
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:37,980
It's empty inside, bro.

1159
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,940
(It's empty inside, bro.)
It's empty inside, bro.

1160
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,100
Hahaha.
(It's empty inside, bro.)

1161
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,460
(Hahaha)
Hahaha.
(It's empty inside, bro.)

1162
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,120
There are so many things here.

1163
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,660
Can I come here to play?

1164
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:47,920
(Wry smile)
Can I come here to play?

1165
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,860
(Wry smile)

1166
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:55,300
(There's silence between them.)

1167
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:01,180
(Hyeok-jun doesn't seem to notice Jeong-hyeon's frustration.
He's secretly observing him.)

1168
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:06,020
(Uncomfortable)

1169
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,080
Where do you want to sleep? Pick a bed.

1170
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,110
Me?

1171
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,150
You want this one, right?

1172
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,490
Was this one Seon-yul's bed?

1173
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:12,810
Yeah.

1174
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:13,980
Then I'll have this one.

1175
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,380
(Peeking)

1176
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,220
(Glancing)

1177
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,740
(Hyeok-jun helps Seon-yul move his things to the quadruple room.)

1178
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,450
Careful.
(Hyeok-jun helps Seon-yul move his things to the quadruple room.)

(Hyeok-jun helps Seon-yul move his things to the quadruple room.)

1181
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,830
Give me a hand.

1182
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:38,380
Thanks.

1183
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,630
(Thanks.)
Thanks.

1184
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,380
(Thanks.)

1185
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:52,460
(The three men with a subtle vibe passed by each other.)

1186

(Right behind)

1187
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,740
(Come on. Get moving.)
(Right behind)

1188
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:58,140
Come on. Get moving.
(Come on. Get moving.)

Come on. Get moving.

1191

(Still in the quadruple room. Nothing changes.)

1192
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,580
You need to keep it low.
(Still in the quadruple room. Nothing changes.)

1193
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,470
Or it can't get in.
(Still in the quadruple room. Nothing changes.)

1194
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,500
Here.

1195
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:03,510
(You don't need help?)
Here.

1196
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,460
(You don't need help?)

1197
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:20,460
(Chang-min is always observing Jeong-hyeon. Jeong-hyeon looks kind of cold.)

1198
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,590
How do you like your new room?

1199
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:23,660
Very nice.

1200
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,470

Very nice.

1201

A nice place?
(The quadruple room. Very nice.)

1202
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,640
I love it.

1203
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,170
Have you decided whom you'll share a bed with?

1204
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,930
Don't know. Haven't decided yet.

1205

(Sullen)
(Eun-chan moves to the quadruple room.)

1207
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,160
Why do you look devastated?

1208
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:43,460
It's so dark in here.

1209
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,590
(It's so dark in here.)
It's so dark in here.

(It's so dark in here.)

1211
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,380
Jeong-hyeon, can I go to your room to do my make-up?
(It's so dark in here.)

1212

Jeong-hyeon, can I go to your room to do my make-up?

1213

Um?

1214
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,630
I want to do my make-up in your room.

1215
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,020
Come with information.

(Chan-gyu Hyeon Seon-yul)

1219
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,680
Have you finished moving your things, bro?

1220
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,340
Yeah.

1221
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,930
Let's assign the beds when Jeong-ho is here.

1222
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,370
Let's have a talk.

1223
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,170
(Everybody finished changing rooms with complicated feelings.)

1224

This must be so delicious.
(Everybody finished changing rooms with complicated feelings.)

1225

(Everybody finished changing rooms with complicated feelings.)

1226
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:27,820
(Everybody is so tired. They ordered food delivery for dinner.)

1227
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,200
Yeah, it's good.

1228
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,030
Their deep-fried pork chop are really good.

1229
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,060
Deep-fried pork chop.

1230
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,540
-Yeah, it's delicious.
-Have some more.

(Casting about)

1233

You don't have chopsticks?

1234
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,300
I'm fine with a spoon.

1235
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,240
Do you need me to get you a pair, bro?

1236
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,000
No, it's okay.

1237
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,120
The spoon works fine.

1238
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,920
-Geez.
-It's really fine.

1239
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,130
(Jeong-hyeon looks cold but still looks after Chang-min.)

1240
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,920
Do we have chopsticks here?

00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,690
Thank you.

1243
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,620
I'm so moved.

1244
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,980
(The kindness cannot be overseen.)

1245
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:22,460
(Totally contrary to the earlier situation, the dinner is quiet.)

1246
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,900
I don't know if it's because everyone was tired.

1247
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,200
Or they were all thinking about something.

1248
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,480
They looked exhausted.

1249
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,160
But only they know the real reason.

1250
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,110
I felt it at once.

1251
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:38,120
I came here too late.

1252
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:38,500
There's something between them.

1253
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,610
(There's something between them.)
There's something between them.

1254
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,370
Like undercurrent.
(There's something between them.)

1255
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:45,130
Something must have happened.

1256
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:55,380
(What are the men thinking about?)

1257
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,620
(The night gets darker after dinner.)

1258
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:07,420
(Chan-gyu and Jeong-ho are doing the dishes after dinner.)

1259
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,690
You wash it with detergent, and I'll rinse.

1260
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:11,800
Thanks.

1261
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,550
Just like this morning.

1262
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:15,360
(This morning)

1263
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,140
Good morning.
(This morning)

1264
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:16,870
(This morning)

1265
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,140
What do you want to cook for breakfast?
(This morning)

1266
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,910
What do you want to cook for breakfast?

1267
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,220
I already decided.

1268
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,040
(Half-awake)
I already decided.

1269
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,950
What are you making?
(Half-awake)

1270
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:24,380
A toast, very simple.

1271
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:24,450
(Cute)
A toast, very simple.

1272
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:26,100
(Cute)

1273
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,100
(Chan-gyu and Jeong-ho were doing dishes this morning.)

1274
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,340
(The dish mates are also together tonight.)

1275
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,580
(Rapport)

1276
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,800
I didn't expect to have sushi here.

1277
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:39,820
Eh?

1278
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,240
(Eh?)
Eh?

1279
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:40,780
I didn't expect to have sushi here.
(Eh?)

1280
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,690
I didn't expect to have sushi here.

1281
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:42,970
Really? Why?

1282
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,930
Because I really like sushi.

1283
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,590
Really? Do you know that I suggested it?

1284
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:47,700
For real?

1285
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,510
(For real?)
For real?

1286
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:49,260
(For real?)

1287
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,910
They were asking what we want.

1288
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:53,140
And I said sushi.

1289
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,620
(Rinsing)

1290
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,930
(Rinsing)

1291
00:42:59,930 --> 00:42:59,980
Let's go assign the beds after we finish.
(Rinsing)

1292
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:03,400
Let's go assign the beds after we finish.

1293
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,220
Or should we rest for a while first?

1294
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:10,130
Will they suggest some activities?

1295
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:13,670
If they don't, we'll go assign the beds.

1296
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:19,290
But we did the dishes together and talked for a bit.

1297
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:21,720
Although Jeong-ho has only been here for a day,

1298
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:25,180
I feel like we've talked a lot.

1299
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,870
So I was pretty happy.

1300
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,100
(Does Chan-gyu have feelings for Jeong-ho?)

1301
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,650
When I gave him the flowers,

1302
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:39,270
he said he would put them in a nice vase.

1303
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:40,730
Now they all withered.

1304
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,860
(Jeong-ho gave Eun-chan flowers on the secret date.)

1305
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,190
For you.
(Jeong-ho gave Eun-chan flowers on the secret date.)

1306
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,140
(Jeong-ho gave Eun-chan flowers on the secret date.)

1307
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,460
(Moved)
(Jeong-ho gave Eun-chan flowers on the secret date.)

1308
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,340
(Jeong-ho gave Eun-chan flowers on the secret date.)

1309
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,140
(The flowers carried the memory of the first date of Eun-chan and Jeong-ho.)

1310
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,220
(They are withering on the floor.)

1311
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:56,160
He doesn't seem to have much interest in flowers anyway.

1312
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,080
They were just on the floor.

1313
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,810
I was a little mad.

1314
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,740
(Jeong-ho put the flowers in a vase on purpose.)

1315
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,220
(Hesitant to speak. Decided to say nothing in the end.)

1316
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:06,610
(Eun-chan is watching Jeong-ho putting the flowers in a vase.)

1317
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,150
I have to explain this one.
(Eun-chan is watching Jeong-ho putting the flowers in a vase.)

1318
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:11,370
I didn't mean to throw it away.

1319
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:16,740
(It gets awkward between the two men.)

1320
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,780
(What will happen to the four men in the quadruple room?)

1321
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,540
(His Man)

1322
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,180
(After the room assignment.)

1323
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,140
(Their feelings that cannot be conveyed.)

1324
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:26,580
Honestly, I thought we would make phone calls today.
(Their feelings that cannot be conveyed.)

1325
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,550
Honestly, I thought we would make phone calls today.

1326
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:31,050
But we didn't.

1327
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:32,960
I'm fine with it.

1328
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,610
Even though there's no phone call,

1329
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:38,090
I'm in the same room with the one I want to call.

1330
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,090
(Shy)

1331
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:40,140
To be honest, I feel lucky more than anything else.
(Shy)

1332
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,620
To be honest, I feel lucky more than anything else.

1333
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:45,030
It took me a lot of courage

1334
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,330
to make a call and talk.

1335
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:51,320
It's good that it turned out like this.

1336
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:52,700
If I had to make a call,

1337
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,960
I would probably call Jeong-ho,

1338
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,200
and talk some more with him.

1339
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,650
That's what I think.

1340
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,820
If I had the chance to make a phone call,

1341
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,670
I would probably call Hyeok-jun.

1342
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:04,660
I really miss you.

1343
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,540
(I really miss you.)
I really miss you.

1344
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,660
(I really miss you.)

1345
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:13,040
(Will they be able to express their feelings?)
