252
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,170

(Nod)

254

But, it's just two times four.

It's the born fate, without a generation gap at all.

00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,570
(Eun-chan: He threw a punch with words, right? Chang-min: It's normal.)
He threw a punch with words, right?

590
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,540
It's normal.
(Eun-chan: He threw a punch with words, right? Chang-min: It's normal.)

591
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,950
But I thought Hyeok-jun and Hyeon knew each other.

592
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,640
Why is that?

593
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:08,960
When they walked in...

594
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,080
(When they walked in... oh?! I saw it, too!

(When they walked in... oh?! I saw it, too!

596
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,220
Hyeok-jun smiled at Hyeon.

597
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,390
-I noticed your eye contact.
-So,

598
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,840
(Eun-chan: I noticed your eye contact.)
-I noticed your eye contact.
-So,

599
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,520
I was thinking, "What's going on? Do they know each other?"

600
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,270
(Jeong-hyeon: I was thinking, "What's going on? Do they know each other?")

602
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,390
Should I just sit here?

603
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,860
(The earlier situation Hyeon: Should I just sit here?)
Should I just sit here?

605
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,030
(Hyeok-jun brought slippers to Hyeon)

606
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,180
Thank you.
(Hyeok-jun brought slippers to Hyeon)

607
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,410
(Hyeok-jun brought slippers to Hyeon)

608
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,830
(Are they making eyes at each other?)

609
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,400
((What's going on here?))

610
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,190
I smiled just to fool you guys.

611
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,950
I could feel it.

612
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,790
That's why intuition can be scary.

613
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:46,590
I think I made eye contact with Hyeok-jun. Or maybe not?

614
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,700
(Hyeon: I think I made eye contact with Hyeok-jun. Or maybe not?)
I think I made eye contact with Hyeok-jun. Or maybe not?

615

(Hyeon: I think I made eye contact with Hyeok-jun. Or maybe not?)

616
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,700
(Is it the beginning of a love triangle or is it just a little misunderstanding?)

617
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,710
(Start to get cautious somehow)

618
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,600
((What's going on between the two of them?))

619
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,430
(Oh~~~)

620
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:03,780
(A dinner that is sometimes tense and sometimes friendly)

621
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,570
It's amazing.

Yeah, there are a lot of dishes to wash today.

628

(Men getting to know each other)

634
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,140
It would be awful if you fall.

635
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,480
Be careful, old man.

636
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:24,840
Did you just say old man?

637
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,000
(Hyeok-jun Angry: Did you just say old... old man? Seon-yul: Um, I'm scared.)

Two old men are going downstairs.

640
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,110
How are your knees?

641
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,240
(How are your knees? Haha)
How are your knees?

(The 14 years younger brother found it interesting to tease the seniors)

646

(Oh! Hold on)

It must be fun.

Aren't you curious about who you'll be sharing the room with?

670

Please choose one of the two cards

(Only 2 options!)

(Men are nervous before Hyeon makes a choice)

Is it possible that the rooms will be rearranged?

676

(Roommates Single room: Eun-chan; Double room: Seon-yul, Hyeok-jun; Triple room: Chang-min, Jeong-hyeon, Chan-gyu. Eun-chan: When was this done?)

737
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,400
When was this done?
(Roommates Single room: Eun-chan; Double room: Seon-yul, Hyeok-jun; Triple room: Chang-min, Jeong-hyeon, Chan-gyu. Eun-chan: When was this done?)

738
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,590
Impressive.

739
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,090
Pick a color you like.

740
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:47,500
(Single room: Hyeon. All the seven men have been assigned their rooms!)

741
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,640
It says roommates, but I don't have a roommate.

742
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,940
Me neither.

743
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,680
The triple room was almost turned into a room for four.

744
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,200
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

745
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,820
I'm a little shocked now.

746
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,990
Why?

747
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,250
It can actually be turned into a room for four.

748
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,260
Which means there might be one more man to come.

749
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,400
(Jeong-hyeon: Jesus...)

750
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,490
No more people, please.
(Jeong-hyeon: Jesus...)

751
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,030
No more people, please.

752
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,080
((Really?))

753
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,510
Let's go check the rooms.

754
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,420
Let's go.

755
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,250
Let me help you.

756
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,440
(What's going on? Proactive Chang-min)

757
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,410
Will there be enough hangers?

758
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,340
Not many.

759
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:27,970
Yeah?

760
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,360
I couldn't hang all my clothes, either.

761
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:32,250
Please come in.

762
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:32,860
(Chang-min Escort: Please go in)
Please come in.

763
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,950
(Chang-min Escort: Please go in)

764
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:37,660
-Sorry to bother you.
-Sorry to bother you.

765
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,720
(Chang-min: Sorry to bother you)
-Sorry to bother you.
-Sorry to bother you.

766
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,220
Is there also something?
(Chang-min: Sorry to bother you)

767
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:39,290
Is there also something?

768
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,070
(Hyeon: Oh? Is there also something?)
Is there also something?

769
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,740
(Hyeon: Oh? Is there also something?)

770
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,560
(Hyeon: Oh?)

771
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,490
What is it?

772
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,000
-What's wrong?
-What?

773
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,430
(Curious What? Hyeon: What's wrong?)
-What's wrong?
-What?

774
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,440
-What's wrong? Can I see it?
-No, no.
(Curious What? Hyeon: What's wrong?)
-What's wrong?
-What?

775
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:45,920
-What's wrong? Can I see it?
-No, no.

776
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,420
(Chang-min: Can I see it? Hyeon: No.)
-What's wrong? Can I see it?
-No, no.

777
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:47,590
(Hahaha Chang-min: Does it ask you to make a phone call?)

778
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,030
Does it ask you to make a phone call?
(Hahaha Chang-min: Does it ask you to make a phone call?)

779
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,620
It's the same.

780
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,480
Yeah?

781
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:51,490
(The phone special for Man's House)
Yeah?

782
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,330
(The phone special for Man's House)

783
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:52,640
What is this?
(The phone special for Man's House)

784
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,490
What is this?

785
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,140
You can unpack your luggage now, senior.

786
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:56,850
Okay, thank you.

787
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:57,630
Is there anything I can do for you?

788
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,320
No, it's okay.

789
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,820
I want to help.

790
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,290
(Chang-min left reluctantly)

791
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:07,330
(I have a lot of clothes. Haha)

792
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,890
I have a lot of clothes.
(I have a lot of clothes. Haha)

793
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,840
(I have a lot of clothes. Haha)

794
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,940
We need someone to wash the dishes and tidy them up, right?

795
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,120
Okay, I'll wash the dishes here.

796
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,120
(Eun-chan: I'll wash the dishes here.)
Okay, I'll wash the dishes here.

797
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,280
I'll put them here after I wash them, right?

798
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,480
Then Jeong-hyeon will put them back into place, right?

799
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,150
(Okay, got it)

800
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,100
Who did you go out with today?

801
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,100
Me and Hyeok-jun.

802
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,510
Hyeok-jun.

803
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,820
How was your date?

804
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,350
Very interesting.

805
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,590
-Really?
-Yeah.

806
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,580
But it's the first time I've ever done that.

807
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,250
A totally new experience for me, too.

808
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:45,860
Were you on a date with me?

809
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,510
(Made a joke all of a sudden Jeong-hyeon: Were you on a date with me?
Were you on a date with me?

810
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,610
I wonder who you are talking about.

811
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,610
That's mean.

812
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,210
Why did you choose Hyeok-jun anyway?

813
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:56,950
(Chang-min: But why did you choose Hyeok-jun as your date?
Why did you choose Hyeok-jun anyway?

814
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,110
(Hee hee Chang-min: Is there any special reason? Jeong-hyeon: Is it because he is charming?)

815
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,050
-Is there any special reason? -Is it because he is charming?
(Hee hee Chang-min: Is there any special reason? Jeong-hyeon: Is it because he is charming?)

816
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,660
-Are you entranced by him? -It was your first choice.

817
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,680
But I...

818
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:06,900
We were in the living room.

819
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,480
(Eun-chan: We were in the living room when we first met)
We were in the living room.

820
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:09,710

You and Hyeok-jun came in last.

822
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,480
Yeah.

823
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,020
In fact, I have only had eyes for Hyeok-jun since then.

824
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,290
-Really?
-Really?

825
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,340
(Surprised Really?)
-Really?
-Really?

826
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,230
From the beginning, the first impression.
(Surprised Really?)

833
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,760
Oh my God.
(Eun-chan honestly confesses his feelings for Hyeok-jun)

834
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,230
Did he hear it?

835
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,060
I think he heard it.

836
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:30,950
Did he hear it?

I think he heard it.

840
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,200
Did he hear it?

841
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,650
It was a declaration of war, actually.

842
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:42,940
Eun-chan has an American mentality.

843

(Chang-min: Eun-chan has an American mentality. He is honest and brave)

(Chang-min: To be honest, I didn't know you would answer)
-To be honest, I didn't know you would answer.
-Me?

848
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,660
I asked you because I thought you wouldn't answer.

849
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:57,170
But I don't hide my personality and emotions.

850
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,160
You're so American.

851

00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,020
Looks like my room is adjoining the common areas.

890
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,280
You scared me!

891
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:13,860
(Ah! You scared me!)
You scared me!

892
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,780
What's going on? What's going on?
(Ah! You scared me!)

893
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,150
What's going on? What's going on?

894
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,600
(A head popping up)

895

Looks like my room is adjoining the common areas.

896
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,420
What's going on?

897
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:22,460
(We have to be careful about what we say)
What's going on?

898
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,780
-We have to be careful about what we say.
-Yeah.
(We have to be careful about what we say)

899
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,100

901
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,320
(Ha ha ha)

902
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,750
(Eun-chan cares that Hyeok-jun and Hyeon are having a good time)

903
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,630
((What happened?))

904
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,590
(Nervous 0% Different from other men, Hyeok looks relaxed)

905
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,880
(Hyeok, please go to the telephone booth
and tell your feelings to the man you like in 30 seconds)

906
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,700
(Hyeon left without hesitation)

907
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:59,620
(Rustling Eun-chan heard the sound and reacted immediately)

908
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:09,470
(Which man is Hyeok thinking of?)

909
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:16,060
I like someone with the looks of both a desert fox and a bear.

910
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:20,910
I like someone thoughtful and considerate.

911
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,440
(Who is the man Hyeok wants to express his feelings to without hesitation?)

912

(The phone is ringing somewhere)

913
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:49,130
(Who received the call from Hyeok?)

914
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:57,570
(What would the new man, Hyeok, say to that man?)

915
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:06,640
(Men's House is calmer than usual in the morning probably because of the rain)

916
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,590
(Man in the single room is dressing up diligently)

917

(Hyeok is still sleeping)

921
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,150
We should wake Hyeok up.

922
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:31,160
(Hyeok-jun: We should wake Hyeok up...)
We should wake Hyeok up.

923
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,500
Hyeok said he won't wear makeup.

924

(Hyeok-jun: Really...?

927
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,210
It should be fine.

(A head popping up)

932
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,300
(Finally, Hyeok-jun comes to wake Hyeon up)

933
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,620
Time to get up.

934
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,920
Tidy up.

935
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,460
Hurry.

936
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:58,540
Five more minutes. Give me five more minutes.

937
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,230
(Hey yo)

938

(Cares about them)
All right, I got it.

(Hyeon also gets up with Hyeok-jun's help)

945

Are you not going to wash up?
(Hyeon also gets up with Hyeok-jun's help)

946
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,230
Wash up? Do I have to?

947
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,740
(Washed his face in the morning)

948
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,880

(Men coming downstairs to the kitchen)

959
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:38,190

What will we do today?

971
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,300
I'm curious.

972
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,580
Is there anything you want to do?

973
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:01,510
I want to rest because of the rain.

974
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,290
You've only been here for one day.

980
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,330
Are you the only one who made a call yesterday?

981
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,150
-No. -No?

982

Who made a call, then?

984
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,980
I heard someone passed out in the phone booth yesterday because he was too anxious.

985
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,070
Really?

986

(Passed out)
Passed out because he was too anxious.

988
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,400
Because of elevated blood pressure.

989
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,030
When he was waiting.

990
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:30,110
-He couldn't wait for his turn.
-Really?

991

-Exactly.
-No.

995
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:43,420
No one made a call, but someone got a call.

996
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:43,860
Did you get it?

997

1000
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,750
(Is he calling Chang-min, who volunteered to help him?)

1001
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:01,360
(Or Hyeok-jun who made eye contact with him at dinner?)

1002
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,670

Who are you?

1007
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,239
It's a secret.

1008
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,370
Which floor do you live on?

1009
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:25,989
Guess which floor I live on.

1010
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,290

-Please speak a little louder.

(Shy)

1024
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,600
Who are you?

1025
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,020
It's a secret.

1026
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,350

Guess which floor I live on.

1028
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,960
Which floor do you live on?

1029
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,560
(Snap)

1030
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,960
(Confused Hyeok-jun: He said, "Guess which floor I live on.")

1031

He said "Guess which floor I live on."
(Confused Hyeok-jun: He said, "Guess which floor I live on.")

1032
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,010
((Curious))

1033
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,320
I can't guess who it is.

1034
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,500
I can't guess who it is.

1035
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,040
I'm not good at this.

1036
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,270
Because I'm shy.

1037
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,450
(Hyeon hung up the phone probably out of shyness)

1038
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:39,930
The first person who came to my mind was

1039

(Hyeon: The first person who came to my mind was)
The first person who came to my mind was

00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,520
He is closer to my type.

1042
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:46,790
It feels good.

1043
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,520
(It feels good...)
It feels good.

1044
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,990
(It feels good...)

1045
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,690
(Running away)

1046
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:55,720
(Eun-chan is watching the situation)

1047
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,380
(Quietly Eun-chan: No way... maybe my intuition is wrong)

1048
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,920
No way... maybe my intuition is wrong.
(Quietly Eun-chan: No way... maybe my intuition is wrong)

1049
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,230
I don't have to listen to the sounds.

1050
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,580
(Eun-chan: I don't have to listen to the sounds. The double room got a call...)
I don't have to listen to the sounds.

1051
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,580
That room got a call.
(Eun-chan: I don't have to listen to the sounds. The double room got a call...)

1052
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,090
(Eun-chan's mind is racing)

1053
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:05,970
There is no doubt about that.
(Eun-chan's mind is racing)

1054
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:10,400
(Eun-chan's mind is racing)

1055
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:13,850
Here it comes.

1056
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,330
What's the message?

1057
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,610
(Eh? Is the phone time over today?)

1058
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,390
Don't we need to call?
(Eh? Is the phone time over today?)

1059
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:20,880
(Eh? Is the phone time over today?)

1060
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,060
It says the time's over.
(Eh? Is the phone time over today?)

1061
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,000
What?
(Eh? Is the phone time over today?)

1062
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,540
(Eh? Is the phone time over today?)

1063
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,620
Don't we need to call?

1064
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,490
(Stunned)

1065
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,220
What?

1066
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,590
((What?) The phone time is over today.)

1067
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,240
What?
((What?) The phone time is over today.)

1068
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,730
((What?) The phone time is over today.)

1069
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:37,820
What's going on?
((What?) The phone time is over today.)

1070
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,050
What's going on?

1071
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:38,820
(What?)
What's going on?

1072
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:38,900
Did they forget us and just end it?
(What?)
What's going on?

1073
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,820
Did they forget us and just end it?

1074
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,670
I don't know. I think...

1075
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,410
(Shattered)
I don't know. I think...

1076
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,570
I've been filled with anxiety.

1077
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:56,420
(Stiff. Today's phone time is over.)

1078
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,090
Didn't we have a date today? I thought...

1079
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,490
(Eun-chan: Didn't we have a date today?)
Didn't we have a date today? I thought...

1080
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,080
Turns out the sun shines again after rain.
(Eun-chan: Didn't we have a date today?)

1081
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,990
Turns out the sun shines again after rain.

1082
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,190
I thought that was why I suffered yesterday.

1083
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,680
(Eun-chan: I thought 'that was why I suffered (mentally) yesterday'.)
I thought that was why I suffered yesterday.

1084
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,230
I thought that was why I suffered yesterday.

1085
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,230
Another test is coming.

1086
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:14,300
I really didn't expect the change.

1087
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,850
First of all, I won't give in.

1088
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:18,040
Though I'll be polite,

1089
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,570
I won't let him be stolen.

1090
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:24,000
I'm ready for a war.

1091
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:32,880
(The relationship between the three men is getting more and more complicated.)

1092
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,570
(And the card on the table in the living room)

1093
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,610
The task card is turned over now.

1094
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,670
Shall we check it now?

1095
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,020
I'll go and have a look first.

1096
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,650
Let's look at it together.

1097
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:46,130
Let's look at it together.

1098
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,170
Yes.

1099
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,510
I want to look at it too.

1100
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:48,750
(Surprised Jeong-hyeon: What's it? What? What's it?)
I want to look at it too.

1101
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,890
-What's it?
-I'm curious.
(Surprised Jeong-hyeon: What's it? What? What's it?)

1102
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,330
What? What's wrong? What's it?
(Surprised Jeong-hyeon: What's it? What? What's it?)

1103
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,730
Let us have a look.

1104
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:53,090
-Why are you running away?
-Wait.

1105
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,110
(Why run away! Ha-ha.)
-Why are you running away?
-Wait.

1106
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:54,140
Let me read it.
(Why run away! Ha-ha.)
-Why are you running away?
-Wait.

1107
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,240
Let me read it.

1108
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,240
I'm curious.

1109
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:03,190
Today, only Hyeon, the new guest, has the right to ask for a date.

1110
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,270
I knew it.

1111
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,930
From now on, in 30 minutes,

1112
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:10,100
express your feelings to the one you want to spend time with.

1113
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,020
In 30 minutes.

1114
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:11,940
Let's see who he'll choose.

1115
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,150
In 30 minutes.

1116
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,210
30 minutes is enough.

1117
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,130
What about the rest of us?

1118
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,290
That's the only information on the card?

1119
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,070
What?

1120
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:19,160
(Eun-chan becomes gloomy after reading the card)
What?

1121
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,230
Is that all?
(Eun-chan becomes gloomy after reading the card)

1122
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:20,870
Yes.
(Eun-chan becomes gloomy after reading the card)

1123
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,870
So only one couple has a date today.

1124
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:25,040
Only one couple?

1125
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,680
Why, how come?

1126
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,800
So romantic.

1127
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:28,980
Won't he choose who he likes?

1128
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,320
(Check Eun-chan: Won't he choose who he likes?)
Won't he choose who he likes?

1129
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,510
That is the way.

1130
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:31,710
Has he chosen someone already?

1131
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,340
(Has he chosen someone already~? Ha-ha.)
Has he chosen someone already?

1132
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,060
Has he chosen someone already?

1133
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:37,660
Maybe he would ask the man he called yesterday for a date.

1134
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,220
(Eun-chan has a sense of foreboding?)

1135
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,500
(Who will Hyeon ask for a date?)

1136
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:48,150
(Today, only Hyeon, the new guest, has the right to ask for a date.
From now on, in 30 minutes, express your feelings to the one
you want to spend time with. )

1137
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,360
((Troubled))

1138
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,770
(Men waiting for Hyeon's date invitation in their rooms)

1139
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,170
You seem to like that.
(Men waiting for Hyeon's date invitation in their rooms)

1140
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:01,970
(Men waiting for Hyeon's date invitation in their rooms)

1141
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,010
(Complicated...)

1142
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:08,920
(Unhurriedly Unhurriedly)

1143
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,120
(Hyeon comes to the double room)

1144
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:11,930
What?

1145
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,290
Who is it?

1146
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,690
It's me.

1147
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,630
Why don't you go on the date?

1148
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,060
Yeah, why don't you go?

1149
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:17,130
What? -Don't you go on the date?

1150
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:17,810
(Hyeon: What?)
What? -Don't you go on the date?

1151
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:18,750
(What? Seon-yul: (Is the one you want to date with) Here?)
Right here?

1152
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:19,700
-What?
-Here?
(What? Seon-yul: (Is the one you want to date with) Here?)

1153
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,070
It's a secret.

1154
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:21,860
Have you sent it out?

1155
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:21,870
(Hyeon: (The date invitation) Hasn't been sent out yet. Hyeok-jun: Not yet?)
Have you sent it out?

1156
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,800
Not yet?
(Hyeon: (The date invitation) Hasn't been sent out yet. Hyeok-jun: Not yet?)

1157
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,730
You haven't sent it out?
(Hyeon: (The date invitation) Hasn't been sent out yet. Hyeok-jun: Not yet?)

1158
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:24,250
Yeah.
(Hyeon: (The date invitation) Hasn't been sent out yet. Hyeok-jun: Not yet?)

1159
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,280
Yeah.

1160
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,210
What should I do? This is the only thought I have in mind.

1161
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:32,910
How am I going to say it? I'm bashful.

1162
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:42,040
(Hyeon has been wandering about the double room)

1163
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,690
Like taking care of others...

1164
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:45,700
(Popping head)
Like taking care of others...

1165
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,900
(Popping head)

1166
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,920
((Drawing back first...))

1167
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,240
(Upset)

1168
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,380
(Upset again)

1169
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:00,070
(Hyeon hides out of shyness)

1170
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,290
(Just then, Seon-yul leaves the room)

1171
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,190
((Is he gone?))

1172
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:11,320
(Shy. Hyeon: What do you say we have a date later...)

1173
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,150
What do you say we have a date later?
(Shy. Hyeon: What do you say we have a date later...)

1174
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:16,030
(Hyeon's first choice is Hyeok-jun)

1175
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:16,790
OK.
(Hyeon's first choice is Hyeok-jun)

1176
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,160
(Hyeon's first choice is Hyeok-jun)

1177
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,400
I want to thank him.

1178
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,500
Anyway,

1179
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,520
I chose him according to my first impression.

1180
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,890
Generally speaking, he's my favorite type.

1181
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:31,300
I like his appearance.

1182
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,690
And I like those older than me.

1183
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:36,270
So I'm attracted to him.

1184
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:53,260
((Secret date?) Someone asked Eun-chan out on a secret date.)

1185
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,310
(Who is it?)

1186
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:01,240
(At the same time, Hyeon and Hyeok-jun are going on their date.)

1187
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,200
(Hyeok-jun: Where are we going? Hyeon: I don't know.)

1188
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,250
So I'm attracted to him.
(Hyeok-jun: Where are we going? Hyeon: I don't know.)

1189
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,130
Where are we going?
(Hyeok-jun: Where are we going? Hyeon: I don't know.)

1190
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,280
I went to bed late last night.

1191
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,300
(What would they do on their first date?)
I went to bed late last night.

1192
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:10,540
(What would they do on their first date?)

1193
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,470
Yeah.
(What would they do on their first date?)

1194
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:11,930
(What would they do on their first date?)

1195
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,290
I got up late too.
(What would they do on their first date?)

1196
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:14,120
(What would they do on their first date?)

1197
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,870
Went to bed late and got up late.
(What would they do on their first date?)

1198
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:16,840
Went to bed late and got up late.

1199
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,650
(Eun-chan is also going out for his secret date.)

1200
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:30,330
(Carefully quietly)

1201
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,850
(Whoosh-)

1202
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:40,070
(Who asked Eun-chan out on a secret date?)

1203
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:43,890
Don't you think the weather is ambiguous?

1204
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,890
Where are we heading to?

1205
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:47,050
Jongno-gu? Or maybe Ikseon-dong.

1206
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:49,420
(Hyeon: Jongno-gu? Or maybe Ikseon-dong.)
Jongno-gu? Or maybe Ikseon-dong.

1207
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:49,440
Ikseon-dong?
(Hyeon: Jongno-gu? Or maybe Ikseon-dong.)
Jongno-gu? Or maybe Ikseon-dong.

1208
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,780
Ikseon-dong?

1209
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:50,910
Are we going somewhere beautiful?

1210
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,760
(Hyeon: It's a date. Are we going somewhere beautiful?)
Are we going somewhere beautiful?

1211
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:52,780
Ikseon-dong is nice.
(Hyeon: It's a date. Are we going somewhere beautiful?)
Are we going somewhere beautiful?

1212
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,760
Ikseon-dong is nice.

1213
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,450
I thought it was a long way. Where is it?

1214
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:01,480
Is it a place with water? Maybe Incheon?

1215
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,820
Or some kind of place like Outlets?

1216
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:05,170
I have no idea.

1217
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,360
(Hyeok-jun: (Where are we going?)I have no idea.)
I have no idea.

1218
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,550
(Hyeok-jun: (Where are we going?)I have no idea.)

1219
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,370
Why did you eat so little last night?

1220
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,440
You mean dinner?

1221
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,570
Maybe I was too nervous.

1222
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:18,710
Under that temperature and atmosphere,

1223
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,710
the atmosphere of dining,

1224
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:26,250
it was hard to eat while having a conversation during the first meeting.

1225
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,250
(Feeling the same)

1226
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,370
I'm pretty good at waking people up, right?

1227
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,760
You don't remember it, do you?

1228
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,480
I do.

1229
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,160
Do you?

1230
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:34,270
(Shy)
Do you?

1231
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:35,210
You remember the first time I woke up?
(Shy)

1232
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:36,330
Yeah.
(Shy)

1233
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,170
I prefer night to day.

1234
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,460
Me too. I also prefer night.

1235
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,590
(Me too!)
Me too. I also prefer night.

1236
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:41,920
Me too. I also prefer night.

1237
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,700
(The two are looking for things in common)
Me too. I also prefer night.

1238
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,060
I prefer night.
(The two are looking for things in common)

1239
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:44,560
(The two are looking for things in common)

1240
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,950
Across the bridge, there is Daebudo.

1241
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,950
It looks like we're going to Daebudo.

1242
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,100
Daebudo?

1243
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,400
Are we going to eat sashimi?

1244
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:58,710
(Hyeok-jun: Oh!? Hyeon: It's so beautiful.)

1245
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,040
It's so beautiful.
(Hyeok-jun: Oh!? Hyeon: It's so beautiful.)

1246
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,510
(Hyeok-jun: Oh!? Hyeon: It's so beautiful.)

1247
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:01,880
(Seeing the sea, the two expect more.)

1248
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,710
I thought we were going to play on the mudbank.
(Seeing the sea, the two expect more.)

1249
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:05,630
(Seeing the sea, the two expect more.)

1250
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:05,640
Seeing the mudbank, I thought we were either going to play on the mudbank or,
(Seeing the sea, the two expect more.)

1251
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:10,790
Seeing the mudbank, I thought we were either going to play on the mudbank or,

1252
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:14,930
maybe go fishing?

1253
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:17,430
But suddenly, we walked up the hill.

1254
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:17,510
(Where are Hyeok-jun and Hyeon going?)
But suddenly, we walked up the hill.

1255
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:18,630
So what will it be?
(Where are Hyeok-jun and Hyeon going?)

1256
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,760
(Where are Hyeok-jun and Hyeon going?)

1257
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,890
Kind of looking forward to it.
(Where are Hyeok-jun and Hyeon going?)

1258
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,150
I'm nervous and excited.

1259
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:25,150
Kind of nervous.

1260
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,660
Seriously? Could it be this?

1261
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,670
Are we going up?

1262
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:36,040
(A dating place hidden in deep mountains and forests?)

1263
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,010
Really!
(A dating place hidden in deep mountains and forests?)

1264
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:39,900
-Be careful.
-Yeah.
(A dating place hidden in deep mountains and forests?)

1265
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,420
(A dating place hidden in deep mountains and forests?)

1266
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:43,260
It looks like paragliding.

1267
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,370
Really?

1268
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,370
Oh, no.

1269
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:50,840
It really is. Well, wow, what should I do?

1270
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,590
(Really? Hyeok-jun: Paragliding, it really is. Well, wow, what should I do?)
It really is. Well, wow, what should I do?

1271
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,080
Really?
(Really? Hyeok-jun: Paragliding, it really is. Well, wow, what should I do?)

1272
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:55,640
(Really? Hyeok-jun: Paragliding, it really is. Well, wow, what should I do?)

1273
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,260
(Having tramped over mountains and through the sea, the two arrive at the date place)

1274
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,250
I think it's for real. There are helmets.

1275
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,930
Good one. What should I do?

1276
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:07,000
Can you paraglide?

1277
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,760
(Hyeok-jun: (Scary thing) Can you paraglide? Hyeon: Yeah, I want to.)
Can you paraglide?

1278
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,210
Yeah, I want to.
(Hyeok-jun: (Scary thing) Can you paraglide? Hyeon: Yeah, I want to.)

1279
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:10,360
-Really? -Yes.
(Hyeok-jun: (Scary thing) Can you paraglide? Hyeon: Yeah, I want to.)

1280
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:10,870
-Really? -Yes.

1281
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:12,990
(Hyeok-jun takes Hyeon's hand to feel his heart. Hyeok-jun: Feel my heart.)

1282
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:15,100
Feel my heart.
(Hyeok-jun takes Hyeon's hand to feel his heart. Hyeok-jun: Feel my heart.)

1283
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,590
(Hyeok-jun takes Hyeon's hand to feel his heart. Hyeok-jun: Feel my heart.)

1284
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,130
My heart is pounding.

1285
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,960
Really. It's for real.

1286
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,800
I'm scared. I'm screwed.

1287
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:28,800
Awesome.

1288
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:34,420
(Endless sea and mountains)

1289
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,760
Kind of nervous.

1290
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:46,700
(Paragliding makes them feel excited and nervous)

1291
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,120
So beautiful!
(Paragliding makes them feel excited and nervous)

1292
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:47,800
So beautiful!

1293
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,070
It really is. It feels good just seeing the scenery.

1294
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:50,140
(A special first date for them)
It really is. It feels good just seeing the scenery.

1295
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,270
(A special first date for them)

1296
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:52,350
-Welcome. Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

1297
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:55,170
(Welcome. Nice to meet you.)
-Welcome. Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

1298
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,910
This is the place for paragliding.

1299
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:00,290
Today you'll experience paragliding.

1300
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:01,650
-Really?
-Yeah.

1301
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,720
(Nervous Worried Half-excited and half-nervous Hyeon and Hyeok-jun)

1302
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,210
What should I do?
(Nervous Worried Half-excited and half-nervous Hyeon and Hyeok-jun)

1303
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:07,750
What should I do?

(Nervous Worried Half-excited and half-nervous Hyeon and Hyeok-jun)

How do you feel?
(Nervous Worried Half-excited and half-nervous Hyeon and Hyeok-jun)

1306
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:10,430
It's scary.
(Nervous Worried Half-excited and half-nervous Hyeon and Hyeok-jun)

1307
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,440
Don't lie to me.

1308
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,580
I'm a little nervous.

1309
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,450
I've never tried it before.

1310
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:15,920
I've never tried it, either.

1311
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:20,700
Are we going to jump down from here?

1312
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:25,980
I think we will have fun.

1313
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,390
The other guys don't get to experience it.

1314
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:31,250
I'm so excited.

1315
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:32,670
Excited?

1316
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:33,120
(Embarrassed excited)

1317
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,500
I'm looking forward to it.

(Embarrassed excited)

1319
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,050
Now everything is ready.

1320
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:39,860
You just need to practice one thing.

1321
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:39,950
((I... I'm going first?))
You just need to practice one thing.

1322
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:40,610
OK. OK.
((I... I'm going first?))

1323
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,440
Look to the right. Just one.
((I... I'm going first?))

(Worried Frightened)

1325
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,250
You must run.
(Worried Frightened)

1326
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:44,860
What should I do?
(Worried Frightened)

1327
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:45,080
(Both worried)
What should I do?
(Worried Frightened)

1328
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,370
Change your position because we need to take a video.
(Both worried)

1329
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:46,960
Change your position because we need to take a video.

1330
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,260
Don't pull me too hard. I'm frightened.

1331
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,550
I'll hold you tight. See the villa over there?

1332
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:50,580
Yeah.

1333
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,070

Shall I run that way?
(Flight direction)

1337
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,530
One, two, three, run!

1338
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:56,310
Run like this? I dare not!

1339
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:57,520
(Dare not run)
Run like this? I dare not!

1340
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:58,870
I dare, dare not run.

1341

1358
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:17,790
Then we can fly.

1359
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:17,860
-It's terrifying.
-It's OK. It's all right.

00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,600
(Hyeon: I'm too scared)
-It's terrifying.
-It's OK. It's all right.

1361
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:20,020
Where is your confidence?

1362
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,550
(Hyeok-jun: Where is your confidence?)
Where is your confidence?

1363
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:22,470
You should have a try.

1364
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,370
Have a try.

1365
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:28,150
Have a try. I really can't do it.

1366
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:31,240
Walk slowly. OK. Run.

1367
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:31,650

00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:35,910
Tell your friend you're leaving first.

1372
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:37,540
(What to do now...)
Tell your friend you're leaving first.

1373
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,600
Bye.

(Hyeok-jun musters up his courage and flies towards the sky)

1401

Really? What to do?

1437
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,720
I have to walk barefoot.

1438
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,960
Really? While you were running?

1439
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,280
Yeah, while I was running. I might run too hard.

1440
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:02,030
(Make sure the safety of each other(?) Both take off their outfits)

1441

(Affectionate)
Is my hair flattened? It flops over.

1454

Yes.

1456
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,540
The hair gel works well.

1457

He's kinder than I thought.

1458
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,150
I felt he might be of picky character.

1459

(Hyeon: Felt (Hyeok-jun) might be of picky character.)

00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:40,660
(The sport-type date comes to an end)

1465

Yes.

1475

The mist seems to rise suddenly.

1476
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:17,480
It was sunny just now. It was good.

1477
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:22,770
Fortunately, we went paragliding earlier.

1478

Tell me how you feel today.

The first time.

1486

Yeah, right.

1488
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,590
What's your first impression of me?

1489
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:45,070
First impression?

1490
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:47,310
(Hyeon: (First impression) quite good)

1491
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,770
Quite good.
(Hyeon: (First impression) quite good)

1492
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:49,030
Quite good, really.

1493
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:49,750
("Because it's quite good...")
Quite good, really.

1494
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,640
But, well, how shall I put it?
("Because it's quite good...")

1495
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,220
But, well, how shall I put it?

1496
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,120
We haven't talked about it yet, right?

1497
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,200
(Hyeok-jun: Haven't talked (with others) yet, right?)
We haven't talked about it yet, right?

1498
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:55,960
You mean us?
(Hyeok-jun: Haven't talked (with others) yet, right?)

1499
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,190
No, the...

1500
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:57,500
I haven't talked a lot with others.

1501
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,720
(Hyeon: I haven't talked a lot with others.)
I haven't talked a lot with others.

1502
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,180
(Hyeon: I haven't talked a lot with others.)

1503
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:02,990
Who do you want to talk with?

1504
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,350
Am I not talking with him now?

1505
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:06,710
No. No.

1506
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,400
Of course. Well, I,

1507
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:14,900
besides me, who else do you want to talk with?

1508
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:18,980
(Hyeok-jun: Besides me, who else do you want to talk with?)
besides me, who else do you want to talk with?

1509
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:19,570
(Hyeok-jun: Besides me, who else do you want to talk with?)

1510
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:23,300
It's a secret.

1511
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,520
Tell me. I'm curious.

1512
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:27,210
-Secret.
-Is it a secret?

1513
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:29,120
(Hyeon: Secret.)
-Secret.
-Is it a secret?

1514
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:32,240
I just wanted to make him jealous.

1515
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,550
I wanted him to think of all the possibilities.

1516
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,910
So I said that.

1517
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:39,890
I see.

1518
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,700
(Hesitating)

1519
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:47,900
If you're making the call tonight, will you call?

1520
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:52,850
(Hyeon: If you're making the call tonight, will you call (me)?)
If you're making the call tonight, will you call?

1521
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:53,500
If you're making the call tonight, will you call?

1522
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,470
Call you?

1523
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:55,400
Yes.

1524
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,790
(Anticipating)

1525
00:51:59,380 --> 00:51:59,590
It depends on what you do.

1526
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:00,350
(Ah... It depends on what you do)
It depends on what you do.

1527
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:01,940
Oh, OK. OK.
(Ah... It depends on what you do)

1528
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:03,710
-I was joking.
-No. No.

1529
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:05,260
(Joking)
-I was joking.
-No. No.

1530
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,570
Joking.
(Joking)

1531
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:09,450
It's my secret too.

1532
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:17,420
(Not fully understand the delicate affection between the two men)

1533
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:17,860
Go. Go. Go.

1534
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,170
(Go! Go!)
Go. Go. Go.

1535
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:19,770
Go. Go. Go.

1536
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:20,860
Go. Go. Go.

1537
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:26,250
I thought Hyeon was kind of naughty.

1538
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:32,970
But I became to like him after we spent some time together.

1539
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:38,070
I'm easily moved by small things,

1540
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,460
like opening the door for me.

1541
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,270
Some trivial things he did

1542
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:45,320
just moved me.

1543
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,270
(Moved)
just moved me.

1544
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:47,960
(Moved)

1545
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,370
(The first date of the two men. What are they going to remember about each other?)

1546
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:02,300
(T Restaurant)

1547
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,660
(Eun-chan is waiting for his secret date)

1548
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,720
(Nervous)

1549
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:19,210
(Who asked Eun-chan for a secret date?)

1550
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:25,770
(A man is walking towards Eun-chan)

1551
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:36,810
It's the first time I've seen the man's back.

1552
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,060
Hello.

1553
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:43,690
Hello.

1554
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:45,490
Hello.

1555
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:50,190
(A stranger comes to meet Eun-chan?)

1556
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:52,930
A stranger shows up.
(A stranger comes to meet Eun-chan?)

1557
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:55,340
Why did he ask Eun-chan for a secret date?
(A stranger comes to meet Eun-chan?)

1558
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,870
Why did he ask Eun-chan for a secret date?

1559
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:05,180
(His Man)

1560
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:13,630
(While paragliding... Hyeok-jun's shoe disappeared Barefoot)

1561
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:14,370
What to do?

1562
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,050
((Hyeok-jun's shoe) what to do...)
What to do?

1563
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:15,730
((Hyeok-jun's shoe) what to do...)

1564
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:16,100
Got fun, and lost a shoe.

1565
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,260
(Cinderella Hyeok-jun: Got fun, but lost a shoe...)
Got fun, and lost a shoe.

1566
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,330
(Cinderella Hyeok-jun: Got fun, but lost a shoe...)

1567
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,690
But what are you going to do with your shoe?

1568
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:25,300
But your sock is white. It looks like you're wearing the shoe.

1569
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:28,260
(Before leaving, they got Hyeok-jun's shoe back safely)

1570
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:29,720
-Unknown to god. -Yeah. Unknown to god or ghost.
(Before leaving, they got Hyeok-jun's shoe back safely)

1571
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:30,560
-Unknown to god. -Yeah. Unknown to god or ghost.

1572
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,350
(Before leaving, they got Hyeok-jun's shoe back safely)

1573
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:34,230
-A dog.
-It's cute.

1574
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:36,610
(Dog)
-A dog.
-It's cute.

1575
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:38,880
-I also keep a dog at home.
-Really?

1576
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:40,640
((Exclusive favor))

1577
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,320
It looks quite like my dog.
((Exclusive favor))

1578
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,730
So cute.

1579
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:49,360
-It looks a bit old.
-Yes, it is.

1580
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,730
(Hyeon: It looks old. It's quite calm.)
-It looks a bit old.
-Yes, it is.

1581
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,730
It's quite calm.
(Hyeon: It looks old. It's quite calm.)

1582
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:54,490
(Confused)

1583
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:55,990
It likes to be stroked here.
(Confused)

1584
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:56,440
It likes to be stroked here.
