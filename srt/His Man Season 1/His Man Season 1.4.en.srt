Anyway, my image as Hokeep

76
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,880
is known to people,

77
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,230
so they think I'm so popular

78
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,360
and it might be very tiring to have a relationship with me.

79
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,510
But exactly because of that, I am not popular at all.

80
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,120
It's really annoying, isn't it?

81

It's unbelievable.

I'm also someone who has gone through military conscription.

So I hope it's someone who's been through that kind of life.

The view from the restaurant is also quaint.

00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,430
(Hahaha)

152
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,960
Did you prepare the flowers yourself?

153
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,130
Yes, I picked them...

154
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,750
It's the first time in my life

155
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,120
that I've received flowers as a gift.

156
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,940
I was a little flustered, and it also felt fascinating.

157
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,960
He prepared the flowers for me in advance.

158
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,040
I had never been on a blind date before.

159
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,790
I was looking forward to it, but I was excited and nervous.

160
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:58,800
Maybe... What's your profession? Can you tell me?

161
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,410
Would you like to take a guess?

162
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,770
Do you work in fashion or are you a tattoo artist?

163
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,320
I can see your tattoo here.

164
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,310
Oh, you're very observant.

165
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,510
((Curious) Jeong-ho: I'm a dancer. Eun-chan: Oh, you're a dancer?)

166
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,650
I'm a dancer.
((Curious) Jeong-ho: I'm a dancer. Eun-chan: Oh, you're a dancer?)

167
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:13,710
((Curious) Jeong-ho: I'm a dancer. Eun-chan: Oh, you're a dancer?)

168
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,900
-You're a dancer?
-Yes.
((Curious) Jeong-ho: I'm a dancer. Eun-chan: Oh, you're a dancer?)

169
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,920
You got the dancer vibe.

170
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,990
I do modern dance and…

171
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,250
Dance?

172
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,860
Voguing.

173
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,400
Sounds cool.

174
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,710
You're the type of person who gives off your own vibe.

175
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,890
So it sounds cool.

176
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,010
My connection with dance is …

177
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,830
I don't know if it's a connection.

178
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,890
Let me guess.

179
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,390
Sure, please.

180
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,090
So, actor?

181
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,010
Actor?

182
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,380
It makes me feel good. Thank you very much.

183
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,670
I was an idol trainee from the age of 16 to 23.

184

Now I'm doing something completely unrelated.

190
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,280
I work as a brand manager in a department store.
(Ah-ha. Eun-chan: Now I'm doing something completely unrelated)

191
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,840
I work as a brand manager in a department store.

192
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,550
(And then the silence...)

193
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:03,650
I'm really nervous.
(And then the silence...)

194
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,880
I'm really nervous.

195
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,010
Nervous.

196
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:09,720
(Being brave. Jeong-ho: Do you want to shake hands?)

197
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,030
Do you want to shake hands?
(Being brave. Jeong-ho: Do you want to shake hands?)

198
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,080
But I was so nervous.

199
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,860
-My palms are sweaty.
-Are they?

200
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,660
-Is it okay?
-It's okay.

201
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,030
(Two men who use a simple physical contact to eliminate the awkwardness)
-Is it okay?
-It's okay.

202
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,360
(Two men who use a simple physical contact to eliminate the awkwardness)

203
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,650
-Your hands are really cold.
-Your hands are warm.

204
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,160
Because I have a lot of fire in me.

205
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,260
I have cold hands and feet because I'm nervous.

206
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,750
Are you more introverted and cautious?

207
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,320
Yes.

208
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,890
Me, too.

209
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:32,600
Really?

210
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,450
I can't stand awkwardness.

211
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,770
I'd try to talk a lot.

212
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,020
I can relate to that.

213
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,390
That's why people think I'm so outgoing.

214
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,260
Me, too.

215
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,320
We like each other because we're the same.

216
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,520
Good.

217
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,730
(The awkwardness that comes between the nervousness)

218
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,160
I like people who are humorous more than those who are too sincere.
(The awkwardness that comes between the nervousness)

I like people who are humorous more than those who are too sincere.

220
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,110
I'm too... Nervous.

221
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,870
He's very good at leading conversations.

222
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,120
(Jeong-ho: (Eun-chan) He's very good at leading conversations)
He's very good at leading conversations.

223
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,950
I'm kind of attracted to that.

224
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,650
(The two men's first meal together)

225
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,630
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

226
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,330
It's good.

227
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,320
Good.

228
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,910
It's been a long time since I've eaten something like this with a man...

229
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:34,880
Me, too.

230
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,750
Do you have any hobbies?

231
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,550
Is it dancing, too?

232
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:49,330
I like to play games at home… Laze around or read books

233
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,970
I like to be quiet.

234
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,130
I would…Listen to songs, enjoy music.

235
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,200
(Eun-chan: I would…Listen to songs)
I would…Listen to songs, enjoy music.

236
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,740
I only listened to Kpop during my trainee days.

237
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:01,560
What was your position?

238
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,520
(Jeong-ho: (During your trainee days) What was your position?)
What was your position?

239
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,120
Idols all have a position in the team right?
(Jeong-ho: (During your trainee days) What was your position?)

240
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,520
Like the variety member.

241
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,350
Really?

242
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,670
(Haha)

243
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,680
(Shy)

244
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,960
But why did you quit?

245
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,940
What I can recall for now is that.

246
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,510
Yeah.

247
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,770
the company would evaluate the trainees at the end of the month.

248
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,300
Yeah.

249
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,270
The evaluation I heard at that time was,

250
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,690
"Eun-chan, do you think you're at the right age to be an idol?

251
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,030
I'm not curious about your stage."

252
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,360
I had heard such comments.

253
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,500
After the end of the month review, I took the bus home.

254
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,200
Yeah.

255
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,280
And I wept on the bus.

256
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,690
What to do?

257
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,850
Tears were flowing down my face.

258
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,880
After I was eliminated from the end-of-month evaluation,

259
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,270
the company fired me.

260
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,490
What to do?

261
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,280
It was really sad at the time, but now I just don't think

262
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,940
it was the right path for me to take.

263
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,190
I feel sorry to hear that.

264
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,510
I'm in a similar business.

265
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,600
(Jeong-ho shares the same feeling as Eun-chan)
I'm in a similar business.

266
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,580
Yes, it's a similar business.
(Jeong-ho shares the same feeling as Eun-chan)

267
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,300
Did I make you lose your appetite?

268
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,090
I think it's delicious.

269
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:29,770
Really?

270
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:30,860
I think it's delicious.

271
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,750
(Eun-chan smiles and pretends to be fine)
I think it's delicious.

272
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,250
(Eun-chan smiles and pretends to be fine)

273
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:33,320
I think it's good that you don't regret it.
(Eun-chan smiles and pretends to be fine)

274
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,550
I think it's good that you don't regret it.

275
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,340
Don't regret it and don't be obsessed with it.

276
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,240
I haven't regretted anything once in my life.

277
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:43,630
Really?

278
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:49,690
I think of it more as a valuable experience than a regret.

279
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,230
It's not a regret but an experience. That's really true.

280
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,840
What's your style when you're in love, brother?

281
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,690
Love style?

282
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,790
Love style?

283
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,610
Be sincere, but comfortable as a friend.

284
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,510
A sincere relationship

285
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,400
that will last long.

286
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,070
I came to this show.

287
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,460
I'm really looking for someone I can marry.

288
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:15,990
Marry?

289
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,810
(Panic)
Marry?

290
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,170
(Panic)

291
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:17,530
Because people of my age are all married.
(Panic)

292
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,770
Because people of my age are all married.

293
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,040
Yeah, right.

294
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,590
And I don't want to just have a relationship.

295
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,460
I want to have a wedding ceremony.

296
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,430
The two of us would dress in suits.

297
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,100
Once the curtain is open...

298
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,290
(Wow... Jeong-ho: Once the curtain is open...)
Once the curtain is open...

299
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,040
(Wow... Jeong-ho: Once the curtain is open...)

300
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,610
Putting on a beautiful makeup.

301
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:41,270
For other people, it's probably just an ordinary routine.

302
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,020
But for me, it's a dream. Can it come true?

303
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,650
(But for me, it's a dream)
But for me, it's a dream. Can it come true?

304
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,520
(But for me, it's a dream)

305
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,270
I want to be in a relationship with someone like that.

306
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,740
(Jeong-ho wants a sincere relationship that leads to marriage)
I want to be in a relationship with someone like that.

307

314
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,530
I thought he went out with Hyeon.

315
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,840
It bothered me a little.

316
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,890
(Can't hide the fact that he likes Hyeok-jun)

317
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,850
I'm starting to get full. Should we go out?

318
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,650
Sure.

319

(Next date route for the two men)

325
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,820
The weather is perfect for a date.

326
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,870
This weather?

327
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,470
Do you think so? Am I the only one who thinks so?

328
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:35,560
Isn't it better when it's sunny and breezy?

I like this kind of weather.

332
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,190
I like it better when it's cold than when it's hot.

333
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,810
Which season do you prefer, brother?

334
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,870
Between these two, I prefer hot summer days.

335
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,710
Really?

336
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,330
I don't go out much in the summer.

(Occasional awkwardness and silence in conversation)

338

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,350
But my current feeling

340
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,560
(Eun-chan: My current feelings for Hyeok-jun)
But my current feeling

341
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,550
doesn't change very much.

342
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,480
I feel like this is a social conversation for Eun-chan.

343
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,550
Is Eun-chan treating this as a business conversation?

Yeah.

Chang-min is going to have a nap?

459
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,890
(Nod. Seon-yul: Chang-min is going to have a nap?)
Chang-min is going to have a nap?

460
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,960
(Nod. Seon-yul: Chang-min is going to have a nap?)

461
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:10,870
(Seon-yul is afraid to blatantly ask Chang-min to go out.)

462
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,870
I feel like Seon-yul has the hots for Chan-gyu.

463
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,730
(Observing)

464
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,330
I'm full.

465
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,680
I'm full.

466
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,890
Just leave it to me.

467
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:29,930
That's too…

468
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:30,580
I can do it, really.

469
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:30,990
(I can do it, really. Really~? Haha)
I can do it, really.

470
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:31,210
(I can do it, really. Really~? Haha)

471
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:31,840
Really?
(I can do it, really. Really~? Haha)

472
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,640
(I can do it, really. Really~? Haha)

473
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,110
What did you say?

474
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:37,080
Did we really get left behind?

475
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,560
((Denying reality) Chang-min: Did we really get left behind?)
Did we really get left behind?

476
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:38,820
((Denying reality) Chang-min: Did we really get left behind?)

477
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,060
I'm so sad just thinking about it.
((Denying reality) Chang-min: Did we really get left behind?)

478
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,100
I'm so sad just thinking about it.

479
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,370
((Denying reality) Chang-min: I'm so sad just thinking about it.)
I'm so sad just thinking about it.

480
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:40,880
((Denying reality) Chang-min: I'm so sad just thinking about it.)

481
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,270
But only one person gets to choose his date today anyway.

482
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,480
But four people are gone now.

483
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,630
One of them went to the hospital though.

484
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,640
Okay. Time to disperse.

485
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,690
I don't think they'll come back in time.

486
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,930
(Constantly sad)
I don't think they'll come back in time.

487
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,870
Go have a rest.

488
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,210
Thank you.

489
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,120
How did it become like this?

490
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:06,160
(Chang-min chose to stay home to rest instead of going for a walk.)

491
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,220
I'll do the washing. Leave it to me.

492
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,980
How can I leave you here and go on my own?

493
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,570
What?

494
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,450
How can I leave you here and go on my own?

495
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,620
It's fine. Really.

496
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,200
No. You should come with me later.

497
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,720
(Chan-gyu: No. You should come with me later (for the walk).)
No. You should come with me later.

498
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,380
(Chan-gyu: No. You should come with me later (for the walk).)

499
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:34,400
(Chan-gyu quietly stays by Seon-yul's side.)

500
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,980
(There's silence between them for some reason.)

501
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:40,940
-See you in ten minutes.
-Okay.

502
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,650
(Okay! Seon-yul: See you in ten minutes (after we tidy it all up).)
-See you in ten minutes.
-Okay.

503
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,270
(Okay! Seon-yul: See you in ten minutes (after we tidy it all up).)

504
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:53,720
((Noiselessly))

505
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:59,600
(Keeping the noise down so as to not wake up Chang-min from his sleep.)

506
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,950
(Seon-yul and Chan-gyu go out for a walk on the sunny day.)

507
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,670
The cool wind is so comfortable.

508
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,490
There are still clouds in the sky, right?

509
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,180
It's a sunny day as long as I can see the sun.

510
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,830
-You are very optimistic.
-You bet I am.

511
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,000
The flowers are blossoming over there. It's full bloom, right?

512
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,470
(Beautiful flowers blossoming everywhere.)
The flowers are blossoming over there. It's full bloom, right?

513
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,040
It's beautiful. Can we go in?
(Beautiful flowers blossoming everywhere.)

514
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,230
It's beautiful. Can we go in?

515
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,120
(The two men got excited after seeing the flowers.)
It's beautiful. Can we go in?

516
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,370
(The two men got excited after seeing the flowers.)

517
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,910
-No. Come back.
-We can't?
(The two men got excited after seeing the flowers.)

518
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:23,010
-It's dangerous.
-But it looks so beautiful.

519
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:23,880
(It's dangerous!)
-It's dangerous.
-But it looks so beautiful.

520
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,560
-It's dangerous.
-But it looks so beautiful.

521
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,480
(It looks so beautiful!)
-It's dangerous.
-But it looks so beautiful.

522
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,350
This is someone's shop.

523
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,230
Keep going. There'll be more ahead of us.

524
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,240
Okay.

525
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:38,920
Is there anything that makes you feel down?

526
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,030
Anything at all? Or do you feel just fine?

527
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,760
Things that make me feel down? Well.

528
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,430
That you don't understand my feelings.

529
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,360
-Me?
-Yeah.

530
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,230
I've been expressing my feelings all the time.

531
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,530
But I don't know if you are for real.

532
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,900
You don't know if I'm for real?

533
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,080
Well. That hurts even more.

534
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,540
(Chan-gyu: Well. That hurts even more.)
Well. That hurts even more.

535
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,700
(Chan-gyu: Well. That hurts even more.)

536
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,230
(Seon-yul and Chan-gyu found a place to sit down and talk.)

537
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,630
I've never asked you this directly.

538
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,590
What is it?

539
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,290
We had an official date yesterday, right?

540
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:09,890
Yeah.

541
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,910
But after the date,

542
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,380
why would you keep flirting with me?

543
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,270
(Seon-yul: Why would you keep flirting with me?)
why would you keep flirting with me?

544
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:17,680
You have dated both of us.

545
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,510
(Chan-gyu Eun-chan VS Chan-gyu: You have dated both of us.)
You have dated both of us.

546
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,020
Yeah.
(Chan-gyu Eun-chan VS Chan-gyu: You have dated both of us.)
You have dated both of us.

547
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,060
Who do you feel better with?

548
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:22,610
Who do you feel better with?

549
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,630
(Who do you feel better with? X2)
Who do you feel better with?

550
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,260
-Let's go to the blind spot of the monitor.
-Let's go.

551
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,010
Okay.

552
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:26,300
-Wow. So soon?
-Does it have a blind spot here?

553
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,860
(Eun-chan: Wow. (You guys progressed) so soon?)
Hyeok-jun: Does it have a blind spot here?)
-Wow. So soon?
-Does it have a blind spot here?

554
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,760
Not really.

555
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,380
You can have a taste.

556
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:31,500
Will it be possible for you to feed me?

557
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,930
(Gazing. Chan-gyu: Will it be possible for you to feed me?)
Will it be possible for you to feed me?

558
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:33,800
(Gazing. Chan-gyu: Will it be possible for you to feed me?)

559
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,140
(Shocked. Panic.)

560
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,230
No. I flirted with you because I like you.

561
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,780
Why would I flirt with someone I don't even like?

562
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,270
It's just that I've spent some time with you,

563
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,110
and I'm getting more comfortable around you.

564
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,210
It'd be a lie if I said that I don't like you more

565
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,330
than at the first day.

566
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,700
That's why I kept kidding with you.

567
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,070
Because he brought it up to me.

568
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,960
It made me feel that he had thought about

569
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,050
the jokes I had made with him.

570
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,120
I felt pretty happy.

571
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,620
So firstly, Chan-gyu…

572
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,650
It's only been three days since we met each other.

573
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,700
You don't know what kind of date awaits you in the future.

574
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,240
Right.

575
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,700
And you don't know who you'll form a bond with either.

576
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,840
So if you do that with me

577
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,310
in front of everyone else.

578
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,800
Have a nap with me, brother.

579
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,410
Come to the corner with me.

580
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,250
And you say it that loud.

581
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,850
I think it would be a great loss for you too.

582
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,670
Actually, just like you said,

583
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:56,110
I made jokes with you

584
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,940
because I know you better

585
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,850
than everybody else.

586
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,930
I can't say that's not one of the reasons.

587
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,160
Even more so since you know me better.

588
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,660
What?

589
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,480
Even more so since you know me better.

590
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,990
Well. Okay. Whatever you say.

591
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,750
If those flirtations he had with me

592
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,240
were more sincere than I thought,

593
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,060
I want to help him bring it down a little bit.

594
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,580
And what do I mean by that?

595
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,220
When I knew that he was for real,

596
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,280
my actions could upset him,

597
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:32,800
or even hurt him.

598
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,800
I could've done it without realizing it.

599
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,410
So I decided to tell him in advance.

600
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,060
I didn't feel great.

601
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,660
I didn't feel great,

602
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,990
but I can't just stay in the middle.

603
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,750
So I want to go with my heart and fight for it.

604
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,630
(Chan-gyu tries to play cool.)

605
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,780
The overcast is coming.

606
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,470
Let's go back to the dorm.

607
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,180
Time to get back.

608
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,760
The wind is getting stronger.

609
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,310
We'll catch a cold if we keep staying here.

610
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,230
-I'm getting dozy.
-Then let's head back.

611
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,900
-You are sleepy?
-Yeah, a bit.

612
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:05,720
Let's go.

613
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:13,480
(The two men have confirmed their different feelings…)

614
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,690
(The men's house)

615
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,020
(Chang-min took a nap during Seon-yul and Chan-gyu's walk.)

616
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,440
(Getting up)

617
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:32,700
(Going to the bathroom right after)

618
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,140
(Appearing suddenly)

619
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:41,570
(Meanwhile, Jeong-hyeon returned)

620
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,610
((Where is everybody?))

621
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,330
Brother?

622
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,140
What's going on? Where is everyone?

623
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,160
I felt heartbroken, genuinely.

624
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:55,310
Why didn't they wait for me?

625
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,020
(Jeong-hyeon: Why didn't they wait for me?)
Why didn't they wait for me?

626
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,280
I was so sad.

627
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,320
I even bought some Churros for them.

628
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,460
What?

629
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:10,580
I brought this. Let's eat.

630
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,010
(Jeong-hyeon: I brought this (Churros). Let's eat.)
I brought this. Let's eat.

631
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,030
Where are the other guys?

632
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,430
-I don't know.
-Eh?

633
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,090
(Eh?!)
-I don't know.
-Eh?

634
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,800
I just got up.

635
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,970
-Where did you sleep?
-In the room.

636
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,600
I just checked the room and there was no one, brother.

637
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,770
I just checked your room and no one was there.

638
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,370
I thought everyone went out to see the flowers.

639
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,760
No, I just got up.

640
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,990
I might be in the bathroom when you got in.

641
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,310
I got back just a minute ago.

642
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:33,550
I got back and no one's here.

643
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,510
(Jeong-hyeon: I got back and no one's here. (I was so sad.))
I got back and no one's here.

644
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,560
Did you go to the hospital?

645
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,210
Yeah. Just returned from there.

646
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,450
-I knew it.
-Knew what?

647
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,920
I just knew that Traditional Korean treatment is the best.

648
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,840
You went to the Traditional Korean clinic?

649
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,330
Yes, I did.

650
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,170
-Let's have some Churros.
-Churros.

651
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,640
(Let's have some Churros.)
-Let's have some Churros.
-Churros.

652
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,310
It looks interesting.

653
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:50,590
Churros.

654
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,130
(Wow)
Churros.

655
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:51,880
(Wow)

656
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,510
((So interesting))

657
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,920
Is this how it looks originally?

658
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,370
They just made it look like this.

659
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,090
(Taking a big bite)

660
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,380
So I was the only one left.

661
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,180
-That's right.
-They are all gone.

662
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:11,830
(Chang-min: They are all gone.)
-That's right.
-They are all gone.

663
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,610
I thought I was the only one in the house when I returned.
(Chang-min: They are all gone.)

664
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:15,460
I thought I was the only one in the house when I returned.

665
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,560
I didn't see you either. I was really hurt.

666
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:19,340
(Jeong-hyeon: How can they do that? We agreed to go together (to see the flowers).)

667
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,140
How can they do that? We agreed to go together.
(Jeong-hyeon: How can they do that? We agreed to go together (to see the flowers).)

668
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,840
(Jeong-hyeon: How can they do that? We agreed to go together (to see the flowers).)

669
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,870
-Let's go out.
-Really?

670
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,120
Yeah, let's go.

671
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:25,650
(Yeah, let's go. Really?)
Yeah, let's go.

672
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,050
Let's go take a walk first.
(Yeah, let's go. Really?)
Yeah, let's go.

673
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,470
Let's go take a walk first.

674
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:27,700
-Okay, let's go.
-For real? That's nice.

675
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,460
(Seon-yul: For real? That's nice.)
-Okay, let's go.
-For real? That's nice.

676
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,160
(Anticipating)

677
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,710
Okay.
(Anticipating)

678
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,000
(Anticipating)

679
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:33,930
The two of them went on their own.

680
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,730
They asked me to go with them.

681
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:37,860
But I didn't.

682
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,840
(Happy)

683
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,710
Chang-min stayed in the house alone.

684
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,160
So I was thinking something like

685
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,240
Chang-min was the best.

686
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:55,310
I really want to go see the flowers.

687
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:58,740
What do you do when you are there?

688
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,760
Admiring them, and smelling them.

689
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,180
Looking at all kinds of flowers and remembering them with my eyes.

690
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:04,880
((Vibe killer) Chang-min: You can do that within five minutes, right?)

691
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,420
You can do that within five minutes, right?
((Vibe killer) Chang-min: You can do that within five minutes, right?)

692
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,120
((Vibe killer) Chang-min: You can do that within five minutes, right?)

693
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,470
-Well.
-Where's the fun in that?
((Vibe killer) Chang-min: You can do that within five minutes, right?)

694
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,010
-Well.
-Where's the fun in that?

695
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:12,820
-The fun?
-Yeah.

696
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,830
(Jeong-hyeon: The fun?)
-The fun?
-Yeah.

697
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,210
(Jeong-hyeon: The fun?)

698
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:14,370
When you go there with some people,
(Jeong-hyeon: The fun?)

699
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,950
When you go there with some people,

700
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,060
everything will look just lovely, right?

701
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,640
I'm a very practical person.

702
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,920
But even I believe that sometimes people need to be sensitive.

703
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,260
I don't like aimlessly looking at stuff.

704
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,200
It'll be nice sitting under the trees and sipping some rice wine.

705
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,460
You really like drinking.

706
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,340
The wine you drink there will be good for you.

707
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:38,920
-Like some extra dish?
-Yeah.

708
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,190
(Jeong-hyeon: Like some extra dish?)
-Like some extra dish?
-Yeah.

709
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,310
(Jeong-hyeon: You practically spent the whole day resting at home.)

710
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,420
-You practically spent the whole day resting at home.
-Yeah.
(Jeong-hyeon: You practically spent the whole day resting at home.)

711
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,810
You think it's relaxing?

712
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,260
I've always been an indoor person.

713
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,670
But ever since I opened a restaurant,

714
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,570
I've been spending a lot of time in noisy surroundings

715
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:56,180
because the upbeat music we play there.

716
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:00,200
So I find it very relaxing and comforting at home.

717
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,150
Because this is where you rest.

718
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:01,340
(Jeong-hyeon: Because this is where you rest, a place only belongs to yourself?)
Because this is where you rest.

719
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,900
-Really.
-A place only belongs to yourself?
(Jeong-hyeon: Because this is where you rest, a place only belongs to yourself?)

720
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,900
And my dog is at home.

721
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,090
(Jeong-hyeon: Dog? What breed?)

722
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,770
-Dog.
-Dog? What breed?
(Jeong-hyeon: Dog? What breed?)

723
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,570
-Chihuahua.
-Chihuahua.

724
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:09,580
((It must be very cute.))

725
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:09,830
It always welcomes me so excitedly.
((It must be very cute.))

726
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,780
It always welcomes me so excitedly.

727
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,050
So you are good with dogs.

728
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,870
(Kidding.
Jeong-hyeon: So you are good with dogs.)
So you are good with dogs.

729
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:15,610
(Kidding.
Jeong-hyeon: So you are good with dogs.)

730
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,040
You need to ask the dog's opinion.

731
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:22,820
I miss it so much.

732
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,470
Who? The guys?

733
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,270
Maro. Maro.

734
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,130
Is that its name? Maro?

735
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:28,890
(Jeong-hyeon: Is that its name? Maro?)
Is that its name? Maro?

736
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:29,220
-Yeah.
-My dog is called Maru.
(Jeong-hyeon: Is that its name? Maro?)
Is that its name? Maro?

737
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:29,280
-Yeah.
-My dog is called Maru.

738
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,390
(Jeong-hyeon: My dog is called Maru.)
-Yeah.
-My dog is called Maru.

739
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:32,000
-Maru?
-Yeah.

740
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,770
(Maru?)
-Maru?
-Yeah.

741
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:32,940
Really? Why do you call it Maru?
(Maru?)
-Maru?
-Yeah.

742
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,450
Really? Why do you call it Maru?

743
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,560
It's called Maru because it was born on a wooden floor.

744
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:37,690
(Hahaha.)

745
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:38,340
Really.
(Hahaha.)

746
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,070
(Hahaha.)

747
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:40,110
At the beginning, his expression and tone of voice

748
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,800
(Jeong-hyeon: At the beginning, his (Chang-min's) expression and tone of voice)
At the beginning, his expression and tone of voice

749
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,540
gave me the impression that he's emotionless or expressionless.

750
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:49,970
But as I get to know him, I found he's the type of person who's easy to understand.

751
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:53,120
No? I don't know now.

752
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,700
(No…? I don't know now. Haha.)
No? I don't know now.

753
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,080
(No…? I don't know now. Haha.)

754
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,970
People like you don't like to hold grudges.

755
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,860
I don't know if it's because I'm the same kind of person,

756
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,030
I'm also like this, holding no grudge.

757
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,870
I'm the type of person who would make others sad.

758
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,350
-Sad?
-Yeah.

759
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,780
Especially the families.

760
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,590
Me too. My mum feels sad, too.

761
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,580
(Chang-min: She always complains about me not keeping in touch with her.)
-She always complains about me not keeping in touch with her.
-Right.

762
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,170
My mum once thought I was dead.

763
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,510
I told her that I was going to the hospital

764
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,030
and didn't contact her for the next month.

765
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,270
So, she thought I was dead.

766
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,500
Finally, it was her who called me first.

767
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,600
Before hanging up, I always promised to keep in touch

768
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,270
and call her again, but I never did.

769
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,060
(Chang-min: but I never did.)
and call her again, but I never did.

770
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,090
(Chang-min: but I never did.)

771
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:35,830
(Chang-min: Jeong-hyeon has a lot in common with me personality-wise.)

772
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,970
Jeong-hyeon has a lot in common with me
(Chang-min: Jeong-hyeon has a lot in common with me personality-wise.)

773
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:37,260
(Chang-min: Jeong-hyeon has a lot in common with me personality-wise.)

774
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,510
personality-wise.
(Chang-min: Jeong-hyeon has a lot in common with me personality-wise.)

775
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:38,610
(Chang-min: So, I think we can better understand each other.)

776
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,190
So, I think we can better understand each other.
(Chang-min: So, I think we can better understand each other.)

777
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,720
I think we have a rapport.

778
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,690
I don't know what Jeong-hyeon thinks about it.

779
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,790
But that's what I think.

780
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,100
That's the conclusion after spending the day together.

781
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,680
We need to go to the grocer's. There's nothing left in the fridge.

782
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,090
-We need to go to the grocer's.
-Okay, sure.

783
00:30:59,090 --> 00:30:59,510
(Okay.)
-We need to go to the grocer's.
-Okay, sure.

784
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,150
(Okay.)

785
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,900
When the others come back, we need to determine who'll be on duty tonight.

786
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:03,360
Will they come back tonight?

787
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,430
(Kidding. Chang-min: Will they come back tonight?)
Will they come back tonight?

788
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,540
(Kidding. Chang-min: Will they come back tonight?)

789
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:05,610
It's fine even if they don't come back.
(Kidding. Chang-min: Will they come back tonight?)

790
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,100
It's fine even if they don't come back.

791
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,770
Could anything have happened to them?

792
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:13,530
-Thank you for the food.
-I enjoyed the food, too.

793
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,640
(Chang-min: Thank you for the food.)
-Thank you for the food.

795
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,440
(Oh?!)

796
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:17,020
-You're back?
-Uh? You're back?

797
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,420
(Seon-yul: You're back?)
-You're back?
-Uh? You're back?

798
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,630
Where have you been?

799
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,530
We were out for a walk.

800
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,640
Did you have fun?

801
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,460
Yeah.

802
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,590
Shall we go to the grocer's?

803
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:24,900
(Seon-yul: To the grocer's? Sure.)

804
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,000
-To the grocer's? Sure.
-We got to do it.
(Seon-yul: To the grocer's? Sure.)

805
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,000
(Shopping cart! Shopping cart! Four men coming to the supermarket)

806
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,740
Shopping cart! Shopping cart!
(Shopping cart! Shopping cart! Four men coming to the supermarket)

807
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,840
-Where are the shopping carts?
-Back there.
(Shopping cart! Shopping cart! Four men coming to the supermarket)

808
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,840
(Shopping cart! Shopping cart! Four men coming to the supermarket)

809
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:33,320
The boss here is not good at choosing fruits.

810
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,110
(Jeong-hyeon is complaining with Chang-min: The boss here is not good at choosing fruits.)
The boss here is not good at choosing fruits.

811
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,510
These are clearly not fresh.

812
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,150
Because many people pinched them.

813
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,890
Look at this one. It feels hard.

814
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:41,550
It feels hard.

815
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:41,830
I always choose the hard ones.

816
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,500
(Chang-min: I always choose the hard ones (fruits).)
I always choose the hard ones.

818
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:44,720

(Chang-min: I chose those with good a texture.)
I chose those hard ones, right?

I did it very carefully.

00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,950
You look like a couple on the outs.

825
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:52,830
Seon-yul said

826
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,500
that we're like a newly-married couple on the outs.

827
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,320
I like feeling that way.

828
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,300
So, I wish to be like that.

829
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:04,310
-This is not enough.
-Why is it not enough?

830
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,700
(Chang-min: Why is it not enough?)
-This is not enough.

833
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,960
How much shrimp sauce do you want to eat?

834
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,050
It's too small.

835
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,690
Uh? It's braised beef.

836
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,100
No. Just buy something we'll eat.

837
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:13,670
(Chang-min: Let's just buy something we can make (meals with).)

We need to pick these carefully.

(Chang-min: Wow. There're so many different ones.)

((Shall we buy some alcohol?))

844
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,720
I'd like to try this lemon flavor, too.
((Shall we buy some alcohol?))

Thank you!

846

Put it here.

(Neatly!)

848

Be careful. Don't squish the strawberries.

(Carefully!)

863
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,130
We can cook this after crushing it, right?

It's good. I think salty seaweed is fine.

Are we done shopping?

874
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,510
Yeah. Better not to come back again.

It's not so cold now, right?

00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,050
It's a bit cold, but…

879
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,410
Because it's raining suddenly.

880
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,260
What could they be doing inside?

881

00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,290
(Anticipating! Curious!)

906
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,270
(Jeong-hyeon: Oh?)

907
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,890
(What?)

908
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,080
(Eun-chan coming back with flowers)

909
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,340
(Carefully)

910
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,580
Where have you been?

911
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,199
I received the flowers.

912
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:16,429
-What?
-What?

913
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,870
(Seon-yul: What?)
-What?
-What?

914
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:18,020
(Hyeok-jun: So, you were out with someone.)

915
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,449
-So, you were out with someone.
-Something happened?
(Hyeok-jun: So, you were out with someone.)

916
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,340
(Really?)

917
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,150
The flowers were really eye-catching.

918
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,170
What?

919
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:26,070
-Where have you been?
-I'm really surprised.

920
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,670
(Chang-min: Where have you been?)
-Where have you been?
-I'm really surprised.

921
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,239
I was asked out for a secret date.
(Chang-min: Where have you been?)

922
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,320
I was asked out for a secret date.

923
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,090
(Surprised!)

924
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,460
Really surprised.

925
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,480
So, there is a new man.

926
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,520
I was out with him.

927
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,810
You were on a date.

928
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,710
Do you know why he asked you for a date?

929
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,830
He chose me

930
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:47,280
based on six mission cards.

931
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,810
(Chang-min: Do you know why he asked you for a date?)
based on six mission cards.

932
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:49,889
-He chose based on our personalities.
-Oh, personality.

933
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:53,550
(Eun-chan: He chose based on our personalities.)
-He chose based on our personalities.
-Oh, personality.

934
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,380
-He chose based on our personalities.
-What personality?
(Eun-chan: He chose based on our personalities.)

935
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:55,520
(Chang-min: What's (what did you write) on it?)
-He chose based on our personalities.
-What personality?
(Eun-chan: He chose based on our personalities.)

936
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,580
What's on it?
(Chang-min: What's (what did you write) on it?)

937
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,610
A humorous and straight-forward man.

938
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,010
(Oh~ (Agree))

939
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:00,890
Straight-forward.

940
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,400
Wow. It must be very interesting.

941
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:06,790
(Jeong-ho who is sneaking in while the others are talking)

942
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,520
(Nervous! Nervous!)

943
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,770
Firstly, I was really curious.

944
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:10,750
(Jeong-ho: Because I was really curious.)
Firstly, I was really curious.

945
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:10,890
I knew neither how many men were inside nor who they were.
(Jeong-ho: Because I was really curious.)
Firstly, I was really curious.

946
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,790
I knew neither how many men were inside nor who they were.

947
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:14,910
(Smoothing his hair. Jeong-ho: I need to show myself, too.)

948
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,820
I need to show myself, too.
(Smoothing his hair. Jeong-ho: I need to show myself, too.)

949
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,610
To wag my fox's tail.

950
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,900
I wasn't worried.

951
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,600
I was just a little excited.

952
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,430
Hello!

953
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,210
Hello, everyone!

954
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:33,310
(Ah. Jeong-ho who finally meets the other men in the men's house.)
Hello, everyone!

955
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:33,990
(Ah. Jeong-ho who finally meets the other men in the men's house.)

956
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,180
-Hello!
-Hello, nice to meet you.
(Ah. Jeong-ho who finally meets the other men in the men's house.)

957
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:35,420
(Ah. Jeong-ho who finally meets the other men in the men's house.)

958
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,240
Nice to meet you.
(Ah. Jeong-ho who finally meets the other men in the men's house.)

959
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,930
(Ah. Jeong-ho who finally meets the other men in the men's house.)

960
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,100
In my mind,

961
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,110
(Smiling Jeong-ho: In my mind,)
In my mind,

962
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,200
(Smiling Jeong-ho: I just thought, “He must be there.”)

963
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,250
I just thought, “He must be there.”
(Smiling Jeong-ho: I just thought, “He must be there.”)

964
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,230
He was really there today.

965
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,370
Friend?

966
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:45,610
Many Drag Artists and dancers know each other.

967
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:52,070
(Hyeon: Many Drag Artists and dancers know each other.)
Many Drag Artists and dancers know each other.

968
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,380
(Shy)

969
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:56,720
This is the man who gave me the flowers.

970
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,970
There are eight of us now.

971
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:02,200
-Yeah, eight men now.
-Yes.

972
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,470
(Yeah, eight men now.)
-Yeah, eight men now.
-Yes.

973
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,290
-Yeah, eight men now.
-Yes.

974
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,210
Would you please introduce yourself?

975
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,930
Hello, everyone!

976
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:09,220
I'm Lee Jeong-ho, 31 years old.

977
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,540
(Jeong-ho: I'm Lee Jeong-ho, 31 years old.)
I'm Lee Jeong-ho, 31 years old.

978
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:12,640
I'm a dancer.

979
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,210
(Jeong-ho: I'm a dancer.)
I'm a dancer.

980
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:14,710
(Jeong-ho: I'm a dancer.)

981
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,280
Very handsome!

982
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,420
He's really handsome.

983
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,220
He gave me a good impression.

984
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,050
He has a strong presence.

985
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:26,170
He has a small build but a strong presence.

986
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:31,420
The battle of love will start again.

987
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,710
I guessed that you'd be here.

988
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,200
So, you know each other.

989
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,400
Let's talk as friends then.

990
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,590
We know each other anyway.

991
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,760
Okay, all right.

992
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,900
You chose someone for a date.

993
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,460
Yes.

994
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:44,900
Did you have any reason to pick the card?

995
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,060
(Seon-yul: Did you have any reason to pick the (Eun-chan's) card?)
Did you have any reason to pick the card?

996
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,770
Six men's personalities were written on the cards.

997
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,500
I picked based on that.

998
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,410
(Chan-gyu: What personalities were written on the cards?)
What personalities were written on the cards?

999
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,810
Although I don't remember all,

1000
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,440
let's guess who they are.

1001
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,130
There's a cute man.

1002
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,020
A cute man?

1003
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,530
-Yes, it's you, Chan-gyu.
-It's Chan-gyu.

1004
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,550
A mischievous man.

1005
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:06,330
(Me?!)

1006
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:07,670
Is it me? Is it me?
(Me?!)

1007
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:07,810
I don't think so.

1008
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:08,650
(Hyeon?)
I don't think so.

1009
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:08,770
No, it's Jeong-hyeon.
(Hyeon?)
I don't think so.

1010
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:09,990
No, it's Jeong-hyeon.

1011
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,050
It's like

1012
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:16,690
mischievous on the inside but not on the outside.

1013
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,030
-Then…
-Then that's me.

1014
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,120
(Hyeon: Then that's me.)
-Then…
-Then that's me.

1015
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,000
(Hyeon: Then that's me.)

1016
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:21,340
I think it's someone over here?

1017
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,360
(Hyeok-jun: I think it's Chang-min over here?)
I think it's someone over here?

1018
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:26,790
(A mischievous man who doesn't look naughty)

1019
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:33,440
(He looks cold, but is actually mischievous)

1020
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,020
The room seems to be wider.

1021
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:38,670
Yeah. It's the right number now.

1022
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,910
(Jeong-hyeon: It's the right number now.)
Yeah. It's the right number now.

1023
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:40,990
But I feel too far from there. It's too far.
(Jeong-hyeon: It's the right number now.)
Yeah. It's the right number now.

1024
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:41,300
But I feel too far from there. It's too far.

1025
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,660
(It's too far.)
But I feel too far from there. It's too far.

1026
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,080
But I feel too far from there. It's too far.

1027
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,760
(It's too far.)
But I feel too far from there. It's too far.

1028
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:43,950
The sofa is full now.
(It's too far.)
But I feel too far from there. It's too far.

1029
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:44,040
The sofa is full now.

1030
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,700
(Eun-chan: The sofa is full now.)
The sofa is full now.

1031
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,740
(Still feeling shy)

1032
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,150
What's your first impression of us?

1033
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:51,220
(Jeong-ho's first impression of the other men)

1034
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,280
My first impression?
(Jeong-ho's first impression of the other men)

1035
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,630
(Jeong-ho's first impression of the other men)

1036
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,370
The men who impressed me the most were

1037
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,340
Hyeok-jun and Chang-min.

1038
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,840
They're very handsome.

1039
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:07,690
(That night)

1040
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:12,220
(Time for Jeong-ho to make his first call.)

1041
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,850
OK.

1042
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,700
(Discreet)

1043
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:23,260
(Picking up the phone after thinking)

1044
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,360
Uh? Why doesn't he answer the phone?

1045
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:35,870
(Nervous. Who is the man not answering Jeong-ho's phone call?)

1046
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,220
(His Man)

1047
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,200
(Dinner time for the four men who stayed in the house)

1048
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,150
I'm hungry.
(Dinner time for the four men who stayed in the house)

1049
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:40,940
(Dinner time for the four men who stayed in the house)

1050
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,820
What am I supposed to do?

1051
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,290
Shall we fry this?

1052
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:46,840
With what?

1053
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,460
Green onion.

1054
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,150
Green onion pancake?

1055
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:48,860
No, no.

1056
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:49,170
Green onion is not used for pancakes.

1057
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,770
(Surprised! Seon-yul: Green onion is not used for pancake…)
Green onion is not used for pancakes.

1058
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,570
Should it be scallion?

1059
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,540
Yes.

1060
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:55,690
Eggs.

1061
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:56,420
Yes, beat the eggs.

1062
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,720
(Feeling uneasy. Seon-yul: Yes, beat the eggs.)
Yes, beat the eggs.

1063
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:57,910
(Feeling uneasy. Seon-yul: Yes, beat the eggs.)

1064
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,540
But aren't beaten eggs used for baking?
(Feeling uneasy. Seon-yul: Yes, beat the eggs.)

1065
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:58,730
But aren't beaten eggs used for baking?

1066
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,740
(Jeong-hyeon: But aren't beaten eggs used for baking to make dough with flour?)
But aren't beaten eggs used for baking?

1067
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:00,970
Yes, but it's the same for making pancakes.
(Jeong-hyeon: But aren't beaten eggs used for baking to make dough with flour?)
But aren't beaten eggs used for baking?

1068
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:01,080
Yes, but it's the same for making pancakes.

1069
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,940
(Kindly. Seon-yul: Yes, but it's the same for making pancakes.)
Yes, but it's the same for making pancakes.

1070
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,920
(Haha (Can we enjoy the dinner tonight?))

1071
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,030
I think small pumpkin pies should have no water.
(Haha (Can we enjoy the dinner tonight?))

1072
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,440
I think small pumpkin pies should have no water.

1073
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,490
(Making small pumpkin pies instead with more confidence)

1074
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,410
What's wrong with the knife?
(Making small pumpkin pies instead with more confidence)

1075
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:11,890
(Making small pumpkin pies instead with more confidence)

1076
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:12,290
(Uneasy! Dangerous! Chang-min: Just cut it there?)

1077
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,290
Just cut it there?
(Uneasy! Dangerous! Chang-min: Just cut it there?)

1078
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:13,880
(Uneasy! Dangerous! Chang-min: Just cut it there?)

1079
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,200
It's where the spam was cut.

1080
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:19,310
Vegetables should not be cut on the cutting board for meat.

1081
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,630
(Fed up! Shy! Jeong-hyeon: He just sits there and keeps grumbling.)

1082
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,200
He just sits there and keeps grumbling.
(Fed up! Shy! Jeong-hyeon: He just sits there and keeps grumbling.)

1083
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:23,960
(Fed up! Shy! Jeong-hyeon: He just sits there and keeps grumbling.)

1084
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,450
Do you want me to dip those pumpkins in the beaten eggs?

1085
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,500
(Chang-min still offers to help despite the grumbling.)
-Sure.
-OK, let me help you with that.

1086
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,180
(Chang-min still offers to help despite the grumbling.)

1087
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,780
So many.

1088
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,610
But I like pumpkin pies.

1089
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:32,170
-Really?
-Yeah.

1090
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,260
(Jeong-hyeon: Really?)
-Really?
-Yeah.

1091
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,430
(A simple yet nice dinner prepared by the four men who stayed at home)

1092
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:37,670
(Bean sprout soup made by Jeong-hyeon)

1093
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,510
I'm anticipating!
(Bean sprout soup made by Jeong-hyeon)

1094
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,180
(Bean sprout soup made by Jeong-hyeon)

1095
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,490
(The dishes are full)

1096
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,750
Oh, it looks nice.

1097
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,790
It's bean sprout soup.

1098
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,840
Bon appetit.

1099
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,080
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

1100
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,220
(Bon appetit)
- Bon appetit.

1101
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:49,680
(Bon appetit)

1102
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:50,850
((Pretending) Chang-min: Well, it's too much for me.
Jeong-hyeon: Should've given you that much you'd want.)

1103
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,980
Well, it's too much for me.
((Pretending) Chang-min: Well, it's too much for me.
Jeong-hyeon: Should've given you that much you'd want.)

1104
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,930
Should've given you that much you'd want.
((Pretending) Chang-min: Well, it's too much for me.
Jeong-hyeon: Should've given you that much you'd want.)

1105
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:54,480
Yeah.

1106
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,720
You'll eat them all, right, brother?

1107
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,650
(Admiring)

1108
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,410
Because I've had so much.

1109
00:39:59,410 --> 00:39:59,840
(Gratified)
Because I've had so much.

1110
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,070
(Gratified)

1111
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:04,150
(Very much in love! The men's dinner time.)
