1
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,330
(These brave men's)

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,170
(true love)

3
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,810
(Their romance)

4
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,890
(His Man)

5
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,180
In this spring of cherry blossoms,

6
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,790
in pursuit of true love,

7
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,290
these men gathered here.

8
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,070
These brave men will confess their love

9
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,170
in this house.

10
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,710
The door of the house will now open.

11
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,250
(His Man)

12
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,800
(His Man)

13
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:06,610
(Oh, the first man arrives)

14
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,860
My appearance is the opposite of my personality.

15
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,470
I hear people say that about me a lot.

16
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,600
My ideal type of man.

17
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,770
It'd be cute if he's shorter than me.

18
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,320
If he's taller than me, it'd be cute, too.

19
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,460
I wish we get to know each other in a mature way.

20
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,720
I want to have a peaceful relationship.

21
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,140
Can I open the door?

22
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:47,690
(The second man arrives)

23
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,630
My ideal type is 175cm or taller

24
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:00,220
with monolid eyes.

25
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,610
(Prefer someone who is good at self-management)

26
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,460
If I get the chance,

27
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,440
I would like to meet his families.

28
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,910
I'd like to meet someone who is sincere.

29
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,530
(Enter the third man)

30
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,960
If he looks good, I hope he's like Cha Eun-woo.

31
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,400
If he's masculine,

32
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,950
I hope he's like Woo Do-hwan or Kim Woo-bin.

33
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,220
I like that type.

34
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,490
To be honest, I've had many love triangles before,

35
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,000
but I've always managed to win.

36
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,480
He has to be good looking, have a good personality,

37
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,390
be able to earn money, or may be even younger than me.

38
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,390
Hit the jackpot.

39
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:09,010
(Footsteps of the fourth man)

40
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:17,100
My ideal type is... Someone who can dress better than me,

41
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,760
and hopefully do some self-management.

42
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,670
I never hesitate.

43
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,670
If I have a crush on someone,

44
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,110
I will take the initiative.

45
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,390
Because I want to have a regretless relationship.

46
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,860
I hope I can fall in love here.

47
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:45,490
(The fifth man comes to the house)

48
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,000
(Wow)

49
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,630
My ideal type should be the opposite of me

50
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,670
in appearance.

51
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,100
I hope he is slender, fair and has long fingers.

52
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,690
Since we are both men, there is no obstacle.

53
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,590
We tend to have physical contact quicker too.

54
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,460
I have confidence in my voice.

55
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,779
I will attract them with my voice.

56
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:28,640
(The sixth man)

57
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,070
I like men with boyish beauty.

58
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,700
I hope he has a cheerful personality.

59
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,800
I hope he has a beautiful smile.

60
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,210
Because I don't smile much.

61
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,800
I don't think it will be easy.

62
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:52,420
I hope he has similar living habits to me.

63
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,740
(Will we meet our ideal type here?)

64
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,480
Will these men find true love here?
(Will we meet our ideal type here?)

65
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,490
(Will we meet our ideal type here?)

66
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,390
These ordinary yet special men

67
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,670
who have built up their courage to find love.

68
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:20,570
(The house of six men)

69
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,600
These men will live together in a house for men.
(The house of six men)

70
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,290
(The house of six men)

71
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,610
New environment and a bunch of strangers.

72
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,320
What will happen here?

73
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,330
Where are all the men going?

74
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,450
(It's empty?!)
Where are all the men going?

75
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,490
(It's empty?!)

76
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,860
(Some men are coming, some are waiting)

77
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,090
Are we going somewhere?
(Some men are coming, some are waiting)

78
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:51,700
(Some men are coming, some are waiting)

79
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,090
What am I going to do there?
(Some men are coming, some are waiting)

80
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,050
(Some men are coming, some are waiting)

81
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,170
(30 minutes ago...)

82
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,810
(An empty living room)

83
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,450
(Pops head)

84
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,520
(Wow)

85
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,370
(Found some cards lying on the table)

86
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,650
(Pick a card and go to the address indicated on it)

87
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,930
(Heart fluttering)

88
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,570
(Thinking)

89
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,470
This one.

90
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,050
(Frowning)

91
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,100
Here we go.

92
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,010
(Choosing one carefully)

93
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,500
I'm excited but also worried.

94
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,420
Ji-Gwang-in 17.

95
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,950
I haven't see any other person yet.

96
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,050
Why are they sending me to go there alone?

97
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,880
Only an address on it.

98
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,090
Maybe it's a restaurant or a café.

99
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,390
But there is no other information,

100
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,730
so I had no clue.

101
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,330
Do I just have to go there?

102
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,810
(Tilted)
Do I just have to go there?

103
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,650
(Chose without hesitation)

104
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,750
I only had two cards in front of me.

105
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,130
(Is there no one at all?)

106
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,690
I thought the others would be waiting for me.

107
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,650
But no. There was only a card there.

108
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,690
So should I just go to this place?

109
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:44,650
(Where would the six cards lead them?)

110
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,970
(A card that leads to an exciting first date)

111
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,050
(Fiddle)

112
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,720
(Jeong-hyeon)

113
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,650
(Peeking)

114
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,690
(Eun-chan)

115
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,370
(Nervous)

116
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,690
(Hyeok-jun)

117
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,950
I wondered who was coming.

118
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,020
I was nervous. My hands were shaking.

119
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,130
(Curious)

120
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,330
(Who will be their first date?)

121
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:46,650
(Men are walking excitedly to the first date venue.)

122
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,240
(Chan-gyu)

123
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,490
(Who are waiting for them?)

124
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,010
(Chang-min)

125
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:04,970
(Can we meet our ideal type?)

126
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,050
(Who is Chang-min's first date?)

127
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:09,410
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

128
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,850
(Hello, Chang-min)
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

(Smiling)

130
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,180
-Hello.
-Yeah.
(Smiling)

131
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,830
He's neat, tall and warm.

132
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,040
He has sharp features.

133
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,870
I think he's cool.

134
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,690
This is a nice café.

135
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,090
Yeah。

136
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,440
It's nice outside, too.

137
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,720
Yes, the weather is good.

138
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,100
It's kind of hot outside.

139
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,020
I feel OK.

140
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,650
I'm nervous.

141
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,490
(A thrilling first meeting)

142
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,530
(Another man who is waiting for the first date)

143
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,530
(Suddenly nervous)

144
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,490
(Seon-yul)

145
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,290
(Three seconds to meeting)

146
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,290
(Two seconds)

147
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,490
(One second)

148
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,510
Hello.

149
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,730
Hello.

150
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,500
Nice to meet you.

151
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,590
Am I in the right place?

152
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,570
Are you alone?

153
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,950
Yes, I came alone.

154
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,670
Shall we shake hands?

155
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,000
Sure, good to meet you.

156
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,390
It's hot out there.

157
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,570
It's a nice day.

158
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,880
What's your name?

159
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,410
My name is Jeon Eun-chan.

160
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,850
I'm Kim Seon-yul.

161
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:31,770
Kim Seon-yul?

162
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,410
Yes.

(Smiling)
Hello.

164
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,990
His skin is very white.

165
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,770
He made a good impression on me.

166
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,680
Your name is like a cartoon name.

167
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,510
Really?

168
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,400
I have to be more handsome to deserve the cartoon name.

169
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,070
You're handsome enough.

170
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:50,410
No, I'm not.

171
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,130
(Blushing)
No, I'm not.

172
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,170
(Blushing)

173
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,010
(Heart fluttering)

174
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,480
(Two men and their heart fluttering first meeting)

175
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,640
Your skin looks great.

176
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,240
I put on a bit of makeup.

177
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,070
(Pfft)

178
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,240
You're so honest.
(Pfft)

179
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,950
It's important for me to make a good first impression.

180
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,540
(Nod, nod)

181
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:10,610
Right.
(Nod, nod)

182
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,260
Right.

183
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,370
(Still a little awkward)

184
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,570
I'm too nervous.

185
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,540
It makes me so shy.

186
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,250
Exactly.

187
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:23,740
(Two men who can't look at each other)
Exactly.

188
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,980
(Two men who can't look at each other)

189
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,050
In fact, just now I felt it was unreal.
(Two men who can't look at each other)

190
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,100
In fact, just now I felt it was unreal.

191
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,050
I felt unreal.

192
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,470
(Eun-chan is continuing conversation naturally)
I felt unreal.

193
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,800
(Eun-chan is continuing conversation naturally)

194
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,710
You can see the door, right?
(Eun-chan is continuing conversation naturally)

195
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,370
(Eun-chan is continuing conversation naturally)

196
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,450
You can see who's coming in.

197
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,290
I don't think anyone's coming.

198
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,030
I think we should just have our date.

199
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,520
I think we should just have our date.

200
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,140
You're straightforward.

201
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,610
(Rubbing. Saying something straightforward can also be heart fluttering)

202
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,930
(Peeking)

203
00:11:59,220 --> 00:11:59,930
But…

204
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,000
About the age…

205
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,610
I know we can't say it.

206
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:05,930
(Men's house Rules First day
Don't tell others your age and occupation)
I know we can't say it.

207
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:06,740
(Men's house Rules First day
Don't tell others your age and occupation)

208
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,160
-Can we guess?
-Yes.
(Men's house Rules First day
Don't tell others your age and occupation)

209
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,330
(Men's house Rules First day
Don't tell others your age and occupation)

210
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,240
27.

211
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,570
((Nod, nod?))

212
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,420
Did I say something wrong?

213
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,670
You're about 28?

214
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,480
-You think so?
-Yeah.

215
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,450
(Satisfied?)

216
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,720
-Are you older than that?
-What?

217
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,280
Judging by your face, are you older?

218
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,240
No.

219
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,090
(Peeking)

220
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,780
But you look very young.

221
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,050
Thank you.

222
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,120
It's just…

223
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:47,310
My facial features are not sharp.

224
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,090
So I look like that way.

225
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,350
That's why you look young.

226
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,010
I like men with sharp facial features.

227
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,420
I am envious of those with soft ones.

228
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,230
((Just like you, Chang-min…))

229
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:01,290
We are envious of what we don't have.
((Just like you, Chang-min…))

230
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,350
We are envious of what we don't have.

231
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,360
Right?

232
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,010
(Blushing)

233
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,450
(Clatter)

234
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,640
Thanks.

235
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:20,450
(The first tense meal)

236
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,570
You ordered Italian baked rice?

237
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,360
Yes.

238
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,260
Do you like greasy food?

239
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,870
I like cream and things like that.

240
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,010
-Really?
-I love cheese.

241
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,740
Well then, before I eat it.

242
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,470
Try some.

243
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,190
Try some.

244
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,370
(Heart fluttering)

245
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:41,570
-Would you like to try my food?
-I'm good.
(Heart fluttering)

246
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,210
-Would you like to try my food?
-I'm good.

247
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,570
-I'm good.
-Yeah?

248
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,800
-You don't like cream?
-No, I don't.

249
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,390
(Blushing)

250
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:47,570
I can't eat much greasy food.
(Blushing)

251
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,600
I can't eat much greasy food.

252
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,260
(Ears turning red)

253
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,020
If I get nervous,
(Ears turning red)

254
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,450
my ears turn red before my face do.
(Ears turning red)

255
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,410
my ears turn red before my face do.

256
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,270
They just stand out.

257
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:03,450
(Can't hide feelings)

258
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,740
Have you met a lot of people?

259
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,610
For what purpose? To find a partner?

260
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,290
Yes.

261
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,840
I didn't go on a lot of dates.

262
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,430
(Nod, nod)

263
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,650
I usually hang out with friends.
(Nod, nod)

264
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,050
I usually hang out with friends.

265
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:21,050
Can I ask you a question?

266
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,230
(Cautiously)
Can I ask you a question?

267
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,770
(Cautiously)

268
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:22,970
When was the last time you were in a relationship?
(Cautiously)

269
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,690
When was the last time you were in a relationship?

270
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,940
About a year ago.

271
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,720
But it didn't last long.

272
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,860
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

273
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,970
For me, it's two years ago.

274
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,970
For how long?

275
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,890
Almost a year.

276
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,070
-A year?
-Yes.

277
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,490
That's a serious relationship.

278
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,350
I only do long relationships.

279
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,250
So I'm pretty serious about my relationship.

280
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,400
I don't like to waste

281
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:55,330
my feelings and time on short relationships.

282
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,490
So I'm serious.

283
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,480
You came to this show to find a long-term relationship.

284
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,630
Try looking for one here.

285
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,700
Yes.

286
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,250
Or maybe because it's a show, there's no long-term relationship here.

287
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,010
(Blushing)

288
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:16,330
(Although it's their first-time meeting, they can't stop talking)

289
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,170
(S Café)

290
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,850
(Nervous and excited)

291
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,410
(Who is Jeong-hyeon's date?)

292
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,490
(The man who finally showed up after the long wait!)

293
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,230
-Hello.
-Hello.

294
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,730
Hello.

295
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,880
-I chose this place.
-Really?

296
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,530
(Blushing)

297
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,530
(Peeking)

298
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,850
You chose here.

299
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,590
Should we flip it?

300
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,100
He's pretty.

301
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,640
How can I present myself better?

302
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,970
This is awkward.

303
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,870
I was so nervous.

304
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,310
I didn't know how to start a conversation.

305
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,260
What's your name?

306
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,900
I'm Lee Jeong-hyeon.

307
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,850
-Lee Jeong-hyeon.
-Yeah.

308
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,830
What's your name, brother?

309
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,290
I'm Kim Chan-gyu.

310
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,430
Sure, brother.

311
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,880
Why do you call me brother?

312
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,780
I just feel like…

313
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,660
Sorry.

314
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,290
It's OK.

315
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:26,990
Let's talk like friends.

316
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,500
You don't have to be so formal.

317
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,100
Brother makes me

318
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,090
sound really old.

319
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:34,880
No.

320
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,530
My face looks older than yours.

321
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,050
(Thanks to Jeong-hyeon's joke, the atmosphere is lighter)

322
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,170
(Peeking)

323
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,210
Our drinks are ready.

324
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,780
I'll get them.

325
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,090
Thanks.

326
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,900
So small.

327
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,830
What is this?

328
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,609
This is mine.

329
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,260
Because I like strawberries.

330
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,520
Do you have a favorite fruit, Senior?

331
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,980
There's nothing I don't like.

332
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,349
There's nothing I don't like.

333
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,170
What if you have to choose?

334
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,990
(Hesitating)

335
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,170
Fruit.
(Hesitating)

336
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:20,810
(Fruit…? Thinking)
Fruit.

337
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:21,650
(Fruit…? Thinking)

338
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:23,569
(Secretly)

339
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:24,470
Thanks.
(Secretly)

340
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,270
Fruit.

341
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,880
It's OK if you don't have one.

342
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,680
I should have.

343
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,210
(Awkward)

344
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,570
(The conversation that paused, stirring drink)

345
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,530
((Gulp))

346
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,510
What kind of relationship do you like, Senior?

347
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,040
Like what kind of things you want your boyfriend to do?

348
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,210
(Curious)

349
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,030
He should care about me, not just his job.

350
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:56,970
Clingy.

351
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,970
-No.
-Not that clingy?

352
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,170
-Clingy is better than nothing.

353
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,020
It doesn't matter if I can't reach him when he's working.

354
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,220
I won't interfere in his work.

355
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,360
Aside from that, I hope he cares more about me.

356
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,120
Someone who takes good care of me.

357
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,270
I would take care of him, too.

358
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,330
Something like give and take.

359
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,240
I know what you mean.

360
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,380
What kind of relationship do you like?

361
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,110
I want to have some personal time.

362
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:34,770
Personal time.

363
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,130
(Uh...)
Personal time.

364
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,150
In other words, I need to be free.

365
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,570
I'm a man of my own.

366
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,930
When I can't reach him,

367
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,330
I should be able to take care of myself.

368
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,790
(Two opposite ways of enjoying a relationship)

369
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,040
Why can't I be like you?
(Two opposite ways of enjoying a relationship)

370
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,730
(Are we able to get close?)

371
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,290
What do you like to do on a date?

372
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,130
(Uh...)

373
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,310
I like to go to a café.

374
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,150
Have a rest in a café.

375
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,730
I've never looked for a nice café since I was born.

376
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:15,930
How could that happen?

377
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:16,840
(Unbelievable)
How could that happen?

378
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,530
(Unbelievable)

379
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:22,250
It doesn't matter what I do with my partner.

380
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,270
We would focus on each other.

381
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,230
What do you think is important?

382
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,150
I think it's better if we could

383
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,150
do something memorable.

384
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,970
(Conversation stops once again)

385
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,370
When we're talking, it's important to me

386
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,650
that we hit it off.

387
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,020
But we got nothing to talk about.

388
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,030
It made me feel like I was talking to myself.

389
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,450
And I felt like he was not interested in me.

390
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:56,240
He was the opposite of me in almost everything.

391
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,190
It's unbelievable.

392
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,920
We have nothing in common.

393
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,570
I think it's quite fascinating.

394
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,290
(Can they be closer?)

395
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,690
(After the first date…)

396
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,490
(Back to the men's house)

397
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:18,810
(Jeong-hyeon and Chan-gyu got back first)

398
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,050
So neat.

399
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,970
(Found something!)

400
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,320
We don't have to choose now, right?

401
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,850
(Suspicious cards on the table)

402
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,930
(What tasks are awaiting them?)

403
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,460
I'll sit in the corner.

404
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:41,930
Will I be the only one sitting in the middle?

405
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,530
(Awkward)

406
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,570
(Awkward 2)

407
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:55,650
(No conversation, just two men in silence)

408
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,430
They are late.

409
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,270
(Eun-chan and Seon-yul are the second to arrive)

410
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,370
I was nervous.
(Eun-chan and Seon-yul are the second to arrive)

411
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,510
I was nervous.

412
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,910
I kept wondering what kind of people I was going to meet.

413
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,330
(Happy)

414
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,330
(Excited Curious)

415
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,850
Hello.

416
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:19,890
Hello.

417
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,770
Hello.

418
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:21,580
Hello.

419
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,810
Where shall I sit?

420
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,870
In the middle.

421
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,040
I'll sit here.

422
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,370
(Eun-chan chooses to sit next to Jeong-hyeon)

423
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,660
Did you two go on a date?

424
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,430
-Yes.
-You two went on a date.

425
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,670
They look like idols.

426
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:42,840
Yeah.

427
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,310
I want to go home.

428
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,550
When I went in, Jeong-hyeon
and Chan-gyu were there,

429
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,160
looking like idols.

430
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,690
They're slim with small faces.

431
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:53,130
(Pressure)

432
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,930
I was a little discouraged.
(Pressure)

433
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,470
Can I sit at the end?

434
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,310
Come here.

435
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,380
Why am I sitting in the middle?

436
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,610
Come here, why stay there?

437
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:02,810
(Hesitating)
Come here, why stay there?

438
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:03,570
(Hesitating)

439
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:04,880
I have to move.

440
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:05,990
Come on.

441
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:09,810
(Eun-chan chooses to sit next to Seon-yul)

442
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,650
(Awkward)

443

(Two of are coming with excited smiles)

444
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:28,850
(Chang-min and Hyeok-jun arrive last)

445
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,970
((Who is coming?))

446
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:39,280
(The last two men return to the men's house)

447
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,240
Hello.
(The last two men return to the men's house)

448
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,170
(Happy)

449
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,890
(Staring)

450
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:52,350
He looks like an actor.

451
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:53,810
Well…

452
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:54,770
(Too touched to say a word)
Well…

453
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,470
His face is so pretty.

454
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,100
I'm right in the middle.

455
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,900
-They are sitting far away.
-Come closer.

456
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,450
(Heart fluttering)

457
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,690
Hello.
(Heart fluttering)

458
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:06,490
A lot of people. They all feel different.

459
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,090
(Nervous)
A lot of people. They all feel different.

460
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,440
A lot of people. They all feel different.

461
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,000
They all look like nice guys.

462
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:15,170
Very good-looking.

463
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,240
(Six men who finally got all together)

464
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,010
Thanks.
(Six men who finally got all together)

465
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:18,020
(Six men who finally got all together)

466
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,820
Is everyone here?
(Six men who finally got all together)

467
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,330
(Six men who finally got all together)

468
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,560
What do we do now?

469
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,880
Are we supposed to draw this?

470
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,760
After you.

471
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,930
(Curious)

472
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,140
Among the six men,

473
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,460
are you curious about whom you'll be sharing a room with?

474
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,100
When all six of you are present, pick one from the six cards

475
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,780
to find out your room and roommate.

476
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,960
Who first then?

477
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,320
Start from there.

478
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,230
Over there.

479
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,640
Like this.

480
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:53,920
Nice.

481
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:54,770
Senior, you might feel it's unfair.

482
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,000
(Final Order Senior, you might feel it's unfair.)
Senior, you might feel it's unfair.

483
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,170
You keep calling me Senior.
(Final Order Senior, you might feel it's unfair.)
Senior, you might feel it's unfair.

484
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,080
You keep calling me Senior.

485
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,340
Well…

486
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,280
You might feel it's not fair.

487
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:00,910
Where are you from, Senior?

488
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,110
How do you know I'm older than you?

489
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,090
From my look?

490
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,110
(Awkward smile)
From my look?

491
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,090
(Awkward smile)

492
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:06,290
Can I say that?
(Awkward smile)

493
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,270
Can I say that?

494
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,940
I thought Jeong-hyeon was…

495
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,580
The villain.

496
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,580
Gosh. That's bad.

497
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,430
The shooting is going to be hard.

498
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,650
Well, first of all…

499
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,000
(Hahaha)
Well, first of all…

500
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,130
I felt like I was the youngest here
(Hahaha)
Well, first of all…

501
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,320
I felt like I was the youngest here

502
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,270
because I'm used to calling people Senior.

503
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,610
I immediately call him Senior whenever I see a stranger. It's like my reflex.

504
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,220
And you, Senior?

505
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:32,010
Can't we punish him for saying that?

506

You don't even know my age…

507
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,420
Then how?

508
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:34,450
How do we call each other?

How do we call each other?

510
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,830
Name. Just name.

00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,580
Name?

512
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,580
Just you, I and he, like that.

513
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,710

00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,560
Today I'll make

819
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,790
Bossam and Spicy Whelk.

820
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:42,910
I love Korean food.

821
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,210
I really like Bossam.

822
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,570
(My type)
I really like Bossam.

823
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,200
(Lucky)

824
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:49,660
I'm most confident in and also best at Korean food.

825
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:53,990
I need to show them I'm a good cook.

826
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,070
I'm very confident.

827
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:59,930
(Seon-yul prepares their first dinner with confidence)

828
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,120
Do you need help?

829
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,980
Plate presentation?

830
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,360
(Chang-min presenting the plate by his side)

831
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,700
(Everybody preparing dinner together)

832
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,660
Chopsticks.
(Everybody preparing dinner together)

833
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:15,440
Is there any kind of date you want to have here?

834
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,120
Date?

835
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,510
Everyone's eyes lit up all of a sudden.

836
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:20,480
What about you, Seon-yul?

837
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,160
(Interested)
What about you, Seon-yul?

838
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,600
I've never watched flowers with my date.

839
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:27,150
(Nods)

840
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,120
So I want to do that.
(Nods)

841
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,690
And you, Hyeok-jun?

842
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,440
I want to go camping.

843
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,870
-Camping?
-Camping.

844
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:35,080
-And make barbecue.
-Camping is good.

845
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,450
With fire and everything.

846
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,970
I think that's interesting.

847
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,290
Well, I want to do that.

848
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,890
Isn't there a balcony up there?

849
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:42,370
I just went up there

850
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,710
(Concentrated)
I just went up there

851
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,530
and the wind is so nice.
(Concentrated)

852
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,710
and the wind is so nice.

853
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:49,340
I want to have a chat with the wind blowing.

854
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,790
-With a beer?
-Sounds nice.

855
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:51,430
That's right.

856
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,330
The wind is so cool.

857
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,330
Then you need to go at night.

858
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,790
It's better at night. But still nice whenever.

859
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:02,190
I really like that, talking with the wind in our faces.

860
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,530
(Resonates)

861
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:10,930
(Seon-yul's dinner is about to be done while they getting to know each other)

862
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,620
Okay, it's done.

863
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:14,950
Wow. Finally.

864
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,520
You've worked so hard.

865
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,880
Kept you guys waiting.

866
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,110
There's so much food.

867
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,990
Want a drink? Wine?

868
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,100
Yeah, thanks.

869
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,300
I want wine too.

870
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,810
(Seon-yul prepared the wine by himself to go with Korean food)

871
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:38,330
He has big hands.

872
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,610
(Wine glasses all in one hand)
He has big hands.

873
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,410
Did you prepare it all by yourself?

874
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,210
Yeah.

875
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:47,180
This wine goes really well with Korean food like Bossam.

876
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,360
So I thought it'd be nice.

877
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,360
You are so considerate.

878
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,510
I'm touched.

879
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:53,990
Very thoughtful.

880
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:59,250
(Considerate Seon-yul)

881
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,080
For our encounter, cheers.

882
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,510
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

883
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,560
Thank you.

884
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,130
It's good.

885
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,280
Not too strong, right?

886
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:12,180
(Very satisfied)

887
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,070
The wine is good.
(Very satisfied)

888
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:13,970
-Bon appetit.
-Bon appetit.

889
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,470
(Their first meal together)
-Bon appetit.
-Bon appetit.

890
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:15,570
Enjoy your dinner.
(Their first meal together)
-Bon appetit.
-Bon appetit.

891
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,640
Enjoy your dinner.

892
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,780
The meat is very good.

893
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,810
(Delicious)

894
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,490
(Gratified)

895
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,370
What was your first impression of each other when you first met?

896
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,850
Yeah, I want to know that.

897
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,640
Who was here first?

898
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:37,530
How did you feel when the two of them came?

899
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,320
(Seon-yul (Chang-min & Hyeok-jun）How did you feel when the two of them came?)
How did you feel when the two of them came?

900
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,610
(The first impression of Chang-min and Hyeok-jun who came last?)

901
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,130
(Chan-gyu (Chang-min has) Nice perfume.)
Nice perfume.

902
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,050
Ivy style suits you well.

903
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,680
(Chan-gyu (Hyeok-jun's) Ivy style suits you well.)
Ivy style suits you well.

904
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,130
(Chan-gyu (Hyeok-jun's) Ivy style suits you well.)

905
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,680
Very explicit, I see.

906
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,120
Yeah.

907
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,680
When I heard first impression,

908
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,050
I don't know about other guys,

909
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,230
-but I had a few thoughts about you.
-What was it?

910
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,490
You have home shopping host vibes.

911
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,450
(Interesting)

912
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,640
Yeah, home shopping host.

913
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,050
It feels like your job requires you to talk.

914
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,450
I'm more and more curious.

915
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,010
(Seon-yul is curious about Hyeok-jun
A signal of attention?)

916
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,210
Really curious.
(Seon-yul is curious about Hyeok-jun
A signal of attention?)

917
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,170
(Seon-yul is curious about Hyeok-jun
A signal of attention?)

918
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,140
How is this?

919
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,760
I have to say this

920
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,330
because we have perilla leaves here.

921
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:19,550
I don't even know why it is so controversial.

922
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,330
Right?

923
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,900
If I were that friend,

924
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,050
I'd probably take it out for them

925
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,450
(Listens)
I'd probably take it out for them

926
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,090
before my partner does.

927
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:29,070
Let me help you. I'll just do it while saying this.

928
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,570
What do you think?

929
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,610
Taking out perilla leaves for people?

930
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:34,850
(Curious)

931
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,080
I think this is fine.

932
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:36,880
(Nods)

933
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,900
This is fine.
(Nods)

934
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,290
But you can't put it on there.

935
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,890
Good point.

936
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,150
And you, Chan-gyu?

937
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,360
Me too. It's okay if he removes it for them.

938
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,170
But it will upset me if he serves them food.

939
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:46,410
It's unacceptable.

940
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,770
(Gets angry)
It's unacceptable.

941
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:47,970
Yeah.
(Gets angry)
It's unacceptable.

942
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:48,590
Yeah.

943
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,090
I'll take it away like that.

944
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,110
(Time to know each other and get close)
I'll take it away like that.

945
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,810
(Time to know each other and get close)

946
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:54,720
I'm full.

947
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,910
It's really delicious.

948
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,310
I really enjoyed the meal.

949
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:04,210
(Who are the men yearning for?)

950
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,640
We can't change roommates, can we?

951
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,970
Do you want to?

952
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:09,920
No. No.

953
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,260
I'm not sure.

954
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,330
Maybe I'll feel lonely.

955
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:18,970
We're satisfied, right?

956
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,360
(Secretly)
We're satisfied, right?

957
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,670
I'm okay.

958
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,720
I don't think so.

959
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:25,610
(Joking)

960
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:28,390
Are we going to express our true feelings so soon?

961
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,450
Of course not yet.

962
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:44,490
(Can't understand it yet.)

963
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:49,250
(Roommates Single Room Eun-chan Double Room Seon-yul Hyeok-jun
Triple Room Chang-min Chan-gyu Jeong-hyeon)

964
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:54,450
Has anyone of us found the one he likes?

965
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:55,930
Just say yes or no.

966
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,190
Can we say no?

967
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,840
-No?
-Yes.

968
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,110
Since it's still the first day.

969
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:01,810
So...

970
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,420
Don't say no.

971
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,040
We just need a little more time.

972
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,250
Then that's a no.

973
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,020
That's clearly a no.

974
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,070
I don't know it yet.

975
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:14,890
(A heart fluttering and tense day is over)

976
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:15,970
Bye-bye.

977
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,190

Bye-bye.

(It's time to express feelings over the phone)

979

00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,310
They'll make the call in the middle of the night.

981
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,930
Each can call one man and talk for 30 seconds.

982
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:33,510
Who will they call?

983
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:38,370
(The three men get back to their triple room)

984
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,030
Oh, it's beautiful.

985
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,950
At this moment

986
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,410
(Sniffs)

987
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:49,490
(Sprays)

00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,610
(#sweet-smelling_man)

989
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:51,650
I'm not sure about my love...
(#sweet-smelling_man)

990
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:52,050
I'm not sure about my love...

991
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:55,770
(Chang-min is in a good mood)
I'm not sure about my love...

992
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,010
I'm not sure about my love...

993
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,810
(Plop)
I'm not sure about my love...

994
00:41:58,810 --> 00:41:59,850
I'm not sure about my love...

995
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,450
(Effortlessly)
I'm not sure about my love...

996
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:01,930
I'm not sure about my love...

997
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:04,650
(Comfortable #Unbothered_man)
I'm not sure about my love...

998
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:04,960
I'm not sure about my love...

999
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,850
(Jeong-hyeon is washing his face. The guys spend the night according to their own style.)
I'm not sure about my love...

1000
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:07,850
(Jeong-hyeon is washing his face. The guys spend the night according to their own style.)

1001
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,640
Isn't it good to live alone?

1002
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,730
Have a good time.

1003
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:19,090
(Eun-chan heads to the single room)

1004
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:23,600
(A net)

1005
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,490
It's dangerous.
(A net)

1006
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:25,750
I'm curious.
(A net)

1007
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,440
(A net)

1008
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,510
-Will I fall?
-Have a try.
(A net)

1009
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,370
(A net)

1010
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,350
Can I?
(A net)

1011
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,250
(A net)

1012
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,490
(Carefully)

1013
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:33,970
I don't think so.

1014
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,540
(Scary~)
I don't think so.

1015
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:35,730
I'll probably fall.
(Scary~)
I don't think so.

1016
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:36,720
I'll probably fall.

1017
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,030
Now it makes me feel at home.

1018
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,100
-Really, in here?
-Yeah.

1019
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,930
You actually brought wine, seriously?

1020
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:47,210
I put much thought into it.

1021
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,370
(Stealthily)
I put much thought into it.

1022
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:49,050
(Stealthily)

1023
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,250
(Suddenly)

1024
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:52,640
-I'm going crazy.
-Why?

1025
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,480
Because I'm bored...

1026
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:53,850
Then stay with us.

1027
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:54,700
(Kindly)
Then stay with us.

1028
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,650
(Kindly)

1029
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,390
The single room isn't fun.

1030
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:00,860
-I'll be bored if I were you.
-It's so boring.

1031
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:01,570
It really is.

1032
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:02,510
(Plop)
It really is.

1033
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:03,970
(Plop)

1034
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,290
-I'll curl up and sleep here.
-OK.

1035
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,070
Just give me a pillow.

1036
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:09,570
I might step on you when I go to the bathroom.

1037
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:10,520
(Joking)
I might step on you when I go to the bathroom.

1038
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,370
(Joking)

1039
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:12,170
I'm sorry.

1040
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:12,200
(Joking)
I'm sorry.

1041
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,590
Like a carpet.
(Joking)

1042
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:16,930
Do we really have to make the call?

1043
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:18,760
Yeah, I think so.

1044
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,290
What shall I do?

1045
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:19,720
(Already nervous)
What shall I do?

1046
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,980
(Already nervous)

1047
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:21,050
Seriously,
(Already nervous)

1048
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,080
Seriously,

1049
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,560
what if everyone doesn't have someone they're interested in?

1050
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,380
Then...

1051
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:29,850
You don't have one?

1052
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:31,080
-I can't tell you.
-Why?

1053
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,970
(Alert)
-I can't tell you.
-Why?

1054
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:34,770
Do you have one?

1055
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,870
Yeah.

1056
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:38,770
I have someone to call.

1057
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,370
Because it's not a deep relationship yet...

1058
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:41,740
(Now it's the stage to get acquainted with each other...)
Because it's not a deep relationship yet...

1059
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,150
Because we don't have to start a relationship now.
(Now it's the stage to get acquainted with each other...)

1060
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,300
Then I have someone too.

1061
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,670
Make the choice by your first impressions.

1062
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:48,720
If we're both here,

1063
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,610
and one of us gets a call...

1064
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:50,680
(Embarrassed)
and one of us gets a call...

1065
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,240
(Embarrassed)

1066
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:51,730
It will be a problem.
(Embarrassed)

1067
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:52,510
It will be a problem.

1068
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:53,790
I'll cover my ears.

1069
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,370
You may get a call too.

1070
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:56,890
(4. You only have 30 seconds to express your feelings to the person you like by phone at a specified time.)

1071
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:57,710
Then I'll cover my ears.
(4. You only have 30 seconds to express your feelings to the person you like by phone at a specified time.)

1072
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:58,480
(4. You only have 30 seconds to express your feelings to the person you like by phone at a specified time.)

1073
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,780
I mean, isn't it embarrassing if the guys who share a room
(4. You only have 30 seconds to express your feelings to the person you like by phone at a specified time.)

1074
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,410
-has to call each other?
-Exactly.
(4. You only have 30 seconds to express your feelings to the person you like by phone at a specified time.)

1075
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:03,620
I can't do that.

1076
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:04,770
You have to.

1077
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:06,150
We have to bear it.

1078
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:11,610
(A night full of expectations and tension)

1079
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:16,090
(Eun-chan gets back after talking with Seon-yul and Hyeok-jun)

1080
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:17,810
-I'm curious about everyone's age.
-Yeah.

1081
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:20,770
(Hyeok-jun: I'm curious about everyone's age. Seon-yul: Yeah.)
-I'm curious about everyone's age.
-Yeah.

1082
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:20,850
Maybe I'm the eldest.
(Hyeok-jun: I'm curious about everyone's age. Seon-yul: Yeah.)
-I'm curious about everyone's age.
-Yeah.

1083
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:22,190
Maybe I'm the eldest.

1084
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,410
We've got the message, right?

1085
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:30,970
I don't remember.

1086
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:32,010
Yeah, it happened.

1087
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,080
Why does it say?

1088
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:34,650
It's time to make the call.

1089
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:37,490
(Phone time begins. Express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds)
It's time to make the call.

1090
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:39,580
(Phone time begins. Express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds)

1091
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,550
It's time to make the call.
(Phone time begins. Express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds)

1092
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:42,130
(Phone time begins. Express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds)

1093
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:43,710
My heart is racing.

1094
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:46,210
How do we know

1095
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:47,440
who should go make the call...

1096
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:50,800
They may ask us to do it in order.

1097
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,220
I mean, how do we do it?

1098
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:57,770
I really envy the guy that owns the single room.

1099
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:59,630
-Yeah.
-Yeah, right.

1100
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:03,490
(This moment, at the single room...)

1101
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:09,090
(Have difficulty in breathing-)

1102
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:15,130
(Eun-chan, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds.)

1103
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:16,970
(Ah- Eun-chan, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds.)

1104
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:27,170
(Eun-chan heads to the phone booth with his heart thumping)

1105
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:33,670
(Who is Eun-chan calling?)

1106
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:33,890
His looks is my ideal type.
(Who is Eun-chan calling?)

1107
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:37,090
His looks is my ideal type.

1108
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,780
Actually, everyone would think he's good looking.

1109
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:49,770
(Nervous hesitant)

1110
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:54,080
I don't know how to hide my feelings.

1111
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:59,130
(Of the six men, who would Eun-chan call?)

1112
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:04,010
(Hyeok-jun who listened to me carefully during dinner?)

1113
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:08,410
(Jeong-hyeon who sat next to me at the first meeting?)

1114
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:09,610
Try this.

1115
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:09,900
(Seon-yul who had the first date with me?)
Try this.

1116
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,110
(Seon-yul who had the first date with me?)

1117
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,010
Try this.
(Seon-yul who had the first date with me?)

1118
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,010
(Seon-yul who had the first date with me?)

1119
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,400
Hello?

1120
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:21,730
Hello?

1121
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,170
Hello?

1122
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,370
Hello.

1123
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:26,620
Yeah, I can hear you.

1124
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:29,170
(Nervous)

1125
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:33,190
30 seconds is enough.

1126
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:37,100
But I can't recognize you by your voice.

1127
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,570
Really?

1128
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,280
Oh, hang on.

1129
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:43,380
('Hyeok-jun' got Eun-chan's call)

1130
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:43,450
Could you talk more?
('Hyeok-jun' got Eun-chan's call)

1131
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:44,650
Could you talk more?

1132
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,800
It's my first time...

1133
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:50,990
(Click)

1134
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:51,680
OK.
(Click)

1135
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:53,590
OK.

1136
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:57,450
(Despair)

1137
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,640
Time is up.

1138
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:00,910
(30 seconds is too short to say all the things you want to)

1139
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:02,420
It hung up.
(30 seconds is too short to say all the things you want to)

1140
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:04,890
(Oh?)

1141
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,320
It's exactly 30 seconds.

1142
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:09,890
-I...
-What's going on?

1143
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:10,430
(More and more nervous)
-I...
-What's going on?

1144
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,260
It was over just when he started talking.
(More and more nervous)

1145
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:15,480
It's so hard. I couldn't recognize his voice.

1146
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:17,650
I thought it was a wrong call.

1147
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:20,210
To be honest, I didn't have any expectations.

1148
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:20,800
(Hyeok-jun: But I'm really glad (when I got the call).)

1149
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,180
But I'm really glad.
(Hyeok-jun: But I'm really glad (when I got the call).)

1150
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:22,650
(Hyeok-jun: But I'm really glad (when I got the call).)

1151
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,550
The time is too short.

1152
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,290
He didn't recognize my voice

1153
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:28,550
before the phone was hung up.

1154
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:33,130
(Watches silently)

1155
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,370
Get on the bed. Why do you sit on the floor?

1156
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:36,190
(Chang-min kindly asks Chan-gyu to get on the bed)
Get on the bed. Why do you sit on the floor?

1157
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:36,830
(Chang-min kindly asks Chan-gyu to get on the bed)

1158
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:38,430
You make us feel sorry.
(Chang-min kindly asks Chan-gyu to get on the bed)

1159
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:39,730
(Chang-min kindly asks Chan-gyu to get on the bed)

1160
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:45,930
It's comfortable to lie in bed.

1161
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:49,440
What's it?

1162
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,010
Only you got the message.

1163
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:52,530
Right?

1164
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:53,140
(Chan-gyu, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds.)
Right?

1165
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,150
(Chan-gyu, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds.)

1166
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:55,720
-We didn't receive anything.
-Right?
(Chan-gyu, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds.)

1167
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,000
(Chan-gyu, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds.)

1168
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:59,210
-Go ahead.
-Bye.

1169
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,440
What's that?

1170
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:06,130
(Chan-gyu seems to be thinking)

1171
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:10,730
(Chan-gyu tramps heavily towards the phone booth)

1172
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:13,020
I never thought that I would have to make the call.

1173
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:13,720
Yeah.

1174
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:19,210
(Who will Chan-gyu call?)

1175
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,870
Have you decided who you would call?

1176
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,810
-Me?
-Get prepared.

1177
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,560
I have a few options.

1178
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,710
A few?

1179
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,730
Honestly, I don't know yet.

1180
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,060
I should be sure tomorrow.

1181
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,000
Tomorrow?

1182
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:47,170
I just got to know them by their appearances today.

1183
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:52,450
(Chan-gyu finally gets in the booth)

1184
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:56,050
(Struggles to pick up the phone)

1185
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,530
I dare not make the call.

1186
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:05,410
(Who is the man that makes Chan-gyu hesitate?)

1187
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:10,490
(First date, Jeong-hyeon?)

1188
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:10,890
-Let me help you.
-Thanks.
(First date, Jeong-hyeon?)

1189

1190
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:12,180

(The nice roommate, Chang-min?)

1192
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:21,610
(And...)

1193
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:25,410
((Relaxed after the phone call))

1194
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:29,770
(Whose number did Chan-gyu get through to?)

1195
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:31,280
Hello?

1196
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:33,530
(Yeah!?)

1197
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:37,560
Honestly.

1198
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:39,170
(Surprised)

1199
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:42,310
It's you.

1200
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:49,800
(Chan-gyu calls Chang-min, who shares a bed with him)

1201
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,880
Do I have to pick it up? What shall I do?

1202
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:54,250
I'd better go out.

1203
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,860
No, don't go. Stay.

1204
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,630
Hello?

1205
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:05,180
I just want to say, we can look after each other in the week to come.

1206
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,440
Thank you for calling me.

1207
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:07,890
Yeah. I'll hang up then.

1208
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:11,110

I see.

1213
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:19,280
(Chan-gyu felt shy and hung up in advance)

1214
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,100
Seriously?
(Chan-gyu felt shy and hung up in advance)

1215
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:24,170
We have to share a room in the coming week.

Is this how we do it?
(Express feelings unreservedly on the phone)

1224
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:35,290
Is 30 seconds so short?

1225
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:41,490
(Embarrassed)

1226
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:42,370
Did you hear?

We share a room after all.
(Feels reluctant to face his roommates)

1238
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,170
They saw me going out to make the call.

1239
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:16,890
I kept telling myself it's okay. I need some time to calm down.

1240
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:27,050
(A few minutes later, Chan-gyu returns to his room)

1241

It's driving me crazy.

1247
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:43,290
Why do we have to do this when we share a room?

(Chang-min covers his face with the quilt out of embarrassment)

1282
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,810
Hello?

1283
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:31,010
You made a favorable first impression on me.

1284
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,710
Thanks.

1285
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,550
Let's try to get along.

1286
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:39,750
Thanks.

1287
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:41,500
Have a nice evening.

1288
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,750
-You too.
-Yeah.

1289
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:56,040
I couldn't recognize his voice.

1290
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:58,370
His voice seemed to have changed.

1291
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:01,290
(Finds it interesting)
His voice seemed to have changed.

1292
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:02,650
(Finds it interesting)

1293
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:06,320
It's a real pain.

1294
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:09,430
I called Chang-min.

1295
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,840
I considered Hyeok-jun and him.

1296
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,090
-Have you finished the call already?
-Yeah.

1297
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:17,580
You're fast.

1298
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:21,650
Go ahead.

1299
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:22,550
(Hyeok-jun, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds.)
Go ahead.

1300
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:25,730
(Hyeok-jun, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds.)

1301
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:32,090
(Mid-term check Eun-chan, Hyeok-jun, Chan-gyu, Chang-min, Seon-yul)

1302
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:41,490
(Hyeok-jun heads to the booth excitedly)

1303
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:50,570
(Who is the man that wins Hyeok-jun's heart?)

1304
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:56,610
(Chang-min who had the first date with him?)

1305
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:57,390
(Seon-yul the roommate?)

1306
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:58,610
We're satisfied, right?
(Seon-yul the roommate?)

1307
00:54:58,610 --> 00:54:58,770
(Seon-yul the roommate?)

1308
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:00,240
Yeah, it's quite nice.
(Seon-yul the roommate?)

1309
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,250
(Seon-yul the roommate?)

1310
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:04,240
(Anxious)

1311
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,920
Hello.

1312
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:08,650
Hello.

1313
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,740
I was pleased talking with you today.

1314
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:19,490
(Wow!)

1315
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,820
You're so popular.

1316
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:25,820
You can answer it outside.

1317
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:27,620
Could I do that?

1318
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,760
-It doesn't matter.
-It'll be okay.

1319
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:33,450
(Chang-min's phone has rung for the third time)

1320
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:34,920
(Chang-min dare not pick up the phone because of embarrassment and pressure.)

1321
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,490
It drives me crazy.
(Chang-min dare not pick up the phone because of embarrassment and pressure.)

1322
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:39,130
(Chang-min dare not pick up the phone because of embarrassment and pressure.)

1323
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:41,730
(The onlooker feels shy for him)

1324
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:42,870
Hello.

1325
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:44,670
Hello.

1326
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:46,670
Hello.

1327
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,680
I was pleased talking with you today.

1328
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:53,110
Sleep well.

1329
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:56,000
(Hyeok-jun hung up quickly)

1330
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:56,840
Hello?
(Hyeok-jun hung up quickly)

1331
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,120
(Hyeok-jun hung up quickly)

1332
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:58,130
Hello?
(Hyeok-jun hung up quickly)

1333
00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:59,060
Hello?

1334
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:02,080
Who was it?

1335
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,310
Actually,

1336
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,390
I was going to call Seon-yul or Chang-min.

1337
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:14,330
But I finally chose Chang-min in another room

1338
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:15,640
and called him.

1339
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:17,480
It's fun.

1340
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:19,970
It feels okay after you finished the call.

1341
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:21,520
No big deal.

1342
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,640
Yeah, no big deal.

1343
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:31,770
(Both of them chose Chang-min)

1344
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:41,050
(It's Jeong-hyeon's turn to make the call)

1345
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:59,650
(An embarrassed laughter)

1346
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:06,990
Hello.

1347
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:12,910
I call you because I want us to get close, Senior.

1348
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:16,810
(Who does Jeong-hyeon want to get close to?)

1349
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:21,330
(Chan-gyu who had the first date with him?)

1350
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:22,530
(Seon-yul who looks indifferent but is actually warm?)

1351
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:23,640
You are younger than me though.
(Seon-yul who looks indifferent but is actually warm?)

1352
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,490
(Seon-yul who looks indifferent but is actually warm?)

1353
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:28,170
(Chang-min the roommate?)

1354
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:36,270
Hello.

1355
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:41,270
I call you because I want us to get close, Senior.

1356
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,750
Thanks.

1357
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,530
Have a beautiful night.

1358
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:48,390
Yeah, you too.

1359
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:50,740
Yeah. Senior.

1360
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,320
Yeah. Senior.

1361
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:56,330
(Q, who does he like the most?)

1362
00:57:56,330 --> 00:57:57,510
There are two of them
(Q, who does he like the most?)

1363
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,520
I like the most.

1364
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:01,880
I was thinking who I should choose?

1365
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:05,440
In the end I called Seon-yul.

1366
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:09,380
Honestly, I wanted to call Chang-min.

1367
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,960
But we share a room,

1368
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:14,730
I don't want my feelings to be found out from the first day.

1369
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:17,510
I couldn't tell who it is at all.

1370
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:19,470
-So, I told you.
-Yes.

1371
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:24,510
It's good someone called you. Are you happy?

1372
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:26,500
But I'm a little confused.

1373
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,280
I wonder who it was.

1374
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:30,970
I thought I would recognize the voice on hearing it.

1375
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:32,750
But I couldn't.

1376
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,330
Well, I can have a good sleep now.

1377
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:41,050
It's really a mysterious place.

1378
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,610
But I remember he called me Senior.

1379
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:46,890
Did I make a mistake?

1380
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:47,290
(The men start to express their feelings for each other)
Did I make a mistake?

1381
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:51,970
(The men start to express their feelings for each other)

1382
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:56,570
(Jeong-hyeon returns after the call)

1383
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:58,780
Have you got the call?

1384
00:58:58,960 --> 00:58:59,600
What?

1385
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:01,120
You got it, didn't you?

1386
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,520
-No.
-No?

1387
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:03,230
(Chang-min thought Jeong-hyeon got a call)

1388
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:05,270
The atmosphere isn't right.
(Chang-min thought Jeong-hyeon got a call)

1389
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:06,890
(Chang-min thought Jeong-hyeon got a call)

1390
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:10,250
I'm so sleepy.

1391
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:11,350
((Chan-gyu is relaxed after the phone call))
I'm so sleepy.

1392
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:13,410
((Chan-gyu is relaxed after the phone call))

1393
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,170
(On tenterhooks)

1394
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:18,080
It's suffocating.

1395
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,530
It's your turn now, right?

1396
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:24,240
(Chang-min, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds.)

1397
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,130
I got the message.
(Chang-min, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds.)

1398
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:27,650
(Chang-min, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds.)

1399
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:32,020
Did you make the call?

1400
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:34,610
I won't tell you.

1401
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:37,480
Am I the last one?

1402
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:37,720
Did you do it?

1403
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,890
(Chang-min asked again: Did you do it (make a call)?)
Did you do it?

1404
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:39,000
(Jeong-hyeon lied on purpose: Not yet.)

1405
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:39,930
Not yet.
(Jeong-hyeon lied on purpose: Not yet.)

1406
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:40,930
(Jeong-hyeon lied on purpose: Not yet.)

1407
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:43,810
(Hee hee)

1408
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:48,180
After knowing we have to make the call,

1409
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,480
I've been thinking who I'm going to call.

1410
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:05,900
Calling someone means you have feelings for him.

1411
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:12,570
(After getting three calls himself, who would Chang-min call?)

1412
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:13,430
(Hyeok-jun who had the first date with him?)

1413
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:15,170
-I have two suitcases.
-Two?
(Hyeok-jun who had the first date with him?)

1414
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:16,110
(Hyeok-jun who had the first date with him?)

1415
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:18,170
What are you going to do? Travel abroad?
(Hyeok-jun who had the first date with him?)

1416
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:18,840
What are you going to do? Travel abroad?

1417
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:24,210
(Seon-yul who made the dinner?)

1418
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:33,530
(One of his roommates, Chan-gyu, or Jeong-hyeon?)

1419
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:40,690
(Which man would Chang-min call?)

1420
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:53,600
There's still blood.

1421
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,590
There's a way.

1422
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:03,060
Let's write this.

1423
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,060
Since I got a single room,

1424
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:08,780
(Writes down)

1425
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:10,830
I'd better write my own name.
(Writes down)

1426
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:12,300
-OK.
-Fine.

1427
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:16,720
The handwriting is kind of untrammeled.

1428
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:18,630
But it's elegant.

1429
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:19,800
What shall I write with?

1430
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,730
(Curious)

1431
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:28,240
Next one.

1432
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:30,300
It's neat.

1433
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,610
I feel the handwriting reflects everyone's personality.

1434
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:37,520
My personality is to be exposed.

1435
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:40,010
(Lefty)

1436
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:42,670
-Are you a lefty?
-Yeah.

1437
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:43,960
You should write with your feet.

1438
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:51,470
(Very vague)

1439
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:53,250
I can't see the name. What did you use to write that?
(Very vague)

1440
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:54,180
I can't see the name. What did you use to write that?

1441
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:55,610
What did you use?

1442
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:56,180
(Erases it)
What did you use?

1443
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,650
(Erases it)

1444
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:01,010
(Makes it bigger this time)

1445
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,160
Like a child.

1446
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:06,330
Do I have to write in the middle?

1447
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:12,050
He's surely a strong presence.

1448
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:12,170
(Very big)
He's surely a strong presence.

1449
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:13,360
(Very big)

1450
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,270
Surely.
(Very big)

1451
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:16,510
He's extraordinary.

1452
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:27,070
