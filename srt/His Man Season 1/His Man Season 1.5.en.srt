(Last episode, Eun-chan went home with flowers)

20
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,820
Where did you go?

21
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:11,940
I got flowers.

(When the guys are talking, the last man entered secretly)

29
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,640
Because at first, I was too curious.

30
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,000
So I am a little excited.

31

(Jeong-ho finally meets the guys from the "Men's House")

He is really handsome.

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,460
He doesn't look tall but you could feel his vibe.

42
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,720
(Still awkward now-)

43
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,200
What is your first impression of everyone?

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,670
My first impression?

45
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,460
Looks like you're a little nervous.

46
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,090
Nervous.

47
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,830
Honestly, I know Hyeon.

48
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,950
Do you have to say it?

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,650
(Nod)

So sudden?

53
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,039
You look like a deer. My first impression of you is deer.

54
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,560
Really, you are like Santa Claus's reindeer. It's great.

55
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,640
(Santa Claus's reindeer? Deer?)
Really, you are like Santa Claus's reindeer. It's great.

-Ah, deer.
-Deer.

60
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,350
I didn't know Chang-min,

61
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,650
but after he stood up, I found he was tall.

62
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,170
He looks like a model.

63
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:27,829
Thank you.

64
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,829

He drinks alone.

86
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:52,910
He drinks alone.

87
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:53,570
Today we meet for the first time, and there's beer.

(I didn't know there would be people coming)

92
00:02:57,329 --> 00:02:58,570
I didn't know there would be people coming, I mean it.
(I didn't know there would be people coming)

93
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,230
(I didn't know there would be people coming)

94
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,400
I regretted it immediately.

95
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,000
Why would I drink beer?

96
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,950
Hyeok-jun looks like an

97
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,330
elite student.

98
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,980
I'm impressed most

99
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,040
by Hyeok-jun and Chang-min.

100
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,760
The two of them are very handsome.

101
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,730
We have to decide who is going to be Jeong-ho's roommate.

102
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,390
Wait.

103
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,329
I have to get your response first, what's your first impression of me?

104
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,860
((Wow))

00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,730
Yeah, so smart.

106
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,880
(Anticipating)

107
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:40,250
(Chang-min: It's like there's a halo above your head.)

108
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,430
-It's like there is a halo above your head.
-Yeah.
(Chang-min: It's like there's a halo above your head.)

109
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,860
I want to be close to him.

110
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,579
Looks gorgeous, that kind of feeling.

111
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:51,510
(Hyeok-jun: Looks gorgeous...)
Looks gorgeous, that kind of feeling.

112
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,630
I also have to say my first impression of you, right?

113
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:54,630
Still very cute.

114
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,079
(Still very cute~ Haha)
Still very cute.

115
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:56,770
(Still very cute~ Haha)

116
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,150
((Get yourself together, Hyeon) Jeong-ho: Anyway, thank you...)

117
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,950
-Thank you.
-It's nothing.
((Get yourself together, Hyeon) Jeong-ho: Anyway, thank you...)

118
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,590
So handsome.

119
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,130
Thank you.

120
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:04,910
-The reactions of these two are so interesting.
-Yes.

121
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,300
(Eun-chan: Hyeon and Jeong-ho's reactions are so interesting.)
-The reactions of these two are so interesting.
-Yes.

122
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:06,830
(Eun-chan: Hyeon and Jeong-ho's reactions are so interesting.)

123
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,710
I seem to know what it means to be like-minded.

124
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:09,770
Yes, yes.

125
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,430
((Is that so?))

126
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:12,790
So our room is like...

127
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,160
(Hyeon: Ah! So, our room is like…)
So our room is like...

128
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,930
(Hyeon: Ah! So, our room is like…)

129
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,940
Eh? It becomes a quadra room now.

130
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,150
Just write your name on the blackboard with chalk.

131
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,100
The rooms are set now.

132
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,110
Several people use the same room.

133
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,159
It would be easier for them to get to know each other better.

134
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,900
But brother Jeong-ho

135
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,170
said he wanted roommates, that's just great.

136
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,490
He goes to the room with the most people.

137
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,710
He comes to the room with the most roommates.

138
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,040
You might be a little shocked after seeing the rooms.

139
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,030
You haven't seen the rooms yet?

140
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,080
No, I haven't.

141
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,580
Let us show you our rooms.

142
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,720
-Dormitory.
-You haven't looked around?

143
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,000
(You haven't looked around?)
-Dormitory.
-You haven't looked around?

145
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,230
(No!)
-No. No.

146
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:58,450
-Then let's show you around the dormitory.

147
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,890
(Chang-min: Let's show you around the dormitory.)
-Then let's show you around the dormitory.
-Yes!

148
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,450

-Let's show you around?
-Let's show you around.

OK.
(Go go)

155
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,290
OK.

156
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:03,650
(OK~)
OK.

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,410
(Seon-yul: The first impression...Got it, thank you.)
Thanks, first impression, okay.

451
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:31,780
(Seon-yul: The first impression...Got it, thank you.)

452
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,480
Thanks.
(Seon-yul: The first impression...Got it, thank you.)

453
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,450
(Seon-yul: The first impression...Got it, thank you.)

454
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,100
Okay, I see.

455
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,080
Then I'll hang up first.

456
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:37,750
Okay, thanks, see you later.

457
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,850
(Seon-yul: Okay, thanks, see you later.)
Okay, thanks, see you later.

458
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,690
Is that Jeong-ho?

459
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:44,470
(Hyeok-jun: Do you also think Jeong-ho is handsome?)

460
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,530
Do you also think Jeong-ho is handsome?
(Hyeok-jun: Do you also think Jeong-ho is handsome?)

461
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,620
(Hyeok-jun: Do you also think Jeong-ho is handsome?)

462
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:48,700
Yes, he is handsome, but we haven't had any chance to meet yet.
(Hyeok-jun: Do you also think Jeong-ho is handsome?)

463
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,010
Yes, he is handsome, but we haven't had any chance to meet yet.

464
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:57,270
Ah, it's over.

465
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,120
(Jeong-ho: Oh? Hung up?)
Ah, it's over.

466
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,520
((So shy~))

467
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:15,330
(Did Jeong-ho call the same man twice?)

468
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,910
(Chang-min)

469
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,250
Brother, did you call me?

470
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,430
(Nod)

471
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,520
I called Chang-min first for the first time,
(Nod)

472
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,780
I called Chang-min first for the first time,

473
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,380
but he didn't answer it.

474
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:30,930
I thought, oh you can get rejected too.

475
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,250
(Jeong-ho: (Misunderstanding) I thought, oh you can get rejected too.)
I thought, oh you can get rejected too.

476
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,670
(A few minutes ago)

477
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:36,840
(Jeong-ho: Ah! Why is he not picking up the phone call?)

478
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,240
Why is he not picking up the phone call?
(Jeong-ho: Ah! Why is he not picking up the phone call?)

479
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,760
(Jeong-ho: Ah! Why is he not picking up the phone call?)

480
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:52,050
(Chang-min's mobile phone did not receive the call due to a temporary signal problem)

481
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,400
(Jeong-ho thought Chang-min ignored his phone on purpose)

482
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,120
(Jeong-ho: I thought Chang-min “rejected” me, so I called Seon-yul.)

483
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,390
I thought Chang-min rejected me, so I called Seon-yul again.
(Jeong-ho: I thought Chang-min “rejected” me, so I called Seon-yul.)

484
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:01,820
Simply saying that I want to know him a little more.

485
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,780
(Jeong-ho just simply said to Seon-yul that he wanted to “know him a little more” ...)
Simply saying that I want to know him a little more.

486
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,340
I called Seon-yul then.

487
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:10,600
(Okay, okay~ Start packing bags again)

488
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,880
Okay, okay.
(Okay, okay~ Start packing bags again)

489
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,060
(Okay, okay~ Start packing bags again)

490
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,690
(Look around)

491
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:18,080
Come here.

492
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,550
(Hyeon: Come here.)
Come here.

493
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,540
(Hyeon: Come here.)

494
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,600
What? Jeong-hyeon came again.

495
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,030
Kind of.

496
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,040
(Phew... Eun-chan, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds.)

497
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,160
Brother is coming down.
(Phew... Eun-chan, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds.)

498
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,250
(Phew... Eun-chan, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds.)

499
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:34,900
What?
(Phew... Eun-chan, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds.)

500
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,000
(Phew... Eun-chan, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds.)

501
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,730
-Brother is coming down.
-I need to go.
(Phew... Eun-chan, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds.)

502
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:35,770
-Brother is coming down.
-I need to go.

503
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,360
(I need to go. Eun-chan, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds.)
-Brother is coming down.
-I need to go.

504
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:36,850
(I need to go. Eun-chan, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds.)

505
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:37,410
Really?
(I need to go. Eun-chan, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds.)

506
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,480
(Eun-chan and Hyeon came out of the room together)

507
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,390
(Stop)

508
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,720
((Why go there?))

509
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,660
(Eun-chan with many thoughts on his face)

510
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,640
(Who was Eun-Chan thinking about at the end of an exceptionally long day?)

511
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,270
(Thinking)

512
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,410
(Who did Eun-chan call?)

513
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,910
(The secret date Jeong-ho?)

514
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,950
(Hyeok-jun who he has a crush on from the start?)

515
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,610
Okay, I've got through.

516
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,900
-Brother.
-Yes.

517
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,090
Do you know who is this?

518
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,270
I know.

519
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,790
(Eun-Chan's choice remains the same, Hyeok-jun)

520
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,660
Do you know who is this?
(Eun-Chan's choice remains the same, Hyeok-jun)

521
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,220
(Eun-Chan's choice remains the same, Hyeok-jun)

522
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:47,790
I know.
(Eun-Chan's choice remains the same, Hyeok-jun)

523
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,640
(Eun-Chan's choice remains the same, Hyeok-jun)

524
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,350
Could you say something more to fill up the 30 seconds?

525
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,380
Pardon?

526
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,990
Please say something that you want to say to me.

527
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,650
What do you want to hear?

528
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:05,990
No, it's just...

529
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,320
-See you later.
-Okay.

530
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,940
-See you later.
-Okay.

531
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,950
(The phone call during which they couldn't say everything they want to say)

532
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,150
(Ever wonder who you should call?)

533
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,620
I didn't think at all.

534
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,930
My choice was him from the beginning.

535
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:36,070
(But Hyeok-jun, who has different feelings from Eun-Chan reacts like this)

536
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,330
I have some certain predictions,

537
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:49,530
but part of me wants to deny the truth.

538
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,920
(Eun-chan stumbled up the stairs)

539
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,660
How was the call?

540
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,970
I don't know.

541
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,080
Where was Hyeon when I called?

542
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,870
(Eun-chan: Where was Hyeon when I called?)
Where was Hyeon when I called?

543
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,380
(Eun-chan: Where was Hyeon when I called?)

544
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,250
In that room.
(Eun-chan: Where was Hyeon when I called?)

545
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:05,320
In that room.

546
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,240
(Jeong-hyeon: Hyeon was in that room?)
In that room.

547
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,570
(Jeong-hyeon: Hyeon was in that room?)

548
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:06,850
When I called? I saw that he had just been here.
(Jeong-hyeon: Hyeon was in that room?)

549
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:06,900
When I called? I saw that he had just been here.

550
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,920
(Eun-chan: Did he go to Hyeok-Jun's room when I called?)
When I called? I saw that he had just been here.

551
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,680
Really?

552
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,330
Really?

553
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,740
(Peek)

554
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,350
(Observe)

555
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,620
(Eun-chan entered the room listlessly)

556
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:37,490
(Upset...)

557
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,180
(The same time in the first-floor lounge)

558
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,050
Chan-gyu: What about we don't speak in honorifics?

559
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,320
OK, you can drop the honorifics.

560
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,860
Do you drop the honorifics with everyone else?

561
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,450
Everyone is older than me except Jeong-hyeon.

562
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:55,360
I usually use honorifics with people older than me.

563
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,760
-You don't need to speak in a very formal way.
-Okay.

564
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,130
Where is everyone?

565
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,960
They all left to answer the call.

566
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:03,690
-Yes.
-That's why.

567
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,940
(Bored)
-Yes.
-That's why.

568
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,770
(Bored)

569
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:13,250
(Chan-gyu, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds.)

570
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,970
(Bye Bye)

571
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:28,740
(Chan-gyu walks towards the phone booth without hesitation)

572
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,600
Just told me we were going somewhere out of the way.

573
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,420
(During the day Chan-gyu has confirmed with Seon-yul that they have different feelings)
Just told me we were going somewhere out of the way.

574
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:35,580
(During the day Chan-gyu has confirmed with Seon-yul that they have different feelings)

575
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,500
Talking to me out loud like this.
(During the day Chan-gyu has confirmed with Seon-yul that they have different feelings)

576
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:43,740
(The current feelings vs Other men)

577
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:51,320
(While standing in front of the phone, the feelings became complicated)

578
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,820
(After thinking, pick up the phone)

579
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:01,530
(Seon-yul? Chan-gyu expressed his feeling to him before.)

580
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:04,920
Talking to me out loud like this,
(Seon-yul? Chan-gyu expressed his feeling to him before.)

581
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,830
(Seon-yul? Chan-gyu expressed his feeling to him before.)

582
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,710
I think Chan-Gyu will lose points for that as well.
(Seon-yul? Chan-gyu expressed his feeling to him before.)

583
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,850
(Seon-yul? Chan-gyu expressed his feeling to him before.)

584
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:12,880
(The new man, Jeong-ho?)

585
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,510
Chan-gyu, how about we don't use honorifics, either?
(The new man, Jeong-ho?)

586
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:20,400
(The new man, Jeong-ho?)

587
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,330
Hello.

588
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,560
What are you doing?

589
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:28,810
Missing you, I guess?

590
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:29,590
(Missing you, I guess?)
Missing you, I guess?

591
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,620
(Missing you, I guess?)

592
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,350
You're gonna pull stuff like this now, huh?
(Missing you, I guess?)

593
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,270
You're gonna pull stuff like this now, huh?

594
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,420
I want to hear your voice, so I called you.

595
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,710
You're also gonna do that, uh.

596
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:43,150
(Phone ringing in the double room)

597
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,120
Hello.

598
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,240
(Seon-yul: Hello.)
Hello.

599
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:45,320
What are you doing?
(Seon-yul: Hello.)
Hello.

600
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,150
What are you doing?

601
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,310
(Chan-gyu chose Seon-yul, the man he is into now)

602
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:49,350
Missing you, I guess?
(Chan-gyu chose Seon-yul, the man he is into now)

603
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:49,440
Missing you, I guess?

604
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,200
(Joking Seon-yul: Missing you, I guess?)
Missing you, I guess?

605
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,810
(Joking Seon-yul: Missing you, I guess?)

606
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,820
You're gonna pull stuff like this, huh?

607
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,710
All right, I see. Thank you.

608
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,840
(Chan-gyu: Got it)
Got it.

609
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,330
(Chan-gyu: Got it)

610
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,520
(Well, Chan-gyu... Complicated)

611
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,060
Well, Chan-gyu...
(Well, Chan-gyu... Complicated)

612
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,600
(Well, Chan-gyu... Complicated)

613
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,330
He is cute.
(Well, Chan-gyu... Complicated)

614
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,870
This kid is more mature than I thought.

615
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,830
Yeah, there is a mature side of him.

616
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,920
Who are you going to call?

617
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:26,240
(Seon-yul has a train of thoughts after receiving calls from Jeong-ho and Chan-gyu)

618
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,440
(Feel good)

619
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:33,780
I took a walk with Seon-yul today.

620
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:37,040
I think I'm more into him.

621
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,970
Anyway,

622
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,030
if we made a lot of jokes earlier,

623
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:46,260
we had a real talk during the walk today.

624
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,440
I'll give it a try when the opportunity comes.

625
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,100
I'm finished.

626
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,390
Are you finished?

627
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,390
Are you finished?

628
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,200
Are you back from making the call?

629
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,950
(Nod nod)

630
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,850
(Hyeon, please go to the telephone booth and tell your feelings to the man you like in 30 seconds)

631
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,620
(Hyeon is excited about making a call)

632
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,680
(Glance)

633
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,250
I think Hyeon will also call you today.

634
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,820
-Me?
-Call you.

635
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,460
(Hyeok-jun: I don't know.)

636
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,490
(Hyeok-jun: I don't think so.)

637
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,460
Why? Why do you feel that way?

638
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,910
(Look around)

639
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:48,130
(Scurrying as if afraid of being seen by someone else)

640
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,900
(Feel hesitant after picking up the phone)

641
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:07,810
(Which man does Hyeon have in mind?)

642
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:16,310
(Who is Hyeon gonna call after struggling?)

643
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:25,640
(Will it be Hyeok-jun who he dated earlier?)

644
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:33,690
(Will Hyeon still call Hyeok-jun as he did earlier?)

645
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,740
-Hello.
-Hello.

646
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,410
It was fun today.

647
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:47,770
(Phone is ringing on the third floor)

648
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,770
-Hello.
-Hello.

649
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,600
Um.

650
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,220
It was fun today.

651
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:58,890
(Hyeon stuck to his original feelings and called Hyeok-jun)

652
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,470
Here we are.
(Hyeon stuck to his original feelings and called Hyeok-jun)

653
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,090
(Hyeon stuck to his original feelings and called Hyeok-jun)

654
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:01,380
Thank you for today.
(Hyeon stuck to his original feelings and called Hyeok-jun)

655
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,030
Thank you for today.

656
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,990
Thank you for today.

657
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:05,930
Yeah, thank you for today.

658
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:06,870
(Hyeon: Yeah, thank you for today.)
Yeah, thank you for today.

659
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,720
(Hyeon: Yeah, thank you for today.)

660
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,930
(Kept smiling)

661
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,040
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

662
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,350
(Hyeok-jun is chosen by Eun-chan and Hyeon)

663
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,750
What are you gonna do now?

664
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,730
I don't know what to do.

665
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:29,950
I'm grateful, of course.

666
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,410
After having a date with Hyeon,

667
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:36,470
I think he's a nice guy.

668
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,750
(Step step step-)

669
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,590
I haven't been on such a date for a long time.

670
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,460
It was fun to play like that after a few years.

671
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,830
I think it created some interesting memories.

672
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:02,950
Interesting.

673
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,460
How are you?

674
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,580
Sitting here makes me know who gets the call.

675
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,300
Then why are you sitting here?

676
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
It's interesting.

677
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,270
It's like watching from the perspective of a third person

678
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,270
(Hyeon feels shy after hearing Jeong-hyeon say he saw it all)

679
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,880
(Swoosh (to the room))

680
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,850
(Swoosh to the window as if afraid to be seen by someone else-)

681
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:28,780
What do I do?

682
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:37,920
(Feeling half shy and half happy...)

683
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:54,990
(Jeong-hyeon, please go to the telephone booth and tell your feelings to the man you like in 30 seconds)

684
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:59,750
(Walking quietly so that they won't notice)

685
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:08,450
(Jeong-hyeon doesn't want them to see him)

686
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:17,310
(Who is the man Jeong-hyeon has feelings for?)

687
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:24,890
(Will it be Seon-yul, the first man he called?)

688
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:25,540
I think it's swollen.

689
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,010
(Or Chang-min who has been taking care of Jeong-hyeon?)
I think it's swollen.

690
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:36,510
(Or Chang-min who has been taking care of Jeong-hyeon?)

691
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,860
(Nervous)

692
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,610
-Hello.
-Hello

693
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,130
Well,

694
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,880
I want to thank you for putting bandages around my knee

695
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,040
and for our first date,

696
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,040
(And for our first date)
and for our first date,

697
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,290
so I called you, brother.
(And for our first date)
and for our first date,

698
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,170
so I called you, brother.

699
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:00,960
Thank you.

700
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,390
-Hello.
-Hello.

701
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,180
(Jeong-hyeon is calling Chang-min)

702
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,380
That's how you answer the phone.

703
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:19,010
I want to thank you for putting bandages around my knee

704
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,440
(Chang-min smiles as he feels Jeong-hyeon's sincerity through the phone call)
I want to thank you for putting bandages around my knee

705
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:20,600
(Chang-min smiles as he feels Jeong-hyeon's sincerity through the phone call)

706
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,520
and for our first date,
(Chang-min smiles as he feels Jeong-hyeon's sincerity through the phone call)

707
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,920
-so I called you, brother.
-Thank you.

708
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,970
Got it, brother.

709
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,020
Good night.

710
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,560
-Got it, brother.
-Good night.

711
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,340
(The call ended with a tender "good night")
-Got it, brother.
-Good night.

712
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:34,810
(The call ended with a tender "good night")

713
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:35,380
Okay.
(The call ended with a tender "good night")

714
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,990
(The call ended with a tender "good night")

715
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,770
(Chang-min regains his place in Jeong-hyeon's heart)

716
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:54,990
(Jeong-hyeon goes up to the third floor, not the first floor where Chang-min is)

717
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,360
I got the call when I was with other people.

718
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,940
It made me shy.

719
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,910
(The atmosphere sort of got awkward)

720
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,500
That was fun.

721
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,490
Who did you call?

722
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,730
Me? Can I say it?

723
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,110
Chang-min.

724
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,360
Don't worry. We are not competitors.

725
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,050
Was it Chang-min from the beginning?

726
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,240
It was Seon-yul at the beginning,

727
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,300
but it felt like there was chemistry between Seon-yul and Chan-gyu.

728
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,210
You gave up quickly.

729
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,290
Me? I didn't know who to choose between the two of them on the first day.

730
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,420
(Jeong-hyeon: I didn't know who to choose between Seon-yul and Chang-min on the first day.)
Me? I didn't know who to choose between the two of them on the first day.

731
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:50,940
(Jeong-hyeon: I didn't know who to choose between Seon-yul and Chang-min on the first day.)

732
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:50,970
I don't know what Chang-min is thinking.
(Jeong-hyeon: I didn't know who to choose between Seon-yul and Chang-min on the first day.)

733
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,740
I don't know what Chang-min is thinking.

734
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,390
Chang-min is indeed hard to guess.

735
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:56,810
- Yeah.
- I can't tell from his face.

736
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,740
(Jeong-hyeon: Yeah. Eun-chan: I can't tell from his face.)
- Yeah.
- I can't tell from his face.

737
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,350
(Jeong-hyeon: Yeah. Eun-chan: I can't tell from his face.)

738
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,060
Exactly.
(Jeong-hyeon: Yeah. Eun-chan: I can't tell from his face.)

739
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,950
(Jeong-hyeon: Yeah. Eun-chan: I can't tell from his face.)

740
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,870
But,

741
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,060
as we get close, we don't use honorifics anymore.

742
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:07,890
I've been talking to them.

743
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,820
(Eun-chan: I've been talking to them.)
I've been talking to them.

744
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,240
(Eun-chan: I've been talking to them.)

745
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,430
I thought I wouldn't be nervous when I made the phone call,
(Eun-chan: I've been talking to them.)

746
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,690
I thought I wouldn't be nervous when I made the phone call,

747
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,420
but I still got nervous.

748
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:15,280
-I'm not nervous now.
-I am.

749
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,050
(I'm nervous! Jeong-hyeon: I'm not nervous now.)
-I'm not nervous now.
-I am.

750
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,110
(I'm nervous! Jeong-hyeon: I'm not nervous now.)

751
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,270
I'm gonna show my love.

752
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,630
(One man is gonna show his love)

753
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,660
To whom? Chang-min?
(One man is gonna show his love)

754
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,260
(One man is gonna show his love)

755
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:27,980
It's my turn!

756
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,330
(Seon-yul, please go to the telephone booth and tell your feelings to the man you like in 30 seconds)

757
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:29,870
Oh, no.
(Seon-yul, please go to the telephone booth and tell your feelings to the man you like in 30 seconds)

758
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,610
(Seon-yul, please go to the telephone booth and tell your feelings to the man you like in 30 seconds)

759
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,450
I think I'm the last one today?

760
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,560
I don't know... I'm not sure.

761
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:45,300
(Seon-yul hasn't made up his mind)

762
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,060
(His mind is more elusive than ever after he received calls from two men)

763
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,300
(Who is Seon-yu falling for?)

764
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,460
((Nervous))

765
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:53,820
Who should I call?
((Nervous))

766
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,280
Who should I call?

767
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,500
(Hesitant)

768
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:08,140
(Pressing the button like he has made up his mind)

769
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:15,590
(Who is Seon-yul calling?)

770
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,020
What makes me tired is that you don't know my heart.

771
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,770
(Will it be Chan-gyu who has been showing his feelings for him?)
What makes me tired is that you don't know my heart.

772
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,220
(Will it be Chan-gyu who has been showing his feelings for him?)

773
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,110
I've been showing you my feelings for you.
(Will it be Chan-gyu who has been showing his feelings for him?)

774
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,970
(Will it be Chan-gyu who has been showing his feelings for him?)

775
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:32,760
(Or Chang-min who is unable to sleep?)

776
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,570
-Hello.
-Hello.

777
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,130
Yeah.

778
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:42,720
-Do you know who I am?
-Who is it?

779
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,690
I'm Seon-yul.

780
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,250
-Just so you know.
-Ah, Seon-yul.

781
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,630
(Seon-yul disclosed his name first)
-Just so you know.
-Ah, Seon-yul.

782
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,830
(Seon-yul disclosed his name first)

783
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:54,610
It was nice talking to you today.

784
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:55,790
I also had a good time.

785
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,820
(I also had a good time)
I also had a good time.

786
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,010
(I also had a good time)

787
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,090
Have a good night.

788
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,760
(The phone rings again on the first floor)

789
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:09,310
Oh my Gosh.

790
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:09,910
(Hello. Seon-yul chooses Chang-min)
Oh my Gosh.

791
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:10,490
(Hello. Seon-yul chooses Chang-min)

792
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,200
-Hello.
-Hello.
(Hello. Seon-yul chooses Chang-min)

793
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,250
-Hello.
-Hello.

794
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:11,860
(Hello)
-Hello.
-Hello.

795
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,320
(Hello)

796
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,430
-Yes.
-Do you know who I am?

797
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,120
(Chang-min: Um...)

798
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,460
-I'm Seon-yul.
-Who is it?

799
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,160
Seon-yul.

800
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,570
(Ha ha)

801
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:30,150
It was nice talking to you today.

802
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,970
I also had a good time.

803
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,490
Have a good night.

804
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:35,760
Good night.

805
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:37,840
I really want to tell you that.

806
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:39,730
Thank you.

807
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:40,730
Goodbye.

808
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:41,540
(Goodbye!)

809
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,540
I thought Seon-yul

810
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,520
has a crush on Chan-gyu.

811
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,860
(Chan-gyu and Jeong-ho heard the call by accident)

812
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,650
Oh, my. Turns out someone is popular here.
(Chan-gyu and Jeong-ho heard the call by accident)

813
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,390
Oh, my. Turns out someone is popular here.

814
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:03,510
(Complicated Troubled)

815
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:08,030
(Chang-min feels awkward and leaves his seat)

816
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,180
He's going back.
(Chang-min feels awkward and leaves his seat)

817
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,340
(Chang-min feels awkward and leaves his seat)

818
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,090
I envy him.

819
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,960
(Throwing himself down)

820
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,410
(Chang-min has mixed feelings because he didn't expect Seon-yul to call)

821
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,810
First, I wanted to tell him who I am.

822
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,080
Just let him know.

823
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,120
It's awkward.

824
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,310
I thought I had to tell him.

825
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,570
He was the only one I drop the honorifics with.

826
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:46,000
Today, I dropped the honorifics with him.

827
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:46,690
Don't you have a lot of friends?

828
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:47,440
(Joking Don't you have a lot of friends?)
Don't you have a lot of friends?

829
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,380
(Joking Don't you have a lot of friends?)

830
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:48,540
I don't have any friends.
(Joking Don't you have a lot of friends?)

831
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,170
I don't have any friends.

832
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,100
You're also popular.

833
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,230
I'm popular indeed.

834
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,370
(Ah...)

835
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:56,900
These small details

836
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,850
mean a crush to me...?

837
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,600
It's awkward.

838
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,190
(Running)

839
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,840
(Still feel shy after calling him)

840
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,949
How did it go?

841
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,190
I've said everything I need to say.

842
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,429
You didn't say it fast like a rap, did you?

843
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,550
I wonder who you called,

844
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,370
but I'm not gonna ask.

845
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,469
I see.

846
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,909
(Housemates Hyeok-jun and Seon-yul cheer each other up)

847
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:27,389
(Chang-min, on the other side, still has mixed feelings)

848
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:35,670
(Chang-min, please go to the telephone booth and tell your feelings to the man you like in 30 seconds)

849
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,190
(Huh)

850
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,420
(Hey yo)

851
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:42,870
I think it's no fun.

852
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,179
(Chang-min is walking quietly to the phone booth)
I think it's no fun.

853
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:48,659
(Chang-min is walking quietly to the phone booth)

854
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:56,780
(Jeong-hyeon & Seon-yul Chang-min had mixed feelings after receiving two calls)

855
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:04,330
(Who will Chang-min express his feelings to?)

856
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,540
(Thinking carefully)

857
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:11,940
(Dare not pick up the phone rashly)

858
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:19,110
(Considering for a longer time than before)

859
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:26,960
(Seon-yul who called Chang-min twice in a row?)

860
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:34,380
(Jeong-hyeon who really hits it off with him?)

861
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,870
(Closing eyes tightly)

862
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:53,270
(After long consideration, who will Chang-min call?)

863
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,260
Hello.

864
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,960
Hello, this is Chang-min.

865
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,100
(M-hm...)

866
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,390
I'm that kind of person who doesn't speak sugared words.
(M-hm...)

867
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,380
I'm that kind of person who doesn't speak sugared words.

868
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,270
So many people can't accept it.

869
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,270
I do think we

870
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:20,990
have a connection.

871
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,730
I think it's fun too. Wish you a good night.

872
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:33,270
(A bell ringing on the third floor)

873
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,580
So the character is important.

874
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:38,950
Hello.

875
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,440
(Jeong-hyeon: Hello.)
Hello.

876
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,170
(Jeong-hyeon: Hello.)

877
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:40,850
Hello, this is Chang-min.

878
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,320
(Shy Happy Chang-min's choice was Jeong-hyeon)
Hello, this is Chang-min.

879
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,510
(Shy Happy Chang-min's choice was Jeong-hyeon)

880
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,090
Yeah, brother.

881
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,000
-Is he calling?
-I'm that kind of person

882
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,620
(Is he calling? Gosh!)
-Is he calling?
-I'm that kind of person

883
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:48,810
(Is he calling? Gosh!)

884
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:49,870
who doesn't speak sugared words.
(Is he calling? Gosh!)

885
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:50,460
(Is he calling? Gosh!)

886
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:50,520
So many people can't accept it.
(Is he calling? Gosh!)

887
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:50,720
So many people can't accept it.

888
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,600
(Shielding the noise)
So many people can't accept it.

889
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,060
(Shielding the noise)

890
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:56,760
-Have a connection.
-I'm happy. I think it's really fun.

891
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,790
I think it's fun too. Wish you a good night.

892
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:00,980
(Focusing 1 Focusing 2)
I think it's fun too. Wish you a good night.

893
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,050
(Focusing 1 Focusing 2)

894
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,280
I got it, brother.

895
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,500
I didn't know he would call.

896
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,780
Who was it?

897
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:13,450
-Who could it be?
-I know who it was.

898
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,990
-Was it Chang-min?
-Yeah.

899
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:20,170
-Didn't you say it's fun?
-Successful matchmaking.

900
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:21,910
How observant of you!

901
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:24,120
(Jeong-hyeon: Brother Hyeon, how observant of you!)
How observant of you!

902
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,190
(Jeong-hyeon: Brother Hyeon, how observant of you!)

903
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,090
You're really observant.
(Jeong-hyeon: Brother Hyeon, how observant of you!)

904
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,660
I knew it the moment you picked up the phone.

905
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:36,820
Particularly, I've spent a long time with Jeong-hyeon today.

906
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,300
I think we have a connection.

907
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:46,200
(Chang-min thought the day he had spent with Jeong-hyeon was fun)

908
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,510
That's why your mouth opened so widely.

909
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:54,230
But I feel happy already just being brought together with someone.

910
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,430
Honestly, that was the first call I had received.

911
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,180
The call was the first thing that moved me.

912
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:04,800
It was written all over my face.

913
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,120
(Very happy Jeong-hyeon: Written all over my face.)
It was written all over my face.

914
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,840
(Very happy Jeong-hyeon: Written all over my face.)

915
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,050
My favorite brother called me.

916
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,630
So I'm really happy today.

917
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,830
I've been happy all day long.

918
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,130
(Happy)

919
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:20,720
I'm back.

920
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,470
-Welcome back.
-My phone seems to be broken.

921
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,910
(Jeong-ho: My phone seems to be broken.)
-Welcome back.
-My phone seems to be broken.

922
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,550
(Jeong-ho: My phone seems to be broken.)

923
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,790
Would someone call me just to be sure?

924
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,750
(Someone... Please... Ha-ha)

925
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,780
Someone, please.
(Someone... Please... Ha-ha)

926
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,980
(Chang-min looked relaxed after making the call)

927
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,810
((Who did he call?))

928
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,930
(Seven men have made their calls. Who's the last one?)

929
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,540
Why am I so nervous?

930
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:48,840
That's the normal reaction.

931
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:49,960
Were you nervous before?

932
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,010
Very nervous.

933
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,400
Why is my heart racing?

934
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:58,450
To express your feelings makes you nervous.

935
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,470
When is it my turn?

936
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,580
Is it over?

937
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:04,790
(Got the message after waiting for a long time)

938
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,300
Got it.
(Got the message after waiting for a long time)

939
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:05,950
(Got the message after waiting for a long time)

940
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,800
(Hyeok-jun, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to the person you like in 30 seconds)

941
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,290
(Finds it interesting)

942
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,160
Go ahead.

943
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,430
(Turning around)

944
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:23,050
(Today's last phone call)

945
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:31,270
(The long wait made him more excited and nervous)

946
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:35,190
(Who will Hyeok-jun call?)

947
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:41,670
(Eun-chan who expressed his feelings actively?)

948
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:49,810
(Hyeon who had a date with him today?)

949
00:39:51,890 --> 00:40:01,430
(Hyeok-jun made the choice without hesitation)

950
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:11,860
Hello.

951
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:12,680
Hello.

952
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,620
Who's this?

953
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,420
Have a guess.

954
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,480
Who are you?

955
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:24,510
I felt I didn't talk much with you on the first day.

956
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:24,560
(Is that Hyeok-jun?)
I felt I didn't talk much with you on the first day.

957
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:24,610
(Is that Hyeok-jun?)

958
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,850
-Is that Hyeok-jun?
-Yeah.
(Is that Hyeok-jun?)

959
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,370
(Is that Hyeok-jun?)

960
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,670
So I'm calling you.

961
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:31,880
It's a little mushy.

962
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,010
Anyway...

963
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:41,100
It's not okay if my bangs go upward.

964
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,290
But the first time is very important.

965
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:47,850
(Hyeon saw Hyeok-jun going to make the call)
But the first time is very important.

966
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:48,230
(Hyeon saw Hyeok-jun going to make the call)

967
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:48,820
What to do?
(Hyeon saw Hyeok-jun going to make the call)

968
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,380
(Hyeon saw Hyeok-jun going to make the call)

969
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,180
Let's separate.
(Hyeon saw Hyeok-jun going to make the call)

970
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,340
(Hyeon saw Hyeok-jun going to make the call)

971
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,040
Really.
(Hyeon saw Hyeok-jun going to make the call)

972
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,070
(Holding the phone Looking forward to the call...)

973
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,180
Your bangs go upward?
(Holding the phone Looking forward to the call...)

974
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:56,420
(Holding the phone Looking forward to the call...)

975
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,430
If they go up over my eyebrow...
(Holding the phone Looking forward to the call...)

976
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,150
(Holding the phone Looking forward to the call...)

977
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:02,100
No, I really have mixed feelings.

978
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,900
Gosh!

979
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,710
(Ah!)

980
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:07,550
((Who is it?))

981
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,210
My phone is off.
((Who is it?))

982
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:08,970
((Who is it?))

983
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,200
Hello.

984
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,180
It's really interesting.

985
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,770
They all seemed to have called him.

986
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,570
Except you and me, everyone has called Chang-min.

987
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,220
Brother Chang-min is popular.

988
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,300
(Wow)

989
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,070
Who's this?

990
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:30,000
I felt I didn't talk much with you on the first day.

991
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,420
-Is it Hyeok-jun?
-Yeah.

992
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:33,070
So I'm calling you.

993
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,230
(Lying down Hyeok-jun: So I'm calling you)
So I'm calling you.

994
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,710
(Lying down Hyeok-jun: So I'm calling you)

995
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:36,670
(Crying)

996
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,340
It's a little syrupy.
(Crying)

997
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,540
(Crying)

998
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,010
Anyway, it was nice to meet you.

999
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,570
Thank you for calling me.

1000
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,480
Have a good rest today. See you later.

1001
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,370
Has he hung up?

1002
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,780
(Another call that moved Chang-min)

1003
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,700
(Uh huh...)

1004
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,340
Today I've received three calls.

1005
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,730
The first one was from Jeong-hyeon.

1006
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:09,520
After that Seon-yul called.

1007
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,630
My feelings became mixed since then.

1008
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,150
When I was thinking about what to do,

1009
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,530
Hyeok-jun gave me the call.

1010
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:22,100
I feel receiving a call isn't always a good thing.

1011
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,750
Today, my feelings have been mixed all day long.

1012
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,620
(Ah boo hoo)

1013
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:32,530
(Chang-min can't get up now)

1014
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,350
The decision of calling Chang-min

1015
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:40,110
was made after long consideration last night.

1016
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:43,240
He listened to me patiently.

1017
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:49,700
And I think I shouldn't dither over Eun-chan.

1018
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,970
Now I like Chang-min best.

1019
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,820
So I called Chang-min.

1020
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,060
What to do?

1021
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,560
I feel thirsty suddenly.

1022
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:05,850
Oh, forget it.

1023
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:06,990
Well done.

1024
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:12,220
(The two roommates called the same man)

1025
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:13,630
Are you feeling good?

1026
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:15,100
-What?
-Feeling good? Don't you think it's not bad?

1027
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,540
(Seon-yul: Don't you think it's not bad?)
-What?
-Feeling good? Don't you think it's not bad?

1028
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,980
-I'm feeling OK.
-Don't you feel more comfortable?

1029
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:18,910
(Seon-yul: Don't you feel more comfortable?)
-I'm feeling OK.
-Don't you feel more comfortable?

1030
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:19,360
(Seon-yul: Don't you feel more comfortable?)

1031
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:19,510
It's hard.
(Seon-yul: Don't you feel more comfortable?)

1032
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:20,470
It's hard.

1033
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,590
Brother, who did you call?

1034
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:26,610
Who was it?

1035
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,290
It's a secret.

1036
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,730
Secret? Really?

1037
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,300
But I'm not sure.

1038
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,950
We can't reject it, can we?

1039
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:37,970
No, we can't.

1040
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:40,680
I don't even know who has called.

1041
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:41,830
(Jeong-ho: Ah...no caller ID)

1042
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:43,170
No caller ID?
(Jeong-ho: Ah...no caller ID)

1043
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:44,250
(Jeong-ho: Ah...no caller ID)

1044
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:44,310
Yeah, it only displays the public telephone number.
(Jeong-ho: Ah...no caller ID)

1045
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:44,380
Yeah, it only displays the public telephone number.

1046
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,270
(Chang-min: It only displays the public telephone number.)
Yeah, it only displays the public telephone number.

1047
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,230
(Chang-min: It only displays the public telephone number.)

1048
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:52,430
((He didn't miss my phone on purpose...) Jeong-ho resolved the misunderstanding)

1049
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:53,420
It's really...

1050
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,540
(Chang-min: Ah, it's really...)
It's really...

1051
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,390
(Chang-min: Ah, it's really...)

1052
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:59,300
We had a good time together during the day. At night it becomes like this.

1053
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,230
-It's driving me crazy.
-That's why it's fun.

1054
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,850
(Ah)

1055
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:06,650
Ah, I really...
(Ah)

1056
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:07,650
(Ah)

1057
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:13,220
(Today's phone call time was over)

1058
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,540
In that case,

1059
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:20,070
who did Chang-min call?

1060
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:22,540
Hyeon.

1061
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:24,080
-Really?
-I have the feeling.

1062
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:24,740
I'm not sure about it.

1063
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,970
(Seon-yul: Well, I'm not sure about it.)
I'm not sure about it.

1064
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,160
No, I think I've guessed right.

1065
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,300
(Today's phone call time was over)

1066

1068
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,410
Oh, my God.

1069
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,280
The phone call time was over.

1070
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:42,170
(Ha-ha Jeong-ho: It turns out the phone is fine.)

1071

It turns out the phone is fine.
(Ha-ha Jeong-ho: It turns out the phone is fine.)

1072
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,590
(Ha-ha Jeong-ho: It turns out the phone is fine.)

1073
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:46,880
It isn't broken.

1074
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,680
Today's phone call time is over. No, boo hoo.

1075
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,070
It says the phone call time is over.

1076
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:56,350
I'm a little uncomfortable now.

1077
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:57,650
Are you tired?

1078
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:59,460
No, I'm not.

1079
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:01,220
Sorry.

1080
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,210
(Walk out quickly)

1081
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:11,140
((That's not what I mean... boo hoo))

1082
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:16,880
(Including the new man, all eight men have made the calls)

1083
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:21,930
(What kind of a storm would today's phone calls set off...?)

1084
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:24,400
(His Man)

1085
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:24,630
(Men's House got a message)

1086
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:25,300
What is it?
(Men's House got a message)

1087
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:25,830
(Men's House got a message)

(Hyeon: Here comes another task card.)

1089
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:27,350
Here comes another task card.
(Hyeon: Here comes another task card.)

1090
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:27,960
(Hyeon: Here comes another task card.)

1091
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:28,270

1093
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,200
(The message of exchanging rooms & roommates gave the men a big surprise)

1094
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,900
(In the face of unexpected situations, the men have various ideas)

1095
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,320
It's the time for exchanging.

1096
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,560
It's over. We have to exchange rooms.

1097
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,220
I don't want to change the room.

1098
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,440
(The men bet their room allocation rights on the racing game)

1099
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,460
I must get that and overturn the situation.

1100
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:46,790
I'll be the first.

1101

(The men who bet their room allocation rights start a fierce competition)

1102

(To win the victory fight against each other without making any concessions)

1103
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,450
(Jeong-hyeon: What's wrong? Brother Eun-chan, what's wrong with you!?)

1104
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,630
I won't lose! How could I lose?

1105
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,060
I must win first place.

1106
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:59,530
(The men were more ambitious than at any time)

1107

(After the rooms were reallocated)

1109
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:02,890
Thanks for your hard work.
(After the rooms were reallocated)

1110
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:04,310
I really want it.

1111
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:06,970
Men's mind is really unpredictable.

1112
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:10,720
(There's a strange air stream in the Men's House)

1113

(The men have subtle feelings for each other)

1114
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,180
What is happening now?

1115
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:16,660
(What big changes will the new room allocation bring about?)

1116
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,590
Now the competition between them is very fierce.
(What big changes will the new room allocation bring about?)

1117

(What big changes will the new room allocation bring about?)

1118

Something should have happened between 1 and 4.
(What big changes will the new room allocation bring about?)
