1
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,999
=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,900
(A Short Separation)

3
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,540
(Ten Years Ago)

4
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,950
We're finally back.

5
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,430
This trip was possible

6
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,640
because of you.

7
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,040
But then again,

8
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,280
Chief Liu knew

9
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,640
you just got married

10
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,840
and still insisted on assigning you
on this mission

11
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,030
to buy peonies.

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,280
I feel sorry for you.

13
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,310
Our trip wasn't in vain.

14
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,120
We received some subsidies.

15
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,470
Yes.

16
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:24,450
Fortunately, the journey was smooth.

17
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,400
No accidents happened.

18
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,800
Mr. Li!

19
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,240
Mr. Li.

20
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,430
Go.

21
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,520
Mr. Li.

22
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,590
Old donkey!

23
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,840
Make way.

24
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,030
Jinniang.

25
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,590
Shande.

26
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,000
Why did you just come back?

27
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,870
The subordinates who went with you

28
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,910
came back at noon.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,870
Didn't he tell you?

30
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,030
It delayed me.

31
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,030
It?

32
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,750
It went into the woods

33
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,280
and brought me in too.

34
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,080
The two of us

35
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,280
were delayed by another donkey.

36
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,977
That's normal for donkeys.

37
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,000
Enough about donkeys for now.

38
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,800
You came back a day later

39
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,840
than planned.

40
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,030
Did something unpleasant

41
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,870
happen?

42
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,960
No.

43
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,840
I met tax collectors on the way.

44
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,800
If I don't miss you,

45
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,000
I'll be back later.

46
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,470
Everyone.

47
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,400
Today's room is half price

48
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,030
with free breakfast provided.

49
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:51,020
(Futao Inn's Rooms Are Half Price Today)

50
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,150
Half price.

51
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,088
A change of environment?

52
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,680
Let's go.

53
00:04:07,177 --> 00:04:07,960
It's too expensive.

54
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,710
No, I made money.

55
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,270
Let's go home.

56
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,310
Breakfast is free.

57
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,866
It's still a waste of money.

58
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,510
Something's poking me.

59
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,111
Look at those big eyes.

60
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,066
Who does she take after?

61
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,920
Not you, of course.

62
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,520
Smile.

63
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,460
=Episode 18=

64
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,360
Li Shande, what are you doing?

65
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,870
I'm saving you.

66
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,710
What am I doing?

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,310
What are you doing?

68
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,870
You. How dare you interrupt my ritual?

69
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,390
This thing is poisonous.

70
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,750
These are the flowers and leaves

71
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,700
(Chai)
of thorn apple.

72
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,560
If you burn this thing after drying it,

73
00:05:12,622 --> 00:05:14,390
you'll have hallucinations
when you smell it.

74
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,133
This is poisonous.

75
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,480
Do you believe me

76
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,190
or this city folk?

77
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,120
I've seen this thing many times.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,720
When we're sick,

79
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,430
we'll recover after smelling it.

80
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,950
You didn't recover.

81
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,000
It has an anesthetic effect.

82
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,190
It just temporarily

83
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,950
covers up your illness.

84
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,790
Stop smelling it.

85
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,310
How does a city folk like you

86
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,390
know so much?

87
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:38,022
This is what I do for a living.

88
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,230
I'm not leaving!

89
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,200
I'm not leaving!

90
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,750
The gods have shown me a sign.

91
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,030
The gods said

92
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,270
this city folk

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,600
brought changes

94
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,720
to us Dong people.

95
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,480
But I have to stay and observe

96
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,750
whether it's good or bad.

97
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,870
You're from Chang'an.

98
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,950
Do you have a house there?

99
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,270
A residence.

100
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,750
A residence isn't cheap.

101
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:17,670
It's bought on a loan?

102
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,190
That means you have no savings.

103
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,680
How much is your salary?

104
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,190
How much did you borrow?

105
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,720
When do you plan to pay it back?

106
00:06:26,288 --> 00:06:27,560
Do you have any plans in mind?

107
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,800
Daughters are good and considerate.

108
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,000
You don't have much to offer.

109
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,750
But at least you're honest

110
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,800
with me.

111
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,000
Your character is decent,

112
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,750
so

113
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,720
I won't bother with the rest.

114
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,270
Well.

115
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,000
If you manage to transport the litchis,

116
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,040
do you plan to return to Chang'an

117
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,830
or live in Gaozhou?

118
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,360
I'm going back to Chang'an.

119
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,350
No.

120
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,310
Tong

121
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,750
can't go back to Chang'an with you.

122
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,360
Tong doesn't need to go back

123
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
to Chang'an with me.

124
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:05,133
You...

125
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,000
If I settle

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
the litchis

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,390
and His Majesty eats fresh litchi,

128
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,870
this litchi garden will become
an imperial litchi garden.

129
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,310
No one will cause trouble.

130
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,070
Tong can then

131
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,133
stay in this litchi garden

132
00:07:15,155 --> 00:07:16,370
and not follow me to Chang'an.

133
00:07:16,377 --> 00:07:17,160
But you two

134
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,750
will never see each other again.

135
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,240
You'll be separated.

136
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,120
This will be...

137
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,870
Great Shaman.

138
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,800
You misunderstood.

139
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,350
All I care about

140
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,222
is my daughter.

141
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,920
I've never had any improper thoughts

142
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,600
about Miss Tong.

143
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,480
We're friends.

144
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,360
I've made it clear

145
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,070
to her.

146
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,030
Miss Tong...

147
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,190
Beautiful.

148
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,800
She's beautiful and intelligent.

149
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,600
Right?

150
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,040
Yes.

151
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,830
She's kind and will find a good match.

152
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,360
Aunt.

153
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,120
Don't try to matchmake us.

154
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,480
We're really friends.

155
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,800
You think

156
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,533
I'm meddling in your business,
don't you?

157
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:49,870
I have to ask clearly.

158
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,000
What if you're deceived?

159
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,870
Fine, if you don't let me ask,

160
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,240
I'll go back to Mount Dayu now.

161
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,270
I'm leaving.

162
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,600
No.

163
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,680
If you let this city folk

164
00:07:58,755 --> 00:08:00,560
stay in this litchi garden
for another day,

165
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,870
I'm never coming back.

166
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,430
Great Shaman, you...

167
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,310
You said you're from Mount Dayu.

168
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,950
Is Mount Dayu

169
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,190
to the north of Lingnan?

170
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,720
And going further north
is Jiangnan West Road?

171
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,110
What's wrong?

172
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,390
You despise our poor
and remote area, huh?

173
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,230
No.

174
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,240
I...

175
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,480
I spoke a little abruptly.

176
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,670
Great Shaman.

177
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,622
I want to ask you something.

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,030
Will it be more beautiful

179
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,270
if you stand higher?

180
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,510
Mount Pingyun is the most pleasant

181
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,333
at this time of year.

182
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,390
As the old saying goes, our fates

183
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,910
are like water drops,

184
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,480
drifting with the wind
and having their own fates.

185
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,120
Some flowed into the spring

186
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,270
and went into
the porcelain cups of the nobles,

187
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,440
while some flowed
into the grass nest under the rock

188
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,955
and became sewage.

189
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,510
You're like this clear spring

190
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,990
while I'm

191
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,120
like this sewage.

192
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,560
Miss.

193
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,390
We can't say that.

194
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,550
We can't choose our birth,

195
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,444
but we can change our situation

196
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,670
through hard work.

197
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,510
You cried?

198
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,630
You misunderstood.

199
00:09:57,288 --> 00:09:59,510
It's just that the fog in this mountain
is so thick

200
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,960
that it clouded my eyes.

201
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,360
I'm glad

202
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,030
that you were willing to come out

203
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,750
and spend the day with me today.

204
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,200
You speak with grace

205
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:11,510
and are willing to comfort me like this.

206
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,750
I couldn't be more delighted.

207
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,480
If you don't mind,

208
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,960
I'm willing to follow you.

209
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,360
Even if it means going to Chang'an.

210
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,270
I don't ask for any status

211
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,311
but only your care and affection.

212
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,440
Miss.

213
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,870
Do you believe

214
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,510
what you said?

215
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,066
You have strong beliefs.

216
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,000
If you

217
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,030
can't charm me today,

218
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,240
are you going

219
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,844
to be in trouble when you go back?

220
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,550
I don't know

221
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,750
what you're talking about.

222
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,866
You know.

223
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,840
You know what I'm talking about.

224
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,440
You should never

225
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,840
get straight to the point.

226
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,870
We don't know each other very well.

227
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,844
It's inappropriate
to get straight to the point.

228
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:14,120
We can take it slow.

229
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,960
No.

230
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,040
Think about it.

231
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,480
The target hasn't been set up,

232
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,000
so there's no use firing arrows.

233
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,440
The eyes can't deceive people.

234
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,440
Look at me carefully.

235
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,870
Miss, you're about to vomit.

236
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,790
I know myself very well.

237
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,480
We've met several times before.

238
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,000
You have never looked me in the eye.

239
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,150
Just yesterday,

240
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,840
you suddenly looked at me affectionately

241
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,790
and flirtatiously.

242
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,630
It must have been for show.

243
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,550
I agreed to come out with you today

244
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,750
because I wanted you to relax

245
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,750
and unwind.

246
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,320
No need to act.

247
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,720
Acting is tiring, Miss.

248
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,790
Turns out you already knew.

249
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,630
I just don't understand

250
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:09,870
why Chief Scribe Zhao

251
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,080
cares so much

252
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,000
about my love life.

253
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,320
He...

254
00:12:16,555 --> 00:12:18,133
It's alright if you don't tell me.

255
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,550
If Chief Scribe Zhao asks,

256
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,630
just tell him

257
00:12:22,355 --> 00:12:23,977
you want to vomit at the sight of me

258
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,240
and can't go on.

259
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,360
Don't force love.

260
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,590
Alright?

261
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,390
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

262
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,750
Litchis' transportation

263
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,440
has to pass through Mount Dayu,

264
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,790
go north and enter Jiangnan West Road.

265
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,670
But Mount Dayu

266
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,670
is too steep.

267
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,111
It takes two days to go through
the winding mountain path.

268
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,790
So is there

269
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,390
a new route

270
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,800
or shortcut

271
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,360
that can save me two days?

272
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,630
I'll succeed, right?

273
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,240
I just want to ask

274
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,030
if you know

275
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,870
of such a way.

276
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:07,990
Shande.

277
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:09,870
Alright.

278
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,840
You can play with it.

279
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,150
Isn't that nonsense?

280
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,030
Can you pass through

281
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,150
Mount Dayu randomly?

282
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,030
Aunt.

283
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,440
Help him out this time.

284
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,480
I can't help him with this.

285
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,360
The gods can help him,

286
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,120
but he doesn't believe in them.

287
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,030
Great Shaman.

288
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,200
I believe we're the same.

289
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,270
Don't speak

290
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,790
as if you know me.

291
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,630
Look.

292
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,360
Tong is indeed my friend.

293
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,000
Yes.

294
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,910
I know very well that it's not easy

295
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,622
for Dong people
to live in the mountains.

296
00:13:44,622 --> 00:13:45,911
They lack clothing and medicine.

297
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
If they got hurt,

298
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,200
they could only wait for death.

299
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,270
In the name of Great Shaman,

300
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,230
you use the hand of the gods
to provide them

301
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,200
with the utmost healing and salvation.

302
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,870
I understand your pain,

303
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,870
so I don't despise you.

304
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,222
I only admire you.

305
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,080
Really.

306
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,720
Out of all city people,

307
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,666
you're not the most eloquent one.

308
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
But

309
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
it's rare that you can understand
us Dong people

310
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,840
so well.

311
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,510
I'm sincerely asking for your advice.

312
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,600
Aunt, help him.

313
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,870
There's a man in our tribe

314
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,720
named Tu.

315
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,750
He's the only person in our tribe

316
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,720
who lives in Gaozhou.

317
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,350
One day,

318
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,080
Tu came back to the mountains.

319
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,080
With the city people's

320
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,840
pen and paper,

321
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,320
he just

322
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,320
doodled away.

323
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,200
I was curious, so I asked

324
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,933
what he was doing.

325
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,720
He told me

326
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,720
he discovered a secret path

327
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,150
on Mount Dayu

328
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,200
when he was a hunter.

329
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,240
If he could transport

330
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,270
the things he drew

331
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,270
out of Lingnan along that path,

332
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,870
he could make a lot of money.

333
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,630
Our tribe will no longer

334
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,080
have to worry about food and water.

335
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,600
So

336
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,270
such a path really exists?

337
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,230
Yes.

338
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,030
But he suddenly disappeared.

339
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,510
It's been ten years.

340
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,000
There's no news of him.

341
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,320
He's nowhere to be found.

342
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,390
Does no one know this way

343
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,230
except him?

344
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,750
Only he knows.

345
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,720
We Dong people

346
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,480
don't deal with city people,

347
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,320
so we don't have any news. He...

348
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,750
Li Shande, where are you going?

349
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,000
Mr. Su.

350
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,720
There's good news.

351
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,680
What good news?

352
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,720
Calm down.

353
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,955
Tell me slowly. What good news?

354
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:57,990
Well...

355
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,440
There's a Dong shaman

356
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,440
in the litchi garden.

357
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,710
Shaman?

358
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,240
Great Shaman.

359
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,270
She said there's a shortcut

360
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,910
on Mount Dayu.

361
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,510
Shortcut?

362
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,466
A shortcut
to avoid the winding mountain path.

363
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,320
It'll save two days of travel time.

364
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,630
This is really good news.

365
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,960
But there's a problem.

366
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,080
What's the problem?

367
00:16:21,155 --> 00:16:22,888
We don't know where this path is.

368
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,200
This is not good news.

369
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,270
But someone knows.

370
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:27,960
Who?

371
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,666
A Dong man named Tu.

372
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,510
Tu?

373
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,630
Where is he?

374
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:33,177
He has disappeared for ten years.

375
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,720
And?

376
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,680
No more.

377
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,777
What good news is this?

378
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,030
I'm here to ask

379
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,377
if you can use your connections

380
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,022
to help me find Tu.

381
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:44,120
If this plan succeeds,

382
00:16:44,155 --> 00:16:45,444
won't this be good news?

383
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,600
You said

384
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,888
Amita's maid is pursuing you?

385
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,840
Yes.

386
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,470
Interesting.

387
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,480
Tell me.

388
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,040
Back in Chang'an,

389
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,510
I could handle every drinking party.

390
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Now in Lingnan,

391
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,830
I've stirred up the love game here.

392
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,870
It's...

393
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,680
It's annoying

394
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,920
to be surrounded

395
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,200
by these beautiful women.

396
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,550
I think you're excited.

397
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,444
You didn't get such a good job

398
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:33,400
in Chang'an.

399
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,240
You misunderstood me.

400
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,550
I just think

401
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,177
I'm talented in dealing

402
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:42,288
with emotional matters.

403
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,560
Feelings may arise,

404
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,844
but a gentleman stays unmoved
when facing desire.

405
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,030
But...

406
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,030
Lan Yu

407
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,880
is really pretty.

408
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,310
If you've caught feelings,

409
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,333
you can turn pretense into reality.

410
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,310
Your trip to Lingnan won't be in vain.

411
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,200
You misunderstood me again.

412
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,720
Although Lan Yu

413
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,480
is pretty,

414
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,160
the person I like

415
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,440
is both talented and beautiful.

416
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,040
Alright.

417
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,355
Let's get down to business.

418
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,590
From the clues we've found so far,

419
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:23,355
the fire at Qijing Pavilion that year

420
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,480
should be

421
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,720
a premeditated murder.

422
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,920
We found out

423
00:18:27,955 --> 00:18:29,533
that before Qijing Pavilion caught fire,

424
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,480
Lan's father happened to have bought

425
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,880
2,000 shares of Sea Sail Fund.

426
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,110
Are you saying

427
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,400
the one who sold the 2,000 shares

428
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,266
was the arsonist?

429
00:18:39,311 --> 00:18:40,080
That's right.

430
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,550
A large part

431
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,590
of Sea Sail Fund's value

432
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,880
is built on Haihu's reputation.

433
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,110
Once Haihu died,

434
00:18:45,155 --> 00:18:46,550
Sea Sail Fund completely collapsed.

435
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:48,240
All those who bought at high prices

436
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,400
lost money.

437
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,110
Lan's father

438
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,510
also lost everything.

439
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,640
There was a big mess.

440
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,880
Is there any evidence to prove

441
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,955
that it was He Youguang
who set the fire?

442
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,480
No.

443
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,830
But the 2,000 shares of Sea Sail Fund

444
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,333
were bought from a broker named Tu.

445
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,550
If we find him, we may find

446
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,844
that year's truth.

447
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,150
Burned to death?

448
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,390
We're doomed.

449
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,550
Does that mean

450
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,350
we can't find the Mount Dayu path

451
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,680
Tu knows?

452
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
You said Tu

453
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,533
was burned to death ten years ago?

454
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,355
It's only hearsay.

455
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,270
Impossible.

456
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,110
Five years ago,

457
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,640
he asked a merchant

458
00:19:31,688 --> 00:19:32,720
to bring something back

459
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,920
to our tribe.

460
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,830
Did you see Tu?

461
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,550
I didn't see him,

462
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,920
but he asked the merchant

463
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,270
to send some medicines

464
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,688
back to his parents.

465
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,270
Did he leave any messages?

466
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,480
No.

467
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,830
Who is this merchant?

468
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,110
I don't know.

469
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,000
He delivered the things and left.

470
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,030
We just met once.

471
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,070
There's not much difference

472
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,880
between disappearance and death.

473
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,480
We must shorten the schedule.

474
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,510
Great Shaman, think about it again.

475
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,920
Are there any other clues?

476
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,240
Clues?

477
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,590
Clues?

478
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,590
I remember it now.

479
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,310
The merchant

480
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,350
kept staring at me.

481
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,510
It's annoying.

482
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,000
I scolded him,

483
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,480
but he explained to me

484
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,733
that he had lazy eyes.

485
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,280
Lan.

486
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm broke.

487
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,160
Lend me some money.

488
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,222
You need collateral to lend money.

489
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,280
What

490
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,110
do you have?

491
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,240
I...

492
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,640
(Lazy Eye Feng)
Your father and I

493
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,830
are from the same hometown.

494
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,240
If you care about our past...

495
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,550
How dare you bring up the past?

496
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
You ruined our family.

497
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,830
I was lucky enough to survive until now.

498
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,480
I...

499
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,640
I don't want to talk about the past.

500
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,590
But you insisted

501
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,750
on forcing a bond with me.

502
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,640
You can't blame me

503
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,110
for what happened back then.

504
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,720
We agreed to bear our own risks

505
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,030
when buying Sea Sail Fund.

506
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,680
I only helped

507
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,440
to make the connection.

508
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,480
You can't keep

509
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,440
dwelling on Sea Sail Fund.

510
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,480
Your father wasn't the only one

511
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,240
who lost everything.

512
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,720
The whole city lost everything, Lan.

513
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,177
You refuse to admit
that you're responsible then.

514
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,190
Lan.

515
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,830
You know how I've been doing

516
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,200
these years.

517
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,480
I can barely make ends meet.

518
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,440
Once I have a bit of money,

519
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,777
I send it to your cockfighting arena.

520
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,830
I'm really desperate this time.

521
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,790
I... I'm sick.

522
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,133
Then why are you still gambling?

523
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,640
What else can I do?

524
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,977
I don't have enough money.

525
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,310
I'm begging you.

526
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,160
I'm to blame

527
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,720
for what happened to your family
ten years ago.

528
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,590
But I don't deserve to die.

529
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:07,870
Lan,

530
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,640
I'm old enough to be your uncle.

531
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,830
Just help me this once,

532
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,750
Lan.

533
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,510
Why should I help you?

534
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,350
Because you left me

535
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,911
down and out?

536
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,310
Good. Keep going.

537
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:51,380
(Inspector's Office)

538
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,800
Very well.

539
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,320
Almost done. Come.

540
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,860
(Inspector's Office)

541
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,560
Chief Scribe Zhao.

542
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,560
How did it go?

543
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,510
Ma Guiyun saw through it.

544
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,830
You mean he figured out

545
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,000
our plan?

546
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,760
Yes.

547
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,270
Whether he did or not,

548
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,355
did he fall for you?

549
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,040
No.

550
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:37,720
He wasn't moved at all when he saw you?

551
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:47,111
It seems
those around Right Chancellor

552
00:23:47,111 --> 00:23:47,990
are really something.

553
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,350
He must've undergone

554
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,400
special training.

555
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,240
Will he

556
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,350
tell Ms. Amita about this?

557
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:53,880
He won't.

558
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,177
If Ms. Amita finds out
that I act behind her back...

559
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,030
If he truly

560
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,400
admires Amita,

561
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,880
he wouldn't mention a word.

562
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,910
I need time to think.

563
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,280
You may go.

564
00:24:04,466 --> 00:24:06,333
I'll leave the rest to you,
Chief Scribe Zhao.

565
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,680
I take my leave.

566
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,590
Come, have some tea.

567
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,110
Dear,

568
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,711
you seem troubled.

569
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,910
Lately,

570
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,110
I had Amita's maid, Lan Yu,

571
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,550
try to seduce Ma Guiyun.

572
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,790
Miss Lan Yu

573
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,310
is quite a beauty,

574
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,790
yet Ma Guiyun isn't attracted by her.

575
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,550
That puzzles me.

576
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,110
Why do I feel like

577
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,155
the one falling for the beauty

578
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,440
is you?

579
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,390
Dear,

580
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,790
are you smitten with the young woman

581
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,480
and thinking

582
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,070
about her right now?

583
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,320
Of course not.

584
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,830
People never cherish
what comes too easily.

585
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,510
I was too easy

586
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,110
for you.

587
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,720
What are you saying?

588
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,488
You don't understand.

589
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,920
This is a love trap

590
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,400
for Ma Guiyun.

591
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,720
If he steps into it,

592
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,030
I'll have a way

593
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,244
into Chang'an.

594
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,320
So

595
00:25:41,555 --> 00:25:43,030
you haven't given up on Chang'an.

596
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:50,720
I met you when I had nothing.

597
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,920
A handful of rice in times of need

598
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,844
is more precious
than a hundred taels of gold.

599
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,110
I will never betray you.

600
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,880
But now,

601
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,577
everything appears unexpectable.

602
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,030
All the Hu merchants
have started supporting

603
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,160
the litchi delivery.

604
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,590
If it succeeds,

605
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,480
I don't know

606
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,880
what the future will be like.

607
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,190
That old-timer

608
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,311
is not someone I can follow.

609
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,720
I have to figure out my own path.

610
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,030
Perhaps Ma Guiyun

611
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,960
is our chance.

612
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,350
But Dear,

613
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,310
you're not close to him.

614
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,030
Dear,

615
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,222
your words strike true.

616
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,320
I shall

617
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,960
get close to him.

618
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,820
(Lingnan, Fang's Coconut Juice)

619
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,400
I asked you out today

620
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,844
to apologize in person.

621
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,400
I'm sorry about Lan Yu's actions.

622
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,590
Pay no mind to it, Chief Scribe Zhao.

623
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,920
Fate is a strange thing.

624
00:27:00,622 --> 00:27:02,222
Perhaps the time hasn't come yet.

625
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,880
Let's leave it at that.

626
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,830
Guiyun, you're so understanding.

627
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,880
Lately, spring farming has just ended,

628
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,666
and the summer harvest hasn't begun.

629
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,240
Besides, I'm not in charge
of fish farming either.

630
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,110
I suddenly find myself free

631
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,510
and have the chance

632
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,830
to drink with you.

633
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,160
You're living the kind of life

634
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,750
I envy most.

635
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,310
Unlike in Chang'an,

636
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,960
it's busy with activities
every solar term,

637
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,790
one after another,

638
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
twenty-four hours,

639
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,080
without pause.

640
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,480
Prosperous Chang'an

641
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,480
is where all talented minds

642
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,880
long to be.

643
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,350
Back then,

644
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,310
I once received the favor of someone

645
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,533
and was given an opportunity
to go to Chang'an.

646
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,590
But

647
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,550
I was already engaged to my wife,

648
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,750
so I gave it up.

649
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,680
Sometimes,

650
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,110
when I lie awake at night,
I still wonder

651
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,070
what might've happened

652
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,955
if I had gone there.

653
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,733
Xinmin, you're a man of great talent.

654
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,880
It's only natural
someone took notice of you.

655
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,590
But you're also well-versed

656
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,880
in both farming and commerce.

657
00:28:28,088 --> 00:28:29,688
That, I don't quite understand.

658
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,040
I was

659
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:34,440
the top scorer
in the triennial provincial exam

660
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,510
and entered the office

661
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,310
through someone's recommendation.

662
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,440
When I first arrived in Lingnan,

663
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,000
I met resistance at every turn.

664
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,350
I once farmed

665
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,030
and also handled the Sea Sail Fund.

666
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,390
I did everything.

667
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,750
After many twists and turns,

668
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,422
I finally entered
the Inspector's Office.

669
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,270
I heard the Sea Sail Fund

670
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,160
was once all the rage in Lingnan.

671
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,750
Yet, in one night,

672
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,510
it stripped everyone of their last dime.

673
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,270
It was a huge mystery.

674
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,520
Yes,

675
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,070
a huge mystery, indeed.

676
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:14,590
That reminds me
of being a broken back then.

677
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:17,920
That was when Haihu

678
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,555
planned to sell the Sea Sail Fund.

679
00:29:19,644 --> 00:29:20,711
He was a pirate

680
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,270
and used to robbery.

681
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,310
But this was different.

682
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,750
So he needed someone
to issue the bonds for him.

683
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,550
I was an able broker.

684
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,240
I had connections everywhere

685
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,240
and was well-rounded.

686
00:29:31,244 --> 00:29:32,622
There was no deal I couldn't close

687
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,888
and no contact I couldn't reach.

688
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,000
If Haihu wanted to issue
the Sea Sail Fund,

689
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
he had to go through me.

690
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,550
That's how

691
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,640
I started handling the business.

692
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,400
Truly someone with wide connections

693
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,440
and great people skills.

694
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,310
Haihu really found

695
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,550
the right man.

696
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,550
I wasn't the only one.

697
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,550
He hired many people.

698
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,510
But I was the best

699
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,070
and handled the most trades.

700
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,070
I heard

701
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,750
about that.

702
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,830
But I also gathered the broker
with the largest share of bonds

703
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,200
was a Dong person.

704
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,160
They told you about Tu, right?

705
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,880
How could a crude Tong man

706
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,160
compare to me?

707
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,960
He only surpassed me

708
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,109
because of the last deal.

709
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,200
An unknown seller

710
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,733
suddenly sold 2,000 shares.

711
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,000
Tu

712
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,270
landed that deal

713
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,350
by sheer fluke.

714
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,190
But so what?

715
00:30:19,244 --> 00:30:20,000
He died in the fire

716
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,577
at Qijing Pavilion in the end.

717
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,790
Life is unpredictable.

718
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,310
Tu and Haihu

719
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,590
both died in that fire,

720
00:30:34,977 --> 00:30:36,480
and the Sea Sail Fund turned into

721
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,866
worthless scraps.

722
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:38,800
If not for that,

723
00:30:38,844 --> 00:30:40,266
I'd be a wealthy man by now.

724
00:30:42,266 --> 00:30:44,155
Of course, I wouldn't have
had this chance

725
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,688
to meet you.

726
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:46,888
It must be a shame.

727
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,720
Come.

728
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,480
You're a man of great talent.

729
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,480
You won't be kept down for long.

730
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,480
No worries. Once I return to Chang'an,

731
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,933
I'll be sure to recommend you.

732
00:30:57,955 --> 00:30:58,830
Your talent

733
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,977
won't be buried in Lingnan.

734
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:01,960
Don't try to tempt me.

735
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,440
I'm serving Inspector He now,

736
00:31:04,688 --> 00:31:05,720
and I'm content.

737
00:31:05,755 --> 00:31:06,977
I have no other ambitions.

738
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:11,110
If you're willing to recommend me,

739
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,177
I'll surely repay you handsomely.

740
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:26,000
You've been running about

741
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,110
a lot lately.

742
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,440
You're exhausted

743
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,790
and have lost weight.

744
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,200
What's the use of all this toil?

745
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,680
A man who died many years ago

746
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,030
can't come back to life.

747
00:31:41,355 --> 00:31:43,480
After all that searching,
I only found a dead man.

748
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,240
The only lead has gone cold.

749
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,760
Ping'an.

750
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,040
Ping'an.

751
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,630
Mr. Li.

752
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,920
I need your help again.

753
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,400
What is it this time?

754
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,080
Help me

755
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,350
find someone in Lingnan.

756
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,840
Who?

757
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,110
A Dong man called Tu.

758
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:11,910
Look for this man.

759
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,550
Tu from Dayu Ridge?

760
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:14,950
How do you know that?

761
00:32:16,777 --> 00:32:17,960
I've been gathering evidence

762
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,177
on He Youguang's embezzlement,

763
00:32:19,266 --> 00:32:20,800
and this man happens to be linked.

764
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,360
Oh,

765
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,400
what a coincidence!

766
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:26,377
Did you find him, then?

767
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,240
I did.

768
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,080
Where's he?

769
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,830
He died in a fire.

770
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:32,200
When did he die?

771
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,830
Ten years ago.

772
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,088
Your information is outdated.

773
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,720
He's not dead?

774
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,550
This man survived the fire,

775
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,733
but he's hiding.

776
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,070
He must know something

777
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,350
that could get him killed.

778
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,680
This is interesting.

779
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,960
We're looking for him,

780
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,755
and so is Li Shande.

781
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,480
This man

782
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,830
is the key.

783
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,350
Master Konglang,

784
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,720
I have a suggestion.

785
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,430
Glad to hear it.

786
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,288
Can we talk about something else?

787
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,830
We need to relax a little.

788
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,720
All right.
What would you like to talk about?

789
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,590
I'm not very good with words.

790
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,400
I don't know what to talk about

791
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,760
when asked that.

792
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,400
There's so much we could talk about.

793
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,390
Like?

794
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:31,000
Like music, chess, books, paintings,

795
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,480
poems, lyrics, verses, and elegies.

796
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,960
Or something

797
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,510
romantic.

798
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,350
Romantic?

799
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,720
Gou'er,

800
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,670
out.

801
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,550
Qilang, I was never in.

802
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:50,800
Get lost.

803
00:33:54,622 --> 00:33:55,830
Let's not talk about that.

804
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,590
We can talk about love.

805
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,590
- You see...
- But

806
00:34:00,355 --> 00:34:02,155
only after you're done with this matter.

807
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,000
Go back for now.

808
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,310
I'll have Luotuo look into

809
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,720
the lazy-eyed merchant.

810
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,070
No, you see.

811
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,733
Playing chess alone is boring...

812
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,070
Yunchuan.

813
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,430
Chief Scribe Zhao.

814
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:36,550
Why did you ask for me?

815
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,911
You put me in contact with a vendor,

816
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:40,960
and I got to buy

817
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,030
fine china and tea leaves,

818
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,755
so I came especially to thank you.

819
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,640
Have a seat.

820
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:46,910
Don't mention it.

821
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,480
Here's my token of gratitude.

822
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,550
Hope you'll accept it.

823
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,288
Please don't turn me down.

824
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,590
You have a wide network.

825
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,670
Even without my help,

826
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:06,000
you would still find good suppliers.

827
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,400
I haven't worked as a broker in years.

828
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,710
If I took a commission

829
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,280
by the broker's rules,

830
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,288
it wouldn't sit right with me.

831
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,710
You saved me

832
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,840
broker fees

833
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,670
and time.

834
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,840
For a merchant,

835
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,000
time is money.

836
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,150
If you don't accept this,

837
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,466
you're looking down on me.

838
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,400
Then I shall do as you wish.

839
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,977
Is there anything else, Yunchuan?

840
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,466
You may say it all at once.

841
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,070
You surely have sharp eyes.

842
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,070
The association is about to reshuffle,

843
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,755
and the chief's seat is still open.

844
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,840
I'd like to ask you

845
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:00,088
to recommend me to Inspector He.

846
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,840
Well,

847
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:15,670
that's a tall order.

848
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,155
Whether it works or not,

849
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,480
I'll always remember

850
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,510
your kindness.

851
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,000
I truly hope

852
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,110
you'll help me.

853
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,510
I'll offer you

854
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,150
thirty percent
of my caravan's net profit.

855
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,866
Here's the contract.

856
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,960
No rush.

857
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,360
I will

858
00:36:45,911 --> 00:36:46,910
give it a try first.

859
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,150
Sure, please do.

860
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,800
Mr. Zheng, you mentioned before

861
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,630
a lazy-eyed merchant
named Lazy Eye Feng.

862
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,550
We found

863
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,190
he has some story

864
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,444
with Lan of the Cockfight Arena.

865
00:37:03,466 --> 00:37:05,320
But there are many eyes there.

866
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,488
We Konglang Guild members
can't be seen there.

867
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,030
We'll need you

868
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,710
to go check it out.

869
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,760
But He Youguang

870
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,630
frequents the place.

871
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,800
Is it really fine

872
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,955
for me to meet Lan there?

873
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,150
Mr. Zheng, you discovered

874
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,510
that Tu was the key figure,

875
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,600
and Master Konglang was very pleased.

876
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,590
She said your talent

877
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,555
goes far beyond the drinking table.

878
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,030
She also praised your astuteness

879
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,030
and how you took a different approach

880
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,870
to turn the tide.

881
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,600
Master Konglang was
especially impressed.

882
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,000
Did she really say that?

883
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,030
Qilang,

884
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,190
Inspector He comes here very often.

885
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,670
What if

886
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,600
we run into him here?

887
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,640
Stop nagging.

888
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,511
You won't want to jinx it.

889
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,480
Say it, and it'll come true.

890
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,030
I'm sorry.

891
00:38:09,244 --> 00:38:10,230
Qilang, don't be scared.

892
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,190
You're astute enough

893
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,230
to turn the tide.

894
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,510
Guiyun.

895
00:38:19,222 --> 00:38:21,133
- Inspector He.
- What are you doing here?

896
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,320
I came to see you.

897
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,510
Me?

898
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,288
Then why were you walking away?

899
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,840
When I saw you,

900
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,840
I suddenly remembered

901
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,755
I bought you something

902
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:31,670
but forgot to bring it,
so I went to get it.

903
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,630
Guiyun,

904
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,670
we're close friends.

905
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,000
It's the thought that counts.

906
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,666
A gift or not, it doesn't matter.

907
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,066
Why were you looking for me?

908
00:38:46,177 --> 00:38:47,977
It's about my relationship problem.

909
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,990
Go on.

910
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,030
I admire Amita,

911
00:38:57,133 --> 00:38:59,150
so I've been visiting her often.

912
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,440
But my charm has somehow

913
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,070
worked on Lan Yu instead.

914
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,400
They both work under you.

915
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,840
I can't deal

916
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,920
with a love triangle.

917
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,622
What's so hard about that?

918
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,670
It means

919
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,070
you're attractive

920
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,110
and irresistible.

921
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,510
That's a good thing.

922
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,160
If I were you,

923
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,933
I would choose Lan Yu.

924
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,177
Why?

925
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,110
Think about it.

926
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,070
When you marry,

927
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,110
you should pick one who loves you.

928
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,710
I know

929
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,030
my goddaughter too well.

930
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:34,955
She's had a big temper
since she was a kid.

931
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,569
Besides, she knows martial arts skills,

932
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,260
and her favorite hobby
is beating people up.

933
00:39:38,266 --> 00:39:39,466
She beats anyone she sees.

934
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,960
You can't handle her.

935
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,800
Miss Lan Yu is different.

936
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,190
She's gentle, considerate,

937
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,280
and listens to you.

938
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,070
Let me ask you this.

939
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,466
Do you want to spend your whole life

940
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:50,760
getting beaten up every day

941
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,230
or enjoying a comfortable life?

942
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,630
Of course, a comfortable life.

943
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,070
Exactly.

944
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,444
Take Lan Yu.

945
00:39:58,955 --> 00:40:00,177
Luckily, you came here today.

946
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,000
Wait here a moment.

947
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,440
Lan.

948
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,870
Lan.

949
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:04,960
Come over.

950
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:06,870
Yes, Mr. He.

951
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,030
This is Guiyun.

952
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,240
Guiyun.

953
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,444
Nice to meet you, Lan.

954
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,400
Pick

955
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,280
the strongest fighting chicken

956
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,440
and let him try it.

957
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:19,355
Put it on my tab.

958
00:40:19,355 --> 00:40:19,840
Sure.

959
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,680
Very well.

960
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,030
You should try a round.

961
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,430
- I don't know how.
- It's fun.

962
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,320
See you, Inspector He.

963
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,350
Lan,

964
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,600
may I have a word with you?

965
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,160
Please.

966
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,688
I'd like to ask you about someone.

967
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,070
Inspector He?

968
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,030
No.

969
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,190
Someone you know,

970
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:55,000
Lazy Eye Feng.

971
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,150
I want to find

972
00:41:00,266 --> 00:41:01,555
a Sea Sail Fund broker

973
00:41:01,644 --> 00:41:02,630
through him.

974
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,160
Sea Sail Fund?

975
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:08,950
Yes.

976
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,230
This broker suddenly sold

977
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,733
2,000 shares of Sea Sail Fund.

978
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,880
Anyone holding the Sea Sail Fund

979
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,911
at the time was basically making money
in their sleep.

980
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,260
If someone hadn't known in advance

981
00:41:19,288 --> 00:41:20,755
that Sea Sail Fund was going off,

982
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,911
they couldn't have sold it off.

983
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,400
What are you implying?

984
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,244
Exactly what you heard.

985
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,840
Guiyun,

986
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,000
you're Inspector He's friend.

987
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,590
Why didn't you ask for his help

988
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,222
instead of me?

989
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,030
What's your reason?

990
00:41:44,955 --> 00:41:47,133
I didn't come all the way from Chang'an

991
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,670
to make friends.

992
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,800
I came for the truth.

993
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,480
I asked you

994
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,960
because I believe you'll put more effort

995
00:41:55,377 --> 00:41:56,711
than Inspector He does.

996
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,160
Why's that?

997
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,590
Because that broker

998
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:04,030
sold those 2,000 shares

999
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,888
to your father.

1000
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,150
Aren't you curious

1001
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,755
who the seller is?

1002
00:42:20,555 --> 00:42:21,720
You...

1003
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,840
Well,

1004
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
what's the person you want to find

1005
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,400
through Lazy Eye Feng?
