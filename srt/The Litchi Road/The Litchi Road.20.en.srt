=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,550
(A Radish Peeling Knife: One)

3
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,840
There's a traitor in Security Bureau.

4
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,150
(Nine Years Ago)

5
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:45,990
(Lu Huan.)

6
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,510
(I order you)

7
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,920
(to hurry to Pingkang Ward
to catch them.)

8
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,755
(Make sure there's no mistake.)

9
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,320
(Yes.)

10
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:25,660
(Zuihong Pavilion)

11
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,300
(Young Yun Qing)

12
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,150
Hurry and wash it.

13
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,150
Don't dawdle.

14
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,630
What are you staring at?

15
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,580
If you keep staring,

16
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,866
I'll feed your eyes to the dogs.

17
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,590
Little one.

18
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,000
(Ding Tong'er)
I bought you.

19
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:11,177
After peeling the radishes,
mop the floor.

20
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,022
You hear me?

21
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,310
Deputy Director Zheng is here.

22
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,270
Please.

23
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,830
Lead the way.

24
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,680
This way.

25
00:03:46,822 --> 00:03:48,511
(Tianbao)
These are two land deeds.

26
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,630
Both are fine residences

27
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,910
with good fengshui in Anren Ward.

28
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,310
You're

29
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,030
a core official in the court.

30
00:03:59,977 --> 00:04:02,259
(Security Bureau, Deputy Director Zheng)
Left Chancellor favors you.

31
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,777
Let you be in charge of Security Bureau.

32
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,080
But why did you

33
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,190
go to great lengths
to gain Right Chancellor's favor?

34
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,022
A wise man
serves under the right leader.

35
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,560
I also have a list of people

36
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,820
who have colluded with Left Chancellor

37
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,200
to impeach Right Chancellor.

38
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,240
I'll give it to Right Chancellor
as well.

39
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,140
(Name List)

40
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,533
I'll accept this generous gift

41
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,920
on behalf of Right Chancellor.

42
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,960
Yes.

43
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,750
If you have any instructions,

44
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,430
I will do my best

45
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,040
to fulfill them.

46
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,560
You

47
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,830
have a bright future.

48
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,270
Don't forget me in the future.

49
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,733
Thanks for your generous favor.

50
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,230
Get up.

51
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,080
What are you doing?

52
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,750
What are you doing? Let go!

53
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,360
Let go of me!

54
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,110
Let go of me.

55
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Do you think you could survive
by escaping?

56
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,390
Even if you escape,

57
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,720
outside isn't all that different
from here.

58
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,600
Dress up.
She needs to meet a distinguished guest.

59
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,670
Sir.

60
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,630
I won't disturb you.

61
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,040
I'll go to the lobby
and wait for your call.

62
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:56,488
Deputy Director Zheng, this way.

63
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,511
What's your name?

64
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
Dongxue.

65
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,830
Dongxue?

66
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,950
He called you.

67
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,710
Dongxue.

68
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,680
Come here.

69
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,360
This is Xinghua Pavilion's
gourd chicken.

70
00:07:54,822 --> 00:07:56,600
The skin is crispy
and the meat is tender.

71
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,830
Come on.

72
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,120
Let go of me!

73
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,840
Get out of the way!

74
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,100
=Episode 20=

75
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,710
Amita.

76
00:10:42,444 --> 00:10:44,066
Godfather, what brings you here?

77
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,320
I heard you found someone

78
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,240
at sea.

79
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,910
Didn't Lan Yu tell you?

80
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,150
He's just a fisherman.

81
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,570
There was a small misunderstanding

82
00:11:03,577 --> 00:11:04,644
during a fish deal earlier.

83
00:11:06,822 --> 00:11:08,030
How did such a small matter

84
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,510
alert Inspector's Office?

85
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,840
Is this man called Tu?

86
00:11:22,622 --> 00:11:24,630
Why did you bring him
to the association?

87
00:11:24,888 --> 00:11:26,688
Inspector's Office
is also looking for him.

88
00:11:27,155 --> 00:11:28,644
Why are you looking for him?

89
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:30,910
We heard

90
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,240
that Li Shande is looking for him.

91
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,780
This man knows

92
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,960
a shortcut out of Lingnan.

93
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,860
We can't let

94
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,000
Li Shande have him.

95
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,070
Don't worry.

96
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,444
I won't hand him to Li Shande.

97
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,510
Amita.

98
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,550
You probably don't know

99
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,960
how cunning Li Shande is.

100
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,390
You're no match for him.

101
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,630
How about this?

102
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,630
I'll take him away.

103
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,480
It's safer to keep him

104
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,320
in Inspector's Office.

105
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,840
Godfather.

106
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,480
I can't let you have Tu yet.

107
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,190
I heard he used to be

108
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,550
in charge of Sea Sail Fund.

109
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:16,470
Before the Qijing Pavilion fire,

110
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,660
a mysterious person dumped

111
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,511
2,000 shares of Sea Sail Fund
through him.

112
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,680
It's as if he predicted this fire.

113
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,380
I must find out

114
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,840
who this mysterious person is.

115
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,960
Qijing Pavilion's fire

116
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,533
and Sea Sail Fund's collapse

117
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,380
were major events

118
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,030
that shook Lingnan.

119
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,620
There are rumors all over the place.

120
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,066
Everyone told different versions.

121
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,030
We can't believe

122
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,600
in hearsay.

123
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,550
You don't know how chaotic it was.

124
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:56,977
Sea Sail Fund had large transactions

125
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,844
every day.

126
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,110
If you insist

127
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,000
it's related to Qijing Pavilion's fire,

128
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,022
isn't that nonsense?

129
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,080
In that case,

130
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,350
I can let you

131
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,533
take Tu away.

132
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,440
Alright.

133
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,660
I just want to ask

134
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,422
who this mysterious person is first.

135
00:13:13,755 --> 00:13:15,244
It'll put me feel at ease.

136
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,080
Inspector He, we found Tu.

137
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,780
Let go of me.

138
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,000
Go.

139
00:13:59,155 --> 00:14:01,577
- Save me, and I'll tell you the truth.
- No one can leave!

140
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,900
He's the one who dumped 2,000...

141
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,750
Shut up.

142
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,110
Speak.

143
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,200
He's the one who sold 2,000 shares.

144
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,600
I watched him

145
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,840
bring fire oil into Qijing Pavilion.

146
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,270
He burned Haihu to death!

147
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,200
This lunatic

148
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,310
is talking nonsense.

149
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,155
Do you believe him?

150
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,600
If he's talking nonsense,

151
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,177
why did you draw your sword?

152
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,630
He Youguang.

153
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,755
I have evidence against you.

154
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
If you kill me,

155
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,780
the evidence

156
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,333
will be made public.

157
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,960
Made public?

158
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,750
I won't kill him.

159
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,910
You have evidence.

160
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,360
That's a good thing.

161
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,080
Hurry and make it public!

162
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,000
He Youguang!

163
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,390
What are you trying to do?

164
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,160
Amita.

165
00:15:45,155 --> 00:15:47,320
You've been by my side
since you came of age.

166
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,960
I raised you for ten years.

167
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,200
You should know

168
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,088
how I treated you all this while.

169
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,190
The days I spent with you

170
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,200
are more than your own father.

171
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,870
Today,

172
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,960
do you believe him

173
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,240
or me?

174
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,280
You decide.

175
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,790
I had a glimmer of hope

176
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,620
that Tu wouldn't say

177
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,670
it was you,

178
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,870
but you killed him right away.

179
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,750
My hopes were all shattered.

180
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,440
Since that dagger,

181
00:16:45,177 --> 00:16:46,230
you've been lying to me.

182
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,080
You've been lying to me all along!

183
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,022
My father was your sworn brother.

184
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,720
Why did you kill him?

185
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,350
If I really killed your father,

186
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,222
why didn't I kill you too?

187
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,030
Why did I raise you?

188
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,750
For you to grow up

189
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,790
and settle old scores with me?

190
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Think about it. Use your brain.

191
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,560
Who

192
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,830
taught you
everything you know about life?

193
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:24,190
Who patiently taught you
how to do business?

194
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,470
And who made you

195
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,160
the chief of Hu Merchants' Association?

196
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,150
I raised you in luxury

197
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,590
for ten years.

198
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,222
Are you not satisfied?

199
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,880
What else do you want?

200
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,510
I would rather you kill me!

201
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,830
I know the truth now.

202
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,066
I want you to atone
for the sin with death!

203
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,590
What did you say?

204
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,390
How dare you

205
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,266
say that to me?

206
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,977
Atone for the sin with death?

207
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,550
Are you going to kill me?

208
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,440
You want to kill me?

209
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,240
Who do you think you are?

210
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,640
I'll warn you for the last time.

211
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,030
I can love you

212
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,622
and also ruin you.

213
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:40,710
Go.

214
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,560
He Youguang!

215
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,520
He Youguang.

216
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,350
Today, either you die

217
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,844
or I die.

218
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,440
You'll die then.

219
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,310
Kill her.

220
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,560
Bow and arrow!

221
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,880
Shoot her to death!

222
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,070
Shoot them all!

223
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,355
Someone, come.

224
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,080
Zhao.

225
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,480
Inspector He!

226
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,640
You're injured.

227
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,790
You're not injured, are you?

228
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm fine.

229
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,790
I killed everyone outside.

230
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,640
Inspector He, I'll take you outside.

231
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:50,870
Listen well.

232
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,000
Find out

233
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,640
who rescued Amita.

234
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,270
Tell Captain Yang

235
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,240
to kill everyone
who was in the association today.

236
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,350
Leave no one alive.

237
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,133
Put the entire city under lockdown.

238
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,750
Find Amita.

239
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,110
Yes.

240
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,790
An order from Inspector He.

241
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,266
Put the entire city under lockdown.

242
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,550
A secret manhunt

243
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,480
for Amita,
chief of Hu Merchants' Association.

244
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,150
- Yes!
- Yes!

245
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,870
Master.

246
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:22,780
Is the injury serious?

247
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,630
She'll live.

248
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,310
Who are you?

249
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,644
They call me Master Konglang.

250
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,720
We have never met before.

251
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,000
Why did you help me?

252
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,044
I want to make a deal with you.

253
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,400
He Youguang killed your father.

254
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,920
You can't beat him alone.

255
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,640
The whole city is looking for you.

256
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,288
You have nowhere to go except here.

257
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,510
I can help you,

258
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,960
but in exchange,

259
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,622
I want He Youguang's
evidence of corruption.

260
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,560
Miss.

261
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,350
It's alright now.

262
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,080
Miss.

263
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,160
Stop crying.

264
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,880
You can stay in the litchi garden

265
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,750
or follow me back to Dayu Ridge.

266
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,733
You won't be homeless.

267
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,800
Miss.

268
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,311
I promised to send you
to the embroidery house.

269
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,480
I'll keep my word.

270
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,480
It's all my fault.

271
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,088
Tu wouldn't have died
if it weren't for me.

272
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,110
Uncle Tu once told me

273
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,310
this day would come sooner or later.

274
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,600
He said he could escape for a while,

275
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,350
but not forever.

276
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,510
Tu not only knew

277
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,160
Dayu Ridge's shortcut

278
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,790
but also some secrets

279
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,400
that led to his death.

280
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,640
This

281
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,733
was a catastrophe he was meant to face.

282
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,080
It's just

283
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,640
that I

284
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,470
never even got to see him

285
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,640
before he died.

286
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,510
So all this effort

287
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,000
was for nothing.

288
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,830
Despite all our efforts,

289
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,630
we still can't find

290
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,590
Dayu Ridge's path.

291
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,040
Mr. Li.

292
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
How about I ride a horse

293
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,440
to Dayu Ridge to find it?

294
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:47,230
Dayu Ridge is enclosed
by cliffs on three sides,

295
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,688
blocking three directions.

296
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,270
Only a narrow water basin

297
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,150
stretches to the east,

298
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,440
leading to Qianzhou.

299
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,888
The courier road is narrow.

300
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,680
Green mountains
stand opposite each other,

301
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,777
covering most of the sky.

302
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,422
It's hard to see anything in this place,

303
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,590
much less find the path.

304
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,830
We can only hurry up

305
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,960
and try our very best

306
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,400
to shorten the two days.

307
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,510
The more anxious we are,

308
00:25:16,577 --> 00:25:17,911
the more we have to slow down

309
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:18,844
in a place like this.

310
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,590
If we make a mistake,

311
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,790
we'll lose everything.

312
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,590
If that's the case,

313
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,590
there's nothing we can do.

314
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,280
Be careful.

315
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,740
(Yi'an Embroidery)

316
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,590
Let me see.

317
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,920
Pay attention to this color.

318
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,320
Madam.

319
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,240
Lan...

320
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,830
Lan already told me.

321
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,840
Yes.

322
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,430
This girl

323
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,066
looks quite cute.

324
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,160
Does she have a name?

325
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,320
No.

326
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,200
You don't even have a name?

327
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,470
You're clever.

328
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,311
How about calling you Hui?

329
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,760
Sure.

330
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,640
Alright, Hui.

331
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,270
Don't be afraid.

332
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,622
It's alright if you can't see.

333
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,200
Embroidery is a craft

334
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:30,644
that relies on the heart.

335
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,110
Come here.

336
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,160
(Yi'an Embroidery)

337
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,160
Let me see your hands.

338
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,320
They're quite soft.

339
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,222
Have you learned embroidery before?

340
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,720
I learned it myself.

341
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,640
What have you embroidered?

342
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,288
This is what I embroidered myself.

343
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,110
Let me see.

344
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,160
This needlework is really good.

345
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,000
You embroidered this?

346
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,088
She has a good foundation.

347
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,444
Alright, I'll take her in.

348
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,310
Kowtow to Madam.

349
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,430
Thank you, Madam.

350
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,910
Alright, darling.

351
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:14,760
Get up.

352
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,200
Thank your savior.

353
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,560
No need to thank me.

354
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,800
From now on,

355
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,310
live here

356
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,640
and work on the craft.

357
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,260
Alright.

358
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,466
I'll give this back to you.

359
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,240
Mr. Li.

360
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,000
You can have this handkerchief.

361
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,710
Uncle Tu

362
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,355
carved the pattern for me.

363
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,670
He said this pattern

364
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:40,520
means hope.

365
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,480
Really?

366
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,190
Alright.

367
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,910
Hope.

368
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,550
What is this?

369
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,680
This is Dong people's custom.

370
00:28:17,711 --> 00:28:19,733
They draw the direction
of the hometown's mountains

371
00:28:19,777 --> 00:28:21,466
on the ground
during the memorial ceremony

372
00:28:21,488 --> 00:28:23,520
to make it easier
for the soul to find its way home.

373
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,040
Tu.

374
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,150
Great Shaman.

375
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,430
Look.

376
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,910
Look.

377
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:49,870
Is this

378
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,960
the shape of Dayu Ridge?

379
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,880
Yes, it is.

380
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,020
(Dayu Ridge)

381
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,400
This should be a shortcut.

382
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,310
Tu

383
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
had been thinking about going home.

384
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,880
If there's no problem with this path,

385
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,060
it can make up

386
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,160
for two days of travel.

387
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:43,950
We can

388
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,150
start experimenting!

389
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,030
Good.

390
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,000
We can start experimenting!

391
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,950
Yan.

392
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,000
Mr. Li.

393
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,920
Mr. Li, time waits for no one.

394
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,100
We found

395
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,910
Dayu Ridge's path,

396
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,688
but only through taking that path
can we know

397
00:30:01,688 --> 00:30:02,500
if it's passable.

398
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,150
Yes.

399
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,630
So I thought I'd scout it

400
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,500
right away.

401
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,510
Once I get through,

402
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,911
I'll immediately send a pigeon

403
00:30:07,911 --> 00:30:08,670
to inform you.

404
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,550
I'll then head north

405
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,870
to gather all my comrades
before you start your journey.

406
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,070
Good idea.

407
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,777
That's what I came here to tell you.

408
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,430
After I hear from you,

409
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,000
I'll set out immediately to find you.

410
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,190
Remember.

411
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,640
After passing through Dayu Ridge,

412
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,640
head toward Chang'an from Mei Pass

413
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,990
and meet up
with the litchi transport team.

414
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,840
Mr. Li, don't worry.

415
00:30:26,844 --> 00:30:28,711
My peers will wait
for the litchi transport team

416
00:30:28,711 --> 00:30:29,920
at the corresponding post station.

417
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,222
I'll ride my horse to the post station
closest to Chang'an

418
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,400
to run the last leg.

419
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,622
I'll make sure you return
with fresh litchis.

420
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,720
Thank you.

421
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,550
We must make sure

422
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,440
this relay race is flawless.

423
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,630
If you need any fees,

424
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,870
I'll ask Mr. Su to set out in advance
to distribute money

425
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,400
to various money posts along the route.

426
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,666
You can just go and collect it.

427
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,177
I'll issue the certificate right away.

428
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,133
I'll leave right away.

429
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,150
Be safe!

430
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,240
Everyone.

431
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,590
Everyone.

432
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,080
Listen to me.

433
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,240
Stay calm.

434
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,440
How can we be calm?

435
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,920
There's no trace of Ms. Amita
these days.

436
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,430
She dispatched my fleet

437
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,580
to Sasan to transport glass

438
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,350
and asked me
to load a ship with urgent goods,

439
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,510
but now there's no news.

440
00:31:25,711 --> 00:31:27,470
The goods on my ship are all going bad!

441
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,320
Yes!

442
00:31:28,866 --> 00:31:30,279
She reassigned my fleet too.

443
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,520
Who's supposed to take over now?

444
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,769
Amita asked me to procure goods.
The price has been set,

445
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,910
but the goods haven't arrived.

446
00:31:34,911 --> 00:31:35,844
If this isn't resolved,

447
00:31:35,866 --> 00:31:37,422
my reputation will be ruined!

448
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,390
Yes.

449
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,920
She was the one who mediated

450
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,640
Hu Merchants' Association's dispute.

451
00:31:41,644 --> 00:31:42,639
She should also mediate

452
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
with Maritime Trade Office
and Inspector's Office.

453
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,670
There's no one in charge.

454
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,950
What should we do with this mess?

455
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:47,540
Yes!

456
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,230
- Yes!
- Yes!

457
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,790
Where do you put us by doing this?

458
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,920
Listen to me!

459
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,920
I've recorded all your affairs.

460
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,480
I'll give you

461
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,310
an explanation in the next few days.

462
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,560
How many days?

463
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,870
Chief Scribe Zhao.

464
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,670
Hu Merchants' Association

465
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,520
is in turmoil.

466
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,820
Everyone knows Amita

467
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,288
had a falling out with Inspector He.

468
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,960
There's no one in charge.

469
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,430
We have several ships of goods
stuck at the border,

470
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,844
waiting for her to go
to Maritime Trade Office for inspection.

471
00:32:17,844 --> 00:32:19,400
Am I going to lose

472
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,310
the funds I invested earlier?

473
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:25,222
Why are you so impatient?

474
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,150
Amita isn't here,

475
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,066
but Inspector's Office is still there,
right?

476
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,990
Besides, Amita's absence

477
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,480
may not be a bad thing for you.

478
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,577
Please make it clear.

479
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,750
The vacancy of a chief

480
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:45,266
has caused panic among people

481
00:32:45,288 --> 00:32:46,400
and makes things difficult.

482
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,950
The priority now

483
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,110
is to get the association back on track.

484
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,680
We need to appoint

485
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,590
an acting chief.

486
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,150
I think

487
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,160
you have the potential to be the chief.

488
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,110
Thanks for the support.

489
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,750
Thanks for giving me the opportunity.

490
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,590
I didn't give you an opportunity,

491
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,790
You're lucky, young and promising.

492
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,790
You're also grateful
and know how to repay kindness.

493
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,720
I know this best.

494
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,390
Chief Scribe Zhao, this is the deed

495
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,400
for the caravan's 30% net profit share.

496
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,244
I hope you'll keep it for me.

497
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:45,920
Chief Scribe Zhao.

498
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,720
Allow me to ask one more question.

499
00:33:49,711 --> 00:33:50,977
A new chief will be elected

500
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,110
in a few days.

501
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,160
Will I, the acting chief,

502
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,920
be replaced by someone else

503
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,160
within a few days?

504
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,110
Anything is possible,

505
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,720
but Inspector's Office has the final say

506
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,440
on who the new chief will be.

507
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,590
Thanks for the tip.

508
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:16,070
If things do turn out as you predict,

509
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,911
I'll look to you for guidance
and follow your lead!

510
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,670
Search here.

511
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,720
Yes.

512
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:29,990
And here.

513
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:31,550
Go out and stand still.

514
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,030
Inspector He.

515
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,590
You must rest.

516
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,440
Don't get angry.

517
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,710
Zhao.

518
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:02,910
Inspector He.

519
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,920
Did you find Amita?

520
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,244
We're still searching for her.

521
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,480
Since when

522
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,070
did it become so difficult

523
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,150
to catch someone in Lingnan?

524
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,030
Inspector He, calm down.

525
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,230
The city is under lockdown.

526
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,150
Amita can't get away.

527
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,790
Her capture

528
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,070
is just a matter of time.

529
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,110
Get out.

530
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
Keep searching for her.

531
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,000
Inspector He.

532
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,440
Something

533
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,960
is troubling me.

534
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,888
Amita isn't here.

535
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,880
Hu merchants

536
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,790
are causing chaos

537
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:56,920
in Hu Merchants' Association.

538
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,480
I don't care.

539
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,533
I don't have time to deal with them.

540
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,230
Inspector He, Lingnan...

541
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,070
No.

542
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,150
Most of Lingnan's taxes

543
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,760
come from the seaport.

544
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,840
Hu Merchants' Association

545
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,550
can't go a day without a chief.

546
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:25,030
If there's any rumor in the market,

547
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,840
the merchants won't come,

548
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,630
which will be bad for us.

549
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,355
Go on.

550
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,760
I have a solution

551
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:38,110
that gives us the best of both worlds.

552
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,960
Didn't those Hu merchants say

553
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,320
they have no chief?

554
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,000
We'll give them an acting chief.

555
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,800
At the same time,

556
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,030
it'll send a signal

557
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,577
that Amita
may be unable to be re-elected.

558
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,230
Anyone

559
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,320
could be the next chief.

560
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,280
This way,

561
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,830
it can downplay

562
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,480
Amita's disappearance

563
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:07,060
and keep those Hu merchants

564
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,070
on our side.

565
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,920
Merchants value profit.

566
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,000
Everyone wants to be a chief.

567
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,920
Who will care

568
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,630
about Li Shande's transport by then?

569
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,280
Are you saying

570
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,840
that the acting chief put forward
is just a bait?

571
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,190
These Hu merchants

572
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,920
will take the bait.

573
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,150
When the time comes,

574
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,840
not even nine bulls

575
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,230
can drag

576
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Su Liang and Li Shande back.

577
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,710
You're wise.

578
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,244
Who do you want to appoint?

579
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,190
The appointment of this acting chief

580
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,866
is very particular.

581
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,200
First,

582
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,177
they must have no alliances.

583
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,440
With alliances comes confidence.

584
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,000
They can still survive without us.

585
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,360
Second, no prestige.

586
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,230
With prestige, the acting chief

587
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
can easily become the real chief.

588
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,550
As time goes by,

589
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,840
they'll repeat Amita's mistakes.

590
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,550
We have to choose the kind

591
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,320
with no alliances and prestige.

592
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,030
Someone

593
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,430
who only obeys us.

594
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,840
Just say

595
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,280
you want to appoint a loser.

596
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,920
Out of all of them,

597
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,510
Xiao Yunchuan is

598
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,030
the biggest loser.

599
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,840
Zhao.

600
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,933
Let me ask you a question.

601
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,100
Why do you think so highly

602
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,590
of Xiao Yunchuan?

603
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,230
Inspector He, you...

604
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,511
I'm only thinking
of what's best for you.

605
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,880
As long as the above requirements
are met,

606
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,030
anyone can do it.

607
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,840
He's nothing more

608
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,630
than a puppet

609
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,670
you set up in the association.

610
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,230
I'll go to the city gate
to continue the search.

611
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,280
Stop.

612
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,844
Let's do as you say.

613
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,240
Yes.

614
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:33,910
Ms. Amita.

615
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:39,910
Ms. Amita.

616
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,320
You don't have to serve me anymore.

617
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,720
You betrayed me

618
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,266
and blocked an attack for me.

619
00:40:51,688 --> 00:40:54,266
We have nothing to do with each other
from now on.

620
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,840
Ms. Amita.

621
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,280
Ms. Amita.

622
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:02,030
I'm just afraid
Inspector He will discover

623
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,960
your secret meeting with Tu,

624
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,955
and you'll have a falling out
with Inspector He.

625
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,620
After all, he's your protector...

626
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,030
He killed my father.

627
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,320
Ms. Amita.

628
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,510
I didn't know

629
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,100
your father's death

630
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,320
was related to Inspector He.

631
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,070
Back then,

632
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,440
I was helpless

633
00:41:32,755 --> 00:41:35,488
and had to sell myself on the street
to bury my mother.

634
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,190
Inspector He bought me

635
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,880
and buried my mother.

636
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,790
Later, he sent me

637
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:48,920
to your side

638
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,920
to take care of you.

639
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,880
He asked me

640
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,700
to report

641
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,533
your every move to him.

642
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,960
I dare not disobey Inspector He,

643
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,155
much less hide anything from him.

644
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:12,920
I was blind

645
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,577
to treat you as a sister.

646
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,380
=The Litchi Road=

647
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,720
It works.

648
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,680
It works.

649
00:42:31,755 --> 00:42:34,044
The last piece
of the strategy for litchi transport

650
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,480
is complete.

651
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:40,030
- Good!
- Good!

652
00:42:43,044 --> 00:42:44,110
Help me take someone away.

653
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,400
There's no need for this.

654
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,960
He's one of us.

655
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:52,177
Who do you want me to take away?

656
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,680
Amita.

657
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,800
Amita?

658
00:42:55,111 --> 00:42:56,160
I want to go to Chang'an

659
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:57,911
and meet Left Chancellor.

660
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,550
Are you going back to Chang'an?

661
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,680
This

662
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:05,920
will decide

663
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,960
whether I live or die.
