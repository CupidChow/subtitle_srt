Everyone

3
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,590
has few opportunities.

4
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,400
What's wrong with me

5
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,050
fighting and taking a gamble

6
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,280
for a chance?

7
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,780
At Right Chancellor's side,

8
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,933
no one will appreciate
your humility and generosity

9
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,911
if you don't fight or compete.

10
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,810
You'll just get trampled underfoot

11
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,540
and die miserably.

(Chief Eunuch Wang)

15
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,060
Nincompoop.

16
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,300
Are you trying to kill me?

17
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,155
Chief Eunuch Wang.

18
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:27,890
Calm down.

19
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,977
Chief Eunuch Wang.

20
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,300
Please forgive me this time.

21
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,940
Are you dead?
You're just standing there.

22
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,260
Chief Eunuch Wang!

23
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,333
Chief Eunuch Wang.

24
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,333
Right Chancellor
sent someone to urge you again.

25
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,900
You're doomed when I get back.

26
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,960
Usually,

27
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,770
people are scrambling

28
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,880
to get

29
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,666
this purchasing job.

30
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,100
Now that the opportunity has come,

31
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,600
why is no one taking it?

32
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,560
Right Chancellor.

33
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:26,860
White wax is expensive.

34
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,520
Imperial Treasury
disbursed less than it did

35
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,830
in previous purchases

36
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,670
by Imperial Household Department.

37
00:03:35,955 --> 00:03:37,340
The money is too little, huh?

38
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,190
You can't make a profit,

39
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,020
so you're unwilling to share

40
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,660
His Majesty's burdens.

41
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,390
Sharing the burden for His Majesty

42
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,330
is my duty,

43
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,100
but the budget this time

44
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,380
is less than 10%,

45
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,710
which is quite difficult.

46
00:04:03,088 --> 00:04:06,430
I'm incompetent and can't do the job.

47
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,920
Please punish me, Right Chancellor.

48
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,050
What about the rest?

49
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,590
Who is willing to take on this job?

50
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,110
Step outside Chang'an,

51
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,688
and you'll see
countless starving people.

52
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,720
You hold golden bowls,

53
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,420
but are picky.

54
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,470
If you don't want to eat, don't eat!

55
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,460
I

56
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,360
want

57
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,288
to ask for a reward.

58
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:43,240
What do you want?

59
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,260
I ask

60
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,733
for an opportunity
to relieve your worries.

61
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,760
Alright.

62
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,870
Fortune is found in danger.

63
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,440
Interesting.

64
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,580
Those who know me

65
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,266
understand my worries.

66
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,580
You can have this opportunity.

67
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,222
Thank you, Right Chancellor.

Attendant Yu.

70
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:40,770
Mr. Li.

71
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,890
I can calculate

72
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,580
the transport cost again

73
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,044
to try to reduce some expenses.

74
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,300
Mr. Li.

75
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,490
We work for His Majesty.

76
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,860
First of all,

77
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,360
we need to do this job well

78
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,200
and successfully.

79
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,770
The rest are just details.

80
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,380
Especially the budget.

81
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,866
You can't limit it to a certain amount.

82
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,380
You should know
that claiming less but spending more

83
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,300
is called overspending.

84
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:18,422
- Attendant Yu.
- Attendant Yu.

85
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,280
Claiming more but spending less

86
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,380
is called surplus.

87
00:07:25,466 --> 00:07:27,577
Overspending
is a sign of poor performance.

88
00:07:27,644 --> 00:07:30,600
Having a surplus
is the result of effective planning.

89
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,380
Tell me.

90
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,380
Our litchi transport job

91
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,010
has a long journey

92
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,340
with many uncontrollable factors.

93
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,970
If something goes wrong

94
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,160
and the budget is stuck,

95
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,040
you'll overspend easily.

96
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,820
In the end,

97
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:47,440
if we need to pay an extra one guan,

98
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,190
do you think I should pay for it

99
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,950
or you should pay for it?

100
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,140
Yes.

101
00:07:55,777 --> 00:07:58,320
We should set aside some
for unexpected spending.

102
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,080
You have experience.

103
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,755
I'll report it this way first.

104
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,940
Don't worry. Think about it slowly.

105
00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:08,822
Don't make any mistakes.

106
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,244
We have to leave more budget.

107
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,240
You're right.

108
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,850
If this transport method works,

109
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,700
we will support it.

110
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,050
But Li Shande's plan

111
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,888
has a big drawback.

112
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,190
It's too economical.

113
00:08:40,422 --> 00:08:42,960
This economical method doubles the risk.

114
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,860
The transportation

115
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,340
requires not only speed,

116
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,740
but also stability.

117
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,900
A tired horse is prone to fail.

118
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,980
In my opinion,

119
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,540
a post station every 30 km

120
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,950
is inappropriate.

121
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,180
It can be shortened

122
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,950
to a change of rider and horse
every 15 km.

123
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,400
Add more post stations too.

124
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,440
This post station

125
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,711
also needs a place to stay
and a place to feed the horses.

126
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,740
It needs running water and well water.

127
00:09:19,044 --> 00:09:20,422
Each of these post stations

128
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:23,800
needs to prepare
at least three good horses.

129
00:09:23,844 --> 00:09:24,933
At least...

130
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:29,330
Two riders.

131
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,900
This post station

132
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,520
also needs to build a granary

133
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,380
to store food for several months

134
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,860
and two cooks

135
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,690
to take turns preparing meals every day.

136
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,250
In case the food isn't fresh one day

137
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,377
and causes a stomachache,

138
00:09:45,422 --> 00:09:47,533
or if the horse
isn't obedient and gets sick,

139
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,860
we can still remedy it.

140
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,733
We also need to prepare some medicines

141
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,150
for emergencies.

142
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,360
This budget

143
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,180
will far exceed Li Shande's

144
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,822
previous calculations.

145
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,040
Attendant Yu.

146
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,020
If it's done well,

147
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,444
it's fine, no matter how much you spend.

148
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,190
If things are done badly,

149
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,420
it's an offense,
no matter how little you spend.

150
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,711
There's no room for mistake.

151
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,430
The transportation budget will probably

152
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,370
have to be multiplied several times

153
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,020
to be considered safe.

154
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,844
What do you think?

155
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,780
I understand

156
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,300
your concerns.

157
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,690
Everyone is seeking stability

158
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,266
for the litchi transport.

159
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,250
I

160
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:54,970
support you,

161
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,350
but...

162
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,340
I don't think

163
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,300
your budget

164
00:11:05,755 --> 00:11:07,450
is safe enough.

165
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,080
Why not

166
00:11:13,888 --> 00:11:15,650
multiply it again?

167
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,740
When I saw the notebook

168
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,111
Li Shande wrote with great effort,

169
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,830
I felt sorry for him
for being assigned such a doomed task,

170
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,280
but he completed the job

171
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,300
with clear logic

172
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:33,520
and perfect efficiency.

173
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,400
That made me
eager to help him find a solution.

174
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,660
But I didn't expect him

175
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,844
to be in cahoots with Attendant Yu.

176
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,020
This big-headed fool.

177
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,800
Regardless of whether he's with him,

178
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,860
anyone who's related...

179
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
Anyone who's related
to this turtle

180
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,940
won't end well.

181
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,570
This turtle has a big appetite.

182
00:11:56,488 --> 00:11:58,050
The cost of the litchi transport

183
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,360
is probably going to snowball.

184
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,860
Although it was a doomed task,

185
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,422
it had a chance of survival.

186
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,970
Now that Attendant Yu is involved,

187
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:13,180
Litchi Envoy has embarked
on a path of no return.

188
00:12:13,688 --> 00:12:15,990
He thought the silver token
that Right Chancellor gave him

189
00:12:16,022 --> 00:12:17,155
would protect him.

190
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,220
He didn't even think

191
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,400
about the fact
that he was the litchi transport envoy.

192
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,140
If he messes up,

193
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:32,977
Right Chancellor only needs
to take back the silver token.

194
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,440
And there will be no connection

195
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,700
between the two of them.

196
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,260
You're absolutely right.

197
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,711
Attendant Yu can also protect himself.

198
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,380
Li Shande

199
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:53,911
arranged today's meeting.

200
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,230
Li Shande also
delegated everyone's duties.

201
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,960
Li Shande also led the discussion

202
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,420
on the transport method
and its improvement.

203
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:07,911
The Softshell Turtle On Top already said

204
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,660
he's only responsible for serving

205
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,288
and helping everyone solve problems.

206
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,380
His statement is flawlessly worded.

207
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,680
If it succeeds,
he'll get all the credit.

208
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,420
If it fails,

209
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,977
that's because
Li Shande didn't do a good job.

210
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,510
I felt

211
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,860
your support.

212
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,510
I have to travel tomorrow.

213
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,020
Really. Please go back.

214
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,420
Mr. Li, bravo.

215
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,340
- Good.
- Good.

216
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,850
Congratulations

217
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,760
on the transport method.

218
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,540
We used to get drunk together.

219
00:13:55,555 --> 00:13:57,288
Now, he thrives like a fish in water.

220
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,100
Although he hasn't make it big,

221
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,244
things and people have changed.

222
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,333
Liangyuan.

223
00:14:11,444 --> 00:14:13,080
Where is your original intention?

224
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,133
Han.

225
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,400
Take care.

226
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,050
You're generous.

227
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,244
When you become successful,
don't forget us.

228
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,350
Yes.

229
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,870
When you become successful,

230
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,370
don't forget

231
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,620
us old friends from Shanglin Office.

232
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,700
- Yes.
- Yes.

233
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,410
Liangyuan.

234
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,610
Don't forget

235
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,810
our years of friendship.

236
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,244
Our friendship is stronger than gold.

237
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,660
Yes.

238
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,980
I've been in Shanglin Office

239
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,200
for half my life.

240
00:14:54,355 --> 00:14:56,133
I don't understand other principles.

241
00:14:56,155 --> 00:14:57,590
But I know

242
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,940
the peach is crisp when a plum
is grafted onto the peach tree.

243
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,044
The peach grows large if an apricot
is grafted onto the peach tree.

244
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,460
But no matter what,

245
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,340
it remains a peach.

246
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,650
Although I got
Right Chancellor's silver token,

247
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,200
I'm still

248
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,260
Li Shande.

249
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:14,355
Nothing has changed.

250
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,000
So I really can't take

251
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,890
your stuff.

252
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,930
Take them back.
I really can't take them.

253
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:20,720
Please go back.

254
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,240
Well, no wonder

255
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,150
your father can get things done.

256
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,020
Even if your father is an official,

257
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,422
he's still
the same honest and good-hearted man.

258
00:15:33,444 --> 00:15:34,880
Yes.

259
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,060
Such integrity is admirable.

260
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,111
No wonder
Right Chancellor appreciates you.

261
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,730
Please go back, Sirs.

262
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,450
Well...

263
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,420
Well...

264
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,260
We'll leave you alone then.

265
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,730
Yes, we'll leave you alone.

266
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,020
Let's go.

267
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,555
Alright.

268
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,830
Liangyuan, farewell.

269
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:02,950
Farewell.

270
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,060
Follow up.

271
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,460
Coming.

272
00:16:24,844 --> 00:16:25,688
Come on. Let's go.

273
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,700
(Dayu Ridge)

274
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,110
Inspector He.

275
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,400
Lingnan's court assembly envoy sent news

276
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,860
that Litchi Envoy, Li Shande,

277
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,560
received
Right Chancellor's silver token.

278
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:17,980
He's coming to Lingnan

279
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,380
with Litchi Inspector, Attendant Yu.

280
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,580
They're accompanied by...

281
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,540
Who else?

282
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,940
Don't hesitate.

283
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,444
The Hu merchants's representative

284
00:17:28,622 --> 00:17:30,600
appointed by Right Chancellor, Amita.

285
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,140
No wonder

286
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,420
we can't find Amita at sea.

287
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,066
We were looking in the wrong direction.

288
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,620
Li Shande's plan

289
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,660
actually helped Amita

290
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,420
enter Chang'an.

291
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,940
You two get out.

292
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:52,700
Yes.

293
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,380
Yes.

294
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,620
Chief Scribe Zhao.

295
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,180
You don't need

296
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,111
to be so jumpy.

297
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,460
We'll talk

298
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,955
about your matter later.

299
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,340
What matters most now

300
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,660
is that Amita

301
00:18:18,955 --> 00:18:20,660
has already fled to Chang'an,

302
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,133
far away from trouble.

303
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,900
Why come back to Lingnan?

304
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,000
Is she not afraid of death?

305
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,580
Does this

306
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:38,866
have anything to do
with Right Chancellor?

307
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,400
Inspector He.

308
00:18:44,777 --> 00:18:47,377
You're a local official
appointed by imperial decree.

309
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,860
Even if Amita sowed discord

310
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,866
between you and Right Chancellor,

311
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,733
he would have
to go through official channels

312
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,140
to punish you.

313
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,060
He needs to ask His Majesty

314
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,100
to dismiss you

315
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,500
before summoning you to the capital
to sentence you.

316
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,220
There's no way he would only send

317
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,377
these few people
to take punitive action against you.

318
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,300
Besides,

319
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,380
Lingnan is your territory.

320
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,820
Now, you also

321
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,220
hold the military tally.

322
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,780
Why should we be afraid of these people?

323
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,380
In my opinion,

324
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,820
Right Chancellor is probably eyeing

325
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,300
the litchi transport's profits

326
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,088
and sent Attendant Yu
to keep an eye on it.

327
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,580
Attendant Yu

328
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,860
is known as the Softshell Turtle On Top.

329
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,466
He's more familiar with corrupt
officials' methods than we are.

330
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:46,888
Corrupt officials are all the same.

331
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,820
They all know when to turn a blind eye.

332
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,220
Since the litchi transport

333
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,933
is already a done deal,

334
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,620
let Attendant Yu do whatever he wants.

335
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,420
We just need to serve him well.

336
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,460
He'll put in a good word for us

337
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,955
in front of Right Chancellor.

338
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,340
If they really sent

339
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,700
some rigid fool,

340
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,980
who knows what would go wrong

341
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,940
even if

342
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,288
Amita sowed discord.

343
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,500
Anyway,

344
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,020
calculate their arrival time

345
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,666
and make proper arrangements.

346
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:26,820
Yes.

347
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,180
Mr. Li.

348
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,380
Why are you depressed

349
00:20:33,555 --> 00:20:35,044
when we almost reached Lingnan?

350
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,620
The weather

351
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,900
is even hotter than when I left.

352
00:20:42,822 --> 00:20:44,688
It's not a good place to store ice.

353
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,820
When we start transporting the litchis,

354
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,977
the weather might ruin things.

355
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,740
I read your writing.

356
00:20:54,866 --> 00:20:56,700
It seemed alright on paper,

357
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,460
but this entire trip

358
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,900
made me think that transporting litchis

359
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,688
is difficult.

360
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,060
But Mr. Li,

361
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,820
don't worry.

362
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,380
We're assigned

363
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,740
by Right Chancellor this time.

364
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,380
As long as we work together,

365
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,220
there's nothing we can accomplish.

366
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,300
We can ask

367
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,060
Inspector's Office

368
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,488
to help with operational matters.

369
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,844
It's good enough
if they don't cause trouble.

370
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,380
Do you

371
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,700
have a grudge

372
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:32,540
against Inspector's Office?

373
00:21:33,111 --> 00:21:35,222
It was just a minor misunderstanding.

374
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,620
Yes, a minor...

375
00:21:38,222 --> 00:21:39,488
A minor misunderstanding.

376
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,140
With Right Chancellor's silver token

377
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,100
and your help,

378
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,700
Inspector's Office might help us.

379
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,260
When we get to Lingnan,

380
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,660
let's go to Inspector He's place

381
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,400
and have a good chat.

382
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,540
Welcome to Lingnan,

383
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,377
Inspector and Litchi Envoy!

384
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,020
(Inspector's Office)

385
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,488
Is it Inspector Yu?

386
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,580
Inspector Yu.

387
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:50,940
I've long heard about you.

388
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,660
I didn't expect you

389
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,500
to be so handsome, young, and promising.

390
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,540
I heard you oversee

391
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:00,140
the procurement and planning

392
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,900
of Noble Consort's birthday banquet.

393
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,060
Incredible.

394
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,140
I'm honored

395
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,780
to meet you today.

396
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,860
I've heard of you for a long time.

397
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,460
You ruled the seas back then.

398
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,620
You dominated the sea

399
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,020
with your brothers.

400
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,380
Now,

401
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,066
you became Lingnan's local magistrate,

402
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,980
protecting the people.

403
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,740
What a wonderful story.

404
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,820
Inspector He.

405
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,460
Actually,

406
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,180
I wanted to visit you for a long time,

407
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,860
but I've been in the palace.

408
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,740
We finally met.

409
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,700
I

410
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,929
must have a good chat

411
00:23:52,355 --> 00:23:54,660
about old times with you.

412
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,620
Inspector Yu.

413
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,740
Have we met before?

414
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,940
You're concerned about Chang'an.

415
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,340
Surely we've crossed paths

416
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,060
in many matters.

417
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,860
Maybe we met before.

418
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,380
Look.

419
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,820
As soon as I saw you,

420
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,740
I found you familiar.

421
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,977
I feel like we've met before.

422
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,740
Fate must have bound us long ago.

423
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,060
Mr. Li.

424
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:38,288
(Order of Tang's Duke of Wei)
Right Chancellor's silver token indeed.

425
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,300
Mr. Li.

426
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,977
As the old saying goes,

427
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,100
a single day apart
feels as long as three autumns.

428
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,111
We haven't seen each other
for so many days.

429
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,140
How many autumns have passed?

430
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,980
It's been a long journey.

431
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,555
Don't worry about it.

432
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,700
Amita.

433
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,100
Since you left,

434
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,620
I worry about you

435
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,820
every day.

436
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,088
Now all is well. You're back.

437
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,780
My heart

438
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,180
feels relieved.

439
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,380
You have to promise me

440
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,060
that you won't

441
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,260
go so far anymore.

442
00:25:31,511 --> 00:25:32,955
Don't worry, Godfather.

443
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,460
I don't plan to leave again this time.

444
00:25:42,044 --> 00:25:43,177
Where's Lan Yu?

445
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,980
Why would I make things difficult
for a servant?

446
00:25:46,355 --> 00:25:47,311
I let her go.

447
00:25:47,911 --> 00:25:48,822
Inspector He.

448
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,260
Please come here, Sirs.

449
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,660
We prepared

450
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,740
a few delicacies

451
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,180
to welcome you.

452
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,580
Yes.

453
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,333
Hearing that you two are coming,

454
00:26:06,444 --> 00:26:08,088
we're eager to welcome you.

455
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,820
I believe you two have seen

456
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,500
Inspector He's raging enthusiasm.

457
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,300
Let's discuss

458
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,620
the litchi transport while we eat.

459
00:26:25,266 --> 00:26:27,444
There's a severe drought
in Longdong this year.

460
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,980
His Majesty issued
a resource allocation edict,

461
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:32,733
ordering civil and military officials

462
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,700
to save public expenses.

463
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,060
His Majesty
is considerate of the people.

464
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,100
To set an example for everyone,

465
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,100
even the renovation of Huaqing Pond

466
00:26:46,955 --> 00:26:48,460
was stopped.

467
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,533
Wouldn't
such ostentatious but empty banquets

468
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,340
go against

469
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,220
His Majesty's

470
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,140
well-meaning intentions?

471
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,888
You overstate it.

472
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,266
Lingnan is surrounded
by mountains and rivers.

473
00:27:09,288 --> 00:27:12,180
We have lots of fish and crabs.
Seafood is cheaper than rice here.

474
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,860
We only prepared

475
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,980
some Lingnan specialty

476
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,555
home-cooked dishes.

477
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,260
Inspector He is a local magistrate.

478
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,980
Taking good care of you two

479
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,622
will relieve His Majesty's worries.

480
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,060
How could His Majesty blame him?

481
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,060
Inspector He.

482
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,133
Don't blame me.

483
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,020
I'm

484
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,700
impatient.

485
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,666
When I think
of Noble Consort's upcoming birthday,

486
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,500
the first thing I thought

487
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,460
is to do a good job

488
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,911
with the litchi transport.

489
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,460
Of course.

490
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,620
Yes.

491
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,660
Since I'm an inspector,

492
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,220
I must provide good service

493
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,980
to Mr. Li.

494
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,300
Mr. Li.

495
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,500
If you have any requests,

496
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,977
how about you ask them now?

497
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,060
I'll go ahead then.

498
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,660
The 1st day of June is coming.

499
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,844
We must set off
on the 19th day of May!

500
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,700
Please gather all the officials

501
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,288
to make arrangements in advance.

502
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:21,700
Inspector He.

503
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,866
What do you think?

504
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,340
Yes.

505
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,488
Time waits for no one.

506
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,580
Listen carefully. From today onward,

507
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,420
all of Lingnan's officials

508
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,666
shall obey Mr. Li's orders.

509
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,620
- Yes.
- Yes.

510
00:28:49,777 --> 00:28:50,822
Speaking of,

511
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:55,711
Amita is the Hu merchant representative
appointed by Right Chancellor.

512
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,980
I wonder what Amita's plan

513
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,933
is for this trip.

514
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,460
Inspector Yu.

515
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,100
Amita is my goddaughter.

516
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,844
She has always been working for me.

517
00:29:08,088 --> 00:29:09,733
I lived in Lingnan for a long time.

518
00:29:09,866 --> 00:29:12,600
Every year, besides paying enough taxes

519
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,755
to the court on time,

520
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:16,750
I always ask myself

521
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,755
if I can do more.

522
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,780
I'm afraid of failing His Majesty

523
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,666
and Right Chancellor's trust in Lingnan.

524
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,820
That's why

525
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,977
I asked Amita to take on this job.

526
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,900
It's also to make us

527
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,380
work harder

528
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,540
and give full support

529
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,060
to the litchi transport.

530
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,533
Yes, Godfather always said

531
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,730
he wants to fund the transport

532
00:29:41,733 --> 00:29:43,600
in the name of Hu Merchants' Association

533
00:29:43,733 --> 00:29:45,377
to relieve His Majesty's worries

534
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,888
and bring joy to Noble Consort.

535
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,300
I must ask

536
00:29:53,733 --> 00:29:56,180
whether the money
funded by Hu Merchants' Association

537
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,780
is an investment

538
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,340
or a gift?

539
00:30:05,266 --> 00:30:06,900
Hu Merchants' Association has flourished

540
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,620
in Tang under His Majesty's generosity.

541
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,933
This money is of course a gift.

542
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,940
Good.

543
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,380
I

544
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,340
didn't expect Hu Merchants' Association

545
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,244
to be so generous.

546
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,000
You contributed both money and manpower

547
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,420
to the litchi transport.

548
00:30:31,977 --> 00:30:35,133
I have nothing to worry about anymore.

549
00:30:41,311 --> 00:30:42,800
Inspector He, please forgive us.

550
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,020
The two envoys have traveled for days

551
00:30:45,088 --> 00:30:46,244
and are a little tired.

552
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,500
How about you talk another day?

553
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,060
Inspector Yu.

554
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,577
Are you really not eating this meal?

555
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:56,900
No need.

556
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:58,355
Alright.

557
00:31:00,755 --> 00:31:01,800
Speaking of,

558
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,580
I have a vacant courtyard.

559
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,980
Why don't you stay there

560
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,688
and rest early?

561
00:31:07,688 --> 00:31:11,088
I have my own arrangements.

562
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,340
Mr. Li, why don't you

563
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,444
stay there?

564
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,955
I'll go back to the inn.

565
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,510
I'm familiar with the inn.

566
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:22,660
Godfather.

567
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:25,733
Right Chancellor
sent me to assist Mr. Li.

568
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,088
I need to do everything myself.

569
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,420
I'll stay at the inn

570
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,466
with Mr. Li.

571
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:34,377
Alright.

572
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,000
Inspector Yu.

573
00:31:43,866 --> 00:31:44,911
Inspector He.

574
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,100
Farewell.

575
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,220
Farewell.

576
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,260
Yu Cheng'en

577
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,777
is truly a Softshell Turtle On Top.

578
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,740
Look at how good he is at pretending.

579
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,780
He presents himself as righteous

580
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,540
and incorruptible.

581
00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:04,288
Should Inspector's Office

582
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,820
send anyone in the next few days,

583
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,100
don't accept anything,

584
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,222
no matter what it is.

585
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:11,600
I understand.

586
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:13,244
We don't care about petty gains.

587
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,888
We'll wait for the big fish to bite.

588
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:18,980
This time,

589
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,177
I won't fish.

590
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:25,622
I'm going to eat him alive.

591
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,660
And Li Shande

592
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,800
even pulled rank on me.

593
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,380
Amita

594
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,511
keeps setting traps for me
to spend money.

595
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,740
Lingnan is my territory.

596
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,955
Are they trying to rebel?

597
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,740
Zhao, remember this.

598
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,100
Since they're shameless,

599
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,888
they can transport their litchis,

600
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:58,422
while I remain as inspector.

601
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:00,577
We'll stay out of each other's way.

602
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,700
I saw him

603
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,180
being very respectful to you today.

604
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,500
Why do you want him?

605
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,888
It's in the past.

606
00:33:10,933 --> 00:33:12,020
Let's not talk about it.

607
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,100
Amita and Li Shande

608
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,955
won't cause any real trouble,

609
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,755
but we can't underestimate Attendant Yu.

610
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,660
Today's act of integrity

611
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,533
must have been for Li Shande.

612
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:32,700
Didn't you hear
Amita deliberately mention

613
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,422
the association will fund them?

614
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,860
It's to remind Attendant Yu

615
00:33:36,911 --> 00:33:39,777
that the association is wealthy.

616
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,780
Eunuchs are petty.

617
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,380
If we

618
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,644
can't satisfy this turtle,

619
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,700
he'll keep this debt in mind

620
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,700
and make something up

621
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,000
in front of Right Chancellor.

622
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,022
We'll lose more than we gain.

623
00:33:56,644 --> 00:33:58,733
But he is Gaozhou's inspector after all.

624
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,700
He has worked

625
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,600
for Right Chancellor over the years.

626
00:34:01,822 --> 00:34:03,333
If you really eat him,

627
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,377
how are you
going to explain to Right Chancellor?

628
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:07,940
He has been

629
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,822
a local tyrant in Lingnan for years.

630
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,740
Won't it be easy

631
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:13,711
to find some evidence?

632
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,220
How annoying.

633
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,460
I really want to throw them

634
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,622
into the river to feed the fish.

635
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,555
Where are they staying?

636
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,911
A courtyard in the west of the city.

637
00:34:27,222 --> 00:34:29,000
It's better than what we prepared

638
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:30,511
for him.

639
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,800
Looks like they have a big appetite.

640
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:37,900
Zhao.

641
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,740
Remember this.

642
00:34:40,377 --> 00:34:42,180
We mustn't let them think

643
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,066
Lingnan is a juicy piece of meat.

644
00:34:44,888 --> 00:34:47,400
How are we
going to live our lives from now on?

645
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,355
How can I cry poor to Right Chancellor?

646
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,220
Our good days

647
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,420
are over.

648
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,100
Today, I noticed

649
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,866
some tension
between Amita and He Youguang.

650
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,340
Find out

651
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,860
what happened

652
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,311
between these two.

653
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:17,500
(Lower A Hall)

654
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,644
Mr. Li is back.

655
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,300
Shande.

656
00:35:26,977 --> 00:35:27,580
You're back.

657
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,580
You're back!

658
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:28,980
I'm back.

659
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,460
How is Xiu'er?

660
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:31,820
Has Xiu'er grown taller?

661
00:35:32,244 --> 00:35:33,500
Has Xiu'er gained weight?

662
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,666
Does she miss me?

663
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,733
You asked so many questions in one go.

664
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,911
She's grown taller and misses you too.

665
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,100
This time, the litchis can make it

666
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,022
to Noble Consort's birthday banquet
on time.

667
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,022
Xiu'er won't have to become an orphan.

668
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,380
I also heard

669
00:35:50,822 --> 00:35:52,844
you received
Right Chancellor's silver token.

670
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:55,244
Here it is.

671
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,088
I tie it to my body even when I sleep.

672
00:35:58,911 --> 00:36:00,200
I'm telling you.

673
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,580
What I least expected

674
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,580
on my return to Chang'an

675
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,533
was to meet Right Chancellor
so smoothly.

676
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,580
Everyone

677
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,066
called Right Chancellor domineering,

678
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,220
but he's currently the only one

679
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,100
who can suppress He Youguang

680
00:36:13,822 --> 00:36:16,044
and make the litchis
be transported smoothly.

681
00:36:17,066 --> 00:36:19,533
I heard you asked Right Chancellor
for someone.

682
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,180
Attendant Yu?

683
00:36:22,022 --> 00:36:23,266
I recommended him.

684
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,860
Well, if more people help me,

685
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,377
I will be closer to success.

686
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:27,820
Right?

687
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,488
When you're closer to success,

688
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,777
I'm not far from death!

689
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,460
I stayed in Lingnan

690
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,060
for so long as Right Chancellor's envoy,

691
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,155
walking on thin ice
and being extremely careful.

692
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,644
I managed to survive until now.

693
00:36:40,711 --> 00:36:43,422
I met Zhao Xinmin
at Konglang Guild a while ago.

694
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,660
He almost found out

695
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,300
my identity.

696
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,580
I was glad that no one identified me.

697
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,444
But look at you.

698
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,488
You do it in one go.

699
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,533
You brought
Right Chancellor's men from Chang'an

700
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,780
to Lingnan to identify me.

701
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,220
No.

702
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,500
That didn't cross my mind.

703
00:36:55,622 --> 00:36:58,422
I've been busy with the litchi transport
since returning to Chang'an.

704
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,400
I was so anxious

705
00:36:59,444 --> 00:37:00,619
that it didn't cross my mind.

706
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,555
It didn't cross it.

707
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:03,866
It didn't cross your mind my foot!

708
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,260
Since returning to Chang'an,

709
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,400
you can't tell right from wrong!

710
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,977
You know who is Attendant Yu?

711
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,500
He is Right Chancellor's lackey!

712
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:11,820
Are you also his lackey?

713
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,860
I'm not a lackey.

714
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,780
What can I do?

715
00:37:13,911 --> 00:37:15,288
I took on a doomed task

716
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,840
and returned to Chang'an to sort it out.

717
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,749
No one would help me,

718
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,170
so I could only find Right Chancellor.

719
00:37:19,177 --> 00:37:19,977
He's very useful.

720
00:37:20,022 --> 00:37:21,444
I'm telling you, Li Shande.

721
00:37:21,644 --> 00:37:23,711
Anyone who has anything to do
with Right Chancellor

722
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,133
will die.

723
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:26,688
I want to overthrow Right Chancellor!

724
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,820
Enough about this.

725
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,555
Stop arguing. We...

726
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,555
I brought you hubing.

727
00:37:30,555 --> 00:37:31,244
Here.

728
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,980
Stop arguing. I...

729
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:35,580
Is a hubing enough to get rid of me?

730
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,133
No, it didn't cross my mind.

731
00:37:38,244 --> 00:37:39,644
You need to give me a bag!

732
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:43,000
I want to overthrow Right Chancellor.
Remember this.

733
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,100
(Order of Tang's Duke of Wei)

734
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,444
Look.

735
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,260
I thought your trip to Chang'an

736
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,820
would be full of hardships,

737
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,980
but you returned

738
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,340
with glory.

739
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,340
You only saw the gains,

740
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,844
but not the pain behind them.

741
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,020
Mr. Su.

742
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,777
Why are you in the litchi garden?

743
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,740
I heard you return.

744
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,755
I went to the inn to wait for you
early in the morning.

745
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,860
Who knew you were gone.

746
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,400
I had no choice but to wait here.

747
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,780
I've been busy

748
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,777
since coming back yesterday.

749
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,140
Aren't we setting off
on the 19th day of May?

750
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,622
There's little time and a lot to do.

751
00:38:39,644 --> 00:38:41,660
I just talked to more than 20 officials

752
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,577
about matters
regarding personnel deployment.

753
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,340
Tong.

754
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:45,740
Later,

755
00:38:45,777 --> 00:38:47,511
they may send someone to help.

756
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,780
When they come,

757
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,740
you need to explain to them

758
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,444
the details

759
00:38:51,444 --> 00:38:53,555
of how to split the branches,
how to protect fruits,

760
00:38:53,555 --> 00:38:55,480
how to harvest bamboo,
and pack them in jars.

761
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,577
Why would those officials listen to me?

762
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,340
From now on, your litchi garden

763
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,711
is officially
the imperial litchi garden.

764
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,460
You work for His Majesty.

765
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,622
Who won't listen to you?

766
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,860
Mr. Su, didn't I tell you

767
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,311
that the dog won't forget?

768
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,860
Are you calling me a dog?

769
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,860
Don't you always say

770
00:39:15,088 --> 00:39:16,380
a dog won't forget its master

771
00:39:16,711 --> 00:39:18,422
even after it becomes successful?

772
00:39:18,555 --> 00:39:20,644
Should I become successful,
I won't forget you.

773
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,580
Won't forget.

774
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,340
But Mr. Li, you still forgot

775
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,755
my reminder.

776
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,100
I heard you let Amita

777
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,000
become the representative
of Hu merchants.

778
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,022
Here's the thing.

779
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,780
Amita and He Youguang

780
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,780
had that incident,

781
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,700
so I asked Right Chancellor

782
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,200
for this position

783
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,422
to protect her.

784
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,780
But Amita

785
00:39:49,911 --> 00:39:51,755
also asked me to tell you.

786
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,666
She said
it's nothing but an empty title.

787
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,533
It's just an empty title.

788
00:39:56,822 --> 00:39:58,044
She put it in the way

789
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,660
they say it now in Chang'an.

790
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,140
She's not in charge

791
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,620
of the specific operation

792
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,955
of the litchi business.

793
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,580
You're still in charge

794
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,844
of this.

795
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,300
Amita

796
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,066
has never shared your hardships,

797
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,022
but now you're sharing glory with her.

798
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:21,333
Your kindness is beyond measure.

799
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,580
I'm speechless

800
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:24,940
and ashamed.

801
00:40:27,622 --> 00:40:30,100
Since you came to Lingnan,

802
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,900
I've been dependent on you.

803
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,577
I hope that one day

804
00:40:34,622 --> 00:40:36,060
we can soar side by side,

805
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,340
shoulder to shoulder,

806
00:40:37,555 --> 00:40:40,500
delivering fresh litchis
to Chang'an together.

807
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,500
Mr. Su.

808
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,020
This time,

809
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,180
I came back

810
00:40:46,888 --> 00:40:48,819
with Attendant Yu from the inner court.

811
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,444
Attendant Yu?

812
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,888
Yes, you should now call him
Inspector Yu.

813
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,500
Inspector Yu?

814
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,340
Yes, he was in charge

815
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,340
of the transportation and procurement
of items

816
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,700
in Chang'an.

817
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,733
He's very experienced,

818
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,300
so you can discuss

819
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,955
any specific ideas with him.

820
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:02,900
Sure.

821
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,140
But...

822
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,577
But I still have some lingering fears.

823
00:41:11,133 --> 00:41:13,244
Be prepared for rain,
even on sunny days.

824
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,420
I manage

825
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,580
all the business

826
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,733
along the litchi transport route.

827
00:41:18,755 --> 00:41:21,955
Does Inspector Yu know this?

828
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,644
Yes.

829
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,066
I told him clearly on our trip here.

830
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,500
He also praised you,

831
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,333
calling you a leader in the industry

832
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,888
and a friend of Tang.

833
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,420
Looks like

834
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,800
Inspector Yu is also a good dog.

835
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,540
I hope we're all good dogs!

836
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:44,850
Good dogs.

837
00:41:44,911 --> 00:41:46,900
Speaking of, Mr. Li,
you said you would bring us

838
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,866
Chang'an's fine wine.
Where's the fine wine?

839
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,711
I didn't forget. I really didn't forget.

840
00:41:51,777 --> 00:41:54,711
But I was busy day and night
when I was in Chang'an.

841
00:41:55,044 --> 00:41:56,311
Besides, it's a long journey.

842
00:41:56,355 --> 00:41:57,459
I'm afraid it might go bad.

843
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,940
You only had one job,

844
00:41:58,980 --> 00:41:59,900
and you forgot.

845
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,333
You're more forgetful than Banque.

846
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:03,900
But...

847
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,700
But I prepared grape wine at the inn

848
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,333
for everyone.

849
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,140
I'll get it later.

850
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,622
Call Li too.

851
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:13,555
We'll drink like there's no tomorrow.

852
00:42:14,377 --> 00:42:15,639
Drink like there's no tomorrow.

853
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,933
This is another Chang'an saying.

854
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,311
I really prepared grape wine.

855
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,911
What happened to Li?

856
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,660
=The Litchi Road=

857
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,140
Hurry.

858
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:37,580
Qilang.

859
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,400
Are we running away?

860
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,619
What are we running away from?

861
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,580
I'm not afraid of anyone.

862
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,555
Even if Inspector's Office
comes knocking,

863
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,511
I'm not scared.

864
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,020
I don't know if we're shipping

865
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,620
litchis or trouble

866
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,060
to Chang'an.

867
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,340
You're not good dogs
who know how to repay kindness.

868
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,580
Now I understand the saying,

869
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,377
"kill the donkey
once the grinding is done".

870
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,844
I'm that donkey!

871
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:07,622
I'm the stupid donkey that you kill.
