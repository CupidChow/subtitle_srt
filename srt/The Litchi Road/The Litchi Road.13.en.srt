4
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,420
What's Li Shande

5
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,060
been up to these past few days?

6
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,260
Today,

7
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,260
he was messing with something

8
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,220
in the litchi garden.

9
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,580
What kind of thing?

10
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,580
I couldn't make sense of it.

11
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,700
Try to show me.

12
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,700
Flat.

13
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,580
Straight.

14
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,700
Sight.

15
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,060
Round.

16
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,460
What is that?

17
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,980
A rattle drum?

18
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,260
This.

19
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,340
He was using this.

20
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,980
This one?

21
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,820
How does it work?

22
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,380
What even is this?

23
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,620
Some kind of sorcery?

24
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,580
Did he say anything else?

25
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,380
Mountains. Tall.

26
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,940
Far.

27
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,100
Mountains tall and rivers far?

28
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,420
Round. Square.

29
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,180
Heaven is round, and Earth is square?

30
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,100
You're killing me here.

31
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,170
Useless idiot!

32
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,570
Go back and keep a close eye on him.

33
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,419
- Report anything strange immediately.
- Yes.

34
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,050
- You'll be the death of me.
- Yes.

35
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,300
Useless thing.

36
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,620
Too warm?

37
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,180
Better?

38
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,540
Too hot?

39
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,140
I'll fan you.

40
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,700
Li.

41
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,700
What were you doing out this late?

42
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,780
You...

43
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,260
Did you go up the mountain to stargaze?

44
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,300
Poor thing.

45
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,900
You can't even sleep at night.

46
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,060
You must really miss home.

47
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,940
Don't worry.

48
00:06:23,977 --> 00:06:25,990
As long as Li Shande doesn't try
to take you away,

49
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,420
I'll never abandon you.

50
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,580
The litchi garden is your home too.

51
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,580
Get some rest.

52
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,130
You've got to help him tomorrow

53
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,620
with whatever he's up to.

54
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,380
You should sleep too.

55
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,220
Inspector He,

56
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,100
Li Shande is using some kind of sorcery

57
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,820
to bewitch the Dong people.

58
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,260
The slave says

59
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,020
he's living very comfortably

60
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,900
over there.

61
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,220
Seems like

62
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,900
this whole transport experiment

63
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,100
might be a cover.

64
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,420
Good. Leave him be.

65
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,900
Zhao.

66
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,420
You have

67
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,620
no idea

68
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,940
how miserable I've been.

69
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,140
Every year when spring turns to summer,

70
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,020
especially when it rains,

71
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,140
my behind gets ridiculously itchy.

72
00:07:44,977 --> 00:07:46,060
If I ever catch the culprit

73
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,460
who shot me back there...

74
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,620
I'll skin him alive.

75
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:52,330
I've ordered the servants

76
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,930
to prepare medicine mashed up

77
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:54,940
with aloe juice.

78
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,220
Once it's properly mixed,

79
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,980
you may apply it to your rear.

80
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,020
Hold up.

81
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,220
Are you saying

82
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,730
all the servants are aware

83
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,580
of my problem?

84
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,660
My lips are sealed.

85
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,060
Right.

86
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,490
Although, Inspector He,
you were a legend at sea.

87
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,060
You were fearless against entire fleets.

88
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,500
How'd someone manage to shoot you there?

89
00:08:20,177 --> 00:08:21,460
Oh, here comes the itch again.

90
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,140
Back then,

91
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,740
I was a one-man army,

92
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,020
taking on ten at a time

93
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,020
without breaking a sweat.

94
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,020
I was armored

95
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,340
head to toe.

96
00:08:33,577 --> 00:08:35,622
The only part left covered
was my backside.

97
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,780
As they say,

98
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,755
you can guard against a gentleman,
not a sneak.

99
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,900
They brought in an archer.

100
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,020
He did nothing

101
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,500
but aim for my behind.

102
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,050
Good thing

103
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,580
I hadn't eaten much that day.

104
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,580
Would've been

105
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:51,980
very embarrassing otherwise.

106
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,060
Don't just stand there!

107
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,620
Go get that aloe juice!

108
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,860
Now!

109
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,100
Amita mentioned

110
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,444
(Inspector's Office)
that you've mapped out four routes

111
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,820
for a trial run

112
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,340
and require 100 fine horses.

113
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,970
You know

114
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,311
this is the Inspector's Office,

115
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:15,300
not a horse farm.

116
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,180
Even if I wanted to help,

117
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,180
I don't have the means.

118
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,820
It's fine. I've handled it.

119
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,290
- You handled it?
- Yes.

120
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,340
I came up with an alternative.

121
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,420
I'm going to do a perimeter run
around the city.

122
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,890
If we relay the horses in shifts,

123
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,180
we won't need nearly as many.

124
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,020
I'm here today

125
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,500
for permission to ask
to use the Small East Gate.

126
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:45,288
Running in circles around the city?

127
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,460
That certainly sounds like sloppy work.

128
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,860
His Majesty asked you
to deliver litchis to Chang'an,

129
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:52,740
and you're just trotting around Lingnan?

130
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,810
What good could come of that?

131
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,380
Terribly unserious of you.

132
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,980
No. It's actually a simulation

133
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,180
of the terrain on the Mei Pass route.

134
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,770
I mapped out

135
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,060
a mix of mountain and flat terrain
in Lingnan.

136
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,740
One lap around the city is about 15 km.

137
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,020
Exactly the distance between

138
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,940
two post stations.

139
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,140
The Small East Gate

140
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,140
will be our relay point.

141
00:10:15,377 --> 00:10:16,690
Once the litchis start to spoil,

142
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,300
we'll tally the laps.

143
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,700
Then, we'll know precisely

144
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,770
how far

145
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:22,660
they can travel

146
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,260
before going bad.

147
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,940
Right?

148
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,060
I'm sure

149
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,820
there'll be crowds gathering to watch.

150
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,420
We'll need someone

151
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,090
to maintain order, so I'd appreciate it

152
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,260
if you could send a few men.

153
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,170
Mr. Li.

154
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,700
You've thought this through.

155
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,300
All right.

156
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,300
Don't worry about that part.

157
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,300
I'll take care of it.

158
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,140
Mr. Li.

159
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,140
Please.

160
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,300
The horse problem's solved.

161
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:57,977
But I still don't have the riders.

162
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,340
I'd appreciate your help

163
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,060
finding some.

164
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,900
You've got a lot of requests.

165
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,970
It's not that.

166
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,260
I'm just doing my job.

167
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,780
Listen.

168
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,780
Here in Lingnan,

169
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,620
you want someone good

170
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,822
at steering boats?

171
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,900
They're everywhere.

172
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,940
Finding a skilled rider? That's tough.

173
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,220
What's the phrase again?

174
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,860
I'd love to help, but I can't.

175
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,860
I understand.

176
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,300
I do.

177
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,140
There is something

178
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:39,511
that was brought to my attention,
Inspector He.

179
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,180
A few days ago,

180
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,980
something came up

181
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,140
and I hired a porter.

182
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,970
He knows I have connections

183
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,060
with you,

184
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:50,911
so he told me about a case of injustice

185
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,620
from ten years ago.

186
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,100
He said his relative

187
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,300
used to be an elite soldier

188
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,490
highly skilled in both horsemanship

189
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,340
and navigation.

190
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:01,930
During a fight with pirates,

191
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,500
he was badly wounded

192
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,900
and went overboard.

193
00:12:06,244 --> 00:12:07,220
He didn't die, though.

194
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,290
When he finally made it back to Lingnan,

195
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,610
he and his unit

196
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,577
were all labeled deserters.

197
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,340
His relative believes

198
00:12:15,555 --> 00:12:16,620
you are a good official

199
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,460
who cares about the people.

200
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,100
So, he asked

201
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,340
if you might help

202
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,980
clear their names.

203
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,820
If we can right that wrong,

204
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,020
then I'll have my team of riders.

205
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,780
Mr. Li.

206
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,940
That's outrageous.

207
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,740
This is hardly reasonable.

208
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,180
You can't possibly

209
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,540
recruit deserters

210
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,380
as your riders.

211
00:12:40,444 --> 00:12:42,750
What does that say about Lingnan?
That we've got no one else?

212
00:12:42,777 --> 00:12:43,780
That's what you said.

213
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,820
I said...

214
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,580
I said it's hard
to find riders in Lingnan.

215
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,660
I see.

216
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,700
And another thing.

217
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,420
Are you seriously just going

218
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,170
to take a porter's word

219
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,020
for all this?

220
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,020
What if that soldier

221
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,610
really did desert

222
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,010
because he couldn't take it at sea?

223
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,500
Well, not exactly.

224
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,460
He gave me details, you see.

225
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,660
The porter said during the fight,

226
00:13:08,044 --> 00:13:09,555
the pirate captain panicked

227
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,000
and jumped overboard.

228
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:13,666
Took an arrow to the backside, even.

229
00:13:14,222 --> 00:13:15,450
These are details...

230
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,300
Enough.

231
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,140
Here's what we'll do.

232
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,300
I'll approve your use

233
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:24,780
of the Small East Gate.

234
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,780
As for the deserters, Chief Scribe Zhao,

235
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,570
- look into it.
- Yes, Sir.

236
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,090
I'll let you know if anything comes up.

237
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,533
All right. I'll leave it to you.

238
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,020
Please excuse me.

239
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,460
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

240
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,220
Inspector He.

241
00:13:49,022 --> 00:13:50,060
The medicine is ready.

242
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,140
Explain yourself.

243
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,460
Why didn't the slave report

244
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,900
what he just said earlier?

245
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,500
Why did you even

246
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,340
send him there?

247
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,020
I've got it.

248
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,450
That slave has definitely been bewitched

249
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,300
by Li Shande.

250
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,460
Bewitched, my foot!

251
00:14:11,466 --> 00:14:12,740
Can you not see what's going on?

252
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,422
This is obviously Li Shande catching on

253
00:14:14,444 --> 00:14:15,610
that we took his horses,

254
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,970
so now he's dredging up old stories

255
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:17,980
to mess with me!

256
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,620
Tell me.

257
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,780
How do I get back at him?

258
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,100
Well,

259
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,850
that's easy.

260
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,260
Li Shande's test is bound

261
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,820
to attract attention.

262
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,570
When the time comes,

263
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,140
we can use it to publicly embarrass him.

264
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,540
I remember

265
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,130
Lan from the cockfighting arena

266
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:38,100
used to be one
of the finest horse trainers.

267
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,460
If he becomes

268
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,750
one of Li Shande's riders,

269
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,900
he could easily

270
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,260
sabotage the test.

271
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,740
Stay out of Lan's business.

272
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,244
I've got my own plans for that.

273
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,540
Come here.

274
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,660
Just one thing.

275
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,140
If this ever comes up...

276
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,780
I mean, if,

277
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,420
one day Amita asks about it,

278
00:15:03,688 --> 00:15:05,266
what are you going to say?

279
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,540
My lips are sealed.

280
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,260
I do recall something

281
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,220
about that dagger.

282
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,620
Sir, Konglang looked into it.

283
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,570
The story goes that

284
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,250
when Haihu and his captains

285
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,222
swore their blood oath,

286
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,844
they used daggers as their tokens.

287
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,900
Each man had one.

288
00:15:27,022 --> 00:15:28,980
Haihu's was gold,
and the others had silver ones.

289
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,530
Each dagger was inlaid

290
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,740
with a different gemstone.

291
00:15:32,622 --> 00:15:34,220
As for the one Mr. Zheng just described

292
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,060
with a ruby,

293
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,500
we can't say for certain

294
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,460
who it belonged to.

295
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,340
Haihu was a chivalrous pirate.

296
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,250
He strictly forbade his men

297
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,580
from stealing medicinal supplies.

298
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,140
But you just said

299
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,740
the pirates looted a ship

300
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,140
that was carrying medicine.

301
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,650
That would mean
whoever owned that dagger

302
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,770
must have acted

303
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:53,620
behind Haihu's back.

304
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:56,679
That was the same year
as the Qijing Pavilion Incident.

305
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,990
There might be more
connecting all of this than we realize.

306
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,220
Nevertheless,
digging up a decade-old case

307
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,570
will take time,

308
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,933
even for the Konglang Guild.

309
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,210
But there are two people

310
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,250
who definitely know

311
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,100
whose dagger that is.

312
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,060
Amita and He Youguang?

313
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,860
Now this is getting interesting.

314
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,420
Ms. Amita.

315
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:27,060
There's a meeting this morning
to discuss a new shipping route.

316
00:16:27,155 --> 00:16:29,444
All the major Hu merchants
should be arriving soon.

317
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,970
And this afternoon,
you're expected to meet

318
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,622
with the wealthy merchant from Quzhou.

319
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,770
Got it.

320
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,180
I'll make the preparations.

321
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,460
Guiyun.

322
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,220
What brings you here?

323
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,879
I've fallen behind
on some Merchants' Association matters.

324
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,688
If there's nothing else,
please take your leave.

325
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,820
This matter concerns your father.

326
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,100
Then speak.

327
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,400
I'll get straight to the point.

328
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:11,088
That Litchi Envoy came to see me.

329
00:17:11,711 --> 00:17:13,450
He said he heard
about a case of injustice

330
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,500
from a porter.

331
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,000
Ten years ago, one of Haihu's men

332
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,660
attacked a merchant ship

333
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,820
carrying medicinal herbs.

334
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:23,911
(Ledger)
A soldier happened to witness it.

335
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,140
The same soldier

336
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,980
intercepted a silver dagger
belonging to a pirate captain.

337
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,780
It bore a ruyi pattern

338
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,980
and was inlaid with a ruby.

339
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,820
This item was no ordinary piece.

340
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,140
The pirates colluded with officials

341
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,820
and had that soldier branded a deserter.

342
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,940
Li Shande went to Inspector He
to appeal for justice.

343
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,500
Inspector He ignored him,

344
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,860
so he turned to me.

345
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,060
I brushed him off too.

346
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:53,400
But yesterday,
while drinking at Qifeng Pavilion,

347
00:17:53,466 --> 00:17:55,355
I overheard others talking about it.

348
00:17:55,422 --> 00:17:57,460
They were saying Haihu
did rob a medical shipment.

349
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,733
That he was no heroic pirate after all.

350
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,170
If this becomes the sort of gossip

351
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,460
casually exchanged in Lingnan,

352
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,980
it would tarnish

353
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,088
your father's reputation.

354
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,380
Sounds like

355
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,180
complete fiction to me.

356
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:21,540
No one would give it any credence.

357
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,260
You should know

358
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,580
rumors end with the wise.

359
00:18:25,977 --> 00:18:27,511
There's no need to justify nonsense.

360
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,100
Of course.

361
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,580
You are magnanimous indeed.

362
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,940
Let the rumors drift away

363
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,100
like dust on the wind.

364
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,111
I shall trouble you no further.

365
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,140
I bid you farewell.

366
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,420
Guiyun.

367
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,820
Are you certain
it happened ten years ago?

368
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,580
Yes.

369
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,460
Li.

370
00:19:05,222 --> 00:19:06,533
Feed the horses regularly

371
00:19:06,555 --> 00:19:08,533
and in measured amounts
over the next few days.

372
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,020
Small portions, but often.

373
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,300
It'll help with digestion.

374
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,940
When the test gets close,

375
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:16,060
add sugar to their water.

376
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,140
It'll boost their stamina.

377
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,300
Mr. Li!

378
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,170
Mr. Li.

379
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,140
Slowly! Careful!

380
00:19:24,177 --> 00:19:25,911
Do you think we've got enough hay?

381
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,060
Is this all of them?

382
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,140
We'll need at least three more carts.

383
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,970
Once the test starts,

384
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,488
we won't have time to restock.

385
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,260
Mr. Li.

386
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,820
Mr. Li.

387
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,100
The roads need to be cleared too.

388
00:19:42,155 --> 00:19:44,444
There are some areas
where the horses can't get through.

389
00:19:44,488 --> 00:19:46,290
Some of the tree branches are too thick.

390
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,879
I'll bring a couple extra hands tomorrow

391
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,860
and clear them myself.

392
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,977
I marked the exact locations
on the map for you.

393
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,940
Have some water.

394
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,580
You don't need to clear everything.

395
00:19:54,622 --> 00:19:57,730
The route from Lingnan to Chang'an
is much more rugged and fraught with risks.

396
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,580
Right?

397
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:00,420
Some obstacles will be good
for the test.

398
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:03,022
But I'll take a look at that map anyway.

399
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,700
Getting water?

400
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,060
There's a well over there.

401
00:20:08,244 --> 00:20:10,490
No need to go outside.
It's quicker to draw from the inside.

402
00:20:10,555 --> 00:20:12,900
- All right.
- Just draw water from the wells inside.

403
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,060
Got it.

404
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,820
Tong.

405
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,100
Once the test starts,

406
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,420
people will gather
at the Small East Gate.

407
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:24,133
We'll need people to take turns

408
00:20:24,155 --> 00:20:25,311
cleaning the horses,

409
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,740
feeding them, relaying messages,

410
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,420
and running errands day and night.

411
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,730
I'll ask Su

412
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,420
for some funds

413
00:20:31,444 --> 00:20:32,460
to compensate everyone.

414
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,740
We're not doing all this

415
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,570
just for your money, you know.

416
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,420
I know.

417
00:20:37,777 --> 00:20:39,555
Either way,
those funds were going to be used

418
00:20:39,622 --> 00:20:40,820
for the post stations.

419
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,210
You're doing their job,

420
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,500
so you deserve that money.

421
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,460
Works out nicely.

422
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,540
Thanks, then.

423
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,580
Don't mention it.

424
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,260
Food's ready!

425
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,770
- I'll clean that later.
- All right.

426
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,050
Come and eat!

427
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,050
Let's eat!

428
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,220
Li! Food's ready!

429
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,860
- Come and eat!
- Come on.

430
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,820
There's enough for everybody!

431
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,850
This is Mr. Li's share.

432
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,300
Give this to Mr. Li.

433
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,822
Come, Mr. Li.

434
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:06,850
- For you, Mr. Li.
- Mr. Li!

435
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,580
You guys eat without me. I'll eat later.

436
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,450
Eat with us.

437
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,466
There's food for everyone.

438
00:21:10,466 --> 00:21:11,577
I'm fine. You guys eat first.

439
00:21:11,577 --> 00:21:12,710
They've already served it up.

440
00:21:12,711 --> 00:21:13,460
Here you go.

441
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,340
Take this.

442
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,620
Eat it.

443
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,860
What's this?

444
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,940
That's spicy wormwood.

445
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,420
This isn't edible.

446
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:31,340
This stuff is poisonous.

447
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,422
Spicy wormwood? It's poisonous.
You can't eat this.

448
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,620
Mr. Li.

449
00:21:34,644 --> 00:21:37,311
We've been eating it here for decades.
Nothing's ever happened.

450
00:21:37,311 --> 00:21:38,377
What do you mean nothing?

451
00:21:38,511 --> 00:21:40,730
Just because nothing's happened yet
doesn't mean it's safe.

452
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,840
It's poisonous.
It just looks like mustard greens.

453
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:43,780
But it is not safe.

454
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,490
Eating it long-term
will harm your health.

455
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,500
- Mr. Li.
- Stop eating it.

456
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,780
We live off the land.

457
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,770
- Dong people are not picky.
- That's right.

458
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:51,780
We eat what we have.

459
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,290
It's better than starving.

460
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,300
That's right.

461
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,100
Tong.

462
00:22:02,177 --> 00:22:03,620
When Su's funding comes through,

463
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,420
use it to buy some proper food.

464
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,620
Rice, flour, and eggs.

465
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,210
Health comes first.

466
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,800
You can't keep living like this forever.

467
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,060
You can stop eating that.

468
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,220
I'll make you something else.

469
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,060
No, I'm fine.

470
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,980
Give whatever's edible to the children.

471
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,700
Don't worry about me.

472
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,940
Feel free to get seconds.

473
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,380
Plenty to go around!

474
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,060
Come back for more!

475
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,820
Mr. Li.

476
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,580
What are you doing here?

477
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,380
I was waiting for you.

478
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,460
Whatever for?

479
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,140
I see I'm not welcome.

480
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,330
But I've waited for you

481
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,180
so long.

482
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,370
Isn't it only right

483
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,500
to invite me in?

484
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,460
I've got plans tonight.

485
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,740
I'll only need a moment.

486
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,140
If you refuse,

487
00:23:00,511 --> 00:23:02,180
you'll be making an enemy out of me.

488
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,533
You've done a good job
taking care of these flowers.

489
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,860
Did you come just to admire them?

490
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,820
Of course not.

491
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,580
Ms. Amita, please enjoy.

492
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,422
I heard you've been going around

493
00:23:33,422 --> 00:23:34,800
helping a deserter clear his name.

494
00:23:34,911 --> 00:23:36,555
That's why I'm here for clarification.

495
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,460
Why are you spreading lies?

496
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,540
I'm not spreading lies.

497
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,500
It really happened.

498
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,620
How can you be sure?

499
00:23:46,266 --> 00:23:47,888
Have you met this deserter yourself?

500
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,580
No, I haven't.

501
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,740
I heard it from a porter.

502
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,330
And just like that,

503
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,888
you take a porter's word as truth?

504
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,940
I choose to believe him.

505
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,620
How can you prove

506
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,540
he's telling the truth?

507
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,420
How can you prove

508
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,340
he's lying?

509
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,740
All right.

510
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,700
Then take me to him.

511
00:24:16,866 --> 00:24:18,100
I want to question him myself.

512
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,970
He's a porter.

513
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,533
Who knows where he's hauling things now?

514
00:24:23,533 --> 00:24:25,230
If he's counting on you
to speak up for him,

515
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,060
surely he would've left you
a way to contact him.

516
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,180
What is it that you want?

517
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,900
I came to clarify a few things.

518
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,090
First, are you sure the pirate robbed

519
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,780
a merchant ship
carrying medicinal herbs?

520
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,850
Second, are you sure the stolen item

521
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,300
was a silver dagger

522
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,500
with a ruyi pattern

523
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,460
and a ruby inlay?

524
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,020
Third, are you sure

525
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,180
this happened ten years ago?

526
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,140
Li Shande.

527
00:24:52,555 --> 00:24:54,020
I'm Inspector He's goddaughter.

528
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,780
I know

529
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,660
you resent me,

530
00:24:58,888 --> 00:25:00,100
but this is no trivial matter.

531
00:25:00,111 --> 00:25:02,666
Targeting a medicinal merchant
implicates my father's reputation.

532
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,180
Let's make a deal.

533
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:13,355
You stop helping this man
clear his name.

534
00:25:13,977 --> 00:25:15,555
I'll push through a pardon for him.

535
00:25:16,488 --> 00:25:17,733
I only have one condition.

536
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,020
Once it's done,

537
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,380
you take me to him.

538
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:24,700
I want to see that dagger
with my own eyes

539
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,540
and confirm who it belonged to.

540
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,820
Deal?

541
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,300
I'll come back

542
00:25:39,555 --> 00:25:40,780
once the pardon is secured.

543
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,140
Su.

544
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,100
Don't get up. Sit.

545
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,380
Su, are you...

546
00:26:15,622 --> 00:26:16,770
Is this a rider recruitment

547
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,180
or a combat arena?

548
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,500
Winner stays, loser goes.

549
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,140
Round-robin competition,

550
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,940
fair and square.

551
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,420
Any riders here

552
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,940
who can handle a thousand-li horse?

553
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:31,780
Lingnan is mountainous,

554
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,466
its people poor, and horses scarce.

555
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,300
We move goods using oxen and mules.

556
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,300
It's hard to find

557
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,300
even a decent rider.

558
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,740
Su, I've basically secured

559
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,700
one rider already.

560
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,340
I just need your help finding one more.

561
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,620
Just one will do.

562
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,860
With those two,

563
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,300
I can kick things off

564
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,620
with the trial.

565
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,820
It won't be easy.

566
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,700
Even one is tough.

567
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,780
Can't you think of another solution?

568
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,540
I'm worried.

569
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,220
After what happened before,

570
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,940
no one dares volunteer now.

571
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,180
Su.

572
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,340
Well, I've got an idea.

573
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,250
Why don't we add a line to the notice?

574
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,100
"For anyone

575
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,260
who can ride a thousand-li horse,

576
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,900
pay is negotiable."

577
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,620
You lost 13 matches!

578
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,690
Are you insane?

579
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,180
- 13 matches!
- Help!

580
00:27:34,688 --> 00:27:36,711
Did you forget what's at stake
when you lose?

581
00:27:36,733 --> 00:27:37,980
Lan, please...

582
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,740
Lan.

583
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,020
Lan.

584
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,820
Just trust me.

585
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,340
I will win the next one.

586
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,780
If you lend me the money,

587
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,300
I swear I'll turn it around.

588
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,140
I may run a cockfighting arena,

589
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,260
but I still have morals.

590
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,900
If I loan you money now,

591
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,660
you'll lose everything.

592
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,620
Keep losing,

593
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,540
and your family will suffer.

594
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,980
They'll be homeless.

595
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,340
Your home will fall apart.

596
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,060
By the time you regret it,
it'll be too late.

597
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,060
You'll spend
the rest of your life ruined.

598
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,060
Can you bear that?

599
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,020
Leave.

600
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,020
Wait.

601
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,740
I knew it.

602
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,900
Lan is just too soft-hearted.

603
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,044
He's been running
the cockfighting arena for years,

604
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,620
and whenever he sees
a gambler spiraling,

605
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,620
he always tries to stop them.

606
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,900
Lan already said it.

607
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,180
We operate a cockfighting arena

608
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,340
and gambling happens.

609
00:29:20,644 --> 00:29:22,180
But gambling itself is dangerous.

610
00:29:23,377 --> 00:29:24,800
There's a limit to everything.

611
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,400
If he sees someone going too far,

612
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,460
he will step in.

613
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,860
Lan doesn't chase fame or fortune.

614
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:32,460
He treats winning and losing
like passing clouds.

615
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,820
Cai.

616
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,260
You've known Lan the longest.

617
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,340
What has he been through?

618
00:29:43,222 --> 00:29:45,100
Don't pry into things
you know little about.

619
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,650
Sir.

620
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,500
This way, please.

621
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,020
Lan!

622
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,100
Chicken Daddy.

623
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,610
Free today

624
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,460
for a match?

625
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,420
No way.

626
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,900
I'm not free today. Come here.

627
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,700
How's that rooster I asked you

628
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,820
to train?

629
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,660
Still needs work.

630
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,980
Just got it to settle its spirit

631
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,060
and shake off its arrogance.

632
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,970
Working on getting it

633
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,100
to act dumb

634
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,820
for the matches.

635
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,500
Why train it

636
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,740
to act dumb?

637
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,540
So the opponent underestimates it.

638
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,800
Calm and quiet.

639
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,460
No matter how strong the foe is,

640
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:33,260
it stays still like a block of wood.

641
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,420
Immensely calm and unfazed.

642
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,260
That's what makes it invincible.

643
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,220
Sounds profound.

644
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,980
I'll leave it in your hands.

645
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,140
I came here today

646
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,620
for another matter.

647
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,377
Could you ride for me this once?

648
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,900
A horse?

649
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,540
Chicken Daddy.

650
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,220
I haven't ridden in years.

651
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,940
My skills have grown quite rusty.

652
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,050
Well, for this task,
no exceptional horsemanship is required.

653
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,340
In fact, I want the opposite.

654
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,970
You know

655
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,340
we recently got

656
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,180
that Litchi Envoy around here.

657
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,380
He insists on recruiting riders

658
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,660
at the Small East Gate

659
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,060
for some kind of test.

660
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,450
I was hoping

661
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,500
you could gather a few decent riders

662
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,980
and show up.

663
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,970
Just pretend to ride full speed,

664
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,460
make it look like you're pushing it,

665
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,540
but actually keep the pace slow,

666
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,900
and drag it out.

667
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,020
All we need is to stall
until those litchis

668
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,970
start changing color.

669
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:32,810
- Chicken Daddy.
- Where's that wine I brought for Lan?

670
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:33,820
Bring it here!

671
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,300
(Dongting Chunse)

672
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,450
I can't accept this wine.

673
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,300
I'm not used to it.

674
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,580
If you want to drink it,

675
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,540
have a sip.

676
00:31:41,755 --> 00:31:42,810
If not, just keep it here.

677
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,300
Considered it stored with you for now.

678
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,700
Lan.

679
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,820
In a couple of days,

680
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,090
I'll even introduce you

681
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:52,439
to a few Hu women
who are excellent singers and dancers.

682
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,500
Guaranteed to your liking.

683
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,860
Hu women break hearts.

684
00:31:58,377 --> 00:31:59,260
I've quit all that too.

685
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,500
Quit?

686
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:09,466
So you're done with wine and women now?

687
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,220
Have you become a monk?

688
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,060
Lan.

689
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,980
I underestimated you.

690
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,060
Well, fair enough.

691
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,820
Wine and women are fleeting pleasures.

692
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,340
Real gold and silver,

693
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:27,733
that's what actually matters.

694
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,060
How about this?

695
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,010
If you agree to help me

696
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,100
and make this happen,

697
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,420
I'll hand over all the rent
and lease profits

698
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,020
from this whole street.

699
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,500
You know how sizable the cut from that

700
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,820
will be.

701
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,980
(Inspector's Office)

702
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,940
Chief Scribe Zhao.

703
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,540
Amita.

704
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,700
Chief Scribe Zhao.

705
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,100
Where's my godfather?

706
00:32:58,488 --> 00:33:00,155
He went to the cockfighting arena.

707
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,900
Why? Is it urgent?

708
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:04,940
No.

709
00:33:05,688 --> 00:33:07,140
Then you'll have to wait a while.

710
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,940
Chief Scribe Zhao.

711
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:13,930
Did that Litchi Envoy come here

712
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,450
the other day to plead a case

713
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,100
for a deserter?

714
00:33:18,044 --> 00:33:19,600
I haven't heard anything like that.

715
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,140
You run this office
like a strategist in a command tent.

716
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,770
Even a fly going the wrong way

717
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:29,020
can't escape your notice.

718
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,740
What don't you know?

719
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,060
You flatter me.

720
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,900
I was out of the city a few days ago,

721
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:37,900
away on business.

722
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,780
Things pile up fast here at the office.

723
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,420
It's hard to keep up.

724
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,090
It's getting late.

725
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,540
I need to deliver some documents.

726
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,260
I'll be off now.

727
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,340
Do be patient.

728
00:33:50,533 --> 00:33:52,177
There's coconut water over there.

729
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,111
Freshly opened.

730
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,140
Inspector He.

731
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,660
Zhao.

732
00:34:01,222 --> 00:34:03,288
Amita's here asking about the deserter.

733
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,420
Amita.

734
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,810
Godfather.

735
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,180
Good to see you. Sit.

736
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,140
Sit.

737
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,620
You should've told me you were coming.

738
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,860
I would've prepared your favorites.

739
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,940
Sasan replied.

740
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,244
The colored glaze goods are ready.

741
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,670
But this isn't the wind season,

742
00:34:22,755 --> 00:34:24,800
so let's wait a little
before shipping them.

743
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,300
That can wait.

744
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,020
The priority right now

745
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,044
is your re-election
as head of the association.

746
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,090
Everything else

747
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:33,540
can come later.

748
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:35,940
Speaking of which,

749
00:34:37,222 --> 00:34:39,644
Su Liang submitted a bid
for the litchi transport trial.

750
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:40,970
He's had his eye on my position

751
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:42,100
for a while now.

752
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,540
If the litchi transport
actually works out,

753
00:34:45,644 --> 00:34:47,533
he could become a real threat to me.

754
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,250
What threat?

755
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,100
He will not succeed.

756
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,820
Trust me.

757
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,180
I do not think

758
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,580
Li Shande will be fazed.

759
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,300
He's stubborn.

760
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,010
Even if this trial fails,

761
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,060
he'll try again.

762
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,660
We should be prepared for all outcomes.

763
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,700
I gave him two horses,

764
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,820
just as a gesture

765
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,311
of support.

766
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,660
You just go through
the motions publicly.

767
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,220
That way, even if the litchis

768
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,300
really do reach Chang'an,

769
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,990
you will still get credit
before His Majesty.

770
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,300
And I will retain influence

771
00:35:20,311 --> 00:35:21,620
over the Merchants' Association.

772
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,580
No.

773
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,460
Li Shande isn't someone

774
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,333
you can brush off.

775
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,060
Just a few days ago, he came to me

776
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,140
blabbering about a pardon

777
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,700
for some foot soldier.

778
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,460
If I give in now,

779
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,580
what next?

780
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,570
He will just

781
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,540
keep pushing.

782
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,111
There'll be no end to it.

783
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,580
I've heard about that too.

784
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,170
That Litchi Envoy

785
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,860
is trying to plead

786
00:35:45,933 --> 00:35:46,900
the case of a deserter.

787
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,180
Ma Guiyun came to me as well.

788
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,490
They say ten years ago,

789
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,580
one of my father's men

790
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,540
hijacked a ship
that was transporting medicinal herbs.

791
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,266
It has stirred up quite a storm
throughout the city.

792
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,377
Everyone knows now.

793
00:35:59,511 --> 00:36:00,955
It damages your reputation

794
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,100
and also stains my father's name.

795
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,020
As you said,

796
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,980
I can't afford to lose my position.

797
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,660
And you've just acquired
the military tally.

798
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,140
You've got big plans.

799
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,500
Our best move is to shut this rumor down

800
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,180
as soon as possible.

801
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,780
And how do we

802
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,700
shut it down?

803
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,444
There's something I kept from you.

804
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,100
Before I came here,

805
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,860
I met with Li Shande.

806
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,180
We made a deal.

807
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,220
We'll use your pardon order

808
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,060
to lure the soldier out.

809
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,730
Otherwise,

810
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:42,866
we'll never find him.

811
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,620
So

812
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,500
the two of you have it all worked out?

813
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,660
I only laid out terms with him.

814
00:37:04,977 --> 00:37:07,100
The final decision, of course,
is yours to make.

815
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,100
I'm tired.

816
00:37:16,911 --> 00:37:18,933
I won't keep you for the evening meal.

817
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,820
Go back.

818
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:33,980
Ms. Amita.

819
00:37:34,066 --> 00:37:36,111
Why are you so determined
to help that Litchi Envoy

820
00:37:36,155 --> 00:37:37,288
get that deserter pardoned?

821
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,940
I must confront that soldier in person

822
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,170
and find out who betrayed my father

823
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,940
and seized that ship.

824
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:01,020
(Inspector's Office)

825
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:22,060
(Inspector's Office)

826
00:38:30,288 --> 00:38:32,100
"For anyone
who can ride a thousand-li horse,

827
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,500
pay is negotiable."

828
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,460
How negotiable

829
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,580
are we talking?

830
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,300
You can ride one?

831
00:38:42,422 --> 00:38:43,580
I'm willing to give it a try.

832
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,340
If you can ride a thousand-li horse,

833
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,022
your pay will be 10% higher

834
00:38:51,044 --> 00:38:53,020
than the others.

835
00:38:53,511 --> 00:38:55,622
For every extra day you last,
we'll add another 10%.

836
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,170
Sound fair?

837
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,369
That sounds too complicated.

838
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,420
I don't need the extra pay.

839
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,540
But I will need

840
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,222
half the deposit upfront today.

841
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,780
This guy talks big.

842
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,940
Watch out. He might push your limits

843
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,500
and become greedy.

844
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,888
What are you going on about?

845
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,955
Let me tell you something.

846
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,900
Back in the day,

847
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,740
they called this guy "Shadowless."

848
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,140
Do you know why?

849
00:39:20,311 --> 00:39:21,450
Once he flicked the reins,

850
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,940
you could not even see his shadow.

851
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,380
Are you a professional rider?

852
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,860
I run a cockfighting arena.

853
00:39:31,311 --> 00:39:32,860
So, this is a different field for you.

854
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,740
Why did you stop riding?

855
00:39:41,222 --> 00:39:43,444
I've always felt that horses
have a spirit of their own.

856
00:39:43,488 --> 00:39:45,000
They should run free across the land,

857
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,100
not be tethered by reins.

858
00:39:48,066 --> 00:39:49,819
Now, I've got the urge to ride again.

859
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,420
So, I thought I'd give it a try.

860
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,420
Go for it. Show us what you've got.

861
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,170
If you can handle the horse,

862
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,020
we'll go

863
00:40:00,066 --> 00:40:01,620
with whatever pay structure you want.

864
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,490
Naiyi.

865
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,380
Bring Rixing over.

866
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,580
Yes, Sir.

867
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,860
Be careful.

868
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,660
Good horses are common.

869
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,140
A horse whisperer is rare.

870
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,820
Big guy.

871
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,060
Let me give you a friendly warning.

872
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,420
That horse is wild.

873
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,980
If you insist on going head-to-head

874
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,460
with it and end up bruised,

875
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,620
bloody, and broken,

876
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,260
I won't be covering

877
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,220
any medical bills.

878
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,140
Can't you say something nice, Beardy?

879
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,060
Thank you.

880
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,020
Watch and learn!

881
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,140
Mr. Li, he's off!

882
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,100
Off?

883
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,460
This is great!

884
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,620
This is amazing!

885
00:41:21,755 --> 00:41:23,100
What a blessing out of nowhere!

886
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,940
Feng!

887
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,780
Do you see me, Feng?

888
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,340
They're back.

889
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,780
Incredible!

890
00:42:03,866 --> 00:42:05,866
- Amazing!
- You haven't lost your touch.

891
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,060
Might I ask for your name, Sir?

892
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,940
Humbled by your praise.

893
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,340
They call me Lan of Gaozhou.

894
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,220
Lan.

895
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,330
Mr. Lan.

896
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:16,260
A deserving name.

897
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,530
Mr. Lan, you have saved me

898
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,580
at a desperate hour.

899
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,540
These two friends of mine

900
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,711
are skilled riders as well.

901
00:42:22,711 --> 00:42:24,933
Would you mind letting them try out
your fine horse too?

902
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,130
Of course.

903
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:26,980
The more, the merrier.

904
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,460
We need all the help we can get.

905
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,140
The more, the merrier.

906
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:33,580
=The Litchi Road=

907
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,140
Remember. Sometimes,

908
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:40,300
the truth hurts more than a lie.

909
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,860
Don't act like you know me.

910
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,300
I'd like to.

911
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,300
Tomorrow, I will count on all of you

912
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,180
to give it your best

913
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,300
to fight for a result together with me.

914
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,620
All right!

915
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,460
Move out!

916
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,420
I have never staked this much money

917
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,730
on something

918
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:07,980
