1
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,999
=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,980
(Mask)

3
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,550
You look amazing!

4
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,910
Stay still,

5
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,644
or it's going to take forever.

6
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,070
Don't smile.

7
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,120
With one wrong stroke,

8
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,790
your brow will be ruined.

9
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,570
Go on.

10
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,500
Let me do your makeup.

11
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,920
Look at the guy.

12
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:23,990
Zheng Ping'an?

13
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,550
Zheng Ping'an.

14
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,680
Look at you.

15
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:39,150
You're pale as a ghost.

16
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,840
Clinging to that old title will only

17
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,360
make you starve.

18
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,470
Wear that

19
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,550
and hide your face.

20
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,750
You'll forget who you are.

21
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,520
You pay downstairs.

22
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,520
We're fully booked
and short-staffed today.

23
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,150
Even though it's your first shift,

24
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,240
you'll have to handle

25
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,400
the guests upstairs on your own.

26
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,680
Understood.

27
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,120
Don't worry, Sir.

28
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,310
Those guests upstairs

29
00:03:22,844 --> 00:03:24,630
have been my close friends for years.

30
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,310
Two of them are sworn brothers of mine.

31
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,800
I helped them

32
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,190
get a foothold in Chang'an.

33
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,840
Say what you will.

34
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,760
Back then,

35
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:36,930
you were the one being served.

36
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,060
From now on,

37
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,180
you'll be the one serving.

38
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,420
Well? Get going.

39
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,340
Let's make a bet.

40
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,340
In a bit,

41
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,300
he's definitely putting on airs

42
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,620
to make us all

43
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,420
act grateful and humble.

44
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,900
"Mr. Zheng."

45
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:04,060
"Thanks for your help."

46
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,580
Back then,

47
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,180
he had the Zheng family behind him.

48
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,460
But now in Chang'an,

49
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,660
everyone knows

50
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,420
his father's branch

51
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,800
was kicked out of the family.

52
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,020
He even lost the right

53
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,340
to take the imperial exams.

54
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,380
The last time I ran into him,

55
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,180
he still acted like

56
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,980
some refined, elegant scholar.

57
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,260
Broke scholar.

58
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,300
Broke scholar.

59
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,740
Broke scholar.

60
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,780
He's nothing but a wine server now.

61
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,660
In this tavern,

62
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,860
he's just a beggar boy.

63
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,100
Hear, hear! Hear, hear!

64
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,180
Hey now.

65
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,266
You've waited long.

66
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,420
I...

67
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,900
offer a dance

68
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,700
as an apology.

69
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,220
As an apology.

70
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,140
Zheng,

71
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,340
please.

72
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,940
Very well.

73
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,660
Bravo! Bravo!

74
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,220
All these years, I never noticed

75
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,260
Zheng's so graceful.

76
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,700
He is light on his feet!

77
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,860
Excellent!

78
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,340
Just brilliant!

79
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,580
Who would've thought

80
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,780
Zheng had such talent

81
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,260
for the Sogdian Whirl dance!

82
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,140
- Hear, hear!
- Hear, hear!

83
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,660
- A reward for him!
- Yes!

84
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,940
- Give him a reward!
- Yes!

85
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,420
Spin, spin, spin!

86
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,420
Reward him!

87
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,300
Spin, spin!

88
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,300
Come again next time!

89
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,660
Zheng!

90
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,060
We'll come back for more.

91
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,100
Reward him!

92
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,140
Fantastic.

93
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,420
Where will I go once
I've danced through the falling petals?

94
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,060
With a smile,
I step into the Hu tavern.

95
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,860
=Episode 9=

96
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,100
That letter you seized today
from the Right Chancellor's envoy,

97
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,220
isn't it the same clue

98
00:07:31,888 --> 00:07:33,377
Song Wuji uncovered in Lingnan

99
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,380
during the investigation?

100
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,740
Exactly.

101
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,500
Zheng Ping'an not only
recovered the letter of allegiance,

102
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:42,300
but he also pulled off a surprise win.

103
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,420
I truly underestimated him.

104
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,980
In Lingnan, He Youguang

105
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,622
already held absolute power.

106
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,260
Now he's got the military tally too.

107
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,380
He controls both the government
and the troops. He'll only grow bolder.

108
00:07:54,822 --> 00:07:57,260
People only look out for themselves.
The Right Chancellor

109
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,700
has grown so brazen.

110
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,260
Now, the Noble Consort is gaining favor.

111
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,380
We can't afford to wait.

112
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,700
The more chaos He Youguang causes

113
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,500
with the military tally in hand,

114
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,140
the better our chance of sinking
the Right Chancellor's ship.

115
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,180
That's why I brought up
the Zheng family earlier.

116
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,460
I was trying to provoke Zheng Ping'an.

117
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,420
You want him to stay.

118
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,220
But, I fear he's too timid

119
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,580
to shoulder the task.

120
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,940
I told him
what really happened back then

121
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,100
to make him realize

122
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,900
the noble house he longs to return to

123
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,460
is built on lies.

124
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,060
All these years, he's been
flattering nobles at Chang'an banquets.

125
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,580
No matter how well he dances,

126
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,940
he's going nowhere.

127
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,340
He's no different from us.

128
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,260
Just a pawn to the powerful,

129
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,260
and a nail in their grip.

130
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,860
Now that he's in the game,

131
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,380
we should give him a real chance.

132
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,540
Let him learn that glory
isn't something handed to you.

133
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,540
He has to fight for it himself.

134
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,980
Konglang Guild works in the shadows.

135
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,500
I need someone to help me.

136
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,500
His status as
the Right Chancellor's envoy

137
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,940
is still useful for now.

138
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,420
If Zheng Ping'an still has the heart

139
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,780
and conscience of a son,

140
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,140
he'll stay.

141
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,900
If he chooses to leave,

142
00:09:07,777 --> 00:09:09,311
let him return to Chang'an

143
00:09:09,311 --> 00:09:11,222
and be the Assistant Minister
of Entertainment.

144
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,100
Master Konglang.

145
00:09:15,244 --> 00:09:16,620
Can that letter from He Youguang

146
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,400
pledging loyalty
to the Right Chancellor

147
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,340
take him down?

148
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,340
The Right Chancellor holds great power.

149
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,700
One letter of allegiance

150
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,180
won't shake his position.

151
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,260
The Left Chancellor still hasn't

152
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,900
caught him in a mistake.

153
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,220
Hence, the roundabout plot.

154
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:32,980
Now,

155
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,540
we just need to bring down He Youguang.

156
00:09:35,888 --> 00:09:38,133
Then, use the letter
to expose the Right Chancellor.

157
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,700
Only then can we shake his foundation.

158
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,140
How do we

159
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,220
bring He Youguang down?

160
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,620
That's not your concern.

161
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,620
Master Konglang.

162
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,644
The Right Chancellor killed my father.

163
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,060
Please,

164
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,900
I need guidance.

165
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,020
You barely escaped with your life.

166
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,977
Are you sure you want to
return to the lion's den?

167
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,620
If I don't have my revenge,

168
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,540
I am no man!

169
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,300
The envoy from the Right Chancellor

170
00:10:22,511 --> 00:10:24,340
brought the key
to toppling He Youguang.

171
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,220
Qijing Pavilion.

172
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,940
(Qijing Pavilion)

173
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,500
This is an old story from Lingnan.

174
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,780
It started ten years ago.

175
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:48,660
Back then in Lingnan,

176
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,977
there was a sea merchant, Haihu.

177
00:10:49,977 --> 00:10:51,066
He created the Sea Sail Fund.

178
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,220
People in Lingnan could buy a share,

179
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,020
and that gave them a stake in his fleet.

180
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,780
When his ships returned
from their voyages,

181
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,377
profits were split based on the shares.

182
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,580
Because Haihu was so powerful at sea,

183
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,940
everyone scrambled to buy in.

184
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,860
They were sure

185
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,580
they'd strike it rich.

186
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,820
Even the five top merchants

187
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,020
in the Hu Merchants' Association
poured in a huge sum.

188
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,260
Haihu ran the Sea Sail Fund

189
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,300
from Qijing Pavilion,

190
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,460
where he met with traders.

191
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,820
But one night, a fire broke out

192
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,380
at Qijing Pavilion.

193
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,020
Haihu didn't make it out in time

194
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,940
and died in the flames.

195
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,260
Overnight,

196
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,711
the Sea Sail Fund became worthless.

197
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,940
At that time,

198
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,820
people across Lingnan were weeping.

199
00:11:34,955 --> 00:11:36,020
Everyone was in mourning.

200
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,755
Could you say that again?

201
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,688
I didn't catch a single word.

202
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,820
Long story short,

203
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,860
He Youguang

204
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,020
used to work under Haihu.

205
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:55,060
After the fire at Qijing Pavilion,

206
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,580
Haihu's merchant fleet collapsed.

207
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,380
But He Youguang rose instead.

208
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,500
He joined the authorities

209
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,180
and quickly built his power.

210
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,380
In no time,

211
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,140
he became the Inspector of Lingnan,

212
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,780
a man with absolute control.

213
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,140
Now I get it.

214
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,500
The fire at Qijing Pavilion

215
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,100
benefited He Youguang the most.

216
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,177
So, it wasn't just an accident.

217
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,420
He Youguang planned it.

218
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,900
In Lingnan, Song Wuji

219
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,111
tracked down Qijing Pavilion

220
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:27,500
and raced back to Chang'an.

221
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,980
He must have found something.

222
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,420
Did anyone survive

223
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,460
that fire back then?

224
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,500
Anyone we can ask?

225
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,060
It was a raging fire
in the middle of the night.

226
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,300
No one inside Qijing Pavilion
made it out.

227
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,860
But, if the fire was intentional,

228
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,260
there must be a flaw somewhere.

229
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,980
I work in the shadows.

230
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,460
There are many public occasions

231
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,300
where I can't attend.

232
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,340
But, if the Inspector's Office believes

233
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,800
you are the Right Chancellor's envoy,

234
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,980
then you can use that identity

235
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,000
to move freely outside.

236
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,180
Gather what intel you can.

237
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,180
As you wish.

238
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,660
However,

239
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,140
if you remain in Lingnan,

240
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,511
you'll need a proper reason

241
00:13:03,511 --> 00:13:04,980
for the Inspector's Office to accept.

242
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,180
That way,

243
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,460
they won't interfere.

244
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,060
Thank you for the reminder.

245
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,060
I know how to handle
the Inspector's Office.

246
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,180
I have no talent or skill,

247
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,540
so I offer my life to this cause.

248
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,220
I will give it everything I have.

249
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,940
I misjudged you.

250
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,620
I thought you were just a coward

251
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,300
who chased after wealth and status.

252
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,300
You didn't misjudge me.

253
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,820
I am a coward.

254
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,900
But for my father,

255
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,340
and for my sister,

256
00:13:38,377 --> 00:13:39,420
I'll be brave this once.

257
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,580
Mr. Ma, you're back.

258
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,940
Please wait a moment.

259
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,140
Innkeeper.

260
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,888
You're still up this late?

261
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,220
I was waiting for you.

262
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,780
Waiting for me?

263
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,380
You've been here for quite a while.

264
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,977
We barely get by.

265
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,740
So about your room and meals,

266
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,540
would you mind settling up first?

267
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,660
Here's the ledger.

268
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,900
Feel free to look over the details.

269
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,780
(Lower A Hall)

270
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,060
Alright.

271
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,900
This one too.

272
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,420
Innkeeper,

273
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,466
I'll cover the room I stayed in.

274
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:29,580
As for the other,

275
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,911
the tenants there pay for it.

276
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,580
I already went to see Envoy Li.

277
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,140
He says

278
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,060
you're not the stingy type.

279
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,600
You'd help cover his bill.

280
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,300
Otherwise, people might laugh at him.

281
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,333
And that would embarrass you too.

282
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,380
Don't listen to him.

283
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,620
He doesn't know me.

284
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,420
Envoy Li also says,

285
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,980
if you refuse to help with the bill,

286
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,460
he'll just go crash in your room.

287
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,100
And he says

288
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,860
that the bond between you two

289
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,955
won't survive that.

290
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,060
I...

291
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,620
Qilang,

292
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,820
just help him out, will you?

293
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,380
Otherwise, where am I supposed to stay?

294
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,555
He wouldn't have pinned it on me

295
00:15:16,555 --> 00:15:18,133
if you hadn't vouched for him.

296
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,820
How about you pay me first,

297
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,740
then go settle things with him?

298
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,300
- Alright.
- Here.

299
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,140
I'm not the type

300
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,980
who likes owing anyone.

301
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,540
Here you go.

302
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,780
Alright.

303
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,580
Then, I'll leave you be.

304
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,260
Come on.

305
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,260
Here, Gou'er, take this. Here you go.

306
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,620
(Urn No.4, Urn No.3)

307
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,940
Knock first!

308
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,620
Pay me back.

309
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,940
What money?

310
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,700
Don't play dumb.

311
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,820
Su Liang gave you all that silver,

312
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,580
and you still spent mine?

313
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,780
I'm flat broke now.

314
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,420
You can't be that stingy!

315
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,670
That money Su gave me

316
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,900
was for the litchi transport.

317
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,930
I can't touch that.

318
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,222
You're so careless with money.

319
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,900
Are you flat broke?

320
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,420
Right now, I'm Ma Guiyun.

321
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,340
Not the Assistant Minister.

322
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,500
I have no income at all.

323
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,266
I ran out of money ages ago.

324
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,222
And I have to feed you.

325
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,688
At least give this back to me.

326
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,180
What?

327
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,977
The twenty guan for the house.

328
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,660
No, Ping'an.

329
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,420
You came to Lingnan just to...

330
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,700
return the IOU?

331
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:34,740
You're even holding it?

332
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,580
What is this?

333
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,860
This is...

334
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,140
Don't you remember?

335
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,444
Give it back to me.

336
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,733
I'll pay you back.

337
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,140
But today, I need answers from you.

338
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,180
Ping'an.

339
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,540
Why did you come to Lingnan?

340
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,700
Why are you walking around
with the name

341
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,540
Ma Guiyun?

342
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,140
Who is Ma Guiyun?

343
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,300
We had a drink that day.

344
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,140
You said

345
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,380
you wanted revenge.

346
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,500
That's been weighing on my mind.

347
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,340
I...

348
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,460
What's going on?

349
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,420
Knowing too much won't do you any good.

350
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,980
At least tell me the truth.

351
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,420
If not, I...

352
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,740
I'm just worried.

353
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,100
Ma Guiyun was

354
00:17:21,644 --> 00:17:23,000
Right Chancellor's envoy.

355
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,220
He's dead.

356
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,355
The Left Chancellor told me
to take his name

357
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,333
- and come to Lingnan to investigate...
- You...

358
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,600
Gou'er, give us some space.

359
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,660
Close the door.

360
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,580
You shouldn't be here.

361
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,380
Mr. Li, I know more than you do.

362
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,940
Fine.

363
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,060
I came here

364
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,866
for the loyalty letter He Youguang
wrote to the Right Chancellor.

365
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,540
I already got the letter.

366
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,780
I could've gone back to Chang'an.

367
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,100
But, I heard the Right Chancellor

368
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,622
was involved in my father's death.

369
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,940
I wanted to gather more proof.

370
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,133
I want to bring him down.

371
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,780
You? Take down the Right Chancellor?

372
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,780
You can barely transport litchis.

373
00:18:18,822 --> 00:18:19,700
Did I make fun of you?

374
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,860
The two of us

375
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,933
are doing death missions.

376
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,220
Poor Xiu'er.

377
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,420
The two people she's closest to

378
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:34,220
are dancing on the edge of death.

379
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,540
Ping'an,

380
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,500
we have to stay alive.

381
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,300
We must return to Chang'an.

382
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,620
Close your eyes.

383
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,820
I'll go get your money.

384
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,550
Why bother?

385
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,020
You could just bring it to me.

386
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,020
Alright, go back.

387
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:53,980
I'll bring it over.

388
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,700
Open your eyes.

389
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,340
Ping'an,

390
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,940
let me say one more thing.

391
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,140
Don't worry.

392
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,300
I'll be careful.

393
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,340
But...

394
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,860
Watch your spending.

395
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,780
Courier horse is here!

396
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,580
Hurry, the courier horse is here!

397
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,540
Finally, the courier arrived!

398
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,820
Any letter for me?

399
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,820
Anything for me?

400
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,460
- One for me?
- Anything for me?

401
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,860
- Check it for me.
- Do I have one?

402
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,500
Lingnan Circuit,

403
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,500
Gaozhou Inn.

404
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,140
Litchi Envoy Li Shande.

405
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,760
- Here, that's me.
- Li Shande.

406
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,955
- Li Shande.
- Your letter.

407
00:20:40,977 --> 00:20:41,660
Me, me!

408
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,460
Where's mine?

409
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,020
Li Yunsheng.

410
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:46,980
Li Yunsheng!

411
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,380
Next one!

412
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,380
Keep it down, all of you!

413
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,660
Right here!

414
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,420
What's this?

415
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,480
Easy, easy now.

416
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,340
Look at this...

417
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,688
What's this embroidery supposed to be?

418
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,155

Li Shande!

446
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,060
Get out here!

447
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,340
Li Shande!

448
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,180
Stop shouting.

449
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,420
Cursed Dong girl,

450
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,260
why are you yelling?

451
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,222
I'm looking for a guy!

452
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:20,980
Get lost.

453
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,279
Important guests stay here.

454
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,300
- Li Shande!
- No one knows you.

455
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,220
Get out now.

456
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,100
Don't push me.

457
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,900
Li Shande!

458
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,860
Leave! Stop yelling!

459
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,180
Li Shande!

460
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,540
Leave!

461
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,180
Stop yelling!

462
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,777
- Help me shout!
- The guests are important.

463
00:23:32,777 --> 00:23:33,420
Stop now!

464
00:23:33,555 --> 00:23:34,620
I'm calling the officials.

465
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,711
- Li Shande!
- Leave now!

466
00:23:35,755 --> 00:23:37,066
Don't touch my litchis!

467
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,740
Li Shande!

468
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,466
- Who is it?
- Li Shande.

469
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,220
Tong?

470
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,060
Why are you here?

471
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,180
I brought you litchis.

472
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,420
Look at these.

473
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,220
So many fresh fruits.

474
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,620
His Majesty can't eat them.

475
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,180
Wouldn't it be a terrible waste?

476
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,300
Thank you, Miss Tong.

477
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,460
Don't mention it.

478
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,500
Eat all you want.

479
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,180
Have you figured out

480
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:02,860
a way

481
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,400
to get the fruits to His Majesty?

482
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,620
With the current preservation methods,

483
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,500
we can only keep the fruits fresh

484
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,260
for up to five days.

485
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,020
That's already the limit.

486
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,700
So,

487
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,888
you can't pull it off?

488
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:21,900
Not necessarily.

489
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,700
To get a fresh litchi

490
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,888
all the way to Chang'an,

491
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,460
besides preservation,

492
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,866
speed matters too.

493
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,740
What are you talking about?

494
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,340
If

495
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,100
I had

496
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,820
a shorter route

497
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,340
and switched to a better horse,

498
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,780
then the pace

499
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,780
might speed up a little.

500
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,200
That'll only buy you a day,

501
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,500
maybe two.

502
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,380
Not necessarily.

503
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,940
I bought a house in Chang'an

504
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,140
with my savings.

505
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,580
Then, I can shave off

506
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,620
the days for litchis

507
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,620
the same way.

508
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,220
It might just work.

509
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,620
But, we must test it.

510
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,780
How do we test it?

511
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,980
Get a few real horses

512
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,540
and run a real trial.

513
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,740
That's the test.

514
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,060
A good, strong workhorse

515
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,180
is right here.

516
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,780
This is the one.

517
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,700
How much is this one?

518
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,620
We can talk price.

519
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,020
It's not expensive.

520
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,020
It's too pricey.

521
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,620
Way too much.

522
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,500
I need one that can go 15 km.

523
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:31,580
All are about the same.

524
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,990
What is he doing?

525
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,110
Asking the price.

526
00:25:37,488 --> 00:25:38,470
That experiment of his

527
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,510
will need a lot of horses and riders.

528
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,270
It's 2500 km.

529
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,630
Even the best riders

530
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,470
on the best horses

531
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,830
can't pull it off.

532
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:46,950
Shut up.

533
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:48,950
In our Dong clan,

534
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,110
we like people like him.

535
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,550
Unlike you,

536
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,110
all talk and no action.

537
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,190
You're just like

538
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,355
a noisy frog in a pond.

539
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,870
Who's all talk and no action?

540
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,070
That litchi job

541
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,070
didn't fall on me anyway.

542
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,870
I don't get what you see in him.

543
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,310
He's so old

544
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:06,600
that he could be your father.

545
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,750
I'll go do the math.

546
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,630
Let me calculate.

547
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,510
Much appreciated.

548
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,350
Thanks a lot.

549
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,030
Don't go.

550
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:18,990
Let's talk again.

551
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,230
How about it?

552
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,390
Are horses expensive?

553
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,710
Things in Lingnan

554
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,590
aren't much cheaper

555
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:38,790
than in Chang'an.

556
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,870
If I want to pull this test off,

557
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,550
I'll need nearly a hundred horses,

558
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,630
and dozens of riders.

559
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:44,710
If you add it all up,

560
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,590
it won't be less than a thousand guan.

561
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,190
That much money?

562
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,155
Can't you cut some costs?

563
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,110
No way.

564
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:53,750
I need the fastest horses

565
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,830
and the best riders.

566
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,550
Otherwise, the result we get

567
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,390
won't mean anything.

568
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,470
So, how are you going to

569
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,310
get the money?

570
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,150
I'll figure it out.

571
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:05,230
Only one mountain left

572
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,950
to conquer.

573
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,430
Mountain?

574
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:09,990
Are you going hiking?

575
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,870
Don't be silly.

576
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,230
It's a metaphor.

577
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,470
It means

578
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,310
he must finish

579
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,430
the job.

580
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,470
He can't stop now.

581
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,550
Thanks for the litchis today.

582
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:22,750
It's getting late.

583
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,133
I'll crunch the numbers in my room.

584
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,430
The way he talks

585
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,670
is so indirect.

586
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:37,830
He could've just said it
in one sentence.

587
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,110
Why go in circles?

588
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,190
You think everyone is like you?

589
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,150
When you speak,

590
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,110
you're an open book.

591
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,510
You always speak it out loud.

592
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,910
So you've got a crush.

593
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:46,550
Why not run up

594
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,830
and propose right now?

595
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,790
So what if I do?

596
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,230
I like hearing him talk.

597
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,800
He sounds smart to me.

598
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,590
Haven't you noticed?

599
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,510
He's not even into you.

600
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,688
He just sees you
as gullible and easy to fool.

601
00:27:57,733 --> 00:27:59,600
He wants your litchis for free.

602
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,670
When he did the math,

603
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,950
he counted horses and riders.

604
00:28:02,022 --> 00:28:03,030
Did he mention the fruits?

605
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,110
Didn't he just say

606
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,150
he's out of money?

607
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,630
Say one more word,
and I won't be so nice.

608
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,870
I still believe in him.

609
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,430
I have faith in him.

610
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:56,110
Report!

611
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,630
Inspector He!

612
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,670
To Inspector He.

613
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,150
How many times have I said this?

614
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,150
My insomnia is severe.

615
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,630
If it's not urgent,

616
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,110
don't bother me.

617
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,110
I feed all of you.

618
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:36,990
What use are you?

619
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:38,510
You all

620
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,470
get to sleep soundly,

621
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,670
while I have to work?

622
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,030
What is it?

623
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,870
Spit it out.

624
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,422
Reporting, Inspector He.

625
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,670
Our men spotted

626
00:29:46,733 --> 00:29:48,910
the Right Chancellor's envoy
Ma Guiyun on the street.

627
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,470
They confirmed at the inn

628
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:52,030
he hadn't returned to Chang'an.

629
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,630
I thought

630
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,750
this was important,

631
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,110
so I came to report.

632
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,830
That is indeed important.

633
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,030
What do you want?

634
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,630
That's what I came to report.

635
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,830
So you're saying Ma Guiyun

636
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,270
stayed in Lingnan?

637
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,310
What for?

638
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,230
Recently,

639
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,950
one of the servants went to the market

640
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,230
and ran into

641
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,070
Guiyun on the street.

642
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,830
When I heard about it,

643
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:19,030
I was both surprised and thrilled.

644
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,350
Surprised that

645
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:23,310
Guiyun still hasn't
headed back to Chang'an.

646
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,590
Thrilled because

647
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,230
I finally had the chance

648
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,710
to sit down with Guiyun

649
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,190
and drink till we dropped.

650
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,310
In the past,

651
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,470
I've been tied up with official duties

652
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,070
and couldn't get away.

653
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,430
Pardon my tardiness.

654
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:41,630
But to think,

655
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,430
he harbored no grudge.

656
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,030
He honored me
by attending the banquet today.

657
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,510
In my heart,

658
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,190
I'm truly moved.

659
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,790
You flatter me, Inspector He.

660
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:58,910
When an elder invites me,

661
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,070
how could I

662
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,670
possibly decline?

663
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:02,830
Look at that.

664
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,670
Good.

665
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,630
Everyone, leave us.

666
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,230
I will

667
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,310
take care of Guiyun myself.

668
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:15,510
Yes.

669
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,150
Forget it.

670
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,070
Dismissed.

671
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,990
Guiyun,

672
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,390
I truly...

673
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,790
This is this year's litchi wine.

674
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:38,950
Freshly brewed.

675
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,830
A specialty of Lingnan.

676
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,710
I hope you'll have a taste, Guiyun.

677
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,270
The first cup...

678
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,550
How should we drink it?

679
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:52,870
I believe

680
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,270
we should all drink it together.

681
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:58,670
Alright.

682
00:32:58,670 --> 00:32:59,620
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

683
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,470
Cheers.

684
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,750
The second cup

685
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:15,030
is for the Right Chancellor.

686
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,910
He may be in Chang'an,

687
00:33:17,977 --> 00:33:19,230
but his heart is with Lingnan.

688
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,270
We respect him deeply.

689
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,150
May he live long.

690
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,350
Drink it all.

691
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,190
Bottoms up.

692
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:31,510
Fate.

693
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,230
Good.

694
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,230
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

695
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,030
Raise it high!

696
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:36,990
Fate.

697
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,350
Cheers.

698
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,470
Drink up! All the way down!

699
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,390
You're from Chang'an.

700
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,350
Show us how it's done.

701
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:43,830
That's right.

702
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,790
Nice!

703
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,150
Very nice.

704
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,030
Impressive!

705
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,310
Who would've thought

706
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,350
your companion died of malaria.

707
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,990
With his final breath,

708
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,390
he passed on the Right Chancellor's
message to you.

709
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:01,910
This cup

710
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,910
is for him.

711
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,430
To him.

712
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,390
Xinmin,

713
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,590
why raise a toast

714
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:11,670
to the deceased?

715
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:15,310
We just sat down.

716
00:34:16,444 --> 00:34:17,430
The food just arrived.

717
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,470
Let's eat.

718
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:19,990
Guiyun,

719
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,030
you're the only one in a hurry.

720
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,310
In a rush

721
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,110
to hand over the military tally?

722
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,110
Now that you've received

723
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,070
the pledge of loyalty,

724
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,311
why the sudden pause?

725
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,830
Is that how you talk to Guiyun?

726
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:53,830
Guiyun

727
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,150
must've received new orders

728
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,630
from the Right Chancellor.

729
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,311
That's not something you can pry into.

730
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,070
Apologize.

731
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:04,830
I was wrong.

732
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,990
I overstepped.

733
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:10,790
This cup of wine

734
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,190
is for Guiyun.

735
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:24,670
May your career

736
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,950
go smoothly as a fish in water.

737
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,470
May you rise with each step.

738
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,190
I came to this banquet

739
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,110
because I value

740
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,190
the bond we share.

741
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,630
With this cup,

742
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,030
I honor our past together.

743
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,670
Tonight's banquet has

744
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,230
fine wine,

745
00:35:59,070 --> 00:35:59,910
fine dishes,

746
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,510
and fine friends.

747
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,190
If anyone brings up work again,

748
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,350
then this won't be a good banquet.

749
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,110
The wine won't taste good.

750
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,070
And I'll have no choice

751
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,790
but to politely excuse myself.

752
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,830
Guiyun...

753
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:40,190
After hearing what you said just now,

754
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:43,630
I think you're absolutely right.

755
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,070
We came here today

756
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,910
to drink, didn't we?

757
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,070
Right?

758
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,270
I propose

759
00:36:52,622 --> 00:36:53,710
we all drink this round

760
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,230
together.

761
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,070
Together!

762
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,590
Just a drink.

763
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,400
- Come.
- Cheers.

764
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,270
Xinmin.

765
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,350
Switch the wine.

766
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,630
We've already served a dozen jugs.

767
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,630
Even if this litchi wine is light,

768
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,750
drinking this much

769
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,870
is still too much for them.

770
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,030
Who told you it's litchi wine?

771
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,333
It's actually ice jade liquor.

772
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,190
Ice jade liquor?

773
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,230
Yeah, this wine

774
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,777
was mixed with a bit of litchi brew

775
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:28,177
to make it taste a little sweeter.

776
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,950
The strength didn't change at all.

777
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,350
Goes down smooth,

778
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,190
but the kick

779
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,030
hits hard later.

780
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,110
Is Mr. Ma still doing alright?

781
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,350
He's fine.

782
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,150
He is

783
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,470
drinking it all by himself.

784
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,830
You can't hold your liquor, huh?

785
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,510
Did you throw up?

786
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:42,870
I didn't.

787
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,390
Neither did I.

788
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,710
I miss Chang'an.

789
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,510
I want to go back.

790
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,350
Tell me,

791
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,310
why won't the Right Chancellor

792
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,630
let me go back?

793
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,070
He even sent a messenger

794
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,790
with a letter...

795
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,670
When I saw that letter

796
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,670
with my new assignment,

797
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,550
I was burning with rage.

798
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,630
I had no place to vent it.

799
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,990
Get lost!

800
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,630
Nowhere to let it out!

801
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,750
Guiyun...

802
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,470
Guiyun...

803
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,710
I have nowhere to vent it.

804
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,190
Brother.

805
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,750
Let me tell you something.

806
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,310
I don't know about anywhere else,

807
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,390
but here in Lingnan,

808
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,670
if anyone dares to piss you off,

809
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:27,910
I'll have them whipped

810
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:28,910
fifty times!

811
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,590
Guiyun...

812
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,550
Tell me, this Right Chancellor...

813
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,990
In that letter of his,

814
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,870
what do you think he could've written?

815
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,470
He wrote...

816
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,510
Wake up.

817
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,350
He wrote...

818
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:51,950
"Let not the golden goblet
face the moon in vain."

819
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,390
Drink first.

820
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,630
We'll talk after drinking.

821
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,910
Finish talking before you drink.

822
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,430
What did the Right Chancellor say?

823
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:02,590
It's maddening. I'm losing it.

824
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:03,790
Drink first.

825
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,950
Drink up!

826
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,310
Come on, spill it.

827
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,230
Everyone.

828
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,030
In Chang'an,

829
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:16,670
once the wine

830
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,790
flows this much,

831
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,510
it's time

832
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,030
to dance.

833
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:41,870
Little buddy.

834
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,470
Chicken daddy.

835
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,350
We're family now.

836
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,030
No keeping secrets.

837
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,350
Tell me.

838
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:03,310
What exactly did the Right Chancellor

839
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,790
write in that letter of his?

840
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,950
Since you're my chicken daddy,

841
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,550
I won't hide it from you.

842
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,310
It's actually just one word.

843
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:24,790
Supervision.

844
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,830
What does "supervision" mean?

845
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,670
Supervision...

846
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,910
From mulberry and hemp
to needle and thread,

847
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,550
to rivers and mountains
that stretch for miles.

848
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,230
And...

849
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,830
Floating duckweeds in water,

850
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,710
birds flying through the woods,

851
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,110
the rise and fall of tides,

852
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,070
sunsets and sunrises!

853
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,630
All of it is under his nose.

854
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,470
Chicken daddy.

855
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,750
Can you say something

856
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,111
the Inspector He can understand?

857
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:01,670
I don't even know

858
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,150
what exactly I'm supervising.

859
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:04,950
I think it's just that

860
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,390
the Right Chancellor cares
deeply about Lingnan

861
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:10,390
and wants me to
supervise everything down here,

862
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,590
whether big or small.

863
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,390
What did I say?

864
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,230
I'm drunk.

865
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,430
I'm drunk.

866
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,430
What did you hear?

867
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,430
I heard nothing.

868
00:41:18,488 --> 00:41:19,190
What did you hear?

869
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,030
I heard nothing.

870
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,510
I am totally drunk!

871
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:22,710
I'm curious.

872
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,790
If you're staying in Lingnan, Guiyun,

873
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:25,710
what's your plan?

874
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:28,230
Lingnan is my turf!

875
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,444
I'm the one watching over Lingnan

876
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,710
for the Right Chancellor.

877
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:35,310
What's that supposed to mean?

878
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:36,870
He doesn't trust me?

879
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,466
He sent someone to keep an eye on me?

880
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,430
Lingnan

881
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,177
is safeguarded by my own brother!

882
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,790
What's there not to trust?

883
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:46,630
Brother.

884
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,470
I'm not leaving.

885
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,870
I want to witness the great views

886
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,310
Lingnan has to offer.

887
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:52,870
It's just...

888
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,350
Brother.

889
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,733
It's going to cost quite a bit.

890
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,270
Brother.

891
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,190
Well...

892
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,030
Brother!

893
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:07,590
Guiyun is under orders

894
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:10,150
to tour Lingnan.

895
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,630
That counts as official duty.

896
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,670
Official duties should be
paid for with state funds!

897
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,350
Yeah!

898
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:19,990
From now on,

899
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,950
all your expenses

900
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,030
will always

901
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,590
be covered by the Inspector's Office.

902
00:42:25,577 --> 00:42:26,670
Tell the Treasury Office,

903
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,590
no matter what he claims,

904
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,333
it's all just paperwork.

905
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:32,950
Drink up!

906
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:34,270
Brother, drink up.

907
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:35,511
Drink up!

908
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:38,830
=The Litchi Road=

909
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,350
These four routes

910
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,590
each have their pros.

911
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,510
I don't expect them all to work.

912
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:44,590
I just want to know

913
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,470
how far the litchis can go.

914
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,870
There's no way I'll let these litchis

915
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,190
get into Chang'an.

916
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:51,670
Either way, I'll die in Chang'an,

917
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:52,630
or I'll die here.

918
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,110
So for these last few months,

919
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:55,350
either let me live freely,

920
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,390
or

921
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:58,444
chop me down. Go on.

922
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,030
Mr. Li.

923
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,630
Cut me down! Kill me!

924
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:01,070
Why you...

925
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:01,910
I'm the Litchi Envoy.

926
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:02,710
I'll make sure

927
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,630
you're all splattered.

928
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,470
Go ahead, kill me!

929
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:08,790
So you're the Litchi Envoy.
