Watchman.

5
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,810
I am Zhao Xinmin,

6
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,730
a fellow townsman of Advisor Wang.

7
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,850
The gentleman is receiving a guest.

8
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,810
Please wait a moment.

9
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,570
Thank you.

10
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,259
Judging by your look,

11
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,370
you're also here to ask
for Advisor Wang's help.

12
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,090
Advisor Wang

13
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,370
is a role model for scholars like us.

14
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,770
I came

15
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,770
just hoping he could give me
some feedback on my essay.

16
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,010
I don't dare ask for a recommendation.

17
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,050
Get out!

18
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,699
Shameless! Absolutely shameless!

19
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,019
You are from a noble family,

20
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,579
and still stoop to this?

21
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,770
Out! Get out!

22
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,090
Out!

23
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,490
Out!

24
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,339
You are just a lowly advisor

25
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,939
in the Court of Judicial Review!

26
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,899
What's the big deal?

27
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,779
Sir.

28
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,170
Let's go.

29
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,050
We're out of tea.

30
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,130
I haven't gone to buy more yet.

31
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,570
I brought this from home.

32
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,770
Please have a taste.

33
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,570
It's only been a few years,

34
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,899
and you've already picked up

35
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,530
the habit of giving gifts.

36
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,330
Have all those books
you read been for nothing?

37
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,650
I am ashamed.

38
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,819
Your writing is top-tier,

39
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,450
yet you live a frugal life.

40
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,610
I deeply admire that.

41
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,730
What brings you here today?

42
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,890
I've studied harder than ever

43
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,090
after failing the exam.

44
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,850
I've written three essays.

45
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,370
Please take a look, sir.

46
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,610
Very good.

47
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,810
Very good.

48
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,610
Excellent.

49
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,570
Writing to express your will!

50
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,810
Especially the quote
about men of virtue.

51
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,899
"They do not cling to life
at the cost of benevolence,

52
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,970
but would sacrifice themselves for it."

53
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,690
To die for virtue,
to uphold righteousness!

54
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,730
Your essay shows great vision.

55
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,490
You are too kind, sir.

56
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,890
Sir, please take a look at this too.

57
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,570
Put it away.

58
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,330
Didn't you hear
what Advisor Wang just said?

59
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,530
This is different.

60
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,330
(Wang's Work)

61
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,130
Sir, is this your painting?

62
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,370
Where did you get this scroll?

63
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,250
I merely stumbled upon it by chance.

64
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,610
To be honest,

65
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,810
a while back,
I couldn't even afford my next meal.

66
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,250
I had no choice

67
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,170
but to trade the painting
for a few pints of rice and flour.

68
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,890
I didn't come here to
present a gift but rather

69
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,170
return it to its rightful owner.

70
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,890
This painting holds lofty meaning.

71
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,210
Only someone as pure and modest as you

72
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,090
is worthy of it.

73
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,890
Your writing also matches
the spirit of this painting.

74
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,570
You shall hang it up for me.

75
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,050
Yes, sir.

76
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,379
Zhao,

77
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,570
I'll give you a boost.

78
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,090
Is this really appropriate?

79
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,690
Go ahead, Zhao.

80
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,250
Very well.

81
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,970
Yes. You have my thanks.

82
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,699
Get on the ground!

83
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,890
Freeze!

84
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:35,859
Get on the ground!

85
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,050
Freeze!

86
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,770
Get on the ground!

87
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,299
The owner of Jubao Store

88
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,499
has already confessed.

89
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,939
You kept consigning your paintings

90
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,290
for sale at the shop.

91
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,650
And if someone wanted a favor,

92
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,939
you'd sell them at high prices,

93
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,370
then split the profit
between the two of you.

94
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,619
Now that we've caught you red-handed,

95
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,050
what else is there to say?

96
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,370
I lost my head for a moment.

97
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,730
I made a mistake!

98
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,570
It was a mistake!

99
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,410
=Episode 11=

100
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,970
Raise your head!

101
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,050
Has anyone here

102
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,810
seen a rat in the residence?

103
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,339
Well?

104
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,530
Anyone?

105
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,050
Zhao,

106
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,619
do you realize

107
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,139
how arrogant the rats are

108
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,739
in the Inspector's Office?

109
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,659
They are bold enough
to scurry right up to me,

110
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,250
just shy of speaking to me!

111
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,059
Are you really blind to them,

112
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,379
or just pretending not to see?

113
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,410
Or are you too scared to speak up?

114
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,339
Seems like you've all
joined the rats' side and

115
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,670
conspired with vermin!

116
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:52,659
We wouldn't dare.

117
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,179
We wouldn't dare!

118
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,499
Wouldn't dare what?

119
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,170
What are you too scared of?

120
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,770
Listen up.

121
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,370
It won't be hard
to get to the bottom of this.

122
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,099
Go.

123
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,530
Bring me that Linyi slave in shackles.

124
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,410
I'll interrogate him myself.

125
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,229
Go on!

126
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,459
That Linyi slave was taken away

127
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,890
by the Litchi Envoy.

128
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,339
Why would the Litchi Envoy

129
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,250
take the Linyi slave?

130
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,170
That Litchi Envoy is way too aggressive.

131
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,170
He shouted at me.

132
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,419
He wanted the document and the slave,
or there'd be bloodshed.

133
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,179
He was terrifying.

134
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,770
I was worried he'd bring bad luck

135
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,419
to the entire residence,

136
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,170
so I gave him the slave.

137
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,299
I even told him deliberately

138
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,050
that the Linyi slave was mute,

139
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,899
so he'd let his guard down.

140
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,419
That way, everything he does

141
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,370
will be under our control.

142
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,490
Master Zhao.

143
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,210
No.

144
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,130
We still need to investigate this.

145
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,330
Inspector.

146
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,619
Speak.

147
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,210
Amita has come to visit.

148
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,699
Amita.

149
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,050
(Inspector's Office)

150
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,410
Godfather.

151
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,530
The servants said
you lost your temper again.

152
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,619
These servants

153
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,139
have no sense of boundaries.

154
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,499
If I don't keep them in line,

155
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,059
they will think I'm easy to fool.

156
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,219
You should calm down.

157
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,690
It's bad for your health.

158
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,450
I know.

159
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,170
What brings you by today?

160
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,170
I heard Su Liang

161
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,859
is investing in litchi transport,

162
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,720
so I came to discuss it with you.

163
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,299
I heard he's found riders and horses

164
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,650
to do a litchi transport trial run.

165
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,019
Do you think that Litchi Envoy

166
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,339
might actually be capable

167
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,570
of pulling this off?

168
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,299
What can he possibly pull off?

169
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,130
Let them fool around.

170
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,339
Su Liang loves gambling
on opportunities.

171
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,050
He likes high-risk and high-reward.

172
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,979
If he weren't sure

173
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,810
this could make money,

174
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,330
he wouldn't put a coin in.

175
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,699
If litchi transport

176
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,379
really is a business opportunity,

177
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,459
I can't let him get a head start.

178
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,219
He is clearly trying to make a comeback

179
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,979
and threaten my place
in the Association.

180
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,450
I have to crush him.

181
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,770
I'm investing in it.

182
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,830
Amita.

183
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,410
Don't get involved
with the litchi business.

184
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,739
There's no way I'll let those litchis

185
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,410
get to Chang'an.

186
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,210
Why not?

187
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,890
Think about it.

188
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,819
If those fresh litchis

189
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,659
actually make it to Chang'an,

190
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,570
and His Majesty likes the taste,

191
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,970
he'll naturally ask,

192
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,930
"Why weren't they delivered before?"

193
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,539
When that happens,

194
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,250
how am I supposed to answer?

195
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,659
Also,

196
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,130
Lingnan has always
been a place for the exiled.

197
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,490
Even birds won't linger here.

198
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,979
And it's exactly because of that

199
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,930
that I get to live like a king.

200
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,059
But if those litchis

201
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,770
really make it to Chang'an,

202
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,690
everything changes.

203
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,699
Lingnan will turn into

204
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,170
a juicy piece of meat.

205
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,610
This place will start thriving.

206
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,450
And the people coming and going

207
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,970
will all be big shots from Chang'an.

208
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,130
Then,

209
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,659
I am nothing more than a rooster

210
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,339
stealing a few grains of rice.

211
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,090
But those folks from Chang'an?

212
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,299
They are all avaricious beasts.

213
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,899
They won't just steal our rice,

214
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,330
they will swallow us whole.

215
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,770
When that day comes,

216
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,370
Lingnan won't be

217
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,330
a place we can call home.

218
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,570
It'll be our graveyard.

219
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,819
Godfather, you are truly far-sighted.

220
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,930
I only thought about
getting ahead in business.

221
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,610
I didn't realize that

222
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,250
it could lie a deadly trap.

223
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,130
Su Liang probably sees it too.

224
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,419
He is trying to open up

225
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,010
a trade route to Chang'an.

226
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,179
Quite the ambition.

227
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,370
Indeed.

228
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,970
Do you think he is really capable of it?

229
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,539
Litchi transport costs a fortune.

230
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,899
With his resources alone,

231
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,410
can he even handle it?

232
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,290
One more thing, Amita.

233
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,050
Remember what I say.

234
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,739
In this world,

235
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,939
it's nearly hard
to make something succeed.

236
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,890
But to ruin something?

237
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,299
Just think about it.

238
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,370
What if Li Shande doesn't have horses?

239
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,690
Then what?

240
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,010
I see.

241
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,490
Dear, are you hungry yet?

242
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,770
No appetite.

243
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,610
How about some sweet soup instead?

244
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,690
You have it.

245
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,570
That old fox...

246
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,419
I think he's found out

247
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,510
about me embezzling
the rat control funds.

248
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,370
Did he get proof?

249
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,819
Thankfully, I planned ahead.

250
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,970
I sent the Linyi slave away.

251
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,650
I cut the problem off at its root.

252
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,170
Now, he has no trail to follow.

253
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,859
You're brilliant, my love.

254
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,890
That old fox is no match for you.

255
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,370
You flatter me.

256
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,259
He is a cunning one.

257
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,050
How else could he become Inspector?

258
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,010
That man...

259
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,019
Sometimes, he acts like a fool,

260
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,259
dense as a pig.

261
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,570
Even talking to him feels pointless.

262
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,130
But sometimes,

263
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,329
he is as shrewd as a monkey.

264
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,520
Take today, for example.

265
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,659
The steward already
had all the rats poisoned.

266
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,259
There was no way he saw one last night.

267
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,179
Yet, he insisted he did.

268
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,699
He just wanted to use it

269
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,490
to rattle me a little.

270
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,370
As if I, the Chief Scribe,

271
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,410
don't do the steward's job as well.

272
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,779
I skim a little off the top.

273
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,219
That's only fair.

274
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,019
Look at him.

275
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,179
He is treating all of Lingnan

276
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,379
like his backyard.

277
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,039
And I can't even build

278
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,859
a little garden.

279
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,979
I am the Chief Scribe
of the Inspector's Office!

280
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,979
Skimming a bit from the rat funds

281
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,930
even sounds pathetic.

282
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,330
Even if he starts suspecting you,

283
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,490
he wouldn't dare touch you.

284
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,699
Without your help,

285
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,170
he can't even write a loyalty pledge.

286
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,299
The man is illiterate.

287
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,579
That much isn't an act.

288
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,050
True enough.

289
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,730
He used to be a pirate.

290
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,699
He can barely

291
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,930
recognize his own name.

292
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,290
That day, he put on such a show.

293
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,299
However, he didn't even know

294
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,850
how to write the word "loyalty."

295
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,299
He still tried to save face.

296
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,459
"Let me test you."

297
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,210
He even made me recite it for him.

298
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,819
Hopeless uneducated.

299
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,530
If I ever resign, he will see

300
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,539
that the whole office

301
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,899
rests on my shoulders.

302
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,459
Without me, it all falls apart.

303
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,650
Indeed.

304
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,179
All your talents are wasted

305
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,770
in the Inspector's Office.

306
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,250
Such brilliance,
met with such poor fortune.

307
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,699
All I do every day is manage chickens

308
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,259
and rats.

309
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,779
I have all these skills,

310
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,090
but I don't even
get to use a tenth of them.

311
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,410
With your talent,

312
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,219
you could serve the emperor

313
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,290
using only half your strength.

314
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,290
If you gave it your all,

315
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,370
you'd rule the world.

316
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,090
Careful.

317
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,250
Words like that can't be spoken lightly.

318
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,299
But, you nearly made it

319
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,210
to the top of the list in Lingnan.

320
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,259
Even if you had gone to Chang'an,

321
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,290
you wouldn't have lost
to those officials.

322
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,930
Back then,

323
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,539
if my father hadn't

324
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,130
stopped you from going to Chang'an,

325
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,050
you'd have made a name
for yourself long ago.

326
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,810
For me...

327
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,130
For me, my dear,

328
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,730
fame and fortune mean nothing.

329
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,859
Staying for you

330
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,330
will never be my regret.

331
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,890
Whenever we sit and talk like this,

332
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,890
my heart always feels lighter.

333
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,970
So, is the rat matter

334
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,539
settled now?

335
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,730
It is.

336
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,659
Thanks to that Litchi Envoy

337
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,010
showing up right on time.

338
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,259
I pulled a little trick.

339
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,410
I shifted the blame elsewhere.

340
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,770
I said he insisted on
taking the Linyi slave away.

341
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,330
Now, all the heat is on him.

342
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,250
Tough luck for the guy.

343
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,250
My dear,

344
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,530
one day,

345
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,330
I'll pluck the moon down just for you.

346
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,930
I want a big mansion!

347
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,859
As the head

348
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,059
of Hu Merchants' Association,

349
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,059
Amita has been

350
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,779
helping He Youguang manage his business.

351
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,939
She must have a lot of dirt

352
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,810
on He Youguang's corruption.

353
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,499
What we need to do now

354
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,210
is drive a wedge between them.

355
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,499
After the Qijing Pavilion fire,

356
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,610
He Youguang gained the most.

357
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,810
Big profit breeds suspicion.

358
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,739
If our guess is right,

359
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,779
and He Youguang is behind

360
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,090
Haihu's death,

361
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,059
then Amita

362
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,419
has spent years grateful to the man

363
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,019
who killed her father.

364
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,890
She will definitely turn on him.

365
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,419
Then, we can win her over

366
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,530
and get all the evidence on He Youguang.

367
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,010
I can get close to her,

368
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,930
but I need a reason.

369
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,499
I told He Youguang

370
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,699
I'm just wandering the world,

371
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,530
not getting involved in his affairs.

372
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,650
So,

373
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,099
how do I get close
without raising suspicion?

374
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,730
An unmarried man doesn't need a reason

375
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,650
to approach an unmarried woman.

376
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,210
"When a gentleman sees
a lovely lady, he longs for her."

377
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,570
Romance?

378
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,770
It's just for show.

379
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,899
At Chang'an banquets,

380
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,419
you've seen it

381
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,739
at least a hundred times.

382
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,050
This is your moment to shine.

383
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,410
No.

384
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,090
I'm just afraid Amita might

385
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,410
fall too deep.

386
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,090
Seriously, don't laugh.

387
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,779
I don't mind being called

388
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,050
a heartless scoundrel.

389
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,979
But, it wouldn't be fair to her.

390
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,739
Then, you are underestimating Amita.

391
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,330
And you are underestimating me.

392
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,290
Fine.

393
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,139
I admit you're charming,

394
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,539
smart, and quick to adapt.

395
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,099
But Amita is sharp-minded

396
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,139
and ruthless when she needs to be.

397
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,490
She wouldn't easily
hand her heart to anyone.

398
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,930
That's why you are
the right one for this.

399
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,579
I've been out of practice

400
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,450
in the art of flirtation for a while.

401
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:37,979
Maybe...

402
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,170
What?

403
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,499
Why are you trying to avoid it?

404
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,979
Don't tell me you've fallen

405
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,939
for someone in Lingnan?
Is that it?

406
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,250
I'll do it.

407
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,699
He Youguang will be at the horse ranch
in the west of the city.

408
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,019
I hear Amita will be there to help

409
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,610
pick horses.

410
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,139
It's the perfect chance

411
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,410
to introduce yourself.

412
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,619
Straw sandals!

413
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,690
Straw sandals! Hemp sandals!

414
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,810
Straw sandals! Hemp sandals!

415
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,050
- Here for a pair of sandals?
- How much?

416
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,019
One copper coin.

417
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,979
One copper coin.

418
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,459
Here, Gou.

419
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,419
These sandals

420
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,579
are comfy and durable.

421
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,659
For me?

422
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,850
Yes.

423
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,739
See if they fit.

424
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,339
Perfect!

425
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,570
Thank you, Qilang!

426
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,099
One coin?

427
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,179
One copper coin.

428
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,379
How is business today?

429
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,570
Not bad.

430
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,379
What's this?

431
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,499
Roasted bamboo rat.

432
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,099
Bamboo rat?

433
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,290
Bamboo rat.

434
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,930
Enjoy your meal.

435
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,490
These days, my mood

436
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,290
is like the mountains in Lingnan.

437
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,890
It's all ups and downs.

438
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,530
Not a moment of peace.

439
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,170
When Ma Guiyun was burned alive,

440
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,930
I cursed the heavens,

441
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,930
blaming fate for
dragging me into this mess.

442
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,450
But now I'm glad.

443
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,579
I've been

444
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,650
led step by step toward the truth.

445
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,490
I have just one goal.

446
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,210
To avenge my father.

447
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,170
That grudge must be repaid.

448
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,619
But, carrying that burden

449
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,779
has stripped you

450
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,490
of your carefree charm.

451
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,850
And it breaks my heart.

452
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,099
All the more reason

453
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,779
I need to succeed in

454
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,970
this fake romance.

455
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,250
You'd hung around banquets in Chang'an,

456
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,450
but you've never had real love.

457
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,850
So, how would you know how to woo a woman?

458
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,890
Your smile is awful, you know.

459
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,690
I don't know how to charm women?

460
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,339
Love is hard, but I'll survive.

461
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,499
I just usually

462
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,659
don't mess around.

463
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,930
I don't flirt for fun.

464
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:52,739
Laugh again,

465
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,779
and I'll slap you silly.

466
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,379
Yes.

467
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,659
You are charming and suave,

468
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,659
and every word is a gem.

469
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,690
Every lady you meet just lights up.

470
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,290
I'll go save the damsel next.

471
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,379
She will be

472
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,810
head over heels for me.

473
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,410
I swear I'll give you a slap.

474
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,010
Splendid!

475
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,330
Trust me, Zhao.

476
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,019
In all of Lingnan,

477
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,890
Amita is the best rider.

478
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,370
Best horse picker? Also Amita.

479
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,499
Sometimes I wonder,

480
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,699
what's Li Shande even doing?

481
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,290
Where is he supposed to get his horses?

482
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,530
I'm honestly stressed on his behalf.

483
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,050
I've planned it out.

484
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,139
When the time comes,

485
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,850
I'll gift him a basket.

486
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,499
I'll look him dead in the eye and say,

487
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,659
"Mr. Li,

488
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,579
why don't you just carry your litchis

489
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,330
on your back to Chang'an?"

490
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,570
He will die from exhaustion!

491
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,659
No more horses for him,

492
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,370
but mules!

493
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,730
He really thinks we're all fools.

494
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,850
Wisdom in foolishness, right?

495
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,490
Big wisdom means intense ignorance.

496
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,770
Real wisdom is real ignorance.

497
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,010
The dumber you look,
the smarter you must be.

498
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,050
I mean, take my brilliance.

499
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,850
Who here is sharp enough to see it?

500
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,970
No one gets it but me.

501
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,210
It's all up in the brain.

502
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,810
Good.

503
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,059
Guiyun.

504
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,330
Inspector He.

505
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,970
- Chief Scribe Zhao.
- Guiyun.

506
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:53,979
As we came down,

507
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,779
I thought those two

508
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,939
looked familiar.

509
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,890
Didn't expect it to really be you.

510
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,010
- What are the odds?
- Yeah.

511
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,339
My goddaughter

512
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,619
loves riding horses.

513
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,930
So we swing by here

514
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,810
whenever to admire the performance.

515
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,330
Guiyun, what brings you here?

516
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,859
I'm looking to pick out a fast steed

517
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,050
just for fun.

518
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,299
That means

519
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,730
Guiyun is a master rider, huh?

520
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,259
I wouldn't go that far.

521
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,339
But I am "Ma" Guiyun.
[*"Ma" means horse in Chinese]

522
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,939
And back in Chang'an,
I loved horseback riding.

523
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,250
My nickname was

524
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,530
"Sassy Rider."

525
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,290
The steed and I are one.

526
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,610
I rode six horses
straight into the ground.

527
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,570
Six of them?

528
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,610
Impressive.

529
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,699
That means

530
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,970
we're in for a real treat today.

531
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,339
Why don't you do a few laps

532
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,139
with Amita later?

533
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,450
Have a little match.

534
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,530
I have two wild horses here

535
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,499
that just broke

536
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,610
three ribs off a stablehand.

537
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,650
Help me break them in, will you?

538
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,139
I...

539
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,219
You got this.

540
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,179
No, back then I was thinner.

541
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,610
Now I'm...

542
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,050
Plus, look at her!

543
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,059
She rides like a warrior queen.

544
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,770
She looks amazing on a horse.

545
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,979
Me going up against her?

546
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,819
That's not even a fair fight.

547
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,010
Oh, it's fair.

548
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,930
Amita!

549
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,930
Come back here.

550
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,730
Come back!

551
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,290
Look at her skills!

552
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,970
Come on.

553
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,050
In all of Lingnan, no one rides better.

554
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,650
Don't you forget it.

555
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,730
My goddaughter, Amita, is the best.

556
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,899
I could hear

557
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,459
you two having a great time

558
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,050
all the way back there.

559
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,419
Amita.

560
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,050
Let me introduce you two.

561
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,419
This is Master Ma Guiyun.

562
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,699
He is from Chang'an.

563
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,170
One of the Right Chancellor's
close confidants.

564
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,810
Mr. Ma.

565
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,610
It's normal to
see delicate young ladies.

566
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,210
It's not rare to meet
daughters of grace.

567
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,859
Now that I've seen her in person,

568
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,330
she's basically a goddess from heaven.

569
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,779
Back in Chang'an, I heard the legends.

570
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,250
The Flower of the Hu Women,

571
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,939
the overlord of the South Seas,

572
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,139
the merchant of Lingnan.

573
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,299
I thought it was

574
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,490
three different people.

575
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,610
Turns out, it's all her.

576
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,259
If Li Yannian ever saw you,

577
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,570
he'd rewrite "Song of a Fair Maiden".

578
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,979
"Down south lives a beauty."

579
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,730
Miss, your beauty is unmatched
in the entire nation.

580
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,899
You flatter me.

581
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,939
My godfather mentioned

582
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,979
the Right Chancellor was sending
an envoy here...

583
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,819
I didn't expect him to be this young

584
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,210
and so refined.

585
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,499
Not at all.

586
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,259
Not at all.

587
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,570
Refined? I am utterly flattered.

588
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,850
But if you hand out
compliments like that...

589
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,459
I'll throw a banquet
at Qifeng Pavilion tonight.

590
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,170
We can get to know each other better.

591
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,379
What a shame.

592
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,339
It just so happens I'm busy with work.

593
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,339
Maybe another time?

594
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,570
How about tomorrow?

595
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,930
Tomorrow it is.

596
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,290
Tomorrow is a good day.

597
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,090
Great. I'll be waiting, miss.

598
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,850
Su.

599
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,899
How is it going
with the horses and riders?

600
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,690
Did you manage to hire them?

601
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,210
I was just about to report.

602
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,299
Amita's been stirring up

603
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,650
trouble at the market.

604
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,290
She is jacking up horse prices.

605
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,059
Is this the same Amita

606
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,619
who snatched your spices?

607
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,459
The very same.

608
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,210
What is she after our horses?

609
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,739
How is she involved

610
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,210
in this matter?

611
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,570
Don't forget,

612
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,050
Amita's godfather is He Youguang.

613
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,819
If you really ship the litchis

614
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,299
out of Lingnan,

615
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,210
the father and daughter's little fortune

616
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,370
won't keep rolling in.

617
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,770
Could you maybe think of a way

618
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,490
to buy some fine horses from Amita?

619
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,690
Amita and I never see eye to eye.

620
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,499
If I go smiling at her,

621
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,450
she will think I'm a weasel

622
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,130
dropping in on a henhouse.

623
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,130
She will become unbelievably ruthless.

624
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,699
That idiom,

625
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,939
while technically wrong,

626
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,210
gets the point across just fine.

627
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,530
How about I go instead?

628
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,419
His Majesty's grace
reaches all four corners.

629
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,419
I act on his behalf.

630
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,539
She can't exactly say no.

631
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,730
Good.

632
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,530
But let me give you a heads-up.

633
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,139
Amita has a cold heart

634
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,930
and a twisted mind.

635
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,210
But, you have strong limbs

636
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,330
and a simple brain.

637
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,459
So go ahead and ask
for a ridiculous number.

638
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,730
Try to get as many horses as you can.

639
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,250
Even if she slashes the number in half,

640
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,090
it will still be

641
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,330
enough for this transport.

642
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,730
Did you get

643
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,130
what I just said?

644
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,090
Got it.

645
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,690
Make a few merchants lock the price in.

646
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,770
No other merchant groups
can take that hit.

647
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,250
Yes.

648
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,530
Leader.

649
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,210
I'm fine.

650
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,490
Thank you for the hard work.

651
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,539
This Tang nobleman

652
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,730
came to see me too?

653
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,250
You must be the leader.

654
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,930
I am the Litchi Envoy from Chang'an.

655
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,139
I'd like to ask you

656
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,370
to sell me a batch of fine horses.

657
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,730
So, you are that Litchi Envoy.

658
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,130
You've caused me quite a bit of trouble.

659
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,739
I haven't even settled our old scores,

660
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,099
and now you show up at my door

661
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,570
to talk business?

662
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,139
I do apologize
for everything that happened.

663
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,219
I am working for His Majesty,

664
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,459
and there are things

665
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,970
beyond my control.

666
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,330
I'm just being honest.

667
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,339
So this time,

668
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,259
I've come to pay you properly

669
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,130
for 130 fine horses.

670
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,850
Please help me out.

671
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,210
What a money-grubbing official you are.

672
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,930
As the saying goes,

673
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,210
you are all cut from the same cloth.

674
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,570
But you are the worst of them all.

675
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,450
Do you need that many
for a few litchis?

676
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,739
I'm not corrupt.

677
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,579
I have it all planned out.

678
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,299
I designed four separate routes.

679
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,920
The first goes through the Mei Pass.

680
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,920
The second takes the West Capital Circuit.
That's the closest to the capital.

681
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,139
The third heads north, crossing the Yangtze.

682
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,210
The fourth is also by water.

683
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,379
Each route needs

684
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,219
fifteen transfer points.

685
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,579
So that's sixty

686
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,979
transfer points in total.

687
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,179
And each transfer point

688
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,299
needs horses,

689
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,459
boats, and riders.

690
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,259
That's why I need

691
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,090
130 fine horses.

692
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,770
Even so,

693
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,259
with losses included,

694
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,770
100 horses would be enough.

695
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:04,979
Why did you open with

696
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,370
a request for 130?

697
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,010
Well, I was just accounting for

698
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,770
the bargaining losses too.

699
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,010
At least you are honest.

700
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,899
I bought a batch

701
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,410
for the association.

702
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,139
But, those horses

703
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,619
are already out delivering cargo.

704
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,219
They won't be back anytime soon.

705
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,339
So I'm afraid

706
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,850
I really can't help you.

707
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,819
Surely not every last one of them

708
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,019
is out on the road?

709
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,059
There has been a rush

710
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,410
of shipments at the docks,
and not enough transport.

711
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,690
We truly can't spare even a single horse.

712
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,659
I know this is

713
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,179
a rush job given by His Majesty.

714
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,019
So, don't waste

715
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,250
any more time with me.

716
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,490
But there is one thing

717
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,490
you might want to know.

718
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,090
I don't mind letting go
of the litchi garden.

719
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,739
But the debt it owes

720
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,930
must be repaid.

721
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,410
We Hu people

722
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,699
always repay kindness

723
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,290
and settle our debts.

724
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,610
The money was borrowed
when the irises bloomed.

725
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,090
If it's not repaid
before the petals fall,

726
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,050
we'll chop the debtor's hand off.

727
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,530
It's too hot in Lingnan.

728
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,810
These irises don't grow too well.

729
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,810
They probably won't last many more days.

730
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,810
Leader,

731
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,730
the Dong people from the garden

732
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,730
still need to help me
transport the litchis.

733
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,019
Can I beg you

734
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,370
to let them off the hook?

735
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,099
As a leader,

736
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:36,659
I must consider

737
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,250
the Hu merchants' interests.

738
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,379
Even if I let them go,

739
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,939
the others in charge won't agree.

740
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,530
I can vouch for them.

741
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,219
After the sixth month of the year,
they will pay it back.

742
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,410
How about that?

743
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,019
You sure you will live till then

744
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,450
to see it happen?

745
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,059
Leader, you mentioned

746
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,419
the iris blooming.

747
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,859
If the debt is to be paid
before it withers.

748
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,659
What if

749
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,139
the flower doesn't wither?

750
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,059
Does that mean we can

751
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,250
delay the repayment?

752
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,419
Could I take it home

753
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,010
and tend to it?

754
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,819
Do you think you can save it?

755
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,010
I can.

756
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,090
Let me take a look.

757
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,939
When it comes to flowers,

758
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,219
if they're in my hands,

759
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,650
they won't suffer.

760
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,250
Let me take it and try.

761
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,939
And if it dies?

762
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,410
Punish me however you want.

763
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,739
Now, is there any wiggle room

764
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,290
with the horse deal?

765
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,850
I already agreed to one thing.

766
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,970
Don't push your luck.

767
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,210
See him out.

768
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,610
Yes.

769
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,890
Envoy Li, this way.

770
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,650
I'll take the flower with me.

771
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,619
This Litchi Envoy

772
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,859
should know his place.

773
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,019
He can barely help himself,

774
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,690
yet he still worries about the Dong people.

775
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,339
I don't think he is

776
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,970
as devious as my godfather claims.

777
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,090
He actually seems kind of dumb.

778
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,979
Unlike the other

779
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,170
the Tang officials.

780
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,979
True integrity may look naive,
and true skill, a little dumb.

781
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,410
Maybe he's just faking it.

782
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,450
There is an old Hu proverb.

783
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,970
"Camels carry loads,

784
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,090
but eagles are meant to fly."

785
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,570
He might actually have some real talent.

786
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,290
With the right help,

787
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,890
this might not be impossible.

788
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,010
Are you tempted, Leader?

789
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,250
It's just business.

790
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,330
I won't go against
my godfather's interests.

791
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,570
Why aren't you eating or drinking now?

792
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,979
Fussing over flowers

793
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,370
and forgetting to rest?

794
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,210
Rest?

795
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,810
I'm just like
this wilted flower in the jar,

796
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,930
struggling to stay alive.

797
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,899
Didn't you already get

798
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,370
the funding to start the trial?

799
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,210
Something came up?

800
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,499
Ever since I became

801
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,450
the Litchi Envoy,

802
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,659
Chang'an doesn't care,

803
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,170
and Lingnan won't listen.

804
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,539
Only Su and Tong

805
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,930
have given me any real help.

806
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,690
Finally Su lent me money.

807
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,810
Then, Amita snatched up the horses.

808
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,490
And Tong,

809
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,130
who helped me pick litchis,

810
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,530
is being hunt down by Amita for debts.

811
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,210
Amita?

812
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,450
Even my brother-in-law's
annoyed by her.

813
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,410
What do you mean "even"?

814
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,059
You know her?

815
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,370
Not me.

816
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,930
Ma Guiyun does.

817
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,579
Ma Guiyun's next task

818
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,210
is to get close to Amita.

819
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,970
Let's not talk about that now.

820
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,570
You mentioned

821
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,610
Amita had taken your horses?

822
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,850
Not really.

823
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,730
I went to the stables.

824
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,219
I think it was He Youguang

825
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,850
who told her not to give them to you.

826
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,419
Then, I don't get it.

827
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,659
They are fine sending rare treasures

828
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,899
from Lingnan to Chang'an,

829
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,499
but why can't they tolerate

830
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,410
a few litchis going up north?

831
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,499
Rare treasures

832
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,250
go to the Right Chancellor.

833
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,130
That is their golden ticket.

834
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,459
Litchis go to His Majesty.

835
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,050
That's someone else's win.

836
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,619
Those two have had

837
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,979
the Lingnan pie to themselves.

838
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,619
They are not about to share it.

839
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,859
I don't know politics,

840
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,899
or how the world works.

841
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,410
I just do my job.

842
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:03,979
Tomorrow I'll ask

843
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,290
He Youguang for horses.

844
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,659
It won't work.

845
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,699
He will make up an excuse
and brush you off.

846
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,739
Then, what do I do?

847
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,539
Without horses,

848
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,099
I can't run the experiment.

849
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,090
And if I can't run it, I die.

850
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,850
What are you laughing at?

851
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,170
You still have me!

852
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,859
Who am I?

853
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,530
I'm Ma Guiyun!

854
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,130
Just leave it to me to pull some strings

855
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,650
and get it done for you.

856
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,019
You don't believe me?

857
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,250
In a few days, I'll have Amita

858
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,779
stand before you, all prim, proper,

859
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,819
and respectful,

860
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,419
with hundreds of fine horses lined up

861
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,130
for you to pick from.

862
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,850
Come on, eat.

863
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:10,690
(Wind)

864
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,250
Guiyun, sorry to keep you waiting.

865
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,459
With how busy you are
with the association,

866
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,330
it's my honor just to be able

867
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,930
to have a word with you.

868
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,810
What's a short wait compared to that?

869
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,850
Please, after you.

870
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,250
Truth is, I don't like socializing.

871
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,650
Unless it's a banquet for business,

872
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,930
I don't attend any unrelated gatherings.

873
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,970
But Guiyun,

874
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,090
you've come all the way from Chang'an.

875
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,419
If I didn't come in person

876
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,699
to tell you myself,

877
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,290
you might think I was brushing you off.

878
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,450
I appreciate your honesty.

879
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,819
Now I understand

880
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,650
your temperament and ways.

881
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,930
I won't invite you lightly in the future.

882
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,210
I'm not here today

883
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,050
to exchange sweet nothings.

884
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,570
I wanted

885
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,650
to give you a gift.

886
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,939
Guiyun,

887
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,530
you shouldn't have.

888
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,650
What I want to give you

889
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,090
is a suggestion.

890
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,539
I heard the Litchi Envoy

891
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,170
is in need of fine horses.

892
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,259
And all the good ones in the market

893
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,330
have ended up in your hands.

894
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,770
My advice is...

895
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,090
Let him have them.

896
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:32,419
You came today to put up
a good word for that Litchi Envoy?

897
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,730
Of course not.

898
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,099
Though we both come

899
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,850
from Chang'an,

900
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,610
our missions are different.

901
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,770
I serve the Right Chancellor.

902
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,419
Why would I speak on behalf

903
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,610
of a Litchi Envoy?

904
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,339
We just happen to be

905
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,810
staying at the same inn.

906
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,530
And by chance,

907
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,419
I saw him going over

908
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,970
Lingnan's accounts.

909
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,259
He is just a Litchi Envoy,

910
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,290
and he dares to audit the ledgers?

911
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,370
He clearly doesn't know his place.

912
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,410
You shouldn't underestimate him.

913
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,179
I've seen

914
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,930
plenty of men like him in Chang'an.

915
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,890
They are usually overlooked nobodies,

916
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,059
but the moment they are

917
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,690
given even a sliver of power,

918
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,890
they turn into rabid mutts.

919
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,139
Lately, he's been down at the docks,

920
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,090
counting merchant ships.

921
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,139
He has also looked into

922
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,210
Lingnan's tax records from recent years.

923
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,450
He trained in mathematics.

924
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,850
He barely needs the numbers
before spotting something fishy.

925
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,250
If he gets ahold of anything solid...

926
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,970
I'm sure you wouldn't want

927
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,179
a man like that

928
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,530
sinking his teeth into you.

929
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,490
It's just not worth the risk.

930
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,170
You're telling me all this

931
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,890
because you

932
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,530
want to help me?

933
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,379
I came to Lingnan on orders

934
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,890
from the Right Chancellor.

935
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,410
Your godfather has shown me
nothing but kindness.

936
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,459
You're not an outsider.

937
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,570
Of course I wouldn't turn a blind eye.

938
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,890
Since you don't care for small talk,

939
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,730
I'll take my leave.

940
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,579
Before you arrived,

941
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,610
I already ordered a few dishes.

942
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,170
Please enjoy.

943
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,330
Goodbye.

=The Litchi Road=

945
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,650
You and I should be comrades in arms.

946
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,259
But, we both admire the same beauty.

947
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,499
I missed my chance.

948
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,699
But you still have yours.

949
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,490
You have the talent?

950
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,090
And the looks too?

951
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,330
How shallow of me.

952
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,210
Let me help you once more.

953
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,050
I'll give you another push.

954
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,810
You...

955
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,290
