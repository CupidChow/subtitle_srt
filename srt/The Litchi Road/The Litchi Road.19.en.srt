00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,900
(Veronica Polita Fries)

3
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,460
(Hongni Embroidery)

4
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,140
Father,

5
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,019
Alley Master shared
some osmanthus cake today.

6
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,860
Everyone has a piece.

7
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,420
I save it up for you.

8
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,460
It's okay.

9
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,500
You can take it home

10
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,580
and enjoy it yourself.

11
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,500
No, you eat it.

12
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,100
You once said that wherever you went

13
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:03,420
and saw something tasty,
you wanted to share it with me.

14
00:02:03,622 --> 00:02:05,000
So when I saw something delicious,

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,311
I wanted to share it with you too.

16
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,940
So eat it.

17
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,870
You're unbelievable.

18
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,740
Fine, I'll eat it.

19
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,140
It's sweet.

20
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:23,777
Isn't this veronica polita fries?

21
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,700
You often have leg soreness

22
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:27,260
and use it to reduce the swelling.

23
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,300
As I watched you decoct it,

24
00:02:29,688 --> 00:02:31,020
I remembered what it looks like.

25
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,060
This one.

26
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,180
Next time,

27
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,022
just embroider hubing for me.

28
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,180
Is food all you care about?

29
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,540
=Episode 19=

30
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:25,810
Move it.

31
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,820
It's okay, Mr. Feng.

32
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,380
I'm here

33
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,620
to inquire about someone.

34
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,380
His name is Tu.

35
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,810
You introduced him to my father

36
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,060
to sell his two thousand shares, right?

37
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,940
Didn't you say

38
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,140
you won't bring up the past again?

39
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,622
Why are you bringing it up now?

40
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,340
I heard he's still alive.

41
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,820
Who says so?

42
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,770
He already died

43
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,940
in the Qijing Pavilion fire.

44
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,540
If you keep lying,

45
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,140
I'll throw you

46
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,333
and drown you in the water.

47
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,620
I really don't know anything.

48
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,460
Stop scaring him.

49
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,580
Come here.

50
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,350
Mr. Feng,

51
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,420
ignore his threats.

52
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,644
Don't be scared.

53
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,540
Mr. Feng.

54
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,740
If you tell me,

55
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,700
I'll pay for your treatment.

56
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,660
Lift it.

57
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,440
When there are opportunities,
there are a lot of swindlers too.

58
00:04:26,444 --> 00:04:27,466
So you should be cautious.

59
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,690
I came to find

60
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,820
(Tu)
a distant cousin here in Lingnan.

61
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,260
I heard

62
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,850
he made good money here.

63
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,330
Is that so? What's his name?

64
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,580
His name is Zhen Haidong.

65
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,180
Oh, Master Zhen.

66
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,180
His shops take up several streets.

67
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,488
Come, I'll lead the way.

68
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,980
Free of charge.

69
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,940
Thanks!

70
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,650
What should I call you?

71
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,540
Just Tu.

72
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,444
(Gaozhou)
Nice to meet you, Tu.

73
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,180
By the way,

74
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,888
I have a great
money-making opportunity.

75
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,380
How about you join me?

76
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,980
Didn't you just say

77
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,460
Lingnan is full of swindlers

78
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,066
and all say the same thing.

79
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:07,740
Their opening line is always,

80
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,780
"I have a good
money-making opportunity."

81
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,580
This is different.

82
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,740
It's totally reliable.

83
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,688
That's the next thing
swindlers would say too.

84
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,100
Come closer.

85
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,020
Listen.

86
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,940
I'm working on something

87
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,420
called the Sea Sail Fund.

88
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,740
Here is how it works.

89
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,260
You buy a share,

90
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,180
and when the fleet
makes money,

91
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,100
you'll get a cut.

92
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,100
And if it loses money?

93
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,540
Won't I lose it all?

94
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,540
No way.

95
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,050
Do you know

96
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:48,980
who owns this fleet?

97
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,980
Who?

98
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,220
Haihu.

99
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,220
He's the powerhouse

100
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,060
in Nanyang.

101
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,820
Out there, it's like his own waters.

102
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,300
Any other fleets would fail

103
00:05:58,577 --> 00:06:00,020
but not his.

104
00:06:00,911 --> 00:06:03,140
So, don't you think
this fund is worth investing in?

105
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,460
If it's Haihu,

106
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,660
it's worth a try.

107
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,700
That's more like it.

108
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,020
But

109
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,740
you better act fast.

110
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,540
People are rushing to buy in.

111
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,100
If I get my cut,

112
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,140
I can stop struggling to survive here.

113
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:26,490
I can return to my hometown

114
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,780
and brag all day.

115
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,300
I have 2,000 shares.

116
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,860
You have 2,000 shares?

117
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,620
Everyone is scrambling
to buy the funds...

118
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,180
Who would let go of such a big sum?

119
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,700
Is it safe?

120
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,540
It came from a nobleman,

121
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,140
a very discreet one.

122
00:06:45,222 --> 00:06:46,100
Don't ask too much.

123
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,555
But I assure you that it's solid.

124
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,690
Didn't you say

125
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,200
Master Zhen is your distant cousin?

126
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,180
You can introduce him to me.

127
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,700
This deal is solid.

128
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,540
He'll definitely buy for sure.

129
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,100
Once he makes a profit,

130
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,620
he'll surely give you a cut.

131
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,420
Then you'll be rich.

132
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:13,540
Not only will you look good
when you go home,

133
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,488
but your whole family
will also be proud.

134
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,140
God, it burns...

135
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,260
Help... Help...

136
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,300
You heartless wretch.

137
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,020
Qijing Pavilion burned down last night.

138
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,180
They all said Haihu was dead.

139
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,100
He left as soon as he got well.

140
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,380
What's the point

141
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,980
of confronting him?

142
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,580
He told me not to say

143
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,540
I had seen him

144
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,140
and I definitely can't let anyone know

145
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,380
that he is still alive.

146
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,100
He said

147
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,380
it would put him in danger.

148
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,740
So you never saw him after that?

149
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,460
Just once.

150
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,060
He asked me to deliver medicine
to Dayu Ridge.

151
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,780
He gave me some money,

152
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,700
so I made the trip.

153
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,100
Other than that,

154
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,260
I never saw him again.

155
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,511
Where did you see him?

156
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,220
We met in a small tavern.

157
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,780
You went asking around yourself?

158
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,220
I did.

159
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,420
But Lan has been in Lingnan for years.

160
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,970
He knows many people

161
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:59,820
and is well-connected.

162
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,340
Even he couldn't find anything.

163
00:09:01,755 --> 00:09:03,488
So, what's the point of me trying?

164
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,340
But Lan knows He Youguang too.

165
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,940
Can he be trusted?

166
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,020
They're just acquaintances.

167
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,980
Back in the day,

168
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:15,980
Lan's father owned shops
all over the city.

169
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,180
Then

170
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,620
He Youguang took them all.

171
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,860
Do you think Lan can let that go?

172
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,740
Besides, he wants to find Tu too.

173
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,340
He wants to know

174
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,500
how his father
lost everything back then.

175
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,660
This goes too deep.

176
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,820
Telling you won't help

177
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,022
and won't benefit you either.

178
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,860
Even digging this far wasn't easy.

179
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,980
So, what did he say

180
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:37,111
the tavern's name again?

181
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,420
It's called

182
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,100
Dukangli.

183
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,079
Where are you going?

184
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,050
To look for clues.

185
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:05,580
Isn't this cocklebur?

186
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,460
Notice anything different?

187
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,540
What

188
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,860
difference?

189
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,260
This cocklebur is bigger.

190
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,580
Both ends are pointed

191
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,580
and curl upward.

192
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,220
The ones from Lingnan are smaller.

193
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,500
I've only ever seen
this kind in one place.

194
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,340
Where?

195
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,580
Litchi garden.

196
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:33,259
I once saw this type of large cocklebur

197
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,666
on a Great Shaman from Dayu Ridge.

198
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,060
If I'm right,

199
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,980
it's native

200
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,140
to that mountain.

201
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,300
So if it was found near the tavern,

202
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,450
that means someone from Dayu Ridge

203
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,460
must have been there.

204
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,660
If we can find

205
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,860
this cocklebur,

206
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,700
we will be able to find Tu.

207
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,660
Mr. Li,

208
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:04,533
there are cockleburs everywhere here.

209
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,620
We're near the city's edge now.

210
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,820
Almost no one lives out here.

211
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,500
Let's check ahead.

212
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:44,340
Let's head over there.

213
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,222
I can't believe
we actually found something.

214
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,860
Who's there?

215
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,260
We're peddlers.

216
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,220
Do you sell sewing supplies?

217
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:22,180
Any adults I can speak to?

218
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,180
My uncle's out.

219
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,460
You can't see?

220
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,460
I can't.

221
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,780
But I'm used to it.

222
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,700
Are you really selling things?

223
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:36,177
We've been out of sewing supplies
for a while.

224
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,860
Uh...

225
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,500
We do sell them.

226
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,900
He...

227
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,644
He didn't bring enough.

228
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:45,980
He went back to get more.

229
00:12:46,022 --> 00:12:46,940
He will go and get them.

230
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,900
Buy them.

231
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,444
He'll figure it out. Just wait a bit.

232
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:50,355
Go and get the supplies.

233
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,777
He'll be back soon.

234
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,460
Are you buying sewing supplies
for embroidery?

235
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,220
I have a daughter

236
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,210
about your age.

237
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,400
She is learning embroidery too.

238
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:06,580
I'll show you her work.

239
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,260
Take a look.

240
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,900
This is her work.

241
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,300
I can't see.

242
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,660
Can I feel it?

243
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,500
Sure, here you go.

244
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,220
Over here. Feel it.

245
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,900
What flower is this?

246
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:42,940
It's veronica polita fries.

247
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,300
Such fine stitching.

248
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,540
You know embroidery?

249
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,860
I've always wanted to learn.

250
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,577
Even though I can't see,

251
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,820
I can feel.

252
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,420
You're made for embroidery.

253
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,550
People say

254
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,500
blind folk have better touch.

255
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,260
Your work would be
delicate and beautiful.

256
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,340
Your fingers are so nimble.

257
00:14:15,933 --> 00:14:17,340
You have the hands for embroidery.

258
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,740
Really?

259
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,820
But I can't leave home.

260
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,220
Your parents won't let you learn it?

261
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,860
I don't have parents.

262
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,730
I live

263
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,740
with an uncle.

264
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,340
I've never told him about it.

265
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,420
Besides,

266
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,888
no embroidery workshop
would take a blind girl.

267
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,900
That's not true.

268
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,100
Have you heard of Chang'an?

269
00:14:42,044 --> 00:14:42,980
Yes, I've heard of it.

270
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,977
That's where His Majesty lives.

271
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:45,980
Yeah.

272
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,370
Chang'an

273
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,260
has many embroidery workshops

274
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,850
with very famous

275
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,777
blind embroiderers.

276
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,540
They're masters.

277
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,170
They embroider patterns

278
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,900
such as dragons, phoenixes,

279
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,860
qilin,

280
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,620
and peonies.

281
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,740
All is good there.

282
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,620
They must be amazing.

283
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,180
I can't imagine patterns like that.

284
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,220
How do they do it?

285
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:11,980
With the heart.

286
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,740
Anything done with heart

287
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,340
can be done no matter how hard it is.

288
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,260
So, is it just you and your uncle?

289
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,620
What about the rest of the family?

290
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,790
I can talk to them about this.

291
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,180
There's no one else.

292
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,060
It's just the two of us.

293
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,180
Then

294
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,900
is he your real uncle?

295
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,540
No.

296
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,260
I was born blind.

297
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:43,733
I wandered everywhere as a child.

298
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,500
I once got lost

299
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,180
and somehow ended up here

300
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,740
without knowing how.

301
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,060
He gave me a rice cake.

302
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,250
Then I told him

303
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,940
what happened.

304
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,500
He let me stay.

305
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,740
He sounds like a good man.

306
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,700
So,

307
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,380
what's his name?

308
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,860
I don't know.

309
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,444
Has he talked about himself?

310
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,700
No.

311
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,460
Then

312
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,660
does he...

313
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,860
Does he have any features you remember?

314
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,340
Features?

315
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,900
Oh, right. You can't see.

316
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,100
I've touched his face before.

317
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,820
He has many scars.

318
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:26,666
His whole face is covered with them.

319
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,700
I think his face

320
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,980
must be scary to look at.

321
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:31,222
Are those burn scars?

322
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,180
I think so.

323
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,260
It's the same as the scar I have

324
00:16:34,288 --> 00:16:35,555
when I burn myself with hot oil.

325
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,740
Sewing...

326
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,820
These are...

327
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,866
See? What did I say earlier?

328
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,350
Sewing...

329
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,090
The sewing supplies are here.

330
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,466
He has brought the supplies here.

331
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,466
They're here.

332
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:53,330
Not only do we have sewing supplies,

333
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,500
we have everything you need.

334
00:16:54,511 --> 00:16:55,533
Here is your sewing supply.

335
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,580
Have some crispy rice cakes.

336
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,820
Thank you.

337
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,340
This is tasty.

338
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:20,140
How much for the sewing supplies?

339
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,500
No charge. It's free.

340
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,780
(Sea Sail Fund. 2,000 Shares)

341
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,060
So?

342
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,740
It should be Tu.

343
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,660
That girl's uncle.

344
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,650
She said he went fishing

345
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,155
and would be back in three days.

346
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,140
We can't alert him too soon.

347
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,620
What if he comes back early?

348
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,300
The girl

349
00:17:47,755 --> 00:17:49,540
would tell him
two strangers came asking.

350
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,540
He'll be on guard.

351
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,460
He might flee.

352
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,420
Do you know any embroidery workshops?

353
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,260
Embroidery workshops?

354
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,180
Well,

355
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,311
my old tenant ran one.

356
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,780
See? I knew we would need you.

357
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,100
Let's head back.

358
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,980
Did you forget something?

359
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,540
No.

360
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,266
Actually, I came to ask

361
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,133
if you really want
to go to an embroidery workshop?

362
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,060
I really do.

363
00:18:37,488 --> 00:18:39,300
But I need to wait
till my uncle comes back

364
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,500
and talk to him.

365
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,780
Here's the thing.

366
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,260
This gentleman knows

367
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,140
the workshop owner.

368
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,100
He can ask

369
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,140
if they'd be willing

370
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,460
to take you in.

371
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,300
Really?

372
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,340
Yes.

373
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,260
We will come again

374
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,300
in three days.

375
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,700
Also,

376
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,340
if your uncle returns earlier
than scheduled,

377
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,100
don't tell him about this just yet.

378
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,140
We haven't worked things out yet.

379
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:06,980
If it fails,

380
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,100
he'll just be disappointed.

381
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,060
But if it works out,

382
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,940
you can always surprise him.

383
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,780
Deal?

384
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,540
Why are you being so nice to me?

385
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,777
I told you, didn't I?

386
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,060
I have a daughter

387
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,180
about your age.

388
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,860
Here.

389
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,780
I'll leave you

390
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,180
the handkerchief

391
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,940
she embroidered

392
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,500
and let it be our promise,

393
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,340
okay?

394
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,820
Then it's a deal.

395
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,100
Any news on Tu?

396
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,570
We found

397
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,540
where he lives.

398
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,340
We are certain he's alive.

399
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,540
Didn't I say so?

400
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,340
What did I say?

401
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,100
Have you seen him in person?

402
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,860
Well, no.

403
00:20:05,244 --> 00:20:06,700
But the girl said he went fishing

404
00:20:06,711 --> 00:20:08,200
and would be back in three days.

405
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,740
Whether we can find a shortcut can

406
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,340
only be left to wait and see.

407
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,980
We'll find him!

408
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,100
Right, Aunt Chai?

409
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,740
When have I ever been wrong?

410
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,820
It's settled then.

411
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,340
Anyway, Jun and Hao are dancing

412
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,900
the couple dance tonight.

413
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,100
Then let us

414
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,980
all celebrate it.

415
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,600
Yes, let's celebrate it.

416
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,540
Mr. Li, please help yourself.

417
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:37,622
Congratulations. I'm happy for you two.

418
00:20:37,688 --> 00:20:38,540
Thank you, Mr. Li.

419
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,540
Thank you.

420
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,060
Have a taste.

421
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,420
Taste it.

422
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,020
Mr. Su, I

423
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,580
have digestive issues.
How about you enjoy it?

424
00:20:54,355 --> 00:20:56,133
Mr. Li,
how about trying something new?

425
00:20:56,711 --> 00:20:58,260
I... I would like to propose a toast.

426
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,500
I want to propose a toast.

427
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,380
Then...

428
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,580
- All right.
- A toast!

429
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,500
A toast to all of you.

430
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,340
We've all gathered here in Lingnan

431
00:21:14,711 --> 00:21:15,820
and put in so much effort

432
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,220
for the litchi transport.

433
00:21:18,488 --> 00:21:19,860
Everybody has been so busy

434
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,740
that I haven't had the chance

435
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,420
to thank you all properly.

436
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,060
I am deeply sorry.

437
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,980
The transport of litchi

438
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:30,133
is a matter of life and death
for my family.

439
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,140
So I must pour my heart and soul into it

440
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,460
sparing no effort

441
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,020
to survive this crisis.

442
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,740
I will never forget

443
00:21:39,155 --> 00:21:40,844
all the help you've given me.

444
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,300
It's etched in my heart.

445
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,900
And one day, if these litchis
make it to Chang'an,

446
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,300
I'll be forever grateful

447
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,980
for your kindness.

448
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,140
Now the most important thing

449
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,620
is wishing Jun and Hao

450
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:57,666
a happy future, and lots of children!

451
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,620
Healthy ones.

452
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,900
Healthy ones.

453
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,860
I'll drink to that!

454
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,420
Well said!

455
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,260
Cheers!

456
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,650
Bottoms up.

457
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,490
Thank you, Mr. Li.

458
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,260
Congratulations.

459
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,180
Mr. Li,

460
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,620
I'm just a lowly trader

461
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,060
who was nearly ruined

462
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:25,540
by treachery.

463
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,740
But fate brought me to you

464
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,820
like a miracle.

465
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,180
You brought me back from the dead.

466
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,020
To me,

467
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,860
you are noble,
and unmatched in skill and character.

468
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,450
You...

469
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,660
You're like a stick of incense

470
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,580
that is pure and calming.

471
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,740
In all my years in business,

472
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,300
I've never met anyone

473
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,940
as honest as you.

474
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,300
If the transportation
of litchi succeeds,

475
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,220
I'll have stories to brag about
to my grandchildren.

476
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,660
I'll say I played a bigger part

477
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,940
than even the boss!

478
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,340
By then,

479
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,300
I'll be too proud to know what's what!

480
00:23:12,955 --> 00:23:14,180
Come, let's share this drink

481
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,860
to the end!

482
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,620
Together to the end!

483
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,580
Together to the end.

484
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,109
Let me speak some truth

485
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,200
(Bamboo Wine)
after this drink.

486
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,860
Compared to clever people,

487
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,140
you're a big fool.

488
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,180
So much so

489
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,220
that I couldn't bear to deceive you.

490
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,140
But calling you foolish

491
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,380
isn't quite right.

492
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,980
You're brilliant, clever,

493
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,060
and ingenious.

494
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,900
Your talent

495
00:23:58,711 --> 00:23:59,980
is unmatched in this world.

496
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,180
I'm not like

497
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,580
those flatterers in court.

498
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,100
I don't know how to sweet-talk.

499
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,079
I took
the Imperial Mathematics Examination.

500
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,129
So numbers are what I know.

501
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,020
It's not like you said.

502
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,500
Okay, I won't beat around the bush.

503
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,020
I want

504
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,540
to tell you a secret.

505
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,420
At first,

506
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,140
all I wanted was

507
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,500
to trade for a pangolin from you.

508
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,660
I didn't care one bit
about litchi transportation.

509
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,170
But then I saw

510
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,380
some opportunity

511
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,100
to make a profit.

512
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,620
So I was blinded by money

513
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,060
and decided to exaggerate
a bit on your behalf.

514
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,170
I hope you won't mind my shortcomings

515
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,010
and please

516
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,940
don't look down on me.

517
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,820
Of course, not.

518
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,580
Mr. Su, If it weren't

519
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,780
for your help

520
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,020
by lending money to me,

521
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,260
I'd probably have jumped into

522
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,140
the river by now.

523
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,180
I will remember

524
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,580
your kindness

525
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,660
in my heart for the rest of my life.

526
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,250
Cheers to the end.

527
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,090
To the end.

528
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,860
Cheers.

529
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,340
Let's drink!

530
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,100
Drink! Drink! Drink!

531
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,380
Come on, keep drinking!

532
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:34,940
Drink it! Drink it!

533
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,540
Good man!

534
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,140

it's probably family matters
that worry him.

570
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,620
Only when drunk

571
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,420
can he

572
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,340
let loose like this.

573
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,420
City folks

574
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,100
are more complicated than us.

575
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,020
I worry

576
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,660
you're too close to them.

577
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,860
It might bring you

578
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,500
some trouble.

579
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,260
It won't.

580
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,540
Li Shande won't harm me.

581
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,860
He's different from the others.

582
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,660
I know he's an honest man.

583
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,620
I can tell

584
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,860
he genuinely wants to help us.

585
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,820
But life in the city

586
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,220
is full of helplessness.

587
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,540
Even he can't control

588
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,700
everything.

589
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,460
If that day comes,

590
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,580
your litchi garden

591
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,100
won't be able

592
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,700
to stay the same.

593
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,260
Master Konglang,

594
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,140
Tu will meet my brother-in-law

595
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,620
in three days.

596
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,740
Then we can find out who started

597
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,500
the Sea Sail Fund.

598
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,660
And the truth about the Qijing Pavilion
will come out.

599
00:28:48,111 --> 00:28:50,160
When it gets serious,
it might not take three days.

600
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,260
A few hours

601
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,420
could change everything.

602
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,740
Tu has been hiding for years.

603
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,377
Naturally, there are others who are
watching him other than us.

604
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,260
If He Youguang hears the news,

605
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,380
he won't sit and do nothing.

606
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,260
Remember.

607
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,900
Don't let Amita know

608
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,900
to avoid

609
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,820
unnecessary problems.

610
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,180
Yes, Master.

611
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:11,860
Please rest assured.

612
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,260
I'm a polite

613
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,620
and respectful man.

614
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,820
If not for the mission,

615
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,620
I wouldn't go

616
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,020
near Amita.

617
00:29:20,022 --> 00:29:21,340
I'll tell my brother-in-law

618
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,420
to be careful

619
00:29:23,044 --> 00:29:24,020
not to make mistakes

620
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:24,980
when they meet.

621
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,500
You can stay

622
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,180
and wait for my good news.

623
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,820
Anywhere there's light,

624
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,500
you look beautiful.

625
00:29:37,622 --> 00:29:39,200
Are you talking about He Youguang?

626
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,060
Forget it.

627
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,820
Ms. Amita.

628
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,900
Chief Scribe Zhao, what brings you here?

629
00:30:09,044 --> 00:30:10,622
Is there anything I can do for you?

630
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,260
Actually, I've seen it

631
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,900
all these years.

632
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:23,420
You've been on your own
in this Association,

633
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,100
dealing

634
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,660
with those profit-driven merchants,

635
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,500
running around

636
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,822
for Inspector He,
and earning him a lot of money.

637
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,100
But he treats you like a pawn.

638
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,540
Just thinking about it

639
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,660
makes my heart cold.

640
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:38,644
I'm only a low-ranking subordinate.

641
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,860
My words don't weigh much.

642
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,860
Even if I advise, it won't help.

643
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,140
Did you come today

644
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,460
only to say this?

645
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,866
No, I want to tell you

646
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,020
there's a chance

647
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,220
to change your fate.

648
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,980
I'm not doing this for Amita.

649
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,044
I'm doing it for myself.

650
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,460
You're confusing me.

651
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,660
(Amita found something from the past.)

652
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,380
(He Youguang once hijacked
a herbal medicine ship.)

653
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,900
If Haihu found out,

654
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,740
they'd kick him out

655
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,100
of the fleet.

656
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,420
Haihu ruled the seas

657
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,260
back then.

658
00:31:21,777 --> 00:31:23,820
That would be the end for him.

659
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,020
With his character,

660
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,340
it's only natural
he had killing intentions.

661
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,860
Li Shande

662
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,380
is looking for someone named Tu.

663
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,220
Tu used

664
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,380
to be a broker.

665
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,288
There was a strange story back then

666
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,140
during the hottest time
for Sea Sail Fund.

667
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,910
Someone

668
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,260
suddenly sold 2,000 shares.

669
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,700
Tu handled the deal.

670
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,260
Right after that,

671
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,020
your father died in a fire.

672
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,500
Now it seems

673
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,220
he might have known

674
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,020
something beforehand.

675
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,740
I mentioned Tu

676
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,622
to Inspector He today.

677
00:32:00,688 --> 00:32:01,580
He actually knows him.

678
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,900
Maybe

679
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:04,180
they made deals before.

680
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,500
Dayu Ridge's Tu?

681
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,300
Isn't he dead?

682
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,700
Do you also know Tu?

683
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,980
Tu was just a broker back then.

684
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,660
Why would He Youguang remember

685
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,220
a nobody's death?

686
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,820
He explained

687
00:32:21,288 --> 00:32:22,380
he remembered the brokers

688
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,060
who sold Sea Sail Fund shares back then.

689
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,340
I was one of the brokers back then.

690
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,420
I was also

691
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,190
the most famous one.

692
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,620
But he doesn't even recognize me.

693
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,060
There's something fishy here.

694
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,580
Are you saying

695
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,660
He Youguang and Tu are connected?

696
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,820
Exactly.

697
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,300
Now,

698
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,340
only Tu knows

699
00:32:43,888 --> 00:32:44,980
who sold those shares.

700
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,740
Keep a close eye on Li Shande.

701
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,300
Tu must not fall into his hands.

702
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,460
If necessary,

703
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,660
steal him back for me.

704
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:00,940
Chief Scribe Zhao,

705
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,740
why are you telling me this?

706
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,100
I know

707
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,100
you're wary of me.

708
00:33:13,955 --> 00:33:16,266
Staying by Inspector He's side
all these years,

709
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,900
I never opposed him.

710
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,900
But

711
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,700
I have

712
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,133
to earn my salary honestly.

713
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,540
I still couldn't figure out

714
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,500
how you could benefit from the situation

715
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,100
by telling Amita.

716
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,540
The last time I saw you,

717
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,980
you looked troubled.

718
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,140
I know you care about what happened

719
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,300
to your father back then.

720
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,980
Whoever finds Tu

721
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,060
can uncover

722
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,180
the truth.

723
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,020
If Amita finds Tu,

724
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,100
she'll have a fallout
with He Youguang.

725
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,422
Then the seat
of the Hu Merchants' Association chief

726
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,500
will be vacant.

727
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,260
I'm conflicted

728
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:54,780
about sharing this with you today.

729
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,420
I can use this chance

730
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,580
to elevate Xiao Yunchuan.

731
00:33:59,577 --> 00:34:01,220
When that happens, the Association

732
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,340
will be mine.

733
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,500
Maybe my conscience

734
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,580
got in the way.

735
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,620
So I can accept money

736
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,940
from Xiao Yunchuan openly.

737
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,020
I've said more than I should.

738
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,020
The rest is up to you.

739
00:34:19,088 --> 00:34:20,140
I shall take my leave now.

740
00:34:21,822 --> 00:34:24,180
(Tu went fishing
and expected to return in three days.)

741
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,020
(There should be no one)

742
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,700
(who can move faster than you at sea.)

743
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,900
Are you sure

744
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,022
your uncle returns today?

745
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,860
Has he ever been late before?

746
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,580
No.

747
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,660
Before he leaves,

748
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:01,300
he always prepares food
for the days he's going to be away.

749
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,980
He never comes home late.

750
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,540
I'll prepare some food for you.

751
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,500
My brother-in-law waited at Tu's hut

752
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,540
all day

753
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,780
but Tu didn't return.

754
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,740
Could something have happened?

755
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,780
Could Tu have been taken

756
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,860
by Inspector He's men?

757
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,780
Our informants say

758
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,340
Inspector He's men

759
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,620
are also near the hut.

760
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:30,970
Looks like

761
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:31,860
the secret's out.

762
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,780
Where could Tu have gone?

763
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,700
Ms. Amita.

764
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,860
When we caught Tu,

765
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,260
he was about to jump ship to escape.

766
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,940
Chief Scribe Zhao's words
are suspicious.

767
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,311
Don't trust him completely.

768
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,060
Tu,

769
00:36:51,911 --> 00:36:53,340
I am Haihu's daughter.

770
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,266
I am now
the Hu Merchants' Association's chief.

771
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,300
I swear on my life

772
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,700
that I won't harm you.

773
00:37:20,022 --> 00:37:21,540
I only need you to tell me the truth

774
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,060
about the Qijing Pavilion fire.

775
00:37:26,022 --> 00:37:27,100
Your eyes look exactly

776
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,800
like your father's.

777
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,980
I don't care who

778
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,020
or what you fear,

779
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,580
I will protect you

780
00:37:40,777 --> 00:37:42,355
as long as you tell the truth.

781
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,900
I can give you money

782
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,900
and help you escape Lingnan.

783
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:50,044
You'll never worry about money
for the rest of your life.

784
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,666
There's no truth to tell.

785
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,380
Tu,

786
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,740
just tell me.

787
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,100
Was my father's death an accident

788
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,540
or a conspiracy?

789
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,420
Well,

790
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,980
find a physician

791
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,622
to treat his wounds.

792
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,900
Get some food too.

793
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,610
Tu, you can name

794
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:39,900
your terms.

795
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,780
If I can meet them,

796
00:38:41,866 --> 00:38:43,377
I will agree with your terms.

797
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,300
We'll talk after you rest.

798
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,933
Don't let anyone bother him.

799
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,260
Ms. Amita,

800
00:39:01,311 --> 00:39:03,288
the Inspector's Office
is searching for Tu too.

801
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,700
Why don't we hand Tu over

802
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,660
to Inspector He

803
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,620
for questioning?

804
00:39:07,955 --> 00:39:09,940
Because I want an answer from him first.

805
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,140
Greetings, Inspector He.

806
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:36,980
Inspector He.

807
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,420
Take your time and tell me.

808
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,900
Inspector He,

809
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:53,940
I know

810
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,300
you've been looking for Tu.

811
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,620
Tu is now at the Association.

812
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,060
How did Tu end up

813
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,180
with Amita?

814
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,940
Ms. Amita seems

815
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,780
to have other plans.

816
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,022
So she wants
to interrogate him personally.

817
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,220
I think this should
first be reported to you

818
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,060
no matter what.

819
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,340
I came to tell you

820
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,260
that Ms. Amita might believe some rumors

821
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,140
and cause distrust
between you and her.

822
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,100
I'm also pleading to explain in person

823
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,780
and not blame Ms. Amita.

824
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,260
Inspector He,

825
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,580
I'm sure Ms. Amita doesn't...

826
00:41:02,155 --> 00:41:03,580
Looks like what's meant to happen...

827
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,300
will happen.

828
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,180
Master.

829
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,260
What did you find out?

830
00:41:32,288 --> 00:41:34,990
Word from the docks that pirates have
been active in the nearby waters

831
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,933
these past few days.

832
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,020
It's Amita.

833
00:41:41,355 --> 00:41:43,133
Someone clearly wanted to start a fight

834
00:41:43,155 --> 00:41:44,377
between Amita and He Youguang.

835
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,260
So they leaked the news to her early.

836
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:47,980
Amita...

837
00:41:49,088 --> 00:41:50,555
I'll get him back from her myself!

838
00:41:50,555 --> 00:41:51,300
(You must not.)

839
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,340
(Amita has eyes everywhere.)

840
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,955
It all happened so suddenly.

841
00:41:55,955 --> 00:41:58,000
He Youguang won't have time
to mobilize his forces.

842
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,210
He doesn't have
many men with him.

843
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:01,420
Luotuo, Jinjiao. Go to the association
to gather information.

844
00:42:01,422 --> 00:42:02,180
Yes, Master.

845
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,577
Keep Amita safe at all costs.

846
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,060
Amita.

847
00:42:22,688 --> 00:42:24,244
Godfather, what brings you here?

848
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,955
=The Litchi Road=

849
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,650
You really have

850
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,660
the makings of a chief.

851
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,740
What makes you value

852
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,460
Xiao Yunchuan that much?

853
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,100
Oh, Great Shaman.

854
00:42:56,222 --> 00:42:57,150
Does this look like

855
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,900
the terrain of Dayu Ridge?

856
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,780
I was a fool

857
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,500
to treat you like a sister.
