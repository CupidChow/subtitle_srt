=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,044 --> 00:01:41,460
(Assistant Minister of Entertainment)
Hurry up.

3
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,420
Hurry up.

4
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,660
Don't you know what time it is?

5
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,500
Check the time!

6
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,030
Close the gate.

7
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,110
Hurry up.

8
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,070
Hurry up.

9
00:01:53,300 --> 00:02:00,620
(Pingkang Ward)

10
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,780
Mr. Zheng.

11
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,750
Who are you drinking with today?

12
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,590
The Left Chancellor.

13
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,370
Greetings, my fellow gentlemen.

14
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,140
Here.

15
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,460
Mr. Zheng.

16
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,470
Mr. Zheng.

17
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:30,350
Put less spring onion.

18
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,349
Mr. Zheng, you are here.

19
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,044
The Left Chancellor
doesn't eat spring onion.

20
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,270
Mr. He.

21
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,310
Mr. He.

22
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,150
Let me.

23
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,140
Mr. He.

24
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,100
Mr. Zheng.

25
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,220
Mr. Zheng.

26
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,310
Mr. He.

27
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,310
I rather you step on me

28
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,190
instead of dirtying your boots.

29
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,030
If anything happens to you,

30
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,540
the Left Chancellor's heart will ache.

31
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,755
My heart will ache even more.

32
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:01,790
The Left Chancellor
is already waiting for you.

33
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,700
Slow down, Mr. He.

34
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,660
I hear

35
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,820
that your son is looking
for a good tutor

36
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,870
to teach him archery.

37
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,860
At the banquet today,

38
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,819
we have Officer Zhang
who is an expert in this.

39
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,244
After two rounds of drinking,

40
00:03:15,244 --> 00:03:16,500
I can introduce him to you later

41
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,540
to talk it out with him.

42
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,700
Thank you.

43
00:03:19,644 --> 00:03:21,422
- Thank you.
- See you later, Mr. He.

44
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,460
Take Mr. He to his seat.

45
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:24,980
Yes, Mr. Zheng.

46
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,620
Mr. Zhao.

47
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,100
Long time no see.

48
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,020
A precious thing from Liaodong.

49
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,620
I hear that you are in need
of this right now.

50
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,260
Thank you.

51
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,420
Thank you so much.

52
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,540
How do you know

53
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,533
that I have a new one?

54
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,980
We are both men.

55
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,460
There's no need to explain.

56
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,700
Hurry up. The Left Chancellor
is waiting for you.

57
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,700
See you later.

58
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,540
Staff Officer Nan.

59
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,020
Left Chancellor.

60
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,260
Can I have a drink with you?

61
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,740
(Left Chancellor)

62
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,780
You are a living treasure.

63
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,700
There are so many people to drink with.

64
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:13,980
Why do you want

65
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,100
to have a drink with me?

66
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,300
Have you forgotten?

67
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,900
My surname

68
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,340
is from the Zheng clan in Xingyang.

69
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,644
It's one of
the most prestigious surnames.

70
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,860
I have a noble status.

71
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,220
They don't deserve

72
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,140
to drink with me.

73
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,420
Zheng Ping'an.

74
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,780
Do you know

75
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,980
who he is?

76
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,780
He is

77
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,220
Deputy Director Lu Huan
from the Security Bureau.

78
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,140
He's an important and powerful man.

79
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,460
He supervises all the officials.

80
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,260
If you say something wrong
after getting drunk,

81
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,100
he may

82
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,540
arrest you.

83
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,780
Deputy Director Lu.

84
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,860
Deputy Director Lu.

85
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,660
Please forgive me.

86
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,020
I was just joking around

87
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,133
with the Left Chancellor.

88
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,100
Deputy Director Lu.

89
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,260
Please don't arrest me.

90
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,700
Forget it.

91
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,740
Thank you.

92
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,660
Look at you.

93
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,500
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

94
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:15,977
Today, the Left Chancellor is hosting
a banquet for his guests and friends.

95
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,580
Let me

96
00:05:18,088 --> 00:05:19,711
liven things up for everyone.

97
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,860
Very good.

98
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,740
Although he doesn't seem like it,

99
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,260
he really is from the bloodline
of the Zheng clan.

100
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,980
Unfortunately,

101
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,660
his father offended
the Right Chancellor.

102
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:45,220
So, the side of his family

103
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,300
got kicked out of their clan.

104
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,060
No wonder.

105
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,140
A real descendant of the Zheng clan

106
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,888
will never perform
the Sogdian Whirl dance

107
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,380
at a banquet.

108
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,310
Great.

109
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,060
Twirl!

110
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,900
Enough.

111
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,140
Enough.

112
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:06,420
You performed
the Sogdian Whirl dance quite well.

113
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,500
Here.

114
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,020
Let me reward you with a glass of wine.

115
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,780
Here.

116
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,890
Thank you, Left Chancellor.

117
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,540
Okay.

118
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,980
=Episode 4=

119
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:49,980
(Inspector's Office)

120
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,580
Has Inspector He woken up?

121
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,780
Mr. Li.

122
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:03,180
Why are you here so early today?

123
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,700
Inspector He hasn't returned yet.

124
00:07:05,688 --> 00:07:06,980
How about you wait for a while?

125
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,580
This one is pretty.

126
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,420
So pretty.

127
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,860
Inspector He.

128
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,820
Inspector He.

129
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,020
Very good!

130
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,180
Inspector He!

131
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,620
What is it?

132
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,940
The inner court

133
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,140
has indeed sent

134
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,140
an empty letter at the beginning

135
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,100
of February

136
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,380
to ask for fresh litchis.

137
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:35,866
The letter went through
the court assembly envoy in Lingnan.

138
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:37,155
They didn't dare to deliver it.

139
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,955
So, it was sent
to the Bureau of Agriculture.

140
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,740
If that's the case,

141
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,860
it's true that they
are transporting the litchis.

142
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,860
That envoy...

143
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,300
We have to help him.

144
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,140
No.

145
00:07:50,488 --> 00:07:52,333
We can't help him.
We have to stay out of this.

146
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,260
The fresh litchis

147
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,911
can't be transported to Chang'an, right?

148
00:07:54,911 --> 00:07:55,140
Yes.

149
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,200
The person who takes charge of this case
will be held responsible for it.

150
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,620
I think

151
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,060
the Litchi Envoy

152
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,100
also knows

153
00:08:02,244 --> 00:08:03,500
that he will fail this mission.

154
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,260
He came all the way here

155
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,540
to Lingnan

156
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,220
just to make money.

157
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,940
That's easy.

158
00:08:11,088 --> 00:08:12,180
Just give him some money

159
00:08:12,244 --> 00:08:13,100
and ask him to leave.

160
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,060
We can't give him money.

161
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,060
If we do,

162
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,580
we'll be dragged into this matter.

163
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,740
Listen to yourself.

164
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,780
You rejected all of my ideas.

165
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,260
Then what should we do?

166
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,100
We have to treat him well.

167
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,420
But we don't give him any actual help.

168
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,140
Okay?

169
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,488
We just need to stay out of this

170
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,740
and let him perish.

171
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,060
You are not the only smart one.

172
00:08:40,222 --> 00:08:41,800
That's exactly what I meant.

173
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,820
You are so wise.

174
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,700
I'm indeed wise.

175
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:50,140
But there's something else.

176
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,340
You are a coward.

177
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,980
Right?

178
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,380
Look how badly he scared you.

179
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,100
Do you think I would get myself

180
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,422
involved in this dire situation?

181
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,740
Am I foolish enough

182
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,580
to get involved?

183
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,780
I can't believe you.

184
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,900
Yes.

185
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,740
Come.

186
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,620
Tonight,

187
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:07,577
we'll eat Qingyuan chicken.

188
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:14,620
(Inspector's Office)

189
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,900
Envoy Li.

190
00:09:19,377 --> 00:09:21,020
The court assembly envoy in Lingnan

191
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,220
has confirmed your identity.

192
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,980
Since you've confirmed my identity,

193
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,380
about

194
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,740
this fresh litchi delivery...

195
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,580
Envoy Li.

196
00:09:34,777 --> 00:09:37,066
Do you know what Inspector He
is dealing with right now?

197
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,500
Lingnan

198
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,780
has sent a large amount of tribute

199
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,900
to Chang'an over the years.

200
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,420
Pearls.

201
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,380
Spices.

202
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,700
Exotic flowers and plants.

203
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,620
We shoulder a lot of responsibilities.

204
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,580
Delivering these goods consumes

205
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,660
a lot of money and food.

206
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,500
Even Inspector He has to lower himself

207
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,540
to ask for funding.

208
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,644
He left before dawn to do that.

209
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,700
You have to ask for funding too?

210
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,540
Of course.

211
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,540
There are not many

212
00:10:07,822 --> 00:10:09,266
like you who are considerate and

213
00:10:09,288 --> 00:10:11,020
understand the people's sufferings.

214
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,140
Others come here

215
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,580
to ask us for money and goods.

216
00:10:13,644 --> 00:10:15,110
It's not that we don't want to help.

217
00:10:15,111 --> 00:10:16,466
But we don't have the money either.

218
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,220
As Qu Yuan once said,

219
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,340
he sighed and silently teared up

220
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,020
over the hardships of the people.

221
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,300
Envoy Li, you are

222
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,580
the new Qu Yuan.

223
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,660
You are generous and considerate.

224
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,580
You refuse to add

225
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,100
to the people's burden.

226
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,740
I admire you.

227
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,580
I admire you.

228
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,420
No.

229
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,940
I'm new here in Lingnan.

230
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,540
I don't know the place well.

231
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,660
Please cooperate with me

232
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,980
regarding the purchase of fresh litchis.

233
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,820
Of course.

234
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:45,860
We will

235
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,300
do our best to help.

236
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,580
I

237
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,340
have prepared a handsome gift for you.

238
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,340
Not only it's valuable,

239
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,100
but it's also one-of-a-kind.

240
00:10:58,577 --> 00:10:59,980
Thank you, Chief Scribe Zhao.

241
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,980
You should thank Inspector He.

242
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,380
Thank you, Inspector He.

243
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,020
This is

244
00:11:08,088 --> 00:11:10,266
(Lingnan Five Prefectures Pass)
the Inspector's pass.

245
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,900
With this,

246
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,100
you can visit anywhere

247
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,380
in Lingnan.

248
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,820
No one will stop you.

249
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,060
Don't you think this is valuable
and precious?

250
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,100
We will help you

251
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,660
as best as we can

252
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,260
to our abilities.

253
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,180
Yes.

254
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,580
Inspector He

255
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,340
personally

256
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,140
wrote a signage for you.

257
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,700
With this,

258
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,700
you can get to work without worries.

259
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,380
As you can see,

260
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,300
the Inspector's Office
is tight on money.

261
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,140
You'll have to find

262
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,220
a public space

263
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,220
to rent by yourself.

264
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,500
(Litchi Bureau)

265
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,340
Qilang.

266
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,340
Mr. Li is back.

267
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,340
Mr. Li.

268
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,300
My dear brother-in-law.

269
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,700
Come. Let's eat.

270
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,311
Are you going to hang up this signage?

271
00:12:22,155 --> 00:12:23,533
My dear brother-in-law.

272
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,100
Move away.

273
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:26,733
I'm scared of you.

274
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:27,500
No.

275
00:12:27,688 --> 00:12:28,900
My dear brother-in-law,

276
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,180
I was

277
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,140
too mean last night.

278
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,333
You can't take it to heart.

279
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,549
When your sister was alive,
you never called me that.

280
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,060
I'm scared that my life will be
cut short if you call me that now.

281
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:38,420
No.

282
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,900
My dear brother-in-law.

283
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,088
I had to go to the street three times
to get the lotus glutinous rice chicken,

284
00:12:43,088 --> 00:12:43,950
fish fillet porridge,

285
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,740
and big prawns.

286
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,555
I'm not going to eat with you.

287
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,020
I'm the plague.

288
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,700
Everyone who runs into me

289
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:51,900
will become unfortunate.

290
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,060
You've cut your ties with me.

291
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,740
Let go of me.

292
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,580
Shande.

293
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,180
Not all ties are cut off.

294
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,900
Shande.

295
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,740
I'm still Xiu'er's uncle, right?

296
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:02,420
Just now, you mentioned my sister.

297
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,700
Let's have a meal together, okay?

298
00:13:06,044 --> 00:13:07,260
Don't make me beg you.

299
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,180
I'm a man with pride.

300
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,955
Eat the glutinous rice
chicken while it's hot.

301
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:13,740
Let's go.

302
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,500
Shande.

303
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,580
If you want money,

304
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,140
you need to put your pride away

305
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,460
and stick to them

306
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,500
like mud

307
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,780
until they can't get rid of you.

308
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,900
Look at you now.

309
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,580
That cunning fox

310
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,420
won't give you a dime.

311
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,380
What did he say?

312
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,555
He said he gave you a pass.

313
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:34,780
Do you know what that means?

314
00:13:35,244 --> 00:13:36,780
It means that you should get lost

315
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,820
and stop bothering him.

316
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,700
What else did he say?

317
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,980
"In the future..."

318
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,100
- "If it's within our abilities..."
- We'll help you.

319
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,180
What does that mean?

320
00:13:50,577 --> 00:13:53,200
It means that he won't help you
if he doesn't want to.

321
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,580
What can I do now?

322
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,260
What can you do?

323
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,580
Shande.

324
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,780
You are a great mathematician.

325
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,380
Even 10 of me is no match for you.

326
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,220
But you have

327
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,700
to learn from me

328
00:14:08,977 --> 00:14:10,555
when it comes to asking for favors.

329
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,180
Really?

330
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,580
I can't get my face to be

331
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,500
as thick as yours.

332
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,780
Let's get back to business.

333
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,780
Shande.

334
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,140
I can help you

335
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,860
get some funding.

336
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,580
But

337
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,140
I, myself,

338
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,060
am in a pinch now.

339
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,220
If you can help me

340
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,460
overcome this obstacle,

341
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,420
in the future,

342
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,020
no matter how far,

343
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,980
if we ever need help,

344
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,060
we can always count on each other.

345
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,820
Isn't that beautiful?

346
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,380
I understand now.

347
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,780
Now,

348
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:56,620
a big pit has appeared

349
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,460
on your big road.

350
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,780
So, you need to use my bridge

351
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,620
to cross it.

352
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,700
See?

353
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,060
You are a smart man.

354
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:05,100
You understand right away.

355
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,900
Well.

356
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,140
I need to know

357
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,780
what it is.

358
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,860
Although your surname is Ma now,

359
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,540
I'm still your ex-brother-in-law.

360
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,088
If there's anything
I can help you with, I'll do my best.

361
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:21,422
You are using
what I taught you against me.

362
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:23,911
You are just saying pretty words

363
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,180
to pacify me.

364
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,300
I don't want to hear those words.

365
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,500
Are you the one

366
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,380
who dug this pit?

367
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,860
How is that possible?

368
00:15:34,022 --> 00:15:35,900
Did you tell anyone
about Pan Bao's death?

369
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,460
Did someone find out

370
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,488
that Ma Guiyun didn't know
about Pan Bao's death?

371
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:42,540
So, who is Ma Guiyun?

372
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,900
Don't ask.

373
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:47,820
Knowing too much is not good for you.

374
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,380
No. If you say that,

375
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,660
I'm more curious to know now.

376
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,100
I'm already

377
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,180
at my lowest point.

378
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,020
How much worse

379
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,100
can it get?

380
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:57,900
Are you sure you want to know?

381
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,300
Yes.

382
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,540
Then I'll tell you the truth.

383
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,060
Qilang.

384
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,180
Gou'er.

385
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,140
Don't stop me.

386
00:16:10,488 --> 00:16:11,660
The person closest to me

387
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,900
in this world

388
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,460
is Xiu'er,

389
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,020
right?

390
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,580
The second person closest to me

391
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,140
is Gou'er.

392
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:27,300
You are one of the closest people
to me too.

393
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,140
Right?

394
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,577
Since you want to know the truth,

395
00:16:31,422 --> 00:16:32,500
I'll tell you the truth.

396
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,980
Even though those who know
who Ma Guiyun is

397
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,740
will die.

398
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,500
He is willing to be
in the same boat as us.

399
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,380
No.

400
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,620
Don't scare me.

401
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,100
I'm going to die anyway.

402
00:16:48,622 --> 00:16:49,888
I'm not afraid of death.

403
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,860
I fear no death.

404
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,380
I won't get scared by death.

405
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,100
Shande.

406
00:16:57,111 --> 00:16:58,620
If you don't know who Ma Guiyun is,

407
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:00,400
you can live for another four months.

408
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:02,220
But once you know who Ma Guiyun is,

409
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,820
you can only live eight hours at most.

410
00:17:04,844 --> 00:17:06,688
But you are still willing
to listen to me.

411
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,140
You are the best brother-in-law.

412
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,340
Ma Guiyun is...

413
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,460
No. Well...

414
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,220
Ma Guiyun is...

415
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,060
No. Well...

416
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,060
Ma Guiyun...

417
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,180
I'm not

418
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,660
that curious.

419
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,940
Then I'll tell you the answer

420
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,180
when you are curious.

421
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,780
Fine.

422
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,580
Tell me.

423
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,420
How

424
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,540
can I help you?

425
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,740
To Zhao Xinmin,

426
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,420
I don't know about Pan Bao's death.

427
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,260
You have to prove

428
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,180
that I'm not lying.

429
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,580
Why are you hesitating?

430
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,660
Shande...

431
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,900
We are in the same boat

432
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,380
right now.

433
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,940
It's not just me.

434
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,780
There are also Xiu'er

435
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,460
and Gou'er.

436
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,980
We should row the boat together

437
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,300
to carve a path out for both of us.

438
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,140
Understand?

439
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,500
You have to help me.

440
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:35,300
Who is closer to you? Me or Gou'er?

441
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:38,980
Pick up

442
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,260
those leaves.

443
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,980
(Inspector's Office)

444
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,820
Over here.

445
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,820
Chief Scribe Zhao.

446
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,260
I came to pass on the message
for Master Konglang.

447
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,860
What is it?

448
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,580
Lend me your ear.

449
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,300
Inspector He.

450
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,500
We have the answer.

451
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,260
Ma Guiyun is indeed

452
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,444
the Right Chancellor's envoy.

453
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,620
And he

454
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,380
came to Lingnan from Chang'an.

455
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,380
If that's the case,

456
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,180
there's nothing wrong with Ma Guiyun.

457
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:35,444
Get me a piece of paper and a brush.

458
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,740
I'll write a letter for him

459
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,380
and

460
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,220
take back

461
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,060
my military tally.

462
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:45,060
We shouldn't write a letter
of allegiance to him so quickly.

463
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,700
We have confirmed his identity.

464
00:19:47,777 --> 00:19:49,666
But it's strange of him
to hide Pan Bao's death

465
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,460
from us.

466
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,500
Are you saying

467
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,380
that there's still

468
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,888
something wrong with Ma Guiyun?

469
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,780
Then we can just arrest him.

470
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,540
It's just a guess right now.

471
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,300
Inspector He, Ma Guiyun has sent someone

472
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,810
to deliver an invitation letter to you.

473
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,180
Ma Guiyun is leaving.

474
00:20:17,377 --> 00:20:18,980
He'll hold a farewell banquet tonight.

475
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,780
Zhao.

476
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,180
You are always

477
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,260
so suspicious of everything.

478
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,100
What's the point?

479
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,540
I haven't gotten my military tally yet.

480
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,380
And now he's leaving.

481
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,620
Just do as I say.

482
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,780
You go over there tonight.

483
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,020
Walk straight in and say nothing.

484
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,200
Just chop off one of his hands.

485
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,350
Then ask if he'll hand it over.

486
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,580
If he refuses, take the other hand!

487
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,180
Still nothing?

488
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,020
Then cut off a foot.

489
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,220
Whichever one you want.

490
00:20:38,377 --> 00:20:39,800
I don't believe he'll keep saying no!

491
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,340
Let's not be so violent.

492
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,580
Who's being violent?

493
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,060
I said stay calm.

494
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,222
I'll go to the banquet tonight.

495
00:20:46,555 --> 00:20:47,740
I'll make sure he stays.

496
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,180
I arranged this banquet

497
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,155
to say goodbye to you.

498
00:20:53,866 --> 00:20:55,780
I even specially invited
Envoy Li to join us.

499
00:20:57,266 --> 00:20:58,380
You mean the Litchi Envoy?

500
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,540
That's right.

501
00:20:59,977 --> 00:21:01,377
Though I didn't get a chance

502
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,644
to meet Inspector He,

503
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,060
I know very well how much he cares
for the Right Chancellor.

504
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,340
But still,

505
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,460
there's one small thing

506
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,620
I want to remind you about.

507
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,740
Alright.

508
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,700
Please go ahead.

509
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,860
I'm all ears.

510
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,740
This Envoy Li

511
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,140
might look simple and honest,

512
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,460
but he's very deep.

513
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,620
As far as I know, he rarely speaks.

514
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,020
But when he does,

515
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,180
it's worth paying close attention.

516
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,700
Mr. Zhao.

517
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,900
Mr. Li.

518
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,580
Sorry I'm late.

519
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,020
I hope I didn't keep you waiting.

520
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,100
Not at all.

521
00:21:44,088 --> 00:21:45,380
We were just waiting to start.

522
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,220
Come, take your seat.

523
00:21:47,444 --> 00:21:48,340
Chief Scribe Zhao.

524
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,180
I'll sit here then.

525
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,060
Right, here.

526
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,940
You're from Chang'an.

527
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,780
Sit here.

528
00:21:55,244 --> 00:21:55,940
That's my drink.

529
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,580
Then scoot over a bit.

530
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,460
I'll sit here.

531
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,420
I'm sitting here.

532
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,580
Here.

533
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,500
Chief Scribe Zhao.

534
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,180
Sit right here.

535
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,500
How much have you had to drink?

536
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,220
Come on, sit.

537
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,700
I'm getting drunk.

538
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,644
Start serving the dishes.

539
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,860
Yes.

540
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,500
Envoy Li,

541
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,580
we meet again.

542
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,460
We're practically family now.

543
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,060
You can just ask me

544
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,300
about that procurement

545
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,620
if you don't understand something.

546
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,220
Just ask me.

547
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,060
All right.

548
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,220
I'm glad you feel that way.

549
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,020
Like family.

550
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,980
Since you mentioned it,

551
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,140
I do have something to ask.

552
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,740
Litchis rots quickly.

553
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,180
They go bad three days after picking.

554
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,620
So, why is His Majesty

555
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,780
so fixated on litchis

556
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,220
from Lingnan?

557
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,940
His Majesty

558
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,580
has his reasons.

559
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:53,133
It's not our place to speculate.

560
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,333
I dare not guess at all.

561
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,460
I think I figured it out.

562
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,460
It's because His Majesty cares
about Lingnan.

563
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,180
Yes.

564
00:23:05,222 --> 00:23:06,500
He cares about Lingnan.

565
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,180
So,

566
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,020
has Inspector He returned yet?

567
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,860
Not yet.

568
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,740
Envoy Li was curious about that.

569
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,020
I am curious about one thing too.

570
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,740
I'm curious

571
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,180
how exactly

572
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,540
did Pan Bao die?

573
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,220
Well,

574
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,540
Pan Bao drowned

575
00:23:33,777 --> 00:23:34,780
in Leyou Garden.

576
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,980
I mentioned it when I came.

577
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,500
Chief Scribe Zhao,

578
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,700
do you really think

579
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,540
I can't get these litchis back

580
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,380
to Chang'an?

581
00:23:42,866 --> 00:23:43,540
Oh, not at all.

582
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,780
Someone drowned in Leyou Garden

583
00:23:44,977 --> 00:23:46,180
is not a trivial matter.

584
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,300
How come I didn't hear a word about it?

585
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,060
You don't believe I can get
the litchis to Chang'an, right?

586
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:51,980
Of course, I do.

587
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,460
If you do,

588
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,900
shouldn't you be doing your part?

589
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,340
Why did you hide it?

590
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,460
Well, here's what happened

591
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,300
to Pan Bao.

592
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,420
There was

593
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,580
an old peony in Leyou Garden.

594
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,940
It was His Majesty's favorite.

595
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,180
The Right Chancellor's men

596
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,340
accidentally broke it.

597
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,860
Everyone in Leyou Garden

598
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,620
was silenced.

599
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,980
No one dared speak

600
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,660
about what really happened that day.

601
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,340
And

602
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,820
Pan Bao drowned

603
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,660
that very day.

604
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,660
So that's the truth.

605
00:24:31,022 --> 00:24:32,780
Since no one is supposed
to talk about it,

606
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,540
how come

607
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,020
you dare

608
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,500
to tell us all this now?

609
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,460
Well, His Majesty assigned me

610
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,511
a task, right?

611
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,420
I have nothing to fear.

612
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,900
And

613
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,860
I'll make it clear.

614
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,220
I came to Lingnan with a task.

615
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,660
Either I complete it,

616
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,220
or I die trying.

617
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,540
Then let's drink

618
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,380
to your success, Envoy Li!

619
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,220
To success!

620
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:00,940
Come.

621
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,140
Let's drink.

622
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,100
Let's raise our cup.

623
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,220
And drink!

624
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,140
There's a saying,

625
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,940
true friends feel close

626
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,380
no matter how far apart they are.

627
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,580
Xinmin.

628
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,500
I'm leaving tomorrow.

629
00:25:13,644 --> 00:25:15,060
Please take good care of my friend

630
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,940
once I'm gone.

631
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,740
Guiyun, hold on.

632
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,580
I heard you were planning

633
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,420
to leave today.

634
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,260
So I sent a message

635
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,180
to Inspector He.

636
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,900
He's already on his way back.

637
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,980
So please...

638
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,420
Please

639
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,420
stay one more day.

640
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,860
He'll arrive in Lingnan tomorrow?

641
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,260
In that case,

642
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:43,220
I'll stay one more day.

643
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,580
The charm of Lingnan.

644
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,700
Let's drink!

645
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,700
Life can't be more comfortable
than this!

646
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,900
Drink up, Envoy Li.

647
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,740
Let's drink.

648
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,540
Come on.

649
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,740
Everyone, fill your cups.

650
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,980
Fill them up!

651
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,980
Let the Southern charm dance into life!

652
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,420
(Inspector's Office)

653
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,900
By order of the Inspector He,

654
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,780
summon Envoy Ma Guiyun from Chang'an

655
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,540
for an audience.

656
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:15,900
Summon Envoy Ma Guiyun from Chang'an

657
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,340
for an audience!

658
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,940
No need for formalities.

659
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,066
Thank you, Inspector He.

660
00:27:03,644 --> 00:27:06,180
I've heard of your strength
and prowess for a long time.

661
00:27:06,577 --> 00:27:07,955
Now that I've met you in person,

662
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,780
the rumors don't do you justice.

663
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,020
Is that so?

664
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,460
You're even more formidable

665
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,700
than the stories say.

666
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,780
Inspector He,

667
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,380
I've been here for days

668
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,820
but you've been too busy

669
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,140
to see me.

670
00:27:28,288 --> 00:27:29,300
I was starting to think

671
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,820
you didn't want
this military tally anymore.

672
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:34,980
My apologies.

673
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,700
I've been occupied

674
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,620
by official matters.

675
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,780
How about this?

676
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,500
I'll host a banquet

677
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,060
as an apology.

678
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,180
That's not necessary.

679
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,420
Inspector He,

680
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,260
I'm sure

681
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,140
you brought

682
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,380
what I came for.

683
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,500
Shall we make

684
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,260
the exchange?

685
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,660
Guiyun,

686
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,860
you know

687
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,220
how much I need

688
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,580
that military tally.

689
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,100
As much as I want that military tally,

690
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,940
I...

691
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,660
can't take it now.

692
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,220
Why not?

693
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,100
The Left Chancellor
has set his eyes on me.

694
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:25,940
I...

695
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,460
don't follow.

696
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,620
Listen.

697
00:28:28,911 --> 00:28:30,580
A pawn of the Left Chancellor claimed

698
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,980
to work for the Right Chancellor

699
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,220
and killed Pan Bao.

700
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,820
Guiyun,

701
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,500
don't tell me you don't know

702
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,740
who I'm talking about.

703
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,860
When did you figure it out?

704
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,300
Yesterday.

705
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,580
Something you said

706
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
made me figure it all out.

707
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,380
What did I say?

708
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,380
You told me to pay close attention

709
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,020
to what the Litchi Envoy said.

710
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,940
He mentioned litchis rot fast,

711
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,740
three days after being picked.

712
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,900
He was insinuating something.

713
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,820
I want to emphasize
that transporting litchis is hard.

714
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,980
I have to let them know

715
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,340
that I understand the nature of litchis.

716
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,860
He's clearly saying

717
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,420
we are rotting with corruption

718
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,340
in Lingnan

719
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,620
because His Majesty is too far away.

720
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,311
That's quite the interpretation...

721
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,060
What he said next was even deeper.

722
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,380
He mentioned

723
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,740
His Majesty's fixation

724
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,300
on Lingnan's litchis...

725
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,700
He said His Majesty cares about Lingnan.

726
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,220
A mere Litchi Envoy

727
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,780
dares to use His Majesty to pressure me.

728
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,644
His message was clear.

729
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,511
Colluding with Right Chancellor
is useless

730
00:29:59,511 --> 00:30:01,510
because His Majesty is above him.

731
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,700
And he said

732
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:03,940
he would

733
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,340
either complete it

734
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,540
or die trying.

735
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,980
That is very well said.

736
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,260
It shows

737
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,700
he has come to Lingnan prepared to die.

738
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,060
He's trying

739
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,860
to test

740
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,420
our loyalty

741
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,620
with his own life.

742
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,420
Well, what I said

743
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,860
was both a threat and a plea.

744
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,540
I need to stress

745
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,820
that I'm fully committed now.

746
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,060
There's no turning back,

747
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,380
and failure isn't an option.

748
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,740
Guiyun,

749
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,780
did you hear that?

750
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,540
He made his point without saying much.

751
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,820
We can't tell

752
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,300
what this man is thinking.

753
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,500
After hearing what he said yesterday,

754
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,820
I broke out

755
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,300
in a cold sweat.

756
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,140
You've got Zhao Xinmin completely

757
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,060
in the palm of your hand.

758
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,860
That was brilliant.

759
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:57,900
Then

760
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,780
who do you think

761
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,060
the Left Chancellor had sent?

762
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,580
It's Li Shande.

763
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,340
Exactly.

764
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,980
We can't base everything

765
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,940
on wordplay

766
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,460
on something this important, right?

767
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,180
Guiyun,

768
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,740
let me ask you this.

769
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,780
Who

770
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,940
in all of Chang'an

771
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,940
would least want me

772
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,220
to get that military tally?

773
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:33,180
Obviously, the Left Chancellor.

774
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,660
If he found out

775
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,660
I sent someone to Chang'an

776
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,860
to retrieve the military tally,
what he would do?

777
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,300
Kill them.

778
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,700
Which is why Pan Bao died.

779
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,260
The Left Chancellor had him killed.

780
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,220
Pan Bao must have leaked

781
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,500
that the Right Chancellor's man
was headed to Lingnan for the exchange.

782
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,540
And just as you showed up,

783
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,466
this Litchi Envoy appears
out of nowhere.

784
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,580
So I'm certain
the Litchi Envoy is working

785
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,020
for the Left Chancellor.

786
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,860
Brilliant deduction!

787
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,860
Guiyun,

788
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,220
you risked your life coming here
to warn us

789
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,380
about Li Shande's words.

790
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,700
You told us to really listen
and to read between the lines.

791
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,769
You even hinted there was someone
above him pulling the strings.

792
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,420
Chief Scribe Zhao and I spent the whole
night figuring out what he said.

793
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,533
Only then did we realize

794
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,620
just how massive a game

795
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,940
the Left Chancellor is playing.

796
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,460
Guiyun,

797
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,100
I won't forget

798
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,100
what you've done for us.

799
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,700
Well, it's all because
of your brilliant minds.

800
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:31,500
Your insight is truly remarkable.

801
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,340
But

802
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,660
Guiyun,

803
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,540
I also understand

804
00:32:39,844 --> 00:32:41,288
you didn't come here for nothing.

805
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,860
You can only return

806
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,060
to Chang'an
with my letter of allegiance.

807
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,911
Or else you won't be able
to explain yourself.

808
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,140
But

809
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,780
if Li Shande is still here

810
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,180
and we go ahead

811
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,500
with the exchange,

812
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,460
that would be a huge risk.

813
00:32:57,066 --> 00:32:58,900
Inspector He, you're overthinking it.

814
00:32:59,422 --> 00:33:00,500
The time now is perfect.

815
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,820
There's no one else here.

816
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,220
I hand you the military tally

817
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,100
and you give me the letter.

818
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,700
That's it.

819
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,100
It's just that simple.

820
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,660
That won't work.

821
00:33:11,933 --> 00:33:14,100
If I have
the Right Chancellor's military tally,

822
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,380
I intend to use it.

823
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,460
But with Li Shande still around,

824
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,460
how could I use it?

825
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,300
Exactly.

826
00:33:19,933 --> 00:33:20,980
That's why I've thought

827
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,940
of a better way.

828
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,060
We kill him.

829
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,340
Once he's dead,

830
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,500
we make the exchange.

831
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,580
What do you say?

832
00:33:31,733 --> 00:33:33,180
Li Shande is an envoy appointed

833
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,300
by His Majesty himself.

834
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,300
Killing him would be reckless,

835
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,300
Inspector He.

836
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,300
The Left Chancellor is meticulous.

837
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:44,900
If the Left Chancellor

838
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,820
truly sent Li Shande,

839
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,700
he wouldn't send

840
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,900
only one person here.

841
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,300
Go on.

842
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,660
If you kill him,

843
00:33:57,733 --> 00:33:59,644
not only would it not solve
your problem,

844
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,940
but would also alert the enemy.

845
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,420
If one of his spies catches wind of it,

846
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,140
it could ruin everything for you.

847
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,900
Then what do you think

848
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:15,940
we should do?

849
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,740
The best plan

850
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,100
is to drive Li Shande

851
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,900
out of Lingnan.

852
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,340
What if he refuses to leave?

853
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,500
I know him enough.

854
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,300
He trusts me more

855
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,300
than he trusts any of you.

856
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,340
I'll find a way

857
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,980
to drive him out.

858
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,340
You really are

859
00:35:02,222 --> 00:35:03,700
the Right Chancellor's man.

860
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,380
Clever,

861
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,900
thorough,

862
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,380
and always thinking
about the bigger picture.

863
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,180
Then it's settled.

864
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,340
If you can drive

865
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,820
Li Shande out,

866
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,860
we'll make the trade immediately.

867
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,620
But if you fail,

868
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,500
I'll kill him myself.

869
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,260
Why?

870
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,460
Why!

871
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,260
How did things

872
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,580
end up like this?

873
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,860
Such hidden talents those two are.

874
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,860
Call them smart?

875
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,420
They plot and scheme all day.

876
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,860
Call them foolish?

877
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,620
They can weave a story

878
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,180
out of pure speculation.

879
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,260
Qilang,

880
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,620
Mr. Li is still waiting at the inn

881
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,266
for the Inspector's Office to pay up.

882
00:36:12,444 --> 00:36:13,580
How do we explain ourselves

883
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,060
to him?

884
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,740
Explain to him?

885
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,540
I don't owe him any explanation.

886
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,020
Still,

887
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,340
it's not all his fault.

888
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,700
He said

889
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,100
his colleague tricked him

890
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,020
and made it sound like an easy job.

891
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,540
Then

892
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,900
why did others trick him?

893
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,740
Why is he the one who fell for it?

894
00:36:32,244 --> 00:36:33,300
He's always being used

895
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,700
by others.

896
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:35,860
Then he tries to use me.

897
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:39,940
What is so funny?

898
00:36:40,377 --> 00:36:41,500
Do you think I'm a fool?

899
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,620
No, not at all.

900
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,700
I was just thinking about Xiu'er.

901
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,620
I'm her uncle

902
00:36:47,355 --> 00:36:48,900
so I won't argue with him for her sake.

903
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,500
Yes, of course.

904
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,420
It is your pure heart

905
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,500
and kindness

906
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,711
that you forgive Mr. Li.

907
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,020
But what do we do now?

908
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,940
Mr. Li just got here.

909
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,700
He's not going to leave Lingnan.

910
00:36:59,866 --> 00:37:01,180
He has to leave no matter what.

911
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,900
Once he sees

912
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,740
the situation clearly,

913
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,500
he'll have to listen to me.

914
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,100
Li Shande.

915
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,380
I'm not leaving.

916
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:15,900
He Youguang

917
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,820
was going to pay.

918
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,777
Why would I leave now?

919
00:37:18,066 --> 00:37:19,380
We run into a bit of a conflict

920
00:37:19,422 --> 00:37:20,600
in our mission right now.

921
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,580
If there's some sort of conflict,

922
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,400
why should I be the one listening
to you?

923
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,700
If you stay,

924
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,540
I could die.

925
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,540
You could die?

926
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,460
You said the same thing

927
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,980
before you met Zhao Xinmin.

928
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,755
Why is it always life and death
with you?

929
00:37:37,977 --> 00:37:38,980
My dear brother-in-law.

930
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,300
Don't call me that.

931
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:42,140
You're not part
of the Zheng family anymore.

932
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,380
Logically speaking,

933
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,220
we're not family.

934
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,060
I'll just be frank.

935
00:37:47,444 --> 00:37:48,844
I met He Youguang today.

936
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,460
He didn't do what he was supposed to do.

937
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,540
He is also not going

938
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,940
to pay you.

939
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,700
Why?

940
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,860
I thought I was smarter than them.

941
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,460
But they were smarter.

942
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,300
But

943
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,180
you said

944
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,740
last night we made

945
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,580
the perfect team.

946
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,660
You said Zhao Xinmin

947
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,780
was in the palm

948
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,740
of my hand.

949
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,580
You also said...

950
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,700
They must pay no matter what.

951
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,940
They have to pay.

952
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,044
I'll go and see them myself.

953
00:38:19,555 --> 00:38:20,740
There's no point in going.

954
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,340
You're not getting that money.

955
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:23,860
Why...

956
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,660
Fine.

957
00:38:27,777 --> 00:38:28,940
I'll help you one more time.

958
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,380
But promise me that you'll
head back to Chang'an

959
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,340
once you get the money.

960
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,220
But if I've got the money,

961
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,660
why leave so soon?

962
00:38:38,755 --> 00:38:40,333
Wouldn't it be better to stay longer

963
00:38:40,355 --> 00:38:41,488
and make more for Xiu'er?

964
00:38:42,266 --> 00:38:44,600
Do you know what
"better safe than sorry" means?

965
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,020
Take the money and leave.

966
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,140
That's the smart move.

967
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,180
If something goes wrong,

968
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,580
I'm worried

969
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,860
Xiu'er might never

970
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,700
see you again.

971
00:38:55,088 --> 00:38:56,340
Once you receive the money,

972
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,220
go home

973
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,580
and spend time with Xiu'er.

974
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:01,060
Then I can finish my business here
without worries.

975
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,900
After I get it done,

976
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,540
I'll head home

977
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,860
and take care of her too.

978
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,380
(Chang'an)

979
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,140
(Xiu'er,)

980
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,580
(I made a new friend yesterday.)

981
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,340
(I call him Mr. Mule.)

982
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,020
(The fine horse)

983
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,700
(that left Chang'an with me)

984
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:38,100
(couldn't keep up with my pace.)

985
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,060
(It just stopped and refused to go on.)

986
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,980
(So at the market,)

987
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,060
(I chose this mule from Huaixi.)

988
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:53,020
(I didn't expect him to be so steady)

989
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,020
(and strong.)

990
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,540
(He even hummed as he trotted.)

991
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,180
(It was as if the journey)

992
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,820
(to Lingnan meant nothing to him.)

993
00:40:07,022 --> 00:40:08,479
(When the officials here heard)

994
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,500
(that I was assigned)

995
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,540
(by His Majesty,)

996
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,180
(they let me stay)

997
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,500
(at the best inn.)

998
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,140
(The walls are covered in vines)

999
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,700
(and there are coconut trees
by the roof.)

1000
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,060
(Hired to Write)

1001
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,660
(As I write this,
I'm tasting fresh litchis)

1002
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,220
(and there's a piece)

1003
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,420
(of peeled sugarcane beside me.)

1004
00:40:31,066 --> 00:40:32,780
(Inspector's Office)
(Even in Chang'an,)

1005
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,420
(not even His Majesty gets)

1006
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,340
(this kind of treatment.)

1007
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,140
(Once I finish the task,)

1008
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:43,380
(I'll be back soon to see you.)

1009
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,340
(I miss you.)

1010
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,660
(I dream of you every night.)

1011
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,860
(Hongni Embroidery)

1012
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,780
(Xiu'er.)

1013
00:40:59,155 --> 00:41:00,822
(Ever since your father left Chang'an,)

1014
00:41:00,844 --> 00:41:03,740
(his letters haven't stopped.)

1015
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,940
(That shows)

1016
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,220
(he's been thinking of you.)

1017
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,140
(I wonder if he has run into
any trouble in Lingnan)

1018
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,900
(and if he managed to solve it.)

1019
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,980
(He's there on an assignment
from His Majesty.)

1020
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,260
(So once he arrived in Lingnan,)

1021
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,580
(he'd have everyone's support.)

1022
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,620
(Nothing could stop him.)

1023
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,740
(I know this task)

1024
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,940
must be very difficult.

1025
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,300
Back when Mother was gravely ill...

1026
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,340
(Father didn't want us to worry.)

1027
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,260
(So he kept Mother's illness from us.)

1028
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,180
(He forced himself to act cheerful,)

1029
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,460
(smiling even more than usual.)

1030
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,340
Only after she passed

1031
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,380
did he finally stop smiling

1032
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:04,980
and cry.

1033
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,460
(Before he left this time,)

1034
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,660
(I saw that same smile on his face.)

1035
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,700
That's how I knew

1036
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:21,020
he must be facing
something harder than ever before.

1037
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,100
(But since he doesn't want me to know,)

1038
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,780
(I'll pretend I don't.)

1039
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,300
I can't let him worry

1040
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,020
about his duties

1041
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,900
and still have to worry about me.

=The Litchi Road=

1043
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,622
There's no chance of winning.

1044
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,780
The road to Chang'an is long.

1045
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,900
Who knows when we'll meet again.

1046
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,300
Take care.

1047
00:43:04,066 --> 00:43:05,333
- See you.
- See you.
