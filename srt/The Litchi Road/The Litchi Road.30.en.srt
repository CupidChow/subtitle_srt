greed

4
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,190
is not a sin.

5
00:02:13,155 --> 00:02:14,470
Incompetence is.

to buy up every last candle

the price of candles in Chang'an

20
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,680

If anyone dares sell below market price,

25
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,133
they'll regret it.

more than four times the usual rate.

31
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,520
Even Pingkang Ward,
where the candles burn all night long,

32
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,733
has switched to oil lamps.

33
00:03:16,755 --> 00:03:19,030
If we don't buy in soon,
the price will keep climbing.

34
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:22,355
Maybe you should run. There's no way
for you to survive in Chang'an anymore.

The greater the chaos,
the more opportunities arise.

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,710
Opportunities?

38
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,190
Attendant Yu,

39
00:03:34,288 --> 00:03:35,910
are you here to blame someone else

40
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:38,910
or to make excuses?

41
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,470
Neither.

42
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,910
I've been contemplating
the candle procurement matter

43
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,870
at length.

44
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,400
What if

45
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,355
we could buy them all without spending

46
00:04:00,377 --> 00:04:02,266
a coin from the imperial treasury?

47
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,080
I'd like to ask

48
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,840
you for one favor.

49
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,960
Go on.

50
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:14,280
I'd like to borrow some money from you.

51
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,600
On what terms?

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,480
This is no small sum.

53
00:04:45,822 --> 00:04:48,310
Double interest in 20 days?

54
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,711
What collateral do you offer?

55
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,950
My life.

56
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,040
As long as your seal

57
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,310
is on the contract,

58
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,000
the candle delivery date

59
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,466
shall be the loan's repayment deadline.

60
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,870
Interesting.

61
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:07,911
This just keeps
getting more interesting.

62
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,430
So you're Attendant Yu.

63
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:17,950
Indeed.

64
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,111
You're awfully young
to be handed a job like this.

65
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes.

66
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,270
Opportunities like this are rare.

67
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,720
Hence my visit.

68
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,830
Well then, may you prosper
in your career.

69
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,920
But let me be blunt,

70
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,950
candle prices

71
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,190
change by the day now.

72
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,360
We'll trade
according to the market price.

73
00:05:53,288 --> 00:05:54,466
The market price?

74
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:55,044
Yes.

75
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,355
Are you messing with me?

76
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,630
Sanlang,

77
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,510
I'm procuring these candles
for the Right Chancellor himself.

78
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,270
Would I dare be careless?

79
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,920
Your connections in
Chang'an are extensive.

80
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,830
Feel free to verify this.

81
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,000
Attendant Yu,

82
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:29,240
how much of a cut do you want?

83
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,000
Not a coin.

84
00:06:31,422 --> 00:06:33,200
You may keep all the profits.

85
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,070
In all my years,

86
00:06:38,422 --> 00:06:40,630
I've never encountered such strangeness.

87
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,600
Suddenly I feel

88
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,920
a little uneasy.

89
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,160
Attendant Yu,

90
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,270
what is it that you really want?

91
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,955
I merely seek to relieve
the Right Chancellor's burdens.

92
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,240
Fine.

93
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:01,288
The Right Chancellor's
standards are exacting.

94
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:03,340
Sanlang, I must trouble you
to take this seriously.

95
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,000
My very life depends on it.

96
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,920
Has he lost his mind?

97
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,270
How's he going

98
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,160
to explain that price
to the Right Chancellor?

99
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,120
I've been puzzling over the same thing.

100
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,310
Yet he agreed

101
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,488
to these exorbitant prices
without hesitation.

102
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,133
I suspect he's brewing some scheme.

103
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,120
That sneaky rascal.

104
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:33,066
Chief Eunuch Wang, then should we...

105
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,120
Should we what?

106
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:39,390
I'm not going to turn down easy money.

107
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,000
If he comes back again,

108
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,510
triple the price.

109
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,240
I'd like to see

110
00:07:49,044 --> 00:07:51,800
how long he can keep this up.

111
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:54,066
Yes.

112
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,420
(Jianchang Funeral Goods -
Every Funerary Need Supplied)

113
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,133
The candles have arrived.

114
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,066
Send them back.

115
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,688
Send them back?

116
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,822
Send them back.

117
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,311
The candles were rejected?

118
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,390
Why?

119
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,040
This has me in an absolute panic.

120
00:08:26,866 --> 00:08:28,600
When the candles were
delivered to the palace,

121
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,480
I brought a sample

122
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,630
to show the Right Chancellor,

123
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,720
but before I even got close,

124
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,400
he looked from afar and said,

125
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,733
"Unusable."

126
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,720
Sanlang,

127
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,870
I told you before,

128
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,355
my very life depends on this.

129
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,120
I beg you to find another batch

130
00:08:49,222 --> 00:08:51,688
of quality candles to save me,

131
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,720
Sanlang...

132
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,390
It's not that there aren't

133
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,550
good candles in Chang'an,

134
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,390
but over the past few days,

135
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,750
the price has doubled again.

136
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,622
Money's not an issue.

137
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,870
Market price?

138
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,390
Alright.

139
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,720
The candles are here.

140
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
But with all this

141
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,200
back and forth,

142
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:27,955
you've spent three to four times
more than last time.

143
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,666
How are you going to explain that?

144
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,240
Send them back again.

145
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,910
Are you out of your mind? Again?

146
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,750
I've inspected them.
They're top quality.

147
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,222
If you send them back again,
how will you explain that?

148
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,670
Tomorrow morning,

149
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,488
you will go see Sanlang on my behalf.

150
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,150
When he sees you,

151
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,960
he'll ask why.

152
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,440
Just tell him...

153
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,350
The Right Chancellor
took one look at the candles

154
00:09:52,355 --> 00:09:53,555
and said only one word,

155
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,720
"Unusable."

156
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,720
Why are these unusable too?

157
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,066
Please just hurry
and take care of the matter.

158
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,510
Sir! Sir!

159
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,390
Sir! Sir!

160
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,270
Have you found Chief Eunuch Wang?

161
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,910
We tried everything we could,

162
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,870
but he's vanished.

163
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
The palace staff says

164
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,240
no one

165
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,270
has seen him for days.

166
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,320
Sanlang,

167
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,790
what do we do now?

168
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,440
Find him! Find him!

169
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,270
Yes!

170
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,750
Find me Chief Eunuch Wang!

171
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,440
Yes!

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,480
I'm in so much trouble.

173

=Episode 30=

174
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,380
(Grave of Li)

175
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,910
Shortly after you left,

176
00:10:46,644 --> 00:10:48,080
officials from the Inspector's Office

177
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,080
came here asking about you.

178
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,390
Later, some Dong people

179
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,750
saw Captain Yang chasing Li.

180
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,080
Li was running toward

181
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,480
the road to the Western Capital.

182
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,790
Li was luring the pursuers away for me.

183
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,840
I'm just

184
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,790
transporting a few measly litchis.

185
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,480
Why would the Inspector's Office
want to kill me?

186
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,910
We searched for hours

187
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,320
but never found his body.

188
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,360
Then in the mountains,

189
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,240
we discovered his shoes

190
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,270
and some bones.

191
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:25,910
He must have run himself
to death on the road,

192
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,600
then the wild animals

193
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
ate his body.

194
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,630
I was born a servant.

195
00:11:35,822 --> 00:11:38,111
When have I ever had
the chance to earn any merit?

196
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,030
Li,

197
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,360
I swear I'll get

198
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,030
these litchis to Chang'an,

199
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,200
so your spirit

200
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,910
may rest in peace.

201
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,420
(Grave of Li)

202
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,740
(Loyal)

203
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,580
(Servant)

204
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,820
(Loyal servant)

205
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:03,740
(Grave of Li, A loyal Servant)

206
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,260
(Inspector's Office)

207
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,670
Have the gifts for Inspector Yu

208
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,120
been delivered?

209
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,644
I've ordered someone to deliver them.

210
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,200
We specifically selected

211
00:13:15,222 --> 00:13:16,666
a box of premium southern pearls,

212
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:17,666
each one perfectly round.

213
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,990
Last night,

214
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,720
I was tormented by nightmares.

215
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,200
And this morning, my eyelid
just wouldn't stop twitching.

216
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,600
Don't worry.

217
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:31,422
I personally instructed the servants

218
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,822
to first deliver the gift list,

219
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:34,329
then place the actual gifts nearby

220
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,750
so they could pick them up themselves.

221
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,910
The highest form of gift-giving

222
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,550
is to give discreetly and subtly,

223
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,670
so they can accept without concern.

224
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,390
Well done.

225
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,670
My chickens

226
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,510
are so beautiful.

227
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,270
Inspector He.

228
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:51,840
Speak.

229
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,960
Inspector Yu rejected the gift list.

230
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,720
What nonsense is this?

231
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,790
Useless fool.

232
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,840
Worthless idiot.

233
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,670
How did that happen?

234
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,840
Put it away.

235
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,510
Go!

236
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,840
Unbelievable.

237
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,630
Zhao,

238
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:08,320
feeling that slap yet?

239
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,510
You just made a fool of yourself.

240
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:14,990
He...

241
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,080
All these years,

242
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,390
every time you're
brimming with confidence,

243
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,120
I'm gripped by terror.

244
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,390
Every time you tell me

245
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,150
not to worry,

246
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,870
my heart would leap into my throat.

247
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,270
You always mess up.

248
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,866
You can't even manage to deliver a gift.

249
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,510
This is just posturing!

250
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,240
Playing hard to get!

251
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,822
Trying to make us beg them
like we're seeking out a reclusive sage?

252
00:14:33,844 --> 00:14:34,960
It's not that simple.

253
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,960
Do you remember

254
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:38,200
what Inspector Yu said

255
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,630
the first time he met me?

256
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,440
He called me a flood dragon of the sea.

257
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:43,870
"Wave-riding dragon"

258
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,866
is the nickname I was known
by back in the day.

259
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,600
How did he know that?

260
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,870
It's just a coincidence, that's all.

261
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,870
And he said he wanted to

262
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,120
"catch up with an old friend."

263
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,390
The tone was so venomous.

264
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,960
The more I think about it,

265
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:04,670
the more I wonder
if he was implying something.

266
00:15:04,866 --> 00:15:05,990
You're overthinking it.

267
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,390
All eunuchs speak in that soft, sly way.

268
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,320
Precisely why I fear them!

269
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,870
When men are cut off
from natural desires,

270
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,960
only greed remains.

271
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,840
But this one clearly
has someone above him,

272
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,120
so why isn't he greedy?

273
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:21,720
He comes all the way to my territory,
and refuses my gift?

274
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,080
This unease won't leave me.

275
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,840
Actually, I just thought of someone

276
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,080
who might resolve our predicament.

277
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,720
Hurry!

278
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,150
Qilang,

279
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,750
are we running away?

280
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,480
Running?

281
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,530
Do I look like someone who
runs away from anything?

282
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,320
We found where Chai was staying.

283
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,670
Let's hurry and go find him.

284
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,960
I thought you were scared

285
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,910
of Inspector Yu from Chang'an.

286
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,030
Would anyone scare me?

287
00:15:58,466 --> 00:15:59,466
If I were scared,

288
00:15:59,488 --> 00:16:01,550
I'd have died a dozen times
over in Lingnan already.

289
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,688
Even if someone from Inspector's Office
came knocking now,

290
00:16:03,688 --> 00:16:04,644
I still wouldn't flinch.

291
00:16:09,622 --> 00:16:10,390
Go take a look.

292
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,480
Who is it?

293
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,720
It's me.

294
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:27,240
Chief Scribe Zhao.

295
00:16:37,044 --> 00:16:38,155
Ping'an.

296
00:16:46,844 --> 00:16:47,840
Ping'an.

297
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,630
Ah, I've always appreciated Chang'an's

298
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,150
distinctive greetings.

299
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,870
It's changed now.

300
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,580
We say...

301
00:16:57,688 --> 00:16:59,300
Greetings, man.

302
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,020
Why are you shutting
the door in this heat?

303
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,980
I caught a chill.

304
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,660
My body's delicate.

305
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,460
Then you'd better rest.

306
00:17:10,844 --> 00:17:12,060
What's with the packed bundle?

307
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,020
Planning a trip?

308
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,660
Thought I'd go hiking.

309
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,340
Wind's even stronger up there.

310
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,660
Still, I have to go.

311
00:17:19,844 --> 00:17:21,020
I have to pray for blessings.

312
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,300
Hope I recover soon.

313
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,150
Chief Scribe Zhao,
you're visiting at this hour.

314
00:17:26,155 --> 00:17:27,311
Must be something urgent?

315
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,420
If it's not,

316
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,820
let's talk another time.

317
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,244
It's not me, just that Inspector He
wants to see you.

318
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,660
Please come.

319
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,420
Guiyun!

320
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,000
Youguang!

321
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,540
Look at you, full of energy,

322
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,060
beaming with confidence,

323
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,020
radiating prosperity!

324
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,060
Sit, sit.

325
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,060
I've been drowning my sorrows in wine.

326
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,700
What I've gained isn't fat,

327
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,100
it's the weight of my longing
for the Right Chancellor.

328
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:07,980
You're always going on about how much

329
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,140
you miss the Right Chancellor.

330
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,260
Now one of his people

331
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,700
has come all the way to Lingnan.

332
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,900
Why haven't you visited him

333
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,340
and inquired after
the Right Chancellor's wellbeing?

334
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,260
That's right.

335
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,540
Xinmin, are you talking about

336
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,900
Attendant Yu from the inner court?

337
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,580
Yes.

338
00:18:27,422 --> 00:18:29,260
That's an offensive suggestion, Xinmin.

339
00:18:30,422 --> 00:18:31,660
I'm an outer court official.

340
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,711
He's just an eunuch.

341
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,500
How could we be considered colleagues?

342
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,900
Chief Scribe Zhao,

343
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,140
have you been chewing sugarcane

344
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,180
until your mouth

345
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,380
leaks nonsense?

346
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,700
Forgive him, Guiyun.

347
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,260
What he meant

348
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,860
to say was,

349
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,740
he knows that Attendant Yu

350
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,980
was personally promoted
by the Right Chancellor.

351
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,780
And since you also
served the Chancellor,

352
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,820
you two were like
his left and right hand.

353
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,540
Naturally you two should be close.

354
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,060
That's why he said what he did.

355
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,420
Don't say another word!

356
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,980
Yes.

357
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:10,900
Guiyun,

358
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,780
you know I consider you family.

359
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,540
So I'll just

360
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,820
speak plainly.

361
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,700
Of course, go on.

362
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,060
The reason I invited you here is

363
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,900
I'd like to ask for a favor.

364
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,860
You see, Attendant Yu has been

365
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,340
in Lingnan for days,

366
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,060
yet we've only exchanged
formal greetings once.

367
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:30,900
We didn't even sit
down for a meal together.

368
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,540
As the local host,

369
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,700
I failed to show proper hospitality.

370
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,060
It's such a shame.

371
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,460
What I'm trying to say is,

372
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,300
I was hoping

373
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,500
you might help me out

374
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,740
to arrange an introduction.

375
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,140
Help open some doors

376
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,900
for me.

377
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,260
I get it now, Youguang.

378
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,540
But I'm afraid I can't help you.

379
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,460
I don't know him.

380
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,622
You don't know him?

381
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,540
Yes, I don't.

382
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,620
The Right Chancellor
holds multiple offices.

383
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,900
He has dozens of official seals,

384
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,740
and commands hundreds of men.

385
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,700
I can't possibly know
every one of them, can I?

386
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,300
I don't know him.

387
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,700
Why does that sound

388
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,860
so familiar?

389
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,333
Last time the Right Chancellor

390
00:20:30,422 --> 00:20:32,380
sent a secret envoy
with a confidential letter,

391
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,940
Guiyun said the same thing.

392
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,060
Guiyun,

393
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,020
you served

394
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,940
the Right Chancellor for years,

395
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,460
don't tell me you don't know

396
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:47,466
a single one of his close men?

397
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,860
Youguang,

398
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,460
now that I don't like hearing.

399
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,620
Do you know what a secret envoy is?

400
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,780
Enlighten me.

401
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,420
The key to their survival

402
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,860
is that no one knows who they are.

403
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,600
If I showed up with drums and gongs,

404
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,780
and welcomed them with fanfare,

405
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,422
what kind of secret envoy would that be?

406
00:21:08,422 --> 00:21:10,120
So is that a problem
that I don't know him?

407
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,820
Guiyun,

408
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,020
please don't be mad.

409
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,380
It's totally fine

410
00:21:17,755 --> 00:21:18,740
that you don't know him.

411
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,940
Guiyun,

412
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,900
you've lived in Chang'an for years.

413
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,700
You know better than anyone

414
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,220
how things work in official circles.

415
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,580
So, give me some advice.

416
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,460
Since Attendant Yu arrived in Lingnan,

417
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,020
he has been refusing
meeting invitations and visits,

418
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,940
keeping his distance.

419
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,420
What is he thinking?

420
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,820
In Chang'an,
when people build connections,

421
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,140
we give gifts.

422
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,540
We offered gifts,

423
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,460
but he rejected them.

424
00:21:56,511 --> 00:21:58,300
- That's right.
- It must've been too modest.

425
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,140
Not everyone

426
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,820
is like my master,

427
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,980
easily satisfied.

428
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:04,500
Watch your tongue.

429
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,940
But that does make sense.

430
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,340
Think about it, Attendant Yu

431
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,060
has seen the finest treasures

432
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,060
in all of Chang'an.

433
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,100
Inspector He,

434
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,180
you'll need to dig a little deeper
into your pockets.

435
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,860
That's not a problem.

436
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,820
But what should I send?

437
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,620
What's special in Lingnan?

438
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,220
The Southern pearls.

439
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,660
I sent them.

440
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,620
He rejected them.

441
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,540
That's right.

442
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:37,020
He rejected them...

443
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,300
Beauties?

444
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,260
Give to whom?

445
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,540
That's not an appropriate gift either.

446
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,180
Indeed.

447
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,260
So, beauties are out,

448
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,260
and pearls are out...

449
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,740
He's here for litchis.

450
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,860
Lingnan litchis will surely take

451
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,700
the Tang court by storm one day.

452
00:22:59,220 --> 00:22:59,980
Inspector He,

453
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,180
select a few prime litchi orchards,

454
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,820
and give him the deeds.

455
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,500
That, he probably won't refuse.

456
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,660
Give him a few orchards.

457
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,140
So you're saying,

458
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,980
gold bars won't cut it.

459
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,860
I have to give him the gold mine?

460
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,260
You have to give to gain,

461
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,500
my dear Youguang.

462
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,660
Even if I go all in

463
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,980
and hand him the deeds

464
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,660
to the orchards,

465
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,420
will he really take them?

466
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,420
If he doesn't take them,

467
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,140
then just remember this,

468
00:23:46,644 --> 00:23:47,780
he's an idiot.

469
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,220
If he rejects them,

470
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,700
I'm an idiot.

471
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,940
If you may excuse me.

472
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,100
I've summoned you here

473
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,540
to share some good news.

474
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,660
Inspector He has decreed

475
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,060
our association shall contribute
200 guan

476
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,300
for the litchi transport.

477
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,860
So let's divide up the amount
among ourselves today.

478
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,740
Shared joy is double joy,

479
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:21,980
right?

480
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:28,140
If we hadn't been told to pull
our investment at the last minute,

481
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,580
we'd all

482
00:24:29,822 --> 00:24:32,300
be sharing in the joy.

483
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,140
Now Mr. Su soars alone

484
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,100
while we foot his celebration.

485
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,900
Does this sit well with any of you?

486
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:42,820
That's right.

487
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,500
We'll pay,

488
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,540
but perhaps Mr. Su would

489
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,340
at least let us take part
in the venture too?

490
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,820
If we can't feast,

491
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,220
at least let us lick the bowl.

492
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,900
The profits from this litchi transport

493
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,740
will flow

494
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,540
like the mighty Yangtze River.

495
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,700
Mr. Xiao,

496
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,660
you're not like Amita.

497
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,820
You ought to look out
for your own people.

498
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,780
That's right.

499
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,940
I've considered what you said.

500
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,180
To tell you the truth,

501
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,660
I'm hosting a banquet
for Mr. Su this evening

502
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,300
at Qifeng Pavilion.

503
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,180
From the sound of it,

504
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,540
there's still room
to turn things around?

505
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,340
Back when things were dire,

506
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,220
it was I who lent him a ship,

507
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,420
only then did he manage to
cover the last leg of his transport.

508
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,700
But now,

509
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,300
boarding that vessel won't be easy.

510
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,820
Mr. Xiao, you've always
treated others with kindness,

511
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,660
and it's only right
that you're rewarded for it.

512
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,380
If you could help us

513
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,580
get on board that ship,

514
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,780
we'll never forget what you did.

515
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,220
When the profits come rolling in,

516
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,020
we'll take the small share,

517
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,620
and you'll take the large.

518
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,820
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

519
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,540
As the chief

520
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,420
of the association,

521
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,620
of course, I won't hesitate
to lend a hand to everyone.

522
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,820
But whether you make it
onto that ship or not,

523
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,740
depends on how much effort

524
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,260
you're willing to put in.

525
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,540
Mr. Xiao,

526
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,020
Mr. Su is here.

527
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,860
Make away.

528
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,933
All the senior members are here?

529
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,820
I had only intended
to share a quiet drink

530
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,420
with Mr. Xiao.

531
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,220
I didn't expect such a grand gathering.

532
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,700
Mr. Su.

533
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,540
Please take a seat.

534
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,140
Please.

535
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,660
Please.

536
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,180
Mr. Su,

537
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,420
your visionary wisdom

538
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,980
steers ships that weather any storm.

539
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,140
Please sit, Mr. Su.

540
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,060
Mr. Su,

541
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,900
as chief of the association,
I carry great responsibility.

542
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,060
Today, I hope to lead everyone

543
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,100
aboard your great ship together.

544
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,460
Come now, don't say that.

545
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,020
No matter how large my ship,

546
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,860
without the breeze you all provide,

547
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,460
it would never reach the shore.

548
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,340
You're too modest, Mr. Su.

549
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,300
Rest assured, everyone,

550
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,180
we should keep the wealth within family.

551
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:40,180
We're all outsiders
here in a foreign land,

552
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,020
so it's only right
we look after one another.

553
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,020
It's only right.

554
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,060
However,

555
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,460
a meal must be eaten one bite at a time,

556
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,900
and a journey taken step by step.

557
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,380
Once I've finalized the contract

558
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,780
with Mr. Li,

559
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,460
we'll carefully plan
the next steps together.

560
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,140
How about that?

561
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,380
- That's great!
- Yes!

562
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,100
We'll be counting on you, Mr. Su!

563
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,660
Would you kindly announce me,

564
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,780
Zhao Xinmin,
Chief Scribe of Inspector's Office,

565
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,940
requests an audience?

566
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,500
Inspector Yu is unwell
and bedridden today.

567
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,700
He's unable to receive guests.

568
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,460
Chief Scribe Zhao,

569
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,340
perhaps you could come another day.

570
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,700
Inspector Yu is unwell?

571
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,460
Let me summon
the best physician in Lingnan

572
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,100
to tend to him at once.

573
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,090
That won't be necessary.

574
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,740
He has taken a special remedy prepared

575
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,200
by the imperial court's physician.

576
00:28:27,244 --> 00:28:29,700
As long as he's not disturbed,

577
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,420
a couple days of rest should suffice.

578
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,780
Ah,

579
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,700
then I've come at just the right time.

580
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,980
Since Attendant Yu is bedridden,

581
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,180
he must surely be feeling bored.

582
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:43,300
I've brought a meticulously selected

583
00:28:44,466 --> 00:28:45,980
white-eye songbird.

584
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,820
Its cheerful chirping

585
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,420
will be just the thing

586
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,620
to soothe his ears.

587
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,940
This little bird may be
small and delicate,

588
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,780
but its chirping is bright and clear.

589
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:57,980
Listen.

590
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,300
How thoughtful of you.

591
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,740
Here in the palace,

592
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,820
people come and go all day long,

593
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,700
and peace and quiet is a rare thing.

594
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,780
Just the other day,

595
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,260
Attendant Yu said

596
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,140
his ears could use a little company.

597
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,020
Thank you.

598
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,100
It's only my duty.

599
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,780
Chief Scribe Zhao.

600
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,180
Chief Scribe Zhao,

601
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,260
we'll keep the bird,

602
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,740
but please take
the letter in the cage back.

603
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,780
That's a confidential letter
for Inspector Yu.

604
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,500
Chief Scribe Zhao,

605
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,100
I'll relay the contents

606
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,740
to Inspector Yu myself.

607
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,900
But let me remind you,

608
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,580
don't send more letters.

609
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,260
You shouldn't make decisions
on his behalf

610
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,911
as you might be making mistakes.

611
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,940
Chief Scribe Zhao,

612
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,220
if I hadn't read the letter first,

613
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,740
and Inspector Yu had seen it himself,

614
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:14,540
we'd all be in trouble now.

615
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,780
Chief Scribe Zhao, please.

616
00:30:26,222 --> 00:30:27,377
My apologies for the trouble.

617
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,820
Rascal.

618
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,380
Stupid sugar canes!

619
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,940
Don't just leave it around!

620
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,140
Who...

621
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,540
Who left

622
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,660
these here?

623
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,140
If I caught you, I'd cut your tongue!

624
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,180
Judging by your mood,

625
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,020
I'm guessing the gift
was rejected again.

626
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,020
Amita.

627
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:07,088
If it's official business,

628
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,420
you can talk to me

629
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,022
at the Inspector's Office tomorrow.

630
00:31:10,022 --> 00:31:10,911
Chief Scribe Zhao.

631
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,780
I came here today
specifically to talk to you.

632
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,620
Amita,

633
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,700
I was only doing my duty

634
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,060
when I ordered
the hunt for you that day.

635
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,020
Please understand.

636
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,820
Seeing you return

637
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,460
to Lingnan safe and sound today,

638
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,060
I'm truly relieved.

639
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,460
Chief Scribe Zhao,

640
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,980
ever since you told me about Tu,

641
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,260
I knew you had a conscience.

642
00:31:39,466 --> 00:31:40,580
You see more clearly than I do

643
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,460
just how corrupt

644
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,060
He Youguang has been all these years.

645
00:31:44,688 --> 00:31:46,580
It's a shame
he doesn't recognize talent.

646
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,860
You've been badly stifled
under his command.

647
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,100
Join forces with me

648
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,700
and bring down He Youguang.

649
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,540
I'm just a minor scribe

650
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,260
in the Inspector's Office.

651
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,580
You overestimate me.

652
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,500
Please...

653
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,100
Please don't mess with me, will you?

654
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,660
You don't need to get involved directly.

655
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,620
Just give me the evidence

656
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,740
of He Youguang's corruption
over the years.

657
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,860
What evidence?

658
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,060
Every matter in the Inspector's Office,

659
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,300
big or small,

660
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,060
passes through your hands.

661
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,620
When it comes to secrets, you know even

662
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,933
more than He Youguang himself.

663
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,260
Since you've known

664
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,940
that he's a heartless, selfish man,

665
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:26,420
surely you've left yourself

666
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,420
a way out.

667
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,140
He Youguang killed my father.

668
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,380
I will not stop

669
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,500
until I take him down.

670
00:32:35,555 --> 00:32:37,900
I'm able to return safely today
with the identity granted

671
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,860
by the Right Chancellor,

672
00:32:39,288 --> 00:32:40,460
I believe you're smart enough

673
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,860
to make a wise choice.

674
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,300
Joining me is the winning side.

675
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,380
I'll give you a sum of money,

676
00:32:46,777 --> 00:32:48,022
enough for you to leave Lingnan,

677
00:32:48,044 --> 00:32:50,740
stay out of danger, and live comfortably
for the rest of your life.

678
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,380
Amita,

679
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,700
I've never once thought
of leaving Lingnan.

680
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,900
My wife is waiting

681
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,420
for me to come back for dinner.

682
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:03,740
I have to go.

683
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,580
I am Su Liang. Greetings, Attendant Yu.

684
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,700
To have the chance
to work alongside Mr. Li

685
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,940
in service of His Majesty

686
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,620
is the greatest honor of my life.

687
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,700
Mr. Su, please rise.

688
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,140
You've gone to great effort.

689
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,220
Though you're a Hu merchant,

690
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,060
your loyalty
and your wholehearted dedication

691
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,660
to our empire

692
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,540
are rare and admirable.

693
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,220
Please get Mr. Su a chair.

694
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:00,860
Yes.

695
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:02,820
Mr. Li.

696
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,140
Thank you, Attendant Yu.

697
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,500
Previously, regarding fresh litchis

698
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,140
and the authority over transport,

699
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,580
Mr. Li and I

700
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,844
had reached an understanding.

701
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,780
To ensure the litchis are delivered

702
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,900
smoothly and securely,

703
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,420
and to guarantee

704
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,300
that His Majesty and the Noble Consort

705
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,420
can enjoy fresh litchis

706
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,660
year after year,

707
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,700
I will pour my heart into it,

708
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,900
exhaust every effort,

709
00:34:36,933 --> 00:34:37,940
and spare no resource.

710
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,220
Here is the contract.

711
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:51,020
Please review and sign it.

712
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,860
Mr. Su,

713
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,220
this trade route was specially
commissioned by His Majesty

714
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,940
for the Noble Consort's

715
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,340
birthday celebration.

716
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,780
If we were to entrust it to outsiders...

717
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:15,860
Mr. Su,

718
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,580
let me put it this way.

719
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,460
Who's to say what might

720
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,060
reach Chang'an,

721
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,500
litchis or blades?

722
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,780
Mr. Su, no offense meant.

723
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,580
I'm merely speaking
to the matter itself.

724
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,020
Mr. Li,

725
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,300
we bear

726
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:43,740
the trust of His Majesty.

727
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,380
One misstep

728
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,380
could ignite a trail of disaster.

729
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:50,860
Mr. Li,

730
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,300
you may be willing

731
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,860
to risk your head for a promise,

732
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,620
but we cannot gamble

733
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,220
with His Majesty's reputation.

734
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,220
You're right, Inspector Yu.

735
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,860
Since this concerns
the safety of His Majesty

736
00:36:15,933 --> 00:36:17,511
and the security of Tang territory,

737
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,500
if the travel permits
are to be withheld,

738
00:36:20,466 --> 00:36:21,660
so be it.

739
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,180
However,

740
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,180
I will take full responsibility
for the allocation and oversight

741
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,580
of the horses and riders

742
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,500
needed for the transport.

743
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,100
Surely this wouldn't pose

744
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,500
a threat

745
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,740
to His Majesty's safety

746
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,140
and endanger the realm?

747
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:37,940
That's a good idea.

748
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,380
Really.

749
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,060
Having Mr. Su

750
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,260
manage the horses

751
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,820
saves us

752
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,100
a lot of trouble.

753
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:45,660
Yes.

754
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,700
This is very beneficial!

755
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,340
If the horses

756
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,600
don't come from the official stables
along the route,

757
00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:51,900
should the Right Chancellor

758
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,780
question this one day,

759
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,140
it would be difficult
for our offices to explain.

760
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,580
Mr. Su, how about this,

761
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,460
if you have horses to provide,

762
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,140
I can reach out to
the stable supervisors along the way

763
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,540
to purchase your animals.

764
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,420
Rest assured,

765
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,420
you'll be compensated at premium prices.

766
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,900
Very well,

767
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,540
I'll

768
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,220
concede further.

769
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:38,740
But the construction
and management rights

770
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,260
for relay stations along the route,

771
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,580
please entrust to me.

772
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,100
Rest assured,

773
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,620
the merchant's association

774
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,380
will fully fund their construction.

775
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,820
No burden to the court.

776
00:37:55,377 --> 00:37:56,580
That's perfectly acceptable!

777
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,780
Really!

778
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,660
The Hu Merchants' Association

779
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,000
has traveled these trade routes.

780
00:38:01,022 --> 00:38:02,420
They have plenty of experience

781
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,930
in building and managing relay stations.

782
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:05,820
If they're providing the funds,

783
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,020
it's only right they are granted

784
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,155
a few years of usage rights.

785
00:38:09,155 --> 00:38:10,180
It's only right.

786
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,020
Mr. Su has gone above and beyond

787
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,900
for me,

788
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,300
and he even sold off his own ship.

789
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,420
He's shown great loyalty.

790
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:22,980
Mr. Li,

791
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,220
how about this,

792
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,820
I'll make note
of Mr. Su's contributions.

793
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,420
When I return to Chang'an,

794
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,111
I'll speak with the
Ministry of Revenue.

795
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,380
All the costs

796
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,260
Mr. Su covered before,

797
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,340
I'll make sure they're

798
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,340
properly accounted for
and reimbursed in full,

799
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,740
with interest,

800
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,300
out of the transport budget.

801
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:45,140
Also, I'll request an honorary plaque

802
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,500
naming Mr. Su as an "Honest Merchant."

803
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,220
With that plaque,

804
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,020
even the Maritime Trade Commissioner

805
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,700
will have to show you some respect.

806
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,580
When the litchi transport began,

807
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,940
everyone saw it as a doomed venture.

808
00:39:03,044 --> 00:39:04,140
They understood the risks

809
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,540
and avoided them like the plague.

810
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,260
But I poured in everything I had

811
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,260
to help Mr. Li

812
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,260
complete the initial trial run.

813
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,860
The hardship I endured,

814
00:39:14,488 --> 00:39:15,860
and the risks I shouldered...

815
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,860
Forgive me, Attendant Yu,

816
00:39:24,177 --> 00:39:25,660
but I'm no beggar.

817
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,260
What I seek

818
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,000
is not charity.

819
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,780
Mr. Su,

820
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,780
there's no business in the world

821
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,380
that guarantees pure profit
without risk.

822
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,020
Surely you didn't

823
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,620
expect to grow fat

824
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,780
off imperial business?

825
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,740
I understand now.

826
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,260
I was presumptuous

827
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,500
and expected too much.

828
00:40:12,533 --> 00:40:13,800
I should take my leave.

829
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:23,980
Mr. Su.

830
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,580
Mr. Su.

831
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,460
Mr. Su.

832
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,460
Mr. Su.

833
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,780
Mr. Su...

834
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,020
So this...

835
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,460
This is what you call a promise?

836
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,260
This is

837
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,020
the so-called benefactor you speak of?

838
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,580
I see it now.

839
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,780
You're not a loyal dog.

840
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,220
None of you are

841
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,780
a grateful, loyal dog.

842
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,620
Mr. Su...

843
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,780
Mr. Su, I will never forget

844
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,580
your kindness

845
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,060
and your favor.

846
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,340
But the court

847
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,020
has its own considerations.

848
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:02,860
For now,

849
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,266
there's really nothing I can do.

850
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,860
Let me ask you,

851
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,820
did you already know there was

852
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,260
another arrangement made
for the litchi transport?

853
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,333
No, I didn't!

854
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,620
I swear I didn't!

855
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,700
I could decide the logistics

856
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,688
of the litchi transport,

857
00:41:16,711 --> 00:41:18,780
but the funds and resources

858
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,780
come through another channel.

859
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,500
That part's not under my authority.

860
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,900
Tell me this then,

861
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,500
just what is under your authority?

862
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,700
What's under my authority
stays under my authority.

863
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,580
Repayment won't be a problem,

864
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,340
not the money,

865
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,333
not the interest.

866
00:41:33,355 --> 00:41:35,640
We'll make sure you didn't
go through all that for nothing.

867
00:41:35,644 --> 00:41:36,980
For nothing? It's worse than that.

868
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,780
I'm left with broken eggs

869
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,980
and a ruined reputation!

870
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,940
But the fault lies not with me!

871
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,340
It lies with this!

872
00:41:48,688 --> 00:41:51,259
It's not enough that an eunuch
is here to intimidate me?

873
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,820
Now you're adding
the Right Chancellor's token on top of it?

874
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,860
That's not what I meant.

875
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,020
Really, I did not mean that.

876
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,020
Mr. Su,

877
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,260
I'll plead with Attendant Yu again.

878
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,760
If he can't decide,
I'll plead with the Right Chancellor.

879
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,155
I will see the original promise fulfilled.
Please believe me.

880
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,260
I'll even stop his carriage
if I must to honor our agreement!

881
00:42:08,311 --> 00:42:09,060
I've heard enough.

882
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,300
For the sake of our friendship,

883
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,180
I won't blame you anymore.

884
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,900
But now I understand perfectly

885
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:18,540
what it means to kill the donkey
once it's done grinding the mill.

886
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,060
I am that donkey.

887
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,540
That foolish beast you people

888
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,740
used up and slaughtered.

889
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,500
=The Lichi Road=

890
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:39,780
I've got another heart-wrenching tale

891
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,900
to add to my collection.

892
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,140
Attendant Yu stays aloof

893
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,420
because he wants no connection with you.

894
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,260
He's seeking

895
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,020
his own profitable path.

896
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,140
They want our lives.

897
00:42:59,060 --> 00:42:59,980
Sometimes

898
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,140
I wonder

899
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,420
if you are still on my side.
