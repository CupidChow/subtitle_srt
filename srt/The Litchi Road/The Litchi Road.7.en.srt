00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,999
=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,060
(Weaving Flower Baskets)

3
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,490
Does this go with this?

4
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,459
No, this one goes with this.

5
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:49,819
No.

6
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,490
That's the previous step.

7
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,210
This one goes with this.

8
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,379
Why don't you go to sleep, Xiu'er?
I'm here.

9
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,530
No, I haven't finished weaving yet.

10
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,619
Go to sleep.

11
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,259
When you wake up,

12
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,499
I'll have finished weaving

13
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,690
this flower basket for you.

14
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,810
Here.

15
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,459
Tuck yourself in.

16
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,650
Alright.

17
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,770
Put your hands inside.

18
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,490
Tuck yourself in.

19
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,330
Close your eyes.

20
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,499
It's too tiring to weave it yourself.

21
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,170
I want to accompany you.

22
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,280
You can accompany me
even with your eyes closed.

23
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,259
I paid so much tuition

24
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,539
to your embroidery house,

25
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,050
but I'm the one getting trained.

26
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,499
Close your eyes.

27
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,690
I'm looking at you.

28
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,899
What about yours?

29
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,170
Mine is prettier.

30
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:33,899
How pretty.

31
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,779
It's evenly woven

32
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,219
and neatly shaped.

33
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,579
How beautiful.

34
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,099
How did you weave your flower basket?

35
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,899
Teach us.

36
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,499
Yes.

37
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,739
- Teach us.
- Teach us.

38
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,699
Xiu'er.

39
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,259
Did you really weave

40
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,010
such a beautiful flower basket yourself?

41
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,419
When my mother bought tofu

42
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,939
early in the morning,

43
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,979
she saw your father

44
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,499
buying a flower basket nearby.

45
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,459
Impossible.

46
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,259
I...

47
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,859
Did you really weave this yourself?

48
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,170
Give it back!

49
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,779
You must have bought it.

50
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,019
My mother came back and said

51
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,899
your father's bargaining skills

52
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,530
attracted a lot of attention.

53
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,219
Don't say that about my father.

54
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:05,979
Did you make

55
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,330
the flower baskets yourselves?

56
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,019
Give it back!

57
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,859
My mother made flower basket for me.

58
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,459
Yes, mine too.

59
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,459
Mine too.

60
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,560
Won't your mother help you
weave the flower basket?

61
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,219
I heard her mother died of illness.

62
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,139
Her father must have bought
this flower basket

63
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,730
from the market!

64
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,459
Xiu'er's father is good at bargaining.

65
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,339
He bought a flower basket to fool her.

66
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,890
Don't say that about my father!

67
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,170
Don't grab it.

68
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,419
Xiu'er.

69
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,650
Give it back!

70
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,019
No.

71
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,059
How dare you smile?

72
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,219
Why are you looking at me?

73
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,570
Who should I look at then?

74
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,810
What does it taste like?

75
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,419
It's salty.

76
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,690
Salty.

77
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,890
No, how many people beat you up?

78
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,210
Six.

79
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,690
Six?

80
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,979
Six people beat you,
and you're still smiling.

81
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,099
Who won?

82
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,290
I won.

83
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,210
Six people beat you, and you won?

84
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,779
How are

85
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,819
the others?

86
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,739
You didn't see it.

87
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,650
Some of them have swollen eyes.

88
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,970
Swollen eyes?

89
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,099
No, why did you

90
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,290
fight?

91
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,619
Because of the flower basket.

92
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,379
They were jealous
of my beautiful flower basket

93
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,499
and stepped on the flower basket
that you wove.

94
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,259
They also said
you didn't weave it yourself.

95
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,810
I was so angry.

96
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,170
It's just a flower basket.

97
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,619
No.

98
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,179
I'll

99
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,459
weave another one for you.

100
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,059
Really?

101
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,179
You'll weave it yourself?

102
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,370
I'll weave it myself.

103
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,299
Keep in mind
that you can't fight anymore.

104
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:38,939
Got it?

105
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,219
Sure, it's a deal.

106
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:40,899
It's a deal?

107
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,730
Who did you inherit this temper from?

108
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,800
Who did you inherit this temper from?

109
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,930
From Mother.

110
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:48,899
It's a deal.

111
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,330
Here, seal the deal with blood.

112
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,560
=Episode 7=

113
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,530
(Lower A Hall)

114
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,019
Miss.

115
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,410
Mr. Zheng asked to see you.

116
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,450
You came just in time.

117
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,210
I have something life-threatening
to tell you.

118
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,450
I know.

119
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,090
Li Shande's life is in danger.

120
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,819
With his stubborn character

121
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,659
that won't listen to anything,

122
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,200
something bad will happen
sooner or later.

123
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,499
It's all his own fault.

124
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,459
Let him fend for himself.

125
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,650
It's not him.

126
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,539
He's lucky.

127
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,770
He's safe for now.

128
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,600
I'll pass a message to Zhao Xinmin

129
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,920
and tell him that Li Shande
isn't aligned with Left Chancellor

130
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,010
and remove his concerns.

131
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,450
You said it's life-threatening.

132
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,370
Whose life is it?

133
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,939
Your life

134
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,130
is under threat.

135
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,290
Miss, you're such a joker.

136
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,490
How could it be...

137
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,330
How could it be so sudden?

138
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,890
Right Chancellor
sent a new envoy to Lingnan.

139
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,899
As soon as he sees you,

140
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,650
he'll see right through your identity.

141
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,050
He'll see right my identity?

142
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,970
Fortunately, the journey is long.

143
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,210
We still have time to maneuver.

144
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,339
The new envoy has left Chang'an

145
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,419
for over 20 days.

146
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,770
Counting the time,

147
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,259
he should be in Lingnan soon.

148
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,539
Stop him!

149
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,939
I already sent experts

150
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,850
to intercept him near Xiang River.

151
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,090
Unfortunately, the envoy was skilled
in martial arts and escaped several times.

152
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,099
Later, he changed his route

153
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,370
and hid his whereabouts.

154
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,859
I arranged people

155
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,699
to ambush

156
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,170
at the main path into Lingnan.

157
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,139
This is our last chance.

158
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,170
It's also your last chance of survival.

159
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,970
We must seize this chance.

160
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,339
Make sure it's foolproof.

161
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,179
Don't be stingy
with your forces and money.

162
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,799
Attack from all directions.

163
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:44,539
I don't believe he can
fight 100 people alone.

164
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,379
Zheng Ping'an.

165
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,259
Favored by Left Chancellor

166
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,939
and entrusted by Security Bureau
to help you,

167
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,290
Konglang Guild will do our best.

168
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,779
If you want to live,

169
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,739
you must get the letter
of allegiance tomorrow and leave Lingnan.

170
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,499
Otherwise,

171
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,890
once this new envoy steps
into Inspector's Office,

172
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,970
you'll lose your life.

173
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,490
Let me see.

174
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,970
What happened?

175
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,170
Mr. Li.

176
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,610
Tell me.

177
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,979
You're still energetic

178
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,979
just half a day ago,

179
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,170
now you're suddenly sick?

180
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,490
Qilang went out for a while

181
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,450
and came back burning up.

182
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,130
Maybe he caught a cold.

183
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,979
Nonsense.

184
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,219
How can you catch a cold here?

185
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,530
He has heat stroke.

186
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,019
I know

187
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,170
you're so worried about my life

188
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,490
that you're stressed out.

189
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,610
Sit farther away from me

190
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,210
so that I can feel better.

191
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,530
Is it hot?

192
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,179
It's hot. Hurry.

193
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,899
Let's ventilate it.

194
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,099
You can't cover yourself.

195
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,819
It's cold now. Covering yourself
will only make you feel warmer.

196
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,010
Gou'er.

197
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,459
Pull up the curtains

198
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,659
on these windows.

199
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,850
Ventilate it.

200
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,090
It's hot.

201
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,970
Here, move.

202
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,170
Move.

203
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,530
I know everything.

204
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,050
Although I'm afraid of death,

205
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,970
I'm not a coward.

206
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,379
We can't collapse

207
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,730
just because

208
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,299
we're about to die.

209
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,490
Right?

210
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,330
Are you feeling better?

211
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,450
I had my fortune told when I was a kid.

212
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,179
The fortune teller said

213
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,619
my fate

214
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,170
is to survive desperate times.

215
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,450
I won't die.

216
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,250
And I have a skill.

217
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,170
I can transfer this bad luck
to someone else.

218
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,490
What are you happy about?

219
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,730
Say something helpful,

220
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,730
or get lost.

221
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,410
Aren't I comforting you?

222
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,730
Is this comforting?

223
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,419
You transfer bad luck to others.

224
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,850
Others want to live.

225
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,450
Why are you so agitated?

226
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,659
I only said I can transfer bad luck

227
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,659
to someone else.

228
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,899
You can't blame me, can you?

229
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,779
You can only say
that this person has little luck, right?

230
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,370
He's unlucky short-lived.

231
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,410
Who are you calling unlucky

232
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,530
and short-lived?

233
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,970
Get out.

234
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,490
You...

235
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,579
You're not stressed out.

236
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,450
You're possessed.

237
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,930
You won't even listen to my advice.

238
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,179
Mr. Li.

239
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,850
Stop persuading him.

240
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,170
Fine, I'll get him some medicine.

241
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,450
Take good care of him.

242
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,370
Qilang.

243
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,610
Mr. Li is thickheaded,

244
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,290
but he's sincere to you.

245
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,259
Look.

246
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,179
Once he starts fiddling

247
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,579
with litchis,

248
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,450
he forgets about everything else.

249
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,179
But he ran out

250
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,410
to buy medicine for you.

251
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,730
Mr. Li is a good man.

252
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,010
Gou'er.

253
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,490
- Coming.
- Come here.

254
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,890
Qilang.

255
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,570
Get out too.

256
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:03,259
(Siling Apothecary)

257
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,579
He opens late.

258
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,970
Maybe he'll be here soon.

259
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,330
Your flower basket is well-woven.

260
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,930
You're from Chang'an.

261
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,690
Would you like to buy a flower basket?

262
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,259
Judging from your reply,

263
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,650
are you also from Chang'an?

264
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,619
It's hard to change my accent.

265
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,050
I'm indeed from Chang'an.

266
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,530
Why are you here?

267
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,099
My husband

268
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,210
was originally an official
in Ministry of Revenue.

269
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,939
He offended Right Chancellor,

270
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,050
and the whole family was exiled here.

271
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,219
He died a few years ago.

272
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,010
I don't know how to do anything else.

273
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,059
I can only do this

274
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,730
to make ends meet.

275
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,050
How did you get around that just now?

276
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,930
A grown man like you
wants to learn this?

277
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,850
I'll come back another day
to ask for advice.

278
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,370
You got it wrong.

279
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,890
You have good eyesight.

280
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,579
Your brain

281
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,379
works faster than my abacus.

282
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,299
This minor calculation is not a big deal.

283
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,019
Sir. We ran out of Solomon's Seal.

284
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,299
We can't fill

285
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,490
this prescription.

286
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,370
I forgot.

287
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,859
Sir.

288
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,539
Solomon's Seal was sold to Hu merchants

289
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,059
a few days ago.

290
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,139
All of it?

291
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,490
I sold all of it.

292
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,579
They're in the spice business.

293
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,819
Spices are afraid of moisture.

294
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,760
Putting a few pieces of Solomon's Seal
beside the spices can prevent moisture.

295
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,170
They have a lot of spices in stock,

296
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,050
so they bought all the Solomon's Seal.

297
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,219
You...

298
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,650
How about I change it to Glehnia Root?

299
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,210
What about the price?

300
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,970
It's the same price.

301
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,490
Alright.

302
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,530
(Siling Apothecary)

303
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,810
(Glehnia Root)

304
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,410
Why is this urn double-layered?

305
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,459
Yes, it is.

306
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,130
Where did you buy this urn?

307
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,130
I've never seen it in Lingnan either.

308
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,170
I heard only Hu merchants have it.

309
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:52,739
When I

310
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,690
went to deliver
Solomon's Seal yesterday,

311
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,810
I saw them using this to store spices.

312
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,250
It's very effective in preventing spices
from deteriorating and volatilizing.

313
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,290
I thought it would be suitable
to store moisture-sensitive medicine.

314
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,739
Do they still have

315
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,979
more urns?

316
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,330
They have lots,

317
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,339
but I heard they're disposing them.

318
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,530
Where?

319
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:21,979
Where's Su?

320
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,170
He's in there.

321
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,690
Su, we got news.

322
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,290
Someone shipped the goods.

323
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,299
Really?

324
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,059
Yes.

325
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,530
Are you sure it's our goods?

326
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,770
It's our Benzoin.

327
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,890
Who shipped it?

328
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,010
It's Amita.

329
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,059
At the beginning of next month,

330
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,179
Hu Merchants' Association

331
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,930
will elect a new leader.

332
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,850
All the Hu merchants will gather.

333
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,210
Whoever can bring the best business

334
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:11,899
can be elected

335
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,890
as the new leader.

336
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,490
I hope you won't miss this opportunity.

337
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,690
No matter who gets all the attention,

338
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,779
no one can shake

339
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,139
Amita's status.

340
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,640
(Amita, Leader of Hu Merchants' Association)
During Amita's tenure as leader,

341
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,490
our association has doubled in size.

342
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,530
The variety of goods also increased.

343
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,619
Everyone knows

344
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,779
about these accomplishments.

345
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,210
We should elect Amita

346
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,170
as leader.

347
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,459
When Su was leader

348
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,219
in the earlier years,

349
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,970
we're friends with Tang people.

350
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,050
We never need
to watch their moods to do business.

351
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,450
But in recent years,

352
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,770
the association's direction
has changed.

353
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,099
But we Hu merchants

354
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,210
do business on Tang territory,

355
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,219
how can we avoid Tang people

356
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,090
and mind our own business?

357
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,579
The association exists

358
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,490
to safeguard
the Hu merchants' interests.

359
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,619
This direction

360
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,170
will never change.

361
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,810
The leader

362
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,050
speaks as beautifully as a singing bird.

363
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,930
Su.

364
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,290
What wind brought you here?

365
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,810
An evil wind.

366
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,210
A demonic wind.

367
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,050
The wind of stealing.

368
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,730
The wind of robbery.

369
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,699
Sounds like

370
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,330
your stance has changed.

371
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,619
I remember

372
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,210
you loved to say
that harmony brings wealth.

373
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,930
How come you're so hostile

374
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,370
after not meeting for a few years?

375
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,970
We haven't met for a few years.

376
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,090
You're also completely different.

377
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,730
You changed with each new day.

378
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,090
All our old friends are here.

379
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,290
Tell me

380
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,610
why you stole my Benzoin.

381
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,490
You can misuse idioms,

382
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,410
but watch your mouth.

383
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,850
You said I stole your spices.

384
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,610
Do you have any evidence?

385
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,650
Leader!

386
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,850
Leader.

387
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,290
Su sent someone to forcibly intercept our spices
and insisted that they're his.

388
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:35,619
Tell me why my spices
has just disappeared,

389
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,810
and your spices

390
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,690
appeared on the market.

391
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,130
Is this what they call

392
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,250
there's no story without a coincidence?

393
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,690
Su.

394
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,770
You've been gone for too long.

395
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,499
You no longer

396
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,659
monopolize the spice business.

397
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,370
My spices are stored
in double-layer urns.

398
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,530
In Lingnan,

399
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,050
only my family

400
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,210
has double-layer urns.

401
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,250
Amita.

402
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,290
Do you dare to open the box?

403
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,650
Whether it's Su Liang's goods

404
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,819
will be clear

405
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,659
and obvious.

406
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,170
The truth can be revealed.

407
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,930
Leader.

408
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,330
Get our goods.

409
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:28,530
(Village Warehouse)

410
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,250
Double-layer urns.

411
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,610
Double-layer urns.

412
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,850
I'll put litchis in this

413
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,890
and pour water outside.

414
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,570
A unified double-layer.
Stable under motion.

415
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,850
These are good urns.

416
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,370
Good urns.

417
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,290
Who is it?

418
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,490
What are you doing here?

419
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,770
I want to buy urns.

420
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,379
I'm not selling these urns.

421
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,570
Leave.

422
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,490
Let me introduce myself.

423
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,570
I'm the Litchi Envoy
appointed by His Majesty.

424
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,139
I'm in charge of transporting litchis.

425
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,850
What Litchi Envoy?

426
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,210
What does it have to do with me?

427
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,659
Litchi Envoy.
It doesn't matter what envoy you are.

428
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,899
I'm telling you.

429
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,299
I'm not selling these urns.

430
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,419
Next time

431
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,850
you want to go out

432
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,139
and flaunt your authority,

433
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,699
ask around and find out
their background first.

434
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,379
Be careful, or you'll lose your job

435
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,130
and regret it forever.

436
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,210
I'll be burning incense in gratitude

437
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,690
if I can step down from this job.

438
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,690
Are you provoking me?

439
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,130
No.

440
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,379
- Do you think I can't make you lose your job?
- Who's disturbing my rest?

441
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,570
Wait here.

442
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,139
Captain Yang.

443
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,330
This guy.

444
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,299
I'm

445
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,059
the Litchi Envoy
appointed by His Majesty!

446
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,570
(Litchi Bureau)
Shut up!

447
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,779
Look.

448
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,139
A ninth-rank official

449
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,259
flaunting his authority
like he's a prime minister.

450
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,450
This...

451
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,579
Envoy Li.

452
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,770
Captain Yang.

453
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,330
It's fate.

454
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,899
Su.

455
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,210
You'd better watch carefully.

456
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,370
This isn't your double-layer urn.

457
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,739
It's not my double-layer urn,

458
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,650
but it's my Benzoin.

459
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,179
After sailing thousands of miles by sea,
the fragrance does not fade

460
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,419
and maintain

461
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,810
80% quality.

462
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,859
Except for me,

463
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,210
who in Lingnan

464
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,930
can do it?

465
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,570
Amita.

466
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,579
You

467
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,250
replaced my double-layer urn

468
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,450
and stole my Benzoin.

469
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,859
Su, you're my elder.

470
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,050
That's why I let you open the box
and inspect the goods.

471
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,610
It would be disappointing

472
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,050
if you shamelessly frame me.

473
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,050
If that's the case,

474
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,939
don't blame me

475
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,530
for not giving you face.

476
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,170
What can you do to me?

477
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,170
I'm not selling

478
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,410
these urns.

479
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,210
What can you do?

480
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,530
I'll raise the price.

481
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,370
Alright.

482
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,650
One urn is ten guan.

483
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:42,819
No.

484
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,610
You're taking advantage
of the situation.

485
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,970
Are you buying it?

486
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,819
Well...

487
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,050
I'm not selling it anymore.

488
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,970
Don't be mad.

489
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,730
It's just one setback.

490
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,059
Think

491
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,050
about how you treated me last time?

492
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,299
I went

493
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,130
to collect the debt with the deed.

494
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,299
I was about to get the litchi garden,

495
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,379
yet you appeared

496
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,139
and made it the imperial litchi garden

497
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,930
with a wave of the hand.

498
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,419
You turned my deed

499
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,290
into a piece of waste paper.

500
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,579
You didn't give me

501
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,290
any face.

502
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,810
Didn't I tell you?

503
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,019
If you've got schemes,

504
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,050
go to Chang'an
and scheme against His Majesty.

505
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,899
All bark

506
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,099
and no bite.

507
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,579
Collect debts from His Majesty?

508
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,330
I don't have a death wish!

509
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,410
I rather smash the urns

510
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,330
than sell you one.

511
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,299
You picked up

512
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,499
the cargo ship at the port

513
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,290
with a travel pass.

514
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,210
May I ask

515
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,250
where you got your pass from?

516
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,859
Inspector's Office recently
only gave Litchi Envoy a blank pass

517
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,499
for the transportation of litchis.

518
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,970
That's why he can pass through
without stopping and getting taxed.

519
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,819
Su.

520
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,059
You privately dealt this

521
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,010
with Litchi Envoy.

522
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,659
You used to be

523
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,330
the leader of Hu Merchants' Association.

524
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,770
You should know

525
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,850
Hu merchants who broke the rules

526
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,370
will be expelled from Lingnan.

527
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,210
You broke the rules today.

528
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,650
Shouldn't you set an example?

529
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,130
If you're not selling, I'm not buying!

530
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,090
I declare....

531
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,859
Imperial edict.

532
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,379
(Litchi Envoy's Dispatch Imperial Edict)
I declare all double-layer urns in this warehouse

533
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,379
are hereby requisitioned
as imperial urns,

534
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,979
specializing in the transportation
of tribute litchis to the north.

535
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,690
These are imperial litchi urns.

536
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,979
You scoffed at His Majesty.

537
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,619
Alright.

538
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,099
With me here today,

539
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,659
If you smash another double-layer urn,

540
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,240
you're messing with His Majesty. Understand?

541
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,800
(Litchi Envoy's Dispatch Imperial Edict)

542
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,099
I sold half of my property

543
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,379
to return to Lingnan.

544
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,450
I just want to do my own business.

545
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,250
I'm not a threat to you.

546
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,339
But you

547
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,259
want to control me

548
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,650
and strangle me.

549
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,130
You leave me with nowhere to go,
becoming your prey.

550
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,539
You're young

551
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,619
and beautiful,

552
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,339
but you're too heartless

553
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,770
and twisted.

554
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,179
Letting you lead

555
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,850
is a tragedy and a disgrace

556
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,210
for the Hu merchants!

557
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,290
The Hu merchants' future

558
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,330
will never be bright!

559
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,970
Su.

560
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,170
This is not the place
for you to act recklessly.

561
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,120
Leader.

562
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,099
Litchi Envoy found the double-layer urn
and requisitioned them for imperial use.

563
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,290
Litchi Envoy?

564
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,619
- What should we do now?
- Su Liang!

565
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,810
Let's listen to Su.

566
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,459
Do you really want

567
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,290
to do honest business?

568
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,770
Of course.

569
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,970
Su Liang's goods were not lost.

570
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,610
What did you say?

571
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,050
Have you forgotten

572
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,010
that your goods were already unloaded

573
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,290
and stored in the warehouse
in the western suburbs?

574
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,370
My goods

575
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,530
were unloaded

576
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,330
and stored in a warehouse
in the western suburbs?

577
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,859
I...

578
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,250
I forgot.

579
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,899
My subordinate

580
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,650
did tell me

581
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,379
I needed to find a warehouse

582
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,890
which is in the western suburbs.

583
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,659
I forgot.

584
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,890
I forgot all about it.

585
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,659
It's a misunderstanding.

586
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,850
It's a misunderstanding.

587
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,850
I

588
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,450
apologize.

589
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,539
Su.

590
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,370
Now that the misunderstanding's sorted,

591
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,810
it just so happens that all five elders
of the association are here today.

592
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,810
Let us

593
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,379
welcome Su back.

594
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,179
Alright.

595
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,219
Welcome back, Su.

596
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,330
- Welcome back, Su.
- Welcome back, Su.

597
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,130
What are you doing here?

598
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,090
Amita.

599
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,890
Don't bother with Su Liang.

600
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,379
Even if he comes back,

601
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,619
he can never shake

602
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,739
your position as leader.

603
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,779
You shouldn't

604
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,130
call me by my name.

605
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,570
Leader.

606
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,010
Sorry.

607
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,330
Do you think I care about Su Liang?

608
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,419
I'm just curious

609
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,339
about Litchi Envoy.

610
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,250
I wanted to buy a litchi garden.

611
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,770
He turned that litchi garden
into an imperial estate.

612
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,810
He ruined a lot of stuff for me.

613
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,170
People like him

614
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,610
should be thrown into the sea
to feed sharks.

615
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,779
Who cares if he's Litchi Envoy?

616
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,419
We Hu merchants aren't afraid.

617
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,139
Let's make sure

618
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,490
he can never block your way again.

619
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,930
You can handle this then.

620
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,219
Me? I'm just

621
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,779
giving you some advice.

622
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,459
When did

623
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,139
we Hu merchants

624
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,330
become so barbaric?

625
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,450
It's all my fault.

626
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,290
Let me host a banquet to make amends.

627
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,499
I wonder if you would

628
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,970
give me this opportunity.

629
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,690
Mr. Hadi.

630
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,699
Leader is in a bad mood today.

631
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,130
You should leave.

632
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,450
Mr. Hadi, this way, please.

633
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,770
Let's do it another day then.

634
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,930
I'll host another banquet

635
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,410
when you're in a good mood.

636
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,930
Farewell.

637
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,290
Leader.

638
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,179
This Hadi is really

639
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,779
annoying and irritating.

640
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,259
No.

641
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,539
Who gave him the confidence
to think he's worthy of you?

642
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,730
Enough.

643
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,250
The leadership change is next month.

644
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,139
These old Hu merchants

645
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,930
all have ulterior motives.

646
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,690
Su Liang came back today.

647
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,010
I need someone like him

648
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,690
to help me control the situation.

649
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,450
It's late,

650
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,050
and Mr. Li hasn't come back.

651
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,139
How about

652
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,250
I go out and buy medicine for you?

653
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,970
Wait a little longer.

654
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,290
He should be back soon.

655
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,659
Don't mention it.

656
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,579
I just

657
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,650
got lucky today.

658
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,490
I didn't expect

659
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:05,210
the leader of Hu Merchants' Association
to act like a robber.

660
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,379
Well...

661
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,210
Does the government not care about this?

662
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,530
You don't know

663
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,179
that Amita's father,

664
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,259
Haihu,

665
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,699
was originally

666
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,210
a robber at sea.

667
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,570
Now,

668
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,379
her adoptive father, He Youguang,

669
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,410
Inspector He,

670
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,210
has gotten involved
with Right Chancellor.

671
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:29,610
Tough times
are waiting for Hu merchants.

672
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,170
Isn't this collusion
between officials and merchants?

673
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,650
Su.

674
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,450
I just got lucky today,

675
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,939
but I still helped you.

676
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,979
Of course.

677
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,899
Then,

678
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,179
can you give me

679
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,810
your double-layer urns?

680
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,450
You can take whatever you like.

681
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,050
Thank you, Su.

682
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,499
Your kindness to me

683
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,899
is as heavy as a mountain.

684
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,899
My reward

685
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,890
is as light as a goose feather.

686
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,170
It's not worth mentioning.

687
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,299
It's insignificant.

688
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,899
Are you being polite

689
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,819
or speaking the truth?

690
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,179
Of course it's the truth.

691
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,050
If it's the truth, then...

692
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,459
can you

693
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,370
give me some more money?

694
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,619
It's not a gift.

695
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,810
It's an investment.

696
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,810
- It's an investment.
- Investment.

697
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,330
What's investment?

698
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,890
You and I are in agreement.

699
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,650
Here, eat.

700
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,850
How has it been

701
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,250
leading the association

702
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,499
all these years?

703
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,019
All those old foxes

704
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,970
are very cunning.

705
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,579
They're not easy to deal with, right?

706
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,539
Thanks

707
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,859
to your help and guidance,

708
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,979
I learned

709
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,059
many business strategies

710
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,139
that I was able

711
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,330
to stabilize the association.

712
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,139
Alright.

713
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,330
Alright.

714
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,570
Remember.

715
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,459
If any of them bully you,

716
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,979
tell me.

717
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,210
I'll break their teeth.

718
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,090
Who would bully me?

719
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,290
Actually,

720
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,139
I've been

721
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,210
planning something lately.

722
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,290
If this plan succeeds,

723
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,059
I can officially deploy

724
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,330
Lingnan's navy.

725
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,450
By then,

726
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,410
whoever ships goods

727
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,770
by sea

728
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,650
will have to submit to me.

729
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,859
The whole Lingnan

730
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,410
will be our playground.

731
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,050
I'll be by your side,

732
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,930
helping you take care of it.

733
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,779
Sure.

734
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,970
Sure.

735
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,459
Th previous leader, Su Liang,

736
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,970
has returned to Lingnan.

737
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,859
Don't worry about him.

738
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,810
That old fox is nothing.

739
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,610
Back then,

740
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,179
I was a new official
trying to make my mark.

741
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,730
He looked down on me,

742
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,890
and won't let me touch his business.

743
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,610
So I didn't let his ship into the port.

744
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,650
Guess what happened.

745
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,779
His spice ships

746
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,530
just drifted at sea.

747
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,450
Later,

748
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,050
the typhoon came.

749
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,010
This old punk
was scared out of his wits.

750
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,330
He wanted to give in,

751
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,690
but it was too late.

752
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,899
I heard that he lost

753
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,339
more than half of his fortune

754
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,050
and went home.

755
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,699
Now,

756
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,259
the whole sea is ours.

757
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,930
Why are you afraid of him?

758
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,099
Mr. Li.

759
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,290
You're back.

760
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,010
Gou'er.

761
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,090
Medicine.

762
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,930
Ping'an.

763
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,970
Are you feeling better?

764
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,370
I bought the medicine

765
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,619
but was delayed by something

766
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,539
and left the medicine at the apothecary.

767
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,970
I'll go get it tomorrow morning.

768
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,090
You bought the medicine?

769
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,139
Yes.

770
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,330
You didn't bring it back.

771
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,210
I got delayed.

772
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,299
I finally understand

773
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,170
how my sister felt before she died.

774
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,170
Why mention your sister?

775
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,459
Can't I mention her?

776
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,810
Why mention her?

777
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,490
You don't want to admit
that you made a mistake?

778
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,779
Did my sister's death

779
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,170
not teach you a lesson?

780
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,139
You're sick.

781
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,650
Why are you so angry?

782
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,859
Alright, get some rest.

783
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,050
Come back.

784
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,539
If you can really

785
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,290
transport litchis back to Chang'an,

786
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,650
why should I stop you?

787
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,890
I want you to live.

788
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,179
You're a calculations major.

789
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,890
You can calculate everything accurately.

790
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,139
But did you expect

791
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,650
that you would be transporting litchis?

792
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,530
Did you expect that my sister would die?

793
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:08,819
Did you expect

794
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,490
that I can get this sick?

795
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,219
It's usually

796
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,339
the unforeseen factors

797
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,699
that ruin your hard work.

798
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,970
Li Shande.

799
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,610
I want you to leave.

800
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,659
I'm afraid you'll stay

801
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,930
and repeat the same mistakes.

802
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,499
The only thing

803
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,130
you'll left behind for Xiu'er is debt,
not fortune.

804
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,650
Am I staying here

805
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,770
because I want to stay here?

806
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,539
Did I take this job willingly?

807
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,819
Did I want to eat fresh litchis?

808
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,010
Is it me?

809
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,059
Don't I want to go back to Chang'an
to see Xiu'er?

810
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:42,010
Don't I want to see my daughter grow up,
get married, and live a good life?

811
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,939
She must be waiting

812
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,339
in the yard every day,
waiting for the osmanthus tree to bloom.

813
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,199
She didn't know
that the osmanthus tree is dead.

814
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,179
It can't bloom at all.

815
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,399
She doesn't know that her father is a doomed man
who won't live past the 6th month.

816
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,850
I want to stay?

817
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,099
Yes.

818
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,139
I accomplished nothing.

819
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,850
All I know is plant flowers and plants.

820
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,299
I didn't save Jinniang.

821
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,379
My colleagues deceived me

822
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,339
into taking on this job.

823
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,179
Did I do it willingly?

824
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,210
I stayed

825
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,059
because I saw

826
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,339
a glimmer of hope.

827
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,459
I want to grasp this hope

828
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,130
and go back to see Xiu'er.

829
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,450
You snapped at me.

830
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,090
Where's your hope?

831
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,890
Did you see it or touch it?

832
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,179
I'm terminally ill.

833
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,099
What if I drop dead tomorrow?
What will you do?

834
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,850
You just have a fever.
How are you dying?

835
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,690
What if I got bitten by insects and die?

836
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,659
Do you think

837
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,850
you can leave Lingnan alive?

838
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,139
We'll both die here.

839
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,059
What should Xiu'er do?
She's alone and helpless.

840
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,459
She has no one to rely on.
She'll be sold into slavery.

841
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,579
Where do we get the nerve

842
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,010
to face my sister, Li Shande?

843
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,899
Stop arguing.

844
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,800
- None of your business!
- None of your business!

845
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,450
There's a survivor here.

846
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,210
Tell me where they went.

847
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,930
Chase.

848
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,259
Who is it?

849
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,210
After the rain in the empty mountains,
a fisherman sits by the Canglang waters.

850
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,899
It's one of ours.

851
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,090
Open the door.

852
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,730
The interception failed.

853
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,970
The new envoy entered Lingnan.

854
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,699
I came to inform you

855
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,779
to make a decision soon.

856
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,819
Didn't they send elite soldiers?

857
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,379
How did he

858
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,930
fight his way out alone?

859
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,139
From the way he fights,

860
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,730
he seems to have come from the army.

861
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,090
He's ruthless,
and every strike is lethal.

862
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,330
The assassins Konglang paid handsomely

863
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,979
sieged him several times

864
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,690
but were all killed.

865
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,090
When I arrived with my men,

866
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,010
all that was left
was a field of corpses.

867
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,890
That means

868
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,090
I will be exposed.

869
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,890
You still have a chance.

870
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,810
Please offer me your advice.

871
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,579
I rode all the way back,

872
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,699
and the spies along the way

873
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,570
didn't find any trace of him.

874
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,890
This person
must have taken the mountain road

875
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,490
to escape pursuit.

876
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,099
You probably still have time

877
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,930
to complete Left Chancellor's task.

878
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,570
Even you are no match for him,

879
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,530
wouldn't it be suicide
for me to go there?

880
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,650
What...

881
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,370
What if I give up?

882
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,210
If you give up halfway,

883
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,610
Master Konglang

884
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,330
will never let you

885
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,890
leave Lingnan.

886
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,610
Qilang.

887
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,539
We're here for Chief Scribe Zhao.

888
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,699
Mr. Ma is here.

889
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,539
This way.

890
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,730
Guiyun.

891
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,290
Come here.

892
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,890
Xinmin.

893
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,410
Sorry for disturbing you

894
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,410
so early.

895
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,770
No need for formalities

896
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,250
between us.

897
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,259
What?

898
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,450
It's so early in the morning.

899
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,290
It's about our deal, of course.

900
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,619
Calm down.

901
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,939
Calm down.

902
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,459
You don't know

903
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,619
that Litchi Envoy and I

904
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,170
live in the same inn.

905
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,690
I spy on him every day.

906
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,139
He's always fiddling with litchis.

907
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,339
He doesn't eat or drink,

908
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,730
studying every day.

909
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,299
He seems to be seriously overseeing

910
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,770
the litchi transport.

911
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,490
He's not with Left Chancellor.

912
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,930
Since

913
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,450
you carefully observed him,

914
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,490
we worried too much then.

915
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,179
Here.

916
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:58,699
Here.

917
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,739
Take a piece.

918
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,619
Try it.

919
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,259
I can't eat.

920
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:02,979
It's alright.

921
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,410
This is Lingnan's specialty.

922
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,410
This is Lingnan, not Chang'an.

923
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,499
Even the biggest issue

924
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,450
have to wait until after breakfast.

925
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:11,939
Gou'er.

926
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,130
Have one too.

927
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,530
No, don't give it to him.

928
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,259
Since all concerns are cleared,

929
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,850
let's proceed with the deal.

930
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,179
I brought them all.

931
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,739
No.

932
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,099
Listen to me.

933
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,690
He tore it up.

934
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,930
Tore?

935
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,490
He tore it up?

936
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,730
How could he tear it up?

937
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,450
Write another one.

938
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,770
He's not here.

939
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,810
Not here?

940
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,530
Where did he go?

941
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,539
Take a look.

942
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,010
This chicken is as strong as an ox.

943
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,899
Guiyun.

944
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,010
It's useless even if you go
to the cockfighting arena.

945
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,159
He loves cockfighting.

946
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:02,860
When he's at the cockfighting arena,
he won't deal with official matters

947
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,959
even if the sky is falling.

948
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:05,019
Ridiculous.

949
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,890
Is the fish tally that can rule an area

950
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,859
less important to Inspector He

951
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,379
than cockfighting?

952
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,330
Authentic red crown general.

953
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,690
Not bad.

954
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,619
Ordinary people
wouldn't dare raise these chickens.

955
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,979
Just looking at mine

956
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,250
costs money!

957
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,970
The fish tally

958
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,299
is more important, of course.

959
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,139
But

960
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,979
once Inspector He
enter the cockfighting arena,

961
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,890
he's no longer Inspector He.

962
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,539
Who is he then?

963
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,090
Silence, please!

964
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,570
Alright!

965
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,770
Chicken Daddy.

966
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,330
What is Daddy?

967
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,810
It means father.

968
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,370
Chicken Father?

969
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,530
(Inspector's Office)

970
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,610
(Inspector's Office)

971
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,059
=The Litchi Road=

972
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,410
Inspector He.

973
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,970
Guiyun.

974
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,010
Here.

975
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,179
Report!

976
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,219
Report!

977
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,610
Report!

978
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,250
Even the most urgent matters

979
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,210
aren't as important as our deal.

980
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,659
I'll ask Right Chancellor's envoy

981
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,850
to wait first then.

982
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,530
Right Chancellor's envoy?

983
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,210
Let's check it out.

984
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,410
