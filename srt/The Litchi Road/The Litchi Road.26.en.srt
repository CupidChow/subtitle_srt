1
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,999
=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,940
(A Big Black Carp)

3
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,140
(Ten Years Ago)

4
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,200
- Hello.
- I can walk. Let go!

5
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,700
- You two...
- Ask Chief to be the judge.

6
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,540
Chief is here.

7
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,610
Chief, look.

8
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,180
- Chief, look.
- How insolent.

9
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,020
Stop.

10
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,820
Who are you?

11
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,740
He's new.

12
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,380
The academic division's Li...

13
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,955
The mathematics division's Li Shande.

14
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,740
Instead of being on duty
at Leyou Garden,

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,444
why are you back at Shanglin Office?

16
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,940
- He put poison.
- Nonsense.

17
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,977
- Poison? Don't talk nonsense.
- You put poison.

18
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,900
Chief.

19
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,740
Today,
we went to Leyou Garden to release fish.

20
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,580
I just got the basin

21
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,500
off the cart.

22
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,460
When I turned around,

23
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,660
I saw scattered leaves

24
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,380
floating in the water.

25
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,733
They're Chinese toon shoots!

26
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,540
It's harmless to humans

27
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,660
but deadly to fish.

28
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,820
Carps

29
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,220
are different from other fish.

30
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,420
When carps

31
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,820
see something moving on the water,

32
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,090
they'll jump up and take a bite.

33
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,060
People don't understand.

34
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,577
That's why there's the saying
"a carp leaping over the dragon gate".

35
00:02:37,577 --> 00:02:38,300
Alright.

36
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,140
Chief.

37
00:02:39,377 --> 00:02:41,866
Uphold justice for me, Chief.

38
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,022
Uphold justice for me too.

39
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:04,780
It must be your fault.
You want to poison these carps

40
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,700
and

41
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,940
ask Shanglin Office to buy new carps.

42
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,530
You'll then benefit from it.

43
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,088
I ask for your wise judgment.

44
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,580
This is slander.

45
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,100
Alright.

46
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,100
If it's true,

47
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:16,280
you'll be punished severely.

48
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,100
If you accused Supervisor Song wrongly,

49
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,844
you'll be fined one month's pay.

50
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,100
One month?

51
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,580
One...

52
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,940
One month is...

53
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,540
You two.

54
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,060
Why get upset

55
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,220
over a carp?

56
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,620
This guy

57
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,380
just joined Shanglin Office.

58
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,888
He doesn't know the rules yet.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,980
He's young and impulsive.
I can understand that.

60
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,380
How about you both meet halfway?

61
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,100
Forget it.

62
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,460
Liangyuan.

63
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,660
Calm down.

64
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,540
I

65
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,620
shouldn't have

66
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,060
hit you today.

67
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,900
Here.

68
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,380
These two Songjiang perches

69
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,140
are my apology.

70
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,740
No, Songjiang perch
is a specialty of Huating County.

71
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,822
None on the market
is supplied to Eastern Palace.

72
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,180
Is this
from Shanglin Office's ice storage?

73
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,149
It is said
that Shanglin Office's ice storage

74
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,460
is all fruits and vegetables
from various prefectures.

75
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:20,980
They're all very precious,

76
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,820
especially...

77
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,620
I'm of low ranking.

78
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,155
I dare not eat.

79
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,620
I ask for your wise judgment.

80
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,220
If I falsely accuse him,

81
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:41,022
I'm willing to be fined
one month's salary.

82
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,940
Chief.

83
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,060
If it is found that I did it,

84
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:46,000
I will also accept the punishment.

85
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:48,940
Chief, you can't drink.

86
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,020
You just ate a golden peach.

87
00:04:51,177 --> 00:04:52,600
Golden peach is warm in nature.

88
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:53,666
If you mix both,

89
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,700
it'll be heaty.

90
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,980
Chief Liu.

91
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,020
Chief Liu.

92
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,580
Chief.

93
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,300
Chief.

94
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,580
Just now,

95
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,020
we took the fish out

96
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,540
and found that it was alive.

97
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,620
It's not dead.

98
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,700
No way.

99
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,020
It's absolutely true.

100
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,180
Look.

101
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,100
Liangyuan.

102
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,380
Maybe you really saw it wrong.

103
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,220
I don't blame you.

104
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,780
But

105
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,180
I'm afraid you can't escape

106
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,340
the one-month salary fine

107
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,060
set by Chief Liu.

108
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,460
This isn't the fish.

109
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,466
- This is the fish.
- This is the fish.

110
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,740
=Episode 26=

111
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,540
I bought some hubings
for you and Xiu'er.

112
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,900
I didn't expect you to be at home.

113
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:21,020
Did the approval process
not go smoothly?

114
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,820
Those in intellectual work rule others.

115
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,740
Those in labor work are ruled by others.

116
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,700
I now understand

117
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,980
how did those in intellectual work

118
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,580
do their work?

119
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,580
Officialdom is like the sea.

120
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,500
Bad swimmers like me

121
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,420
will either drown

122
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,340
or be killed by fish.

123
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,460
If I had known this,

124
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,380
I should have lined my pockets.

125
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,700
Why transport litchis?

126
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,180
You didn't do that

127
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,711
because you're different
from other officials.

128
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,780
You have a conscience.

129
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,300
I have a conscience?

130
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,100
What's the use of having a conscience?

131
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,740
I act with my conscience.

132
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:13,060
What did I get in return?

133
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,777
I keep running into obstacles.

134
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,060
I should be like

135
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,940
those officials.

136
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,140
Have no conscience.

137
00:07:21,444 --> 00:07:23,600
I should do my best
to line my own pockets

138
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:24,244
and make money.

139
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,380
At least I can take good care

140
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,260
of my daughter.

141
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,180
Stop saying these discouraging words.

142
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:32,100
There are many people in Lingnan

143
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,980
who care about you.

144
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,340
You should do them right.

145
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,900
Who's going to do me right then?

146
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,420
Transporting litchis

147
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,540
is next to impossible.

148
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,420
Why

149
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,700
do you all

150
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,300
try to stop me?

151
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,500
He Youguang was willing to kill me.

152
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,820
Alright, we got to Chang'an.

153
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,100
We couldn't submit the petition.

154
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,060
The transport strategy

155
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,300
was tricked out of me.

156
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,940
Why?

157
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,580
Why are people

158
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,460
more vicious than wolves?

159
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:07,660
Am I the one who wants to eat litchis?

160
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,860
Am I who wants it?

161
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,511
It's His Majesty who wants to eat it.

162
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,420
It's Right Chancellor.

163
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,700
It's Right Chancellor's sister!

164
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,060
His sister wants to eat it!

165
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,140
I worked so hard

166
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,422
to put myself in this situation.

167
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,260
Why?

168
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,066
You don't need to persuade me.

169
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:31,490
No need to persuade me. I understand.

170
00:08:36,488 --> 00:08:38,080
Are you not transporting litchis
anymore?

171
00:08:38,088 --> 00:08:38,740
No.

172
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,100
No one will help me.

173
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:42,580
What can we transport?

174
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,340
What can we do?

175
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,980
I'm at my wit's end,

176
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,500
with no way out.

177
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,820
Forget it.

178
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,580
In the past few months,

179
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,340
it feels like there's a big rock
pressing on my chest,

180
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,600
making it hard to breathe.

181
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,420
I just took advantage
of my daughter's absence

182
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,380
to vent some steam.

183
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:15,666
Sorry to make a fool of myself.

184
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,620
How could I laugh at you?

185
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,220
When I lost my status as leader

186
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,300
and everyone around me
turned against me,

187
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,620
I didn't know

188
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,060
how I could fight against He Youguang

189
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,140
and avenge my father.

190
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,540
But you managed

191
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,580
to revive

192
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,180
a hopeless task.

193
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,500
I didn't give up because of you.

194
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:52,220
I met Deputy Director Lu a few days ago.

195
00:09:53,222 --> 00:09:54,460
He didn't say it explicitly,

196
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,340
but I knew

197
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,620
I would be useless

198
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,660
before I got evidence,

199
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,820
even if I came to Chang'an.

200
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,220
But I won't give up.

201
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,300
I want to return to Lingnan

202
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,620
and personally get evidence.

203
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,340
I ask you not to give up either.

204
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,044
What brings you here?

205
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,740
I thought about it.

206
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,580
I decided to return to Lingnan

207
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,740
and help Yun Qing get evidence.

208
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,260
Lingnan?

209
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,500
Lingnan is He Youguang's territory.

210
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,940
If you go back, won't you

211
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,222
be walking straight
into the tiger's den?

212
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,660
I still have to protect you.

213
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,820
I thought of a foolproof plan.

214
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,340
If I return to Lingnan under the pretext

215
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:12,888
of running the litchi transport,

216
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,940
I will be working for His Majesty.

217
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,820
He Youguang won't kill me.

218
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,622
You want to be involved
in Litchi Envoy's transport?

219
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,340
I had fallen out with He Youguang

220
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,420
because of my father,

221
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,488
so I wanted to use this opportunity

222
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:29,333
to get an identity
that could avoid death.

223
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,700
But Litchi Envoy is being pushed back
and forth by all the government offices,

224
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,180
unable to get official approval.

225
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:35,900
This plan can't be carried out yet,

226
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,980
So I would like to ask
Deputy Director Lu

227
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,580
to help him out.

228
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,620
Right Chancellor

229
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,133
is holding a grand birthday banquet
for Noble Consort.

230
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,420
Its scale is unprecedented.

231
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,540
He prepared
rare treasures from overseas,

232
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,140
intending to impress everyone

233
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,488
at the birthday banquet.

234
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,620
Lingnan's litchis

235
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,540
just happens to be a rare commodity

236
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,300
that he was in charge of.

237
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,260
If you help Litchi Envoy

238
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,740
transport litchis into Chang'an,

239
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,700
we'll be helping Right Chancellor

240
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,340
steal the show.

241
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,940
The litchis' arrival

242
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,100
is nothing but icing on the cake

243
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,260
for Right Chancellor.

244
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:16,620
But if it can't be transported,

245
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,420
Litchi Envoy will die.

246
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,020
Litchi Envoy

247
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,340
was a minor official in Shanglin Office.

248
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,580
He's honest and loyal.

249
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,340
He took this doomed task

250
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,180
because he was tricked.

251
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,660
He never pocketed any money
when he was in Lingnan.

252
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,860
He only focused
on transporting litchis,

253
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,180
hoping to survive

254
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,620
and live his own life.

255
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,533
We want to overthrow Right Chancellor

256
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,260
so that

257
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,820
no more innocent people

258
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,100
will have to suffer like him.

259
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,180
If we stand by

260
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,500
and watch him die,

261
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,060
how are we different

262
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,300
from the rich and powerful people

263
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,600
who trample on human lives?

264
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,340
What are your chances of success

265
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,100
after your return to Lingnan?

266
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,140
I thought of someone.

267
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,580
He must have

268
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,177
evidence of He Youguang's corruption.

269
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,380
Master Konglang

270
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,720
can't make a move on this person,

271
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,460
but I'm very confident

272
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,777
in making him change sides.

273
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,940
Recently,

274
00:13:27,444 --> 00:13:29,511
I went to Konglang Bookstore
to buy information

275
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,300
and ran into Ma Guiyun.

276
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:33,900
Was he also there to buy information?

277
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,380
It's not that simple.

278
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,820
He held

279
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,180
a pink round fan.

280
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,100
It's obvious

281
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,060
that it's a gift for a lady.

282
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,380
But the only female member

283
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,620
of Konglang Bookstore

284
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,020
is Master Konglang
who never showed herself.

285
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,900
So Ma Guiyun wants to pursue

286
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,340
Master Konglang?

287
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,540
Why are you so worked up

288
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,620
about love affairs?

289
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,900
Are you jealous?

290
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,140
Don't talk nonsense.

291
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,940
All you see is love affairs.

292
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,980
Have you ever thought

293
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,020
that if they had
this kind of relationship,

294
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,140
he would not only have known

295
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,940
all the information I bought,

296
00:14:18,311 --> 00:14:20,420
but the information
Master Konglang replied to me

297
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,380
may also not be completely true?

298
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,140
This is complicated.

299
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,860
Unfathomable.

300
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,540
I doubt

301
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,860
he's not

302
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,340
Ma Guiyun,
the envoy sent by Right Chancellor.

303
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,940
Ping'an?

304
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,740
Yes.

305
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,580
I arrived at Lingnan smoothly.

306
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,180
Why are you here too?

307
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,933
How could it be such a coincidence

308
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,700
that Pan Bao, who met Ma Guiyun,

309
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,740
died in Chang'an?

310
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,260
26 days ago?

311
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,660
Pan Bao died?

312
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,460
How come I didn't receive any news?

313
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,300
The new envoy Right Chancellor sent

314
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,140
died before he could finish speaking.

315
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,260
You...

316
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,060
You're not...

317
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,311
It's not that I won't go back.

318
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,260
I really can't go back.

319
00:15:16,177 --> 00:15:17,980
The only person
who can prove his identity

320
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,540
is Master Konglang.

321
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,580
But why did he

322
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,700
impersonate Ma Guiyun?

323
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,140
For money.

324
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,220
It's not a big deal if it's for money.

325
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,500
I suspect

326
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,180
he doesn't work for Right Chancellor

327
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,500
but Left Chancellor.

328
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,820
The only person

329
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,020
who can compete with Right Chancellor
in the court

330
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,180
is Left Chancellor.

331
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,500
Gosh.

332
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,500
You're clever.

333
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,420
You saw through Chang'an's affairs

334
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,300
so thoroughly.

335
00:16:02,777 --> 00:16:04,288
But why did Left Chancellor

336
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,380
send him to Lingnan?

337
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,980
Maybe it was to bring down He Youguang,

338
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,300
thus implicating
the downfall of Right Chancellor.

339
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,660
This is...

340
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,660
A big deal.

341
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,580
Why don't you

342
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,088
report this to He Youguang right away?

343
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,244
I can't interfere.

344
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:33,266
Or we'd be in the same boat
as He Youguang.

345
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,260
I didn't know

346
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,620
he killed Haihu.

347
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,740
He was so cruel to his brother

348
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,444
who had been through everything
with him,

349
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:42,822
let alone me?

350
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,220
The innocent suffer

351
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,460
when others battle.

352
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,580
You're the chief scribe
at Inspector's Office.

353
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,688
When the reckoning starts,

354
00:16:54,733 --> 00:16:56,020
you're bound to be involved.

355
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,380
Well...

356
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,620
What should we do?

357
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,300
Don't worry.

358
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,820
Have you hidden

359
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,540
all the evidence I asked you to collect?

360
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,500
Don't worry.

361
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,380
I did. They're safe and sound.

362
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,380
That's good.

363
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,460
It can save us

364
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,420
at the critical moment.

365
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,300
If...

366
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,580
If I'm not wrong

367
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,860
about Ma Guiyun's identity,

368
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,420
everything will fall apart.

369
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,500
He Youguang.

370
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,940
All these years, I worked so hard

371
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,860
managing Inspector's Office,

372
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,460
but he treated me like a slave

373
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,060
and humiliated me at will.

374
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,060
Now,

375
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,100
don't blame me
for trying to protect myself.

376
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,500
I was impulsive.

377
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,500
I negotiated with Zhao Xinmin.

378
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,780
I should be able to get away with it.

379
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,140
You've been exposed.

380
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,580
Zhao Xinmin

381
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,260
used to sell Sea Sail Fund in Lingnan.

382
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,100
He moves seamlessly
among people from all walks of life.

383
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,380
He's best at reading people.

384
00:18:17,755 --> 00:18:18,940
The fact that he has been able

385
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,180
to become He Youguang's chief scribe
over the years

386
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,980
shows that he's more cunning
than others.

387
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,940
If he doesn't believe you,

388
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,355
you can just go back to Chang'an.

389
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,500
He doesn't believe me now.

390
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,660
Today,

391
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,780
if he wants Amita's whereabouts,

392
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,740
he won't believe me,

393
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,900
no matter what I tell him.

394
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,100
I was careless.

395
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,380
How should I make up for it?

396
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,940
Forget it.

397
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,740
I'll handle Zhao Xinmin.

398
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,420
Stop for a moment.

399
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,500
Before Tu died,

400
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,780
he said he had evidence

401
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,355
of He Youguang buying fire oil.

402
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,020
If we can get the evidence
as soon as possible,

403
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:53,060
we don't need to worry

404
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,500
about these trivial matters anymore.

405
00:18:54,577 --> 00:18:56,422
Have you found
the whereabouts of the evidence?

406
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,900
Luotuo.

407
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,780
Let's go.

408
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,620
I checked it once.

409
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,380
Tu probably gave the evidence

410
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,460
to his childhood sweetheart, Chai.

411
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,260
Chai?

412
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,800
She's also a member of Dong people.

413
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,580
Tell your master

414
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,780
that I will

415
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,060
investigate this myself.

416
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,200
Who's discussing me behind my back?

417
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,180
Gou'er.

418
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,980
Get some water for the ladies.

419
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:29,980
Alright.

420
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,220
Alright.

421
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,420
Since you're sincere,

422
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,100
I'll help you ask around.

423
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,460
Why is there no news from Li Shande

424
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,860
since he returned to Chang'an?

425
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,711
Is he still transporting litchis?

426
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,980
Of course he is.

427
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,300
He must be dealing with the transport

428
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,220
in Chang'an.

429
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,980
Don't worry. He's always thinking

430
00:19:56,177 --> 00:19:58,244
about the litchi garden and you.

431
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,860
I wondered

432
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,020
why I sneezed.

433
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,266
Turns out that Li Shande is missing me.

434
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,060
Sir, how much is this?

435
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,100
Ten coins a piece.

436
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,660
How expensive.

437
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,220
I can buy a few hubings with that price.

438
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,420
Why don't you buy hubings?

439
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,940
Being able to open

440
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,100
a pastry shop in Pingkang Ward

441
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,620
means I'm pretty skilled.

442
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,220
The Suxiang biscuits you picked

443
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,340
are unique in Chang'an.

444
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,940
It's only available in my shop.

445
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,300
The crust is crispy and soft

446
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,511
with a meat filling inside.

447
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,940
It's sweet and salty.

448
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,900
Hubing is just maltose candy.

449
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,300
You can also taste this.

450
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,260
If you say so,

451
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,180
choose something else.

452
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,740
This one.

453
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:57,420
This one is more expensive
than Suxiang biscuits.

454
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,540
This one is ugly.

455
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,700
It's not suitable as a gift.

456
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,540
What about this one?

457
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,060
These are Yulu balls.

458
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,700
Yulu balls? What a good name.

459
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,580
This must be very expensive.

460
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,580
It's actually

461
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,940
the cheapest

462
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,220
among these pastries.

463
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,100
How much is it?

464
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,060
Five coins.

465
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,620
I like this.

466
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,460
If I buy five,

467
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:26,577
can you give me
the crumbled one for free?

468
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,888
How can you
give the crumbled one as a gift?

469
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,420
I'm keeping it for myself to taste.

470
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,620
Sure.

471
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,620
Supervisor Xu.

472
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,860
Litchi Envoy is here again.

473
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,577
Why are you here again?

474
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,300
Well,

475
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,500
I was just passing by

476
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,260
Pingkang Ward's pastry shop.

477
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,220
Yulu balls.

478
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,300
They're freshly made.

479
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,620
I brought this for you to try.

480
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,900
What are you doing?

481
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
Take it away.

482
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,620
Try it.

483
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,620
I'm unworthy

484
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,580
of your Yulu balls.

485
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,260
I really can't submit

486
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,660
your petition.

487
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,300
Last time,

488
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,820
I got anxious

489
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,300
and left in anger,

490
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,940
ending it in a bad mood.

491
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,700
Don't blame me.

492
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,260
I didn't see this

493
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,420
from your perspective. Don't blame me.

494
00:22:31,488 --> 00:22:33,555
I didn't come here
to submit the petition today.

495
00:22:33,622 --> 00:22:35,177
I'm just here to apologize.

496
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,620
Liangyuan.

497
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,580
Given your personality,
you're not cut out

498
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,260
to flatter others.

499
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,620
It's just a misunderstanding.

500
00:22:54,777 --> 00:22:56,140
We were classmates for three years.

501
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,060
How could I blame you for this?

502
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,580
We should blame your task.

503
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,820
Whoever gets involved
won't have it easy.

504
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,300
It's my fault

505
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:09,288
for losing my original intention.

506
00:23:09,511 --> 00:23:11,066
I've been an official for many years,

507
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,660
but I've become so cunning.

508
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,300
I'm really ashamed.

509
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,822
We both have difficulties.

510
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,780
I hope you'll forgive me.

511
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,620
It's human nature.

512
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,540
Yes, if you do this

513
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,460
for me,

514
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,780
everyone else will be asking
for favors too.

515
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,888
You'll be put on the spot.

516
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,660
I didn't come back

517
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,820
for favors.

518
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,890
I just want to inquire about something.

519
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,420
Just go ahead.

520
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,540
I heard Attendant Yu

521
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,140
was in charge of procuring items

522
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,777
for Noble Consort's birthday banquet.

523
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,140
Has he
been to Left Storage Office recently?

524
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,620
You must have heard it wrongly.

525
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,700
Attendant Yu

526
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,580
is in charge of purchasing,

527
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,020
but he didn't have

528
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,660
to personally handle

529
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,540
the trivial matters of storing.

530
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,180
The servants will handle it.

531
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,580
Liangyuan.

532
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,300
Why are you asking about Attendant Yu?

533
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,940
Hasn't he always been

534
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,220
good at transporting and purchasing?

535
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,140
He has experience.

536
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,300
I want to learn from him.

537
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,300
Do you know

538
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,820
where I can I him?

539
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,140
The items he's purchasing are so diverse

540
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,500
that he must have been traveling around

541
00:24:34,555 --> 00:24:35,733
and had no permanent home.

542
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,620
I'm afraid it's difficult

543
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,260
to see him.

544
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,900
How about this?

545
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,740
I'll tell you

546
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,020
if I meet him.

547
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:49,860
If the opportunity is right,

548
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,533
I will definitely introduce you.
How about that?

549
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,420
Thank you.

550
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,380
Liangyuan.

551
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,380
Don't misunderstand me again this time.

552
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,780
I'll stop bothering you.

553
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,260
I...

554
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,780
You can take these Yulu balls back.

555
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,700
You can keep them for yourself.

556
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,660
No need to be so polite with me
from now on.

557
00:25:16,711 --> 00:25:19,400
You're making our three years
as classmates seem like it was nothing.

558
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,260
Take it away.

559
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,700
Well...

560
00:25:23,266 --> 00:25:24,755
Well, I'll do whatever you say.

561
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,220
How about this? I...

562
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,380
I'll take a piece

563
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,820
for my daughter.

564
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,900
Keep the rest.

565
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,540
Keep the rest.

566
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,900
Attendant Yu, you

567
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,100
have been working very hard

568
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:00,155
on the purchasing matters recently.

569
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,060
You worked hard.

570
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,900
Noble Consort's birthday banquet

571
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,900
is a task

572
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,420
assigned by His Majesty.

573
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,660
Right Chancellor has entrusted me

574
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,420
with this task.

575
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,460
How can I feel at ease

576
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,044
if I don't oversee it personally?

577
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,420
Yes.

578
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,540
You're dedicated to your duties

579
00:26:25,577 --> 00:26:27,422
and are truly a role model
for our generation.

580
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,860
(Purchase List)

581
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,940
By the way,

582
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,300
a Litchi Envoy came by just now

583
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,400
to inquire about your whereabouts.

584
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,780
I don't know what he wants,

585
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,660
so I sent him away.

586
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,020
Supervisor Xu.

587
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,911
Tribute goods have been
coming and going frequently

588
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,020
in Left Storage Office recently.

589
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,860
You probably

590
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,940
haven't had a day off for a long time.

591
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,180
I hosted a dinner today

592
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,620
and invited
Ministry of War's Carriage Director

593
00:27:16,644 --> 00:27:17,800
and Ministry of Revenue's

594
00:27:17,822 --> 00:27:19,844
Bureau of General Accounts'
Chief Clerk of Affairs.

595
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,220
Do you

596
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,380
want to join us?

597
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,740
Thank you for the honor.

598
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,060
I will attend it.

599
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,300
Attendant Yu.

600
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,060
These are the Yulu balls

601
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,180
I bought from Pingkang Ward.

602
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,700
Try it.

603
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,820
Made any progress?

604
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,355
Deputy Director Lu sent me a message.

605
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,100
He said the litchi transport

606
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,460
is supervised by Right Chancellor.

607
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,149
Left Chancellor and Security Bureau

608
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,300
can't intervene, but he found

609
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,820
a way to meet Right Chancellor.

610
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,980
What?

611
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,100
The patron that Madam Shiqi mentioned

612
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,577
is Right Chancellor.

613
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,420
Madam Shiqi knows Right Chancellor?

614
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,260
Do you know if they're close?

615
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,220
But Madam Shiqi is just a common

616
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,220
moneylender.

617
00:28:50,422 --> 00:28:53,266
She probably doesn't have
any direct ties with Right Chancellor.

618
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,100
But at least
she can pass on the message.

619
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,540
Right Chancellor
is in charge of the litchis.

620
00:28:59,622 --> 00:29:01,550
It's also to celebrate
Noble Consort's birthday.

621
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,300
You've made some progress.

622
00:29:03,511 --> 00:29:05,420
Right Chancellor
has no reason not to see you.

623
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,860
But that villain is a handful.

624
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,500
Madam Shiqi has been forcing me
to pay her.

625
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,500
If I go to her,

626
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,300
it means I can't get the approval.

627
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,140
It's mainly because I'm scared

628
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,711
she'll do something to my child.

629
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,660
There's a saying among pirates.

630
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,220
When facing interests,

631
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:34,980
your enemy

632
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,660
can become your friend in the end.

633
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,300
If she really wants you to pay her,

634
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,940
she'll consider helping you.

635
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,700
Asking her is indeed the worst option,

636
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,780
but you have no other choice.

637
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,340
After days of maneuvering,

638
00:29:59,044 --> 00:30:01,555
we still have to pull teeth
from the tiger's mouth.

639
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,911
I invited all of you here today.

640
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,700
Firstly, I want to introduce you
to each other.

641
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,460
This way, you'll have support

642
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,380
in the court.

643
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,260
Secondly,

644
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,822
I want to trouble you
with a small matter.

645
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,180
Just go ahead.

646
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,860
I want to talk

647
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,100
about Litchi Envoy.

648
00:30:35,555 --> 00:30:37,222
Attendant Yu, please rest assured.

649
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,860
This person was my classmate,

650
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,220
but

651
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,860
we're not friends.

652
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,177
He submitted a petition to me.

653
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:47,700
I immediately turned against him.

654
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,980
Litchi Envoy also came
to Bureau of General Accounts.

655
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,940
I said a few words to him

656
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,980
and sent him to Hall of State Affairs

657
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,540
to bother the officials.

658
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,140
It's not necessary
to go to such lengths.

659
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,980
Litchi Envoy didn't even make it

660
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,060
to Ministry of War.

661
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,620
Litchi Envoy

662
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,500
is

663
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,355
working for His Majesty.

664
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,700
I want to tell you

665
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,300
not to push it around.

666
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,220
This approval

667
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,244
should be given to him
as soon as possible.

668
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,780
It just so happens that I brought

669
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,340
the petition he wrote today.

670
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,020
Attendant Yu.

671
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,300
It's not that I don't want to do it.

672
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,820
It's because Bureau of General Accounts

673
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,380
is responsible for Imperial Treasury.

674
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,220
We need to be extra careful.

675
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,580
Attendant Yu.

676
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,100
He and I were classmates after all.

677
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,860
I never lied to him.

678
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,540
The litchis don't need to be stored

679
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,755
after entering Chang'an.

680
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,420
The storage he needs

681
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,660
is on the way.

682
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,740
It has nothing to do

683
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,420
with Left Storage Office.

684
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,540
Attendant Yu.

685
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,620
You're also an expert
in transporting items.

686
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,540
Set aside the expensive expenses

687
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,580
from Lingnan to Chang'an first.

688
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,820
Let's just talk about litchis.

689
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,660
No matter how fresh the litchi is,

690
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,780
it will have already rotted

691
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:42,940
and stank after more
than ten days of traveling.

692
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,780
Who would believe
that he could transport them?

693
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,420
I would.

694
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,060
If you think about it,

695
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,460
litchis don't need to be stored,

696
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,580
but they're contributed by all parties.

697
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:18,140
They're indeed under the jurisdiction
of Left Storage Office.

698
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,660
Attendant Yu.

699
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,380
Litchi Envoy...

700
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,620
He...

701
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:49,955
The money and food
he needs are all clear.

702
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,420
The money he needs

703
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,740
should be allocated first.

704
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,220
We should help him with this.

705
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,340
We should help him.

706
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,340
We should help him.

707
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:09,060
I thought you invited me today

708
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,540
to make friends.

709
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:18,220
I didn't expect it to be a trap.

710
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,740
Our principles differ,
we can't work together.

711
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,580
Farewell.

712
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,220
Zhou Sanlang.

713
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,340
What brought you here?

714
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,577
Director Ma.

715
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,620
I, a member of Baiwang people,
Zhou Sanlang, greet the master.

716
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,140
Chang'an's Baiwang people

717
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:08,060
are willing to do anything for you.

718
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,755
We're at your command.

719
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,620
Director Ma.

720
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,060
We have such a large-scale

721
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,060
smuggling business.

722
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,780
If it weren't for Attendant Yu,

723
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,900
who had been helping to cover up,

724
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,900
you and I

725
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,380
would have been locked up
by Ministry of Justice long ago.

726
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,140
Of course.

727
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,100
Of course.

728
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,180
Attendant Yu.

729
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,940
The transportation of litchis

730
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,220
is under the jurisdiction
of Carriage Bureau.

731
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,380
It's my job.

732
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,180
I dare not reject.

733
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,060
Here.

734
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,060
Attendant Yu.

735
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,780
Attendant Yu.

736
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,100
(Pingkang Ward)

737
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,260
It's not difficult

738
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,380
to get approval.

739
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,700
I just need your help.

740
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,644
What does it have to do with me?

741
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,260
If we follow the procedure,

742
00:37:35,577 --> 00:37:37,940
it will take a long time
and the process will be lengthy.

743
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,860
You can't wait for this.

744
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,900
I can't wait either.

745
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,580
If we have

746
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,100
someone highly respected

747
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,180
help me get out of the procedures...

748
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:53,977
If they help me
get out of the procedures,

749
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,511
you and I will be pleased.

750
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,511
Don't beat around the bush with me.

751
00:37:59,140 --> 00:37:59,980
Just tell me

752
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,460
how I can help you.

753
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,220
I heard

754
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,620
your patrons

755
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,220
include Right Chancellor, who oversees

756
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,540
the litchi transport.

757
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,060
If I could meet him,

758
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,580
our dilemma

759
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,860
would be solved.

760
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,340
Li Shande.

761
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,580
Have you lost your mind?

762
00:38:26,711 --> 00:38:28,244
You want to see Right Chancellor?

763
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,460
I can't even see him.

764
00:38:31,555 --> 00:38:33,155
Who gave you the audacity?

765
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,660
Just help me pass on a message.

766
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,540
I'm very sure

767
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,980
that Right Chancellor wants

768
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,488
to bring litchis to His Majesty.

769
00:38:40,533 --> 00:38:41,180
He'll meet me.

770
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,820
Do you know that there are many people

771
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,060
in Pingkang Ward who want to see

772
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,940
Right Chancellor?

773
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,820
Several rooms in the ward

774
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,700
are all used to store gifts.

775
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,020
Even so,

776
00:38:53,377 --> 00:38:55,180
not many people can get what they want.

777
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,460
Do you think

778
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,700
I can help you

779
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,980
by saying a few lies?

780
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,660
I know

781
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,020
it's abrupt of me to speak so rashly.

782
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,460
Look.

783
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,300
You and me...

784
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,100
The two of us

785
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,740
are linked together because of a loan.

786
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,020
Now, my...

787
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,340
My life is at stake.

788
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:19,900
If I die,

789
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,020
won't you business...

790
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,900
You really are a math major.

791
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,500
You refused to pay me back
and eloquently

792
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:29,900
pinned the blame on me.

793
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,580
I, Madam Shiqi,

794
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,860
grew up in Pingkang Ward.

795
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,180
I've seen everything.

796
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,660
I can handle your threats.

797
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,260
I now understand

798
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,220
that you can't get the approval.

799
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,020
Hurry back and raise money.

800
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,220
If you can't pay it back,

801
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,900
don't blame me for being cruel to you.

802
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,900
Madam Shiqi.

803
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,540
I brought the deed with me.

804
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,900
This is all I own

805
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,660
and my daughter's

806
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,820
future home.

807
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,220
I know

808
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,660
I will have a way to survive

809
00:40:19,755 --> 00:40:21,177
if I can meet Right Chancellor,

810
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,900
but I don't know how.

811
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,940
If you can help me,

812
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,460
I'm willing to mortgage this deed

813
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,540
here.

814
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,180
I can't bear to see someone so pitiful.

815
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,460
I'll pass on the message for you.

816
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,460
If we get into this mess,

817
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,140
we might lose our jobs.

818
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,380
If we don't respond,

819
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,500
we'll lose our jobs immediately.

820
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,180
But I still don't understand

821
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,740
why Attendant Yu did this.

822
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,780
Could it be possible

823
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,260
that litchis
could be transported to Chang'an?

824
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,140
If there's no fish,

825
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,666
why will the turtle move?

826
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,180
There's a turtle on top

827
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,577
that will eat big fish again.

828
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,420
In that case, wait

829
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,380
at your office tomorrow.

830
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,420
Baiwang people, Feng Shiqi,

831
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,300
is here to meet the master.

832
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:33,140
=The Litchi Road=

833
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,980
Tomorrow at noon,

834
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,300
Right Chancellor
will pass through the palace corridor.

835
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,820
Whether you can make him stop for you

836
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,340
depends on your luck.

837
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,300
Shanglin Office's supervisor,

838
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,860
Litchi Envoy,

839
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,140

842
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,340
to make it happen.

843
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,420
