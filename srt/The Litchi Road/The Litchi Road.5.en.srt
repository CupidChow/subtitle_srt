00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,999
=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,420
(Song Wuji)
Has Lingnan's esteemed guest arrived?

3
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,480
Yes.

4
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,350
Hurry and greet them.

5
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,270
Yes.

6
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,030
Bet!

7
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,790
Bet!

8
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,000
This is His Majesty's blackwood.

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,920
Be careful.

10
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,640
You're dead if it falls.

11
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,240
Envoy Pan.

12
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,670
My master has waited for a long time.

13
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,280
Please.

14
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,320
Thank you.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,800
Liuzi.

16
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,230
Settle the family.

17
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,200
Sell the house.

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,940
The family is used to it
and can't bear to leave.

19
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,950
No pain, no gain.

20
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,870
Everyone.

21
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,200
Hurry and copy it down.

22
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,240
I'm afraid

23
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,520
this won't last for too long.

24
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,510
Yes.

25
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,240
(Clouds dream her robes,
and flowers envy her face.)

26
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,780
(Spring breeze blows while dew glows.)

27
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:58,910
Yes.

28
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,830
Another one.

29
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,950
Right Chancellor!

30
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:07,960
Right Chancellor.

31
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,550
Treacherous ministers like you

32
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,510
have committed many evil deeds.

33
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,790
- Heaven will punish you.
- Shut up!

34
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,977
Let him talk.

35
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,230
Don't stop him.

36
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,880
Record everything he said.

37
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,280
Yes.

38
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,550
Let him talk!

39
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,670
You slaves

40
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,910
use power

41
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,230
to commit corruption,

42
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,760
exclude opponents,

43
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,950
oppress colleagues,

44
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,920
harm the loyal and the good,

45
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,950
exploit the people,

46
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,830
trick superiors,

47
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,040
and disrupt the government!

48
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,480
You deceive His Majesty

49
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,830
and trick superiors.

50
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,120
Come out!

51
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,440
You disrupt the government.

52
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,510
Get up!

53
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,990
You're a traitor to the country.

54
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,920
Traitor!

55
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,133
His Majesty has long abolished
the death penalty.

56
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,320
You slave.

57
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,560
How dare you use unlawful punishment

58
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,680
and conspire against a court official?

59
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,030
Having done something so wicked,

60
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,120
you'll get retribution sooner or later.

61
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,577
(Song Wuji, Mentee of Left Chancellor)

62
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,240
(East City)
Even if you kill me today,

63
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,950
you can't kill all the people

64
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,630
and stop them from talking.

65
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,550
Execute!

66
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,870
Go!

67
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,820
- Go!
- Don't touch me!

68
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,230
Left Chancellor.

69
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,510
Forgive me.

70
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,400
I hope you'll soon get rid
of those who are treacherous,

71
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,640
detox the court,

72
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,310
and restore clarity

73
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:04,222
to Tang Dynasty!

74
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,300
=Episode 5=

75
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,030
The Hu merchant we're meeting later

76
00:05:33,977 --> 00:05:35,800
are patrons to give you money.

77
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,040
You have to show

78
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,560
your authority as Chang'an's envoy.

79
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,560
Are they willing

80
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,377
to pay for the purchase of litchis?

81
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,830
(Litchi Bureau)

82
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,750
Don't worry.

83
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,080
The method

84
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,750
and amount

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,120
depend on how we

86
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,040
make it up and act.

87
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,510
Don't say too much.

88
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,400
Just cooperate with me.

89
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,390
Let me introduce you.

90
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,870
Envoy Li.

91
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,120
Shanglin Office's senior official.

92
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,311
His Majesty's most trusted confidant.

93
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,760
Envoy Li.

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Envoy Li.

95
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,120
Litchi Envoy

96
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,288
is a job granted by His Majesty.

97
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,080
In Chang'an,

98
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,320
all the top officials

99
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,560
vied for this job.

100
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,510
Only Envoy Li

101
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,600
was appointed.

102
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,220
Envoy Li deserves it.

103
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,500
Envoy Li went through so much hardship
to bring the imperial decree to Lingnan.

104
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,200
Being here to witness it

105
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,030
is an honor for you.

106
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,860
(Su Liang)
Yes.

107
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,790
Look.

108
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,880
Inspector's Office prepared everything

109
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,710
(Litchi Bureau)
to assist with the purchasing.

110
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,150
Envoy Li.

111
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,950
Litchi preserves
aren't considered rare, right?

112
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,950
Why did

113
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,120
His Majesty

114
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,000
send special envoys

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,590
to purchase them?

116
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,240
It's not litchi preserves.

117
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,120
Not all litchi preserves

118
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,533
can be offered
as tribute to His Majesty.

119
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,710
The 1st day of June
is Noble Consort's birthday.

120
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,710
The litchis for Noble Consort

121
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,510
must be of the highest

122
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,120
and premium quality.

123
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,844
It's Noble Consort's birthday.

124
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,800
His Majesty

125
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,200
will reward these litchi preserves

126
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,240
to the civil and military officials.

127
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,990
The civil and military officials
will give these litchi preserves

128
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,590
to their families.

129
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,680
How much will that be?

130
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,310
Yes.

131
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,955
This is just for this year.

132
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,390
With such purchases,

133
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,750
what ships out

134
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,080
might be litchis,

135
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,440
but what returns

136
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,320
will be money.

137
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,960
But...

138
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,190
But...

139
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,310
Not everyone

140
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,560
is qualified to transport the litchis.

141
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,240
Are you saying

142
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,880
whoever provides this tribute

143
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,030
will be decided by Envoy Li?

144
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,760
He's Litchi Envoy.

145
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,640
Envoy Li has unrestricted access

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,120
across Lingnan.

147
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,470
His goods don't need
to pass through customs.

148
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,155
Not to mention being taxed.

149
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,600
Everyone.

150
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,710
No need for me

151
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,350
to mention the benefits.

152
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,560
Sounds great.

153
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,820
Go home and prepare 1,000 guan.

154
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,750
Hurry.

155
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,040
Hurry.

156
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,400
Please wait.

157
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,590
Alright.

158
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,180
Do as you please.

159
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,800
Aren't we lying?

160
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,830
Lying?

161
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,680
That's how I was deceived.

162
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,600
I can take advantage

163
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,920
of my position
to make some money on the side,

164
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,200
but I can't

165
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,600
use the methods that my colleagues

166
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,950
used to harm me severely

167
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,630
to deceive the innocent.

168
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,870
They're not poor people.

169
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,470
They're businessmen.

170
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,960
This small sum of money

171
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,880
won't bankrupt them.

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,040
Let alone harm them severely.

173
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,310
I'll

174
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,040
do the deceiving.

175
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,960
You'll

176
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,880
take the money.

177
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,470
No.

178
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,040
Think about Xiu'er.

179
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,030
Here.

180
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,110
Alright.

181
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,520
The litchi preserves

182
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,590
will be up for open bidding
in three days.

183
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,560
Those with the admission qualification

184
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,440
can participate.

185
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,750
Think about it.

186
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,510
What else is there to think about?

187
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,750
Where can I get

188
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,320
this admission qualification?

189
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,430
I'll buy it.

190
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,630
Come here.

191
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,550
Here.

192
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,680
Everyone.

193
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,560
Me too.

194
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,044
Let me say something.

195
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,990
You might

196
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,430
only be paying

197
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,800
for an admission qualification.

198
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,110
It's just a qualification.

199
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,790
The business deal might not even

200
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,440
be yours.

201
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,044
Do you still want to spend this money?

202
00:10:17,044 --> 00:10:17,830
Envoy Li.

203
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,240
I'm

204
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,950
buying an opportunity.

205
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,870
I came to Tang Dynasty to do business.

206
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,630
I crossed mountains and seas
and encountered many hardships.

207
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,520
I keep worrying
that I'll die on my trip,

208
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,230
and that my wife and daughter
will not be able to survive.

209
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,390
If you can give me

210
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,520
this deal,

211
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,470
they can live well

212
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,350
even if I really die.

213
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,240
You're absolutely right.

214
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,000
We also...

215
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,080
Look, this is a good deed

216
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
for them.

217
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,150
They'll...

218
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,800
The whole family will have to thank you.

219
00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:47,590
- Yes.
- Yes.

220
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,590
Sorry, everyone.

221
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,760
I'm sorry.

222
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,560
My pal

223
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,955
misspoken something.

224
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,870
What His Majesty wants

225
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,160
is fresh litchis,

226
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,320
not litchi preserves.

227
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,480
I want to transport fresh litchis
back to Chang'an.

228
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,040
How can fresh litchis be transported?

229
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,750
Transporting fresh litchis

230
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,800
back to Chang'an?

231
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,390
This is impossible.

232
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,350
There's no way.

233
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,470
How is it possible?

234
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,750
You're deceiving us.

235
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,340
Give me back my money. Hurry.

236
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,080
You even said it's a good deal
that will happen every year.

237
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,040
Transporting the litchis

238
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:26,470
will put our lives on the line.

239
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,080
We're not buying
a qualification with money.

240
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,710
This is paying for trouble.

241
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,280
Yes.

242
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,990
Since everyone is unwilling,

243
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,960
I won't force it.

244
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,950
Let's end it here.

245
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,260
(Litchi Bureau)

246
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,190
Let's end it here.

247
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,720
He's leaving?

248
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,600
Is that all?

249
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,520
Pay us back.

250
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,800
Pay us back.

251
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,950
It's a misunderstanding.

252
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,280
Qilang, cool down.

253
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,840
Mind your tone

254
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,830
when you speak to Mr. Li.

255
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,950
Get lost!

256
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,550
You know what Mr. Li

257
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,710
is like.

258
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,360
Qilang.

259
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
Qilang.

260
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,470
Cool down.

261
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,360
Qilang.

262
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,470
Are you the only one who's upright?

263
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,990
Are you the only one who's a gentleman?

264
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,380
Is it easy for me
to find those Hu merchants?

265
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,230
It was so hard to set this up.

266
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,410
We were about to end it
after collecting the money.

267
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,620
Good job.

268
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,140
You ruined it yourself!

269
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,100
They're all fathers.

270
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,740
They gave me money

271
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,820
to make some money

272
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,911
and make life easier for their children.

273
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,880
I can't scam others

274
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,088
for my daughter.

275
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,340
They're rich,

276
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,460
and they can earn it back in the future.

277
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,460
Can you do that?

278
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,220
You only have three months to live.

279
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,620
You will die in three months.

280
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,700
Xiu'er will be sold into slavery.

281
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,740
Will she thank you

282
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,260
for being righteous?

283
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,300
An honorable man desires wealth

284
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,133
but obtains it justly.

285
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,300
With only three months left,

286
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,500
I don't believe

287
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,950
the only way I can do this is to lie.

288
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,980
Li Shande.

289
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,780
I've done my best for you.

290
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,420
You're on your own

291
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,460
to make money!

292
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,220
Qilang.

293
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,980
Don't persuade me!

294
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,540
Leave him to his death.

295
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,940
Calm down, Qilang.

296
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,688
There's no chance of winning.

297
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,180
I'm ready to risk everything

298
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,380
but have no weapons.

299
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,020
Sunken boat...

300
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,060
Even you are bullying me.

301
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,260
You're also bullying...

302
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,900
I'm dead!

303
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,820
Is this Envoy Li's residence?

304
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,380
Is the envoy at home?

305
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,980
Sorry to bother you.

306
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,940
I found out

307
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,380
where you were staying
at Qifeng Pavilion.

308
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,100
I hope I didn't

309
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,300
offend you.

310
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,460
A small gift.

311
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,820
Please take it.

312
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,500
Please

313
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,340
appreciate my sincerity.

314
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,220
You're so generous.

315
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,900
I'm here to recommend myself.

316
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,140
I'm a Hu

317
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,860
who runs a small business in Gaozhou.

318
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,140
I also have a Tang name

319
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,380
called

320
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,340
Su Liang.

321
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,980
Gusu's Gu.

322
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
It's Su from Gusu.

323
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,420
Liang that means forgiveness.

324
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,720
Liang that means consideration.

325
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,180
Liang that means understanding.

326
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,100
They affectionately call me

327
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,140
Su.

328
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,340
I understand

329
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,340
every word you Tang people speak,

330
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,300
but you

331
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,500
might not

332
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,740
fully understand what I said.

333
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,980
If what I said

334
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,620
confuses you,

335
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,180
that's only natural.

336
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,540
Don't

337
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,900
worry unnecessarily.

338
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,700
Well...

339
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,060
Well, the way you use idioms...

340
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,700
Well, what do you want?

341
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,620
Envoy Li.

342
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,220
You like to get straight to the point?

343
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,340
I like it too.

344
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,060
You must have run into

345
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,660
big trouble

346
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,660
that needs a lot of money.

347
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,020
Am I right?

348
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,660
Well...

349
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,340
So

350
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,300
I guessed it right?

351
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,300
Don't worry, Envoy Li.

352
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,540
I have money.

353
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,220
I

354
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,460
can lend it to you.

355
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,620
You can lend me money?

356
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,980
Of course.

357
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,060
We merchants

358
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,260
prefer

359
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,900
exchange.

360
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,740
Shrimp for fish.

361
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,860
Fish for shrimp.

362
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,700
Sea turtle for pangolin.

363
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,700
I don't have a pangolin.

364
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,460
I don't need a sea turtle either.

365
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,380
I want

366
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,580
to exchange something

367
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,900
with you.

368
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,620
I don't have

369
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,180
anything valuable.

370
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,020
Just now,

371
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,060
that fat,

372
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,180
handsome friend said

373
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,100
you travel freely in Lingnan

374
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,820
without any inspection

375
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,300
or tax.

376
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,220
I guess

377
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,500
you must have obtained

378
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,300
a travel pass.

379
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,740
I do have

380
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,955
a Five Prefectures Pass.

381
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,980
So I

382
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,140
guessed it right.

383
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,300
The goods aren't limited.

384
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,500
The pass is empty

385
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,700
and blank.

386
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,540
Right?

387
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,860
It's indeed blank.

388
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,700
Great.

389
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,666
Can you lend it to me first?

390
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,200
It will help me with my business.

391
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,133
How much money do you need?

392
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,940
Name a price.

393
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,300
I'll pay you now.

394
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,660
This way,

395
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,780
you'll get a sea turtle,

396
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,980
and I'll have a pangolin.

397
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,580
While we fight like clam and snip,

398
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,888
the fisherman benefits.

399
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,990
No, you didn't use this idiom
correctly either.

400
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,380
We Tang people...

401
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,420
You Tang people

402
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,180
value honesty above all.

403
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,460
I like that very much.

404
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,688
A promise made after three drinks

405
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,222
matters more than the five mountains.

406
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,860
Li Bai said that.

407
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,820
Why are you reciting poetry?

408
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,300
Well...

409
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,260
If we Tang people

410
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,660
impersonate others,

411
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,260
we'll be killed.

412
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,740
I understand.

413
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,260
Of course, I understand.

414
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,460
So

415
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,180
I won't let you suffer a loss.

416
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,820
I'll give you a big advantage.

417
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,820
Name a price.

418
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,820
I'll pay you right away.

419
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,260
766.

420
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,500
It's a deal.

421
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,180
It's a deal?

422
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,620
If you think it's too little, I can add

423
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,820
another 30%.

424
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,980
Let's make it a whole number.

425
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,140
1,000 guan.

426
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,220
What do you think?

427
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:54,860
No.

428
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,220
766 plus 30% of it

429
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,140
is 996.

430
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,340
996 then.

431
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,100
It's a deal.

432
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,180
Be careful.

433
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,780
Watch your step.

434
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,020
Slow down.

435
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,460
Walk slowly.

436
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,380
(20 Guan)

437
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,740
(33 Guan)

438
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,980
Shande, you're amazing.

439
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,244
He gave you extra,
yet you insisted on reducing the amount.

440
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,820
I just blurted it out.

441
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,980
I couldn't take it back.

442
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,660
I've never seen anyone

443
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,022
who treats a budget
like a final account like you.

444
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,700
But we underestimated

445
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,340
this pass's

446
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,700
potential value to merchants.

447
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,140
I bet he'll accept

448
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,100
even if you ask

449
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,380
for 1,500 guan.

450
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,860
Seeing how readily he agreed,

451
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,022
I'm a bit regretful too.

452
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,180
Anyway,

453
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,780
you gained a lot.

454
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,820
Are you leaving today?

455
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,420
Before coming here,

456
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,900
I went to Ministry of War's
Geography and Local Records Bureau

457
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,340
and copied a copy
of Map of Imperial Tang's Nine Provinces

458
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,100
and Comprehensive Records
of Post Stations.

459
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,500
I now have a clear understanding

460
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,900
of Tang Dynasty's transportation.

461
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,020
(Last night,)

462
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,020
(I spent the whole night
planning in the room.)

463
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,580
(After leaving Chang'an,)

464
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,860
enter Shangzhou's path from Lantian.

465
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,180
Cross Han River through Xiangzhou.

466
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,940
(Then, head south,)

467
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,820
(cross the river through Ezhou.)

468
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,420
Follow the river
to Hongzhou, Jizhou, Qianzhou.

469
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,700
Cross the Wuling through Mei Pass
to Shaozhou.

470
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,860
To reach Lingnan,

471
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:43,860
the total is

472
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,580
2723.5 km.

473
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,300
If 0.5 km consumes one guan,

474
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,180
that's

475
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,620
5,447 guan.

476
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,620
But I have no money

477
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,460
after coming to Lingnan.

478
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,220
I never tried it.

479
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,020
Try what?

480
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,333
Transport litchis?

481
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,020
If I manage to transport litchis,

482
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,660
I won't have to die.

483
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,540
Xiu'er will have her father.

484
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,860
You'd better die.

485
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,660
How can you
have the idea of ​​transporting litchis?

486
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,900
Now that you have money,
hurry back to Chang'an.

487
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,266
Save yourself from unnecessary delays
and complications.

488
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,060
Before leaving, Zimei said

489
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,020
I took a fatal mission,

490
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,940
but I might find a way to live

491
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,340
in a desperate situation.

492
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,660
I was swayed.

493
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,260
Shande, don't be swayed.

494
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,980
Zimei is a poet.

495
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,200
He doesn't bother with details.

496
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,700
He just said some stuff in Chang'an,

497
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,620
and you're swayed.

498
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,660
Find a way to live?

499
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,380
You're likely to fall into the abyss.

500
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,900
If Inspector's Office finds out
you sold the travel pass,

501
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,940
you're still doomed.

502
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,500
But I haven't even seen

503
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,620
a litch tree.

504
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,820
I can't accept it.

505
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,980
Why do you see that?

506
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,930
Just go back to Chang'an and see Xiu'er!

507
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,100
She's alone in Chang'an.

508
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,980
If my sister were alive,

509
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,140
she wouldn't
let you do whatever you want.

510
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,860
Gou'er.

511
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,180
Here.

512
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,580
Hire some ox carts

513
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,660
and laborers.

514
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,740
Pack Mr. Li's luggage.

515
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,140
Yes.

516
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,260
(Chang'an)

517
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:03,100
(Li's Barber Shop)

518
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,460
Did you

519
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,300
secretly forge this blade
using army steel?

520
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,620
You have a good eye.

521
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,500
My father

522
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,900
secretly forged it
using a broken Tang sword.

523
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,100
Because it's sharp,

524
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,460
it's my family heirloom.

525
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,900
I used it for many years.

526
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,300
Besides you,

527
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,940
only a guest
who came during Lantern Festival

528
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,220
of the 3rd year of Tianbao

529
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,140
recognized it.

530
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,780
Unfortunately,

531
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,260
my elder brother didn't recognize him.

532
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,980
Who would have thought

533
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,380
he was a hero

534
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,940
who dared to defy Heavens?

535
00:24:43,355 --> 00:24:45,380
The Lantern Festival
of the 3rd year of Tianbao?

536
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,580
Could it be...

537
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,140
Yes.

538
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,780
The water is cold.

539
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,220
Please wait.

540
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,244
I'll go and boil another basin of water.

541
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,460
Jijiang.

542
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,340
Uncle.

543
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,000
Get another basin of clean water.

544
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,300
Yes.

545
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,620
Left Chancellor.

546
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,020
After Wuji's house was confiscated,

547
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,940
the dismissed servants

548
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,100
have

549
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,660
all been located.

550
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,660
The servants who stayed in Chang'an
had no idea

551
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,990
about what Wuji was investigating.

552
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,420
Only his personal attendant

553
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,820
has likely

554
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,660
been imprisoned by Right Chancellor.

555
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,540
Right Chancellor.

556
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,460
I fulfilled my mission.

557
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,300
Song Wuji's attendant

558
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,740
spoke up.

559
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,740
Didn't he say he's loyal and unswerving?

560
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,220
Even the most loyal people

561
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,260
have weaknesses.

562
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,580
We have

563
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,940
his son.

564
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,380
Parental love is deep.

565
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,740
Wuji

566
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,060
wouldn't have rushed back

567
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,700
to see me,

568
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,780
if he hadn't found important news

569
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,820
in Lingnan.

570
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,220
It's a pity

571
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,100
Right Chancellor captured him

572
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,900
as soon as he entered Chang'an.

573
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:08,500
(East City)
(This news)

574
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,500
(wasn't delivered in time.)

575
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,620
He said Song Wuji
didn't find any evidence

576
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,620
on his trip to Lingnan.

577
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,590
He only said that he was checking
Qijing Pavilion at the end.

578
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,460
Qijing Pavilion

579
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,540
is the past that He Youguang

580
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,980
is most reluctant to mention.

581
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,540
Qijing Pavilion

582
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,733
was burned down.

583
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,020
Everything has changed since then.

584
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,820
I don't think he found

585
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,740
anything.

586
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,380
But that attendant confessed

587
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,580
Song Wuji

588
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,780
only hurried back to Chang'an

589
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,300
because there was hope.

590
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,980
Over the years,

591
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,700
I've been secretly

592
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,390
investigating the evidence
of Right Chancellor's corruption.

593
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,540
Wuji

594
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,380
vowed to bring down Right Chancellor.

595
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,220
He was not even afraid

596
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,420
of death.

597
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,740
Who knew

598
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,420
his words would come true?

599
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,380
Now,

600
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,420
Right Chancellor framed Wuji again.

601
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,860
He said

602
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,260
he used me

603
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,300
to extort local officials.

604
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,820
He also executed Wuji

605
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,340
without authorization.

606
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,380
How dare he say

607
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,140
it's to preserve my reputation?

608
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,700
I know

609
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,500
he's lying,

610
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,460
but I can't do anything.

611
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,740
We can only

612
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,740
endure

613
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,820
to avoid losing the big picture
for small matters.

614
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,140
You

615
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,900
should avoid suspicion all the more

616
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,820
to prevent Right Chancellor's followers
from making a fuss

617
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,060
about Wuji again

618
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,700
and causing a rift

619
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,088
between His Majesty and Left Chancellor.

620
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,100
He Youguang

621
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,100
asked me for the military tally

622
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,866
to mobilize the navy

623
00:28:03,911 --> 00:28:06,500
to recruit the surrounding pirates.

624
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,020
Over the years, he colluded

625
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,220
with Lingnan's officials.

626
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,180
He's quite capable

627
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,020
and has a huge influence there.

628
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,140
He wants to make it
his personal playground.

629
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,060
Afterward,

630
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,700
his money

631
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,780
is laundered through Hu merchants
before being brought into Chang'an.

632
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,020
That way,

633
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,180
it'll be watertight.

634
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,620
Since he's

635
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,140
loyal to me

636
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,220
all these years,

637
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,180
let's help him.

638
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,020
(Send someone reliable)

639
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,060
(to Lingnan)

640
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,580
(and deliver this message)

641
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,180
(to Ma Guiyun.)

642
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,020
(Tell him to stay there)

643
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,920
(and wait until the matter is resolved
before returning to Chang'an.)

644
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,500
The information

645
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,860
that Song Wuji found in Lingnan
must have been seized

646
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,860
by Right Chancellor.

647
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,740
(Security Bureau)

648
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,930
(Right Chancellor sent his men
out of the city overnight.)

649
00:29:01,933 --> 00:29:03,177
They're heading toward Gaozhou.

650
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,280
This way,

651
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,800
Lingnan is even more dangerous.

652
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,444
I wonder if Zheng Ping'an
can successfully break the deadlock.

653
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,760
You don't need to worry too much.

654
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,520
This person is quite clever.

655
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,920
He must be able to deal with it.

656
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,320
More importantly,

657
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,460
he wants to be accepted back
into the Zheng family.

658
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:27,755
People with obsessions
are the easiest to control.

659
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,520
(If his identity is exposed,)

660
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,920
(he's just an Assistant Minister
of Entertainment.)

661
00:29:34,155 --> 00:29:35,555
(We can just give him up.)

662
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,560
(Konglang won't let him leave Lingnan.)

663
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,080
Mr. Li, take care.

664
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,040
Gou'er.

665
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,520
Go and report to Inspector's Office

666
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,800
that Litchi Envoy is gone.

667
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,380
Have them arrange someone
to verify at the city gate.

668
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,840
Yes.

669
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,360
Mr. Li.

670
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,640
Guiyun.

671
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,360
It's a long way to Chang'an.

672
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,720
I don't know when we'll meet again.

673
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,120
Take care.

674
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,320
Green hills stretch across
the northern wall.

675
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,000
White water
flows around the eastern city.

676
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,920
We bid farewell here.

677
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,520
You'll travel far away.

678
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,700
The drifting clouds
reflect the traveler's feelings.

679
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,040
The sunset mirrors a friend's affection.

680
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,320
Wave goodbye.

681
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,840
The horses neigh mournfully.

682
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,360
I'm not very talented

683
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,240
and can't come up with a good poem.

684
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,280
I can only borrow
a few lines from Li Bai

685
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,120
to express my feelings.

686
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,920
Mr. Li.

687
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,280
The journey is dangerous.

688
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,680
Take care.

689
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,480
Since you gave me a poem,

690
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,320
I must give you one in return.

691
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,360
No need to be so polite.

692
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,800
No, we can't break the rules.

693
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,600
It's getting late.

694
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,520
I got one.

695
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,440
I got one.

696
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,240
I'm headed north
toward my hometown that's far away.

697
00:31:51,688 --> 00:31:55,200
My sleeves are wet with tears.

698
00:31:55,933 --> 00:31:58,760
I bid farewell from horseback
without paper or brush.

699
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,800
I'll write back
to assure you all is well.

700
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,480
This is a poem by Cen Shen.

701
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,760
I edited it.

702
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,880
The original poem is...

703
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,880
I understand.

704
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,160
Yours is better than Cen Shen's.

705
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,520
You mentioned yourself and safety.

706
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,960
Mr. Li.

707
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,400
Don't worry that no one knows you.

708
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,120
Everyone knows you.

709
00:32:19,822 --> 00:32:20,822
Time to go.

710
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,000
- Yes!
- Yes!

711
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:32,240
(Litchi Bureau)

712
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,080
Where are you going?

713
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,080
We're escorting a convoy to Chang'an.

714
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,240
This carriage driver
has a crooked mouth.

715
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,920
Well... I've been waiting
for a long time.

716
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,000
How long will it take?

717
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,120
It'll take a long time.

718
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,920
With so many people and so many carts,

719
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,600
at least four hours.

720
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,800
What's in this?

721
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,080
Who is this?

722
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,960
His name is Chen A-di.

723
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,000
Chen A-di.

724
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,320
(Since you have no way to retreat...)

725
00:33:37,244 --> 00:33:40,400
Why not take a step forward
and fight with all your might?

726
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,360
Perhaps you can find
some glimmer of hope.

727
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,040
Did the girl who sells litchis not come?

728
00:33:58,555 --> 00:34:00,280
Do you mean that Dong girl?

729
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,150
Yes.

730
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,140
I haven't seen her today.

731
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,590
Sir.

732
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,390
How about you give me 20 coins?

733
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,950
I'll take you to her immediately.

734
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:11,750
Sir.

735
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,030
Let's discuss it.

736
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,870
Look at my stall.

737
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,790
I'm doing business.

738
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,866
Do your business then.

739
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:17,150
What does it have to do with me?

740
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,070
Well...

741
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,270
Let's discuss it.

742
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,550
Let's bargain.

743
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,190
Ten coins.

744
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,230
This is her litch orchard.

745
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:35,830
Sir.

746
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,510
This is where the Dong people

747
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,870
plant the litch trees.

748
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,030
But

749
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,070
it has just bloomed,

750
00:34:41,155 --> 00:34:42,430
and the fruit hasn't matured.

751
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,710
Take a look.

752
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,190
This doesn't look pleasant.

753
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,390
Even Zimei

754
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,790
can't write much about this.

755
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,150
Sir.

756
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,190
The litch trees

757
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,310
might not look great.

758
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,310
These are litchis
grown by Gaozhou's Dong people.

759
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,630
They're the best.

760
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,230
Especially the Dong girl
you're looking for.

761
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,430
Her name is Tong.

762
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,830
The litchis she grows

763
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,350
are big and round.

764
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,511
The flesh is thick and juicy.

765
00:35:06,555 --> 00:35:08,377
It has the best reputation near and far.

766
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,750
I'll have to check it out.

767
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,950
The litch orchard ahead

768
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,270
is...

769
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:14,790
hers.

770
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,550
Sir.

771
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:19,022
Payment.

772
00:35:19,622 --> 00:35:21,355
I can't come here for nothing, can I?

773
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,430
Here.

774
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,470
Find ten coins.

775
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,790
Sure, don't worry.

776
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,710
Look.

777
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,310
Let's forget about the rest.

778
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,070
Forget it?

779
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:32,790
Well...

780
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:33,830
Forget it.

781
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,430
You...

782
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,430
A city folk

783
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,590
wearing official robes!

784
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,550
- Where?
- Where?

785
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,840
There's indeed a city folk
wearing official robes.

786
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,910
But he doesn't seem like the one who
came to confiscate our orchard.

787
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,190
We chased that one away.

788
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,610
This one is probably newly assigned
by Inspector's Office.

789
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,110
Litchi Bureau.

790
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,040
Did Inspector's Office
inform you in advance?

791
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,550
They came here a few days ago.

792
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,430
Inspector He is quite attentive.

793
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,511
I'm Litchi Envoy.

794
00:36:30,911 --> 00:36:32,377
You're willing to die for litchis, huh?

795
00:36:32,444 --> 00:36:33,950
It's willing to die for money!

796
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:34,870
Attack!

797
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:40,510
Ban.

798
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,070
No, what do you...

799
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,390
Thank you.

800
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,230
You...

801
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,070
What do you want?

802
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,430
No.

803
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,590
You must be after something.

804
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,990
Are you after money

805
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,230
or...

806
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,910
What do you want?

807
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,030
Speak up.

808
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,510
I say

809
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,870
we give him a good beating first.

810
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,150
I can't help it anymore.

811
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,630
What are you doing?

812
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:09,870
Are they infested with worms?

813
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,110
Catch that worm

814
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,030
and show me.

815
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:14,190
It rained a few days ago.

816
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,310
Could it be stink bugs?

817
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,550
No.

818
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,950
It's Lady Stoneback.

819
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,670
Isn't this a stink bug?

820
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,190
No.

821
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,110
We set up bamboo ropes between the trees

822
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,250
for the giant ants to travel.

823
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,470
They'll kill Lady Stoneback.

824
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:31,750
Your method

825
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,670
won't work.

826
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,550
Stink bugs can fly.

827
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,310
Ants can't catch them.

828
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,110
Untie me.

829
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,130
I have a solution. Hurry.

830
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:45,790
Stink bugs

831
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:46,950
are filled with stinky juice.

832
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,710
It smells awful and won't come off.

833
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,830
It won't come off with water.

834
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:50,830
There's mint.

835
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,230
Wipe it with mint leaves.

836
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,190
Do you know mint leaves?

837
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:06,590
It doesn't stink anymore.

838
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:07,950
It doesn't stink anymore?

839
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,200
- It doesn't stink anymore?
- It doesn't stink anymore?

840
00:38:10,222 --> 00:38:11,510
Let us smell it.

841
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,110
It really doesn't stink anymore.

842
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:13,950
Smell it.

843
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,240
It really doesn't stink anymore.

844
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,350
It works, right?

845
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,590
Let me tell you.

846
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,110
Stink bugs

847
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,040
not only suck the juice from leaves,

848
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,750
they also suck
the juice from the stamens.

849
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,710
When your fruits

850
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,670
grow,

851
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,190
they'll even suck their juice.

852
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,430
Do you still want

853
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,510
good litchis?

854
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:30,990
Hurry up and untie me.

855
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,310
I'll help you deal with the bugs.

856
00:38:36,533 --> 00:38:37,870
(Litchi Bureau)
Here, let's peel together.

857
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:38,790
Hurry.

858
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,590
Does anyone
have a black locust for washing clothes?

859
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:55,830
I have black locusts at home.

860
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,070
Go get it.

861
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:57,910
Get some water

862
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,630
and make black locust juice.

863
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,590
Half of you

864
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,470
can pick the mint leaves.

865
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,230
Squeeze them into juice too.

866
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,430
Water is here.

867
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:07,310
Here, make way.

868
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,390
The black locust is here.

869
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,070
Here.

870
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:09,990
Here, make way.

871
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:10,790
Here, make way.

872
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:11,150
Here.

873
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,170
- Will it work?
- Here.

874
00:39:15,911 --> 00:39:16,910
Black locusts are here.

875
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:17,830
Mint leaves are here.

876
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,430
No, don't eat it.

877
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:25,070
Well, pour the mint leaves
into the black locust juice

878
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:25,990
and stir well.

879
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:35,790
Stir it until it foams.

880
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:36,790
Alright.

881
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:37,830
Foam...

882
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:38,830
Stir it vigorously.

883
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,110
Alright.

884
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,190
- Work hard.
- Stir it.

885
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,230
Alright.

886
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,950
Come with me.

887
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:51,910
(Litchi Bureau)

888
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:02,910
What are you doing?

889
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,750
Chief is back!

890
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,310
You...

891
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,510
Ms. Tong.

892
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:11,710
Why are you here?

893
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,630
I...

894
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:16,950
Lady Stoneback is dead.

895
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:20,550
It's really dead.

896
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,470
It's dead.

897
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,630
That city folk

898
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,390
said he had a way
to kill Lady Stoneback.

899
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,230
All the ones on the tree died.

900
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,270
He's good!

901
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:30,790
- Good.
- Good.

902
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,830
I didn't come up with it.

903
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,950
This is our ancestors' wisdom.

904
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,230
This is how I get rid of bugs

905
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,430
in the gardens of Chang'an.

906
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:41,030
Don't splash it randomly.

907
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:41,870
It's for bugs,

908
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:42,630
not for people.

909
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,550
Don't waste it.

910
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:44,510
Stop splashing it.

911
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,490
You know what to do now.

912
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:45,990
Hurry up.

913
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:46,950
Splash the bugs.

914
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:47,870
Get to work!

915
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,990
Alright.

916
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,750
- Work.
- Don't waste it.

917
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,310
Don't waste it!

918
00:41:55,466 --> 00:41:56,777
Why are you here today?

919
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,310
I went to Qifeng Pavilion

920
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:00,910
to buy litchis from you.

921
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:01,830
You're not there.

922
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,830
The merchant said
the litchis here are good,

923
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,030
so I came here.

924
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,350
I didn't expect

925
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,555
you to have a bug plague.

926
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,390
You're so young.

927
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:10,470
All this

928
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,430
is yours?

929
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,230
My parents left it to me.

930
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,270
But we only

931
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,630
have March Reds right now.

932
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,050
Wait until April,

933
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,370
I'll pick the best ones
and send them to the city for you.

934
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,770
I can't wait until April.

935
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,470
I'm going back to Chang'an.

936
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,030
I just want to buy some litchis from you

937
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:27,950
and take them with me

938
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,310
to see how long they can last.

939
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,630
