1
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,999
=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,900
(A Lone Path Up Mount Hua)

3
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,900
(Fifteen Years Ago)

4
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,120
Liangyuan?

5
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,400
Liangyuan!

6
00:02:25,555 --> 00:02:26,822
Guess who I just ran into.

7
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,470
Who?

8
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,310
The new student of
the Crown Prince's Bureau, Mr. Cui.

9
00:02:33,177 --> 00:02:34,000
Why the blank stare?

10
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,470
Come with me.

11
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,710
Go where?

12
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,240
To meet Mr. Cui.

13
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,190
You know, Mr. Cui Shiyi.

14
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,680
He's new to the Imperial College.
You haven't met him yet.

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,244
From the Cui clan of Qinghe.

16
00:02:43,244 --> 00:02:45,800
His father is the Vice Minister
at the Crown Prince's Bureau.

17
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,030
Young lords of the Wang family

18
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,080
of Taiyuan will be there.

19
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:48,977
Come on.

20
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,470
I'm just a commoner.

21
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,120
I'd better not.

22
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,680
You go.

23
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,310
Liangyuan.

24
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,960
If you insist,

25
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,590
I'll go then.

26
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,960
This mountain is really tall.

27
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,520
Jinniang?

28
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,488
Young Lady Zheng.

29
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,120
Jinniang?

30
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,870
She's from the Zheng clan of Xingyang,

31
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,800
once betrothed to the Shiyi.

32
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,310
What happened?

33
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,030
It's nothing.

34
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,400
I sprained my ankle.

35
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
It's been half a year.

36
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,750
Is your family well?

37
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,120
Thanks to you,

38
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,030
all is well.

39
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,280
She is a noblewoman.

40
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,000
The matchmakers

41
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,590
kept knocking on her door.

42
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,190
Even sons of high officials

43
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,240
could hardly win her hand.

44
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:08,088
Why was the engagement broken?

45
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,240
Half a year ago,

46
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,840
Jinniang's father's branch

47
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,710
was expelled from the Zheng clan.

48
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,280
So...

49
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:19,977
You still keep this token...

50
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,240
Ranks must stay apart.

51
00:04:22,288 --> 00:04:23,360
Nobles can't wed commoners.

52
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,680
Mr. Cui's decision

53
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,950
is quite reasonable.

54
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,070
Let me help you.

55
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,630
I could fall for you.

56
00:04:37,088 --> 00:04:38,160
So, you know everything.

57
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,070
Parents gave the order

58
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,888
and matchmakers arranged.

59
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,600
Please leave, Mr. Cui.

60
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,480
We wouldn't want gossip.

61
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,160
How about

62
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,040
we carry her down in turns?

63
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,870
No.

64
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,630
I mean,

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,511
if we risk our lives to carry her down

66
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,720
and someone sees it,

67
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,222
they will talk.

68
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,600
True.

69
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,360
Besides,

70
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,510
carrying a girl

71
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,120
expelled by the Zheng clan

72
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,510
would disgrace our own families.

73
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,240
Not to mention

74
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,420
if she clings to us,

75
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,240
we may never shake her off.

76
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,430
Please go, Mr. Cui.

77
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,560
Do not keep me

78
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,600
from enjoying the view.

79
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,070
Let's go.

80
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,560
Please.

81
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,560
This way.

82
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,577
It's swollen.

83
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,000
It's sprained.

84
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,040
I'll help you up.

85
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,600
Give me the sachet.

86
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,270
No, that's not what I meant.

87
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,190
Lecher!

88
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,933
How could you ask for a girl's sachet?

89
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:50,377
I...

90
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:51,390
I don't want it.

91
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,190
I just want a sniff.

92
00:06:57,222 --> 00:06:58,133
Here, take it.

93
00:06:58,244 --> 00:06:59,390
It isn't worth much anyway.

94
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:07,870
Borneol.

95
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,190
Musk.

96
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,920
Smells good.

97
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,160
Here.

98
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,466
Here it comes.

99
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,600
Lecher!

100
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,400
Save the tantrum
for after we're off the mountain.

101
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,510
You are too injured to move.

102
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,190
I'll carry you.

103
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,680
We only just met.

104
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,111
Why take the risk?

105
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,310
It's no risk.

106
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,688
It's getting dark.

107
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,200
We're both stuck here.

108
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:00,830
That way.

109
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,000
Where?

110
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:02,480
That way.

111
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,390
Put me down.

112
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,270
This is too dangerous.

113
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,000
We can't see the road ahead.

114
00:08:17,822 --> 00:08:19,511
That doesn't mean there's no road.

115
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,190
We will follow the path under our feet.

116
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,560
Step by step.

117
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,390
Step by step.

118
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,040
Step by step.

119
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,111
We'll get out eventually.

120
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,870
I promised to carry you.

121
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,910
I won't leave you halfway.

122
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,320
Sir.

123
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:43,720
What is your surname?
How should I address you?

124
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,720
If we had fallen and died just now,

125
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:47,270
I would not even know who I had

126
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:47,840
died with.

127
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,600
My surname is Li,

128
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,190
and my courtesy name is Liangyuan.

129
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,644
I'm from Huayin County.

130
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,480
What a relief. I thought

131
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,990
you were from the Five Great Families.

132
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,790
I am not.

133
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,120
How old are you?

134
00:08:59,510 --> 00:08:59,960
I...

135
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,630
I am twenty.

136
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,440
Twenty?

137
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,440
You look much older.

138
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,960
Yes.

139
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,466
I look like this now,

140
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,320
and at forty

141
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,910
I will look the same.

142
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,270
What is your name?

143
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,960
I will tell you once we are down.

144
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,266
I can't go on. I need a rest.

145
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,630
Don't fall.

146
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,870
Liangyuan,

147
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,240
when you passed by the spindle tree,

148
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,777
were you afraid?

149
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,360
Yes.

150
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,360
Why?

151
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,960
Two lives were at stake.

152
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,440
But I still had to carry you down.

153
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,750
At night...

154
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,600
At night,

155
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,030
if the bugs did not bite you to death,

156
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,630
the cold would.

157
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,270
Right?

158
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,720
Come.

159
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,955
Hold tight. Let's go.

160
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,480
What's so funny?

161
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,630
Nothing.

162
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,120
Still laughing?

163
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,910
I just remembered something.

164
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,200
When I was little,

165
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,644
I went to Chang'an to sell sheep.

166
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,800
Just two of them.

167
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,120
One of the sheep was

168
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,066
dumb as a post.

169
00:10:14,711 --> 00:10:15,550
It fell into a ditch.

170
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:16,977
It twisted its leg.

171
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,240
So then I

172
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,510
carried one sheep

173
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,270
and led the other to Chang'an.

174
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,150
Why do I feel

175
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,510
like you're making fun of me?

176
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,150
I am.

177
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,150
So what's your name?

178
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,960
I'll tell you once we're down.

179
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,600
We're almost there.

180
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,080
Tell me.

181
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,400
We're not there yet.

182
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,750
We're basically there.

183
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,020
=Episode 17=

184
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,390
Solid.

185
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,030
Solid.

186
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,120
Solid.

187
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,030
Ms. Amita.

188
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,840
The litchi transport project
is approved.

189
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,440
- Good.
- Great!

190
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,960
Let's not celebrate just yet.

191
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,200
Let me be blunt.

192
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,440
The Hu Merchants' Association

193
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,480
has a rule.

194
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,630
If the project shows no progress

195
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,960
within 30 days,

196
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,080
the funds will be withdrawn.

197
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,630
So you'd better make up

198
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,600
for the lost two days.

199
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,750
Of course.

200
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,120
I'll get right to it.

201
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,440
You have my thanks.

202
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,480
Hurry up, Li.

203
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,240
Get up!

204
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,300
(Inspector's Office)

205
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,510
Today, Li Shande's place

206
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,480
was swarming with merchants.

207
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,200
I sent someone over

208
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,259
to give him Eight Linglong cups,

209
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,288
five glazed goblets,
and two gold-inlaid teapots.

210
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,750
Such fine gifts

211
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,360
were all wasted.

212
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,030
He is the Litchi Envoy

213
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,120
on an imperial assignment.

214
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,910
We ought to

215
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,510
show some respect too.

216
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,670
Don't worry.

217
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,200
If he falls one day,

218
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,320
I'll take it all back.

219
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,630
This Inspector's Office

220
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,910
isn't short on gifts.

221
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,750
Indeed.

222
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,460
(Lingnan, Fang's Coconuts)

223
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,840
It was my mistake.

224
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,720
What on earth were you thinking?

225
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,960
I embarrassed the Inspector's Office.

226
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,550
Such a great opportunity,

227
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,150
and Li Shande

228
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,750
stole the attention!

229
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,080
What is the Inspector's Office for?

230
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,000
Are we just here to applaud?

231
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,510
The big fish swam away,

232
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,240
and now you think of casting a net?

233
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,910
What good does that do?

234
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,440
It's too late!

235
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,390
Yes, Sir.

236
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,440
Godfather.

237
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,120
Amita.

238
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,240
Why are you still standing here?

239
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,000
Get going.

240
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,630
Yes.

241
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,390
Be useful for once!

242
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,150
Yes...

243
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,390
Amita.

244
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,320
Here you are.

245
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,030
It was my oversight.

246
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,240
I didn't expect Li Shande

247
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,480
to come up with such a plan.

248
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,250
How long have you been

249
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,600
by my side?

250
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,480
Ten years now.

251
00:14:35,088 --> 00:14:37,320
I remember when you first came back,
you were only

252
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,600
this tall.

253
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,390
Back then, your father died.

254
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,550
I did everything I could

255
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,510
to help our brothers

256
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,080
live a stable life.

257
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,120
I did right by your father.

258
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,670
I raised you with great effort,

259
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,440
and I helped you

260
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,270
become the leader of the Association.

261
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,600
And me?

262
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,390
Aside from pretending to be mad,

263
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,111
fighting birds and playing the fool,

264
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,670
I've done nothing else.

265
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,080
And why did I do all that?

266
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,080
Because I hoped

267
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,790
we could work well together

268
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,270
and quietly maintain

269
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,670
the good life we've built.

270
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,750
Now that we have the military tally,

271
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,000
Right Chancellor is waiting eagerly

272
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,750
for us

273
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,630
to control trade on the route.

274
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,870
But what have we done?

275
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,840
We've made no progress.

276
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,200
Then, Li Shande stirred things up.

277
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,480
All the Hu merchants

278
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,150
flocked over to his side.

279
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,750
If this keeps up,

280
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,870
our good days

281
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,480
will soon come to an end.

282
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,870
You are right, Godfather.

283
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,720
I understand.

284
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,910
I made a deal with Li Shande.

285
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,960
If he fails to produce

286
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,755
a viable transport plan for the litchis,

287
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,200
we withdraw the funds.

288
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,030
And if he delivers one?

289
00:16:05,288 --> 00:16:06,270
Don't worry, Godfather.

290
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,270
Fresh litchis only last eleven days.

291
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,200
Transport alone takes thirteen.

292
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,977
Unless he sprouts wings and flies,

293
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,120
it's simply impossible.

294
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,790
Absolutely impossible?

295
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,630
Completely impossible?

296
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,960
Every time we say

297
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,120
it's impossible,

298
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,030
he somehow

299
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,200
pulls something off.

300
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,080
Ever since he came to Lingnan,

301
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,750
he has been constantly

302
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,750
thwarting our plans!

303
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,510
I'll keep an eye on Li Shande.

304
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,360
I won't let Su Liang take the seat.

305
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,320
Amita.

306
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,510
I'm tired of hearing that line.

307
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,150
What I want is a solution.

308
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,080
What I need is a result.

309
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,550
Amita.

310
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:06,222
Don't fault Inspector He for being mad.

311
00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:09,466
You're the leader
of the Hu Merchants' Association.

312
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,110
You represent his reputation.

313
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,550
Now that you've been made a fool of...

314
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,920
Shut up.

315
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,790
I just want to ask

316
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,590
what the plan is.

317
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,400
I'll figure that out myself.

318
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,688
You need not worry.

319
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,110
Inspector He still trusts you.

320
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,680
If you fail,

321
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,440
you get scolded.

322
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,960
But if I fail,

323
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,880
it won't end with a scolding.

324
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,880
Your punishment

325
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,400
has nothing to do with me.

326
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,110
If Li Shande isn't removed,

327
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,111
the next Association leader will be Su.

328
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,830
And whether I lead or not,

329
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,240
that's none of your concern either.

330
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,350
Inspector He scolded me first, then you.

331
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,240
Do you think that means

332
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,590
we each solve our own problems?

333
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,480
Your business and mine

334
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,680
all serve Inspector He.

335
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:53,110
I got all set up.

336
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,790
Ms. Amita.

337
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,270
Alright, carry on.

338
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,590
Mr. Li.

339
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,830
Let me introduce you.

340
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:22,400
This is Mr. Wei,

341
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,790
Mr. Zhao and Mr. Zhou.

342
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,550
All three of them

343
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,160
are top clients of the Association.

344
00:18:27,311 --> 00:18:29,720
They heard about your plan
to deliver litchis to Chang'an.

345
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,000
They are very intrigued.

346
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,600
- Mr. Li.
- Mr. Li.

347
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,440
Gentlemen.

348
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,400
Mr. Li.

349
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,590
It's an honor.

350
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,640
Mr. Li.

351
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,160
We came here

352
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,440
at Ms. Amita's request,

353
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,480
hoping to see the project firsthand.

354
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,790
We're looking forward

355
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,720
to working with you.

356
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,200
We'd appreciate it
if you could walk us through

357
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,590
the plan.

358
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,400
Well, I already explained everything

359
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,510
at the Association the other day.

360
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,590
I'm not much of a speaker.

361
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,960
I'd hate to disrespect anyone.

362
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,350
In business,

363
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,960
customers always come first.

364
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,000
If our clients have requests,

365
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,088
we must do our best to meet them.

366
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,030
This venture

367
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,400
is fully funded by the Association.

368
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,640
Mr. Li, you should cooperate.

369
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,880
Su and Lan Yu are already

370
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,960
supervising the litchi garden.

371
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,933
What more do you expect from me?

372
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,680
Mr. Li,

373
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,050
we're here

374
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,680
to help you carry out

375
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,790
this groundbreaking project.

376
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,510
That's all.

377
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,590
By the way, see this outfit?

378
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,880
It's a Hu-style robe,

379
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,750
redesigned by none other than

380
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,110
Dafu Company.

381
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,510
Bright colors,

382
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,422
with a touch of Tang flair.

383
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,170
If you could help spread the word

384
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,880
and recommend it to others,

385
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,920
our sales will be...

386
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,510
Wait, I just transport litchis.

387
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,830
Why am I the one doing promotions

388
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,160
for your clothing?

389
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,680
I don't want the attention.

390
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,830
I don't need that.

391
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,510
Ms. Amita, it seems Mr. Li

392
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,030
may have misunderstood

393
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,310
our partnership a little.

394
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,400
Could you help explain it to him?

395
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,830
These three patrons' orders

396
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,960
make up nearly a third

397
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
of our Association.

398
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,310
If Mr. Li refuses to cooperate,

399
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,200
any future funding issues

400
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,000
will be out of my hands.

401
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,750
Gentlemen,

402
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,880
what you saw earlier

403
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,750
was the growing zone.

404
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,640
Now,

405
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,160
we're looking at the village...

406
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,310
Come to the center.

407
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,266
The villages of Dong people
who are experts in growing litchis.

408
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,720
Is this a litchi tree too?

409
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,920
You have a sharp eye.

410
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,830
This one here

411
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,160
is the thousand-year-old tree.

412
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,960
It has a remarkable history.

413
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,240
The entire garden

414
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,550
thrives under its protection.

415
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,550
You really do have a keen eye.

416
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,400
Look at them.

417
00:20:50,488 --> 00:20:51,960
These mountain folk are so delighted

418
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,480
after tasting litchis.

419
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,200
Now imagine

420
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,000
how honored you'd be if Noble Consort

421
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,200
got to enjoy these herself.

422
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,880
Gentlemen, do you know

423
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,160
what these double-layer jars
are used for?

424
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,510
Well...

425
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,070
You're absolutely right.

426
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,310
They're for transporting spices.

427
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,350
The Hu Merchants' Association

428
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,880
paid a hefty price for these.

429
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,880
It was all thanks to Mr. Li...

430
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,640
Li...

431
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,510
Mr. Li!

432
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,070
Right.

433
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,510
Mr. Li!

434
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,480
It's all thanks to Mr. Li

435
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,350
for this water-seal preservation method.

436
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,790
Mr. Li, you've really worked hard.

437
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,480
Not at all.

438
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,160
Mr. Li is a true professional.

439
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,030
Tong?

440
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,880
Come on.

441
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,920
Tong, get up.

442
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,350
This young lady is Miss Tong.

443
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,590
She may be young,

444
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,790
but she is the head
of the entire litchi garden.

445
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,240
She's in charge of everything.

446
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,480
This girl

447
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,790
is a bit headstrong,

448
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,550
but she really

449
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,070
loves this job.

450
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,720
Just look at

451
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,244
how well she manages everything.

452
00:21:48,288 --> 00:21:49,644
Come on, greet the bosses.

453
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,030
Wonderful.

454
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,460
- Come.
- She's got quite the attitude!

455
00:21:54,466 --> 00:21:55,955
Let's keep going.

456
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,160
Mr. Li,

457
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,288
what's the story
with those bamboo baskets over there?

458
00:22:00,933 --> 00:22:02,680
Those are freshly delivered backups,

459
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,680
meant specifically for carrying litchis.

460
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,790
That seems like a bit of a waste.

461
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,240
They look like the ones we use

462
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,880
at the docks for shipping goods.

463
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,220
There are no brandings

464
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,960
or custom designs on them.

465
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,830
They just won't do.

466
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,640
Mr. Li,

467
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,622
you pick a style.

468
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,240
Rest assured,

469
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,310
we'll provide all the baskets for free.

470
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,510
Exactly.

471
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,540
(Dafu Fruit Store)

472
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,510
The most important thing is,

473
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,720
Mr. Zhao's store name

474
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,200
must be clearly visible.

475
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,750
So, the jars for storing the litchis,

476
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,590
the horses,

477
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,720
the riders' uniforms,

478
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,000
and the litchi packaging...

479
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,590
All of these have to be in your design?

480
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,880
Mr. Li,

481
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,830
we'll take care of it.

482
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,550
And the cost is on us.

483
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,070
It's not about the cost.

484
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,030
It's about efficiency.

485
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,790
These litchis aren't sweet enough.

486
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,030
We can cure them

487
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,880
with sugar.

488
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,510
And still call them fresh litchis?

489
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,720
Can we change the name?

490
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,310
Let's just call them "Fortune Fruit."

491
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,790
It's a lucky name.

492
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,270
That'll definitely boost sales.

493
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,000
Get some trending poets

494
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,640
to write

495
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,000
verses about "Fortune Fruit."

496
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,390
They're sure to become famous.

497
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,240
How about this?

498
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,750
What if we paint all the jars

499
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,790
red?

500
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,720
That too has

501
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,000
a great symbolic meaning.

502
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,790
Festive. Very festive.

503
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,270
And the horses.

504
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,920
What about the horses? What horses?

505
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,350
Is there no end to this?

506
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,688
If you keep messing with things,

507
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,044
am I transporting litchis,

508
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,510
or is this turning into a joke?

509
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,440
Do you want to

510
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,200
see me make a fool of myself?

511
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:32,955
- No, that's not what we meant.
- No.

512
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,880
Mr. Li,

513
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,830
you've misunderstood.

514
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,590
We're just making suggestions,

515
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,350
and suggestions can be discussed,

516
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:39,830
right?

517
00:23:40,111 --> 00:23:41,720
When it comes to transporting litchis,

518
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,270
we're all laymen here.

519
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,240
In the end, it's up to you to decide.

520
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,790
If we want to make it widely known,

521
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,440
and if we want this business

522
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,200
to really grab
everyday folks' attention,

523
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,550
we're the experts in that.

524
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,270
Exactly.

525
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,110
Of course.

526
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,640
Mr. Li, you're from the Shanglin Office.

527
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,110
You're a trained professional.

528
00:23:58,466 --> 00:23:59,350
You probably look down

529
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,550
on our cheap tricks.

530
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,960
We get it. We understand.

531
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,750
But without these tricks,

532
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,440
we wouldn't be making any money, right?

533
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,440
Exactly.

534
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,750
Mr. Wei...

535
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,400
I'm not good with words,

536
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,550
but I meant no offense.

537
00:24:23,155 --> 00:24:24,644
I know that you all are major clients

538
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,830
of the Hu Merchants' Association.

539
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,640
I'm just

540
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,550
someone doing a job.

541
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,920
As for what you brought up today,

542
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,400
this partnership,

543
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,920
I'm afraid I can't go along with it.

544
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,880
Mr. Li has integrity and dedication.

545
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,070
You truly do the work.

546
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,400
I admire that.

547
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,070
You're too kind.

548
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,160
Mr. Li,

549
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,110
isn't your daughter attending school

550
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,640
at an embroidery workshop

551
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,070
on Willow Lane in Anren Ward?

552
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,310
That workshop is run

553
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,880
by an old eunuch named Wang.

554
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,480
You know him?

555
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,510
Yes, that's right.

556
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,070
Funny how that works out.

557
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,550
The place he's renting

558
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,400
belongs to me.

559
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,270
Back when he first opened,

560
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,440
he was struggling financially,

561
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,550
and I gave him some help.

562
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,200
Now, if I were to
take back that storefront

563
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,750
and reclaim the land,

564
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,400
wouldn't that old eunuch

565
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,350
end up out on the street?

566
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,200
Mr. Li,

567
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,160
out of courtesy and reason,

568
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,750
please consider

569
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,030
becoming our

570
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,240
business partners.

571
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,590
Go back and tell Zhao Xinmin,

572
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,133
that I won't play his game.

573
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,030
Ms. Amita!

574
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,666
That slap is going to cost you.

575
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,240
Li Shande,

576
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,110
are you still going to eat?

577
00:25:55,577 --> 00:25:58,022
Let's eat somewhere else.
The smell is off-putting.

578
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,880
Coming!

579
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:09,590
Move faster!

580
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,480
Move them inside.

581
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,270
Remember them.

582
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,590
Come on.

583
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,510
Since these match

584
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,720
their technical specs,

585
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,310
once you've

586
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,550
painted them properly,

587
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,000
we'll come back to inspect them.

588
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,960
Move them inside!

589
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,030
Don't break them!

590
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,310
Get that fool out of here.

591
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,030
He's in the way.

592
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,510
Out of here!

593
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:39,830
Leave here!

594
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,030
That's my brother.

595
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,640
Stop yapping!

596
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,590
You just can't stop, can you?

597
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,750
You messed up

598
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,830
everything we sorted out!

599
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,790
Miss Tong,

600
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,350
these are key points

601
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,640
the bosses mentioned.

602
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,000
I was only sorting

603
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,240
and checking inventory.

604
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:03,270
Keep your dog on a leash.

605
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,750
This is my turf.

606
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,070
You're not the one in charge here.

607
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,000
Li Shande

608
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,480
is in charge of the litchi transport.

609
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,160
Anything you want to move,

610
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,350
you have to ask him first.

611
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,480
I'm from the Association,

612
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,022
and was sent here to oversee all of you.

613
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,200
Besides, everything here

614
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,680
was paid for

615
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,830
by our Association.

616
00:27:16,955 --> 00:27:18,590
But the Litchi Envoy
hasn't approved yet!

617
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,000
But Ms. Amita already has.

618
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,720
If she approves it,

619
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,222
then I'll make it happen. Got that?

620
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,510
Fine.

621
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,270
I'll go tell Li Shande.

622
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,550
Be my guest.

623
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,830
And while you're at it, ask Li Shande

624
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,240
how long it'll take to repaint

625
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,000
and refit these.

626
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,550
Time's ticking.

627
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:37,830
I'll be back to inspect.

628
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,480
Fine, I'll go.

629
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,640
Your wine.

630
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,977
Buy Inspector He some sugarcane.

631
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:56,830
Ms. Amita.

632
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:58,960
Ms. Amita!

633
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,270
It's been a while.

634
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,680
Try the tripe I saved for you.

635
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,510
Great.

636
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,110
The usual?

637
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,550
Two cups of wine.

638
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,400
Sure.

639
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:11,400
The food will take a while.

640
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,790
Have some litchis first.

641
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,070
Zhao Xinmin sent

642
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,310
Wei Yizhou for the deal.

643
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,680
You hit him.

644
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,440
How do we explain that to him?

645
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:23,960
Your wine.

646
00:28:26,511 --> 00:28:27,310
Zhao Xinmin is just

647
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,590
He Youguang's lapdog.

648
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,088
No need to worry about me.

649
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,440
Worry about yourself.

650
00:28:32,733 --> 00:28:33,750
Even though I don't know

651
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,680
why you helped me,

652
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,160
thank you anyway.

653
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,270
Me hitting him
has nothing to do with you.

654
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,880
I have my own reasons.

655
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,030
Tell me,

656
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
have you caught up on

657
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,640
the two lost days?

658
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,070
Not yet.

659
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,640
I'm still working on it.

660
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,440
They will taste better

661
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,400
when they are in season.

662
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,590
A Chang'an man

663
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,920
has become a litchi expert.

664
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,866
Times are tough.
I had to do my homework.

665
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,960
Do you think His Majesty

666
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,680
knows it's basically impossible

667
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,866
to get litchis from Lingnan

668
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,310
all the way to Chang'an?

669
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,200
Of course he knows.

670
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,466
People said Noble Consort
wanted litchis,

671
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,110
but I doubt it.

672
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,550
Sounds more like some man's promise

673
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,200
to please a woman.

674
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,110
Someone made a big and empty promise.

675
00:29:35,044 --> 00:29:36,000
So, he gave the order.

676
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,200
We can't make such speculations.

677
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,755
Look how scared you are.

678
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,000
Clearly, you're timid by nature,

679
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,000
yet you risk

680
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,480
your neck for this suicide mission.

681
00:29:48,088 --> 00:29:49,622
I've seen hardworking folks

682
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:50,920
and honest folks.

683
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,240
But a hardworking and honest man?

684
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,510
You're the first.

685
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,110
What kind of person are you, really?

686
00:29:57,244 --> 00:29:58,200
A guy from Chang'an.

687
00:29:59,777 --> 00:30:02,266
A low-ranking clerk,
gritting his teeth to survive.

688
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,000
That's all.

689
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,830
But you sure made some waves.

690
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,350
I don't even know how I got
into this mess.

691
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,110
Like these litchis.

692
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,755
They taste sweet to you,

693
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:15,270
but they're bitter to me.

694
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,130
Then why eat them

695
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,750
if they're bitter?

696
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,400
That's life.

697
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,070
Simple as that.

698
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,110
Even if you were a deity,

699
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,270
you wouldn't get everything you want.

700
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,160
Even Taibai Jinxing

701
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,960
might have his woes, right?

702
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,270
In this world,

703
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,640
the heart is never quite at peace.

704
00:30:37,266 --> 00:30:38,488
But the work must be done.

705
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,480
At least your conscience is clear.

706
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,240
One day when you die,

707
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,777
and face King Yama in the underworld,

708
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,640
you get to tell him

709
00:30:45,822 --> 00:30:46,680
you did your best.

710
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,160
That's all.

711
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,400
Why are you so willing

712
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,550
to risk your life?

713
00:30:56,422 --> 00:30:58,133
Ms. Amita, how much money do you have?

714
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,510
Why are you asking that?

715
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:02,240
I have three hundred guan.

716
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,555
One hundred and fifty guan

717
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,240
came from a loan in Chang'an.

718
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,920
With that money,

719
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,480
I bought a house in Chang'an.

720
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,310
Taking out a loan to buy a house?
That's normal.

721
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,480
Sure, that's normal for you.

722
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,070
You can throw money around.

723
00:31:16,177 --> 00:31:17,720
In Lingnan, you could buy as many homes

724
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,480
as you like,

725
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,270
anywhere you want.

726
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,400
But it's different for me.

727
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,510
That house of mine

728
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,480
is for my daughter.

729
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,750
It's my only

730
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,590
hope and goal.

731
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,550
That hope

732
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,110
got interrupted by this litchi mission.

733
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,590
So if I want to go back,

734
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,200
I must

735
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,440
pull this off.

736
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,030
No matter how He Youguang intervenes,

737
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,160
I won't give up.

738
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,030
You asked why I helped you earlier.

739
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,350
Because when I look at you,

740
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,070
I see my father,

741
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,790
who risked everything

742
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,880
just to protect me.

743
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,030
Li Shande, where did you go?

744
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,266
You were gone so long.

745
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,880
I had a meal with Amita.

746
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,000
What scheme is she up to now?

747
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,350
It was just a meal.

748
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,920
That Association lady

749
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,830
rummaged around.

750
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,590
She said she'd come to inspect again.

751
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,640
They've never shown

752
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,440
this much interest.

753
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,888
What are they after?

754
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,110
Now even the troublemakers

755
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,270
have shown up at our doorstep.

756
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,977
You'd better be careful.

757
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,350
What?

758
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,110
Amita hit a merchant?

759
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:47,880
That's right.

760
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,880
Amita's behavior

761
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,666
has become more unruly.

762
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,400
Back then, her father died in a fire.

763
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,720
If you hadn't stepped in

764
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,070
and taken her in,

765
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,750
and gone against all objections

766
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,030
to clear her father's fleet's name

767
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:02,955
and handed it to her,

768
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,577
would she be the Leader?

769
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,200
Yet now,

770
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,088
she doesn't even think of that.

771
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,110
Ma Guiyun has been

772
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,680
wooing Amita lately.

773
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,066
And what is Ma Guiyun capable of?

774
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,350
At best, he's just a messenger

775
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,488
of the Right Chancellor.

776
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,440
He wants Amita?

777
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,244
He's clearly out of his league.

778
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,510
That may be true,

779
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,711
but Ma Guiyun is
the definition of a schemer.

780
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,270
I just worry he might stir up

781
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,400
some real trouble.

782
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,790
What kind of trouble?

783
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,680
Don't worry, Inspector He.

784
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,030
I actually have a plan.

785
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:39,510
Go on.

786
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,330
Lately, Ma Guiyun has been

787
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,350
strutting around like a peacock.

788
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,044
He is relentlessly wooing Amita.

789
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,110
But Amita?

790
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,510
She won't even look at him.

791
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,400
I bet the guy must be boiling over

792
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,110
with frustration.

793
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,720
I just so happen to have an idea.

794
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,550
Send in a young beautiful woman

795
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,790
to play to his tastes.

796
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,933
It may be hard for a guy
to win a lady's heart,

797
00:34:01,955 --> 00:34:03,880
but it's easy for a woman
to earn a guy's favor.

798
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,440
This is the perfect chance

799
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,000
to reel Ma Guiyun in.

800
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,320
But that Ma Guiyun

801
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,880
has eyes for Amita.

802
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,733
So, he's not one
to settle for just anyone.

803
00:34:20,155 --> 00:34:21,230
Got anyone in mind?

804
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,360
Actually, I do.

805
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,355
Mr. Ma.

806
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,710
Miss Lan Yu.

807
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,400
Mr. Ma.

808
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,070
I'm not Ms. Amita,

809
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,920
so are you disappointed?

810
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,070
Not at all.

811
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,320
Miss Lan Yu

812
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,920
heard we were hosting a banquet for you,

813
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,400
so she made a special effort
to dress up.

814
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,880
She will be dancing with you,

815
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,760
just like two birds soaring together

816
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,590
in perfect harmony.

817
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,510
Miss Lan Yu,

818
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,550
you came here alone.

819
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,440
Does Ms. Amita know?

820
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:07,190
I've admired you
for a long time, Mr. Ma.

821
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,590
But unfortunately,

822
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,440
you've never paid anyone else any mind.

823
00:35:13,066 --> 00:35:14,360
In your eyes and in your heart,

824
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,480
there's only our Leader.

825
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,440
Before I came here,

826
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,190
I told her about my feelings for you.

827
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,880
I have her blessing.

828
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,440
Now, you'd stop

829
00:35:23,533 --> 00:35:25,133
bothering her.

830
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,190
That is plain heartless.

831
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,670
I couldn't tell just now.

832
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,710
But look at you two right now...

833
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,590
You make such a lovely pair.

834
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,440
A match that will make anyone jealous.

835
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:38,840
Guiyun,

836
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,030
next time you travel the lands,

837
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,880
you'll have a beauty by your side.

838
00:35:43,244 --> 00:35:45,666
Now that's a whole
different kind of pleasure.

839
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,630
We should toast to that!

840
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,880
Bottoms up!

841
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:55,670
Chief Scribe Zhao.

842
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,400
Please.

843
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:05,666
Chief Scribe Zhao,
you've gone to such lengths

844
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,760
for my sake.

845
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,550
So, is tonight's banquet

846
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,030
really just

847
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,230
to celebrate the bond
between me and Miss Lan Yu?

848
00:36:13,155 --> 00:36:15,400
We haven't seen each other in a while.
Just catching up.

849
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,440
That's all?

850
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,760
Of course! Tonight is all about

851
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,360
you enjoying the food
and drink to your heart's content.

852
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,110
It's pure joy and merriment.

853
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:23,960
Lan Yu,

854
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,400
start the dance.

855
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,800
Let's see you dance!

856
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,577
Come now, Chief Scribe Zhao.

857
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,288
Having a good time?

858
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,400
Seems like it.

859
00:36:55,977 --> 00:36:57,280
Easy there, Chief Scribe Zhao.

860
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:10,840
Mr. Ma.

861
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,150
Miss Lan Yu?

862
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,280
Even without the makeup,

863
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,960
you're truly radiant.

864
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,880
And you are quite the gallant gentleman.

865
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,110
If I didn't know better,

866
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,230
I'd think you were

867
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,550
the host of tonight's feast.

868
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,670
With friends, we drink
to our hearts' content.

869
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,320
You've all treated me so warmly,

870
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,711
I feel right at home.

871
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,355
We are all the same here.

872
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,280
Mr. Ma, I heard,

873
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,488
that just outside
the city lies Mount Pingyun.

874
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,480
It's scenic and lush.

875
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,670
It's worth a visit.

876
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,070
Why don't I accompany you there tomorrow

877
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,320
for a little excursion?

878
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,230
I'm just a lowly girl

879
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,710
with a frail body.

880
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,360
I overestimated myself.

881
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,710
Don't cry, Lan Yu.

882
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,400
Put those tears away.

883
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,110
I can't stand it when women cry.

884
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,880
Mount Pingyun, right?

885
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:18,844
Alright.

886
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,230
Put away the tears.

887
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,150
Mount Pingyun.

888
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,150
Take care, Mr. Ma.

889
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,840
Qilang,

890
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,920
how could you be so easily

891
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,840
charmed?

892
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:43,630
That Lan Yu

893
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,800
is just a pretty face.

894
00:38:46,311 --> 00:38:47,920
Don't tell me you're that weak-willed?

895
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,550
You still have a mission.

896
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,311
Are you really off gallivanting?

897
00:38:54,644 --> 00:38:56,110
With tricks as obvious as hers,

898
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:56,960
she can't fool me.

899
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,840
I'm going along with the flow.

900
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,880
Chief Scribe Zhao must have

901
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,110
invited me for a reason.

902
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,190
I don't know what he wants,

903
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,710
so I can't act rashly,

904
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,280
or burn bridges either.

905
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,320
I must play along for now.

906
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,480
Let's see

907
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,510
what he is really up to.

908
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,030
Qilang, you're brilliant.

909
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:22,190
We are all trying
to sound each other out.

910
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,760
We get the responses,

911
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,280
but nothing concrete.

912
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,688
Everyone also left

913
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,444
some room
for maneuvering in their words.

914
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:32,920
Gou'er, you're still
too young to get it.

915
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,000
You can't take things at face value.

916
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,440
We must plan ahead.

917
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,710
You'll need to trade moves

918
00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:40,622
before the outcome is clear.

919
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,666
I just worry your act
might become a real thing.

920
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,590
You clearly enjoy this whole act.

921
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,190
I bet you like

922
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,400
being courted.

923
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,840
After all,

924
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,280
it's much easier than wooing her.

925
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,511
Romance is profound and deep.

926
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,150
Fake affection can't be real.

927
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,550
Only what's truly felt is real.

928
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,710
You're just a kid.
What do you even know?

929
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,280
I may be young,

930
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,400
but I'm not dumb.

931
00:40:05,622 --> 00:40:07,070
Since we've come to Lingnan,

932
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,710
there've been women around you.

933
00:40:08,977 --> 00:40:10,590
Master Konglang is
a teacher and a friend.

934
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:11,644
She is elegant and wise.

935
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,670
Amita is sharp and fearless,

936
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,510
a match for any man.

937
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,630
And today, the girl is

938
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,510
sweet and charming,

939
00:40:17,511 --> 00:40:19,577
a delicate beauty anyone would cherish.

940
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,550
You really are quite the lucky man.

941
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,311
Gou'er, you're getting sharper.

942
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,622
Starting tomorrow,

943
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,000
stop brushing your teeth.

944
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:30,800
Today,

945
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:31,960
I'll knock out

946
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,670
all of them.

947
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,800
You spill nothing but nonsense.

948
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,110
Where did you learn those phrases?

949
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,550
Have some decency. Get lost.

950
00:40:50,311 --> 00:40:51,333
What are you doing?

951
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,400
My aunt just arrived.

952
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,880
She's Chai, a powerful shaman

953
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,710
from the mountains.

954
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,440
Maybe she can

955
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,800
help us with the delivery.

956
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,360
Wait.

957
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,510
We don't resort to the occult.

958
00:41:01,955 --> 00:41:02,800
We can't pin our hopes

959
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,320
on that kind of thing.

960
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,320
My aunt is the real deal.

961
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,622
She was born with a gift.

962
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,600
For major events of the Dong people,
whether weddings or funerals,

963
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,840
she's the one we turn to.

964
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,030
Whatever matter she handles,

965
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,630
it will go smoothly.

966
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:16,960
Can she tell me

967
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,400
how to preserve litchis?

968
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,710
Probably not.

969
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,440
The deities don't deal

970
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,510
with such tiny details.

971
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,000
It's over! Go on! Get out!

972
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,190
Show's over! Time to go!

973
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:43,150
Li Shande, what are you doing?

974
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,377
What else? I'm saving you all!

975
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,230
What are you doing?

976
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,150
You!

977
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,800
You dare interrupt my ritual?

978
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,550
The deities are watching!

979
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,670
They are angry!

980
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,670
They will punish you for this!

981
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,550
And when have they ever spared me?

982
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,320
This stuff is poisonous.

983
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,440
These are

984
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,540
(Chai)
thorn apple flowers and leaves.

985
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,280
When they are dried and burned,

986
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,030
the fumes cause hallucinations.

987
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:10,960
It's poisonous!

988
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,150
You serious?

989
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,000
Dead serious!

990
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,000
I have

991
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,440
seen it many times.

992
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,070
When we're sick,

993
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,030
we sniff it and feel better.

994
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,400
That doesn't mean you're cured.

995
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,550
It just numbs the pain.

996
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,630
It only masks

997
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,320
your symptoms for a while!

998
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,070
Stop inhaling it!

999
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,630
All of you!

1000
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,800
Will you believe me,

1001
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,630
or do you believe this city folk?

1002
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:35,700
=The Litchi Road=

1003
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,440
I'm not sure what to say.

1004
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,840
Maybe something about poetry or music.

1005
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,190
Or maybe

1006
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,280
a pleasant moonlit stroll.

1007
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:43,840
Moonlit...

1008
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:46,920
Gou'er.

1009
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:48,960
Get out.

1010
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,070
Qilang, I didn't even go in.

1011
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,320
At Dayu Ridge,

1012
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,030
there's a shortcut.

1013
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:56,670
A shortcut?

1014
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:57,150
A shortcut!

1015
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,110
It'll save us two days on the road.

1016
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,360
That's terrific news!

1017
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,400
I need you to find someone in Lingnan.

1018
00:43:04,511 --> 00:43:05,955
A man named Tu from Dayu Ridge.

1019
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,440
He was burned to death ten years ago.

1020
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,360
