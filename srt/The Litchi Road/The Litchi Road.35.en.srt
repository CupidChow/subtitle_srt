=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,940
(Carp)

3
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,060
(March, Lingnan, Gaozhou)
These March carp

4
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,900
are freshly caught.

5
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,650
They're still lively.

6
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,440
They may be small,

7
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,440
but they're perfect for fish fritters.

8
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,330
Look at this.

9
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,100
Its belly is full of spring roe.

10
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,560
Spring roe?

11
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,040
You're not from around here, are you?

12
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,670
No.

13
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,660
Here in Lingnan,

14
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,510
we call fish roe spring roe.

15
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,090
March is the best time to eat them.

16
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,420
If you're truly interested,

17
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,060
I can split the belly,

18
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,088
take out just the roe,
and throw the rest away.

19
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:31,900
What do you say?

20
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,740
Hold on.

21
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:01,770
I got it.

22
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,220
You're not upset

23
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,060
about Mr. Li.

24
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,220
You're troubled by

25
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,888
the envoy the Right Chancellor sent.

26
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,890
You always land on your feet

27
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,040
and have a way with words.

28
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,060
Even if the envoy comes,

29
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,170
what can he do?

30
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,800
Say one more word,

31
00:03:17,444 --> 00:03:18,740
and I'll rip your tongue out

32
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,888
and throw it to Chang'an.

33
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,810
Yes.

34
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,210
Gou'er.

35
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,390
Gou'er.

36
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,330
Gou'er.

37
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:21,810
Mr. Zheng.

38
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,700
I, Carp Sanlang,
greet you, Mr. Zheng.

39
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,180
How did you get in?

40
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,044
How do you know my surname is Zheng?

41
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,210
Where's Gou'er?

42
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,780
Don't be anxious, Qilang.

43
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,200
(Third Young Master of Carp Clan)
I know a bit of divination.

44
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,222
I mean no harm.

45
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,480
I'm here

46
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,250
to repay your kindness.

47
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,140
Jiuniang. Shiyiniang.

48
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,260
- Sir.
- Sir.

49
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,400
Come and thank your savior.

50
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:59,311
- Thank you for saving our lives, Sir.
- Thank you for saving our lives, Sir.

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,840
Who are they?

52
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,620
Why are they thanking me?

53
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,340
Do you remember

54
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,880
the basket of fish

55
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:08,911
you saved from the fisherman
earlier today?

56
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,650
I do.

57
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,530
They are my descendants.

58
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,822
You're a fish lord?

59
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,300
From your bearing, I can tell

60
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:29,866
you're intelligent and refined.

61
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,810
You were surely born to a noble family.

62
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:34,333
You were meant
to have a promising future,

63
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,820
How did things come to this?

64
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:39,990
It's a long story.

65
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,480
I'd rather be a general

66
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,950
than a scholar.

67
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,740
When I was a kid,
I always dreamed of joining the army.

68
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,420
But at that time,

69
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:54,022
my father was falsely accused,

70
00:05:54,244 --> 00:05:56,533
and our family was cast out
from the Zheng clan.

71
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,300
We became commoners.

72
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,050
So I lost my chance

73
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:01,970
to join the army.

74
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:04,970
That's always been

75
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,266
a deep regret in my life.

76
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,340
After Song Wuji died,

77
00:06:10,644 --> 00:06:13,000
I got a chance to approach
the Left Chancellor.

78
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,380
He offered me a chance

79
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,670
to return to the clan.

80
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,060
That's how I came to Lingnan,

81
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,860
living each day on edge,

82
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,300
and walking on eggshells.

83
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,120
All for the hope
that once this task is done,

84
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,420
I can return to the clan,

85
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,220
enlist,

86
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,820
don armor, and fight for Tang

87
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,990
on the battlefield.

88
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,700
You're indeed kind and loyal.

89
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:39,860
You must've come to this world

90
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,490
with a mission.

91
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:43,244
There's a reason behind every cause.

92
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,950
Things will turn in your favor.

93
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,460
I thank you for your kind words.

94
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,170
But lately,

95
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,070
I somehow

96
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,140
can't eat

97
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,170
or sleep well.

98
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,610
Mr. Carp,

99
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,970
you said you know divination.

100
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,740
Could you

101
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,840
read my fortune?

102
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,610
Well...

103
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,066
Is that too much to ask?

104
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,290
Well.

105
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,320
I felt a bond the moment we met.

106
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,660
I'll take a look at your fate.

107
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,000
This is strange.

108
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,660
This calamity is fierce,

109
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,730
but the vision vanishes too quickly.

110
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,250
Perhaps the day is near,

111
00:07:37,844 --> 00:07:39,088
so it can't be seen clearly.

112
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,160
The day is near?

113
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,980
How near?

114
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,530
Tomorrow

115
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,420
is the day of your calamity.

116
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:17,690
Tomorrow?

117
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,280
That means I can't survive

118
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,840
the envoy the Right Chancellor sent.

119
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,530
Qilang,

120
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,820
you may lose your life,

121
00:08:29,822 --> 00:08:31,720
but the sign says
your enemy will perish with you.

122
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,570
But...

123
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,410
Perish with me?

124
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,170
All things follow
the law of cause and effect.

125
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:38,755
They are nothing but a fleeting dream.

126
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:40,200
There's no need to be scared.

127
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,620
Easy for you to say.

128
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,770
I'm just a commoner.

129
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,950
There are so many things I haven't done.

130
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,670
If I die tomorrow...

131
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,640
I don't want to die.

132
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,170
Is there a way to escape it?

133
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,290
Qilang.

134
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,450
Who's that?

135
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,290
Oh, this boy.

136
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,333
He always sleeps without a blanket.

137
00:09:12,355 --> 00:09:13,680
A single thought brings freedom.

138
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,900
That's good.

139
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,780
You're so close to death,

140
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,355
but you still think of others.

141
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:21,780
I shall do all I can

142
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:23,622
to extend your life for sixty more days.

143
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,810
When that day comes,

144
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,300
you'll know.

145
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,550
When you're in danger,

146
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,220
go all the way to the east.

147
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,480
No matter what happens,

148
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,820
don't look back.

149
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,780
Only then can your calamity be lifted.

150
00:09:35,155 --> 00:09:37,955
Otherwise, not even an immortal
can save you.

151
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,940
=Episode 35=

152
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,780
As a Chancellor,
you ought to maintain balance

153
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,860
in every matter.

154
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,260
Between litchis and the country,

155
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,270
how do you

156
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,930
weigh their worth?

157
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,620
Which does His Majesty think

158
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,090
matters?

159
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,080
I've already explained

160
00:10:23,644 --> 00:10:25,800
the pros and cons
of the litchi transport.

161
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,820
Why are you still asking

162
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,866
such foolish questions?

163
00:10:28,866 --> 00:10:30,288
I've never been more clearheaded.

164
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,380
For fresh litchi transport,

165
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,090
do you know

166
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,166
how many trees
in the litchi garden of Lingnan

167
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,222
were cut down?

168
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,180
How many riders risked their lives?

169
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,090
How many horses died from exhaustion?

170
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,100
How many boats were wrecked
in the river?

171
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,900
And how many lives were sacrificed?

172
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,660
In order to deliver fresh litchis,

173
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,330
I lost not only my friends

174
00:10:55,866 --> 00:10:57,222
but also my conscience.

175
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,570
But what came

176
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:00,577
of all that sacrifice?

177
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,610
It brought you favor
from the Noble Consort

178
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,660
and His Majesty.

179
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,410
It brought you the power to show off

180
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,820
in front of all the officials.

181
00:11:09,022 --> 00:11:10,100
You used the entire nation

182
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,220
for your own selfish gain!

183
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,320
You bled the people dry

184
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,510
to feed the dignitaries' desires.

185
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,290
Only now

186
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,780
do I realize

187
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,540
what I actually delivered from Lingnan

188
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,755
through the litchi transport.

189
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,450
This is a mirror.

190
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,180
Emperor Taizong once said,

191
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,780
"With bronze as a mirror,
you can dress properly.

192
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,080
With people as a mirror,
you reflect on your own conduct."

193
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:34,020
Today, the litchi is a mirror.

194
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,400
It reveals loyalty and treachery.

195
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,100
It shows the world

196
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,820
who truly

197
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,290
endangers the court

198
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,440
and deceives His Majesty!

199
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,280
Scoundrel!

200
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,520
Aren't you afraid

201
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,760
you'll lose your head for saying this?

202
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,340
If I die,

203
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,250
let it spread throughout the country
like the litchi tale.

204
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,020
It's the Right Chancellor
who makes His Majesty appear unjust

205
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,980
and tarnishes

206
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,400
his wise reputation.

207
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,070
Li Shande,

208
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,630
you ingrate!

209
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,410
When you were in trouble,

210
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,130
it was the Right Chancellor
who saved you.

211
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,320
How could you

212
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,660
speak against him?

213
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,488
Shut your trap, Softshell Turtle On Top!

214
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:16,530
The like of you

215
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,060
speak the prettiest words

216
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,580
but commit the filthiest deeds.

217
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,620
All this time,

218
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,740
people like you

219
00:12:21,777 --> 00:12:22,980
have clung to the bull's tail,

220
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,540
draining it of every drop of blood

221
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,980
like leeches until nothing remains,

222
00:12:28,022 --> 00:12:28,955
all for your own gain.

223
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:29,820
You all are

224
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,980
but a swarm of moths in power.

225
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,010
Like bunches of litchis

226
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,980
left too long.

227
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,060
Fair on the outside

228
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,570
but rotten to the core inside.

229
00:12:36,577 --> 00:12:37,933
The stench is unbearable!

230
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,180
For all my life, I've been

231
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,280
too cowardly

232
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,980
to serve the ruler

233
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,270
or protect my family.

234
00:12:44,444 --> 00:12:45,330
But there's one thing

235
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,180
I'm proud of.

236
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,311
I have never harmed anyone

237
00:12:47,311 --> 00:12:48,666
and never betrayed my conscience.

238
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,170
Litchi transport
is the greatest mistake of my life.

239
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:52,460
Even if I can't atone for it,

240
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,140
I will not help foment the evil.

241
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,630
I might as well quit.

242
00:12:57,711 --> 00:12:59,111
I will not be remembered

243
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:00,260
in the history books

244
00:13:00,288 --> 00:13:01,777
as a flatterer, a cruel official,

245
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,700
or a lowly man who fawns on the powerful
and tramples the weak.

246
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,540
Scram!

247
00:13:19,338 --> 00:13:21,810
Sir, this man...

248
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,180
Kill Li Shande.

249
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,250
Uncle,

250
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,620
where's my father?

251
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,730
He asked us

252
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,860
to wait for him here.

253
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:48,970
Don't worry.

254
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,010
Xiu'er,

255
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,650
this is for you.

256
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:54,810
Keep it.

257
00:13:55,822 --> 00:13:57,066
Don't let your father find out.

258
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,610
Put it away.

259
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,730
Qilang, Mr. Li is here.

260
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,570
He's here. Hurry.

261
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,180
Father.

262
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,060
Xiu'er.

263
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,900
Father.

264
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,880
Xiu'er.

265
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,600
Let me take a good look at you.

266
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,650
Very well.

267
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:12,650
Ping'an.

268
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,860
Have the fresh litchis arrived?

269
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,840
They have, but...

270
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,120
You don't have to worry about that.

271
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,670
Quick. Let's leave.

272
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,810
Where to?

273
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:21,770
Lingnan.

274
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,780
I'm waiting for an answer.

275
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,150
What answer are you waiting for now?
Come with me.

276
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,780
It's very important to me.

277
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,100
You go on ahead.

278
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,020
Xiu'er, once you reach Lingnan,

279
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,533
you have to listen to your father.

280
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,540
I have many friends there.

281
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,500
I'll take you around when I get there.

282
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,670
Hurry and go on.

283
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:40,900
Come on.

284
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,420
Let's go.

285
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,260
Take care.

286
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,220
Go on.

287
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,460
Don't worry.

288
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,190
Take care, Ping'an.

289
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,290
Take care.

290
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,650
Go on.

291
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:56,890
You must come.

292
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,250
Take care.

293
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,580
Where did he go?

294
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:23,770
There's no one in the house.

295
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,790
My identity as Ma Guiyun

296
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,630
has been exposed.

297
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,100
Let's find a place to hide.

298
00:15:27,355 --> 00:15:28,533
Where are we going then?

299
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,860
Li Shande's old mansion.

300
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:32,930
Come on.

301
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,844
The Right Chancellor
has always taught me

302
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,620
that serving Your Majesty

303
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,950
and the Noble Consort

304
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,860
is our duty.

305
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,820
Though the task may be arduous,

306
00:15:54,311 --> 00:15:55,710
as long as one serves earnestly,

307
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,580
it will succeed.

308
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,900
Lingnan lies 2723.5 km

309
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,700
from Chang'an.

310
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,790
As the Litchi Inspector,

311
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,300
I took loyalty as my horse,
determination as my vessel,

312
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,340
worry as my shelter,
and sincerity as my tool.

313
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,540
With these four,

314
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,130
I brought fresh litchis

315
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,580
back to Chang'an.

316
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,820
I ask for nothing more

317
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,990
than to see Your Majesty pleased

318
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,580
and the Noble Consort gladdened.

319
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,040
With that, I'm content.

320
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,130
Your Majesty,

321
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,010
I reckon,

322
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,820
if rewards are to be given,

323
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,810
none should be overlooked.

324
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,610
I recall

325
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,590
a Litchi Envoy

326
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,360
who wrote

327
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,800
the Litchi Transport Manual.

328
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,060
He went to all offices and departments

329
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,360
to submit his petition.

330
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,140
This incident has become known
to the people.

331
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,280
Surely, his efforts deserve recognition.

332
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,920
Left Chancellor,

333
00:17:03,977 --> 00:17:05,600
you may not know the full account.

334
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,260
This Litchi Envoy

335
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,380
is inexperienced

336
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,866
and never handled procurements.

337
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,300
As for

338
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,500
the manual he wrote,

339
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,300
it's an impractical

340
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,730
theory.

341
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,020
Given the urgent situation,

342
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,022
we couldn't afford to change
the person in charge,

343
00:17:22,022 --> 00:17:23,866
so Attendant Yu was dispatched
to take over

344
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,860
as inspector.

345
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,060
If that is so,

346
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,500
the success

347
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,370
of the litchi transport

348
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,760
owes to the seamless collaboration

349
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,650
between the Right Chancellor's
wise planning

350
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,050
and Attendant Yu's execution.

351
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,840
It's you both who brought us
this grand feast today.

352
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,210
I deeply admire

353
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,380
your service.

354
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,320
Yes.

355
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,810
I commend your efforts.

356
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,410
General Gao,

357
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,130
present the rewards.

358
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

359
00:17:59,088 --> 00:18:01,600
Thank you for your gracious favor,
Your Majesty.

360
00:18:04,911 --> 00:18:06,300
He's not in the embroidery house

361
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:07,740
nor at his home.

362
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,488
He's taking his daughter with him.

363
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,780
He can't go too far.

364
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,490
Sir!

365
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,580
We've searched the whole area.
No sign of him.

366
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,100
Useless bunch.

367
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,370
Sir, we've found something.

368
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,850
Someone saw Li Shande

369
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,660
leaving Qixia Gate with his daughter.

370
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,111
They're heading out of the city.

371
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:31,940
Say that again.

372
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,140
Someone saw Li Shande

373
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,260
heading out of the city.

374
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,660
Attendant Yu ordered us
to kill Li Shande.

375
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,860
He won't get far with a child.

376
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,570
After him!

377
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:48,810
Mister,

378
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:50,866
I heard you're looking for someone.

379
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,020
What's it to you?

380
00:18:52,155 --> 00:18:53,577
Were you talking about Li Shande?

381
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,120
I'm looking for him too.

382
00:18:55,222 --> 00:18:56,800
He borrowed twenty guan from me

383
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,890
and disappeared.

384
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,111
I've been searching for days.

385
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,250
Have you found him?

386
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:02,420
Who are you?

387
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,730
I'm his brother-in-law.

388
00:19:04,133 --> 00:19:05,580
He really did borrow money from me.

389
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,420
Look.

390
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:08,844
Twenty guan.

391
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,210
Look at this.

392
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:06,970
Qilang.

393
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,610
Qilang.

394
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,577
Are you all right, Qilang?

395
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:12,860
You're hurt.

396
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,500
Qilang.

397
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,180
Don't be afraid.

398
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,500
No one

399
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,060
can hurt Xiu'er now.

400
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,020
Let's go. I'll take you
to see a physician.

401
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,380
It's too late.

402
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,540
I won't make it.

403
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,090
Save him.

404
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,022
Save him!

405
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,490
Qilang.

406
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,570
Save him, please.

407
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,540
Gou'er.

408
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,080
Save him...

409
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:06,940
Go to Lingnan and find Li Shande.

410
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,700
He'll take good care of you.

411
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,820
No, Qilang.

412
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,140
Don't leave me.

413
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,260
Save him.

414
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:22,940
Luotuo.

415
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:23,850
I'm here.

416
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:25,580
Tell Master Konglang

417
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,420
I was held up.

418
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,940
I have to break my promise.

419
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,955
I won't be able
to have a drink with her anymore.

420
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:50,977
How I wish I could.

421
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,820
Qilang.

422
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,600
Mr. Zheng.

423
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,330
Qilang?

424
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,780
Qilang.

425
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,330
Mr. Zheng.

426
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:18,030
Qilang!

427
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,900
Qilang!

428
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,100
Qilang!

429
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,650
Qilang...

430
00:22:40,688 --> 00:22:41,850
What are you doing here?

431
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,770
You were heading east.

432
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,300
You could've escaped all this.

433
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,160
Why turn back?

434
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,330
Qilang!

435
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,060
Qilang!

436
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,140
I forgot!

437
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,090
Did you say it?

438
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,400
All I remember is
one moment, it was day,

439
00:23:11,422 --> 00:23:12,533
and the next, it was night.

440
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,777
I thought you were going
to turn me into a fish.

441
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,590
Gou'er!

442
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,710
Qilang!

443
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,340
Are you insane?

444
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,320
What are you doing here?

445
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:05,800
Why?

446
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,020
Qilang,

447
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,570
I was worried
there'd be no one to serve you

448
00:24:10,577 --> 00:24:11,630
in the afterlife.

449
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,980
I'll beat you!

450
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,133
What's gotten into you?

451
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,610
The very first litchi

452
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,720
should be yours, my dear.

453
00:24:38,533 --> 00:24:39,650
Thank you, Your Majesty.

454
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,020
I'll do it.

455
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,050
Your Majesty,

456
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,590
none of the litchis are edible.

457
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,888
They've turned soft
and lost their color and fragrance.

458
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,710
Please don't eat them.

459
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,090
Right Chancellor,

460
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,200
if you couldn't complete this task,

461
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,660
you should've explained it
to His Majesty.

462
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,740
His Majesty is magnanimous.

463
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,540
He wouldn't have blamed you.

464
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:06,140
Yet you made a promise beyond you,

465
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,600
that's why this happened.

466
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:10,880
Not only

467
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,780
did you fail to bring glory
to our country,

468
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,480
but you also gave others an excuse

469
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:17,060
to mock the Tang

470
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,970
for making empty promises.

471
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:23,910
You handled this very poorly.

472
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:31,300
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

473
00:26:31,844 --> 00:26:33,244
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

474
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,950
When the litchis first arrived,

475
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,711
they were bright and fresh.

476
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,260
I had no idea

477
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,960
they had rotten inside.

478
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,100
This is my fault.

479
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:49,750
My mistake.

480
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,460
I was deceived by appearances

481
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:53,880
and made a grave mistake.

482
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,260
But Your Majesty,

483
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:00,570
I suspect something is amiss.

484
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,440
Why were apples added?

485
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:14,770
Inspector Yu,

486
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,900
Mr. Li said apples would
help the litchis ripen

487
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,510
so that His Majesty
and Noble Consort

488
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,044
could enjoy the fruit at its sweetest.

489
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,100
Send this letter

490
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,900
(To Zheng Ping'an)
to the address.

491
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,180
It must arrive

492
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,422
before we return to Chang'an.

493
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,010
(Ping'an,)

494
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:41,540
(I kept both litchis
and apples together)

495
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,155
(so they'd rot from within
while appearing fresh outside.)

496
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,380
(Litchis are rare tributes.)

497
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,540
(No one would dare to taste the fruit.)

498
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,533
(Please inform the Left Chancellor
about our plan.)

499
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,210
Please announce me.

500
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:54,660
I wish to see Deputy Director Lu.

501
00:27:54,711 --> 00:27:56,133
There's something I need to report.

502
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:59,580
(This could bring down
Right Chancellor during the banquet.)

503
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,420
(Once it's done, meet me at Qixia Gate.)

504
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,980
(We'll leave Chang'an together.)

505
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,690
I see it now.

506
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,260
I see it now.

507
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,533
I see it now, Your Majesty.

508
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:12,770
Your Majesty,

509
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:13,940
someone must be jealous

510
00:28:14,022 --> 00:28:15,600
of our success in the litchi transport

511
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,080
and tampered with the tribute.

512
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,140
You admitted no one else

513
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,800
was involved in the litchi transport.

514
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,140
How could others

515
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,660
have tampered with it?

516
00:28:28,444 --> 00:28:30,555
It must be the problem
with the transport manual.

517
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,110
I merely followed the manual.

518
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,560
You knew it was impractical,

519
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,500
yet still followed it.

520
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,260
Is this how you carry out your duty?

521
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,690
Your Highness,

522
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,580
I was only obeying orders.

523
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,180
Trust me.

524
00:28:47,911 --> 00:28:49,244
Your Majesty, please judge wisely.

525
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,000
Since the start of the year,

526
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,260
I've been supervising the trade

527
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,700
with Tibet and the Uyghurs.

528
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,300
It involves foreign affairs

529
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,740
so I had to oversee everything

530
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,340
personally,

531
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,177
and I didn't want to fail my duty.

532
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,280
I had no time to spare,

533
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,860
so I entrusted the litchi transport

534
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:13,120
to Attendant Yu entirely.

535
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,980
I didn't know you wretched servant

536
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,660
would handle it so carelessly.

537
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,630
I have failed Your Majesty.

538
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,380
Please punish me

539
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,590
for my negligence.

540
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:33,380
Please investigate, Your Majesty.

541
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,330
Litchis spoil easily

542
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,060
by nature. Plus, they were delivered
over 2500 km

543
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,540
from Lingnan to Chang'an.

544
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,860
It took the entire country's efforts
to accomplish this task.

545
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:44,866
Your Majesty,

546
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,510
even though I failed this task,

547
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,155
I've earned merit for the hardship.

548
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:51,030
Please spare my life, Your Majesty.

549
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:57,460
Your Majesty, if you allow me,

550
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,240
I must speak up.

551
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,940
Attendant Yu claims

552
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,860
he has mobilized the entire country

553
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,420
to deliver fresh litchis from Lingnan

554
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,190
so I could taste them.

555
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,420
Doesn't that make me

556
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,020
a wasteful consort

557
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,000
who leaves the people high and dry?

558
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,620
If the litchi transport succeeds,

559
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,150
the credit goes to you.

560
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,530
If it fails,

561
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:23,600
the blame is mine.

562
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:27,210
Attendant Yu, you're indeed clever.

563
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,460
I wouldn't dare.

564
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,200
I deserve to die.

565
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,022
Please spare me, Your Highness.

566
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,190
Look at this.

567
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,410
Look at what you've done.

568
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,020
You've ruined

569
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,900
a joyful day.

570
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,280
You killed the joy.

571
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,560
Your Majesty, I have something to say.

572
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,870
In my opinion,

573
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,560
this might be something
worth celebrating.

574
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,050
Congratulations,

575
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,780
Your Majesty.

576
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,340
Why is that, Left Chancellor?

577
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:10,850
Your Majesty,

578
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,020
if the litchis were successfully
delivered,

579
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,300
it may have preserved

580
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,780
the dignity of Tang,

581
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:20,010
but Your Majesty would never have seen

582
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,270
that some hearts

583
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,840
have already rotten,

584
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,580
just like these litchis.

585
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,060
What are you trying to say?

586
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,340
Speak it plainly.

587
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,260
The litchis may have spoiled,

588
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,220
but I believe the Right Chancellor

589
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,790
has made a fortune out of it

590
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,040
as much as he could.

591
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,050
Left Chancellor,

592
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,640
like I said just now,

593
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,300
the litchi transport

594
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,980
was handled entirely
by this wretched servant.

595
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,900
I'm afraid His Majesty

596
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:00,540
could see through your slander.

597
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:04,610
Your Majesty,

598
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,340
for what happened today,

599
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,220
it's likely to be a trap

600
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,290
set by the Left Chancellor.

601
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:15,210
He first sabotaged the litchis

602
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:19,220
and then set me up with it.

603
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,010
Left Chancellor,

604
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,760
are you attempting
to sow chaos in court?

605
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,820
I have evidence.

606
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:29,930
Your Majesty,

607
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,930
this is a ledger.

608
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,460
It contains proof

609
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,300
of the corruption

610
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,860
of Inspector He Youguang of Gaozhou
over the years.

611
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,450
It records the details

612
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:43,490
of the thirty million guan bribe
he funneled to the Right Chancellor,

613
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,100
including

614
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,660
dates, locations,

615
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,060
and names.

616
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,340
All can be verified.

617
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,780
Please judge it fairly, Your Majesty.

618
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,050
Your Majesty,

619
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,700
I have always served loyally.

620
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,970
I have never associated
with outside officials.

621
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,660
He Youguang

622
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,840
took his life out of fear.

623
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,740
There's no one left
to verify the accusation.

624
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:07,890
That's why

625
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,760
the Left Chancellor uses it against me.

626
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:10,810
Your Majesty,

627
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,720
do not trust him.

628
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,700
Coincidentally,

629
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,160
I have a letter of pledge.

630
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,220
He Youguang addressed this

631
00:33:22,422 --> 00:33:24,266
to the Right Chancellor
while he was alive.

632
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,333
Please present it to His Majesty.

633
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,980
You've truly opened my eyes.

634
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,150
Jinniang,

635
00:34:23,466 --> 00:34:24,860
I've brought Xiu'er to visit you.

636
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,820
We're leaving Chang'an.

637
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,100
I once thought

638
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,820
(Late Beloved Wife, Zheng)

639
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,755
that after delivering the litchis
to Chang'an,

640
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,880
I'd finally secure

641
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,680
(Tomb of Jinniang)
a bright future.

642
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,740
(Husband, Li Shande)

643
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,060
However,

644
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,700
the closer I got to success,

645
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,422
the more disgusted I became.

646
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,340
That being said,

647
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,200
I've fulfilled my duty without regrets.

648
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,950
Actually, I did deliver

649
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,900
the litchis here.

650
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,140
It's sweet, Father.

651
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:47,860
I heard

652
00:35:47,911 --> 00:35:50,288
His Majesty punished
the Right Chancellor severely

653
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,260
and ordered Attendant Yu

654
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,300
to be hanged.

655
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,100
It was to grant him a dignified death.

656
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,820
But during the execution,

657
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,420
a fire broke out in his quarters.

658
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:02,150
His body was burned beyond recognition.

659
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,180
That's retribution.

660
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:06,955
He's committed so many vile deeds

661
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,920
that Heaven wouldn't spare him.

662
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,140
His body couldn't even remain whole.

663
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,140
Where did you hear all this from?

664
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,860
It's spreading through the city.

665
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,260
I also heard

666
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,860
that the Left Chancellor
pleaded for the Litchi Envoy,

667
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,580
saying that he was an upright official.

668
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,430
So His Majesty showed mercy

669
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,220
and spared his life.

670
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,870
Sir, rumors

671
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,750
don't start without cause.

672
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,460
Are they really true?

673
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:47,850
They are rumors. Don't believe them all.

674
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,430
Not entirely.

675
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,300
(Several Months Later)

676
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,690
♪Red-skinned fruit hangs from the tree♪

677
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:03,930
♪Thin branches bending low♪

678
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:08,260
♪Picking one by one wears you out♪

679
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:13,550
♪Better to slice off a whole bunch♪

00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:16,020
♪One bite, and it's sweet as can be♪

681
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,860
Concentrate.

682
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,500
Are you still angry with my father?

683
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,210
Let him replant the litchi trees

684
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,700
he promised me.

685
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,666
If they start growing leaves,
then I'll decide.

686
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,270
Don't worry about that.

687
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,266
Focus on your writing.

688
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:34,140
Liangyuan!

689
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,220
(To Li Shande)

690
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,780
A letter from Chang'an!

691
00:37:38,044 --> 00:37:39,010
The letter has arrived?

692
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,290
Thank you.

693
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,340
Has Mr. Su replied?

694
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,570
Not yet.

695
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:45,620
But don't worry.

696
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,300
I've talked to the merchants.

697
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,460
If they see Mr. Su,

698
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,244
they'll be sure to pass on your message.

699
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,580
I believe Mr. Su has forgiven you.

700
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:54,900
Well, stay and have a meal.

701
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,050
No.

702
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:58,380
My wife is about to give birth.

703
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:01,990
Don't forget to come to
my child's hundred-day banquet.

704
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,929
- I'm off.
- Careful.

705
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:03,700
Be careful.

706
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,460
(Liangyuan, for so many years,)

707
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:15,822
(you've been working tirelessly
to own a house in Chang'an.)

708
00:38:15,844 --> 00:38:17,555
(Just as your wish was about
to come true,)

709
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:19,060
(you gave it all up.)

710
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,420
(To your former colleagues,)

711
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,700
(that must've felt worse than death.)

712
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,180
(Chief Liu said you were a fool.)

713
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,060
(You turned away)

714
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,900
(from the prosperous Chang'an.)

715
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:31,970
(But I know)

716
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,820
(you didn't do it for your career)

717
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,180
(or family.)

718
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,020
(You did it for what you believe in.)

719
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,460
(Because if you hadn't,)

720
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,680
(you would've been miserable.)

721
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:45,940
(It all started)

722
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,660
(with a casual sigh
from the Noble Consort)

723
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,820
(and ended in her lament.)

724
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:51,900
(Throughout,)

725
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,100
(all were caught in it,)

726
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,060
(sparing no effort.)

727
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:57,940
(As for the court's laws,)

728
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,500
(they were like a clumsy troupe)

729
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,300
(playing accompaniment)

730
00:39:03,755 --> 00:39:05,533
(to a grand
Sogdian Whirl dance performance)

731
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:06,570
(behind a distant veil.)

732
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:10,620
(Now, it seems the dust has settled,)

733
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,800
(but the undercurrents still run deep.)

734
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:14,620
(Some cling to it,)

735
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,060
(and some let go.)

736
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,060
(They're just jumping from one trap)

737
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,340
(into another.)

738
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:22,180
(I envy you)

739
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:24,300
(that you can live a carefree life)

740
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,700
(in Lingnan,)

741
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,330
(no longer trapped)

742
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,690
(in Chang'an's whirlpool.)

743
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,580
(Maybe it's a blessing
of this misfortune.)

744
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,540
(Lantern Festival, Chang'an)

745
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:24,060
Life is as fleeting as morning dew.

746
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,380
Since you're here in Chang'an,

747
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:28,170
why don't you stay?

748
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,020
If it's heads,

749
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:41,900
I'll stay.

750
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,500
Today is the Lantern Festival.

751
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,120
Let's light a lantern.

752
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,140
Look.

753
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,580
I made you this lantern.

754
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,420
Is it nice?

755
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:17,170
Let's hang it up.

756
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:18,210
Father,

757
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:19,410
we're here in Lingnan.

758
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:20,960
Can Mother see us?

759
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,150
Of course.

760
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,460
No matter where we are,

761
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,060
your mother

762
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,320
will protect us from above.

763
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:37,940
And your uncle too.

764
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:39,300
Mother,

765
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:40,490
I know

766
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,500
you were afraid I'd be upset,

767
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:44,570
so the osmanthus tree

768
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,900
didn't bloom.

769
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:48,100
But now, Father and I are safe.

770
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,300
I believe this year,

771
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,580
it'll bloom in full.

772
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:13,810
(Mother.)

773
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:14,850
(Uncle.)

774
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,300
(Do you see it?)

775
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,340
(The osmanthus tree is blooming.)

776
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,540
And that ends

777
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,210
Li Shande's story.

778
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:28,711
There's another book called
"The Everlasting Regret".

779
00:42:29,044 --> 00:42:30,577
We'll talk about it if there's time.

780
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,420
What happened to Li Shande afterward?

781
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:34,250
Right.

782
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:35,980
Did he ever return to Chang'an?

783
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,450
Did he?

784
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,410
Right.

785
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,380
Did he return to Chang'an?

786
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,950
There's a hint in the book.

787
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,400
Later,

788
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,850
Chang'an goes through a great upheaval.

789
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:48,940
But Li Shande is in Lingnan.

790
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,660
He escapes it all.

791
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:53,820
Just as the old saying goes,

792
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:56,250
"What goes around,

793
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:58,020
comes around."

794
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:01,230
No evil can happen to a good man.

795
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,140
If you understand, show the sign.

796
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,140
Understood!

797
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:08,980
