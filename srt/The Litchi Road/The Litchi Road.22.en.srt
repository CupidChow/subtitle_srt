00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,999
=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,980
(A Radish Peeling Knife: Three)

3
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,120
You saved my life.

4
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,880
Take this.

5
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,150
I don't want it.

6
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,640
What do you want?

7
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,510
Revenge.

8
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,350
What is your name?

9
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,600
Dongxue.

10
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,200
Your real name.

11
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,680
Yun Qing.

12
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,400
You're heading far away

13
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,020
to Lingnan.

14
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,888
Who knows when we'll meet again.

15
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,533
I remade the sheath.

16
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,030
Take it.

17
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,110
The carrot knife.

18
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,070
Don't forget

19
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,190
your vow.

20
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Take care.

21
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,400
I should get going.

22
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,200
Say,

23
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,688
what is your name?

24
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,110
Yun Qing.

25
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,560
What do you go by now?

26
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,560
Master Konglang.

27
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,140
=Episode 22=

28
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,230
Tie it well.

29
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,644
Make sure they're tight.

30
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:30,360
Do it carefully.

31
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,120
Sit steady.

32
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,960
Lift it.

33
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,000
Tighten it.

34
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,950
Come. Those at the back.

35
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,910
Tighten it.

36
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,310
All the money is ready.

37
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:42,940
Here.

38
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,150
Mr. Li.

39
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,430
Hold in.

40
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,430
Mr. Li, keep it safe.

41
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,830
I...

42
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,870
I heard

43
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,040
Amita is in trouble.

44
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,360
Something went off with the association.
This money...

45
00:05:58,868 --> 00:06:00,398
Since you already know,

46
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,870
I'll be honest with you.

47
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,680
It's better to rely on yourself.

48
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,000
A few days ago,

49
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,840
I

50
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,750
pawned my jewelry

51
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,360
and sold off my ship.

52
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,000
You're giving everything you have.

53
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,600
Calm down.

54
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,720
Don't worry, Mr. Li.

55
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,244
Tie it tighter.

56
00:06:22,244 --> 00:06:22,880
All right.

57
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,240
- All right.
- Good.

58
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,160
All good.

59
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,750
As Confucius said,

60
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,000
"If you want to establish yourself,

61
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,066
help others do the same."

62
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Helping you is helping myself.

63
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,430
I'm betting on a chance

64
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,630
that you'll succeed.

65
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,630
One day,

66
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,977
you'll make a name for yourself,

67
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,160
rise in rank, grow wealthy,

68
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:47,444
and have a full house
of wives and concubines.

69
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,080
When that day comes,

70
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,720
maybe I'll have a chance

71
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,510
to turn my life around.

72
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:53,800
Is everything all right?

73
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,160
Yes.

74
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,600
Good. I'll go get ready.

75
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,390
Get ready to go.

76
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,240
I'm willing to risk everything for you

77
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,560
without regrets.

78
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,630
I'll do my very best.

79
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,720
Very well.

80
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,430
I won't let down your great kindness.

81
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,920
All is set.

82
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,110
Li Shande,

83
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,560
time to go.

84
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,400
All right.

85
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,320
Tong,

86
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,120
once I return here next time,

87
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,630
no one will bully you.

88
00:07:42,866 --> 00:07:44,111
No one dares to bully me.

89
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,880
Li,

90
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,160
take good care of yourself.

91
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,320
Get up.

92
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,520
Get up.

93
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,350
Mr. Li.

94
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,000
Mr. Su.

95
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,600
The journey ahead is long

96
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,830
and perilous.

97
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,600
You'll have to ride
through day and night

98
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,680
in harsh weather.

99
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,790
Do take care of yourself.

100
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,080
I will.

101
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,230
I...

102
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
I have

103
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,360
so many silly things I want to say.

104
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,750
Just one more.

105
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,000
Don't forget I'm waiting for you
in Lingnan.

106
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,600
Don't throw your life away

107
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,030
for honor.

108
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,560
If I must die,

109
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,870
let it be for my country.

110
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:06,200
I'm off.

111
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,200
Let's move out.

112
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,280
Yes, sir.

113
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,960
Be careful. Stay safe.

114
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,600
Safe trip.

115
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,440
We'll be waiting for you.

116
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,280
We will wait for you.

117
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,377
This is as far as we'll send you.

118
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,750
We've delayed a while.

119
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,840
Li Shande will take the Mei Pass.

120
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:03,280
Hurry and catch up with him.

121
00:10:03,355 --> 00:10:05,133
Master Konglang has made
the arrangements.

122
00:10:05,222 --> 00:10:06,320
Once you're in Chang'an,

123
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,711
Deputy Director Lu
from Security Bureau will contact you.

124
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,280
I'm truly grateful.

125
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:14,600
I'll definitely repay your kindness.

126
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:16,311
All right. You should be on your way.

127
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,230
Inspector He,

128
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,390
I didn't let you down.

129
00:10:30,688 --> 00:10:33,260
Lately, I've straightened out
all the affairs of the association.

130
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,960
Everything is running smoothly.

131
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,480
To be honest,

132
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,480
I used to admire Amita
for her decisiveness

133
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:44,750
in handling every business.

134
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,720
But now, when I'm in her seat,

135
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,911
I realize I can do it too.

136
00:10:49,511 --> 00:10:52,000
All thanks to you for recognizing
a hidden gem like me.

137
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:54,150
Inspector He,
you have discerning eyes for talent.

138
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,670
You're my benefactor.

139
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,000
Since I took this position,

140
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,720
those riff-raff have run away.

141
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,840
Even Su Liang was so impressed

142
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,870
that he gave up vying for
the chief title.

143
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,720
He sold off his ship and retired.

144
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,200
What did you say?

145
00:11:14,222 --> 00:11:15,910
Su Liang sold his ship?

146
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,470
He did.

147
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,110
Come closer.

148
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,720
Why did he sell his ship?

149
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,600
Maybe

150
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,600
I'm too powerful,

151
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,288
and he threw in the towel.

152
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,360
Do you have a chicken brain?

153
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,120
You're an idiot.

154
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,910
Isn't it obvious?

155
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,030
Su Liang sold his ship to raise money.

156
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,960
All the major Hu merchants

157
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,688
have pulled out
from the delivery project.

158
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,288
He's betting everything on Li Shande.

159
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,280
Do you understand?

160
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,360
Yes. Got it.

161
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,200
Zhao!

162
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,150
Chief Scribe Zhao!

163
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,840
He said

164
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,720
Su Liang sold his ship.

165
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,440
I'm here.

166
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,750
What's the matter, Inspector He?

167
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,630
Zhao,

168
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,200
head to the litchi garden

169
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,080
and find out what Li Shande is doing.

170
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,360
If he's transporting the litchis,

171
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,630
stop him.

172
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,240
Yes, sir.

173
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,230
Go now.

174
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,990
Tell me.

175
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,510
Who the heck

176
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,080
bought his ship?

177
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,000
I'll look into it right away.

178
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,920
Get lost.

179
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,120
Chief Scribe Zhao,

180
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,644
why did you suddenly summon me back?

181
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,080
Hurry and send your men

182
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,000
to go after Li Shande.

183
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,230
Li Shande?

184
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,710
What about him?

185
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:17,555
I went to the litchi garden just now,

186
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:19,600
but Li Shande was
on his way back to Chang'an.

187
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,440
He's already...

188
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,030
You, get over here.

189
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,200
That slave from Linyi!

190
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,750
Get over here! Now!

191
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,390
Run on!

192
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,200
Kneel.

193
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,960
Tell me.

194
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,790
Did Li Shande run away?

195
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,270
Yes.

196
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,360
I... You rascal!

197
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,088
Why didn't you report it to me?

198
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:44,840
Chief Scribe Zhao.

199
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,744
I'll beat you to death.

200
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:46,977
Where do I go to chase Li Shande?

201
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,320
I heard there were four test routes.

202
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,440
First, Mei Pass.

203
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,688
Second, West Capital Circuit.

204
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,120
Third, a northward waterway.

205
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,329
It'll cross the Yangtze River.

206
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,490
The fourth is also by water.

207
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,110
If we rule out the two water routes,

208
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:05,080
that leaves Mei Pass and West Capital.

209
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,000
A few days ago,

210
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,270
he kept looking for a shortcut.

211
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,360
He said it could save travel time.

212
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,240
I guess it must be the Mei Pass.

213
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,600
Mei Pass.

214
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,630
Take the Mei Pass route

215
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,555
to go after Li Shande.

216
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,150
Hunt him down. Quick!

217
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,030
You slave!

218
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,030
You slave!

219
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,750
He must've gone

220
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,630
to warn Li Shande.

221
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,150
After him.

222
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,200
Stop him!

223
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,230
Stop right there.

224
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,200
Stop!

225
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,350
Stop!

226
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,040
Stop!

227
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,560
Give chase.

228
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,200
Don't you run.

229
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,840
Oh.

230
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,390
Very good.

231
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,800
Inspector He,

232
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,550
we've found a lead on Amita.

233
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,440
She fled to the port.

234
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,870
I've sent more men to search.

235
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,960
We've also intercepted

236
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,555
all outbound ships.

237
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,960
I believe...

238
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,230
Cramp?

239
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,440
Slowly.

240
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,280
Don't sit.

241
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,350
This will help.

242
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,440
Good.

243
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
To let the wound heal,

244
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,600
you have to walk slowly.

245
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,390
Go on.

246
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,790
If everything goes as planned,

247
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,670
we'll bring Amita back

248
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,040
in no time.

249
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,000
Even if Li Shande

250
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,480
arrives in Chang'an,

251
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,444
there's nothing much he can do.

252
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,240
He'll be like a chicken
who loses his legs,

253
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,720
completely tied down.

254
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,080
I think

255
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,200
he's just putting on a show
to the imperial court,

256
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,480
pretending he's done his best,

257
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,360
and there are reasons

258
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,840
for his failure.

259
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,480
It's not the war's fault.

260
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,630
Slowly.

261
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,390
That's right. Turn around.

262
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,030
That slave from Linyi.

263
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,120
This rascal

264
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,270
betrayed us.

265
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,044
I've noticed it.

266
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,840
I didn't expose him

267
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,600
because I wanted to use him

268
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,550
in our plan

269
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,150
when the time was right.

270
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,600
With him leading the way,

271
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,030
we'll soon catch Li Shande

272
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,790
for sure.

273
00:16:47,718 --> 00:16:48,840
Knock it off.

274
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,910
For sure?

275
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,550
Have you ever

276
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,110
beaten Li Shande once?

277
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,200
Everyone, practice with me.

278
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,350
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

279
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,590
I spared him

280
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,030
only because he was in Lingnan

281
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,310
as the Litchi Envoy.

282
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,880
I couldn't kill him.

283
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,390
But now,

284
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,110
he's left Lingnan

285
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,350
and gone into the wild.

286
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,840
His life

287
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,440
is no longer

288
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,920
my concern.

289
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,720
Delicious.

290
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,750
May you stay healthy

291
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,670
and live a long life.

292
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,630
Tell me

293
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,310
which route Li Shande took.

294
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,920
I want to repay Mr. Li's kindness.

295
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,480
(Do you have a name?)

296
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,960
(I'll give you one.)

297
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,920
(I'll give you a name.)

298
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,070
(I'll call you Li.)

299
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,960
He said

300
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,640
he'd

301
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,070
bring me

302
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,840
fine liquor

303
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,680
from Chang'an...

304
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,960
(From now on, you're with me.)

305
00:18:46,155 --> 00:18:47,666
(There's no need to be afraid.)

306
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,920
(I won't hurt you.)

307
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,680
Mr. Li,

308
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,680
thanks to you...

309
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,110
I'm being treated as a human being.

310
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,670
It's worth it.

311
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,510
I did

312
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,030
my best

313
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,933
as a friend...

314
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,444
Li.

315
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,160
(Once I get back here,)

316
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,310
(I'll come pick you up)

317
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,844
(from the Inspector's Office.)

318
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,720
Inspector He,

319
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:41,309
here's a letter from Captain Yang.

320
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,590
He said the slave from Linyi

321
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,680
led them the wrong way,

322
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,622
and he was dead.

323
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,440
He never told them

324
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,070
which route Li Shande took.

325
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,790
They're a day behind.

326
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,111
There's no way to catch up.

327
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,280
Get lost.

328
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,590
Yes.

329
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,080
Uh...

330
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,640
Didn't you say you'd catch him for sure?

331
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,480
Captain Yang

332
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,550
was misled

333
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,550
by the slave from Linyi.

334
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,550
I kept saying Li Shande must've

335
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,110
taken the route through the Mei Pass.

336
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,510
What nonsense are you spewing?

337
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,790
I didn't know

338
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,733
- the slave could be such a snide!
- Shut up.

339
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,590
You always play the wise man
after the fact.

340
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,070
Have you ever gotten anything done?

341
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,480
By the time you do,

342
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,830
it'll be too late.

343
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,070
Right now,

344
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,350
bring Captain Yang back.

345
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,640
Our top priority

346
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,160
is to find Amita

347
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,440
at all costs.

348
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:32,960
Yes.

349
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,510
I'll cast a wide net to search for her.

350
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:35,910
Stop right there.

351
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,640
Chief Scribe Zhao,

352
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,200
if you mess up again,

353
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,590
how should I deal with you?

354
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,510
I'd rather not
recklessly answer something

355
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,066
that won't happen.

356
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,590
Mr. Li.

357
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,440
What's wrong, Mr. Li?

358
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,488
Are you all right, Mr. Li?

359
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,200
Do you need to rest?

360
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,720
I'm fine.

361
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,720
You all go ahead.

362
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,070
I'll catch up after a rest.

363
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,400
Go ahead.

364
00:22:19,022 --> 00:22:20,150
Shande has gone.

365
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,430
Gou'er,

366
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,110
are you happier in Chang'an

367
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,750
or in Lingnan?

368
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,880
- As long as I'm with you,
- As long as I'm with you,

369
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,555
- I'm happy anywhere.
- I'm happy anywhere.

370
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,000
Can you say something new?

371
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,133
You always say nice things.

372
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,000
Do you know what I'm thinking right now?

373
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,200
I want to go back to Chang'an.

374
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,160
You...

375
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,000
You guess wrong.

376
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,510
Mr. Li is back.

377
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,440
Quick.

378
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,280
Where's he?

379
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,755
Come on and help him. Hurry.

380
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,790
Mr. Li. Hurry up!

381
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,110
Be careful, Mr. Li.

382
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,950
Give him a hand.

383
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,880
Slowly.

384
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,270
Go.

385
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:22,880
Get inside.

386
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,750
Get inside. Quick.

387
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:26,830
Mr. Li.

388
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,350
You'll handle the rest.

389
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,920
Hurry up.

390
00:23:33,355 --> 00:23:35,466
Yan Yazhuang will wait for you
at the next stop.

391
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:44,870
Hurry and go.

392
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,355
Fortunately, you made it here.

393
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,920
If you'd collapsed in the wild,

394
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,688
you'd have died before the litchis.

395
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,750
I'm not young anymore.

396
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,440
My body can't keep up.

397
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,955
I read your ledgers.

398
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,920
That mass of detail

399
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,240
speaks to your devotion.

400
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,070
People can't imagine

401
00:24:32,177 --> 00:24:33,640
how carefully you had to calculate

402
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,960
the cost of every single litchi

403
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,800
sent to Chang'an.

404
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,590
That painstaking ledger

405
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,133
must've worn you down.

406
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,030
A single detail

407
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,110
could affect the whole delivery.

408
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,480
Let's go.

409
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,760
Where are you going?

410
00:24:56,177 --> 00:24:57,680
To catch up with the transport team.

411
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,030
You can't ride in your condition.

412
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,350
Even if I fail,

413
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,510
I want to know

414
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,640
how far

415
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,440
from the destination

416
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,550
before I fall.

417
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,350
Mr. Li, easy.

418
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,640
Be extra careful.

419
00:25:28,488 --> 00:25:29,670
You've suffered enough.

420
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:32,680
Be careful.

421
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,110
We're off.

422
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,430
Mr. Li.

423
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,830
Are you all right, Yan?

424
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,670
I'm fine.

425
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,440
Glad to hear that.

426
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,840
Mr. Li,

427
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,760
I'm sorry.

428
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,600
I couldn't make it to Chang'an.

429
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,066
I only reached the mouth
of the Dan River by the eleventh day.

430
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,480
You did your best.

431
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,550
Unfortunately,

432
00:28:33,133 --> 00:28:34,680
I didn't see the freshness of the litchi

433
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,790
before it started to spoil.

434
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,110
Mr. Li.

435
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,320
Mr. Li.

436
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,800
Let me see.

437
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,800
Let me see.

438
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,040
Mr. Li,

439
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,550
I'll check it for you.

440
00:29:03,866 --> 00:29:05,688
Let me taste it
on behalf of His Majesty.

441
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,320
How does it taste?

442
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,840
How?

443
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,510
Sweet. It's sweet.

444
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,555
That's what the trial is for.

445
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,288
If we launch the delivery,

446
00:29:28,311 --> 00:29:29,270
it will work.

447
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,150
Great.

448
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,750
Very well.

449
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,630
Mr. Li,

450
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,350
my mission is done.

451
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,155
I should head home now.

452
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,440
If you ever need me,

453
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,110
just send a word.

454
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,030
No matter where I am,

455
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,044
I'll come.

456
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,080
Yan...

457
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,790
A bosom friend afar

458
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,270
brings a distant land near.

459
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,350
Let's not part with tears

460
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,155
like those young men and women.

461
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,400
Take care, Yan.

462
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,960
Take care, Mr. Li.

463
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,520
Mr. Li!

464
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,720
You're awake.

465
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:54,950
Where am I?

466
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,720
A place beyond the mundane world.

467
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,630
Well,

468
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,400
where's my companion?

469
00:31:08,244 --> 00:31:10,800
She went up to the mountain
to collect herbs with a servant.

470
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,430
Oh, a Taoist Priest.

471
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,333
Thank you for saving me.

472
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,160
May I ask,

473
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,550
how far is it

474
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,440
from here to Chang'an?

475
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,180
(Changyuan)

476
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,390
Chang'an?

477
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:51,622
Oh, the mercy of the Tao.

478
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,960
So you were in such a rush

479
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,977
heading to Chang'an?

480
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,870
Why go there?

481
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,830
I came from Lingnan

482
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,920
on an imperial mission

483
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,590
to deliver litchis to Chang'an.

484
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,920
You deliver litchis

485
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,288
to Chang'an?

486
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,720
That's unbelievable.

487
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,320
Fine.

488
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:27,222
There's no need to stain my sanctuary

489
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,750
and disturb my peace

490
00:32:28,977 --> 00:32:30,444
with such worldly matters.

491
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,110
I noticed

492
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,640
your eyes lost focus

493
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:36,444
and your forehead darkened.

494
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,466
It's a sign of weak heart and spleen.

495
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:44,244
Turns out
this is what's wearing you out.

496
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,680
This mission of mine

497
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,110
is overwhelmingly

498
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,680
detailed and complicated

499
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,550
like cow hairs.

500
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,044
People can barely imagine it.

501
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,750
These past few months,

502
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:06,270
I felt possessed

503
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,444
by those ancient genius mathematicians,

504
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,577
as if I'd entered a realm of emptiness.

505
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:13,830
I wanted to

506
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:14,960
crack open my skull

507
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,920
and smear my brain

508
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,310
on the scrolls

509
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,310
to figure out

510
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,577
the delivery method.

511
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,350
You've lost yourself

512
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,000
in a maze

513
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,444
of confusion and struggle.

514
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:28,311
This is what you really want?

515
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,640
The litchi delivery

516
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,822
concerns my entire family's safety.

517
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,640
If I fail,

518
00:33:37,288 --> 00:33:38,350
their lives are at stake.

519
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,640
For the sake of your family,

520
00:33:42,066 --> 00:33:43,622
you left home and toiled yourself.

521
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,120
You're far away from your loved ones,

522
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,480
mired in pain.

523
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,200
Isn't that backward?

524
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,590
I'm just a nobody.

525
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,430
What else can I do

526
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,044
but give it my all?

527
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,200
If you wish to keep your family safe,

528
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,400
it doesn't have to be
through litchi delivery.

529
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,377
Why not let go of your worldly concerns

530
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,440
and cultivate Taoism with me?

531
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,840
Are you serious?

532
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:13,177
The Taoism I'm practicing

533
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,440
purges worldly attachments

534
00:34:14,644 --> 00:34:16,000
and grants one a new life.

535
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,888
If you cultivate for a few years,

536
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,400
you'll become one with nature,

537
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,870
pure inside and out.

538
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,200
Once you attain a higher realm,

539
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,550
you're free

540
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,800
from worldly burdens.

541
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,070
If I run away,

542
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,110
what about my family?

543
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,711
We accept lay disciples as well.

544
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,400
They may practice together.

545
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,480
Chang'an city

546
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:48,070
is grand and glorious.

547
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,510
However, the people within

548
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,888
are pitiful.

549
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,360
Those who vie for power

550
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,422
are unaware of their demise.

551
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:01,377
Those who indulge in debauchery

552
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,844
have no idea of the impending doom.

553
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,440
Those who crave fame

554
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,070
don't see the filth rising around them.

555
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,320
And those who cling to power

556
00:35:11,511 --> 00:35:13,711
fail to notice the collapse that awaits.

557
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,240
All sentient beings

558
00:35:16,266 --> 00:35:17,955
can't cut off their attachments

559
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,311
and break through the mist.

560
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,070
They simply muddle through.

561
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,070
Heed my advice.

562
00:35:24,177 --> 00:35:25,622
You're way too deep in this.

563
00:35:26,311 --> 00:35:28,044
A mere leaf
could easily block your vision.

564
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,920
Your actions may bring disaster,

565
00:35:30,866 --> 00:35:32,244
and you have yet to realize it.

566
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,430
What makes you say that?

567
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,511
In the 22nd year of Kaiyuan,

568
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,150
the Transport Commissioner
of Jianghuai and Henan,

569
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,070
Pei Yaoqing,

570
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,600
was dispatched to Hekou.

571
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,630
He developed a new transport system.

572
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,760
In three years,

573
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,320
seven million hu of rice grain
were delivered,

574
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,155
saving 300,000 guan in expenses.

575
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,760
For a time,

576
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,111
Chang'an enjoyed an abundance
of rice supply.

577
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,933
The Emperor no longer had
to rely on the Eastern Capital.

578
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,030
At that time, I was summoned

579
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,266
to assist with calculations.

580
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,280
I personally witnessed

581
00:36:21,244 --> 00:36:23,488
how the wise Mr. Pei
oversaw the entire operation.

582
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:24,870
I believe,

583
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,190
compared to

584
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,670
those vain scholars,

585
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,920
Mr. Pei was truly
a pillar of the nation.

586
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,630
Litchi delivery may be a trivial task

587
00:36:35,688 --> 00:36:36,720
compared to rice grain,

588
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,422
but why would following in the footsteps

589
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,600
of a wise man

590
00:36:41,444 --> 00:36:43,444
be a disaster?

591
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,577
Whether it's good or not,
the history will judge it.

592
00:36:49,177 --> 00:36:51,800
You're just someone with a bit
of talent in arithmetic.

593
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,030
This mission

594
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,777
allows you to use your talent
to the fullest,

595
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,630
that's why you don't see it

596
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,840
as a bad thing.

597
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,360
But you should know

598
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,177
this is your limit.

599
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,400
You should withdraw yourself

600
00:37:08,933 --> 00:37:10,422
and live a quiet life.

601
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,710
Keep yourself out of this chaos.

602
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,640
We common folk

603
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,288
only wish to live a good life.

604
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,088
Is that a sin? Is that wrong?

605
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,230
Chang'an is a deep pond.

606
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,590
The court is a whirlpool

607
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,440
inside this pond.

608
00:37:31,444 --> 00:37:32,670
People who are caught in it

609
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,444
lose all control over their lives.

610
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,840
Instead of climbing out,

611
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:38,422
you actually want to
make a name for yourself

612
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:39,511
in that whirlpool?

613
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,960
Judging by your words,

614
00:37:44,933 --> 00:37:46,222
you've been to Chang'an before?

615
00:37:50,377 --> 00:37:52,088
I was once caught up in the chaos

616
00:37:53,555 --> 00:37:55,844
and brought about
great causes and effects.

617
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,510
My heart was blind,

618
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,480
that's why I left to wander around

619
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,030
and cleanse my heart.

620
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,680
Well,

621
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,733
everyone has their own trials.

622
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,990
Still, I have to complete my mission.

623
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,511
Mister, you still haven't seen through

624
00:38:34,533 --> 00:38:35,488
the mist.

625
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,840
Fine.

626
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:42,960
You look similar

627
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,510
to an old friend

628
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,350
I met ten years ago.

629
00:38:46,288 --> 00:38:47,760
Let me offer you a piece of advice.

630
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,150
Laozi once said,

631
00:38:50,733 --> 00:38:52,280
"Good fortune follows upon disaster,

632
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,777
disaster lurks within good fortune."

633
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,800
What you're seeking

634
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,555
may not be a good end.

635
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,150
What you're avoiding

636
00:39:00,844 --> 00:39:02,511
may be the right path for your life.

637
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,070
Thank you, Sir.

638
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,377
May I know your name?

639
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,022
Just call me Changyuan.

640
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,111
What did the priest say to you?

641
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,960
You've seemed distracted

642
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,320
since you came down the mountain.

643
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,320
It felt like a dream.

644
00:39:33,444 --> 00:39:36,022
Noble Consort's birthday falls on
the first day of June.

645
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,840
That means

646
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,400
the delivery team must depart
from Lingnan

647
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,710
by the nineteenth day of May.

648
00:39:42,888 --> 00:39:45,466
This is a line between life and death
we can't afford to cross.

649
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,777
Time is running out. Let's hurry.

650
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:44,577
This is it, Chang'an.

651
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,760
I'm back home.

652
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,760
Come in.

653
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,920
What a magnificent city.

654
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,640
No wonder
there are legends about Chang'an

655
00:42:14,644 --> 00:42:15,355
everywhere.

656
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:16,550
Yeah.

657
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,390
Where are we going?

658
00:42:22,755 --> 00:42:24,088
To see my daughter.

659
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:29,020
=The Litchi Road=

660
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,199
Father!

661
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:32,000
Xiu'er.

662
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:36,719
I'm just a secretary.

663
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,280
Why are you making things hard

664
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,066
for an old man like me?

665
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:43,422
Rumor has it your colleague
at the Shanglin Office

666
00:42:43,444 --> 00:42:45,060
set you up for this mission on purpose.

667
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,350
I know a thing or two about this.

668
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,330
I never quite believed it.

669
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:49,222
Because I know setting
a trap like this isn't easy.

670
00:42:49,244 --> 00:42:50,190
It needs everyone

671
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,280
to pull their weight.

672
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:53,239
Don't tell me

673
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,760
you don't have any friends

674
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,444
in the Shanglin Office.

675
00:42:58,239 --> 00:42:59,159
There are just rumors.

676
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,079
Don't believe them.

677
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:00,760
No.

678
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,719
Send word to Yun Qing immediately

679
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:03,760
and tell her

680
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:05,280
the time has come.

681
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,866
She must plan it carefully

682
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,840
