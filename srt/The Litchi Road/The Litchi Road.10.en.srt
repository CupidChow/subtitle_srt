00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,900
(Maximize Gains, Minimize Losses)

3
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,710
(Inspector's Office)

4
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,630
Do your job.

5
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,870
Yes, sir.

6
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,030
Please try this.

7
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,630
Chief Scribe Zhao.

8
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,430
Please offer us any suggestions.

9
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,640
Put the rest on the tab as usual.

10
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,560
The tab...

11
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,590
Again?

12
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,400
Great-Uncle.

13
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,710
I bought a flowerpot

14
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,640
for Great-Aunt.

15
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,390
How many times have I told you?

16
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,670
Don't call me that in public.

17
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,040
Have a taste. Just delivered.

18
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,630
I'll pass.

19
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,830
I noticed the chickens' shade canopy

20
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,320
still hasn't been set up
during my inspection

21
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,600
this morning.

22
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,110
Why is it not done yet?

23
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,710
What are these workers even doing?

24
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,440
Inspector He

25
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,230
has been struggling with insomnia.

26
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,120
Combined with this hot weather,

27
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,910
his temper is short.

28
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,640
He has not received guests in ten days.

29
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,880
Right now, only those chickens

30
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,080
can bring a smile to his face.

31
00:02:49,888 --> 00:02:51,040
If the chickens are happy...

32
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,590
Then he is happy.

33
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,640
And if he's happy...

34
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,150
Then we are happy.

35
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,600
Otherwise, no one gets to be happy.

36
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,040
Understood.

37
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,360
The canopy should have been

38
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,510
finished yesterday.

39
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,390
But we had
an unexpected rat infestation.

40
00:03:07,444 --> 00:03:08,560
The servants have been busy

41
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,110
eradicating the pests.

42
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,510
Rats?

43
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,320
How did that happen?

44
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,510
Funds for pest control

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,355
were already allocated, were they not?

46
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,230
Well...

47
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,640
Didn't you make some budget adjustments

48
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,600
for "efficiency"?

49
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,000
I withheld funds?

50
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,120
Even if I did

51
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,440
trim a bit off the top,

52
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,520
I still allocated half

53
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,710
to the procurement staff.

54
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,390
You withheld some too?

55
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,270
Unbelievable!

56
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:52,670
That fund was already tight

57
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,030
to begin with!

58
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,950
How much

59
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,230
did you take?

60
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,790
Just...

61
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,640
Just half.

62
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,550
Unbelievable.

63
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,560
You're treating flies like meat.

64
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,200
Not worried you'll get a stomachache?

65
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,040
I did the calculations.

66
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,377
Even with what's left,

67
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:13,280
it should have been enough
if they were careful.

68
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,470
But who would have thought
the buyer had the guts

69
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,830
to pocket some, too...

70
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,560
Greed clouds judgment.

71
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,240
You botched such a small matter.

72
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,080
Have you sealed everyone's lips?

73
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,040
Worry not.

74
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,555
The servants wouldn't dare speak out.

75
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,420
I already purchased rat poison

76
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,310
(A Slave From Linyi)
and had it mixed with rice

77
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:34,560
to bait the big ones.

78
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,830
Any rat that eats it

79
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,560
will be dead within minutes.

80
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,680
You haven't even finished
the visible tasks,

81
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,733
and you are already scrambling
to plug the holes.

82
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,680
Don't you know
which priorities matter most?

83
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,320
Listen to me.

84
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,070
Whatever Inspector He can see

85
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,590
is the number one priority.

86
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,720
Once he wakes up, he will see...

87
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,030
That the rats are gone.

88
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,270
The chickens! Not the rats!

89
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,750
Get to work!

90
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,760
Stay sharp!

91
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,320
Each day's success begins
in the morning.

92
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,155
You slave, why are you
standing around in a daze?

93
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,670
Get to work!

94
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,510
Poison the rats.

95
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,870
Poison? What poison?

96
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,030
Do you not know what matters more?

97
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,360
Only what Inspector He sees

98
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,888
is what matters most.

99
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,750
Move!

100
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,120
Hurry!

101
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,140
=Episode 10=

102
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,350
- Brother.
- Today, I learned

103
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,680
that you are

104
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,470
the younger brother I lost years ago.

105
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,600
You are my brother.

106
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,520
Slow down.

107
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,600
Brother.

108
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,070
- Brother.
- Brother!

109
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,600
You return

110
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,720
in high spirits!

111
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,822
We must get together again

112
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:01,955
another time.

113
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,590
Tonight wasn't satisfying enough.

114
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,040
Next time.

115
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:06,555
We'll drink to our heart's content.

116
00:06:06,555 --> 00:06:08,155
The days ahead be long and prosperous!

117
00:06:08,177 --> 00:06:08,870
Yes! Prosperous!

118
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,270
Long and prosperous days!

119
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,190
Brother.

120
00:06:11,822 --> 00:06:12,920
Don't leave me, my brother!

121
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,360
Brother.

122
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,760
We'll meet again another day.

123
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,510
Brother.

124
00:06:19,155 --> 00:06:20,200
We'll get together again.

125
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,470
Another time.

126
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,710
Safe return!

127
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,150
Brother!

128
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,880
Brother!

129
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,880
Until next time!

130
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,310
Young Master.

131
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,390
Excuse me.

132
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,310
Do you need a ride?

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,870
Qilang,

134
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,950
you had me terribly worried.

135
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,480
They mixed ice jade liquor

136
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,640
with litchi brew.

137
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,470
They were trying to get you drunk.

138
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,680
I knew from the first sip.

139
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,240
Tonight's banquet

140
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,240
was a trap.

141
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,190
They are unaware

142
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:09,688
that I am Chang'an's
Assistant Minister of Entertainment.

143
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:12,990
If they want to scheme through wine,

144
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,760
I can take them on by myself.

145
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,240
I fear no liquor.

146
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,720
The drinks were merely

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,955
enough for me
to rinse my mouth.

148
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,800
However,

149
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:29,911
they will be vomiting their guts out.

150
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,380
(Inspector's Office)

151
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,080
The storm is strong today!

152
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,640
Men, hold tight!

153
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,390
- Hold tight!
- Hold tight!

154
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,170
Over here! To the side!

155
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,910
Such a heavy rain!

156
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,150
I cannot see a thing!

157
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,350
Watch for hidden reefs! Stay on course!

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Raise the sail!

159
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,680
Forward!

160
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,560
Ma Guiyun stayed behind

161
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,470
for one reason.

162
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,830
To oversee the use
of the military tally.

163
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,200
Charge!

164
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,120
Charge!

165
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,470
Let the wind

166
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,840
and the rain

167
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,240
come!

168
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,640
Row harder!

169
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,910
- Row faster!
- One, two! One, two!

170
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,920
One, two!

171
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,350
That old fox is just worried

172
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,590
I'll seize all of his wealth!

173
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,030
I'll stab him!

174
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,150
Stab!

175
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,750
80.

176
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,560
2,580.

177
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,040
I brought you some food.

178
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,120
You're learning

179
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,350
to be considerate.

180
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,470
Fermented wine?

181
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,990
That's the scent on me.

182
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,550
Xiu'er sent this.

183
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,470
Xiu'er?

184
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,040
Look. She embroidered this hubing.

185
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,720
Her stitching has improved.

186
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,470
Look at the crumbs
she stitched beside it.

187
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,240
She only sent one?

188
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,577
Does she not know
her uncle likes this sort of thing too?

189
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,750
It's not her fault.

190
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,560
She doesn't know you're in Lingnan.

191
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,990
Tell her, then.

192
00:09:29,222 --> 00:09:30,400
We can talk about that later.

193
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,310
You've been scribbling
calculations for days.

194
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:36,822
Still haven't sorted
out the calculations?

195
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,870
I want to try

196
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,320
a litchi transport trial run.

197
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,150
I need to calculate all the issues

198
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,630
that might come up en route.

199
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,630
This is just theory on paper.

200
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,022
How are you going
to identify the real problems?

201
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,830
I do not know political games.

202
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,230
I am not skilled in rhetoric.

203
00:09:54,244 --> 00:09:56,466
I passed the exams
in the mathematics division.

204
00:09:56,577 --> 00:09:57,680
Since entering government,

205
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,600
all I have dealt with are ledgers,

206
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,520
warehouse logs,
tax records, and reports.

207
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,470
The only thing I am good at

208
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,070
is calculating.

209
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,590
And the only thing
I can rely on is calculating.

210
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,240
Stop calculating for now.

211
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,160
Eat something first.

212
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:14,710
I don't have an appetite.

213
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,080
I wouldn't have known

214
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,040
without doing the calculations.

215
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,320
What Su gave us

216
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,670
is nowhere near enough.

217
00:10:25,822 --> 00:10:27,110
You've already put it that way.

218
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,440
I have to help you now.

219
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,400
Tell me.

220
00:10:31,688 --> 00:10:32,950
How much do you still need?

221
00:10:35,355 --> 00:10:36,550
I have already cut the costs

222
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,520
to the absolute minimum.

223
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
We're still short by 2,580 guan.

224
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,200
That was careless of me.

225
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,280
Shande.

226
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,160
Let's call it a night.

227
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,830
2,580 guan.

228
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,550
Chief!

229
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,390
Beardy! Beardy! Beardy!

230
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,310
Chief!

231
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,800
- He's here?
- Yes.

232
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,080
He is here!

233
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,000
Mr. Li.

234
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,240
Su.

235
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,750
You wanted to see me in a hurry.

236
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,080
What are your intentions?

237
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,000
Last time, didn't you say

238
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,080
that you had a keen interest
in Lingnan cuisine,

239
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,910
and wanted to sample

240
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,590
all of Lingnan's delicacies with me?

241
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,270
Today,

242
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,790
I have brought you a rare fruit.

243
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,710
Do try it.

244
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,400
Just what I hoped for.

245
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,670
Follow me.

246
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,590
Let's go.

247
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,640
Come on.

248
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,830
Here.

249
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,240
Try this big one.

250
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,670
Try it.

251
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,550
Go on.

252
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,110
Only pregnant women

253
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,240
like things

254
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,230
this sour!

255
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,510
Is Noble Consort

256
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,520
expecting?

257
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,800
This is March Red.
It's used for winemaking.

258
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,630
Dong people don't eat that.

259
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,470
Forget the sourness.

260
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,880
Is it fresh?

261
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,720
Fresh.

262
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,560
Unprecedentedly fresh.

263
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,990
Truth is, this litchi

264
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,110
has already been stored for four days.

265
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,400
If I get food poisoning

266
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:06,288
and start vomiting and having diarrhea,

267
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,920
be warned, I will storm your residence

268
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,670
and raise chaos!

269
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,350
You will not get sick.

270
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,280
Su, I used the double-layer urn

271
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,040
you gave me,

272
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,840
and followed Tong's

273
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,760
water bath method.

274
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,200
First, I washed the March Red

275
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,440
in saltwater,

276
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,350
and then sealed it inside the urn.

277
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,440
I then filled the outer layer
with cold water.

278
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,230
Changed the water every half day,

279
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,630
so the temperature

280
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,670
stayed low

281
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,990
and humid inside.

282
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
That way,

283
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,590
even after four to six days,

284
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,390
the litchi tastes like

285
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,830
it was just picked.

286
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,750
Who would have thought

287
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,990
my double-layer urn is so incredible!

288
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,470
I am overjoyed

289
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,230
right now.

290
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,630
All right.

291
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,720
Stop gawking.

292
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,640
Back to work.

293
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,990
Go play.

294
00:13:57,933 --> 00:13:59,000
Where's the boiled litchis?

295
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,630
Give me two.

296
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,680
Let's go.

297
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,550
Now,

298
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,920
tell me your true scheme.

299
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,760
I want

300
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,840
to run

301
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,920
a litchi transport trial.

302
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,240
Tong will provide me

303
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,590
with 50 kg of March Red.

304
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,470
I want you to help me

305
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,240
buy some horses,

306
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,280
hire riders,

307
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,400
and purchase a few straw-patched boats.

308
00:14:30,555 --> 00:14:31,777
We'll split into four groups.

309
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,630
Each group will carry

310
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,160
double-layer urns full of litchi.

311
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,280
All four depart simultaneously.

312
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,520
No concern for cost.

313
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,230
I want to see just
how far litchis can go

314
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,360
before it spoils.

315
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,280
How many horses and riders

316
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,640
do you need?

317
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,920
Over a hundred horses,

318
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,350
probably several dozen riders.

319
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,880
Su.

320
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,990
These are the four routes I mapped out.

321
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,710
Take a look.

322
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,280
The first route

323
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,680
goes via Mei Pass,

324
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,270
through Qianzhou, Ezhou, and Suizhou.

325
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,870
Same route I took

326
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,790
when I came to Lingnan.

327
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,950
The second route is via

328
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,590
the West Capital Circuit.

329
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,390
This ancient path dates back

330
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,710
to the Eastern Han.

331
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,270
It runs from Ruyuan through Chenzhou,

332
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,630
Hengzhou, Tanzhou,
and then to Jiangling.

333
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,240
This is the shortest

334
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,230
straight-line route.

335
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,520
This is the third route.

336
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,870
This route also starts at Mei Pass,

337
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,550
but crosses the river

338
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,590
and goes straight north to Suzhou,

339
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,270
then connects

340
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,830
with Tang's Jianghuai canal route,

341
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,670
along the Bian River,
Yellow River, and Luo River

342
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,590
to the capital.

343
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:45,777
Then, we have the fourth route.

344
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,590
This route goes directly by boat,

345
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,870
entering the Pearl River,
through Qin River, Zhen River,

346
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,670
crossing Mei Pass again,
into the Gan River,

347
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,630
upstream to the Yangtze,

348
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,630
into the Han River, Xiangzhou,

349
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,800
then rerouted
along the Shangzhou Circuit.

350
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,830
Each of these four routes

351
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,950
has its advantages.

352
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,990
I don't expect them all to succeed.

353
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:04,030
I just want to find out

354
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,920
how far our transportation can go.

355
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,640
In Lingnan,

356
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,080
a good northern horse costs 13 guan.

357
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,990
A capable rider,

358
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,750
at least five guan.

359
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,920
For such long distances,

360
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:25,350
even if you spare no effort

361
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,080
with the horses,

362
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,230
you will still need

363
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,520
to pay extra to the riders.

364
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,960
Otherwise, no one will agree

365
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,320
to do it.

366
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,950
On top of that,
there's food and supplies

367
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,920
for both humans and horses,

368
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,710
bribes for the checkpoints,

369
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,710
and equipment for land
and water transportation.

370
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,400
All together,

371
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,120
it adds up

372
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,520
to an astronomical figure.

373
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,040
I know.

374
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,950
I have calculated all of it.

375
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,190
Su.

376
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,800
You have been operating
in Lingnan for years.

377
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,680
You know the real cost, loss rate,

378
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,310
and price ranges far better

379
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,670
than I do.

380
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,320
That is why I want you

381
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,910
to negotiate for me.

382
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,080
All right.

383
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,240
How much money do you currently have?

384
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,960
996 guan.

385
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,190
996 guan?

386
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,110
That number

387
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,960
sounds familiar.

388
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,390
That's the amount you paid me
for the travel pass.

389
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,000
Do you plan to put all that money

390
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,240
into this expedition?

391
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,480
Not even keeping a little

392
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,430
for yourself?

393
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,590
I had planned

394
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,430
to return to Chang'an with it,

395
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,910
pay off my mortgage,

396
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,760
and leave some for my daughter.

397
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,000
But if I don't attempt

398
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,000
this litchi mission,

399
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:57,288
I am a dead man either way.

400
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,630
For my daughter's sake,

401
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,190
I want to go all in and give it a try.

402
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,830
Just those numbers you listed

403
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,800
add up to at least 3,000 guan.

404
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,790
Try some freshly cooked litchis.

405
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,350
All right.

406
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,755
Good for cooling down in the heat.

407
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,240
I have 996 guan.

408
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,000
I still need 2,580 guan.

409
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,350
But that's my estimate.

410
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,720
If you negotiate the deals,

411
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,590
2,500 guan should do it.

412
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,080
Here's my offer, Su.

413
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,910
I'll make another trip
to the Inspector's Office

414
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,560
and get you three

415
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,640
blank travel passes.

416
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,920
Could you

417
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,000
lend me 2,500 guan?

418
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,430
So, that's your real scheme.

419
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,960
You want money from me.

420
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,430
Miss Tong.

421
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,190
Tell me your scheme.

422
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,190
Li Shande is different
from other city folks.

423
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,777
Everyone else
who comes to the litchi garden

424
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,110
wants something from us.

425
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,510
They look at us

426
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,870
like we're servants.

427
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,400
But he's not like that.

428
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,510
He is the first official

429
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,040
who actually worked in the garden.

430
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:13,680
He even helped us drive out the thugs

431
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,870
who tried to take it over.

432
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,830
Never mind 50 kg of litchi.

433
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,440
Even if he asked for 150,

434
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,733
I would pick them all for him.

435
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,950
Mr. Li.

436
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,110
I thought your talk

437
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,870
of transporting litchi to Chang'an

438
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,590
was some childish fantasy.

439
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,920
But now,

440
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,280
I see you truly mean to make it happen.

441
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,560
Since you've grown

442
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,190
a plan and ambition in your heart,

443
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,670
I'll gladly trade

444
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,040
my treasure for yours

445
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,200
once more.

446
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,720
Really?

447
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,640
Of course.

448
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,120
Thank you.

449
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,720
But I'll need extra payment

450
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,560
this time.

451
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,800
I need four travel passes.

452
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,080
What do you say?

453
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,160
Deal.

454
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,870
Four it is.

455
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,860
(Litchi Bureau)

456
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,480
Are the pastries to your liking?

457
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,480
Much better since my previous visit.

458
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,190
Thank you. Enjoy your meal.

459
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,640
Sir.

460
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:28,070
Mr. Li, you're all dressed up.

461
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,000
Where are you headed?

462
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,800
I'm going to the Inspector's Office.

463
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:46,140
(Litchi Bureau)

464
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,340
(Inspector's Office)

465
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,510
(Litchi Bureau)

466
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,430
Mr. Li.

467
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,550
I need to see Inspector He.

468
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,270
Please notify him.

469
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,190
Inspector He is out.

470
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:02,920
What about Chief Scribe Zhao?

471
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,150
He went out with him.

472
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,800
When will they be back?

473
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,560
No idea.

474
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,960
The tea is brewing in the pot.

475
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,830
Guests don't ask about customs.

476
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,280
Put in a coin and help yourself.

477
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,070
If you need

478
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,040
any refreshments,

479
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,670
just let me know.

480
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,000
Don't worry about the refreshments.

481
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,670
Do you charge for plain water?

482
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,160
You jest, sir.

483
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,830
Who would charge

484
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,630
for plain water?

485
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:45,644
Give me a bowl of plain water, then.

486
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,750
All right.

487
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,840
Sir.

488
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,960
You should choose something.

489
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,000
How about some Purple Bamboo Shoot Tea?

490
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,470
It's authentic.

491
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:03,870
Purple bamboo shoots
are a product of Huainan Circuit.

492
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,760
How can Lingnan have any good ones?

493
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,600
And at this price,

494
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,955
it's unlikely to be quality either.

495
00:22:07,955 --> 00:22:09,630
Then, how about this?

496
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,720
Our local Xishan tea.

497
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,480
This much for local tea?

498
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,720
The shopkeeper has spoken.

499
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,080
Our seats are only reserved

500
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,720
for paying customers.

501
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,240
Please move.

502
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,160
But...

503
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,030
If this place gets full,

504
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,920
I'll leave.

505
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,030
But right now, it's empty.

506
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,030
My official uniform alone

507
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,955
should raise
your establishment's prestige.

508
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,720
Tell your shopkeeper

509
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
running a business
takes clever calculations.

510
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,270
You're waiting for people

511
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,711
from the Inspector's Office, yes?

512
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,440
Come with me.

513
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,470
I've got an excellent seat for you.
Come here.

514
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:01,270
(Inspector's Office)
Look.

515
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:02,844
This is the spot with the best view.

516
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,830
You're exiling me to the corner?

517
00:23:05,533 --> 00:23:06,600
A good arrangement is one

518
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,720
that works for both you

519
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,910
and me.

520
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:26,220
(Litchi Bureau)

521
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:36,700
(Inspector's Office)

522
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,440
Inspector He,

523
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,360
do take care.

524
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,270
You will see it

525
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,350
in a moment.

526
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,910
The chicken shelter is already set up.

527
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,350
Amita even sent someone

528
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,200
to deliver

529
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,630
fish bone meal specially

530
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,110
for the chickens' nourishment.

531
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,480
Amita is thoughtful.

532
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,320
Indeed.

533
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,666
Even with so many affairs
at the Merchants' Association,

534
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:10,830
she still remembers to care
about your fighting roosters.

535
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,000
Such filial affection.

536
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,830
Of course she is filial.

537
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,590
You have treated her as your own

538
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,911
and nurtured her with affection,

539
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:20,480
just as her father

540
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,910
by blood would.

541
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,960
Same kindness and love,

542
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,110
but not the same long-lasting fortune.

543
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
Inspector He.

544
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,190
You will surely live a long life,

545
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,977
as enduring as the southern mountains.

546
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,560
Lately,

547
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,350
I get annoyed just seeing people.

548
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,480
This envoy, that envoy.

549
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,960
They are all swarming around me.

550
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,133
They're such a nuisance.

551
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,000
But the moment I see these chickens,

552
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,910
I feel happy again.

553
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,510
Bring them out.

554
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,750
Careful!

555
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,670
Careful.

556
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,880
Be gentle.

557
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,080
Yes. Handle them with care.

558
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,430
Excellent.

559
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,560
Wonderful!

560
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,200
Look at that spirit

561
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,320
and bearing.

562
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,320
Extraordinary.

563
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,750
Once they're well-fed,

564
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,866
they'll be ready to fight for me
on the battlefield.

565
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,270
So vigorous!

566
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,310
Bring me that thing.

567
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,560
Right away.

568
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,470
Here we go.

569
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,400
Here you go.

570
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,320
Come.

571
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,920
That's my...

572
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,066
Behave yourself, you slave!

573
00:25:40,088 --> 00:25:41,830
How dare you offend Inspector He!

574
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,680
What did he say?

575
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,910
All nonsense. Pay him no mind.

576
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,480
This is a bowl

577
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,750
used by the servants.

578
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,910
It's hardly good enough
for your precious roosters.

579
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,910
They deserve much better bowls.

580
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,190
Surely.

581
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,270
(I already purchased rat poison)

582
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,577
(and had it mixed with rice.)

583
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,750
(Any rat that eats it)

584
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,430
(will be dead within minutes.)

585
00:26:04,244 --> 00:26:06,800
Inspector's Office must learn
to increase revenue and cut costs.

586
00:26:06,911 --> 00:26:08,480
Or no matter how large the office is,

587
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,511
it will all be squandered.

588
00:26:09,555 --> 00:26:10,400
Yes, Sir.

589
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,200
These bowls are for cutting costs.

590
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,390
When was this rice prepared?

591
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,977
Don't feed the chickens spoiled food.

592
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,510
It has been out for half a day already.

593
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,430
It's no longer fresh.

594
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,830
It was left outside...

595
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,110
What do you mean?

596
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,190
By your logic,

597
00:26:23,222 --> 00:26:24,160
we need to grow new rice

598
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,333
every time we feed chickens?

599
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,760
In storage or not,

600
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,720
rice is rice.

601
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,750
Right?

602
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,640
Out in the open, it can dry in the sun.

603
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,590
The storage is damp.

604
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,000
Leaving it out is better, right?

605
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,266
Perfect for feeding chickens.

606
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,590
Look at those roosters.

607
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,270
Inspector He.

608
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,760
I just remembered
urgent official documents

609
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,110
are awaiting your signature.

610
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,830
The shelter has been set up.

611
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:50,400
Feeding the chickens is a trivial task

612
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,622
best left to the servants.

613
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,920
Allow me, Sir.

614
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,320
Allow you what?

615
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,160
I was finally in a good mood

616
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,600
and wanted to feed the chickens.

617
00:26:59,644 --> 00:27:00,750
Wanted to relax a little

618
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,670
and enjoy myself.

619
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,110
Why are you all trying

620
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,080
to stop me?

621
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,150
Why can't you just let me be happy?

622
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,440
Do you want me

623
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,440
to give you

624
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,510
50 lashes too?

625
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,480
We wouldn't dare.

626
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,080
I'm feeding the chickens!

627
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,880
Is that clear?

628
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,230
Eat!

629
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,190
Eat!

630
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,280
(Eat and live a long life!)

631
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,800
(Eat my rice and live a long life!)

632
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,110
(Eat my rice and be healthy!)

633
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,520
(Eat and gain fortune and longevity!)

634
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:36,000
(Eat up! Eat to your hearts' content!)

635
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:44,000
(Fang's Coconuts, Lingnan)

636
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,580
(Inspector's Office)

637
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,000
Has Inspector He returned?

638
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,470
Mr. Li.

639
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,030
Stop waiting.

640
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,560
Inspector He won't be returning today.

641
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,960
What about Chief Scribe Zhao?

642
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,560
He won't return either.

643
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,150
How dare you poison them!

644
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,080
You killed all of them!

645
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,150
Isn't that Chief Scribe Zhao?

646
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,790
Well...

647
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,910
Isn't that Chief Scribe Zhao?

648
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,520
I am the Litchi Envoy
appointed by His Majesty!

649
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,800
How dare you lie to me

650
00:28:27,888 --> 00:28:29,200
and obstruct official business!

651
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,120
I demand to see him!

652
00:28:30,622 --> 00:28:32,333
- Mr. Li!
- Don't try to stop me!

653
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,150
All of them are dead!

654
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,640
You prepared

655
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,911
- the bowl
- Poison the rats!

656
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,150
and the poison.

657
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,720
You left the rice there.

658
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,000
No one else handled any of it.

659
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,320
You deliberately poisoned them.

660
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,870
And now you have implicated everyone.

661
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,280
You animal!

662
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,960
You worthless slave!

663
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,560
Chief Scribe Zhao.

664
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,710
Mr. Li?

665
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,430
You.

666
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,670
Why did you barge

667
00:29:16,377 --> 00:29:18,400
into the Inspector's Office uninvited?

668
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,320
I came this time

669
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,480
to ask Chief Scribe Zhao

670
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,910
for four more travel passes,

671
00:29:24,955 --> 00:29:26,888
to handle official business
for His Majesty.

672
00:29:26,888 --> 00:29:28,444
What happened to the one you had?

673
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,750
Did you lose it?

674
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,230
No.

675
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,670
You know this task

676
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,280
is extremely difficult.

677
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,910
I can't do it alone.

678
00:29:38,066 --> 00:29:39,390
Having a few extra travel passes

679
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,350
will make things easier.

680
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,320
So,

681
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,040
you've made progress

682
00:29:54,844 --> 00:29:56,240
in the matter of the fresh litchis?

683
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,270
I found a grower

684
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,190
named Tong.

685
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,400
She says her litchis
are exclusively supplied

686
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,350
to the Inspector's Office.

687
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,280
I've heard Dong women
are quite sentimental.

688
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,870
Could it be that you...

689
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,160
I am working for His Majesty.

690
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,688
I can't afford personal distractions.

691
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,777
That makes things easy, then.

692
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,088
I'll make the decision
on behalf of Inspector He.

693
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,240
This season's harvest
from Tong's plantations

694
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,630
will be fully assigned to you.

695
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,030
Wait.

696
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:36,880
Even if I have fresh produce,

697
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,430
I need the means to transport them.

698
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,030
Please do grant some leeway.

699
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,350
Otherwise, the project won't work.

700
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,910
I would fail His Majesty's trust.

701
00:30:44,377 --> 00:30:47,022
If that's the case,
why would you still need travel passes?

702
00:30:47,066 --> 00:30:48,400
I have a few incompetent soldiers

703
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,590
at the office.

704
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,150
I'll assign them to you
for your use too.

705
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,710
Well, my back...

706
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,430
Chief Scribe Zhao.

707
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,000
I need both people and travel passes.

708
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,000
I need both.

709
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,640
You know

710
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,040
how impossible this task is.

711
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,680
No need to threaten me with a whip.

712
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,030
I die in Chang'an

713
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,080
or I die here.

714
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,590
Let me live freely

715
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,760
for the last few months,

716
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,880
or

717
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,800
kill me now. Go ahead.

718
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,640
Mr. Li...

719
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,160
Kill me. Do it.

720
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,640
What you...

721
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,640
I am the Litchi Envoy.

722
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,200
Even if I die, you're all splattered.

723
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,120
Do it.

724
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,920
Why go to such extremes?

725
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,330
Then why are you pushing me like this?

726
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:39,640
If you won't give me the passes,

727
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,400
then have Inspector He come out

728
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,590
and give me a straight answer.

729
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,790
Inspector He. Inspector He!

730
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,720
I know you are in there.

731
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,390
Come out! Face me!

732
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,590
His Majesty specifically wanted

733
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,310
litchis from Lingnan.

734
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,400
Fresh litchis from Lingnan!

735
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,830
You're the inspector of Lingnan!

736
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,150
Don't play deaf!

737
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,390
Come out and face me!

738
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,480
Otherwise, there will be questions

739
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,670
in Chang'an!

740
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,240
Just kill me already.

741
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,070
- I have no will to live.
- Mr. Li, please...

742
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,000
I can't go on.

743
00:32:06,111 --> 00:32:07,790
Death is waiting for me
no matter where I go.

744
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,480
You want to die...

745
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,160
Just kill me.

746
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,280
There's no need to go this far.

747
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,720
I...

748
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,560
I'll be right back.

749
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,270
There must be someone

750
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,190
behind this!

751
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,760
Investigate!

752
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,720
Chicken Daddy!

753
00:32:33,888 --> 00:32:35,160
Chicken Daddy! Chicken Daddy!

754
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,950
Has he confessed?

755
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,670
Where did he get the poison?

756
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,630
That mutt can barely speak clearly.

757
00:32:42,911 --> 00:32:44,270
Now that he has caused a disaster,

758
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,729
he is stunned and speechless,
like a rooster caught off guard.

759
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,288
You still dare to bring up the chickens?

760
00:32:48,355 --> 00:32:49,280
No...

761
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,600
Chicken Daddy.

762
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,670
That Litchi Envoy came again.

763
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,560
He wants four more travel passes.

764
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,350
That shameless leech.

765
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,960
Is he still not satisfied?

766
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,270
Don't give him any.

767
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,550
Truth is,

768
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,750
that Litchi Envoy will be done

769
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,150
by the first day of June.

770
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,480
He is from Chang'an.

771
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,350
We do not know

772
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,790
who might be

773
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,040
behind him.

774
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,830
If we mishandle things

775
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,030
and someone seizes on it,

776
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,870
they could make a huge fuss in court.

777
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,510
We're stuck down here in Lingnan.

778
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,670
We'd be too far away
to defend ourselves.

779
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,670
Zhao.

780
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,720
I'm going mad from all this.

781
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,480
Ma Guiyun

782
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,350
and that Litchi Envoy...

783
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,910
They just won't give me a break!

784
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,350
In my opinion...

785
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,760
In my humble opinion,

786
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,670
maybe this time we go along with him

787
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,800
for now.

788
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,320
Speak up.

789
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,480
Let him make a bit of money.

790
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,760
Once we pass
the first day of June,

791
00:34:06,888 --> 00:34:09,666
and a decree from Chang'an arrives
to hold someone accountable,

792
00:34:09,666 --> 00:34:11,311
we can just tie him up
and send him back.

793
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,110
Use the court's authority

794
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,360
to settle the score
for those few passes.

795
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,270
Whatever the merchants gained,

796
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,310
we'll make them give it back tenfold.

797
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,030
Is that not better?

798
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,680
Fine.

799
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,150
I've had enough of this matter, Zhao.

800
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
You handle it.

801
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,040
All I care about is my chickens.

802
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,280
Take care of it.

803
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,630
Yes, sir.

804
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:39,020
(Inspector's Office)

805
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,310
How's this, Mr. Li?

806
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,470
Chief Scribe Zhao.

807
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,550
Mr. Li.

808
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,520
The four travel passes you wanted.

809
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,920
Thank you.

810
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,840
Beat him up!

811
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,920
Yes.

812
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,880
Get down.

813
00:35:13,422 --> 00:35:14,630
I'll teach you a lesson!

814
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,230
Even a bug fights to stay alive.

815
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,310
Killing someone is still bad news.

816
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,670
If he dies,

817
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,000
we'll just buy another slave.

818
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,920
But having a death
in the office is unlucky.

819
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:28,880
That will teach you a lesson!

820
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,030
Give me the key.

821
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,400
Yes, sir.

822
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,030
I take my leave.

823
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,510
Wait.

824
00:35:38,866 --> 00:35:40,560
You said you wanted
both people and passes.

825
00:35:41,555 --> 00:35:44,066
I don't have other men for you,
but you can have him.

826
00:35:45,866 --> 00:35:47,111
Keep a close eye on him.

827
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,150
He is mute.

828
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,310
You are in Lingnan now.

829
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,110
At least

830
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,190
keep someone around to serve

831
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,590
and run errands.

832
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,680
He poisoned

833
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,150
Inspector He's fighting roosters.

834
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,470
He won't survive

835
00:36:10,044 --> 00:36:11,480
when Inspector He gets back anyway.

836
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,880
I'll take him.

837
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,750
Can you understand me?

838
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,710
Do you have a name?

839
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,280
You don't.

840
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,710
Then, I will give you one.

841
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,400
I'll give you a name.

842
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,710
That will make it easier
to address you.

843
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,560
I transport litchis.

844
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,230
So, I'll name you Li.

845
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,760
Li.

846
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,720
Li.

847
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,840
Li.

848
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,230
Don't be afraid.

849
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,080
I won't hit you.

850
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,550
I won't.

851
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,030
Let's go.

852
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,900
(Litchi Bureau)

853
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,000
I left the stool there.

854
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,110
All right.

855
00:37:39,555 --> 00:37:40,680
How much is it per bowl?

856
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,920
Two coins per bowl.

857
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,030
Two coins...

858
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,230
My wontons are famous

859
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,550
far and wide.

860
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,550
I don't skimp on the ingredients.

861
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:55,670
Made fresh on the spot,
thin-skinned and full of filling.

862
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,760
You're guaranteed

863
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,590
to taste a mouthful of meat in each.

864
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,360
Make it half a mouthful.

865
00:38:00,644 --> 00:38:02,150
One coin per bowl. Give me two bowls.

866
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,710
But...

867
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,960
How am I supposed to make that?

868
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,080
Did you not just say "freshly made,
famous far and wide"?

869
00:38:08,088 --> 00:38:08,960
Was that all talk?

870
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,200
I...

871
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,040
Sit.

872
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,750
Sit here, Li.

873
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,590
We can't work

874
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,750
on empty stomachs.

875
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,880
Sit down.

876
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,230
Just sit down.

877
00:38:41,768 --> 00:38:42,680
Wait here.

878
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,620
(Wonton)

879
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,670
Wait there.

880
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,320
Sit.

881
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,320
Do as you like.

882
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,110
Still there.

883
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,040
He's obedient, at least.

884
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,960
Put this on.

885
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,320
We'll be working

886
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,790
on transporting litchis.

887
00:39:23,844 --> 00:39:25,711
You need to be dressed
more appropriately.

888
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,630
Is my order not ready yet?

889
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,555
He already finished everything.

890
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:44,590
It's all right.
If he can eat well, he can work well.

891
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,080
Give me a bowl of soup.

892
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,320
Watch your step.

893
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,110
Watch your step.

894
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:14,300
(Litchi Bureau)

895
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,790
Four travel passes

896
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,310
for your perusal.

897
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,040
They're genuine.

898
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,110
You kept your word.

899
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,880
I have no complaints.

900
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,920
You're an outstanding man indeed.

901
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,710
I'm at a loss for words.

902
00:40:33,955 --> 00:40:35,088
I'm thoroughly convinced.

903
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,400
That's good.

904
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,110
This will allow four merchant caravans
to travel free of charge.

905
00:40:43,422 --> 00:40:44,760
These travel passes are worth

906
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,040
their weight in gold.

907
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,230
You made good on your promise.

908
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:52,750
I'll hold up my end of the bargain.

909
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,190
Not a single coin short.

910
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,190
Not a single horse missing.

911
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:59,270
Every rider accounted for.

912
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,840
I will see this to the end

913
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,200
with you.

914
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,750
Thank you, Su.

915
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,560
With your support,

916
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,710
I can finally rest easy.

00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,320
What...

You...

927
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,840
Not you!

928
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,190
Get back here!

Is this a betrothal gift?

931
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,590
No.

932
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,960
You promised me

933
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,880
50 kg of March Red.

934
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,790
This is an advance payment.

935
00:41:59,177 --> 00:42:00,822
So it was just business after all.

936
00:42:00,933 --> 00:42:02,822
I drank that unity wine
with you for nothing.

937
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,190
I did not understand

938
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,710
the customs of the Dong people.

939
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,150
My apologies.

940
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,110
Tong, you are beautiful

941
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:10,840
and intelligent.

942
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,977
You deserve a worthy match.

943

Even though you apologized,

944
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:17,630
I don't plan on forgiving you.

I'll trouble you to help me negotiate

the travel expenses.

949
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:28,920

on preparing for the trials.

Matters between men and women?

00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,750
in Lingnan,
and it is making things complicated?

I've always been fond
of riding in Chang'an.

964

965
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,480
the Sassy Rider.

966
00:43:02,133 --> 00:43:03,150

You're Ma Guiyun.

968
00:43:04,133 --> 00:43:05,288
You deal with the horses.

969
00:43:05,288 --> 00:43:07,288

for the rest of the horses.
