=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,960
(A Radish Peeling Knife - Two)

3
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,760
Left Chancellor found out after all.

4
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,670
Stop following me.

5
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,040
Why are you still standing there?

6
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,630
Aren't you afraid that I'll kill you?

7
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,000
No.

8
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,630
Because you kill bad people.

9
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,910
Traitors shall not be spared.

10
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,950
You saved me.

11
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,230
Take this.

12
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,880
Find a good home for yourself.

13
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,560
I don't want it.

14
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,760
What do you want then?

15
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,560
I want revenge.

16
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,630
Who is your enemy?

17
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,440
All traitors.

18
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,240
What is your name?

19
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,440
Dongxue.

20
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,070
Your real name.

21
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,630
Yun Qing.

22
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,720
=Episode 21=

23
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,880
I was blind

24
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,240
to treat you as a sister.

25
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,999
Outsiders envy you

26
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,360
for your success.

27
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,320
No one knows your sorrows.

28
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:06,569
Fortunately,

29
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,560
you're always by my side.

30
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,589
You're my maid,

31
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,320
but I always considered you my sister.

32
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,470
I, a woman,

33
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,950
maneuvered through
a game dominated by men for years.

34
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,320
Every move

35
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,590
has to be calculated carefully.

36
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,000
If you weren't here to talk to me,

37
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,120
I don't know how I could have survived.

38
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,209
I'm willing to follow you

39
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,560
and share your worries.

40
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,119
If He Youguang didn't trust me

41
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,470
from the beginning,

42
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,590
why didn't he just kill me?

43
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,159
Because he wants to use you

44
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,760
to win over the pirates.

45
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,229
I'm sorry.

46
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,800
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

47
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,200
Here.

48
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,769
When your father died,

49
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,329
He Youguang

50
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,589
kept you by his side

51
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,950
to avoid raising suspicion

52
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,200
and make himself look like a loyal man.

53
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,119
To make other brothers believe

54
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,639
that he won't kill his former brothers

55
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,030
even if he surrendered to the government,

56
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,769
he whitewashed the pirates

57
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,590
into garrison navy to return to the sea
under the guise of wiping out pirates.

58
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,449
This way,

59
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,919
he could consolidate his rule

60
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,800
and control the trade routes at sea.

61
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,590
I think

62
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,440
you know better than me

63
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,529
how much money he made

64
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,880
and how much he gave to his brothers

65
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,590
over the years.

66
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,000
Since you know these things so well,

67
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,270
you should have investigated
for a long time.

68
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,089
Who are you working for?

69
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,109
In the past few years,

70
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,779
He Youguang has been exploiting
the people of Lingnan, sucking them dry,

71
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:11,509
and transferring benefits
to Right Chancellor,

72
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:13,570
which is unacceptable
to Chang'an's upright officials.

73
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,719
Behind me stands the one
who can keep Right Chancellor in check

74
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,510
and bring He Youguang to justice.

75
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,440
Do you mean Left Chancellor?

76
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,359
He Youguang has committed
many heinous crimes over the years.

77
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,120
He deserves to die long ago.

78
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,000
If you join forces with us,

79
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,760
you can avenge your father.

80
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,889
I always believed

81
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,590
He Youguang was a good godfather,

82
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,209
so I never hid the ledgers

83
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,590
that could serve as evidence.

84
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,270
I kept them all
in the marketplace's study.

85
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,159
Lan.

86
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,510
Mr. Ma.

87
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,070
Cai, Guai.

88
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,680
So the man behind my father's
life-threatening fortune of 2,000 shares

89
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,920
was He Youguang.

90
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,920
I understand how you feel.

91
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,849
He also said

92
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,510
He Youguang set the fire

93
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,120
at Qijing Pavilion.

94
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,880
It burned Haihu to death.

95
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,030
After Amita found out,

96
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,390
she had a falling out with him.

97
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,000
She also hacked He Youguang.

98
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,640
The city gates are closed

99
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,800
to search for Amita.

100
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,869
At the end of the day,

101
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,289
Amita is also a victim.

102
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,599
If she's a victim,

103
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,950
what am I?

104
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,289
Ignorance is no crime.

105
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,750
She was also deceived.

106
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,049
After learning the truth,

107
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,230
she didn't side with He Youguang

108
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,990
and put herself in danger.

109
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,230
Calm down first.

110
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,230
Lan.

111
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,750
Can you do me a favor?

112
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,400
Go on.

113
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,519
Mr. Ma.

114
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,870
Look at this one.

115
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,560
It's our best fighter.

116
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,750
Healthy and invincible.

117
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,749
How old is it?

118
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,110
Three years old.

119
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,079
Mr. Ma. We have one that's four years old.

120
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,709
It's a little older,
but it's experienced and invincible.

121
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,109
It's unrivaled in Lingnan.

122
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,869
I'll get it for you.

123
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,230
Hurry.

124
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,160
Which chicken isn't fed?

125
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,159
That one.

126
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,920
It's too old and frail to be of any use.

127
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,599
It hasn't been fed for two days.

128
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,719
It's the one.

129
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,070
It's the one.

130
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,080
So I never hid the ledgers
that could serve as evidence.

131
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,990
I kept them all
in the marketplace's study.

132
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,400
This study is always guarded.

133
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,560
But Mr. Niu is a gambler.

134
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,359
He would go to the cockfighting arena

135
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,230
to play a few games
while He Youguang was away.

136
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,070
Mr. Niu.

137
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,200
I'll go play a couple of games.

138
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,989
Keep watch.

139
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,350
Alright.

140
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,110
Be careful.

141
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,750
Lan.

142
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,389
My Guan Yunchang

143
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,329
hasn't fought for a long time.

144
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,449
- Yes.
- Yes.

145
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,800
- Yes.
- Yes.

146
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,479
Friends.

147
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,400
Let's gather whatever money we have

148
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,870
and liven things up!

149
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,079
Gou'er, pour them.

150
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,990
- Alright.
- Alright.

151
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,750
Is that alright?

152
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,089
There's so much money.

153
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,689
We're just sparring.

154
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,209
No need to gamble everything you have.

155
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,590
Forgive my recklessness.
I didn't meant to work everyone up.

156
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,559
Sorry.

157
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,110
Come on, Zhang Wenyuan.

158
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,169
Zhang Wenyuan, go.

159
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,079
Win for me.

160
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,449
Win.

161
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,830
- Good.
- Good.

162
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,169
Is this your Zhang Wenyuan?

163
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,329
This is my Zhang Wenyuan.

164
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,440
Have you seen it before?
I'm afraid it'll scare everyone.

165
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,480
Zhang Wenyuan.

166
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:58,560
I'll take you up on it then.

167
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,169
Guan Yunchang versus Zhang Wenyuan.

168
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:01,839
Come on.

169
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,200
- Good.
- Good.

170
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,990
- Guan Yunchang.
- Guan Yunchang.

171
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,089
Hurry up.

172
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,399
It's starting.

173
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,680
Brothers of cockfighting arena.
What's going on over there?

174
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,239
Mr. Niu met a bold opponent today.

175
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,869
The opponent

176
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,929
brought a sickly chicken to fight.

177
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,320
Isn't it hopeless?

178
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,200
He put everything on the line.

179
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,750
Everyone who sees it will get a share.

180
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,230
Those who went to cheer will be paid.

181
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,160
Let's have a look.

182
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,719
Make way.

183
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,230
Can we go?

184
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,070
Do you think someone will steal books?

185
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,200
Besides, those taking over our shift
will be here soon.

186
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:40,879
Let's go?

187
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,230
Let's go.

188
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,480
Make way.

189
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,830
Get out of the way.

190
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,070
Bite it!

191
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,200
Mr. Niu.

192
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,169
Mr. Niu.

193
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:34,679
What?

194
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,929
Mr. Niu.

195
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:36,839
Tell me what you want.

196
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,519
Mr. Niu. Someone seemed
to have broken into the study.

197
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,440
What? Where's the intruder?
Did you catch them?

198
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,590
I didn't find them.

199
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:43,869
Idiot.

200
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,589
Hurry up.

201
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,950
Hurry up and follow me.

202
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,079
Let's go.

203
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,109
Hurry up.

204
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,230
He ran away
before the chickens finished fighting.

205
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:53,959
Collect the money!

206
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,849
Keep fighting.

207
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,200
Collect the money!

208
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,870
Are you sure nothing is missing?

209
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,070
All the books are there.

210
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,119
Fortunately,

211
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,990
I burned all the ledgers.

212
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,160
Looks like someone in Lingnan

213
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,800
is investigating me.

214
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,470
Zhao.

215
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,800
Any news from Amita?

216
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,800
Did you find any clues about the people

217
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,750
who died in the association?

218
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,920
Inspector.

219
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,350
We can't issue a citywide arrest warrant

220
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,209
and have to conduct a secret search.

221
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,279
That's why

222
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,680
the progress is delayed.

223
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,800
Offer a large reward.

224
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,230
Inform our ganster brothers

225
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,800
to help locate her.

226
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,280
I want to see

227
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,400
who in Lingnan

228
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,280
is watching me.

229
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,520
Investigate.

230
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,350
Li Shande!

231
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,950
Have you seen Li Shande?

232
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,990
Letter from Yan Yazhuang.

233
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,710
It works.

234
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,569
It works.

235
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,920
It works.

236
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,879
The path works.

237
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,280
It only takes one day
to go through Mount Dayu, not three.

238
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,089
We'll save two days.

239
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:36,049
- Good.
- Good.

240
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,400
Great!

241
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,200
Now, the last piece of the strategy
for litchi transport is complete.

242
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,209
Good!

243
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,560
It's complete.

244
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,680
Are you going back to Chang'an?

245
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,920
This

246
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,110
will decide

247
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,070
whether I live or die.

248
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,879
You must keep your promise

249
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,230
and come back on time.

250
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,350
This is the imperial litchi garden.

251
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,169
Not a single litchi is for sale.

252
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,159
They're all for you.

253
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,889
Yes, all for you.

254
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,400
- All for you.
- Not one is for sale.

255
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,159
Alright.

256
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,160
Let's go up the mountain

257
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,959
to pick the strongest litchi tree for Mr. Li

258
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,969
and chop off its branch for grafting.

259
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:38,799
Alright?

260
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,750
- Alright!
- Alright!

261
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,920
- Hurry.
- Hurry.

262
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,350
Hurry.

263
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,329
(Qiongshan Coconut Shop)

264
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,349
Sorry.

265
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,710
I'm late.

266
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,200
I'm really sorry.

267
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,520
Mr. Li has planned

268
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,710
the route for the litchi transport.

269
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,230
I hope you

270
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,440
can fulfill your promise
as soon as possible.

271
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,520
Inspector He is angry right now.

272
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,919
If we anger him,

273
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,329
he'll find an excuse

274
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,689
to seize our trade ships.

275
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,280
No one can bear it.

276
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,809
That's right.

277
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,469
Amita has been
with Inspector He for years,

278
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,710
and he just gave up on her.

279
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,639
If Inspector He gets angry at us,

280
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,440
our lives will be at risk.

281
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,869
We should hold on
to our money, do nothing,

282
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,040
and see how the situation develops.

283
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,239
But there's no turning back now.

284
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,959
If we sabotage things,

285
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,840
the transport will fail.

286
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,920
Mr. Li said

287
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,119
to cover the tree top

288
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,790
with this basket.

289
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,349
It can keep the litchis

290
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,959
from falling off during transport.

291
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,959
It's also breathable and water-permeable
to keep litchis alive.

292
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,990
So we need to weave it firmer.

293
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,790
We really

294
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,200
can't invest.

295
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,790
Xiao Yunchuan said

296
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,640
the litchi transport

297
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,639
isn't restricted by the ox bone vote.

298
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,270
We're free to decide.

299
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,959
But having said that,

300
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,030
he's clearly putting pressure on us.

301
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,440
Mr. Su. Officials are more powerful
than merchants.

302
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,840
When you're at someone else's mercy,

303
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,710
you can only give in.

304
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,399
Mr. Su.

305
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,289
We're informing you

306
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,470
out of consideration for our friendship.

307
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,990
Mr. Su, you should also withdraw.

308
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,440
I can relate to what you said.

309
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,990
Everyone hustles and bustles.

310
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,470
It's only natural
for merchants to seek profit.

311
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,640
But over the years,

312
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,160
Inspector He treated us

313
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,880
as gold beads and seashells,

314
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,750
threatening us at every turn
and exploiting us at will.

315
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,990
He doesn't keep his word
and has no credibility.

316
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,310
How reckless. He's killing the goose
that lays the golden eggs.

317
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,550
We won't make any profit or money.

318
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,950
If this goes on,

319
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,400
Hu merchants will never be successful.

320
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,230
The litchi transport

321
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,310
is a great opportunity

322
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,750
for me and everyone here.

323
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,880
It takes effort to succeed.

324
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,959
I'm going to risk

325
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,360
my old self to take another gamble.

326
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,470
Mr. Su.

327
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,080
There's only so much a person can do.

328
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,769
Don't force yourself.
This project is a bottomless funding pit.

329
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,200
If you really run it,

330
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,840
one person can't handle it.

331
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,389
Yes.

332
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,750
Faqi's right.

333
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,109
Mr. Su.

334
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,640
Think about it carefully.

335
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,849
There are so many beautiful words.

336
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,230
You wrote all of them?

337
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,510
You're amazing.

338
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:02,999
Can I have it?

339
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,360
You can't have this.

340
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,199
This is the strategy
for the litchi transport.

341
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,790
Once I get to Chang'an,
I have to use it to get approval.

342
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,440
It's official procedure.

343
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,809
The litchi transport
requires close cooperation

344
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,710
among many government agencies
to succeed.

345
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,080
I need to make sure this task

346
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,750
enters the official procedure.

347
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,510
I don't understand.

348
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,120
You don't understand. I meant...

349
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,049
I have to let my chief know
that litchis can be transported to Chang'an.

350
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,400
Mr. Li.

351
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,790
Mr. Su.

352
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,359
We're almost ready.

353
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:37,809
Alright.

354
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,470
There's no issue in theory. It depends
on what challenges lie on the way.

355
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,840
Sit down.

356
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,440
How satisfying.

357
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,590
Mr. Li.

358
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,009
The litchi transport

359
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,880
was a rotten deal from the start.

360
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,369
You actually

361
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,280
turned it into something remarkable.

362
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,640
Incredible.

363
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,980
Unbelievable.

364
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,960
But

365
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,030
I still have some lingering fears.

366
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,120
What if...

367
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,609
I'm saying what if...

368
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,860
Mr. Su.

369
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,960
This is my last chance.

370
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,089
Even if it costs my life,

371
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,360
I'll go through this until the end.

372
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,550
Even if there's a bottomless abyss ahead,
I've got to go ahead.

373
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,550
Good.

374
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,310
You either succeed or be nothing.

375
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,540
Your spirit

376
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:44,360
brings me to my knees.

377
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,920
Enough about this.

378
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,220
About the remaining funds...

379
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,329
It's still being raised.

380
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,719
But after five days, I...

381
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,839
Five days won't do.

382
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,199
Time waits for no one.

383
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,680
Today is already
the 7th day of the 4th month.

384
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,029
This litchis have been grafted.

385
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,360
I have to leave at the Chen Hour
the day after tomorrow.

386
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,880
The day after tomorrow.

387
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,480
The Chen Hour.

388
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,800
Mr. Li, don't worry.

389
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,639
Before the Chen Hour
the day after tomorrow,

390
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,950
I'll hand over the trip's expenses to you.

391
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,399
I heard those Hu merchants

392
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,429
can no longer hold back

393
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,470
and have started competing
for the leader position.

394
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,640
The leader position is like meat
hanging on the bow of a boat.

395
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,699
Fish of all sizes can't help

396
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,950
but want to fight for it.

397
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,230
Let them fight for it.

398
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:04,580
In hindsight, such empty titles
are just passing clouds.

399
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,920
So what if I looked successful
in front of others?

400
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,130
As soon as you're gone, you're forgotten

401
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,200
and will end up like this.

402
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,990
But Master Konglang,

403
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,080
I don't want
to wait for death in Lingnan.

404
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,840
I want to break the stalemate.

405
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,880
Have you thought of a way
to break the stalemate?

406
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,120
We couldn't obtain the ledgers,

407
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,839
but I handled all of them.

408
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,270
I'm a witness.

409
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,230
I want to go to Chang'an
and meet Left Chancellor.

410
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,790
Will you help me?

411
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,319
Shande.

412
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,520
Ping'an.

413
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,600
Are you going back to Chang'an?

414
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,049
I have to experiment

415
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,510
the transport myself.

416
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,230
I'm moving to the litchi garden.

417
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,580
Shande.

418
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,079
Sit.

419
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,849
I'm busy.

420
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,049
Sit here.

421
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:12,719
I'm busy.

422
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,569
Gou'er, get to work.

423
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,730
Yes.

424
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,790
What's the matter?

425
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,080
Do me a favor.

426
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,350
What favor?

427
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,990
Help me bring me someone.

428
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,840
You don't have to do this.

429
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,510
He's one of us.

430
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,200
Who do you want me to bring?

431
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:38,879
Amita.

432
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,230
Amita?

433
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,249
I remember I told you before that I wanted
to overthrow Right Chancellor.

434
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,729
We have the chance now.

435
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:45,809
Amita is an important

436
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,310
bargaining chip.

437
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,249
He Youguang is searching
for her all over the city.

438
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,840
If He Youguang finds her,

439
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,799
she will surely die.

440
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,310
If you take her to Chang'an,

441
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,400
she has a chance to survive.

442
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,680
No.

443
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,289
Isn't Amita

444
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,959
He Youguang's goddaughter?

445
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,310
What? He Youguang wants to kill her?

446
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,360
You don't have to do this.

447
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,880
He's one of us.

448
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,950
This is a long story.

449
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,559
I won't say more.

450
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,560
You have to tell me
even if it's a long story.

451
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,470
Just make it brief.

452
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,640
Amita's father

453
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,439
was killed by He Youguang.

454
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,089
He Youguang murdered

455
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,249
Amita's father.

456
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,679
Amita was kept in the dark

457
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,640
and treated her enemy as a father.

458
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,359
He Youguang was exposed.

459
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,769
Amita knows everything now.

460
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,159
Amita wants to go to Chang'an

461
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,510
to meet Left Chancellor.

462
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,919
If He Youguang can be brought down,

463
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,919
she can avenge her father.

464
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,809
If we can smoothly
take down Right Chancellor,

465
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,679
I can also avenge my father.

466
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,160
I don't know

467
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,600
if I made it clear.

468
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,200
No, why are you guys

469
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,310
avenging your fathers?

470
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,729
Avenging one's father

471
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,080
is unpleasant.

472
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,990
It's not that I won't help.

473
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,510
If we take down Right Chancellor,
our lives will be at risk.

474
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,710
We won't have time to bother with Amita.

475
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,529
I've figured it out for you.

476
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,489
Amita can be your rider.

477
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,769
She's a great rider. Think about it,
you have an official document.

478
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,080
When you pass checkpoints
and crossings, hide her.

479
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,470
She can help you

480
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,310
and will never hold you back.

481
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,080
When are you leaving?

482
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,950
I will leave at the Chen Hour
the day after tomorrow.

483
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,400
Which route are you taking?

484
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,429
I already told you.

485
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,200
I'm taking Mei Pass
from the litchi garden.

486
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,080
Wait for her.

487
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,750
Gou'er, let's go!

488
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,710
Gou'er.

489
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,200
Well...

490
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,990
Amita is in trouble.

491
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,640
Will the association's funds be alright?

492
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,400
Get me a new daybed.

493
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,280
I don't want the flowers too.
The sight of them annoys me.

494
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,470
Acting Leader.

495
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:01,199
Jafar and Haruen's fleets are fighting.

496
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,119
Please be the judge.

497
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,239
In the past,

498
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,049
Amita always gave priority to such cases.

499
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,550
How can we rush it?

500
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,360
Urgent cases must be dealt with slowly.

501
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,669
Seize their ships first.

502
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,920
Ask them to calm down first.

503
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,279
Go.

504
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,640
Alright.

505
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,960
What do you want?

506
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,710
Such matters must be handled urgently.

507
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,119
Even with careful planning,

508
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,030
you'll still run into obstacles.

509
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,880
- Why don't you do it first?
- Mr. Su.

510
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,270
Handle the problems as they come. Go.

511
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,470
Mr. Su.

512
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,200
Mr. Xiao.

513
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,609
Sorry, Mr. Su.

514
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:49,729
I'm busy with work.

515
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:50,950
Sorry for neglecting you.

516
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:51,809
Don't blame me.

517
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,160
Not at all.

518
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,550
I

519
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,680
came to congratulate the new leader.

520
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,990
I'm just acting leader.

521
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,790
The appointment of a new leader
is refreshing.

522
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,809
The association
has been completely transformed

523
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,289
and is thriving.

524
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,840
Congratulations.

525
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,400
Getting promoted to the official leader

526
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,440
is just around the corner.

527
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,640
May your words come true.

528
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,470
Take a seat.

529
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,840
Why are you here today?

530
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,400
Firstly, to congratulate you.

531
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,160
Secondly...

532
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,160
Secondly, we have something to discuss.

533
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,359
If you're here today

534
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,440
to discuss the association's
withdrawal of investment

535
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,750
in the litchi transport,

536
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,990
you'd better say nothing.

537
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,389
I'm just an acting leader.

538
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,200
We have so many elders here.

539
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,120
I can't control them.

540
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,310
The world is ever-changing.

541
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,710
It's natural for business people

542
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,880
to seek profit and avoid harm.

543
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,550
Everyone has their own ambitions.

544
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,160
I won't force it.

545
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,510
But

546
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,950
I've given everything I have

547
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,030
for the litchi transport.

548
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,160
I won't give up easily.

549
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,440
Don't worry.

550
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,159
First,

551
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,119
I won't ask for money.

552
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,950
Second,
I won't force you to do anything.

553
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,510
I just want...

554
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,160
I just want to discuss with you

555
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,680
that I still have a trade ship.

556
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,750
Will you take this boat

557
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:54,640
for old times' sake?

558
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,950
Leave first.

559
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,120
You should leave too.

560
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,680
Mr. Su.

561
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,249
Are you selling the ship

562
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,840
to invest in Litchi Envoy?

563
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:30,909
Yes.

564
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,359
You're betting

565
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,519
all your fortune on him.

566
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,120
I'm willing to take a gamble.

567
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,519
Well...

568
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,769
You must have

569
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:40,160
given me horses

570
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,529
because you foresaw

571
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,200
the potential of litchi transport.

572
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:50,249
No need to worry.

573
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:54,030
I sold the ship.

574
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,049
I invested in Litchi Envoy.

575
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,470
You won't be implicated

576
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,550
in any way for this.

577
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,640
After the deal is done,

578
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,160
in addition to the previous deal,

579
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:23,750
I'm willing to share
another 1.5% of the profit

580
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,680
with you.

581
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,920
How much for the ship?

582
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:49,310
60% of its original price.

583
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,710
Alright.

584
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,080
I'll take your ship.

585
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,440
Take this too.

586
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,990
But remember,

587
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,769
You guys are helping Mr. Li

588
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,680
with his transport for me.

589
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,360
Don't embarrass me.

590
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,270
Be the most stable and fastest rider.

591
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,329
Lan.

592
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,680
Why do you want to help Litchi Envoy?

593
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,080
We're trying to make a living in Lingnan.

594
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:29,750
We will never make it big.

595
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,049
Mr. Li

596
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,769
will transport litchis to Chang'an.

597
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,440
It's a good opportunity.

598
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,790
I want a chance at a future.

599
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,329
Don't worry.

600
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,049
We'll help you

601
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:45,710
get a chance at a future.

602
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,080
You're also

603
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,640
getting a chance at a future.

604
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,849
- Yes!
- Yes!

605
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,040
Alright, go.

606
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,999
Lan.

607
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,360
Take care.

608
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,569
Chief Scribe Zhao.

609
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,679
What a rare guest.

610
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,159
- Lan.
- What happened?

611
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,529
Did Chicken Daddy's chickens

612
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,359
get defeated again?

613
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,230
Mind if I take a sip of your water?

614
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,080
We can't bother about the chickens.

615
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,470
Lan.

616
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,919
You have a lot of connections
on the street.

617
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,440
Help me find someone.

618
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,220
Who?

619
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,950
- Amita.
- Amita?

620
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,640
Inspector He is my client.

621
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:57,080
I will do my best

622
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,950
to find the person he's looking for.

623
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,750
That's great.

624
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,510
You won't be mistreated.
Inspector He will pay you 100 guan.

625
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,680
Enough for you
to open another cockfighting arena.

626
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,910
Thank you.

627
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,480
Li.

628
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:07,000
Are you worried
that the horses won't have enough to eat

629
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,200
and will run slowly tomorrow?

630
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,000
Thank you for these days, Li.

631
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:25,560
Thank you.

632
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,870
You can't ride a horse.

633
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,910
I won't take you with me

634
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,680
to Chang'an tomorrow,

635
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,159
but I promise

636
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,729
I'll bring you some good wine
from Chang'an when I return.

637
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:36,920
Alright?

638
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,999
Are you saying

639
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,469
you'll go back to Inspector's Office

640
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:06,000
after I leave tomorrow?

641
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,999
You can't go back.

642
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,169
They're all bad guys.

643
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,199
Just stay here.

644
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,750
Just stay in the litchi garden.

645
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,790
Do you understand?

646
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,679
Fine, I...

647
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,909
When I come back,

648
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:30,350
I will immediately pick you up
at Inspector's Office, alright?

649
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,529
If Chief Scribe Zhao and the others

650
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,319
bully you and beat you again,

651
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,909
I'll...

652
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,270
I'll reason with them.

653
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,680
This one.

654
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,560
They've added more soldiers
at the city gates today.

655
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,640
Even the goods
must be opened for inspection.

656
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,350
Getting someone out might be...

657
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,990
Stop.

658
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,919
Inspection.

659
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,989
By the Chen Hour tomorrow,

660
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:20,310
we must send Amita out of the city

661
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,160
to meet Mr. Li at the litchi garden.

662
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,769
I'm afraid we have to take a risk.

663
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,120
Master Konglang.

664
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,649
Even if it means risking my life,

665
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,000
I'll try my best.

666
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,750
Who's in the cart?

667
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,169
Konglang Guild is running an errand
for Chief Scribe Zhao.

668
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,790
If you don't believe me,
verify with Chief Scribe Zhao.

669
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:42,200
If you delay important matters,
are you willing to take responsibility?

670
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:45,480
I'm willing to help you
divert the pursuers.

671
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,480
Ms. Amita.

672
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,600
Ms. Amita.

673
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,960
I caused this.

674
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,649
I hope you can give me

675
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,390
a chance to redeem myself.

676
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:03,080
Go.

677
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:16,599
Chief Scribe Zhao.

678
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,960
What happened?

679
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,609
Lan sent a message

680
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,430
that he saw Amita outside the city.

681
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,160
She ran toward the port.

682
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,129
Are you sure he said Amita?

683
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,480
Absolutely.

684
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,039
Inform Captain Yang.

685
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,240
Yes.

686
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,310
Unload the cart.

687
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,870
Stop for inspection.

688
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,390
What goods are in it?

689
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,769
Unload it.

690
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:50,239
Inspector He ordered

691
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,640
that all carts must be strictly checked.

692
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,320
Wait!

693
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,600
Sir.

694
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,640
I'm from the cockfighting arena.

695
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,910
This cart is full of gamecocks.

696
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,790
It's alright if you don't know me.

697
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,169
But you should recognize these chickens.

698
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,689
I don't care about chickens.

699
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,040
Unload it.

700
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,830
Lan.

701
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,280
Mr. Ma.

702
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,310
It's really you.

703
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,360
What's going on?

704
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,780
Chickens.

705
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,500
Whose chickens?

706
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,980
Chicken Daddy's chickens.

707
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:37,620
Sir.

708
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,020
This is Chicken Daddy's teacher.

709
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:40,829
As the saying goes,

710
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,860
once a teacher, always a father.

711
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:46,860
It's bad if you don't know him.

712
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,820
What's bad with that?

713
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,300
Why should I know him?

714
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,900
Who is this Chicken Daddy?

715
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,460
It's dangerous to say that.

716
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,780
You don't even know Chicken Daddy?

717
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,700
Where's the gate official?

718
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,940
Gate official.

719
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,069
Gate official!

720
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,420
Who's shouting for me?

721
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,989
Mr. Ma.

722
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:23,540
You didn't educate
your subordinate well.

723
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,180
He doesn't even know
who Chicken Daddy is.

724
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,140
Yes.

725
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,869
It's my fault for not teaching them

726
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:33,100
knowledge and experience.

727
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:36,980
Lan, are you transporting

728
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,629
Inspector He's chickens

729
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,860
in the cart?

730
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,820
You got a good eye.

731
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,029
They're indeed Inspector He's chickens.

732
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,349
I plan to take them
to the mountain forest for a stroll.

733
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,429
But this guy

734
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,749
insists that I unload the cart.

735
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,669
If the chickens are frightened

736
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,620
and Inspector He comes after me,

737
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,829
I'll unload it

738
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,180
if you can take the blame.

739
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,700
It's a misunderstanding.

740
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,060
It's his job.

741
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,340
No need to unload it,

742
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,669
but we still have to check it.

743
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,869
Yes.

744
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,789
After all, it was
Inspector He's order. Right?

745
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,469
It's also their job.

746
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,549
Here, Lan.

747
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,509
We have to cooperate.

748
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,260
Here, let them check.

749
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,709
I trained this chicken for two months.

750
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,989
They're cultivating their energy

751
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,340
and can't be exposed to light.

752
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,620
You decide.

753
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,549
Amita was spotted at the port!

754
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:44,980
Except for the city gate guards,
the rest must go to the port!

755
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:56,460
Gamecocks are vicious.
There's no place to hide people.

756
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,149
Let them go.

757
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,909
Thank you.

758
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,260
Go.

759
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,380
Go!

760
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,429
Go!

761
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:23,949
Ms. Amita, I will wait for you at sea

762
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,340
if I can escape this time.

763
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,100
Take care.

764
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,609
Go!

765
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:32,729
Over there!

766
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:33,349
Hurry!

767
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,349
- Go!
- Hurry up!

768
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:37,229
=The Litchi Road=

769
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,820
If you fail again this time,

770
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:43,220
how should I deal with you?

771
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:47,420
Even if I fail,

772
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,540
I want to know

773
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:55,620
how far I am from the end.

774
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:58,940
Thank you for saving me.

775
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,380
