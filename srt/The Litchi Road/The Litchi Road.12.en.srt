00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,900
(Ju)

00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,860
=Episode 12=

4
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,100
Ma Guiyun really said that?

5
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,780
Yes.

6
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,340
So are we giving him

7
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,580
the horses or not?

8
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,709
If we do, it makes us look guilty.

9
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,260
If we don't,

10
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,229
that lunatic might flip out

11
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,180
and drag us all down with him.

12
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,629
I doubt Li Shande

13
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,060
is that shrewd.

14
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,940
Ma Guiyun's words are not to be taken
at face value.

15
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,740
You just started

16
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,149
dealing with him.

17
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,660
You do not understand.

18
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,469
The first time I met him,

19
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,789
I also thought

20
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,109
he was just some foolish, dull bumpkin.

21
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,700
I later realized

22
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,820
he is unpredictable and very clever.

23
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,380
I think we should just give him the horses.

24
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,660
It is only a test anyway.

25
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,260
Let's see

26
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,749
what kind of trouble he can stir up.

27
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,300
I just can't accept it.

28
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,469
We spent so much effort

29
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,349
laying this trap, digging this pit,

30
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,020
and now he just breaks through it.

31
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,660
I can't accept that.

32
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,380
Zhao.

33
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,589
You always say that you two

34
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,229
are evenly matched,

35
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,860
worthy rivals.

36
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,540
Why are you so quiet now?

37
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,580
If he were a dog,

38
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,109
you feed him, tame him,

39
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,540
and maybe he becomes your pet.

40
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,029
But this man is like a taotie.

41
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,620
His greed knows no end.

42
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,720
I'm afraid if we give him the horses,
he will keep asking for more.

43
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,580
If we have to give them,

44
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,820
let's be smart about it.

45
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,420
Over there, sir.

46
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,060
Mr. Li.

47
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,829
Our leader, hearing of your troubles,

48
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,109
specially had two fine horses

49
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,829
brought from Lingnan,

50
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,420
and sent me to deliver them
to you as a gift.

51
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,020
No, I told your leader

52
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,420
I needed 100 fine horses.

53
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,349
Ms. Amita said,

54
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,869
although these horses are untamed,

55
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,429
they are full of spirit.

56
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,309
With skilled riders,

57
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,269
each could be worth 100 on their own.

58
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,389
With these two, you have 200.

59
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,180
That's not the same.

60
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,949
Can they really travel

61
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,909
1,000 li in one day?

62
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,180
Absolutely.

63
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,520
This is Rixing. The other is Qianli.
[*Rixing and Qianli means travel 1,000 li in one day]

64
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,309
Ms. Amita

65
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,189
wishes you triumph

66
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,980
and success in your trials.

67
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,620
We take our leave.

68
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,109
The women of Lingnan

69
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,620
are really something.

70
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,300
They are clever and tactful.

71
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,020
She delivered the horses, all right.

72
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,820
Willingly and respectfully.

73
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,949
I did not expect them
to be this cunning.

74
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,509
Using this method to brush us off.

75
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,389
Shande, listen.

76
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,389
You cannot seriously be mad at me.

77
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,580
Shande!

78
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,109
Can you find me the best riders

79
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,660
in Lingnan?

80
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,780
Are you crazy?

81
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,829
I have seen those two horses.

82
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,660
They belonged to He Youguang.
He gave them just to mess with us.

83
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,140
They are wild horses.

84
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,220
Horses that have broken a lot of ribs.

85
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,469
You cannot be serious.

86
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,209
I am serious.

87
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,429
We have no choice but to adapt.

88
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,589
Worst case,

89
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,780
if they really are good horses,

90
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,469
I will use them as the vanguard

91
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,549
in the first trial run.

92
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,180
We're splitting into four routes, right?

93
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,109
Two won't be enough.

94
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,039
Well, what else can we do?
You're Ma Guiyun.

95
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,909
You sort this out.

96
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,600
Figure out
how we're getting the rest of them!

97
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,860
This one looks tasty. Try it.

98
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,460
Li!

99
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,669
Litchi Envoy!

100
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,860
Li!

101
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,380
Li Shande!

102
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,260
Over here, Li!

103
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,780
Did you crawl out of the mud?

104
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,709
Did you fall off the horse or something?

105
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,900
Don't remind me.

106
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,020
They told me these were fine horses.

107
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,040
But their temper is terrible.
They would not let me get on.

108
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,100
I tied myself to them with a hemp rope,

109
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,180
and they threw me right off.

110
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,780
Look at me.

111
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,420
Slow down.

112
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,749
Careful!

113
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,940
Take it easy.

114
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,980
Don't push yourself.

115
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,509
I was just like that earlier.

116
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,520
Yan Yazhuang, don't bite off
more than you can chew!

117
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,340
Get out of the way!

118
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,580
Way to go, Yan Yazhuang!

119
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,069
Did not expect you

120
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,309
to have these skills.

121
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,420
I thought all you could ride
was a donkey.

122
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,549
This horse may be hot-tempered,

123
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,460
but it is a fine steed.

124
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:45,189
If an expert rider were to tame it,
it could travel a thousand li a day,

125
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,189
swift as the wind.

126
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,700
You're the expert
I've been searching for.

127
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,829
I hereby recruit you as a rider

128
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,509
for the litchi transport trial.

129
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,469
Once Su gets back,

130
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,900
he will pay you.

131
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,620
Rider?

132
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,989
Who said I wanted to be a rider?

133
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,180
Yan Yazhuang.

134
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,709
You are the only one
who can mount this horse.

135
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,780
This money should be yours.

136
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,869
That money is enough to feed

137
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,660
and clothe you for half a year.

138
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,540
I'm not doing it
no matter how much you pay me.

139
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,580
Yan Yazhuang.

140
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,869
Listen to me.

141
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,029
Li Shande's business

142
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,240
is the litchi garden's business.

143
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,189
And the litchi garden's business
is your business.

144
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,820
You're doing this
whether you like it or not.

145
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,869
I'm not

146
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,060
changing my mind.

147
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,540
End of discussion.

148
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,020
Yan Yazhuang!

149
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,380
Yan Yazhuang!

150
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,380
Yan Yazhuang!

151
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,860
Why will you not help with this?

152
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,660
Why should I help him?

153
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,060
That Li Shande is unreliable.

154
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,069
Always going on about

155
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,469
how he is the Litchi Envoy

156
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,940
appointed by His Majesty.

157
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,549
But if that were true,

158
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,700
why won't the Inspector's Office help him?

159
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,949
He walks around all day

160
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,220
with that plaque of his aimlessly.

161
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,620
He doesn't even have a proper office.

162
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,949
It's obvious he isn't a proper envoy.

163
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,750
Why should we follow his orders?

164
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,829
In the past,
most of the litchi garden's harvest

165
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,349
had to be turned in as taxes

166
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,700
to the local government.

167
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,109
He turned this place

168
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,980
into an imperial litchi garden.

169
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,829
With His Majesty's protection,

170
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,300
no one dares bully us anymore.

171
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,389
Once it's the sixth month

172
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,549
and the litchis are delivered
to Chang'an,

173
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,260
I'll able to hand out
this year's harvest to everyone.

174
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,300
He is helping us.

175
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,180
And what if he can't get them
to Chang'an?

176
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,860
Our livelihoods depend
on this litchi garden.

177
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,580
We worked the whole season.

178
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,740
What if we get nothing in the end?

179
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,429
This garden feeds a lot of people.
We have many mouths to feed.

180
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,460
What will we do if he fails?

181
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,010
Do you really think Li Shande cares?

182
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,460
Even if he does care,

183
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,829
he's barely making ends meet himself.

184
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,020
What can he do?

185
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:04,540
Why... Why are you so determined
to trust him?

186
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,980
The first time I met Li Shande was

187
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,980
at the market.

188
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,620
A few thugs came looking for trouble.

189
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,420
He stepped in and helped me out.

190
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,160
The second time was
at the litchi garden.

191
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,429
Officials from the Inspector's Office
sent a bunch of people to seize the garden.

192
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,660
He helped resolve the situation again.

193
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,549
He is an official,

194
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,300
but has none of that arrogance.

195
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,060
Not only does he work alongside us,

196
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,509
he also goes to great lengths

197
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,620
to come up with ideas
to preserve the litchis.

198
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,840
Would someone go through all that just
to cheat us out of one season's harvest?

199
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,260
Yan Yazhuang.

200
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,480
You were once an outsider
to the litchi garden too.

201
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,780
You know,

202
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,269
the Dong people may be simple-minded,

203
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,580
but we are not fools.

204
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,420
We can tell good from bad.

205
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,140
Li Shande helped us.

206
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,889
If we turn a blind eye now,

207
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,660
we are asking for divine punishment.

208
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,860
He may be your benefactor,

209
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,820
but he is not mine.

210
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,500
I do not want

211
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:19,340
to stick my neck out for this.

212
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,700
You are a fine steed indeed.

213
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,260
Fast as the wind.

214
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,140
But a temper to match the tempest.

215
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,420
Too much of a temper.

216
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,820
Still, you are luckier than me.

217
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,940
Much luckier.

218
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,589
I thought you were just a mad horse,

219
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,180
trapped in a stable.

220
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,380
But you found someone
who understands you.

221
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,900
And now,

222
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,820
you get to shine.

223
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,140
Li Shande.

224
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,860
I'm sorry. He can't be your rider.

225
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,220
Why not?

226
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,180
Is it because of the payment?

227
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,460
No.

228
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,100
You're one of us now.
I don't want to lie to you.

229
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,100
He is a deserter.

230
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,580
I have never asked why he ran,

231
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,340
but I know he is not a bad person.

232
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,629
My father who took him in.

233
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,269
When my father was ill,

234
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,980
someone tried to seize
the litchi garden.

235
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,900
He fought them off with all he had.

236
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,180
Got some nasty scars from that.

237
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,909
All these years,

238
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,660
I have treated him like my own brother.

239
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,700
So if he thinks riding
for you is too risky,

240
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,460
I won't force him.

241
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,980
You're right.

242
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,620
We shouldn't force people into things.

243
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,060
To be honest,

244
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,900
even having one rider

245
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,149
will not solve the urgent need

246
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,580
for a four-route trial.

247
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,020
I will think of something else.

248
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,429
Su, it really is unfortunate timing.

249
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,869
There is a horse plague going around.

250
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,840
Not the best time
for trading horses, you see.

251
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,669
It's the truth.

252
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,900
Hadi.

253
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,620
You are not being honest with me.

254
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,820
I'm telling the truth.

255
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,460
I know

256
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,109
you are just afraid of offending Amita.

257
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,300
Su.

258
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,380
If you already know that,

259
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,580
why are you putting me
in this difficult spot?

260
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,820
The Merchants' Association was supposed
to be a place for Hu merchants

261
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,340
to support each other.

262
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,740
Yet, everyone lives in fear
of its leader now.

263
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,780
How pathetic.

264
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,789
I heard that Amita secretly bought

265
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,460
a large batch of colored glaze
from Sasan,

266
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,620
and she wants to keep
all the profits for herself.

267
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,220
Yet, she demands

268
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,940
a share of your business.

269
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,860
How despicable.

270
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,340
Are you all willing to stay silent
and let yourselves be taken advantage of?

271
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,020
Amita has Inspector He behind her.

272
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,580
Who can do business in Lingnan

273
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,940
without going through him?

274
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,509
The tolls at checkpoints

275
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,060
are unavoidable.

276
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,940
If they can grease the wheels
at the Maritime Trade Office,

277
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,460
what is the harm in giving them a cut?

278
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,269
Today,

279
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,500
they take 10%.

280
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,860
Tomorrow,

281
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,749
they will find a way

282
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,460
to demand 50%.

283
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,940
You joined the Merchants' Association
the latest.

284
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,949
You're a small boat.

285
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,309
If a storm comes,

286
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,980
you will be the first to capsize.

287
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,660
I heard

288
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:03,260
you are trying to charm Amita?

289
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,780
Just my guess.

290
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,269
I doubt you have
genuine affections for her.

291
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,580
You are just trying

292
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:14,620
to board her ship with the full sails.

293
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,540
But you had better think carefully.

294
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,949
Once you get on her ship,

295
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,580
she will have you by the nose,

296
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,909
and you will be

297
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,780
forever trapped in Lingnan.

298
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,620
We are helping Mr. Li transport litchis

299
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,029
so we can one day free ourselves

300
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,700
from Amita's control.

301
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,540
I, Su Liang,

302
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,620
do not do losing business.

303
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,540
The route to Chang'an

304
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,389
will open up many,

305
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,980
many new business opportunities.

306
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,980
Just think about it.

307
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,980
Is that not the perfect chance for you?

308
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,580
Su.

309
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,149
Why are you here?

310
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,420
Mr. Li.

311
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,979
I went to the post station
looking for you.

312
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,660
They said you went to the litchi garden.

313
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,420
With the sun setting,

314
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,780
I figured you would be back by now,

315
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,380
so I waited here to welcome you.

316
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,740
What is it?

317
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,580
Here is the thing.

318
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,580
For transporting the litchis

319
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,380
across four routes all at once,

320
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,780
we need a lot of good horses.

321
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,860
If...

322
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,909
I mean, if.

323
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,149
If we can't procure enough fine steeds,

324
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:40,300
will inferior ones really not suffice?

325
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,509
It's 5,000 li to Chang'an.

326
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,700
Yes.

327
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,540
Even the best horses will be pushed
to their limits, let alone inferior ones.

328
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,420
I ran the numbers.

329
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,669
On the road to Chang'an,

330
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,829
there is a post station

331
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,420
roughly every 30 li.

332
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,149
Average horses will be exhausted

333
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,149
before even reaching one.

334
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,300
Those calculations would be pointless.

335
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,549
If we can have fine horses

336
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,020
relaying back and forth,

337
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,869
perhaps that would solve the problem.

338
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,300
Relaying back and forth?

339
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,380
Like mill donkeys.

340
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,380
Even if a donkey walks 1,000 li,

341
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,980
it is only going in circles
in a small space.

342
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,340
A relay...

343
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,780
Wait...

344
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,060
I think I might have an idea.

345
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,860
Let me go back and do some math.

346
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,300
I'll do the calculations again!

347
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,189
Should I still keep looking for horses?

348
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,460
Yes!

349
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,340
What about donkeys?

350
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,460
What is he tinkering with now?

351
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,780
He is making a "ju."

352
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,100
A "ju"?

353
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,340
What for?

354
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,509
A ju is a measuring tool.

355
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,870
It is made of two perpendicular arms.

356
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,429
The short arm is called the gou,

357
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,140
the long one is the gu.

358
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,989
Both arms have markings.

359
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,109
Its most direct use

360
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,740
is to measure right angles.

361
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,949
Back in the Western Zhou,
the mathematician Shang Gao

362
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,820
discovered the gou-gu numbers.

363
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,140
Using the ju,
you can calculate all sorts of things.

364
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,180
Use the level ju to straighten a rope.

365
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,980
Tilt the ju to measure height.

366
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,340
Flip it to gauge depth.

367
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,820
Lay it down flat to measure distance.

368
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,040
Circle it around
to form a perfect round.

369
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,480
Join them to create a square.

370
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,140
You're putting me to sleep.

371
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,189
Li Shande.

372
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,740
Explain what you are trying to do here.

373
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,740
Li, hand me a rope.

374
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,149
Higher.

375
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,340
Higher.

376
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,949
If this ju's angle aligns

377
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,669
with that angle,

378
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,069
then we can tell

379
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,420
whether this rope is level.

380
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,260
This is "leveling the ju
to straighten the rope."

381
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,460
If we want to know how tall that tree is...

382
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,140
Move aside, Li.

383
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,149
First,

384
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,100
we measure the distance
from me to the tree.

385
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,300
Then, use the ju

386
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,620
to sight the tree top,

387
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:52,740
and mark the scale
where the line of sight aligns with the tip.

388
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,939
By the principle of proportionality,

389
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,580
we can calculate the tree's height.

390
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,100
This is "tilting the ju to measure height."

391
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,949
Same principle applies

392
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,460
to gauging depth and distance.

393
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,540
That's "flipping the ju to measure depth,"
and "laying it down to measure distance."

394
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,900
If we put two jus together,

395
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,860
we can form a circle.

396
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,429
In this world,
there are squares and circles.

397
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,949
With both, we can measure anything.

398
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,229
That's all there is to it.

399
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,420
Understand?

400
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,500
I still don't understand everything,

401
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,860
but it sounds impressive.

402
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:32,909
Sorry.

403
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,500
I was showing off.

404
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:37,100
So, what exactly
are you trying to measure?

405
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,060
Who here knows
the roads of Lingnan best?

406
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,049
Yan Yazhuang, of course.

407
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,920
He could find his way
with his eyes closed.

408
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,749
Yes.

409
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,600
- That's true.
- What road are you looking for?

410
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,629
Can you go with me

411
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,069
to Small East Gate tomorrow?

412
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,540
You will know when we get there.

413
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:53,829
You guide the way,

414
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,100
and I will do the calculations.

415
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,989
Yan Yazhuang, you can't turn down

416
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,660
this favor now, can you?

417
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,069
When do we leave?

418
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,380
Third quarter of the Mao hour.
I'll see you at Small East Gate.

419
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,909
Mr. Li.

420
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,580
What kind of road are you looking for?

421
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,860
Ideally, a loop.

422
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,580
About 20 li of flat road

423
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,989
and 10 li of mountain road,

424
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:22,700
so that we can circle back
to where we started.

425
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,429
(East Gate, Small East Gate)
(The idea of a loop trial run)

426
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,660
(was like carving out a sliver
of hope in a desperate situation.)

427
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,360
(All that was left
was to find a capable rider,)

428
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,989
(and the plan would be complete.)

429
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,520
(East Gate, Small East Gate, South Gate)

430
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,580
(Xiu'er,)

431
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,820
(I am staking everything on this.)

432
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,780
- 95!
- (I am now one step closer to Chang'an.)

433
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,220
All right.

434
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,540
Can you manage it, Li?

435
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,579
(Great North Gate,
Small North Gate, East Gate)

436
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,429
Stop.

437
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,620
Stop.

438
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,309
(Great North Gate,
Small East Gate, South Gate, West Gate)

439
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,949
(Total distance: 30 li)

440
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,709
I brought some cheese for Amita.

441
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,149
Serve this drizzled with honey
I made myself.

442
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,349
She is sure to love it.

443
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,940
Go get her so she can try it.

444
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,669
Hadi, Ms. Amita is unwell today.

445
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,869
She is not receiving visitors.

446
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:40,749
Please leave.

447
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,660
Is she down with a cold?

448
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,429
I know a bit of medicine.
Let me in to take a look.

449
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,620
Hadi.

450
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,300
Ms. Amita's bedchamber is not
for someone like you to enter.

451
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,709
Ms. Hongyu.

452
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,100
I also came

453
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,500
to confirm a rumor.

454
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,740
I heard

455
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,229
she plans to import

456
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,500
a large shipment of colored glaze
from Sasan.

457
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,900
Is that true?

458
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,909
I'm just a maid.

459
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:12,100
I don't know anything about that.

460
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,309
Please ask Ms. Amita yourself

461
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,809
when she recovers.

462
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,860
- Maybe...
- Well, things sure are lively today.

463
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,580
Mr. Ma.

464
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,709
Ms. Amita is unwell.

465
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,180
She is not receiving visitors.
You should go too.

466
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,700
Unwell?

467
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,860
Is it a cold?

468
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,789
I know some medicine.

469
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,869
Let me check on her.

470
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,060
Stop right there!

471
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,340
You think you can just walk
into Ms. Amita's bedchamber?

472
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,189
Who are you?

473
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,700
That's my question.

474
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,469
I see you brought a token of affection.

475
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,660
What's the matter?

476
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,069
Amita did not accept it?

477
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,469
Better than showing up

478
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,180
empty-handed, no?

479
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,469
May I ask your name?

480
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,589
Hadi.

481
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,309
I also have a Tang name.

482
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,749
Xiao Yunchuan.

483
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,420
Xiao Yunchuan.

484
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,660
With a "Yun" in it too.

485
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,229
How about this?

486
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,229
Since Amita is not in a state

487
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,449
to receive guests,

488
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,989
why do you and I find a place

489
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,020
to get to know each other better?

490
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,380
Us?

491
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,989
All right.

492
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,459
Let's go. I am not afraid of you.

493
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,870
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

494
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,380
- Do let Amita know I was here.
- Come on!

495
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,140
I'll be right back.

496
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,060
You and I should admire
each other as heroes.

497
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,020
But alas, we both have
good taste in women.

498
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,380
For this fated bond,

499
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,060
Yunchuan,

500
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,700
I drink to you.

501
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:04,860
How long have you been pursuing Amita?

502
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,420
Three years.

503
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,709
For the past three years,

504
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,260
I've tended to her every need and whim.

505
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,589
Now,

506
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,940
I am her trusted confidant.

507
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,580
I'm just a step away

508
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,069
from becoming her lover.

509
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,300
Just a step away?

510
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,789
Obviously,

511
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,380
you do not understand women.

512
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,860
Women are easy to move emotionally.

513
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,380
You have courted her for three years.

514
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,960
If she liked you even a little,

515
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,640
she would have forced herself
to accept your affections,

516
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,240
even if she found them nauseating.

517
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,380
You can be her trusted confidant.
A close friend.

518
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,580
But never a lover.

519
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,740
Yunchuan.

520
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,540
Give it up.

521
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,100
You never had a chance.

522
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,780
Me? Give up?

523
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,820
And you think you have a shot?

524
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,820
What do you even have?

525
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,300
Talent?

526
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,900
Looks?

527
00:27:09,565 --> 00:27:10,740
You are being shallow.

528
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,540
I never try

529
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,380
to impress women with my appearance.

530
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,500
My strengths lie...

531
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,420
That is awfully rude of you.

532
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,660
Is my advantage not obvious?

533
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,260
I hail from Chang'an.

534
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,109
So what if you are from the capital?

535
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,300
Of course, it matters.

536
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,300
Because I am from Chang'an,

537
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:40,949
I do not conflict

538
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,820
with Amita's interests in Lingnan.

539
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,500
She tells me

540
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,580
all her local dealings,

541
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,620
but not you. Never with you.

542
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,420
She can't and she won't.

543
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,620
Isn't that right?

544
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,300
Like what?

545
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,340
If you can't name any,

546
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,229
then you're just lying to me.

547
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,740
Why would I lie?

548
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,420
She told me

549
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,829
that she used to be wary

550
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,100
of transporting expensive goods by sea,

551
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,500
but now she isn't,

552
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,740
because she has military protection.

553
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,180
Military?

554
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,540
No need to speak of it aloud,

555
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,420
lest disaster follows loose lips.

556
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,069
There were rumors of her purchasing

557
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,140
a large shipment of colored glaze
from Sasan.

558
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,140
I didn't believe them.

559
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,069
She used to avoid

560
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,580
the Sasan trade routes entirely.

561
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:45,500
Did she change her mind
because she found a backer?

562
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,340
She told me not to share this

563
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,220
with another soul.

564
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,860
Said to wait

565
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,660
until the time is right.

566
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,660
At the very least,

567
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,880
not until after the leadership change
in the Hu Merchants' Association.

568
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:06,260
But today, I felt a connection with you,

569
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,300
so I let a little more slip.

570
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,700
We are both entangled by love.

571
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,900
- Heed my advice...
- Thank you for your honesty, Mr. Ma.

572
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,420
I dare not compete with you.

573
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,700
Please, do as you wish.

574
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,140
I won't disturb you further.

575
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,060
Thanks for the hospitality.

576
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,900
Farewell.

577
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,220
Mr. Hadi,

578
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,740
you have a heavy heart
after drinking with that man.

579
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,340
In the past...

580
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,900
When our cargo ships arrived in port,

581
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,069
to keep the shipping route open,

582
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,549
we only needed to give Amita

583
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,189
10% of our profits, yes?

584
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,380
Yes.

585
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,560
But if what he said is true,

586
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,189
and even the sea routes
are now under Inspector He's control,

587
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,669
then once our ships leave the port,

588
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,469
we will be exploited

589
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,029
by them both at every turn.

590
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,229
That means soon

591
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,429
they'll have absolute power,

592
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,180
and we will have to play by their rules.

593
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,500
Su is right.

594
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,100
As long as we are trapped in Lingnan,

595
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:22,100
we will always be at their mercy.

596
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:22,989
We will be led around

597
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,500
by the nose forever.

598
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,780
It is time we find another path.

599
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,380
You.

600
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,709
Choose the finest horses

601
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,180
and take them to Su.

602
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,149
What price should I ask?

603
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,580
Do not charge him.

604
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,500
Tell them it's a loan from me.

605
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,180
A token of goodwill.

606
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:56,109
Your foot is in this condition

607
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,620
and you didn't tell me?

608
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,340
You're not fine. Let me take a look.

609
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:05,060
Come here. Let me have a look at it.
Show me that foot.

610
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,660
Let me see it.

611
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,749
That wound could be infected,

612
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,340
and you're worried about your shoes?

613
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:16,220
Good thing I brought herbs.

614
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,900
This is hairy agrimony.

615
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,380
Anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving.

616
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,780
Grind it up

617
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,220
and apply it.

618
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,500
Here.

619
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,340
You know how to use it, right?

620
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,740
It's a mess.

621
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,460
We will have

622
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,420
to camp here overnight.

623
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,580
This calls for some litchi brew.

624
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,140
Give Li a cup too.

625
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,420
Li.

626
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,100
Just drink it.

627
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,340
Do it.

628
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,580
Thank you

629
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,989
for helping me

630
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,580
map the route today.

631
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,709
And to Li,

632
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,500
for all your services.

633
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,349
Let me toast you both.

634
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,580
Mr. Li.

635
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,820
Mr. Li,

636
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,180
you treat Li very well.

637
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:43,300
And he works hard for me.

638
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,149
He's not a slave.

639
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,700
He's a friend.

640
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,060
Mr. Li.

641
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,700
I know you're a good man.

642
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,260
It's not that I don't want to help you.

643
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,540
I simply can't risk

644
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,980
exposing my identity.

645
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,940
I've been in hiding all these years.

646
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,860
I haven't even returned home once.

647
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,180
I understand.

648
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,340
Tong told me

649
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,460
about your past.

650
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,780
I understand.

651
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,669
Everyone has their own secrets

652
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,900
and burdens.

653
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:25,869
You must have had your reasons

654
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,420
for becoming a deserter.

655
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,140
Mr. Li.

656
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,060
I'm not a deserter.

657
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,860
I was framed.

658
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,420
Back then,

659
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,420
we were on naval patrol

660
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,420
when we spotted a group of pirates

661
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,660
hijacking a ship transporting herbs.

662
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,789
I shot an arrow

663
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,780
and hit the pirate captain,

664
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,220
forcing him to the stern.

665
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,260
But their reinforcements arrived.

666
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,980
We were outnumbered,

667
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,860
and had no choice but to jump ship.

668
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:01,460
I was rescued by fishermen.

669
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,300
By the time I recovered

670
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,820
and returned to Lingnan,

671
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,389
we had all been listed

672
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,060
as military deserters.

673
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,900
Is it possible

674
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,820
that it was just a misunderstanding
because you had been gone too long?

675
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,820
That's what

676
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,309
we thought at first too.

677
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:22,700
But when one of our men
tried to explain to the authorities,

678
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,140
he was executed under military law.

679
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,980
After that, the rest of us knew

680
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,500
going back meant certain death.

681
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,700
Mr. Li.

682
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,220
You are new to Lingnan.

683
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,509
You don't know the rules here.

684
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,060
Here, the officials and bandits

685
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,940
are often in collusion.

686
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,500
When trouble happens,

687
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,260
it's always us little people
who take the fall.

688
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:52,180
It's a pity, given all your skills.

689
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,060
My skills are not worth mentioning.

690
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,429
You should have seen

691
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,829
my fellow soldiers.

692
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,189
They were the real experts.

693
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,380
Really?

694
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,309
Archery, horseback, sailing,
they could do it all.

695
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,900
They charged into battle without fear.

696
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,580
All they wanted was to return home

697
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,620
in glory one day.

698
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,340
But now?

699
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,780
We're all separated,

700
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:21,140
scattered, hiding.

701
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,340
Freedom may never come again.

702
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,780
Don't be so pessimistic.

703
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,540
We make our own destiny.

704
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,220
You're still better off than me.

705
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:38,620
I'm the one clinging to life
in a hopeless situation.

706
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,660
You will

707
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,860
find your way again.

708
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:42,940
Mr. Li.

709
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,820
Have a seat.

710
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,860
These past few days,

711
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,740
I've been thinking about what you said.

712
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:00,420
You need adept riders for your trial.

713
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,669
My fellow soldiers

714
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,300
are the experts you need.

715
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,740
So,

716
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,980
could use your status as the Litchi Envoy

717
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,660
to help clear our names

718
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,260
and obtain a pardon for us?

719
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,940
If...

720
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,300
I mean, if.

721
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,900
If you manage to pull it off,

722
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,420
we will help you with all we have.

723
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,540
Even if it means risking our lives

724
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,460
and everything we have.

725
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,180
Really?

726
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,380
Yes.

727
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,020
Mr. Li...

728
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,100
I...

729
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,260
Please get up, Mr. Li.
I can't accept this.

730
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,940
Thank you.

731
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,940
But...

732
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:58,340
I can certainly try to apply for a pardon

733
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,300
on your behalf.

734
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,700
If it succeeds, that would be wonderful.

735
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:05,940
But if it fails,

736
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,269
you might not even be able

737
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,620
to stay in this garden.

738
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,860
Mr. Li.

739
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,260
I have been on the run for years.

740
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,700
I know how slim the chances are.

741
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,460
No matter the outcome,

742
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,260
I'm ready to accept it.

743
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,980
Your willingness to try

744
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,220
is already more than I could ask for.

745
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,660
Mr. Li.

746
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,620
I have a piece of evidence.

747
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:42,620
I seized this from
the pirate captain that day.

748
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,420
Keep it with you for now.

749
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,220
I will give it a try.

750
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,060
You really are something.

751
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,500
You want to appeal to Inspector He?

752
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,349
Do you even know
that he used to be a pirate?

753
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,660
What if he is in league with those pirates,

754
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,860
and ends up arresting those people?

755
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,900
Was your little overnight disappearance
just you digging your own grave?

756
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,980
I just thought I'd do what I can to help.

757
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:23,100
Yan really is a skilled rider.

758
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:26,349
And more importantly,
he came to me willingly.

759
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:29,709
The man is trusting me with his life,
so I figured I should at least give it a try.

760
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,140
You figured you'd try?

761
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,860
You figured you'd try?

762
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,709
Of all the paths in this world,

763
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,500
you had to pick the hardest one.

764
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,989
Is it easier to pardon a deserter,

765
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,749
or to find a good rider?

766
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,069
It's not just one rider.

767
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,060
It's a whole team of riders.

768
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,549
Yan said

769
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,229
he has several brothers-in-arms.

770
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,460
All of them are expert horsemen.

771
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,420
Well, I'm warning you now.

772
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,349
When you see Inspector He,
do not mention that you've seen this man,

773
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:59,260
and do not bring up that dagger.

774
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,589
We'll test the waters first.

775
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,640
See what kind of attitude he has
toward this matter before we decide what to do.

776
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,540
You're right.

777
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:08,029
I can't expose Yan just yet.

778
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,820
We'll give it a test first.

779
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,180
Take it step by step.

780
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,980
Since we are already talking about this,
I will help you one more time.

781
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,820
I'll give you a little extra push.

782
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,220
You?

783
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,340
Was it not me
who gave the horse situation a push?

784
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,140
Good news!

785
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,669
- Good news!
- Su.

786
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,180
- Su.
- Su.

787
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,840
Good evening.

788
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,140
Sit down and tell us.

789
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,900
What is this great news?

790
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,500
Guess what?

791
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:56,749
With my silver tongue,

792
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,580
I managed to talk Hu merchant Hadi

793
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,460
into giving us some fine horses.

794
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:01,869
Really?

795
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,220
Absolutely.

796
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,109
Told you my "little push" would work,
didn't I?

797
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,340
This man has done it!

798
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,220
Six horses?

799
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:10,509
Six horses.

800
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,740
Six.

801
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,029
You only needed six,

802
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,380
and now you got exactly what you wanted?

803
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,149
I only need six for now.

804
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,820
We have six horses.

805
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,460
That is wonderful!

806
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,749
Please help me choose

807
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,940
the six best ones.

808
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:26,829
Of course.

809
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,709
Also,

810
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,029
Su,

811
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,669
can you help me find

812
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,700
some experienced riders?

813
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:35,989
How many "horses" do you need?

814
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,180
How many people.

815
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,020
Riders.

816
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:40,749
Right. How many riders?

817
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:41,980
The more, the better.

818
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:46,460
Finding good riders

819
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,509
in Lingnan may not be easy.

820
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,540
True. Here's what we'll do.

821
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:54,549
I will look on my end as well.

822
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,109
We will prepare on both sides.

823
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:58,660
Excellent.

824
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,540
Rest assured, Envoy Li.

825
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:04,460
I will give it everything I have.

826
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,220
Like a baby sucking milk.

827
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:10,780
I await good news.

828
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,469
Thank you, Su.

829
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,189
Gou'er, bring a basin.

830
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,580
Soak your feet too.

831
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,580
Bring a clean one.

832
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,909
You are being too kind.

833
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,580
Not at all.

834
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,669
It relieves fatigue.

835
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,860
Indeed.

836
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,869
Where I come from,

837
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,140
we just strip down and soak in the sea.

838
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,650
We don't have to do that in Chang'an.

839
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,829
That's true.

840
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:37,869
=The Litchi Road=

841
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:39,970
What is it that you actually want?

842
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:42,189
Let's make a deal.

843
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,380
So,

844
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:47,380
you two already talked this over?

845
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,940
I must ask him in person

846
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:54,660
who betrayed my father.

847
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:56,860
You are a professional rider?

848
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:59,260
I run a cockfighting arena.

849
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:02,220
That's crossing into another field.

850
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,549
This is great!

851
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,740
