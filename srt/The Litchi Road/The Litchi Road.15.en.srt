00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,999
=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,980
(Osmanthus of the Old Mansion: Two)

3
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,900
(February of the 13th year of Tianbao,
Chang'an)

4
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,520
Father, when will you

5
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,066
take me to see the old mansion?

6
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,120
I've been busy

7
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,430
with work lately.

8
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,030
I'll give you the key.

9
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,150
Later,

10
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,755
pass it on to your uncle.

11
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,430
When he's back,

12
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,622
have him take you there.

13
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,240
Here you go.

14
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,990
When will Uncle be back?

15
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Maybe in three to five days.

16
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,030
What if he doesn't come back?

17
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,280
Why not?

18
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,840
Just like you,

19
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,910
he was born and raised in Chang'an.

20
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,400
Chang'an is his home.

21
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,040
If he can't make it back...

22
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,711
If he can't make it back...

23
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,240
Ouch!

24
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,080
Are you all right?

25
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,520
The breakfast you made is really salty.

26
00:04:02,177 --> 00:04:03,430
I didn't use that much salt.

27
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,555
I added a lot of vinegar.

28
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,750
Father,

29
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,360
I wasn't eating slowly on purpose.

30
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,190
It really didn't taste good.

31
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,750
I didn't blame you.

32
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,910
I just think

33
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,711
you should learn to tie your hair.

34
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,800
I can. I'm just slow.

35
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,190
Father, slow down a bit.

36
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,310
Slow down?

37
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,000
You walk faster.

38
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,680
I have to report for duty,

39
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,920
and there's a lot of other work.

40
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,977
I'm running out of time.

41
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,070
Then why did you ask me

42
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,070
to tie my hair just now?

43
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,430
Now my hair looks bad,

44
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:30,040
and you're mad that you're running late.

45
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:31,000
I just think

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,466
everything has to start somewhere.

47
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,680
When I leave

48
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,040
for work later,

49
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,870
you'll have to

50
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,555
sweep, do your laundry, and cook
all by yourself, right?

51
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,000
You're hurting me.

52
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,720
I can go to school by myself.

53
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,070
You can?

54
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,800
I know the way.

55
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,466
Didn't you say everything has to
start somewhere?

56
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,190
Aren't you already late for duty?

57
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,560
Did you see

58
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,870
a girl this tall?

59
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,270
I don't understand.

60
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,040
Did you see

61
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,270
a girl this tall?

62
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,160
She was walking alone.

63
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,720
Is your child missing?

64
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,600
Xiu'er.

65
00:06:17,888 --> 00:06:19,290
What happened? Why are you anxious?

66
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,600
What happened, Shande?

67
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,377
What's going on?

68
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,040
Did you see Xiu'er come back?

69
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:23,830
No.

70
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,670
She's gone missing?

71
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,720
Where's Xiu'er?

72
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,800
I looked away, and she disappeared.

73
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,800
- Look for her.
- Let's go.

74
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,360
Yes, right.

75
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,200
Xiu'er!

76
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,030
Xiu'er!

77
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,750
You scared me.

78
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,190
Why did you come here?

79
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,680
You had me so scared.

80
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,390
I thought someone took you.

81
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,822
I was looking for you everywhere.

82
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,470
You really scared me.

83
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,000
Father,

84
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,120
while I was walking,

85
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,088
I thought of you leaving me all alone

86
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,040
in Chang'an for work,
I suddenly felt so lonely.

87
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,830
So I thought if I came
to the old mansion,

88
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,422
Mother would be here for me.

89
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,440
Father,

90
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,244
you're not mad at me, are you?

91
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,400
No, I'm not.

92
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,120
I'm not mad at you.

93
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,960
Why would I be mad?

94
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll be back

95
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,950
after the work is done.

96
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,911
I'll be back soon.

97
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,920
Xiu'er, you're a big girl now.

98
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,750
You can take care of yourself.

99
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,400
That's right.

100
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,177
I'm a big girl now.

101
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,733
I can take care of myself.

102
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,070
Can I come here often?

103
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,670
Of course.

104
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,160
Whenever you want.

105
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,000
This is our home,

106
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,840
isn't it?

107
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,155
Whenever you want to come,

108
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,111
ask the Alley Master to bring you.

109
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,240
This is the house

110
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,044
your mother and I used to live in.

111
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,000
Look.

112
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,120
Your mother planted

113
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,630
this osmanthus tree.

114
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,200
It was her favorite.

115
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,377
Father, when will you come home?

116
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,390
When the osmanthus tree blooms,

117
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,870
I'll be back.

118
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,510
That's great.

119
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,822
Then, I'll water it every day

120
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,422
so it'll bloom sooner.

121
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,380
=Episode 15=

122
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,200
Move out!

123
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,220
Yes!

124
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,080
Chief Scribe Zhao,

125
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,870
what's wrong with Lan?

126
00:09:13,244 --> 00:09:14,790
I told him to disrupt the formation,

127
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,666
not to stir them up.

128
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,840
Didn't you arrange everything?

129
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,680
What's going on now?

130
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,800
He did it on purpose.

131
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,480
He has to put on a show for Li Shande

132
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,720
at the beginning.

133
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,755
Su, you're here
for the court assembly too.

134
00:09:55,955 --> 00:09:57,733
Did you bring some good business here?

135
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,510
Today,

136
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,000
I only bring my two ears.

137
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,240
Alateng Guxi,

138
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,080
my friend.

139
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,030
Greetings, Mr. Su.

140
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,960
You're the record-keeper today?

141
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,320
As before,

142
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,550
if there's anything useful,

143
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,870
I'll write it down word for word.

144
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,870
Very well.

145
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,590
Gentlemen,

146
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:23,160
Ms. Amita is here.

147
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,200
Greetings.

148
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,022
Please be seated.

149
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,777
Greetings, everyone.

150
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,840
I'm here to ask for some water.

151
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,120
May I?

152
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,960
Guiyun,

153
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,720
we're holding a court assembly today.

154
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,840
May I ask what brings you here?

155
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:59,311
A thriving economy brings fortune and
harmony to the nation and its people.

156
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:01,733
This is what Right Chancellor
hopes for.

157
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,870
I came here to seek counsel.

158
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,720
If there were ever a venture

159
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,390
that could benefit the Tang as well

160
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,790
and yield rich rewards,

161
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,600
wouldn't that be wonderful?

162
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:16,960
It would also make
my inspection mission to Lingnan

163
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,000
worthwhile.

164
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,440
If that is so,

165
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,488
please be seated.

166
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,240
Leaders of the association,

167
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,750
the Lingnan Court Assembly

168
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,440
is an important event for us.

169
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,910
Last year,

170
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,670
we opened

171
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,720
a new trade route,

172
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,670
raising profits by twenty percent

173
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,888
from the previous year.

174
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,266
Especially the new trade-in Tazi,

175
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,840
where we exchanged silk and china

176
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,270
for rhino horn, ivory,

177
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,600
spices, and fabrics.

178
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,960
One caravan alone

179
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,600
brought in thirty percent
of the year's profit.

180
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,510
This year,

181
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,844
if anyone sees a new,
promising opportunity,

182
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,910
propose it.

183
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,230
House rule.

184
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,320
Whoever proposes the business

185
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,790
shall lead it.

186
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:24,200
If the proposal is approved,

187
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,866
everyone invests,
and we profit together.

188
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,320
Aye, aye!

189
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,200
Why are they handing out sweets first?

190
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,560
They're not sweets.

191
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:41,870
It's the usual practice
at the court assembly.

192
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,870
Everyone receives two pieces of ox bone.

193
00:12:44,044 --> 00:12:45,480
They look the same on the outside,

194
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,870
but one is hollow,

195
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,910
and the other is solid.

196
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,240
Only the person holding it

197
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,080
can tell.

198
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,030
Solid means agree,

199
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,670
and hollow means disagree.

200
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,360
Then, each person drops the one

201
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,840
that reflects their vote

202
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,910
into the box

203
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,120
and the other

204
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,266
into a second box.

205
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,630
I see.

206
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,480
So no one knows

207
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,390
who agrees

208
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,440
or disagrees.

209
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,390
Interesting.

210
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,480
Of course.

211
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,840
It was Ms. Amita's idea.

212
00:13:09,777 --> 00:13:11,466
Now the ox bones have been distributed,

213
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,390
so let the court assembly begin.

214
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,840
Hollow.

215
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,110
Hollow.

216
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,666
Ms. Amita, the proposal wasn't approved.

217
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:14,111
I've been sitting here
watching this whole time.

218
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,390
None of the proposals

219
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,720
has been accepted.

220
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:18,622
Right Chancellor has given us

221
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:19,666
every advantage,

222
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,711
yet everyone is still so cautious.

223
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,333
How can the association progress?

224
00:14:23,377 --> 00:14:24,933
If Right Chancellor heard this,

225
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,670
he would surely be worried.

226
00:14:27,177 --> 00:14:29,311
Good business opportunities
are always out there.

227
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,720
All it takes is a keen eye to discover

228
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,733
and a bold spirit to act on them.

229
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,630
I have a suggestion.

230
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,440
Since we opened

231
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,510
the trade route with Tazi last year,

232
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,440
why not

233
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,600
expand it further?

234
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,440
Now, the Tang's china, tea leaves,

235
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,550
silk, and paper

236
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,440
are in high demand in Tazi.

237
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,000
This way, we could bring back

238
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,630
more ivory, rhino horn, and spices

239
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,720
to further expand our business

240
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,200
and break last year's profit record.

241
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,350
Brilliant!

242
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,320
Break the record.

243
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,150
It sounds like a good idea.

244
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,480
Let's all stop voting

245
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,480
with hollow bones.

246
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,150
Last year, when Ms. Amita proposed

247
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,790
the business route to Tazi,

248
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,750
none of us approved of it.

249
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,600
If not

250
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,360
for her sharp judgment
and decisive call,

251
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,510
how would we

252
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,840
have today's abundant profits?

253
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,870
Since Ms. Amita

254
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,670
has faith in this project,

255
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,840
let's vote.

256
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,560
Faqi.

257
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,080
Take out your abacus

258
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,088
and do the math.

259
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,320
Tell me,

260
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,360
when you traveled alone

261
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,120
across the sea and back,

262
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,600
how much profit did you make each year?

263
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,150
You said Ms. Amita has sharp judgment.

264
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,510
That's true.

265
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,670
These past years,

266
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,270
our business has been thriving,

267
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,440
but the money

268
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,480
actually going into our pockets,
has it increased

269
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,750
or decreased?

270
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,550
Based on what you've said,

271
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,790
business is booming,

272
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,630
but the money

273
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,000
has become less.

274
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,390
You said that on purpose.

275
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,720
I have a feeling you're a traitor.

276
00:16:23,977 --> 00:16:27,222
You bite the hand that feeds you and
turn your back on those who help you.

277
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,710
Mr. Ma,

278
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,555
how could I bite a feeding hand

279
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,440
if it never existed?

280
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,866
Who could I turn against

281
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,670
if no one ever helped me?

282
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,720
Mr. Ma, you may not be aware.

283
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,550
Pirates have been running amok
these years.

284
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,360
They constantly attack merchant ships.

285
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,630
Out of desperation,

286
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,200
we Hu merchants have no choice

287
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,960
but to pay with our own money

288
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,311
to ransom our ships and cargo.

289
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,790
Mr. Fan, your Yonghe Store
suffered losses

290
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,920
because of this.

291
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,080
Mr. Gu,

292
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,070
I believe that's when

293
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,155
you changed your line of business.

294
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,070
I'm not making baseless claims, am I?

295
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,350
All these profitable ventures
these years

296
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,400
came from my proposals.

297
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,200
And now you're stirring trouble here...

298
00:17:28,577 --> 00:17:30,044
What's your real intention?

299
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,350
Do you have

300
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,880
an even more profitable business

301
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,240
to share with us?

302
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,160
Of course I do.

303
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,000
As you all know,

304
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,720
the Litchi Envoy is currently running
a trial of litchi delivery

305
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,070
at the East Gate.

306
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,030
If you will lend a hand,

307
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,240
once it succeeds,

308
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,070
profits could exceed thirty percent.

309
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,160
Plus, litchi is an imperial tribute,

310
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,160
so there's no need to worry about

311
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,030
bandit attacks en route.

312
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,910
Mr. Su,

313
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,790
once something is said
at the court assembly

314
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,070
and recorded,

315
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,590
there's no taking it back.

316
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,680
No worries, Ms. Amita.

317
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,310
Heaven is my witness.

318
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,550
I would never go back on my word.

319
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,110
Please record it.

320
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,000
I ramble, so if you can't keep up,

321
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,310
mark it with a circle first.

322
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,150
Mr. Su,

323
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,844
why are you helping the Litchi Envoy?

324
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,640
It's not just the Litchi Envoy

325
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,960
I'm helping.

326
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,350
I want to help

327
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,110
everyone here as well.

328
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,080
Mr. Ma,

329
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,070
if fresh litchis

330
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,422
are delivered to Chang'an,

331
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,960
and Noble Consort
gets to taste them,

332
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,200
what will she say?

333
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
If Her Highness tastes

334
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,790
fresh litchis, she'll say,

335
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,720
"Delicious.

336
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,350
I want more.

337
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,790
Are there more?"

338
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,350
Yes, there are!

339
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,830
If Noble Consort wants more,

340
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,488
shouldn't we deliver more?

341
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,888
We'll have to deliver it every year.

342
00:19:09,911 --> 00:19:11,270
That means litchis from Gaozhou

343
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,000
will become a regular tribute.

344
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,480
An annual delivery.

345
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:16,190
Everyone, think about it.

346
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,955
What kind of business would that be?

347
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,880
Everlasting.

348
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,830
Once-in-a-lifetime.

349
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
Mr. Su, your brilliant idea

350
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,960
is commendable.

351
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,480
Even if we earn profit from this,

352
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,880
we're also sharing His Majesty's burden.

353
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,590
You flattered me, Mr. Ma.

354
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,830
If the Hu merchants fund it,

355
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:45,510
the litchi delivery trial may succeed.

356
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,160
Then if His Majesty asks about it,

357
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,311
and Litchi Envoy puts in
a few good words for us,

358
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,830
would any of you still worry

359
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,550
about losing out

360
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,590
on this opportunity?

361
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,110
When the time comes,

362
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,110
litchi procurement and horse supply

363
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,550
will all be in our control.

364
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,350
Maybe post stations along the route

365
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,480
would also be entrusted to us.

366
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,240
It's a gold mine.

367
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,000
Where else could you find

368
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,333
a deal this good?

369
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,160
I agree with Mr. Su.

370
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,270
This is indeed a promising deal.

371
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,790
Great minds think alike.

372
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,920
If it's such a good deal,

373
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,844
why don't you do it yourself?

374
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,070
Someone asked me

375
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,666
the same question before.

376
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,920
The association exists

377
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,030
so the Hu merchants
can support each other

378
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,511
and share profits fairly.

379
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,960
I'm simply following

380
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,830
the court assembly's rules

381
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,000
and sharing this business opportunity

382
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,640
with you all.

383
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,160
Faqi, if you have doubts,

384
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,680
I won't force you.

385
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,933
You're free to vote with a hollow bone.

386
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:04,600
Mr. Su is a seasoned businessman.

387
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,830
He already knows

388
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,400
where the risks lie.

389
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,560
In the end,

390
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,750
this whole project hinges on

391
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,070
whether fresh litchis

392
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,088
can be delivered to Chang'an in time.

393
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,960
Our proposal differs only

394
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,790
in profit margin, not in scale.

395
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,240
However,

396
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,310
this is a gamble.

397
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,888
Delivering fresh litchis is impossible.

398
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,550
If it fails,

399
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,240
all early investments

400
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,790
will go down the drain.

401
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,590
You're right, Ms. Amita.

402
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,933
There's risk.

403
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,590
That's exactly why

404
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,350
Mr. Li has worked

405
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,160
tirelessly,

406
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,350
day and night,

407
00:21:49,644 --> 00:21:51,022
running countless trials.

408
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,550
What I want to say is,

409
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,350
if you could

410
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,720
be a little more patient

411
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,880
and wait for a few more days

412
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,110
for Mr. Li's results

413
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,550
before making the decision,

414
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,822
wouldn't that be wiser?

415
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,510
Why do I get the feeling

416
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,955
this court assembly is about to end?

417
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,160
That won't do, right?

418
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,550
I haven't finished yet.

419
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,550
After several attempts,

420
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,590
Mr. Li has extended

421
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,310
the preservation period from three days

422
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,711
to seven!

423
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,240
- Seven days?
- Seven days?

424
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,310
I saw it with my own eyes.

425
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,310
The trial at the East Gate

426
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,070
is meant to shorten the transport time

427
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,240
as much as possible.

428
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,030
Once it succeeds,

429
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,030
fresh litchi delivery to Chang'an

430
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,911
won't be impossible anymore.

431
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,400
What do you say, guys?

432
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,480
I'll say something.

433
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,680
This litchi delivery mission

434
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,550
is Right Chancellor's idea.

435
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,110
If you can show your support,

436
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,600
the budget will be increased.

437
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,350
I'll bear witness here.

438
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,960
If it succeeds,

439
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,480
your loyalty to the imperial court

440
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,866
won't be let down.

441
00:23:30,613 --> 00:23:31,640
Ms. Amita has a point.

442
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,510
After all, you're putting in real money.

443
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:38,000
It's good to be cautious.

444
00:23:38,888 --> 00:23:40,480
Since we're holding this court assembly

445
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,000
to make money

446
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,640
and seek good ventures,

447
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,240
what harm is there

448
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,888
in waiting a few days?

449
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,400
As the saying goes,
"Patience is a dish best-served cold.

450
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,311
A good match is worth waiting for."

451
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,070
In that case,

452
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,110
let's vote with ox bones

453
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,911
to decide whether we should postpone
the court assembly.

454
00:24:09,066 --> 00:24:10,070
That's too much trouble.

455
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,480
If you agree, clap.

456
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,520
If not,

457
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,590
stomp your feet,

458
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,240
Clap if you agree. Agree.

459
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,840
Very much agree.

460
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,560
Agree.

461
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,480
Since everyone wants

462
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,488
to let this stray arrow fly
a little longer,

463
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,350
the court assembly is postponed.

464
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,310
Until Mr. Li's trials conclude,

465
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,670
we'll discuss it again.

466
00:25:04,357 --> 00:25:06,597
Well done, Mr. Su!

467
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,020
- Excellent!
- Good!

468
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,510
Excellent!

469
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,000
- Good!
- Very well!

470
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,790
- Good!
- Excellent!

471
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,400
Mr. Li,

472
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,030
can you make them turn red?

473
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,720
If you want litchis,

474
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,920
there are plenty in the basin.

475
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,977
But the head won't let me eat them.

476
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,110
How about this?

477
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,830
Take a jar

478
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,222
and put them inside.

479
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,560
Then,

480
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,880
add this fruit.

481
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,839
Seal the jar for a day,
and they'll ripen.

482
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,133
Remember, don't seal them
for too long, or they'll rot.

483
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,550
This is my secret.

484
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,390
Don't tell anyone.

485
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,840
He heard us.

486
00:26:13,711 --> 00:26:14,760
He's not an outsider.

487
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,750
I don't tell a soul.

488
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,000
Like this?

489
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,680
Why are you back so soon?

490
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,955
Inspector He saw everything!

491
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,040
Yes.

492
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,510
He was showing off

493
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,070
at the cockfighting ring, that's fine.

494
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,240
Good job, Lan.

495
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,920
Thank you.

496
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,720
Here. Give it to me.

497
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,560
Good job.

498
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,110
All right. Get back to your work.

499
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,950
Sure.

500
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,200
Now he's making us ride horses,

501
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,044
yet belittles us
with his airs and graces.

502
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,720
I'll show him

503
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,666
the Shadowless lives up to its name
for a reason.

504
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,960
Right.

505
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,790
Understood, Lan.

506
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,244
I'm just worried
that he will cause us trouble.

507
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,533
What he truly cares about
is in our cage.

508
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,377
He can't do anything to us.

509
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,480
What did you say?

510
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,220
The court assembly was suspended?

511
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,790
Su Liang stirred things up,

512
00:27:14,888 --> 00:27:16,160
encouraging everyone to vote

513
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,888
for Li Shande's litchi delivery project.

514
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,888
He even promised thirty percent profit.

515
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,440
Ma Guiyun intended to do the deal
for Right Chancellor,

516
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,400
so he chipped in.

517
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,640
The wind shifted.

518
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,000
Those Hu merchants all voted

519
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,110
to suspend the session.

520
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,440
I had no choice

521
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,800
but to give them that courtesy.

522
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,590
Lingnan has been peaceful for years.

523
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,310
A little wind stirs,

524
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,750
and everyone wavers.

525
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,750
Leave this to me.

526
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,030
I'll let

527
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,110
those smarty-pants know

528
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,750
it's not easy

529
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,511
to forge their own path.

530
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,640
It's more secure

531
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,480
to follow me.

532
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,740
(The Second Day of the Trial)

533
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,400
The horses are here!

534
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,790
- The horses are here!
- The horses are here!

535
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,480
- The horses are here!
- The horses are here!

536
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,000
The horses are here!

537
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,880
- The horses are here!

538
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,390
The horses are back!

539
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,000
- The horses are back!
- The horses are back!

540
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,960
The horses are back!

541
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,870
The horses are back!

542
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,160
Quick.

543
00:29:07,422 --> 00:29:08,220
The horses are back!

544
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,000
Quick.

545
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,950
How did it go?

546
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,510
Jar A has no...

547
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,480
No problem.

548
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,920
Yes, no problem.

549
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,400
Jar B is fine too.

550
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,830
Jar C is all right.

551
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,540
(The Third Day of the Trial)

552
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:52,420
(Inspector's Office)

553
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,860
(Liu's Coconut Juice)

554
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,350
Apologise, I'm late.

555
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:02,444
Why is Inspector He holding a feast
on such short notice?

556
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,350
I think

557
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,480
it's because we voted

558
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,790
to suspend the court assembly.

559
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,720
Sirs,

560
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,510
how should we explain

561
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,240
to Inspector He?

562
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,440
As the Tang people say,

563
00:30:20,755 --> 00:30:23,933
"Confront the enemy with generals.
Block the flood with the earth."

564
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,830
We'll take things as they come.
No worries.

565
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,110
It's getting late.

566
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,510
Let's head in.

567
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,155
Everyone, make yourselves at home.

568
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,280
These past years,

569
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,550
you've gone through ups and downs

570
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,480
and contributed greatly

571
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,288
to Gaozhou's tax revenue.

572
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,720
As the inspector,

573
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,750
I shall thank you.

574
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,320
Raise your cups.

575
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,040
Let's drink.

576
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,310
Paying taxes is our duty.

577
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,466
Please don't say that, Inspector He.

578
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,070
Helping Gaozhou's tax revenues

579
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,240
is our responsibility.

580
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,480
For the development of Gaozhou,

581
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,310
it's worth the effort.

582
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,750
Well said.

583
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,960
Today is a family banquet.

584
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,400
Well,

585
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,440
I invited you all

586
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,680
as the godfather of Amita.

587
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,200
The Hu Merchants' Association

588
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,480
flourished

589
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,777
thanks to your support.

590
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:47,440
Amita is very young.

591
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,480
Without your tolerance

592
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,960
and help,

593
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,590
she could never have succeeded.

594
00:31:54,711 --> 00:31:55,840
I offer this second toast

595
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,030
as her godfather. I thank you all.

596
00:31:58,733 --> 00:31:59,688
We've not done enough.

597
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,070
Inspector He, you're too kind.

598
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:01,910
Cheers.

599
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,240
Recently, I heard

600
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,720
the court assembly

601
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,270
was abruptly suspended.

602
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,270
It seems like Su Liang

603
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,510
made a proposal.

604
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,720
Is that true?

605
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,150
His Majesty

606
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,400
likes our litchis,

607
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,110
that's a good thing.

608
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,350
This is both a blessing
and an opportunity

609
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,720
for people in Gaozhou.

610
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,240
Am I right, Zhao?

611
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,800
Exactly.

612
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,880
In fact,

613
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,240
Inspector He has always held
high hopes for this.

614
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,270
Since the Litchi Envoy

615
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,310
arrived in Gaozhou,

616
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,044
he has been granted every convenience.

617
00:32:56,688 --> 00:32:57,920
But unexpectedly, this fellow

618
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,880
is two-faced and insincere.

619
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,310
Since arriving,

620
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,510
he's used his title

621
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,400
to swindle money.

622
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,640
But why did he rally the people

623
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,880
and stage this delivery trial here?

624
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,640
If he didn't run this trial,

625
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,622
would you have the confidence
to fund him?

626
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,510
This isn't a trial. It's a performance.

627
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,480
(He's pretending)

628
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,000
(as if he's dedicated,)

629
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,110
(just to put on a show for you.)

630
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,110
The horses are back!

631
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,110
(When Li Shande)

632
00:33:40,355 --> 00:33:42,066
(requested to use the Little East Gate)

633
00:33:42,066 --> 00:33:43,160
(for his trial,)

634
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,310
(I warned him)

635
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,350
(the trial)

636
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,270
(wouldn't lead him anywhere.)

637
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,750
(How could it compare to)

638
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,155
(delivery all the way to Chang'an?)

639
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,480
(It's like blindfolding)

640
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,110
(a donkey and making it
walk around the millstone)

641
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,030
(a thousand times...)

642
00:33:57,288 --> 00:33:59,110
It'll never become
a thousand-mile-steed!

643
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,560
Carry him to the well
to get some cold water.

644
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,333
Add mint leaves.

645
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:04,560
All right. I'll do it.

646
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,680
Next rider.

647
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,520
Who's the next rider?

648
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,350
It's me.

649
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,488
Hurry up and mount now.

650
00:34:09,044 --> 00:34:11,022
- Mint leaves! Hurry up!
- Be careful.

651
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,840
(Shen Hour, You Hour)
(This is a childish trial.)

652
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,510
Even if it succeeds,

653
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,510
what does it prove?

654
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,320
But this time, it's different.

655
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,000
He's reaching into

656
00:34:23,022 --> 00:34:24,280
the Hu Merchants' Association,

657
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,480
trying to move against the members

658
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,000
and my family.

659
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,400
I won't tolerate that.

660
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,670
Now I'm truly upset.

661
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,400
Even if we take a generous view,

662
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,960
let's say the trial works out,

663
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,030
so what?

664
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,911
Once he reaches Chang'an
and meets His Majesty,

665
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:46,230
will he really mention all your names

666
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,755
and give away the credit?

667
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,110
The like of him, you know what,

668
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,920
once they rise to the top,

669
00:34:53,155 --> 00:34:54,710
they definitely will turn against you.

670
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,360
And when that happens,

671
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,760
you'll lose everything.

672
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,840
That's right.

673
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,160
Usually,

674
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,840
if your business fails,

675
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,280
at least the goods are in your hands.

676
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,760
You won't lose it all.

677
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,110
But the litchi delivery

678
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,360
is totally an impracticable project.

679
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,480
If it goes south,

680
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,760
you'll lose everything.

681
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,840
There'll be no turning back at all.

682
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,760
Zhao, don't scare them.

683
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:31,320
None of you have joined in yet, right?

684
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,550
Actually, it's simple.

685
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,320
When businessmen

686
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,670
see an opportunity,

687
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,710
they become thrilled.

688
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,320
I've come up with a plan for you.

689
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,440
We'll expand the route

690
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,840
to Tazi next year.

691
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,590
I promise your profit

692
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,320
will increase by thirty percent.

693
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,444
It's thirty percent after tax.

694
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,880
That's lucrative.

695
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:03,070
Do you mean it, Inspector He?

696
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,800
Inspector He made this promise
right in front of you,

697
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,620
how could it be false?

698
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
Gaozhou is thriving today,

699
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,133
thanks to your support.

700
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:15,333
It's not easy to meet each other
across the sea.

701
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,710
Inspector He held this banquet

702
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,960
to give everyone

703
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,230
this opportunity.

704
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,510
We can collaborate

705
00:36:20,622 --> 00:36:21,760
and brave obstacles as one.

706
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,360
That's enough.

707
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,666
Stop giving a lofty speech.

708
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,840
It's simple.

709
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,480
When there's an opportunity,
we seize it together.

710
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,030
When there's profit,
we earn it together.

711
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,030
Anyway, as long as you're happy,

712
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,590
I'm happy too.

713
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,190
Inspector He, thank you

714
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,550
for looking out for us.

715
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,511
On behalf of the Hu merchants...

716
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,510
I... I invite our elder,

717
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,800
Mr. Gu, to offer a toast.

718
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,160
Mr. Gu.

719
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,360
Inspector He, you've devoted yourself to

720
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,880
steering our course.

721
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,960
I believe the Hu merchants

722
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,177
will stay on the right path.

723
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,110
Come, let's raise our cups
to Inspector He

724
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,800
for leading us through the storm

725
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,210
and bringing us a bountiful harvest.

726
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,120
Well said!

727
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:22,870
Cheers.

728
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,190
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

729
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,800
Be careful.

730
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:27,910
Bring more water.

731
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,400
Mr. Li.

732
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,400
One of the litchis has split.

733
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,550
This one was crushed.

734
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,840
It's not spoiled.

735
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,360
They're transported by horses.

736
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,760
Damage is unavoidable.

737
00:37:53,044 --> 00:37:54,280
Wrap them in something soft.

738
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:55,920
Wrap them up.

739
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,670
Get cloth. Cloth.

740
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,590
No, not cloth.

741
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,440
It doesn't breathe. Use paper.

742
00:38:00,466 --> 00:38:01,470
There's paper over there.

743
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,440
Here.

744
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,280
Come on.

745
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,155
How is he?

746
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:10,320
He's feeling better now.

747
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,800
What a relief.

748
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,720
Mr. Li,

749
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,920
the heat is blazing.

750
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,360
None of us can stand it.

751
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,355
Luckily, he collapsed here.

752
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,670
If it happened on the mountain road,

753
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,960
he could've fallen off the horse.

754
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,066
And if the horse ran off,

755
00:38:33,066 --> 00:38:34,488
how would we continue this trial?

756
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,680
Mr. Li,

757
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,088
we can tough it out.

758
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,577
You're pushing yourselves too hard!

759
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,230
Even if you can hold out,

760
00:38:49,311 --> 00:38:50,240
what about the horses?

761
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,070
They can't.

762
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,630
Those two strong horses

763
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,760
may handle another half-day journey,

764
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,630
but they can't last for more.

765
00:38:58,733 --> 00:39:00,311
Then, let's finish the half-day journey.

766
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,670
What difference

767
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,590
will it make?

768
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,510
If shouting louder wins the argument,

769
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,488
we might as well listen to donkeys.

770
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:07,880
Why are you shouting?

771
00:39:08,844 --> 00:39:11,044
We listen to Mr. Li
when it comes to the trial.

772
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:16,950
Well.

773
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,430
Mr. Lan,

774
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,110
I don't know you before,

775
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,360
but since everyone
respectfully calls you Mr. Lan,

776
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,200
I'll do the same.

777
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,710
This trial

778
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,377
isn't just theory on paper.

779
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,230
The road to Chang'an is 2500 km,

780
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,960
and is full of obstacles

781
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,030
that you can't foresee.

782
00:39:34,466 --> 00:39:35,550
The purpose of the trial

783
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,000
is to discover problems

784
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,840
and avoid them.

785
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,800
If we were only testing for speed,

786
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,590
that'd be easy.

787
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,710
We could take the average
from the first three days

788
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,550
and calculate it.

789
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,888
But that's not the point.

790
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,150
Only when a trial

791
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,840
goes on long enough,

792
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,630
people fall, and jars break,

793
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,280
we include all kinds of problems

794
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,320
to get the results

795
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,630
that are meaningful.

796
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,280
Mr. Li...

797
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,155
As long as there's still one horse left,

798
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,390
I'll keep going.

799
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,190
We will too.

800
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,600
Same here.

801
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,960
I appreciate that.

802
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:18,630
It's not that I want to give up.

803
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,510
My two friends

804
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,550
have never ridden like this
without rest.

805
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,760
Let them withdraw.

806
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,240
I'll stay.

807
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,470
Thank you.

808
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,720
Now,

809
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:41,550
we're short on riders.

810
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,880
Let's adjust the plan. Riders and horses

811
00:40:44,911 --> 00:40:46,377
swap out every three rounds.

812
00:40:46,488 --> 00:40:48,444
At least everyone
gets a full night's rest.

813
00:40:48,888 --> 00:40:50,244
What do you all think?

814
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,350
Good.

815
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:53,870
Good.

816
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:12,990
Jar C.

817
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:15,300
(The Fifth Day of the Trial)

818
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,030
Jar C.

819
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,000
What's the condition in Jar C?

820
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,110
Mr. Li,

821
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,230
litchis in Jar C have no problem.

822
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,190
- Good.
- Well done.

823
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,550
Chief Scribe Zhao,

824
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,800
how's the trial going?

825
00:41:32,822 --> 00:41:34,320
Riders and horses are exhausted.

826
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,440
Some have withdrawn.

827
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,070
Only a few riders left.

828
00:41:37,311 --> 00:41:38,320
They're barely holding on.

829
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,844
What about the man I told you to watch?

830
00:41:40,955 --> 00:41:42,030
He's done the most laps.

831
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,070
He's done the most laps.

832
00:41:45,777 --> 00:41:47,511
Then he must be close to collapse.

833
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:48,920
If anything happens to him

834
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,710
in the mountains,

835
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,110
it wouldn't be surprising.

836
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:53,950
Coming through.

837
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,550
Make way.

838
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,430
You guys...

839
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,000
Mr. Li.

840
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:58,870
Go to the back hill

841
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,030
and lay the rope.

842
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,044
Don't let me keep you.

843
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,644
Target at Yan Yazhuang's horse.

844
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,644
Quick. The horse is approaching.

845
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,088
They're coming. Get ready.

846
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,820
=The Litchi Road=

847
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,280
His Majesty and Noble Consort

848
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,510
may soon taste fresh litchis.

849
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,711
It's as if the fruit
is already in their mouths.

850
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:41,870
Impressive, Bro...

851
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,880
You're outstanding.

852
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,760
Li Shande,

853
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,800
Jar B is leaking.

854
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:49,990
Leaking?

855
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,400
The trial fails?

856
00:42:53,444 --> 00:42:54,688
I want to live.

857
00:42:54,777 --> 00:42:55,666
Father!

858
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,177
I'm desperate to live!

859
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,000
I'll risk my life

860
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,840
to make this deal work.

861
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,400
I won't disappoint

862
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,800
