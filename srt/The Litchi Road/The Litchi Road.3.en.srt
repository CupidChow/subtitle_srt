1
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,999
=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,420
I didn't pick you up yesterday.

3
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,020
Don't be mad at me.

4
00:01:44,977 --> 00:01:47,333
(Coworkers' "Love")
Something happened at Leyou Garden.

5
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,940
Someone ruined His Majesty's

6
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,755
favorite peonies.

7
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,220
If His Majesty

8
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,470
blames us,

9
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,500
my colleagues

10
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,711
will all lose their heads.

11
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,500
They're terrified

12
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,110
and can only ask me for help.

13
00:02:03,644 --> 00:02:05,888
Why are you
the only one who can save them?

14
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,830
You saw me

15
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,220
tending to plants.

16
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,590
No one in Shanglin Office can rival me.

17
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,100
I'm the best

18
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,150
in Leyou Garden.

19
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,540
So

20
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,630
if I went to save the peonies,

21
00:02:18,688 --> 00:02:20,149
I couldn't come to pick you up.

22
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,220
If I don't save the peonies,

23
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,844
my colleagues will lose their heads.

24
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,380
Should I save them or not?

25
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,244
Did you save the peonies?

26
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,500
If I take action,

27
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,100
I can solve it easily.

28
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,470
You saved your colleagues.

29
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,470
They must be very grateful.

30
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,340
Of course.

31
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,150
I saved their lives.

32
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,111
They're especially grateful.

33
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,860
=Episode 3=

34
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,540
(March, 13th Year of Tianbao,
Lingnan, Gaozhou)

35
00:03:19,977 --> 00:03:21,288
Gou'er, do you feel hot?

36
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,940
Yes.

37
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,430
Why is it so hot?

38
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,820
Let's go buy a fan someday.

39
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,870
We haven't been here before.
It's so hot here.

40
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,630
Do you remember what I taught you?

41
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,470
Yes.

42
00:03:45,577 --> 00:03:46,620
What are you here for?

43
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,820
You slave.

44
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,070
You're blind.

45
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,870
Look who's here.

46
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,780
Why did you hit a servant?

47
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,660
Yes.

48
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,030
How dare you call others a slave?

49
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,150
How insolent.

50
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,266
Why are you standing there?

51
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,430
Hurry and lead the way.

52
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:03,980
Your Excellency.

53
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,820
This way, please.

54
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,140
(Zhao Xinmin,
Chief Scribe of Inspector's Office)

55
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,155
You're not eating it right.

56
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,140
Sugar cane can't be eaten directly.

57
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,266
You need to chew it and suck the juice.

58
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,580
Then, spit out the residue.

59
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,820
Judging from your temperament,

60
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,190
you must be Inspector He.

61
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,340
I dare not.

62
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,820
I'm Inspector He's chief scribe.

63
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,190
I'm Zhao Xin,
and my courtesy name is Xinmin.

64
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,750
May I ask who you are?

65
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,190
I'm Ma Guiyun.

66
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,020
Right Chancellor's subordinate.

67
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,190
You seem older.

68
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,260
Is it appropriate to call you Xinmin?

69
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,310
No.

70
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,820
I think it's very inappropriate.

71
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,070
You're Right Chancellor's favorite.

72
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,820
I'm just a minor official in Lingnan.

73
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,260
I should call you

74
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,870
Guiyun.

75
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,740
We can call each other whatever we want.

76
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,260
Before leaving,

77
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,940
Pan Bao gave me a token.

78
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,940
See

79
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:45,340
if you recognize it.

80
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,260
Xinmin, look carefully.

81
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,510
Look slowly.

82
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,340
Guiyun, don't blame me.

83
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,690
It's not that I don't believe you.

84
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,790
It's just that this jade can't speak.

85
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,230
I have an agreement with Pan Bao.

86
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,020
If he gave it away willingly,

87
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,120
he'll secretly chip off

88
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,900
a corner of the token

89
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,790
to prevent...

90
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,870
Guiyun, do you understand?

91
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,830
Yes.

92
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,990
You're really cautious.

93
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,790
Is the corner

94
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,700
chipped off?

95
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,500
Yes.

96
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,670
It's indeed chipped off.

97
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,230
It's genuine.

98
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,380
But why didn't Pan Bao

99
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,580
come back with you

100
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,820
and ask you

101
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,870
to come here?

102
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,580
Right Chancellor said

103
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,070
Inspector He's matter is a big deal.

104
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,133
No mistakes are allowed.

105
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,500
He gave me the token

106
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,380
and asked me to come to Lingnan

107
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,790
and meet Inspector He first.

108
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,920
I've never met Right Chancellor.

109
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,190
Meeting you today

110
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,230
is like meeting Right Chancellor.

111
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,630
Where's Pan Bao?

112
00:07:20,822 --> 00:07:22,666
Pan Bao
is of course with Right Chancellor.

113
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,790
He handed me the token

114
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,340
and let me bring it over.

115
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,580
Xinmin, don't you understand?

116
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,220
I see.

117
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,790
I've been foolish.

118
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,020
For such a big matter,

119
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,670
it would be good for both sides

120
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,088
to have someone to liaise with.

121
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,910
Well.

122
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,100
Did Right Chancellor

123
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,340
give you any other items

124
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,870
to bring over?

125
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,270
There's

126
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,340
indeed one thing.

127
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,460
Right Chancellor solemnly instructed me

128
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,260
to personally hand this item

129
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,750
over to Inspector He.

130
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,630
I must not hand it over to others.

131
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,470
Otherwise,

132
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,070
I didn't have to travel so far
to get here.

133
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,510
I see.

134
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,140
But Inspector He

135
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,790
went out patrolling

136
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,022
and hasn't come back yet.

137
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,630
Why don't you

138
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,740
rest for a few days

139
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,860
and let me

140
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,550
host you?

141
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,860
In that case,

142
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,422
Right Chancellor has one more thing

143
00:08:34,422 --> 00:08:35,466
that needs you

144
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,190
to report to Inspector He in advance.

145
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,980
I will obey Right Chancellor's orders.

146
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,620
Does he want gold and silver or...

147
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,550
South Sea treasures?

148
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,630
Neither.

149
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,430
It's a letter.

150
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,190
If Inspector He could personally

151
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,866
write a letter of allegiance

152
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,220
to Right Chancellor,

153
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,510
we'll have no doubts

154
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,350
about each other

155
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,460
and cooperate sincerely.

156
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,150
Is this letter of allegiance

157
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,030
for the court or for Right Chancellor?

158
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,310
Inspector He's loyalty to His Majesty

159
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,030
is obvious to all.

160
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,700
Does Right Chancellor

161
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,980
still have doubts

162
00:09:24,088 --> 00:09:25,644
about Inspector He's sincerity?

163
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,740
How about this?

164
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,220
Let me tell you a story

165
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,420
about the Chang'an banquet.

166
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,340
An official

167
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,820
needed to do something confidential.

168
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,340
He had two subordinates.

169
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:39,140
One has made meritorious achievements

170
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,822
while another has committed a crime.

171
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,088
How would you choose?

172
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:44,770
I'll choose
the one who committed a crime.

173
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,666
With evidence in my hand,
I can order him around.

174
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,100
I see.

175
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:52,100
As a low-ranking subordinate,

176
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,266
I'm not worthy to know
what's on the higher-ups' minds.

177
00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:55,940
Right Chancellor has given instructions.

178
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,580
A letter

179
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,580
in exchange for a tally.

180
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,180
(It is said)

181
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,260
(that He Youguang)

182
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,340
(experienced a disaster at sea
many years ago.)

183
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,420
(He was like an immortal evil spirit,)

184
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,820
(slaughtering in the blazing flames.)

185
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,700
(Fighting Bird)
(In the next decade,)

186
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,180
(he occupied Lingnan,)

187
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,340
(holding absolute power.)

188
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,540
(He Youguang, Gaozhou's Inspector)

189
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,060
Good news.

190
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,620
Good news.

191
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,740
Give it to me.

192
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,911
He didn't give it right away.

193
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:29,060
He said he had to personally

194
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,380
hand it to you.

195
00:10:30,888 --> 00:10:32,340
Why didn't you say that earlier?

196
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,220
I'll get it myself.

197
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,500
Calm down.

198
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,620
He made a request.

199
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,820
What request?

200
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,420
Right Chancellor

201
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,780
wants you

202
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,100
to write a letter of allegiance.

203
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,620
Write it then.

204
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,580
Don't say that.

205
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,820
This letter

206
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,860
isn't for His Majesty

207
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,300
but Right Chancellor.

208
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,340
You'll give others

209
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,180
solid leverage over you.

210
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,380
If someone sees this letter, then...

211
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,660
Then what?

212
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,100
Isn't it obvious?

213
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,300
We're indeed in collusion

214
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,340
with Right Chancellor.

215
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,380
That's different.

216
00:11:04,488 --> 00:11:05,540
What's the difference?

217
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,740
His Majesty can tolerate

218
00:11:08,177 --> 00:11:09,688
two ministers colluding.

219
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,260
One minister being loyal to another

220
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,180
instead of His Majesty

221
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,060
is a big problem.

222
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,700
Right Chancellor is calculating.

223
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,820
I think this matter

224
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,860
isn't that simple.

225
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,890
It's not that complicated.

226
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,733
It's not that simple.

227
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,030
It's not that complicated.

228
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,060
To put it bluntly, this letter

229
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,460
is just a token of allegiance.

230
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,460
After you give this letter to him,

231
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,020
he'll feel at ease.

232
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,620
When he feels at ease,

233
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,666
I will also feel at ease.

234
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,860
We'll both feel at ease.

235
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,820
We're all at ease now.

236
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,780
We can't be at ease.

237
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,260
He's using this military tally

238
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,100
to threaten us.

239
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,740
I think he's fishing.

240
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,980
What is he fishing for?

241
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,820
I've made up my mind.

242
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,700
Arrange it tonight.

243
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,180
Give him the letter.

244
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,100
Bring back the military tally.

245
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,860
All the things we sent

246
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,700
can't go to waste.

247
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,780
You're wise.

248
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,660
I worry too much.

249
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,180
Tonight, this military tally

250
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,180
will be yours tonight.

251
00:12:09,222 --> 00:12:10,500
That's the right attitude.

252
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,740
Let me tell you.

253
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,500
Once we get the military tally,

254
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,260
I'll replace

255
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:15,980
everyone

256
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,060
within three months.

257
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,380
Who in Lingnan

258
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,940
can possibly stand against us?

259
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,620
Yes.

260
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,660
With your methods,

261
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,860
Lingnan should be called Hezhou

262
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,700
by then.

263
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,820
Sir.

264
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,220
Is Inspector's Office this way?

265
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:57,140
(The 3rd day of February, 13th year
of Tianbao: Dispatch the Litchi Envoy)

266
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,300
(Inspector's Office)

267
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,940
Stop.

268
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,780
(Inspector's Office)

269
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,620
Who are you?

270
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,020
I'm the Litchi Envoy
appointed by the imperial court.

271
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,220
I'm here to see Inspector He.

272
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,220
Zhao.

273
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,260
Who

274
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,300
was the last envoy?

275
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,140
Coconut Envoy.

276
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,220
Coconut Envoy

277
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,260
came here

278
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,540
and fooled us.

279
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,020
Right?

280
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,220
The envoy this time is...

281
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,340
I'm Litchi Envoy.

282
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,220
Litchi Envoy?

283
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,660
What does Litchi Envoy do?

284
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,380
I...

285
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,380
I was ordered by His Majesty

286
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,500
to get fresh litchis.

287
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:23,066
It's all written
in the appointment decree.

288
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,580
Please

289
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,980
provide me with assistance.

290
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,980
To be honest,

291
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,820
it's well done.

292
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,300
Exquisite.

293
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,820
Look at the texture.

294
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,060
Not bad.

295
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,500
The fraud this time

296
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,460
is thoughtful.

297
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,860
Right.

298
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,820
I'm not a fraud.

299
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,100
I have Shanglin Office's badge.

300
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,380
If you can do this,

301
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,155
you can also make a waist badge.

302
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,620
No.

303
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,580
I'm really not a fraud.

304
00:15:52,866 --> 00:15:54,300
You can send a letter to the court

305
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,340
to verify it.

306
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,990
Bureau of Agriculture
and Shanglin Office

307
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,100
have documents to prove it.

308
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,420
Look.

309
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,460
This is a good idea.

310
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,100
It's more than 2500 km

311
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:05,180
from here to Chang'an.

312
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,980
I'll send a letter over

313
00:16:07,044 --> 00:16:08,244
with a fast horse tonight.

314
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,380
I think it will take about a month

315
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,460
to complete the procedures

316
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,980
and wait for a reply.

317
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,580
Come back in a month.

318
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,111
No, I can't wait more than a month.

319
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:19,340
I have to transport fresh litchis
back to Chang'an

320
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,355
on the 1st day of June.

321
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,940
You... Transport to Chang'an?

322
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,533
You can't even make up a story.

323
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,820
Get on your knees.

324
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,660
I...

325
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,020
No.

326
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:31,780
I want to teach you a lesson.

327
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,220
I

328
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,220
look down on people like you.

329
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,580
Is it so easy to be a fraud these days?

330
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,380
I'm not a fraud.

331
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,300
You're a fraud.

332
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,140
I'm not a fraud.

333
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,060
The threshold
for being a fraud isn't that low.

334
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,780
You have to work hard

335
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,220
and be attentive.

336
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,340
I'm open-minded

337
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,260
and allow anyone to deceive me,

338
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,420
but I will never allow others

339
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,220
to deceive me like I'm a fool!

340
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,180
Come.

341
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,300
Throw him into the river.

342
00:17:01,422 --> 00:17:01,940
Take him away.

343
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,100
Inspector He... Wait...

344
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,420
I'm not a fraud.

345
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,940
What are you doing?

346
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,580
Inspector He, I'm not a fraud.

347
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,333
What are you doing?

348
00:17:08,377 --> 00:17:09,220
Inspector He.

349
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,466
- Let me finish. I...
- Let go.

350
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,660
I haven't finished.

351
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,180
I'm not a fraud. I...

352
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,660
You scoundrel!

353
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,288
You're so stubborn at death's door.

354
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,020
You darn fraud.

355
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,140
I'm really not a fraud!

356
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,100
I really have an order from Chang'an.

357
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,340
I'm here for work.

358
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,780
What order and work?

359
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,180
What kind of idiot

360
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,200
can come up with an idea

361
00:17:28,288 --> 00:17:30,260
even dumber
than what an idiot would think of.

362
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,100
His Majesty.

363
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,580
His...

364
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:32,940
No.

365
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,820
Did you hear that?

366
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,860
How bold!

367
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,700
Let me tell you.

368
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,439
No need to throw him
into the river anymore.

369
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,310
Beat him to death now!

370
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:40,060
No.

371
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,580
Wait!

372
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,660
Wait.

373
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,140
This...

374
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,860
Inspector He.

375
00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:52,380
His Majesty's temperament

376
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,900
is very different from before.

377
00:17:54,955 --> 00:17:56,860
He has asked Lingnan
for many strange things

378
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,860
over the years.

379
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,740
It's hard to say

380
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,900
if he asked for fresh litchis this time.

381
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:07,860
Give me the sugarcane.

382
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:12,466
Let me think about it.

383
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,860
Sending fresh litchis
to Chang'an from so far away

384
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,540
is ridiculous in the first place.

385
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,820
You don't have any evidence

386
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,220
to make me trust you.

387
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,500
What should I do then?

388
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,244
I still have to take you
to feed the fish.

389
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,460
Take him away.

390
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,900
I know Pan Bao.

391
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,820
You sent Pan Bao to Chang'an, right?

392
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,740
He has a pretty face

393
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,660
and looks like a girl.

394
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,340
You...

395
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,420
How do you know Pan Bao?

396
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,260
I don't know him.

397
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:56,980
It was

398
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,020
a coincidence.

399
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,460
He drowned in Chang'an.

400
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,220
Drowned?

401
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:07,580
How did he drown?

402
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,580
Did Pan Bao go to Chang'an

403
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,220
to present this unique blackwood

404
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,580
to His Majesty?

405
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,740
Yes.

406
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,900
This blackwood

407
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,111
is my gift to His Majesty.

408
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:22,422
What does this
have to do with Pan Bao's death?

409
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,020
He went to Leyou Garden to plant it.

410
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,340
Then, he got drunk

411
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,220
near Ningbi Pond

412
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,060
and drowned.

413
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,340
I rescued him

414
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,940
and went to find help.

415
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,000
When I came back,
he fell into the water again.

416
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,940
Drunk?

417
00:19:34,422 --> 00:19:35,700
How do you know he was drunk?

418
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,940
A wine bottle

419
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,088
was left next to the pond.

420
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,700
Wine bottle?

421
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,180
So you didn't see him

422
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,500
drink it?

423
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,860
I didn't.

424
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,580
You should believe me now.

425
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,460
And my imperial edict

426
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,940
was circulated among Lingnan's

427
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,977
court assembly envoys.

428
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,860
You'll know if it's true once you ask.

429
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,911
Lingnan's court assembly envoys.

430
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,900
Come here.

431
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,540
Let me tell you the truth.

432
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,540
It doesn't matter

433
00:20:15,555 --> 00:20:17,060
if this imperial edict is true.

434
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,980
If it's fake,

435
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,660
I'll throw you into the river.

436
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,660
If it's true,

437
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,220
I can't send litchis

438
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,220
to Chang'an.

439
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,140
I still have

440
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,580
to kill you.

441
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,980
You're right.

442
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,420
I also experienced

443
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,860
the hardships along the way.

444
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,500
Transporting litchis back to Chang'an

445
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,340
is impossible.

446
00:20:43,288 --> 00:20:45,060
But I will be punished if I go back.

447
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,900
If you kill me,

448
00:20:47,444 --> 00:20:49,644
it's considered
as dying in service to His Majesty.

449
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:51,177
It won't implicate my family.

450
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,820
How about...

451
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,620
Well.

452
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,300
Just kill me.

453
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,540
Inspector He.

454
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
Can I have a word with you?

455
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,940
Ma Guiyun didn't tell me

456
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,620
about Pan Bao's accident.

457
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,220
Maybe he left early

458
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,180
and didn't know.

459
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,020
Maybe

460
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,140
he's hiding something.

461
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,340
We can't give him...

462
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,180
Give me some water.

463
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,711
That letter of allegiance.

464
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,380
You're...

465
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,100
What envoy was it?

466
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,020
Litchi Envoy.

467
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,660
Litchi Envoy.

468
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,700
Here's the thing.

469
00:22:04,244 --> 00:22:05,460
I need to further verify

470
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,300
your purpose here.

471
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,740
It will take some time.

472
00:22:11,244 --> 00:22:12,420
Go back first.

473
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,540
Chief Scribe Zhao.

474
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,949
We made this. It's fresh.

475
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:18,780
Send it to my residence.

476
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,620
Sure.

477
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:40,460
Inspector's Office wants you

478
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,620
to investigate Ma Guiyun.

479
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,940
I didn't expect
the people sent by Security Bureau

480
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,860
to be exposed so quickly.

481
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,820
Gatekeeper!

482
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,340
Gatekeeper.

483
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,500
Inspector He said

484
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,220
he wanted to verify my identity.

485
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,380
He got to give me an answer.

486
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,500
Inspector He is busy.

487
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,780
He can't handle

488
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,620
your matter so soon.

489
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,940
Come back another day.

490
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,060
No.

491
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,140
Gatekeeper, look.

492
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,020
Well.

493
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,580
It's getting late.

494
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,180
I don't have a place to stay either.

495
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,500
Can Chief Scribe Zhao

496
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:28,180
give me a place to spend the night?

497
00:23:28,777 --> 00:23:31,350
Chief Scribe Zhao
has gone to Qifeng Pavilion for a drink.

498
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,780
No.

499
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,620
Well.

500
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,100
Well.

501
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,580
How do I get to Qifeng Pavilion?

502
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,780
I'm Lan Yu.

503
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,740
(Lan Yu)
Greetings, Mr. Ma.

504
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,300
Lan Yu?

505
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,540
I've long heard that Mr. Ma

506
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,500
is a big shot with great influence.

507
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,620
I didn't expect you to be so elegant.

508
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,460
You're indeed a young and promising man

509
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,620
from the capital.

510
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,900
You came from Chang'an.

511
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,660
How does Chang'an

512
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,540
compare to Lingnan?

513
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,460
Chang'an

514
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,260
is the most prosperous city.

515
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,020
The lights are like fire,

516
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,340
while the flags are like clouds.

517
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,180
Taverns alone

518
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,420
stretched for dozens of meters.

519
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,022
Even the palaces in the heavens

520
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,660
are no match for it.

521
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,460
Won't we Lingnan people

522
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,300
be overjoyed

523
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,940
when we get to Chang'an?

524
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,780
I really envy Pan Bao

525
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,620
for seeing such scenery.

526
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,940
Pan Bao

527
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,860
frequents Qifeng Pavilion.

528
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,780
He's popular here.

529
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,460
The girls all know him.

530
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,800
Do you know Bao?

531
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,140
Yes.

532
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,580
We had a few drinks

533
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,820
at Chang'an.

534
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,540
He's decisive.

535
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,780
Bao has old injuries

536
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,060
and never drank when he was in Lingnan.

537
00:24:58,466 --> 00:24:59,380
Looks like Chang'an

538
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,500
is a blessed place.

539
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,820
Bao's injury healed after this visit.

540
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,420
Yes.

541
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,140
It's no use

542
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,780
even if he

543
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,420
doesn't drink

544
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,260
or makes excuses.

545
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,300
Because there's a job called Assistant
Minister of Entertainment in Chang'an.

546
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,860
No one can escape

547
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,340
his drinking party.

548
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,700
No one.

549
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,620
He is very decisive.

550
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,620
Mr. Ma

551
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,540
came all the way to Lingnan.

552
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,900
How many days did it take you?

553
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,260
It took me...

554
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,620
Gou'er, we took

555
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,700
almost 25 days.

556
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,620
How far away.

557
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,700
I just received news

558
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,180
that Pan Bao

559
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,860
died in Chang'an's

560
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,900
Leyou Garden 26 days ago.

561
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,740
26 days ago?

562
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,980
Pan Bao died?

563
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,740
How come I didn't receive any news?

564
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,780
Who told you that?

565
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,580
A

566
00:26:27,444 --> 00:26:29,155
Litchi Envoy from Chang'an.

567
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,500
Looks like

568
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,500
you're more willing to believe

569
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,700
someone of unknown background

570
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,180
that Right Chancellor's envoy

571
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:49,020
with a token.

572
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,500
I respect Right Chancellor,

573
00:26:57,044 --> 00:26:58,688
but there's one thing
I don't understand.

574
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,180
Why did Right Chancellor

575
00:27:02,244 --> 00:27:03,933
insist on this letter of allegiance?

576
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,540
If the enemy gets it,

577
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,860
it'll be dangerous

578
00:27:08,422 --> 00:27:10,180
to us and Right Chancellor.

579
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,140
You're full of suspicion.

580
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,860
I can't explain too much.

581
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,380
Looks like Lingnan doesn't welcome me.

582
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,540
What are you saying?

583
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,060
I'll go back to Chang'an.

584
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,780
You can go to Chang'an

585
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,940
to get the military tally.

586
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,500
Mr. Ma.

587
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,300
Don't. We haven't drunk enough.

588
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,700
Look at how anxious you are.

589
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,540
We're just joking.

590
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,860
It's not that I don't trust you.

591
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,300
Lingnan is too far away from Chang'an.

592
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,540
Communication is difficult.

593
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,380
There's quite a lot of activity
at court.

594
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,620
We don't know much.

595
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,380
I work for Inspector He.

596
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,940
I need

597
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,020
to explain everything to him.

598
00:28:01,777 --> 00:28:03,620
Guiyun,

599
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,460
please forgive me.

600
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,860
Lingnan's joke

601
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,500
sounds really serious.

602
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,060
The truth will reveal itself

603
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,340
in a few days.

604
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,300
Go to hell.

605
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,420
Don't touch my litchis!

606
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,260
Go to hell.

607
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,820
Don't touch it!

608
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:27,780
Put it down!

609
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,620
Come here.

610
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,060
Don't push me!

611
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,860
Don't push me!

612
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,620
Stop!

613
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,900
Stop.

614
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,660
If I were you,

615
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:43,100
I'd leave immediately.

616
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,060
Who are you?

617
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,260
Tang Law

618
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,620
states that those who fight

619
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,460
will get 40 lashes.

620
00:28:50,777 --> 00:28:51,980
Damaging someone's property

621
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,220
will be compensated with double

622
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,260
the property's worth.

623
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,500
If you five

624
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,740
fought,

625
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,700
you'll get 200 lashes.

626
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,260
If you destroy someone's property,
you'll get 300 lashes.

627
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,100
Miss, how much

628
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:06,980
are you litchis?

629
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,060
Ten...

630
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:08,900
(Tong)

631
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,060
500 g for 15 coins.

632
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,180
A basket can weigh more than 20 kg!

633
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,140
500 g for 15 coins.

634
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,933
One basket is 20 kg.

635
00:29:13,933 --> 00:29:15,260
Two baskets are 40 kg.

636
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,500
The total is

637
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,620
1 guan and 200 coins.

638
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,100
Double the amount

639
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,620
is 2 guan and 400 coins.

640
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,340
If you five share it,

641
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,740
each person is 480 coins.

642
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,500
Anyway,

643
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,180
I did the calculations for you.

644
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,620
Think about it.

645
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,220
Thank you.

646
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,860
Are these freshly picked

647
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,700
litchis?

648
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,380
Yes.

649
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,500
Fresh litchis.

650
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,540
But aren't litchis only available
in April?

651
00:29:55,644 --> 00:29:57,200
These are early-ripening litchis.

652
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,444
They're called March Red.

653
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,020
What does it taste like?

654
00:30:00,355 --> 00:30:02,155
It doesn't taste good. It's too sour.

655
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:03,340
We use them to make wine,

656
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,700
so it's cheap.

657
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,740
So March Red

658
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,260
can only be kept for three days?

659
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,533
But we natives have a secret technique

660
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,020
to preserve it longer.

661
00:30:16,911 --> 00:30:17,980
What secret technique?

662
00:30:19,222 --> 00:30:20,577
Don't pick it from the tree.

663
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,380
Here.

664
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,380
Weigh some March Red for me.

665
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,740
I just helped you.

666
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,860
Can you give me a discount?

667
00:30:34,244 --> 00:30:35,377
You can have them for free.

668
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:36,700
I won't owe anyone a favor.

669
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,980
Thank you for helping me.

670
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,940
Give me less.

671
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,700
They've begun

672
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,540
to suspect me.

673
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,380
I won't be able

674
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,100
to get this letter for a while.

675
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,155
What should we do then?

676
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,340
It's fine.

677
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,140
We'll just wait and see.

678
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,100
Where did this Litchi Envoy come from?

679
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,140
He ruined my plans.

680
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,460
I'll see you tomorrow night.

681
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,570
Alright.

682
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,960
Drink with me...

683
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,060
Li Shande?

684
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,220
Did you see?

685
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,780
Is it him?

686
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,260
Qilang, you must be drunk.

687
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,620
Chief Scribe Zhao.

688
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,460
Why are you here?

689
00:31:34,822 --> 00:31:36,340
The gatekeeper said you're here.

690
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,260
I brought you some fresh litchis to try.

691
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,860
Alright, I'm from Lingnan.

692
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,620
Why try fresh litchis?

693
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,800
No, you've been eating it
since you were little.

694
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,100
But His Majesty in Chang'an
has never tried it.

695
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,900
We'll talk about your
business tomorrow, alright?

696
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,600
I'm hosting a dinner
for a friend today.

697
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,580
Go back and wait. Alright?

698
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,688
No, I can't go back.

699
00:31:53,688 --> 00:31:54,860
I don't have a place to stay.

700
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,700
How about I wait here

701
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,420
until you're done?

702
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,377
How could that work?

703
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,500
I don't have a place to stay.

704
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,300
Guiyun.

705
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,100
No.

706
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,940
Well...

707
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,260
Ping'an?

708
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,700
Yes.

709
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,479
I arrived at Lingnan smoothly.
[*Ping'an and safe are homophones]

710
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,500
Why are you here too?

711
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,660
No.

712
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,980
It's a long story.

713
00:32:11,177 --> 00:32:12,540
I went to find you before I left.

714
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,540
Now, Ping'an, you...

715
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,220
You're safe. I'm safe.

716
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,460
Being safe matters the most.

717
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,488
I didn't expect
to meet someone I know here.

718
00:32:18,955 --> 00:32:20,911
Chief Scribe Zhao and I
have important things to discuss.

719
00:32:20,911 --> 00:32:21,980
We'll talk until late at night.

720
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,300
Go back first. Let's talk another day.

721
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,220
- Go back.
- Go back.

722
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,060
Chief Scribe Zhao.

723
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,220
Ping'an?

724
00:32:33,022 --> 00:32:35,288
Is this how people in Chang'an
greet each other now?

725
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,700
Many things are popular in Chang'an.

726
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,380
Greeting...

727
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,540
Ping'an is just one of them.

728
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,020
There are Fu'an and Lu'an.

729
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,977
They're all greetings.

730
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,980
Do you know the person just now?

731
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,820
What does he do?

732
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,500
What does he do? His name

733
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,380
is Li Shande.

734
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,940
He's the supervisor of Shanglin Office.

735
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,580
He was probably

736
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,500
sent to Lingnan

737
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,780
by His Majesty.

738
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,060
There are many frauds nowadays.

739
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,140
We've all

740
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,500
suffered.

741
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,740
There are many in Chang'an.

742
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,180
Really?

743
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,980
Someone dares to trick

744
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,060
someone like you?

745
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:11,940
Last month,

746
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,020
a distant relative

747
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,260
just scammed 20 guan from me.

748
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,100
Enough of this.

749
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,980
- Let's drink.
- Let's drink.

750
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,340
Let's go.

751
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,500
Ouch.

752
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,700
I’m sorry, Mr. Li.

753
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,540
Leave with me first.

754
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,060
No.

755
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,220
Why are you here?

756
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:27,090
We'll talk about it when we get back.

757
00:33:27,111 --> 00:33:28,090
Where should I go back to?

758
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:28,980
I have no place to stay.

759
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,220
I'll wait for Chief Scribe Zhao

760
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,644
to arrange accommodation for me.

761
00:33:31,644 --> 00:33:32,660
You can stay at our inn.

762
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,290
Don't bother Chief Scribe Zhao
with this.

763
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,900
I can settle this.

764
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:37,980
No.

765
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,133
You haven't eaten, right?

766
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,380
Let's go.

767
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:57,940
Coming.

768
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,688
You're back, Mr. Ma.

769
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,700
Mr. Li.

770
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,460
Eating like this

771
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,088
can easily give you indigestion.

772
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,940
Qilang.

773
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,660
Ping'an.

774
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,900
Li Shande.

775
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,580
Come in.

776
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,580
Li Shande.

777
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,700
My legs are numb.

778
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,380
When did you become Litchi Envoy?

779
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,460
I was schemed against

780
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,260
before you left Chang'an.

781
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,980
I took on this difficult task.

782
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,300
Where's Xiu'er?

783
00:34:51,244 --> 00:34:52,780
I wanted to entrust her to you,

784
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,420
but you left too.

785
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,377
I can only entrust her
to the embroidery house.

786
00:34:56,377 --> 00:34:57,444
Embroidery house?

787
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,140
You're something else, Li Shande.

788
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,060
You're something else.

789
00:35:03,866 --> 00:35:04,980
You're something else.

790
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,755
Why did you come to Lingnan

791
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,020
and mention Pan Bao?

792
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,620
If I don't mention him,
He Youguang won't believe me.

793
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:13,860
He...

794
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,700
He also said he would

795
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,740
throw me into the river

796
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,580
to feed river perch.

797
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,260
You met He Youguang?

798
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,300
Yes.

799
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,533
I haven't asked yet, Ping'an.

800
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,140
Why did you come to Lingnan?

801
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:24,820
That's not important anymore.

802
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,420
Just remember

803
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,780
that I'm not Zheng Ping'an

804
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,700
but Ma Guiyun.

805
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,620
Ma who?

806
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,500
Ma Guiyun.

807
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,020
Ma...

808
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,820
Who is Ma Guiyun?

809
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,420
Me.

810
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,533
Aren't you Zheng Ping'an?

811
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,460
Ma Guiyun!

812
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,660
This is a big deal.

813
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,500
If it's a big deal,

814
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,740
you should consult me.

815
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,540
No, Ping'an.

816
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,700
Although the Zheng family

817
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,660
expelled you,

818
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,460
why did you come to Lingnan

819
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,940
and take the surname Ma?

820
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:48,780
What?

821
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,311
Is it a prominent family in Lingnan?

822
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,180
You married in?

823
00:35:52,488 --> 00:35:53,620
No, your sister is gone.

824
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,290
I have to take care of you
for your sister.

825
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,140
Shut up.

826
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,500
How dare you mention my sister?

827
00:36:00,422 --> 00:36:01,380
My sister married you

828
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,380
and lost her life.

829
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,620
Xiu'er has been under your care.

830
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,460
We don't even know

831
00:36:04,644 --> 00:36:05,740
if she's dead or alive.

832
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,777
You came all the way here.

833
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,340
Do you want to kill

834
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,060
the Zheng family?

835
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:10,900
No.

836
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,140
You want the Zheng family to die. Right?

837
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,100
A plague.

838
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:17,860
You're hurting me by saying this.

839
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,620
Shouldn't I hurt you?

840
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,620
Why do you want to hurt me?

841
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,460
From now on,

842
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,980
I will go my own way,

843
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,580
and you can walk your own path.

844
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,340
Get lost.

845
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,100
No. Why are you called Ma Guiyun?

846
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,340
Get lost!

847
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,300
Just remember I'm Ma Guiyun.

848
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,020
And you have to be afraid of me.

849
00:36:39,222 --> 00:36:40,500
Why should I be afraid of you?

850
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,340
You're afraid of me.

851
00:36:41,377 --> 00:36:42,911
Why should I be afraid of you?

852
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:45,980
Get out.

853
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,940
Get out.

854
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,340
Get lost.

855
00:36:53,777 --> 00:36:55,100
Something's wrong with you.

856
00:36:55,222 --> 00:36:56,500
My good brother-in-law.

857
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,780
Get lost.

858
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,860
Is something wrong with you?

859
00:37:56,022 --> 00:37:57,733
Didn't you tell me to be afraid of you?

860
00:38:03,822 --> 00:38:04,911
I was scared to death.

861
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,260
Is he staying here?

862
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,660
Who arranged it?

863
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,060
Mr. Li said

864
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:20,900
there was no problem.

865
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:22,220
We can put it on the tab.

866
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,140
Whose tab?

867
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,780
Alright.

868
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,620
Fine.

869
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,860
He's trained in calculations.

870
00:38:35,866 --> 00:38:37,400
Instead of figuring out
anything in his life,

871
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,377
he schemed against me.

872
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,220
Please take a look at this.

873
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,300
(Zhengwen Study)

874
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,220
Are you looking for any book?

875
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,460
You may tell me.

876
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,780
I'll find it for you.

877
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,860
I was asked

878
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,140
to find a book that is a quite rare.

879
00:39:12,155 --> 00:39:13,666
"Treatise on Consciousness-Only".

880
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:14,980
Do you have it?

881
00:39:42,066 --> 00:39:44,022
Are Left Chancellor
and Deputy Director Lu

882
00:39:44,022 --> 00:39:44,933
in good health?

883
00:39:44,933 --> 00:39:45,700
(Yun Qing)

884
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,780
They're in good health.

885
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,420
Thank you for your concern,
Master Konglang.

886
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,500
I'm afraid that they're

887
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,380
not in a good mood.

888
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,340
They sent a spy to Lingnan,

889
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,820
but he was exposed

890
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,133
as soon as he arrived.

891
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,420
You

892
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,860
knew?

893
00:40:10,111 --> 00:40:11,540
Left Chancellor recognizes talent.

894
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,220
I thought he would choose

895
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,140
someone capable.

896
00:40:14,488 --> 00:40:16,100
Even if he's not as good as Song Wuji,

897
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,780
he should at least be smarter.

898
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,180
Who knew

899
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,380
he was an idiot.

900
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,780
Let me remind you.

901
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,100
I'll help you

902
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,180
complete the mission,

903
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,340
but if you fail the mission,

904
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,980
I won't let you leave Lingnan City.

905
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,860
Thank you for your honesty.

906
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,740
I'm

907
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,820
not as capable as Song Wuji,

908
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,540
but I will risk my life.

909
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,780
Not to the extent

910
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,660
of letting my devotion go cold.

911
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,420
I can prove to Inspector's Office

912
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,860
that you're Ma Guiyun,

913
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,580
but

914
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,820
you have to gain their trust

915
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,380
yourself.

916
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,900
They already believed me.

917
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,380
A Litchi Envoy appeared suddenly

918
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,700
and leaked Pan Bao's death,

919
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,020
which made them suspicious.

920
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,660
You just need to prove

921
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,060
that Litchi Envoy is lying then.

922
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,666
Wouldn't that solve the problem?

923
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,180
Litchi Envoy is stubborn to the core.

924
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,100
(If I say he's lying,)

925
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,860
(he'll do everything he can)

926
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,977
(to prove that I'm lying.)

927
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,700
(And he knows me.)

928
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:40,980
He...

929
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,540
He knows I'm not Ma Guiyun.

930
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,820
It's easier to solve if you know him.

931
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,620
Get him to join you.

932
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,100
My relationship with him

933
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:54,740
is a bit special.

934
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,860
It's not like that.

935
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,060
I just

936
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,740
want him to stop bothering me.

937
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,300
It's not like that.

938
00:42:19,533 --> 00:42:20,220
It's that we...

939
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,377
You don't have to explain.

940
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,260
If

941
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,700
you can't even handle

942
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,660
a mere Litchi Envoy,

943
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,580
how can you handle

944
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,420
He Youguang?

945
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,100
=The Litchi Road=

946
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,900
Ma Guiyun is leaving?

947
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,620
If you don't know who's Ma Guiyun,

948
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,340
you can live for four months.

949
00:42:39,955 --> 00:42:41,260
If you know who Ma Guiyun is,

950
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,288
