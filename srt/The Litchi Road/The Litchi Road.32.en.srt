=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,860
(Peacock Feather)

3
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,110
A long time ago,

4
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,130
in a poor and forgotten village,

5
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,140
there lived a lovable boy.

6
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,740
Nearly every day,

7
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,660
he would lead

8
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,500
the family's only lamb up the hill,

9
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,044
where they'd stand under a tree...

10
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,020
And

11
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,977
watch the ocean together.

12
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,300
One day,

13
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,460
the southeast wind

14
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,060
brought a big ship to shore.

15
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,100
The boy and his lamb hopped

16
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,955
and ran joyfully to the beach.

17
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,040
Several bearded merchants

18
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,900
came down from the ship.

19
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,300
When they found out

20
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,220
there was nothing here,

21
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,488
they were very disappointed.

22
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,360
So they decided to leave the next day

23
00:02:27,377 --> 00:02:29,733
when the wind picked up again.

24
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,880
They asked the boy

25
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,840
if he wanted

26
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,200
to become a sailor

27
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,644
and travel with them
to the far side of the sea,

28
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,930
to see a world

29
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,466
as golden as treasure.

30
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,260
The boy was tempted.

31
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,900
But the lamb seemed

32
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,610
to sense danger.

33
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,010
It kept butting the merchants

34
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,670
with its horns.

35
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,480
One merchant took a peacock feather

36
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,280
from his hat

37
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,570
and said to the boy,

38
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,810
"I'll trade you this rare
and precious feather

39
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,150
for your lamb."

40
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,900
The boy replied,

41
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,030
"No.

42
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,820
I will never trade

43
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,300
my only friend."

44
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,420
And with that,

45
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,920
he took the lamb and left.

46
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,460
Up on the hillside,

47
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,900
the boy fell asleep.

48
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,220
When he woke up, the lamb was gone.

49
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,300
No matter how loudly he called,

50
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,244
there was no answer.

51
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,460
He blew his whistle hard

52
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,333
and ran everywhere searching for it.

53
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,140
At sunset,

54
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,500
the boy returned to the beach.

55
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,300
Suddenly,
he smelled something delicious.

56
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,100
He saw the merchants gathered

57
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,430
around a fire by the beach.

58
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,030
They were feasting
on the roasted meat,

59
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,860
bite after bite.

60
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,500
A lamb's hide was tied

61
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,780
around one merchant's waist.

62
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,130
The boy went mad

63
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,244
and ran at them in a rage.

64
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:14,320
He was ready to fight them
with everything he had.

65
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,740
But a merchant gently pushed him,

66
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,260
and the boy fell hard

67
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,100
onto the sand.

68
00:04:22,288 --> 00:04:23,670
The merchant said...

69
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,320
"Only the weak

70
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,266
cry over scattered sand dunes.

71
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,740
Come.

72
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,540
If you're a winner,

73
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,140
I'll invite you

74
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,940
to be the first guest

75
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,622
at tonight's feast."

76
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,940
Maybe at that moment,

77
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,500
the boy understood something.

78
00:04:48,044 --> 00:04:49,466
When the wind picked up

79
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,200
the next day,

80
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,100
the boy boarded the big ship.

81
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,440
Slowly, it sailed away from the shore.

82
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,680
Behind him was the barren village.

83
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,260
Ahead was the end of the sea,

84
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,460
a world made of gold.

85
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,820
The boy became a sailor.

86
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,980
In his hand,

87
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,280
he held tightly onto

88
00:05:17,844 --> 00:05:19,733
that peacock feather.

89
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,540
=Episode 32=

90
00:05:58,488 --> 00:05:59,955
Lingnan's litchis will surely take

91
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,590
the entire Tang Empire by storm.

92
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,740
That's why the Litchi Fund
must be launched.

93
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:11,730
It's a secure
and profit-guaranteed trade indeed.

94
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,470
This Litchi Fund is priced

95
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,740
at 500 coins per share.

96
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,800
We hope the people
will be eager to invest.

97
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,700
If the litchi route goes smoothly,

98
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,311
the value of the Litchi Fund
will surely multiply.

99
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,340
Litchi Fund?

100
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,280
Sounds like that Sea Sail Fund

101
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,060
to me.

102
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,700
We should learn from our mistakes.

103
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,133
Everyone lost big
on the Sea Sail Fund back then.

104
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:43,888
That's right.

105
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,510
Silence! Silence.

106
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:49,900
Everyone!

107
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,700
I know

108
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,355
what you're worrying about.

109
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,260
Think about it.

110
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,780
The Sea Sail Fund

111
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,400
was run by a pirate,

112
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,060
right?

113
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,688
When he died,
no one took responsibility.

114
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,460
But this Litchi Fund is issued

115
00:07:07,822 --> 00:07:10,240
by the official government.

116
00:07:10,444 --> 00:07:12,666
Within our reach,
we have the Inspector's Office.

117
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,420
A little further,
we have His Majesty himself.

118
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,466
That's the best guarantee
we could ever ask for.

119
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,650
That makes sense.

120
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,940
Let me be real with you.

121
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,822
He has a point there.

122
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:24,911
The merchants

123
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,620
have always wanted to profit from this.

124
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,620
But the Inspector's Office cares

125
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,980
about the people of Lingnan.

126
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,420
So we want

127
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,980
to give these benefits

128
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,000
to all of you.

129
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,777
Bring prosperity to the region,
am I right?

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,140
You've all seen

131
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,340
Litchi Envoy do the trial run.

132
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,490
This time, we'll send Gaozhou's litchis

133
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,511
to Chang'an for His Majesty to taste.

134
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,740
When that happens, Gaozhou's litchis

135
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,520
will become famous across the empire!

136
00:07:54,577 --> 00:07:55,990
How much is one share again?

137
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,520
It's 500 coins a share.

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,700
If you want more information,

139
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,880
head over that way.

140
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,780
Come on, let's go check it out!

141
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,900
Yeah, let's find out more.

142
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,010
Sir,

143
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,100
would you mind explaining this again?

144
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,577
Litchi Fund announcement.

145
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,950
Lingnan litchis are thriving.

146
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,666
His Majesty has sent
the Litchi Inspector here in person.

147
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:21,430
Mr. Su,

148
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:24,022
what's really going on
with this Litchi Fund?

149
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:24,844
I'm curious too.

150
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,500
I believe you all know
the kind of person Inspector He is.

151
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:29,980
He likely launches the Litchi Fund

152
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,066
to profit from the situation.

153
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,560
If you invest

154
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,700
at this time,

155
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:37,560
you'll be playing right into
the Inspector's Office's hands.

156
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,210
Once the people start rushing in

157
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,530
and throwing in their money,

158
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,750
no one will know

159
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,090
where all

160
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,740
that wealth will end up.

161
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,333
Don't invest.

162
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,150
How many more families
will be ruined like this?

163
00:08:53,155 --> 00:08:53,800
And remember,

164
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:55,800
the future is unpredictable.

165
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,020
Also,

166
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,420
I'm sure

167
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,340
you still remember

168
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,420
the Sea Sail Fund disaster.

169
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,260
It was He Youguang

170
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,730
who sabotaged it.

171
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,980
I lost a lot back then.

172
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:09,880
- Yes.
- Exactly.

173
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,940
Now, he's at it again.

174
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,600
I'll be the first to boycott this.

175
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,844
I won't put in a single coin.

176
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:15,570
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

177
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,820
Please calm down.

178
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,860
Mr. Su, just give it to us straight.

179
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,620
We won't buy the Litchi Fund.

180
00:09:21,622 --> 00:09:23,980
When will the litchi shipment
actually open for investment?

181
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,860
Good things take time.

182
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,540
Give Mr. Li a little more time.

183
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,100
I believe in his character.

184
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,688
Everyone can rest assured.

185
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,700
As they say, don't give up

186
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,900
until it's absolutely hopeless.

187
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,540
I

188
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,330
won't give up so easily.

189
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,060
Li Shande,

190
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,900
is Mr. Su still upset with you?

191
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,120
This is my fault.

192
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,750
I'll go and apologize to him in person

193
00:09:54,755 --> 00:09:56,177
and explain everything today.

194
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,780
Mr. Su,

195
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,111
you're here!

196
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:15,940
I

197
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,020
came specifically to visit Mr. Li.

198
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,520
I also brought you

199
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,920
something quite unique.

200
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,900
What is it?

201
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,660
The people are calling it

202
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,688
the Litchi Fund.

203
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,460
(Lingnan Litchi Fund.
Litchi 500 Shares)

204
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:47,644
(Lingnan Litchi Fund.
Litchi 500 Shares)

205
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,460
How dare an Inspector of Lingnan

206
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,688
do something so disgraceful?

207
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:56,340
We are the ones responsible

208
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,700
for the litchi shipment.

209
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,700
Yet he's trying

210
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,460
to profit right

211
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,288
in front of the two imperial envoys?

212
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,210
Such shamelessness!

213
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,060
Clearly, he's used

214
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,460
to exploiting the people.

215
00:11:10,577 --> 00:11:11,700
Mr. Li, please rest assured.

216
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,340
Once I return to Chang'an,

217
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:15,511
I'll report this to the Right Chancellor

218
00:11:15,644 --> 00:11:16,866
and have that man dealt with.

219
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,960
Normally, I'd wait

220
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,177
until we're back in Chang'an

221
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,340
to settle the score.

222
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,870
But the litchi shipment

223
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,970
is urgent.

224
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,260
If we allow this fundraising,

225
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,260
Mr. Su's efforts

226
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,111
will be all for nothing.

227
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,260
Yes, we're not giving him
the trade route.

228
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,700
But we should give him

229
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,700
his fair share of the profits, right?

230
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,940
After all, he has been nothing
but loyal to me.

231
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,977
If this fund is launched,

232
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,440
everyone will benefit from this fund.

233
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,860
Even those who did nothing

234
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,740
will benefit from it.

235
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,900
How can Mr. Su

236
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,140
possibly feel okay about it?

237
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,200
If he's upset, he won't give me
the double-layer jar.

238
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,288
Without that, how am I
supposed to transport litchis?

239
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,100
Double-layer jar?

240
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,740
I've seen that jar

241
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:57,940
in the transport plan.

242
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,190
Without it, litchis can only stay fresh

243
00:12:00,222 --> 00:12:01,920
for seven days.

244
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,620
Exactly.

245
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,620
That jar is crucial
to the whole shipment.

246
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,488
So, is Mr. Su the only one

247
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,170
who has it?

248
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,880
Yes, he's the only one.

249
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,880
Some foreign merchants have it too.

250
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,890
But it'll be too late
to transport the jars here now.

251
00:12:21,488 --> 00:12:23,020
This is bad.

252
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:27,100
It may seem minor.

253
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,430
But the consequences could be severe.

254
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,300
Why don't

255
00:12:33,644 --> 00:12:35,750
you tell He Youguang to call it off?

256
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:37,666
Call the whole thing off.

257
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,740
Call it off?

258
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,755
He Youguang is the Inspector. I am...

259
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,640
I'm just an attendant
from the inner court.

260
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,820
I have no power over him.

261
00:12:46,955 --> 00:12:48,100
Who says you have no power?

262
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,140
You're not here as an Attendant.

263
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,580
You're the Inspector.

264
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,460
Sir,

265
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,740
you need to step in.

266
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,140
Isn't He Youguang

267
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:55,940
stirring up

268
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,540
the people of Lingnan?

269
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,340
He's lining his own pockets.

270
00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:02,488
How is that any different
from exploiting the people?

271
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,329
You're the Inspector.

272
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,760
It's your job to hold him accountable.

273
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,480
Investigate him. Arrest him.

274
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,700
I'm only afraid people will say

275
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,900
I'm abusing my authority.

276
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,819
Who dares say that?

277
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,680
I have the silver token
from the Right Chancellor!

278
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,740
Who outranks him?

279
00:13:15,777 --> 00:13:17,300
If it comes to it, I'll testify for you

280
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,620
when we get back to Chang'an.

281
00:13:19,044 --> 00:13:20,800
He must be brought to justice!

282
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,500
Mr. Li.

283
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,660
If you're willing to vouch for me,

284
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,580
then no matter the danger,

285
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,777
I'll face it head-on.

286
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:56,060
(Inspector's Office)

287
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,400
I've been sent

288
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,500
to see Inspector He.

289
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,900
Please let him know.

290
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,900
Inspector He is busy
with official business.

291
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,440
Do you think
a mere Taoist priest like you

292
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,020
can just walk in and meet him?

293
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,700
Then pass on this message

294
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,140
to Inspector He.

295
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,740
Tell those back home in Fanyang

296
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,580
that my conscience is clear.

297
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,777
Reverend,

298
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,780
please follow me.

299
00:14:53,900 --> 00:15:10,430
(Inspector's Office)

300
00:15:11,755 --> 00:15:12,555
Close the doors.

301
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:13,260
Yes, Sir.

302
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,380
All of you leave.

303
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,020
I don't want to be disturbed.

304
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:33,288
Greetings, Reverend.

305
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,940
That distinguished figure
from Fanyang says

306
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,180
the moment has come

307
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,066
and asks if you are ready.

308
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,111
I've waited ten years for this.

309
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,980
Not a single day have I slacked.

310
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,022
Now, at last, I won't let him down.

311
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,080
I've secured the military tally,

312
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,488
and the navy is under my command.

313
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,620
I shall await his orders.

314
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,300
(Inspector's Office)

315
00:16:09,555 --> 00:16:10,500
Chief Scribe Zhao,

316
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,900
what was so urgent?

317
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,750
I don't know why.

318
00:16:14,688 --> 00:16:16,600
But the Inspector He
locked himself away.

319
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,020
He's not seeing anyone, not even me.

320
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,540
Not even you?

321
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,170
The gatekeeper said

322
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,200
a young Taoist visited him
the other day.

323
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,370
After that meeting,

324
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,022
the Inspector has not been himself.

325
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,180
Don't worry.

326
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,300
Inspector He
must be thinking things through.

327
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,300
I'm more concerned

328
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,190
about the Litchi Fund.

329
00:16:42,755 --> 00:16:45,420
Many Hu merchants are holding back,
so the people are watching and waiting.

330
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:46,822
We've only sold 10% of the shares.

331
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,110
Now,

332
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:51,577
the Inspector has shut himself away.

333
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,260
He must be struggling

334
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,820
with something

335
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,940
he can't overcome.

336
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,860
We're his right-hand men.

337
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:06,620
We need to help him carry the load.

338
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,340
You're right.

339
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,500
But I still don't get it.

340
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,520
The money-making opportunity

341
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,890
is practically knocking on the door.

342
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,420
Why won't the Hu merchants invest?

343
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,555
It's all because of Su Liang.

344
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,888
He thinks that since he funded

345
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:21,990
the initial litchi shipment,

346
00:17:22,177 --> 00:17:23,890
he deserves the lion's share
of the profits.

347
00:17:24,022 --> 00:17:25,520
So he rallied the other Hu merchants

348
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,060
to boycott the Litchi Fund.

349
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,500
This old fox

350
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:29,700
is trying to outsmart us

351
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,540
on our own turf?

352
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,220
I'll arrest him

353
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,022
and make an example out of him.

354
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,050
Doing that

355
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,740
will scare the rest into line.

356
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,340
But going after Su Liang

357
00:17:44,555 --> 00:17:46,577
will definitely alert Li Shande.

358
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,920
Li Shande has the Right Chancellor's
silver token now.

359
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,444
Things aren't like they used to be.

360
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,540
Do you have a plan?

361
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,740
I do.

362
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,511
But if we go after Su Liang,

363
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,180
we need a justifiable reason.

364
00:18:05,777 --> 00:18:07,355
Out of the way!

365
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,420
Move aside!

366
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,340
What's going on?

367
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,220
Get out of the way!

368
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,340
Captain Yang, what a surprise.

369
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,311
To what do I owe the visit?

370
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,260
Mr. Su,

371
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,970
we've discovered

372
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,311
that one of your trading branches

373
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,580
has forged

374
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,660
the customs permits.

375
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,300
Care to explain?

376
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,800
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

377
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,380
Come on, Mr. Su.

378
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,540
Stop pretending you don't understand.

379
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,660
Not only did you forge permits,

380
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:44,920
but you also

381
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,380
faked Mr. Li's name

382
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,300
and claimed you were working for him.

383
00:18:49,555 --> 00:18:50,740
You even forged five copies

384
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,940
of that permit.

385
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,740
That's some nerve you have there!

386
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,740
You must be joking.

387
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,020
I wouldn't dare do such a thing.

388
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,840
There must be some mistake.

389
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,422
You must have been misled.

390
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,980
The Inspector's Office never acts

391
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,980
without evidence.

392
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,740
We'll find out the truth soon enough.

393
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,020
Mr. Su, please come with us.

394
00:19:21,444 --> 00:19:23,220
Who are you trying
to call for help, huh?

395
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,700
I demand to see Mr. Li!

396
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,100
Take them away!

397
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,620
Yes, sir!

398
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,990
- I want to see Mr. Li!
- Move it!

399
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,340
Let me see him!

400
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,777
- What are you doing?
- Why are you arresting them?

401
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,933
This is injustice!

402
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,300
So?

403
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,260
You've all looked over

404
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,933
the investment contracts?

405
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,140
Any objections?

406
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,700
Still no sign of Mr. Su.

407
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,260
How can that be? Keep looking.

408
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:52,800
Yes, Sir.

409
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,660
No need to wait.

410
00:19:55,688 --> 00:19:57,288
Su Liang won't be showing up.

411
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,440
He got greedy and overreached.

412
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,060
Don't be like him.

413
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,220
He passed on a golden opportunity,

414
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,460
and now he shattered

415
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,400
his own rice bowl.

416
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,800
The litchi shipment project

417
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,060
has dragged on long enough.

418
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,410
You've all been waiting

419
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,340
and wavering.

420
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:20,940
Now,

421
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,060
it's time to decide.

422
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,680
With the Litchi Fund purchased,

423
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,140
everything is settled.

424
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,460
If you're ready,

425
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,410
then sign.

426
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,660
(Inspector's Office)

427
00:21:01,355 --> 00:21:02,340
Chief Scribe Zhao,

428
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,530
Inspector He has asked to see you

429
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,060
in the back.

430
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,666
All right.

431
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:48,980
Sir,

432
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,220
what happened?

433
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,022
I've worked for you for ten years.

434
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,820
I've never seen you like this.

435
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,177
I've done some digging.

436
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,340
Inspector Yu isn't simple.

437
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,920
He didn't come here

438
00:22:11,844 --> 00:22:14,600
just to help with the litchi shipment.

439
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,700
He's after me.

440
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,860
Do you think
the Right Chancellor is behind this?

441
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,440
If I go down,

442
00:22:32,533 --> 00:22:33,933
you won't make it out either.

443
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,650
Take your family

444
00:22:38,222 --> 00:22:38,900
and run.

445
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,060
Sir,

446
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,860
I'm not afraid of dying.

447
00:22:56,866 --> 00:22:59,044
Back then,
I had talent but no opportunity.

448
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,980
In Lingnan, life was so difficult.

449
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,740
I had lofty ambitions.

450
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,860
But I had no chance to prove myself.

451
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,300
You gave me that opportunity.

452
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,180
For that, I'm truly grateful

453
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,288
for the trust you have in me.

454
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:15,444
I'm willing to give my life to repay it.

455
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,620
You've followed me for so long.

456
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,100
I don't want to drag you down with me.

457
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,610
Listen.

458
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,511
If you don't leave now,

459
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,260
it will be too late.

460
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,940
I'll stand with you to the end.

461
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:33,088
If it comes to a showdown
with Inspector Yu, I'm ready.

462
00:23:40,088 --> 00:23:42,100
Good!

463
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,740
After years of mentoring

464
00:23:45,888 --> 00:23:47,688
and supporting you, it's all worth it!

465
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:51,780
I was messing with you.

466
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,688
That useless Inspector Yu?

467
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,110
I have never

468
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,340
taken him seriously.

469
00:23:59,911 --> 00:24:01,440
I could crush him any time!

470
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,700
I called you here

471
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,644
to tell you something huge.

472
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,450
Last night, I had a dream.

473
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,700
An immortal appeared before me

474
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,700
and said

475
00:24:15,444 --> 00:24:17,022
that my appearance resembled

476
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,540
that of the Emperor himself.

477
00:24:21,422 --> 00:24:22,733
What do you think about that?

478
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,230
An immortal?

479
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,160
If that's what the immortal said,
it must be true.

480
00:24:35,177 --> 00:24:36,355
Now that you mention it,

481
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,540
you really

482
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,260
do look

483
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,900
a bit like the Emperor.

484
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:50,933
I am

485
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,660
god!

486
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,780
If what the immortal said

487
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,860
is real,

488
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,020
then what am I doing wasting away

489
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,600
being the Right Chancellor's watchdog
in Lingnan?

490
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,940
Isn't that a bit of a waste
of my talent?

491
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,820
Zhao,

492
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,080
I want to show you something.

493
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,260
Come.

494
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,800
Take a look.

495
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,860
(Chang'an.
Jiangnan Circuit. Lingnan Circuit.)

496
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,060
"Cold rain falls across the river
into Wu.

497
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,888
At dawn, I send my friend off,
the lonely Chu hills in view.

498
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,560
Tell those back home in Luoyang

499
00:25:47,977 --> 00:25:51,020
that my conscience is clear."

500
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,660
Have you heard of this poem?

501
00:25:57,488 --> 00:25:59,222
It's by Wang Changling.

502
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,220
He wrote it after being exiled
to Jiangning.

503
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,000
That phrase "my conscience is clear?"

504
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,180
He meant that even in hardship,

505
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,580
his conscience stayed pure.

506
00:26:08,622 --> 00:26:10,690
But it was also a subtle complaint
about the Emperor

507
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,710
for pretending to care
but doing nothing.

508
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,820
Isn't this just saying

509
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,177
that His Majesty can't tell
loyal ministers from traitors?

510
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,090
But what is the reality?

511
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,180
Take a closer look.

512
00:26:24,422 --> 00:26:25,970
Can you see this pot of melted ice?

513
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,650
Every drop that flows out

514
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,911
(Jiangnan Circuit)
is a connection, a favor and a pledge

515
00:26:29,911 --> 00:26:32,020
of loyalty to someone powerful.

516
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,980
I've been loyal
to the Right Chancellor for years.

517
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,540
Yet he's always kept me under his thumb.

518
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,622
Now he sends in a eunuch?

519
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,780
That's kicking me to the curb.

520
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,580
Zhao,

521
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,610
you're a brilliant man

522
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,050
with strong support.

523
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,460
You're a talented man.

524
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,340
Now, the time has arrived.

525
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,050
Why not rise up with me

526
00:26:56,422 --> 00:26:58,260
and make a name for yourself?

527
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,060
I've been acting like a fool

528
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,000
as an Inspector for ten years.

529
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,390
Do you think I really care

530
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,090
about litchis and tribute?

531
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,844
I've been close
with that noble from Fanyang for years.

532
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,020
All these years,

533
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,940
we've been waiting

534
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,555
and planning all the time.

535
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,340
Out at sea,

536
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,280
my old pirate crews

537
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,780
can easily guard

538
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,660
the merchant ships.

539
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,540
Why would I need the navy?

540
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,820
It was because I needed an excuse

541
00:27:32,155 --> 00:27:34,580
to get the Right Chancellor
to give me the military tally.

542
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,000
With it, I can replace

543
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,320
the entire naval command

544
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,888
(Huainan Circuit)
with my own men.

545
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,990
It was all

546
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,940
to gain control of the navy.

547
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:42,700
And

548
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,900
why do you think
I've been running merchant guilds,

549
00:27:46,177 --> 00:27:48,580
stockpiling wealth
and supplies for years?

550
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,820
It was to prepare for something big.

551
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,640
As for

552
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,740
that so-called Litchi Envoy,

553
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,940
why did I block his delivery
to Chang'an?

554
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,540
Because I knew

555
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,940
that would bring too many outsiders
into Lingnan.

556
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,620
They'd ruin everything I've worked for.

557
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,333
Now, with Fanyang ready to rise.

558
00:28:09,444 --> 00:28:11,444
The whole country is about to fall
into chaos.

559
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,022
In that chaos, I will rise with it.

560
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,660
Zhao,

561
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,850
I started as a pirate.

562
00:28:20,044 --> 00:28:21,644
We survive on robbing people.

563
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,220
I took ships

564
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,140
and took crews.

565
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,380
When I came ashore, I kept taking.

566
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,880
That's how I get to sit

567
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,180
in this position.

568
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,460
I've waited, endured,

569
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,022
and planned for ten years.

570
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,820
I still want to take.

571
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,911
This time, I want to be Lingnan's ruler!

572
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,222
Back then,
Emperor Taizong conquered the land

573
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,777
with just a hundred men.

574
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,180
Look at what we have now?

575
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,140
We have troops,

576
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,340
provisions,

577
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,140
and wealth.

578
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,940
Everything's ready,
and the time is right.

579
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,580
Our first step, we will trap the enemy
so they can't escape.

580
00:28:59,088 --> 00:29:00,066
Zhao.

581
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,340
If you stand with me,

582
00:29:04,266 --> 00:29:06,688
that gives me the human support I need.

583
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,666
I swear to follow you to the death.

584
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,700
I'll give my life for your cause
without hesitation.

585
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,660
Great!

586
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:36,620
(Inspector's Office)

587
00:30:03,688 --> 00:30:04,844
My dear.

588
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,290
Did something happen?

589
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,530
He Youguang

590
00:30:14,466 --> 00:30:16,250
finally came clean with me today.

591
00:30:19,466 --> 00:30:20,844
He really wants to rebel?

592
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,060
I've already prepared

593
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,340
food and water

594
00:30:33,377 --> 00:30:34,911
at the place I told you about.

595
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,740
Don't worry.

596
00:30:39,511 --> 00:30:41,222
I'll come for you in just a few days.

597
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,420
I'm not going.

598
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,980
I'll go wherever you go.

599
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,790
But we have agreed on this.

600
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,580
Only when you're safe

601
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,220
that I can focus on

602
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,220
this crisis.

603
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,430
If things don't go well...

604
00:31:14,177 --> 00:31:15,333
I'll wait for you.

605
00:31:20,688 --> 00:31:22,222
We'll all be waiting for you.

606
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,520
I was going

607
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,590
to cook something nice

608
00:31:33,711 --> 00:31:35,488
and share some good news with you today.

609
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,370
I'm pregnant.

610
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,730
When did you find out?

611
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,260
A few days ago,

612
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,660
I went to the temple to pray.

613
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,140
The priest who read my fortune said

614
00:32:01,355 --> 00:32:03,844
I showed signs of great blessings
and a child to come.

615
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,400
I'm not exactly young anymore.

616
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,980
So I took it as a polite remark.

617
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,460
My dear.

618
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:14,500
But after you left today,

619
00:32:14,955 --> 00:32:16,220
I suddenly felt nauseated.

620
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,220
I remembered the priest's words

621
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,200
and went to the physician.

622
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,220
It turns out...

623
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,850
All these years,

624
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,440
I never imagined that you'd give

625
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,088
the Zhao family an heir.

626
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:41,980
Don't worry.

627
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,670
I'll keep both you and the baby safe.

628
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:11,940
Inspector Yu,

629
00:33:12,177 --> 00:33:14,733
Chief Scribe Zhao from
Inspector's Office, requests to see you.

630
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,620
He says

631
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,240
he's not here on behalf

632
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,550
of Inspector He.

633
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:21,311
He's here to speak for himself.

634
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,790
Just the man I wanted to see,

635
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,860
and here he is.

636
00:33:27,155 --> 00:33:28,911
He's been pushed out front
by He Youguang

637
00:33:28,955 --> 00:33:30,177
to fix the situation.

638
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,220
He must have realized

639
00:33:31,222 --> 00:33:32,600
that blind loyalty gets him nowhere.

640
00:33:32,755 --> 00:33:34,380
It looks like
he's smart enough to adapt.

641
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,020
It's been peaceful lately,

642
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,940
and I've had this lovely bird he gave me

643
00:33:43,444 --> 00:33:44,780
to keep me company.

644
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,060
Let him in.

645
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,390
Invite him in.

646
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,311
Yes, Sir.

647
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,260
Mr. Li! Mr. Li...

648
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,530
Mr. Li.

649
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:07,690
Mr. Li, you have a visitor.

650
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,977
When the litchis are sold out,
we can go to Chang'an.

651
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,000
Inspector Yu requests your presence.

652
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,090
He says it's urgent.

653
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,040
Is it about Mr. Su?

654
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,540
Mr. Su is arrested

655
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,080
by the Inspector's Office.

656
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,100
What?

657
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,100
Inspector Yu.

658
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,460
Inspector Yu.

659
00:34:27,288 --> 00:34:28,070
Chief Scribe Zhao?

660
00:34:28,688 --> 00:34:29,360
What's going on?

661
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,300
Why was Mr. Su arrested?

662
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,120
Mr. Li, calm down.

663
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,888
This was all He Youguang's doing.

664
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,360
What?

665
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,780
He's delaying the litchi shipment!

666
00:34:35,822 --> 00:34:37,533
I'm reporting this
to the Right Chancellor.

667
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,340
Mr. Li,

668
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,000
don't waste your energy.

669
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,190
He Youguang

670
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,670
doesn't even fear His Majesty anymore.

671
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,460
He wouldn't dare!

672
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,900
That's treason!

673
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,520
It's precisely what he's planning to do.

674
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,100
What?

675
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,700
He's planning to rebel?

676
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,690
He already used

677
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,820
the military tally

678
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,220
to mobilize the navy.

679
00:34:56,377 --> 00:34:57,444
Once he makes his move,

680
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,700
Lingnan will be sealed off.

681
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,990
Forget about Mr. Su.

682
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,040
Even your lives

683
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,900
could be in danger.

684
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,133
As the Chief Scribe
of the Inspector's Office,

685
00:35:04,244 --> 00:35:06,080
I have a duty to protect
the people of Lingnan.

686
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,377
That's why I came to warn you.

687
00:35:07,422 --> 00:35:08,700
I ask that you

688
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:10,466
to think of a countermeasure.

689
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:12,380
Then we must get this news back

690
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,911
to Chang'an immediately.

691
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,980
Even if we send word,

692
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,190
we won't last long enough
for reinforcements to arrive.

693
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,140
Mr. Li,

694
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,020
He Youguang has already accepted
my invitation.

695
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,900
I fear he'll make his move tonight.

696
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,711
Now, we need to find a way
to save ourselves now.

697
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,900
This darn eunuch

698
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,340
has been pretending to be upright

699
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,866
since the day he arrived in Lingnan.

700
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,555
At a moment like this,
he dares to invite me?

701
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:40,760
Inspector He,

702
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:42,622
the rebellion is about to begin.

703
00:35:42,733 --> 00:35:44,644
These Chang'an officials
are liabilities.

704
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,150
Why don't I take some men

705
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,860
and finish them off?

706
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,940
You must not act recklessly.

707
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,360
He surely has set a trap.

708
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,850
Why else would he send
a dinner invitation?

709
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,500
The navy lands today.

710
00:35:59,577 --> 00:36:01,160
Once we have full control of the troops,

711
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,511
it won't be too late when we strike.

712
00:36:02,511 --> 00:36:04,288
Until then,
Chief Scribe Zhao and I will work

713
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,111
from inside the city
to turn things around.

714
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,577
Mr. Li, you have the Right Chancellor's
silver token.

715
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,260
When the navy lands,

716
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,244
find ways to stall them
as long as you can.

717
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,620
But the dinner is a trap.

718
00:36:18,755 --> 00:36:20,620
If you go, you could die.

719
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,780
Captain Yang,

720
00:36:22,955 --> 00:36:24,622
take the men and lock down the city.

721
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:25,660
Tonight,

722
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,940
no one or no news

723
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,900
shall get out of Lingnan.

724
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,300
Yes, Sir.

725
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:33,577
I'm a subject of the Tang Dynasty.

726
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,900
I may not be whole.

727
00:36:36,422 --> 00:36:37,711
When the greater good calls,

728
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,580
how much

729
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,660
is my life worth anyway?

730
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,320
Mr. Li,

731
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,977
leave at once.

732
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,900
If things go wrong

733
00:36:45,644 --> 00:36:47,644
and I die
by He Youguang's hands tonight,

734
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,340
Chief Scribe Zhao will send word to you.

735
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,350
Then head to the city gates
and return to Chang'an

736
00:36:52,355 --> 00:36:54,133
to report everything
to the Right Chancellor.

737
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,060
The city is on lockdown.

738
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,770
It seems Inspector He

739
00:36:58,770 --> 00:36:59,911
is determined

740
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,820
to all-out war with us.

741
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,670
Forgive me.

742
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,488
I shouldn't speak so freely.

743
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,911
No need to hold back.

744
00:37:25,488 --> 00:37:27,311
A minnow crossing the river
is still a fish.

745
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,177
So is the prized koi in the lake.

746
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,920
And even the mighty kun in the sea
is still a fish.

747
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,860
I am a fish

748
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:37,266
that he cannot easily catch.

749
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,300
Inspector's Office orders!
Anti-pirate drills!

750
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,140
We sent

751
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,650
this dinner invite ourselves.

752
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,540
You knew He Youguang would rebel.

753
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,460
Why risk

754
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,140
and put yourself in danger?

755
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,780
He's connected closely

756
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,220
with the Right Chancellor.

757
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,780
If this leaks,

758
00:37:55,177 --> 00:37:56,866
it will implicate the Right Chancellor.

759
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,780
But if we hold this evidence

760
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,420
and report
to the Right Chancellor later,

761
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,133
would that not be a deed of great merit?

762
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,740
True,

763
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,230
but our odds are slim.

764
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,088
We're too few and too weak
to stand against them.

765
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,220
How can we stand up

766
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,822
to He Youguang's forces?

767
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,260
High stakes bring high rewards.

768
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,940
I've waited years

769
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,460
for this moment.

770
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,780
Even if I bet my life,

771
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,660
I must take a chance.

772
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,780
Tonight,

773
00:38:26,577 --> 00:38:27,940
we shall see who can live longer.

774
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:36,740
(Inspector's Office)

775
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,600
Zhao.

776
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,690
Once the navy lands tonight,

777
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,140
take the city guards
and go to Qifeng Pavilion.

778
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,111
Kill that eunuch.

779
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:48,690
Yes, Sir.

780
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,250
Hello, Inspector Yu.

781
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,620
Inspector He.

782
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,300
It's been days.

783
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,080
Yet I've missed you so.

784
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,260
Inspector Yu,

785
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,620
it has been quite difficult

786
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,320
to see you.

787
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,020
I feel honored.

788
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,300
Inspector He, the pleasure is mine.

789
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:55,900
Please come in.

790
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,311
After you.

791
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:57,860
No, after you.

792
00:39:57,866 --> 00:39:58,777
Please head inside.

793
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,360
You're such a busy man.

794
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,500
Thank you for making time

795
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,610
to join me tonight.

796
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,270
You're too kind.

797
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,980
Since you arrived in Lingnan,

798
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,860
I've hoped to find

799
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,100
a chance

800
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,020
to share

801
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,844
some fine local wine with you.

802
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,710
But I have no luck.

803
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,620
You've been too busy.

804
00:40:39,444 --> 00:40:41,500
Thank you for giving me
this opportunity today.

805
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,866
A toast to you!

806
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,580
Cheers!

807
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,420
Cheers.

808
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,660
I, Li Shande,
the appointed Litchi Envoy,

809
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,460
request to meet with the Admiral!

810
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,300
Please stand down your fleet and camp.

811
00:41:09,377 --> 00:41:11,180
Do not go down
a path of self-destruction!

812
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,820
Litchi Envoy?

813
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,420
A fruit seller dares

814
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,355
to order me around?

815
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,300
True, I'm the Litchi Envoy.

816
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,220
But I also carry authority

817
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,177
from the Right Chancellor
to inspect Lingnan!

818
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,620
The navy should be patrolling

819
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,900
at sea.

820
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,700
But the navy landed and gathered
without reason.

821
00:41:35,777 --> 00:41:36,990
This violates the military law.

822
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,666
I'm simply reminding you of the rules.

823
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,300
We're acting on orders.

824
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,020
Then I'll be frank.

825
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,860
He Youguang is planning to revolt.

826
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,570
The Right Chancellor
is already aware of this

827
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:48,866
and waiting for him to slip up.

828
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,620
If you press forward,

829
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,620
you better think

830
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,911
about the consequences.

831
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,660
You don't stand a chance.

832
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,888
You say He Youguang is rebelling.

833
00:41:57,911 --> 00:41:58,755
Do you have proof?

834
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,420
Admiral,

835
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,580
if you take even half a step

836
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,660
toward Lingnan,

837
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,911
it means your heart is set on rebellion.

838
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,955
There's no turning back
after one wrong move.

839
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,111
We answer only to orders issued

840
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,644
by the military tally.

841
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:15,940
Admiral,

842
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,933
please reconsider.

843
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,300
We have yet to meet Inspector He.

844
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,060
Why believe only his side of the story?

845
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,740
Just follow the order.

846
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,755
I'll take full responsibility
for whatever comes.

847
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,820
=The Litchi Road=

848
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,280
The Right Chancellor
gave me some advice.

849
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,380
"Strike while you have the upper hand."

850
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,900
When I arrived in Lingnan,

851
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,850
I finally understood
what he really meant.

852
00:42:48,022 --> 00:42:49,044
Chief Scribe Zhao,

853
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,060
your time is running out.

854
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,080
You need to act quickly.

855
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,580
Zhao!

856
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,420
Arrest this eunuch!

857
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,577
Get him! Beat him!

858
00:43:04,577 --> 00:43:06,911
