00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,999
=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,044 --> 00:01:41,577
(Osmanthus of the Old Mansion: One)
Though this house is small,

3
00:01:41,577 --> 00:01:42,690
it has all the cozy details.

4
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,610
Great airflow

5
00:01:43,644 --> 00:01:44,330
all around.

6
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:46,020
There's even a canal right nearby.

7
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,580
Fetching water or doing laundry

8
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,020
will be easy.

9
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,580
(Jinniang)

10
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,390
It's all fixed up already?

11
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:05,866
(Li Xiu'er, One Month Old)
That's the screen we picked.

12
00:02:07,955 --> 00:02:08,930
This study

13
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,980
is so spacious.

14
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,810
We can place a zither table here later.

15
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,860
You can play right here.

16
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,260
We passed Yong'an Canal earlier.

17
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,180
It'll be easy to wash clothes there.

18
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,210
And in summer,

19
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,980
we can fetch water to bathe Xiu'er.

20
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,370
See this threshold?

21
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,650
It's removable.

22
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,020
It'll help Xiu'er

23
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:31,860
learn to walk.

24
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,140
Right.

25
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,420
Dear...

26
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,330
Don't you think...

27
00:02:40,977 --> 00:02:42,650
this smell is familiar?

28
00:02:43,177 --> 00:02:44,511
Like I knew it from somewhere.

29
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,080
Smell this.

30
00:02:54,777 --> 00:02:55,930
It's Xiu'er's scent.

31
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,490
It's sweet.

32
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,540
Very sweet.

33
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,890
Osmanthus represents success.

34
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,190
It means being helped by someone noble.

35
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:09,540
Wonderful.

36
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,650
To me,

37
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,610
you're just like that tree.

38
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,210
Always upright.

39
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,650
I want to pick osmanthus

40
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,020
to wish for luck and happiness.

41
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,740
I hope the three of us

42
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,050
can live in peace

43
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:22,860
and harmony.

44
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,770
I want a simple, quiet life.

45
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,020
Yes.

46
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,260
The three of us...

47
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:29,980
Safe and together.

48
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,111
That matters most.

49
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:33,770
One day,

50
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:35,090
when Xiu'er grows up,

51
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,890
we'll...

52
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,020
go out for spring picnics,

53
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,140
cool off by the stream in summer,

54
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,020
sit under the tree
and watch the moon in fall...

55
00:03:44,177 --> 00:03:45,020
(And in winter,)

56
00:03:45,022 --> 00:03:46,111
(we sit by the fire.)

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,230
(Spirit tablet of beloved wife,
Zheng Jinniang of Xingyang)

58
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,060
=Episode 2=

59
00:04:44,244 --> 00:04:46,533
(Bureau of Agriculture)

60
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,680
What are you doing?

61
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,390
Qilang!

62
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,750
Run, Qilang!

63
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,580
Qilang, run!

64
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,220
Kneel!

65
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,190
Don't take my Qilang!

66
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:58,460
Kneel!

67
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,420
Let go of Gou'er!

68
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,150
Don't take Qilang!

69
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,540
Let Gou'er go!

70
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,070
Let him go!

71
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,270
Mr. Lu! Mr. Lu!

72
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,710
I did it. I'll take the blame.

73
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,420
Mr. Lu!

74
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,420
Let Gou'er go.

75
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,920
He's still just a kid.

76
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,390
Qilang!

77
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,150
It's come to this.

78
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,660
You shall atone for your death.

79
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,460
I got a copper tube yesterday

80
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,710
from the Right Chancellor's envoy.

81
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,460
Please take a look, Mr. Lu.

82
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,630
Shame he's already dead.

83
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,550
All we have is the evidence.

84
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,510
No way

85
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,590
to prove collusion.

86
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,630
Mr. Lu.

87
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,510
Did you keep this quiet?

88
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,010
Of course.

89
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,550
Then, it's easy to deal with it.

90
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,410
There's still room to turn this around.

91
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,370
Yesterday I overheard
Right Chancellor's envoy.

92
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,020
He wanted to deliver
the military tally to Lingnan.

93
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,680
Now that he's dead,

94
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,860
I can impersonate him

95
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,780
and get close to He Youguang.

96
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,390
With evidence, we can
take Right Chancellor down.

97
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,790
That'll help Left Chancellor.

98
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,420
If I fail,

99
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,660
I'm not a government official.

100
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,630
It won't trace back to him.

101
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,660
Deputy Director Lu,
please let me do this.

102
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,170
Let me make it right.

103
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,440
But Pan Bao...

104
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,920
He has seen Right Chancellor's envoy.

105
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,200
If he returns to Lingnan,

106
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,370
what then?

107
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,250
Before I leave,

108
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,230
I'll get rid of him.

109
00:07:08,977 --> 00:07:10,730
(Pan Bao came to the capital)

110
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,660
(to offer)

111
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,830
(rare tree saplings to His Majesty.)

112
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,080
(Today,)

113
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,290
(he'll be at Leyou Garden.)

114
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,640
I'm Pan Bao,

115
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,170
sent by the Inspector of Gaozhou,

116
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,300
offering sacred trees.

117
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,760
But Leyou Garden

118
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,290
is a royal garden.

119
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:27,490
How

120
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,520
will you get inside?

121
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,100
Don't worry, Deputy Director Lu.

122
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,170
All I need is a pass

123
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,390
from the Shanglin Office.

124
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,430
Everything else...

125
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,520
(will be taken care of.)

126
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,630
State your business.

127
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,520
We're colleagues of Mr. Li,

128
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,990
from the Shanglin Office.

129
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:46,910
He said

130
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,070
some rare trees

131
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,390
from Lingnan just arrived.

132
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,620
He's swamped,

133
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:51,866
so he sent us to help.

134
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,270
Which Mr. Li?

135
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,310
Li Shande.

136
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,580
You know,

137
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,900
he has a big head,

138
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,510
but he is very timid.

139
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,460
He's always mumbling

140
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,190
at the plants.

141
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,580
“Peony, you're prettier than any girl.”

142
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,750
Yeah, that's him.

143
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,830
If I fail again,

144
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,190
I'll die

145
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,150
for the greater good.

146
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,980
Deputy Director Lu,

147
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,710
please grant me this.

148
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,900
I'll trust you one more time.

149
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,630
This spot's on Pan Bao's path.

150
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,020
Once he shows up,

151
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,990
you strike.

152
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,270
We do it?

153
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,940
Of course.

154
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,660
I'll distract him.

155
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,110
When it's time to move,

156
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,470
make it quick and quiet.

157
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,150
It has to look like an accident.

158
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,540
Got it?

159
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,230
Got it.

160
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,180
Mr. Li?

161
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,020
Why are you here?

162
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:12,940
Didn't you

163
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,700
send someone here?

164
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,150
Shanglin Office?

165
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,270
No,

166
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,680
it's something else.

167
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,060
Is there an attendant
named Yu Cheng'en inside?

168
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,750
Yeah.

169
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,110
He's in the hothouse.

170
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,510
Thanks.

171
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,300
Attendant Yu.

172
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,820
Li Shande, Shanglin Office.

173
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,060
Greetings, Attendant Yu.

174
00:09:39,311 --> 00:09:40,940
(Attendant Yu Cheng'en)

175
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,510
From the Shanglin Office, huh?

176
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,470
You here to help plant trees too?

177
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,510
Yes.

178
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,630
Then tell me,

179
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,350
what tree is this?

180
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,350
I...

181
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,990
That's the small
persimmon tree from Lingnan.

182
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,020
Also called "blackwood".

183
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,270
Great for potted planting.

184
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,340
When planting,

185
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,940
it prefers wet and dry extremes.

186
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,340
Not bad.

187
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,820
This was offered
by the Inspector of Gaozhou.

188
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,130
When it's being replanted,

189
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,370
regulations say

190
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,190
someone from the palace
must be present.

191
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,540
So today, I arranged

192
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,970
for the Lingnan envoy to come.

193
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,770
If you know your stuff,

194
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,940
that would be ideal.

195
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,650
Yes, Sir.

196
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:25,970
Attendant Yu,

197
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,370
I came today

198
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,460
bearing some questions.

199
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,940
I heard a few days ago

200
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,340
you received

201
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,010
a decree from His Majesty.

202
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:37,970
It said

203
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,490
he wanted fresh litchis.

204
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:41,890
Why

205
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,850
do you ask?

206
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,970
I'm with the Shanglin Office.

207
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,010
We handle fruits and crops too.

208
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,700
Actually,

209
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,580
I've been assigned to the litchi job.

210
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,770
So I wanted to ask how it started

211
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,060
so it's easier to handle it.

212
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,580
So you're the one

213
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,220
unlucky Litchi Envoy.

214
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,100
Honestly,

215
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,420
there's not much to tell.

216
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,180
His Majesty just wanted fresh litchis,

217
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,130
so he sent a Litchi Envoy

218
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,340
to go fetch some.

219
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:14,890
That's all.

220
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,700
So, His Majesty

221
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,180
really wants fresh litchis?

222
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,100
Not the ones

223
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,130
preserved in honey?

224
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,610
They have plenty of preserved litchis
in the palace.

225
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,940
Why would they send someone like you

226
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,300
just to go buy more?

227
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,650
But...

228
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,100
fresh litchis

229
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,460
go bad in three days.

230
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,540
It's that fast.

231
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,970
Did no one tell His Majesty that?

232
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,850
His words carry the weight of Heaven.

233
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,610
Whatever he says,

234
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,580
we officials

235
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,100
should just obey.

236
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,940
You want to remind him?

237
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:51,700
What, do you think

238
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,880
you're smarter than him?

239
00:11:54,222 --> 00:11:54,977
No.

240
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,610
If His Majesty wants fresh litchis,

241
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,820
then give him fresh litchis.

242
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,730
Whether you can actually deliver them,

243
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,610
that's your problem,

244
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,460
Litchi Envoy.

245
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,060
But we really can't deliver them.

246
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,010
This is harder than Xuanzang's

247
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,610
journey to the West.

248
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,700
If it truly can't be done,

249
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,180
you'll have to die for it.

250
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,420
I'm not

251
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,610
being cruel or sarcastic.

252
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,730
Just speaking the truth.

253
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,610
If you die,

254
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,700
the task ends.

255
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,420
That's how it goes.

256
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,820
That is

257
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:38,940
how the world operates.

258
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,130
Pan Bao?

259
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,370
Do I know you?

260
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,490
I know you.

261
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,370
I know you and Right Chancellor.

262
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,100
The man you met yesterday died.

263
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,430
Don't believe me?

264
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,210
Do you know him?

265
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,180
Right Chancellor is furious.

266
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,650
He thinks it was a setup.

267
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,700
What do you know about that fire?

268
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:21,850
I...

269
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,010
I'd never set a fire!

270
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,660
Let's talk elsewhere.

271
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,890
What happened?

272
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,770
Come on!

273
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:44,700
Wake up!

274
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:45,970
Wake up!

275
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,180
Wake up!

276
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,700
Someone!

277
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:52,890
Help!

278
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,700
Why is he back under again?

279
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,180
I just

280
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,300
pulled him up.

281
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,060
You are already

282
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,820
a dead man walking.

283
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,580
And you're still saving others?

284
00:16:20,755 --> 00:16:21,820
Liangyuan.

285
00:16:24,822 --> 00:16:26,380
(Zimei)
(Han Shisi)

286
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:27,820
Shisi?

287
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:29,580
Zimei?

288
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:31,650
Come.

289
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,580
Liangyuan,

290
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,060
you may not know this.

291
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,340
The Ministry of Personnel had assigned

292
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,830
Zimei to be County Officer of Hexi.

293
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,220
But he turned it down.

294
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,970
So they gave him another post.

295
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,700
Staff Officer of
the Right Guard Command.

296
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,970
It may be a low-profile post,

297
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,490
but it's still a capital appointment.

298
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,850
His Majesty appreciates
poetry and literature.

299
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,130
If Zimei stays in Chang'an,

300
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,540
his day will come.

301
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,060
The post wasn't my choice.

302
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,080
I took it for a few bushels of grain.

303
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,850
Otherwise, my family would starve.

304
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,170
Mr. Wuliu could
keep his back straight,

305
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,980
but I'm nowhere
near as noble as the sages.

306
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,540
Come on now, no more of that talk.

307
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,820
You served at
the Academy of Literary Studies.

308
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,300
You're not like us petty office workers.

309
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,500
Liangyuan.

310
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,610
What is it?

311
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,170
That's completely absurd.

312
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,890
Lingnan is far,
and litchis spoil easily.

313
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,210
None of that can be helped.

314
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,060
Surely...

315
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,130
Someone must have told His Majesty?

316
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,690
His words are law.

317
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,890
Once he gives an order,

318
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,890
who dares to say no?

319
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,020
All the ministries
would rather pass it down

320
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,890
than have one of them

321
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,610
suggest taking it back.

322
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,740
His Majesty

323
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,690
is a once-in-a-generation ruler.

324
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,260
But sadly...

325
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,210
He is too clever to take advice,

326
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,930
too eloquent to admit fault.

327
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,370
Once a decree is issued,
it can't be undone.

328
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:53,780
The best plan

329
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,340
is to find a scapegoat

330
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,450
to take the job.

331
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,100
If it fails,

332
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,340
he dies.

333
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,500
All is well in the world.

334
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,570
Liangyuan, ever played
pass-the-flower with drums?

335
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,890
You're the one holding the flower

336
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,930
when the drumbeat stops.

337
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,610
Shisi.

338
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,260
If you're right,

339
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,580
then I have no way out.

340
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,020
I just...

341
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,100
I borrowed 150 guan

342
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,450
from Pingkang Ward.

343
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,410
A benevolence loan.

344
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,100
I don't care if I die.

345
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,260
But I worry Xiu'er

346
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,660
might be sold as a slave.

347
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,930
That child...

348
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,130
She's moved house
with me since she was little.

349
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,610
After all that,

350
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,120
just as it got better,

351
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,500
before we got to enjoy it,

352
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,370
she might be dragged into all this.

353
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,130
You think I don't get it?

354
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,020
My wife and kid are back in Fengxian.

355
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,610
They're starving and worrying every day.

356
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,260
I think about them all the time.

357
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,170
But if I leave Chang'an...

358
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:07,930
Zimei,

359
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,460
don't make this worse.

360
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,500
Liangyuan.

361
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,650
Did you notice

362
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,170
the deadline on the decree?

363
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:31,450
It's the first day of June.

364
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,980
You really don't see what that means?

365
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,370
The Noble Consort?

366
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,850
That day

367
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,260
is her birthday.

368
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,580
So the fresh litchis

369
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,980
are a birthday gift

370
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,980
from His Majesty.

371
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,170
If it's really for her birthday,

372
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,020
then this matters even more

373
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,780
than anything His Majesty

374
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,690
wants for himself.

375
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,610
It's a major event.

376
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,540
No one would dare get in the way.

377
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,690
But what happens after that day?

378
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,500
Settle the kid somewhere safe.

379
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,260
Leave her with someone you trust.

380
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,500
Another piece of tofu.

381
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:43,410
Here.

382
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,130
Let's eat.

383
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,370
This is such a feast, Father.

384
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,130
It is.

385
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,980
We're celebrating today.

386
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:51,450
I have

387
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,060
some good news to tell you.

388
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,130
What is it?

389
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,890
Your legs.

390
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,350
Sit like a lady, will you?

391
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,450
The first piece of good news

392
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,300
is that

393
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:06,890
I bought back

394
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,500
our old house.

395
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,770
From now on, you won't
have to move around with me,

396
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,410
renting places here and there.

397
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:14,540
Really?

398
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:15,850
Really.

399
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:16,540
Father,

400
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,820
when can we move back?

401
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,340
Not just yet.

402
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,020
There's another piece of good news.

403
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,690
This time,

404
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,080
I saved the peony, remember?

405
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,260
It's a big feat.

406
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,100
His Majesty was impressed.

407
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,060
He gave me a big job.

408
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,060
His Majesty said

409
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,130
he's sending me

410
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,300
on an even bigger,
more important mission.

411
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,260
I'll have to travel far for it.

412
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,930
Only you can handle this job?

413
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,540
That's right.

414
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,340
Out of everyone at Shanglin Office,

415
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,300
only I can do it.

416
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,100
Can you

417
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,260
take me with you, Father?

418
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,980
I need to stay focused on the job

419
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,410
so I can come back fast.

420
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,780
Right?

421
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,170
So,

422
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,890
stay with your uncle

423
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,020
for a little while.

424
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:07,300
When I'm back,

425
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,550
we'll move into the house.

426
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,780
But you always break your promises,

427
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,740
Father.

428
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,740
This time,

429
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,610
I swear I won't.

430
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:43,980
Here.

431
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,980
Take this money.

432
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,780
It's not enough for luxuries,

433
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,450
but it'll cover you for a while.

434
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,780
I've already updated your registry.

435
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,410
From now on,

436
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,690
you're a free person.

437
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,500
Take it, and take the money.

438
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,340
Leave here.

439
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,030
I won't.

440
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,300
Even if I'm a servant,

441
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,500
I've stayed by your side
since I was little.

442
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,980
Even when you were

443
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,340
cast out of the Zheng clan,

444
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,060
and all the servants left,

445
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,410
I never once thought

446
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,370
about leaving you.

447
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:27,740
Now,

448
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,890
I ask that you let me stay.

449
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,580
Things are different now, Gou'er.

450
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,130
This journey to Lingnan

451
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,210
is a death trap.

452
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,300
If you come with me,

453
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,020
you're just throwing your life away.

454
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,370
I may be lowborn,

455
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,130
and I never had much education,

456
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,500
but I know what it means to be grateful.

457
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,210
You named me Gou'er for a reason.

458
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,340
You wanted me to remember

459
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,170
not to be ashamed of my roots,

460
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,780
and to stay loyal and righteous.

461
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,450
All these years,

462
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,650
you've treated me like family.

463
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,820
If I leave you now,

464
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,930
I won't have anyone left.

465
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,300
I won't have a home.

466
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,690
For the rest of my life,

467
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,580
I'll follow you to the end, Qilang.

468
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,930
I'll stay by your side.

469
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,890
I'll protect you with my life.

470
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,210
I swear it with my blood.

471
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,450
You fool.

472
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,650
Swear with your blood?

473
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,690
You're just a kid.

474
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,650
You won't even survive this.

475
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,020
Get out.

476
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,850
I'm not afraid to die!

477
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,210
Qilang,

478
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,780
please don't send me away.

479
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,610
Please don't send me away.

480
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,420
(For the late Zheng of Xingyang
and Madam Zhang of the Zheng clan)

481
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:15,980
Tell me,

482
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,130
can I ever return to the Zheng clan?

483
00:26:23,644 --> 00:26:31,000
(For the late Zheng of Xingyang
and Madam Zhang of the Zheng clan)

484
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:57,930
(Written Pledge)

485
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:58,930
(My child,)

486
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,630
(even if it costs me my life,
I'll make sure)

487
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,300
(this house of ours stays yours.)

488
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:11,650
Even after I'm gone,

489
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,580
you'll still have a place to call home.

490
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,500
(Li Xiu'er)

491
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:25,820
♪Resting on the branches
of my past hometown♪

492
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,500
♪Drifting clouds
lift the hem of my robe♪

493
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,460
♪The wind tonight
carries the scent of osmanthus♪

494
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,700
♪The mountains whisper,
and the road winds on♪

495
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:49,140
♪When will I see the fireworks again♪

496
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,300
♪Like chasing shadows in the wind♪

497
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:58,180
♪I cross back and forth
over the bridge of fate♪

498
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,580
♪As the sun rises and the moon sets♪

499
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:10,700
♪This longing won't let go♪

500
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:16,311
(This girl of the Li family
is named Xiu'er.)

501
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,850
(Intelligent and kind, pure in heart.)

502
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,690
(I care for her dearly.)

503
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,850
(Now I entrust my beloved daughter to)

504
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,590
(my wife's younger brother,
Zheng Ping'an.)

505
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:31,340
(All property left by Li Shande)

506
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:33,190
(including the house,
land, and valuables)

507
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,170
(shall belong to Xiu'er alone.)

508
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,580
(May Heaven above help her)

509
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,370
(and Earth below protect her.)

510
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,100
(May she grow up safe and sound,)

511
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:45,320
(with wealth, peace, and good fortune.)

512
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,340
(Signed by the adoptive father,
Li Shande.)

513
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,080
You're here, Gou'er.

514
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,020
Morning, Granny Wang.

515
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:57,850
Morning.

516
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:08,340
I'm here.

517
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,170
Gou'er.

518
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:13,980
Mr. Li.

519
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,260
My master Qilang said

520
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,010
he wants her to stay with you for now.

521
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,020
I was about to go to him.

522
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,630
I need to head out for a while.

523
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,300
Xiu'er might have to stay
at her uncle's for some time.

524
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,650
Qilang is leaving here too.

525
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,260
Don't know when he'll be back.

526
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,410
Goodbye.

527
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:34,610
Gou'er! Gou'er!

528
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:35,820
Wait!

529
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,260
Where is he going?

530
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,830
When is he coming back?

531
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,410
I don't know.

532
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,210
Farewell, Mr. Li.

533
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,260
Gou'er!

534
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,450
Come back, Gou'er!

535
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,340
Mr. Li.

536
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,210
If Ping'an gets back first,

537
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,450
tell him to pick up

538
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,990
Xiu'er from the embroidery shop.

539
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,450
Got it.

540
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:56,980
Got it?

541
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,610
Got it.

542
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,100
Got it?

543
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,340
Yes!

544
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,540
Don't forget to come get me.

545
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:12,580
I won't forget.

546
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,370
Alley Master.

547
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,100
Mr. Li.

548
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,820
Congratulations.

549
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,890
May your fortune never end.

550
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,450
Look at that.

551
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,370
You became a Litchi Envoy

552
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,020
as soon as you bought a house.

553
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,610
Words travel fast.

554
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,020
Madam Shiqi said

555
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,210
she heard you're leaving.

556
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:54,690
She wanted me

557
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,300
to offer you some help

558
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,630
with this business of yours.

559
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:58,890
Just think about it.

560
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,060
See how you can

561
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,370
lose less merit,

562
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,970
and gain more blessings.

563
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,300
I've been appointed
Litchi Envoy by His Majesty.

564
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,210
I carry the order.

565
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:13,980
I'll head south soon

566
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,010
and return in June.

567
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,020
Once I'm back in June,

568
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,950
I'll pay you.

569
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,100
I get what you're saying.

570
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,060
Basically,

571
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,890
blessings and merit

572
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,260
aren't denied, just delayed.

573
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:28,740
That's what I mean.

574
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,690
But the mission for that day

575
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,820
is His Majesty's order.

576
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,500
- Not me.
- Understood.

577
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,880
- Not my decision.
- All right.

578
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,450
Seems like Madam Shiqi

579
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,740
will only feel blessed

580
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,150
if the deed's in her hands.

581
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,020
Fine then.

582
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,930
Please let me borrow
the deed temporarily.

583
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,410
The deed stays with me.

584
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,740
The debt will be

585
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,130
cleared when I return.

586
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,780
Today, Madam Shiqi told me,

587
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,780
your daughter studies here.

588
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,740
I advise you

589
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:55,820
to do more good.

590
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,060
Build more good karma.

591
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,100
You're just a servant,

592
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,580
yet you talk so brazenly!

593
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,020
Let me warn you!

594
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:01,740
If any of you

595
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,820
dares target my daughter,

596
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,780
I won't let it slide.

597
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,540
The money

598
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,690
will be paid at the Pingkang Ward today.

599
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,300
But if you keep me here,

600
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,500
you're obstructing
my duty to His Majesty.

601
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,780
And that is punishable by death!

602
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:15,410
The execution of your entire clan!
Do you get it?

603
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,430
Keep your voice down!

604
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:17,780
Do you want to stay?

605
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,020
Yes or no?

606
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,740
Let's leave.

607
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,020
Thank you.

608
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:31,340
Thank you.

609
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,580
Thank you.

610
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:38,650
Chief Liu.

611
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,820
We're out of noodles.

612
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,020
What are you here for?

613
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,410
Thank you.

614
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:46,580
I'd like...

615
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:48,170
Spill it.

616
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,170
I'm busy here.

617
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,890
I'd like to ask you

618
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:53,930
for a bit of money.

619
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,170
What money?

620
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,100
Last month's wages

621
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:01,980
were already paid.

622
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,540
Not my wages.

623
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,260
Aren't I the Litchi Envoy?

624
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,260
The trip to Lingnan

625
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,340
costs a lot.

626
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,300
The money should come
from public funds.

627
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,780
Who gave you the assignment?

628
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,740
Go ask them.

629
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:16,260
Go on.

630
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,500
Don't bother me at work.

631
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,580
Chief Liu,

632
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,980
you're the one who gave me this job.

633
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,020
You can't just walk away.

634
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,170
What nonsense is that?

635
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,980
You signed it yourself.

636
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,130
I didn't force your hand.

637
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,100
You know full well

638
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,820
I have a young daughter at home.

639
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,060
I just borrowed money to buy a house.

640
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,540
Why did you hit me this hard?

641
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,500
At least leave me a way to survive!

642
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,100
Have a heart.

643
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,500
You have to give me a chance.

644
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,820
You're talking nonsense.

645
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,260
His Majesty made you Litchi Envoy.

646
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,610
So, do your job.

647
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,540
Why are you

648
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,500
bothering me about it?

649
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,370
As the Litchi Envoy,
I must deliver them.

650
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,340
I need funding from the Shanglin Office.

651
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,570
Will you fund it or not?

652
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:02,300
The Shanglin Office
handles the royal gardens.

653
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,930
You're here begging me?

654
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,980
Is serving His Majesty called begging?

655
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:07,850
I...

656
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,130
I didn't mean that.

657
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,130
I mean...

658
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,730
This expense

659
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,020
has nothing to do with us.

660
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:14,980
You know full well

661
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,730
that these litchis can't be delivered.

662
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,900
Either way, I'm dead.

663
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,540
If I die,

664
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,810
you'll all die with me!

665
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:23,860
Wait!

666
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,060
What are you trying to say?

667
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,810
This is nonsense!

668
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,060
The litchis can't be delivered

669
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,290
because Shanglin Office is interfering!

670
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,650
It's your personal revenge!

671
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:31,580
You people

672
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,860
refuse to recognize my position!

673
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,380
You disregard His Majesty's wishes.

674
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,770
You have a problem
with Noble Consort.

675
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:36,210
Slander!

676
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,060
You deliberately want

677
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,430
to stop her from tasting litchis!

678
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:39,380
That's slander!

679
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,770
Slander?

680
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,250
You!

681
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:42,420
You there!

682
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,420
Last year, didn't you steal

683
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,740
twenty koi from Xingqing Palace

684
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:46,900
and replace them with carp?

685
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,700
Wasn't that you?

686
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,020
I...

687
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:48,810
I didn't do it!

688
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,010
You!

689
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:53,100
Didn't you let nobles from the capital

690
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,250
hunt in the royal gardens?

691
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,700
And you took bribes for it!

692
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,610
Did you do it?

693
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,290
No, I've been framed!

694
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:58,940
It's a lie!

695
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,580
Stay here!

696
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:00,420
You too!

697
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,130
You sold five pots of orchids

698
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,020
from Xingqing Palace

699
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:03,940
and took the money.

700
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,100
They all withered in the end.

701
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:05,810
Was that you?

702
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,540
You!

703
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,730
All of you have been

704
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,320
stuffing your own pockets,

705
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,540
doing nothing but dirty work.

706
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,980
Now there's no money left for me.

707
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,690
You're bullying an honest man.

708
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,810
I'm telling you!

709
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,730
A cornered rabbit

710
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,730
will bite back!

711
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,290
Today I'm going all in.

712
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,330
No money?

713
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:22,650
I'm telling you,

714
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,540
from now on,

715
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,500
If you dare utter
a single word of defiance,

716
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,770
then you're obstructing
an imperial envoy.

717
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:28,900
And you'll all die.

718
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,250
You'll die with me.

719
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,810
That's human nature.

720
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,460
This is human nature!

721
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,330
Human nature!

722
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,290
Shut up.

723
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,330
Human nature?

724
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,210
Everyone, listen up.

725
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,020
Before the first day of June,

726
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,730
you'll all do as I say.

727
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:44,690
I am the Litchi Envoy,
appointed by His Majesty himself!

728
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,380
Before the first day of June,

729
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,950
here's everything I owe you so far.

730
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,700
On the first day of June,

731
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,620
once I've brought
the litchis back to Chang'an,

732
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,730
I'll pay you the rest.

733
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:04,860
In my younger days,

734
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,860
I trusted a man who said he'd marry me.

735
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,860
He ran off with my life savings.

736
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,860
After that, I gave up on love

737
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,940
and focused only on rebuilding my life.

738
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,460
But now, I'm an aging woman.

739
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,170
I've lost my charm.

740
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,020
I can only help the patrons

741
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,650
with loans

742
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,170
to earn a bit for my old age.

743
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:35,380
But I never thought

744
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,730
I'd fall for another man's lies.

745
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,580
He said

746
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,610
he'd bring fresh litchis
back to Chang'an.

747
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,610
Why is my life so miserable?

748
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,330
If someone's dying, it should be me.

749
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,420
What are you whining for?

750
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,540
If you die, what about me?

751
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,580
You men all love lying to me.

752
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,380
Mr. Zheng used to

753
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,330
come to Pingkang Ward

754
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,480
every day for pleasure.

755
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,100
But ever since he vouched for you,

756
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,100
he's vanished without a trace.

757
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,860
If this debt ends up

758
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,500
turning into a dead account,

759
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,060
I'll just lose my business.

760
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,290
But your daughter...

761
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,950
will end up being sold into slavery.

762
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:39,980
Let me tell you,

763
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,920
on the first day of June,

764
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,770
whether I live or die,

765
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,540
I won't owe you a single coin.

766
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,540
But until then,

767
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,300
if you dare
lay a finger on my daughter,

768
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,900
I will fight you to the death...

769
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,730
Stop yelling!

770
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,770
You've already bought the house,

771
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,020
and taken the deed.

772
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,330
I have nothing to hold on to now.

773
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,860
All you can do is trust me.

774
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,460
Protect my daughter,

775
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,020
and I'll keep you alive.

776
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,020
Just trust me.

777
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,290
Listen up.

778
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,900
You should remind her of that.

779
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,230
Alright now.

780
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,350
The Alley Master is watching.

781
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,690
Father.

782
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,650
Don't forget our promise.

783
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,500
When the osmanthus blooms,

784
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:26,940
you must come back.

785
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,250
I won't forget.

786
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,130
Alright then.

787
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,210
I embroidered this.

788
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,420
Father, take it with you.

789
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,940
It's like I'm always by your side.

790
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:44,580
Sure.

791
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,460
I'll make it a quick trip.

792
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,130
Be good, alright?

793
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:54,210
Xiu'er.

794
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:55,650
Come here.

795
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,460
(Osmanthus blooms in August.)

796
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,730
(I thought Noble Consort's)

797
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:17,810
(birthday was in June.)

798
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,730
(Why did you lie to the child)

799
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,830
(and say she won't see you till autumn?)

800
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,133
(This journey could cost my life.)

801
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,060
(I didn't want her hope)

802
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,130
(to die so soon.)

803
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,380
(The osmanthus tree
at my old mansion)

804
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,290
(died years ago.)

805
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,980
The road to Lingnan is rough.

806
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:51,500
Liangyuan,

807
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,100
take care of yourself.

808
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,020
We've been kindred spirits.

809
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,500
Now we part ways.

810
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,860
Who knows

811
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,330
if we'll meet again in this life.

812
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,580
Here.

813
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,500
Once you're out the gate,

814
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,020
don't be taken advantage of on the road.

815
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,540
Family bonds can't be broken.

816
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,460
A man must be ready to die any day.

817
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,290
Riding fast, reins in hand,

818
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,810
a lock of black hair trails behind.

819
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,170
Dashing down from cliffs,

820
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:59,210
I lean forward to seize the banner.

821
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,770
Family bonds can't be broken.

822
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:15,460
A man must be ready to die any day.

823
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,210
If there's no way back,

824
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,100
then charge forward.

825
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,810
Fight with everything we've got!

826
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,700
(Chang'an, Shangzhou)

827
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,170
Even the best horse has dropped dead.

828
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,860
So...

829
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,230
How am I going to do this?

830
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,170
How?

831
00:42:04,644 --> 00:42:09,500
(Yingzhou, Hezhou, Yangtze River)

832
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:25,900
(Ezhou, Jiangzhou, Hongzhou, Qianzhou)

833
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:43,020
(Qinzhou, Chunzou, Gaozhou)

834
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,180
=The Litchi Road=

835

(The 3rd day of February, 13th year
of Tianbao: Dispatch the Litchi Envoy)

836

837
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,460
Ping'an?

838
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,940
I'm Ma Guiyun.

839
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:02,940
Ma who?

840
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:03,940
Who's Ma Guiyun?

841
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:04,540
Me.

842
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:05,650
Aren't you Zheng Ping'an?

843
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,690
Ma Guiyun!

844
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,630
