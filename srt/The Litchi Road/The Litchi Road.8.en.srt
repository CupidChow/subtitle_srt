(Double-layer urn)

3
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,770
Hold it steady.

4
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,560
Make way.

5
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,280
Here's your goods.

6
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,320
Very nice.

7
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,530
Thanks.

8
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,280
Pull.

9
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,690
Stop.

=Episode 8=

11
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,779
We won!

12
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,639
We won!

13
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,489
We won!

14
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,920
Isn't he a general?

15
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,800
A real general!

16
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,600
- Lan.
- Lan.

17
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,049
(Lan)
Chicken Daddy!

18
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,560
Lan!

19
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,019
Why are you so late?

20
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,450
Sorry, sorry.

21
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,809
I just got myself

22
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,339
a Redcrest General.

23
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,579
Take a look.

24
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,600
See if he's up to your standards.

25
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,779
Small head,

26
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,929
strong build,

27
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,040
tight legs, firm grip.

28
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,579
But...

29
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,850
But what?

30
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,859
Look at that bird.

31
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,130
Proud stance,

32
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,899
so full of itself,

33
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,970
but deep down, it's lost.

34
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,360
From what I see,

35
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,489
it was probably raised in the wild.

36
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,169
Learned from nature,

37
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,530
formed naturally.

38
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,160
But now it's new here.

39
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,049
Big change of scene.

40
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,920
And it's confused.

41
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,090
That kind of mindset

42
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,160
shows it's unsettled.

43
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,330
Its fierceness and drive

44
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,770
aren't fully fired up yet.

45
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,240
It needs more time and training.

46
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,929
So,

47
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,330
not fit for the ring today.

48
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,090
What if I insist on letting it fight?

49
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,090
It won't last three rounds.

50
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,689
Alright.

51
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,659
Lan,

52
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,240
great.

53
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,139
Today, I'll open your eyes.

54
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,099
How about it?

55
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,019
My General here

56
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,169
has just eaten and rested.

57
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,480
Ready for battle.

58
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,419
I'll show you

59
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,779
how it wins three rounds in a row.

60
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,859
- Let's go.
- Alright!

61
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,770
Chicken Daddy! Chicken Daddy!
Chicken Daddy!

62
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,290
We've found out.
Li Shande isn't with the Left Chancellor.

63
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,539
Ma Guiyun's pushing for a deal.

64
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,049
A deal? No time.

65
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,809
Inspector He, I brought ink and brush.

66
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,419
Ma, you're here too?

67
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,979
Come play with us.

68
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,480
No, no, no.

69
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,579
We should take care of business first.

70
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,859
We're at the Cockfighting Ring.

71
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,680
Cockfighting is business.

72
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,339
- Isn't it?
- Right.

73
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,729
What are you so anxious about?

74
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,339
It's fine to be late half a day.

75
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,899
No one's rushing us.

76
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,489
Yes, they are. Yes, they are!

77
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,129
The Right Chancellor's right behind me.

78
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,240
I've got to report back.

79
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,169
Forget the Right Chancellor.

80
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,080
Even if the Noble Consort shows up,
she can wait till I'm done betting. Right?

81
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,049
My General's locked and loaded.

82
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,129
No delays allowed.

83
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,410
Right, right.

84
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:37,979
Everyone, listen up!

85
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,680
Which rooster dares to fight?

86
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,369
Bravo! Excellent!

87
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,120
What a fierce battle!

88
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,330
Just like the poem says,

89
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,779
"Red-crested cock is bold in glory.

90
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,219
Twin spurs are sharp like blades.

91
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,659
With burning might it charges

92
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,890
to clash in the Tang's arena.

93
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,929
Its claws reach like jade hooks.

94
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,049
Eyes blazing like fire.

95
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,979
Long tail lifts in gusting wind.

96
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,289
Strong wings stretch wide.

97
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,850
A leap, a strike with its hooked beak.

98
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,729
Strikes like lightning,
then soars again."

99
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,960
Brilliant!

100
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,040
Is there more?

101
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,059
Come on!

102
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,330
Bring it on!

103
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,920
What now?

104
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,520
Inspector He.

105
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,800
Inspector He.

106
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,490
There's no one...

107
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,160
There's no one left to fight.

108
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,680
No one stepped up.

109
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,339
Winning without a fight.

110
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,529
You've won!

111
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,009
That's not a win!

112
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,009
I said it already.

113
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,299
We fight all three rounds.

114
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,609
I'll stay right here

115
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,609
till we finish

116
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,489
all three rounds.

117
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,760
You can count on me.

118
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,489
I'll raise it fifteen guan.

119
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,400
Gou'er, bring the money!

120
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,699
The bet is raised.

121
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,160
Another fifteen guan!

122
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,920
Anyone? I'm adding fifteen more!

123
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,570
I'll go.

124
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,840
- Lan.
- Lan.

125
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,680
Let me borrow your rooster.

126
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,250
Wait a second.

127
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,409
That rooster just fought

128
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,489
and lost.

129
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,129
My Redcrest General

130
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,979
doesn't fight nobodies.

131
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,249
It's an insult to its name.

132
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,249
If a hundred-foot dragon

133
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,080
is deathly sick,

134
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,040
it can be beaten by a tiny fish.

135
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,560
If a strong man

136
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,299
is weak and withered,

137
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,410
he can't even beat a toddler.

138
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,819
A gust without strength

139
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,129
can't lift a feather.

140
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,400
A dull arrow

141
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,840
can't pierce silk.

142
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,130
Your Redcrest is fierce,

143
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,130
but your stubborn pride

144
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,000
will be your downfall.

145
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,040
You're talking nonsense.
I didn't understand a word.

146
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,920
So, are we fighting or not?

147
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,819
Come on.

148
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,009
- Fight!
- Fight!

149
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,699
Fight!

150
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,819
Alright!

151
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,529
Fight! Fight! Fight!

152
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,680
One, two, three!

153
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,550
(Memorial Tablet of Redcrest General)

154
00:10:38,568 --> 00:10:42,318
You died such a tragic death.

155
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,059
General.

156
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,160
Why'd you have to leave us so soon?

157
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,680
General.

158
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,090
My son.

159
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,800
A bird of all five virtues.

160
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,490
Today, my son

161
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,440
fought three rounds in a row

162
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,440
and defeated all with his steel claws

163
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,609
and deadly beaks.

164
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,130
Heaven truly envies talent!

165
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,560
Fate is cruel!

166
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,840
Farewell, brave soul.

167
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,040
My son,

168
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,320
I'll take you into my belly now.

169
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,299
Let it be your resting place.

170
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,440
Oh no!

171
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,200
So sad!

172
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,410
So, so sad!

173
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,979
Oh no!

174
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,920
General.

175
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,370
Bring me some salt.

176
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:55,769
Yes.

177
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,960
Feels like something's still missing.

178
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,370
General!

179
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,490
Oh no!

180
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,800
So sad!

181
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,770
So, so sad! Oh no!

182
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,219
Alright, alright, enough.

183
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,800
Rest in peace, General!

184
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,579
Do you still want the fish tally?

185
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,610
I've been fooling around with you
all morning.

186
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,179
Why the rush?

187
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,770
We're not done yet.

188
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,320
Hey, Chief Scribe Zhao.

189
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,099
Go, go, get the paper and brush.

190
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,279
Grind the ink.

191
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,550
(Inspector's Office)

192
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,130
Inspector He.

193
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,129
Chief Scribe Zhao.

194
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,370
What wording did I use last time?

195
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,640
Recite it for me.

196
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,970
I'm going to test you.

197
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,010
Test me?

198
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,800
Recite it.

199
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,760
Alright.

200
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,040
"A fine bird picks the right tree
to perch on.

201
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:21,890
A worthy minister picks the right lord
to serve.

202
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,859
If one meets a good master

203
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,320
but lets the chance slip by,

204
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,889
he's no real man.

205
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,339
- Actually,
- Youguang...

206
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,680
that could've been said much simpler.

207
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,490
Ma Guiyun.

208
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,560
Why are you in such a hurry today?

209
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,090
I...

210
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,200
I'm anxious to get home.

211
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,770
I wish to set out early.

212
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,410
This one's not good.

213
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,330
Do another one.

214
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,800
Zhao.

215
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,440
Recite it again.

216
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,130
Slower this time.

217
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,250
Alright.

218
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,610
"A"

219
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,920
"Bird."

220
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,530
How do you write "bird"?

221
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,650
"Chooses."

222
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,009
"Chooses."

223
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,889
Chooses.

224
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,200
Chooses.

225
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,210
Chooses.

226
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,130
"To."

227
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,890
"To."

228
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,920
"A thousand miles."

229
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,840
"Away."

230
00:15:20,768 --> 00:15:22,040
"He."

231
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,680
"You."

232
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,570
"Guang."

233
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,800
"Respectfully."

234
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,370
"Bows."

235
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,920
"Humbly."

236
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,219
That's enough.

237
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,490
That's good enough.

238
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,939
My handwriting

239
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,290
has improved.

240
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,000
Very elegant.

241
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,059
Here, here, here.

242
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,330
Elegant.

243
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,610
I'm exhausted.

244
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,730
Alright.

245
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,520
Inspector He.

246
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,010
Guiyun.

247
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,210
Come.

248
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,299
Reporting.

249
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,489
Reporting.

250
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,650
Reporting!

251
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,769
- Reporting.
- Report what?

252
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:52,979
Can't you see I'm busy?

253
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,250
Inspector He.

254
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,609
You rushed here in such a hurry.

255
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,250
Is something urgent?

256
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,770
However urgent it is,

257
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,680
it's not more important than our deal.

258
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,409
Then I'll just let that envoy
from the Right Chancellor

259
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,680
wait.

260
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,840
The Right Chancellor's envoy?

261
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,170
The Right Chancellor sent an envoy?

262
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,730
You didn't know?

263
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,080
He never mentioned it.

264
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,730
Might be a fake then.

265
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,640
Sugar is sweet.

266
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,930
Salt is salty.

267
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,120
Pop it in your mouth and taste it.

268
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,930
You'll know right away.

269
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,169
Whether it's real or fake,

270
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,609
bring him up here. I want a look.

271
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,080
Inspector He, that's unwise.

272
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,240
Inspector He.

273
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,600
Under the Right Chancellor,

274
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,010
there are many capable men.

275
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,019
Each has a role to play.

276
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,970
If he's really from the Chancellor,

277
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,689
then I ought to avoid suspicion too.

278
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,259
Why not finish our business first?

279
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,209
What do you say?

280
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,299
Inspector He.

281
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,299
That envoy outside won't wait much longer.

282
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,040
Let him wait.

283
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,370
Inspector He.

284
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,800
Even among colleagues,

285
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,290
there's competition.

286
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,690
I was about to complete a mission.

287
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,080
He came and snatched half the credit.

288
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,250
That's really not ideal.

289
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,259
I totally get it.

290
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,739
It's like meat already in your mouth,

291
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,600
yet someone else takes half of it.

292
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,040
It's painful.

293
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,560
But what's that got to do with me?

294
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,499
Let's go see.

295
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,770
Yes, sir.

296
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,610
Guiyun.

297
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,720
Come on, let's go take a look together.

298
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,010
Let's go. Take a look.

299
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,530
See if it's real or not.

300
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,970
If it's real, you'll know.

301
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,130
Where is he?

302
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,570
He's almost here.

303
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,010
Just about to arrive.

304
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,339
He's here.

305
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,299
Quick.

306
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,570
Quick.

307
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:02,960
Malaria?

308
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,680
Let me see.

309
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,040
What is malaria?

310
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,320
Let me tell you, Guiyun.

311
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,210
Lingnan's climate is humid and hot.
There are mosquitoes year-round.

312
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,579
This envoy was likely bitten by them

313
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,930
and caught malaria.

314
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,889
And since he was rushing on the road,

315
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,360
he didn't get treatment in time.

316
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,720
What happens then?

317
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,690
Enough nonsense.

318
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,129
Come and see.

319
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,800
Is he your colleague?

320
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,680
Gui...

321
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,800
Guiyun.

322
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,050
I'm Guiyun.

323
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,970
It's me, Guiyun.

324
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,539
You're not...

325
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,840
It's not that I won't go back.

326
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,930
I really can't go back.

327
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:32,770
He's dead.

328
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,200
He's dead?

329
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,840
How could he die?

330
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,600
Did the Right Chancellor
leave any message?

331
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,739
Liang!

332
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,010
Liang!

333
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,129
Liang!

334
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:52,969
Answer me.

335
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,240
- Say something!
- Sir.

336
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,690
The Right Chancellor sent me
this secret missive.

337
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,730
You can't read it.

338
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,530
Do you still want

339
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,360
the fish tally?

340
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,099
- Yes.
- Of course we want it.

341
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,370
Absolutely.

342
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,680
Zhao.

343
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,240
Guiyun.

344
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,240
Guiyun.

345
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,400
In that case,

346
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,840
I'll take my leave.

347
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,290
Once we're in Chang'an,

348
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,099
the three of us

349
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,449
will drink and talk freely.

350
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,770
Drink and talk freely.

351
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,880
Give my colleague

352
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,240
a proper burial.

353
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,480
Qilang.

354
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,929
(Siling Apothecary)

355
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,200
Mister.

356
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,160
Mister.

357
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,480
I came to pick up the medicine.

358
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,259
Sir,

359
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,530
you're finally here.

360
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,409
Yesterday, no matter how I called you,

361
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,210
you just kept walking.

362
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,339
Mister,

363
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,299
that old lady weaving baskets by the door,

364
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,690
why isn't she here today?

365
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:23,010
Oh, she'll be here soon.

366
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,649
She weaves those baskets

367
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,010
to earn money for her son's medicine.

368
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,649
Ma'am.

369
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:35,929
Oh, it's you, fellow townsman.

370
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,649
I thought you weren't coming out today.

371
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,930
How could I not?

372
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,690
Are you here to learn basket weaving?

373
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,080
I'm here to buy some baskets.

374
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,920
Alright.

375
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,400
I'll take this one.

376
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,040
That boat, and that small one.
I'll take them all.

377
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,640
You're a grown man,

378
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,840
what do you need so many baskets for?

379
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,880
I heard what the store owner said.

380
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,280
We're from the same place, after all.

381
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,010
I know you're all good people.

382
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,770
You pity an old woman like me.

383
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,689
But my son is still alive.

384
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,530
So you see, in this world,

385
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,120
nothing is absolute.

386
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,360
As long as I've still got breath in me,

387
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,450
I'll fight for a sliver of hope

388
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,930
for my son.

389
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,840
From Lantian,
we enter the Shangzhou Circuit.

390
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,019
(Shangzhou, Xiangzhou, Ezhou)

391
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,859
(Jiangzhou, Hongzhou, Jizhou)
Shangzhou Circuit.

392
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,080
We pass Xiangzhou
and cross the Han River.

393
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,339
(Chang'an)

394
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,450
Then, through Ezhou,

395
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,970
we cross the river
and follow the current

396
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,770
to Hongzhou, Jizhou, and Qianzhou.

397
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,010
We cross the Five Ridges,

398
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,730
through Mei Pass, and reach Shaozhou.

399
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,970
Shaozhou.

400
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,739
To Shaozhou.

401
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,520
(Litchi Route)
And from there, we follow...

402
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:11,690
I wonder if Xiu'er is eating well.

403
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,889
These days,

404
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:17,400
I've become much rounder.

405
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:23,010
This morning, I had a bowl of
millet and pork congee

406
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:27,800
topped with crushed almonds
and fine cane sugar.

407
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:33,080
There were also three plates of vegetables
drizzled with duck oil,

408
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:36,450
a ginkgo-steamed egg,

409
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,970
and a cup of seaweed wine.

410
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,969
A servant from the inn brought the food

411
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,530
and asked me,

412
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:49,859
"Down in Lingnan,
you've got fruits all year round

413
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,400
and flowers blooming without end.

414
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,449
So, which is better,

415
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,120
Chang'an or Lingnan?"

416
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,080
I told him,

417
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,970
"If you see green all year,
you'll grow tired of it.

418
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,170
You need the bleakness of autumn,

419
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,530
the harshness of winter,

420
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,640
so that when the green
of spring returns,

421
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,450
it becomes the most beautiful sight
in the world.

422
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,169
No matter how harsh the winter is,

423
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:24,040
how the cold freezes over Chang'an,

424
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:28,250
spring lush always comes back on time."

425
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,530
That's what's so good about Chang'an."

426
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:37,490
The servant thought it made sense

427
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,690
and praised me as a great man of letters
from Chang'an.

428
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,930
I laughed aloud.

429
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,560
He had no idea those words

430
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,080
came from our Xiu'er
during a spring outing.

431
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,880
I kept it close to my heart.

432
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,920
Xiu'er,

433
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:01,320
I missed out on spring with you
this time.

434
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,730
But when the osmanthus blooms,

435
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:08,120
I'll make sure not to miss it again.

436
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,730
Only this osmanthus tree

437
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,490
has yet to sprout.

438
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,680
Xiu'er,

439
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,570
the rain's getting heavier.

440
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,170
Let's go home.

441
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,770
We'll come back another day.

442
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,690
Father once said

443
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,040
every tree has its own time to bloom.

444
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,369
He must be

445
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:48,169
tied up

446
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,640
by his duties in Lingnan.

447
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,730
This osmanthus tree

448
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,250
is waiting for him.

449
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,910
(Wenzheng Study)

450
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,209
Sir,

451
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,480
Mr. Zheng is here.

452
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,560
Looks like your matter is settled.

453
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,200
Yes.

454
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,640
Guess what?

455
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,539
That top assassin from Chang'an,

456
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:26,170
that cold-blooded and ruthless killer
working for the Right Chancellor

457
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,290
actually came down with malaria.

458
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,770
He died before he could leave a word.

459
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,649
Well, in any case,

460
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,689
congrats to you.

461
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,170
You got what you wanted.

462
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,770
Likewise, likewise,

463
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,130
Master.

464
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:43,050
Who would've thought that a month ago,

465
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,210
I was still a wine steward in Chang'an.

466
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,609
And in just one month,

467
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,600
I've faced life and death.

468
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,930
As they say, fortune favors the bold.

469
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,880
Tomorrow, I can leave for Chang'an.

470
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:57,889
Master,

471
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:00,600
this is the letter of loyalty.

472
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,689
And this here,

473
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,019
from that short-lived envoy

474
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,320
of the Right Chancellor.

475
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:08,010
A secret missive.

476
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,520
(Qijing Pavilion)

477
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:23,689
You've read it?

478
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,960
No.

479
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,259
No, Master.

480
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,059
I know the rules.

481
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,969
I'd never peek at what I shouldn't.

482
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,259
Never ask what I shouldn't.

483
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,010
Including this whole Lingnan trip,

484
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,930
I'll forget it completely.

485
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,449
Your help to me,

486
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,840
I'll never forget it
for the rest of my life.

487
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,930
If you ever come to Chang'an one day,

488
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,169
I promise I'll

489
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,499
take you to the best restaurant

490
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,970
and treat you to a proper feast.

491
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,819
Once you're back in Chang'an,

492
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,730
you'll be one of the Zheng family.

493
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,960
I

494
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,339
don't want to have anything

495
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,690
to do with the Zheng family.

496
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,170
The Zheng family

497
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,320
is one of the Five Great Clans.

498
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,690
We're of noble status.

499
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,840
You are refined.

500
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,120
I suppose you don't want to
rely on the powerful.

501
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,800
Please don't take offense.

502
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,970
I was merely speaking objectively.

503
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,969
The Zhengs in Chang'an today

504
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,689
may still be a prestigious clan,

505
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,360
but they no longer have any backbone.

506
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,490
They're just a bunch of cowards
who fear death.

507
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,690
They no longer deserve the reputation.

508
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,019
But whether you return to the Zheng family
is your choice.

509
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,129
I'm an outsider.

510
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,530
I'll say no more.

511
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:46,530
May I ask why
you hold such a strong bias

512
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,400
against the Zheng family?

513
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,450
If one speaks of people or events based
on incomplete understanding, that's bias.

514
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,409
But my view of the Zhengs

515
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,099
comes from knowing full well

516
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,730
how your father met his wrongful end.

517
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,169
The one blinded by their gilded name

518
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,490
is likely you.

519
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:06,930
You've helped me for days,
Master Konglang.

520
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,560
I'm truly grateful.

521
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,290
But even if

522
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,210
you have eyes across the realm,

523
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,010
when it comes to the Zheng family,

524
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,250
no one knows better than I do.

525
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,880
Back then, my father

526
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,490
committed shameful acts.

527
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,800
When the authorities came after him,

528
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:30,170
he couldn't take the pressure
and killed himself in guilt.

529
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,290
He abandoned my sister and me.

530
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,579
We were left

531
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,010
to fend for ourselves.

532
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,770
All while carrying his disgrace.

533
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,400
If not for him,

534
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,169
as a son of a noble family,

535
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,499
how would I have ended up

536
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,250
serving wine in Chang'an?

537
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,969
My sister wouldn't have died

538
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,290
without even a single dose of medicine.

539
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,290
I didn't expect that.

540
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,199
To think even you

541
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,120
doubt your own father.

542
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,640
Do you really believe

543
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,490
your father was at fault?

544
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,090
Was he not?

545
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,649
Back then,

546
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,450
your father was honest and upright.

547
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,209
The Right Chancellor tried
to win him over.

548
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,209
But he flatly refused.

549
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,800
He refused to be corrupted.

550
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,019
The Right Chancellor was enraged

551
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,539
and had him murdered.

552
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,840
He framed him with charges
to ruin his name,

553
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,600
claiming he killed himself out of guilt.

554
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,080
If that were true,

555
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,880
then why did the elders of the family
expel my sister and me?

556
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,579
Because the Zheng family dared not
offend the Right Chancellor.

557
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,930
To protect themselves,

558
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,409
they gave away

559
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,209
the shop your father fought to protect

560
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,970
and handed it to the Right Chancellor.

561
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,499
They didn't even care

562
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,449
that you two were still children.

563
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,450
They cast you out of the family

564
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,499
to show complete severance
from your father's line

565
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,600
to assure it would never be
brought up again.

566
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,369
They're the mighty Zhengs of Xingyang,
yet none of them

567
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:06,819
stepped up to uncover the truth
or clear his name. How pitiful.

568
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,889
Why should I believe you?

569
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,969
I know this because the Left Chancellor
wanted to save your father.

570
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:12,650
He sent someone to find him.

571
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,299
As far as I'm concerned,

572
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,779
he died near a fruit stall

573
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,570
in Pingkang Ward.

574
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,890
Enough!

575
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,200
That's enough.

576
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,739
Your father gave his life

577
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,049
to protect you.

578
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,730
And this is how you see him?

579
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,250
You turn a blind eye to the evidence.

580
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,480
You are unworthy of being his son.

581
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,530
You should go.

582
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:47,009
I hope you achieve success and fame

583
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,650
and rise to wealth and honor.

584
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,410
Qilang.

585
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,489
Master Konglang

586
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,400
might have just heard it from others.

587
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,369
Maybe

588
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,779
Deputy Director Lu can't keep

589
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,000
his promise to you.

590
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,090
You don't have to believe
everything she says.

591
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,280
No.

592
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,730
Everything she said is true.

593
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:43,969
That day, I made a fuss because
I wanted to eat Yulu dumplings

594
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,240
from Pingkang Ward.

595
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,360
My sister saw me making a scene

596
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,730
and slapped me.

597
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,409
Father didn't say a word.

598
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,680
He just walked out.

599
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,299
He died on the way

600
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,969
to buy me those dumplings.

Drink less.

613
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,650
I brought your medicine.

614
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,890
Rest up early.

615
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:11,720
Shande.

616
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,630
Have a drink with me.

617
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,610
Can you?

618
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,730
All these years in Chang'an,

619
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,010
I've drunk so much.

620
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,520
I've been walking on eggshells.

621
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,920
I clung to the powerful
and played both sides.

622
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,570
I danced to entertain people.

623
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,520
I got them drunk and cheerful,

624
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,800
but I ended up throwing up myself.

625
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:14,000
I've been pushing myself so hard

626
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,610
just to return to the Zheng family.

627
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,440
But look at me now.

628
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,130
All those drinks were for nothing.

629
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,800
I want to get drunk.

630
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,050
Shande.

631
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,730
Do you know what kind of life
I had as a child?

632
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,320
Fine clothes and good food.

633
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,290
I had no idea what hardship meant.

634
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,320
When I was six or seven,

635
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,130
I was a chubby boy.

636
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,339
I insisted my father carry me

637
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,920
around the courtyard.

638
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,889
He went in circles again and again,

639
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,770
round and round.

640
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,240
In the end,

641
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,610
he was bedridden for half a month.

642
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,840
When I got older,

643
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,290
I was naughty.

644
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:21,320
I set our house on fire.

645
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,320
Only then did I learn

646
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,960
it was everything my father owned.

647
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,570
He still never blamed me.

648
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,920
I loved the Yulu dumplings
from Pingkang Ward.

649
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:42,290
Crispy and delicate,

650
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,920
white as jade.

651
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,720
They had to be folded three times
just to layer the dough.

652
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,840
The crust

653
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,210
ended up with 36 layers.

654
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,570
He must have gone out that day
so I wouldn't be disappointed.

655
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:04,610
That's why he went to buy them.

656
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,240
Ping'an.

657
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,170
Why are you suddenly saying all this?

658
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,400
I never let anyone mention it.

659
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,930
I hated him.

660
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,570
I hated my father

661
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,610
for getting us expelled
from the Zheng family.

662
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,210
I hated him

663
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,920
for abandoning us.

664
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,610
But today,

665
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,890
I realized

666
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,400
he didn't want to drag us down.

667
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:44,130
He was trying to protect my sister and me.

668
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,050
If this grudge isn't avenged,

669
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:56,699
I, Zheng Ping'an,

670
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,210
am no son at all.

671
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,840
Ping'an.

672
00:41:05,418 --> 00:41:07,878
All fathers in the world

673
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:09,819
would give up their lives

674
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,840
for their children.

675
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,410
Today,

676
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,650
I had planned to tell you

677
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,090
my decision.

678
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,570
But I was afraid you'd ask me

679
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,770
why I stayed.

680
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:29,859
But now I believe

681
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,400
you'll understand.

682
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:35,250
I was afraid that if I left,

683
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,730
Xiu'er would be devastated.

684
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,970
Shande.

685
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,240
I've decided.

686
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,210
Starting today,

687
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,130
I won't chase you away.

688
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,050
And I won't leave either.

689
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,360
I'll stay in Lingnan.

690
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,290
I'll avenge my father.

691
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:05,449
Life blossoms

692
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,659
through every second.

693
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,770
There are no shortcuts, only action.

694
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,560
Only with both strength and grace
can a dance have endless forms.

695
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,720
The heart follows the strings,
the hands follow the drum.

696
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,619
Now is the moment you spin the fastest.

697
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,440
You must keep thinking ahead.

698
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,440
How do you keep it going?

699
00:42:29,598 --> 00:42:32,868
=The Litchi Road=

700
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,400
Qijing Pavilion?

701
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,570
I want to gather more evidence.

702
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:39,880
I'll take down the Right Chancellor.

703
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:47,049
You want to take down the Right Chancellor?

704
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,770
You can't even deliver litchis.

705
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,280
Did I laugh?

706
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,000
Go get some horses.

707
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:56,449
Let's try one trip.

708
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:57,720
See how it goes.
