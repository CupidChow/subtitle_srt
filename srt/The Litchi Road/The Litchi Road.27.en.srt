00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,999
=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,980
(To Free Oneself: One)
(Ding Tong'er)

3
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,540
Move it!

4
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,580
(Nine Years Ago)

5
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,420
Hurry up!

6
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,180
She is plain-looking.

7
00:01:51,222 --> 00:01:53,022
Send her to the kitchen.

8
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,020
Yes.

9
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,400
Come on.

10
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,060
If Qiao had not alerted us in time,

11
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:02,800
you really would have gotten away.

12
00:02:04,911 --> 00:02:06,050
Admit your fault.

13
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,580
Admit you were wrong,
and the past will be forgiven.

14
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,580
Stop!

15
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,740
Stop! Please!

16
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,420
Stop! Stop...

17
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,420
Stop!

18
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,420
Please stop!

19
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,311
I am grateful for the kindness

20
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,580
you have shown me.

21
00:02:58,088 --> 00:02:59,540
You are in your prime,

22
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,180
sure to marry

23
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,177
a woman from a noble family.

24
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,660
Even if I am crushed to pieces,

25
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,860
I will never abandon you, Shiqi.

26
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,733
Then I shall grant your wish.

27
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:19,200
Beat him within an inch of his life.

28
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,620
Please stop.

29
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,260
Stop!

30
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,820
Please stop hitting him!

31
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,540
I will forget him.

32
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,420
You better mean it.

33
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,010
Let him go.

34
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,500
Please let him go...

35
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,620
Stop.

36
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,910
At ease.

37
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,150
Give him the hairpin

38
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,466
from my hair.

39
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,080
Release him.

40
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,700
After today,

41
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,577
we may never meet again.

42
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,740
This hairpin is for you.

43
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,840
Use it

44
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,022
to pay your way back home.

45
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,860
Shiqi...

46
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,220
I swear.

47
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,500
Give me two months,

48
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:07,577
and I will gather enough money

49
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,140
to repay the down payment

50
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:12,266
and return to buy back your freedom.

51
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,400
In the third year of Tianbao,

52
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,510
someone said the same thing

53
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,380
to me.

54
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,580
But he never came back.

55
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,420
Over the years,

56
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,740
I have heard the same empty promise
in Pingkang Ward

57
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,740
time and time again.

58
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,860
Never once has it changed.

59
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,730
Leave!

60
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,100
Mr. Xue...

61
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,610
Mr. Xue.

62
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:20,800
Madam Shiqi,
you've had too much to drink again.

63
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,888
I am Qin.

64
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,740
Indeed.

65
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:44,355
It has already been over a month.

66
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,460
Do you hear the cicadas?

67
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,180
Lying here listening

68
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,000
to the cicadas,

69
00:07:09,755 --> 00:07:11,460
I am reminded of my childhood days.

70
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,860
Sitting on my father's boat

71
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,533
as he gathered water chestnuts,

72
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,100
we floated between lotus ponds.

73
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:24,780
Lotus leaves stretched like clouds,

74
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,540
and fish would leap from the water.

75
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:36,244
The only thing Chang'an and my hometown

76
00:07:36,244 --> 00:07:37,320
have in common

77
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,860
is the sound of the cicadas.

78
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,300
But cicadas are just cicadas.

79
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,900
The Madam Shiqi who listened

80
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,940
to them that summer night,

81
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,190
died the day she was sold

82
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,600
into Zuihong Pavilion.

83
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,500
=Episode 27=

84
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Mr. Li.

85
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,580
I cannot grant you this favor.

86
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,020
Then, in that case,

87
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,740
I will take my leave.

88
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,640
Wait.

89
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,560
You have revealed

90
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,940
all your intentions...

91
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:24,711
Do you think
I'd let you walk away with the deed?

92
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,180
Don't you dare!

93
00:09:26,377 --> 00:09:28,140
You dare lay hands on an imperial envoy?

94
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,200
Are you looking to die?

95
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,088
Step aside!

96
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,070
Stay away!

97
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,860
Do you have a death wish?

98
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,910
I am the court-appointed Litchi Envoy!

99
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:42,622
Are you all out of your minds?

100
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,780
Get up!

101
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:05,260

Yes.

117
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:55,020
Be sure to serve General Gao
with utmost care.

118
00:11:57,044 --> 00:11:58,690
Listen carefully to everything said

119
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,380
during the banquet,

120
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:02,711
then come back and report it to me.

121
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,580
Let us raise our cups in celebration

122
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,780
to Wu,

123
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,180
for coming out on top.

124
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,340
I am curious.

125
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,560
(Why do you not,)

126
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,270
(like others,)

127
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,900
(go to great lengths
to curry favor with guests?)

128
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,820
(How is it you can gather)

129
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,260
(all these nobles)

130
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,460
(and elites so quickly,)

131
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,888
(just by collecting secrets?)

132
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,400
This residence

133
00:12:43,488 --> 00:12:45,540
once belonged to Li Xiangxiang,

134
00:12:45,688 --> 00:12:47,577
a famous courtesan of Pingkang Ward.

135
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,180
Legend has it

136
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,300
she often stood right here,

137
00:12:59,844 --> 00:13:01,888
staring blankly at that other residence.

138
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:08,000
That is the Right Chancellor's mansion.

139
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,690
Do you know
why the Right Chancellor chose

140
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,333
to build his mansion in Pingkang Ward?

141
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,940
No.

142
00:13:19,244 --> 00:13:20,977
Because buried beneath Pingkang Ward

143
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,570
is the most valuable thing of all.

144
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,530
What is it?

145
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:36,420
Secrets.

146
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,711
Poor Li Xiangxiang spent her whole life

147
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,610
trying to climb her way

148
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,410
to the Right Chancellor,

149
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,790
but she never understood

150
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,777
the truth was
right in front of her all along.

151
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,380
(Attendant Yu.)

152
00:13:59,466 --> 00:14:01,259
I've visited every relevant office
by Chen hour

153
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,660
and gotten the approvals processed.

154
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,500
Last night's heavy rain

155
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,500
washed everything clean.

156
00:14:07,644 --> 00:14:09,400
A true cleansing, a fresh rebirth.

157
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,780
It is quite refreshing.

158
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,700
That downpour

159
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,860
not only cleansed the filth,

160
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,460
but also dampened

161
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,955
the arrogance of that Litchi Envoy.

162
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,740
He never imagined

163
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,540
that behind Madam Shiqi stood

164
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,639
the Right Chancellor himself.

165
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,240
It was the Baiwang people
who were helping

166
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,444
Right Chancellor
manage the money-lending business.

167
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,620
All of Li Shande's efforts
were for nothing.

168
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,730
In the end, he still fell into the trap

169
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,640
you laid in Chang'an.

170
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,980
He has lost the property deed.

171
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,340
No doubt

172
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,820
he was in utter despair last night.

173
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,420
One must endure the agony of nirvana

174
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,050
to be reborn beautifully.

175
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,620
Come.

176
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,580
It is time for us

177
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,820
to feed the fish.

178
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,460
Otherwise,

179
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,540
they may starve

180
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:00,570
in our own pond.

181
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,240
The years passed so swiftly.

182
00:15:11,288 --> 00:15:13,140
When I first arrived
at the Shanglin Office,

183
00:15:14,844 --> 00:15:16,980
a batch of new peonies was brought
to Leyou Garden.

184
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,820
Chief Liu

185
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,980
had me move you all

186
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,580
to a quiet corner of the garden.

187
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,020
Though no one came to admire you,

188
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,780
each year,

189
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,955
you still tried your best to bloom.

190
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,420
That year, there was a late cold snap.

191
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,300
All the flowers were slow to blossom,

192
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:39,155
but you were the first one to bloom.

193
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,500
It moved His Majesty so deeply,
and he wrote a poem in your honor.

194
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,980
From then on,

195
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,666
you became the treasure of Leyou Garden.

196
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,220
But let's be honest.

197
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,460
The moment you gained favor

198
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,220
was also the start of your downfall.

199
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,460
You think

200
00:15:58,866 --> 00:16:00,220
you can just bloom and wither

201
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,180
as you please now?

202
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,100
The others who came with you

203
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,700
withered away.

204
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:12,860
But you?

205
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,820
You are still holding on.

206
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,140
Branches were broken,
and pests were inside.

207
00:16:19,622 --> 00:16:21,488
When life and death are on the line,

208
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,460
everyone avoids you

209
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,300
like the plague,

210
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,780
afraid of being infected.

211
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,270
This time,

212
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,220
I got rid of the pests for you.

213
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,100
You must hang on.

214
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,860
You must live.

215
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,060
Drive your roots deeper.

216
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,580
Bloom with all your might.

217
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,740
Mr. Li.

218
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,800
There you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

219
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,022
You were here all along.

220
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,060
Attendant Yu.

221
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,780
You're here.

222
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,300
Why did you take so long?

223
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,770
Where's my petition?

224
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,380
Patience.

225
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,820
(Lingnan Litchi Transport Memorial)

226
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,740
(Litchi Envoy Li Shande, Imperial Edict)

227
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,300
(Special decree mandating full cooperation)

228
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,300
(from all courier stations
in the transport process.)

229
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,500
(Supervisor of the Left Storage Office
of the Imperial Household Department)

230
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,740
It's been approved!

231
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,380
I found your method

232
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,630
of transport feasible,

233
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,460
so I rushed

234
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:38,740
to help you get this done.

235
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,460
I'm terribly sorry

236
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,920
I missed our meeting.

237
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,333
What are you apologizing for?

238
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,100
This helped me tremendously.

239
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:48,930
How did

240
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,260
the approval get processed

241
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,100
so quickly?

242
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,580
Mr. Li.

243
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:54,488
When it comes to calculations,

244
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:55,920
I am not as precise as you.

245
00:17:56,022 --> 00:17:57,377
When it comes to execution,

246
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,700
I do not have your experience.

247
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:01,777
But I have been in the palace
for many years,

248
00:18:01,888 --> 00:18:03,800
dealing with the offices
and departments.

249
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,120
I do have my way

250
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,980
of getting things done.

251
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:08,970
Yes.

252
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,660
I am unskilled
in these "ways" you speak of.

253
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,580
If you had come with me to Lingnan,

254
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,711
none of this trouble would've happened.

255
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,360
Well...

256
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,100
Now that I have the approval,

257
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:21,822
I can start the transport, right?

258
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,740
Mr. Li.

259
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,300
Do not be hasty.

260
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:27,333
If you want to transport the litchis,

261
00:18:27,555 --> 00:18:29,260
there is one more person you must meet.

262
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,100
This person may not be listed
in the official documents,

263
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,133
but he is above all procedures.

264
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,080
Her Highness?

265
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,520
The Right Chancellor.

266
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,380
Right. The Right Chancellor.

267
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,555
If you want this operation

268
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,700
to proceed smoothly
and without obstruction,

269
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,580
without his nod of approval,

270
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:49,800
even the most complete documentation

271
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,170
is just a pile of worthless paper.

272
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,270
Now that you have the approval,

273
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,980
and the Right Chancellor sees

274
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,260
that you can navigate
the bureaucracy skillfully,

275
00:18:59,111 --> 00:19:00,866
he is more likely to believe

276
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,020
you are capable of carrying this out.

277
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,850
If he agrees to delegate power to you,

278
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,900
no one will dare delay or slack off.

279
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,530
You have thought of everything.

280
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,370
But...

281
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,700
Someone like me

282
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,940
can hardly ever see him.

283
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,350
Could...

284
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,688
Could you help me?

285
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,920
Mr. Li.

286
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,720
Do you know

287
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,488
what people say about me behind my back?

288
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,420
Who... Who would dare?

289
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,900
They say

290
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,155
I never let go
once I bite down on something.

291
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,300
I am merely
sharing His Majesty's burdens

292
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,511
while helping a few along the way.

293
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,130
But when the task is done,

294
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,180
they fear I will steal the credit,

295
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,740
so they twist the story

296
00:20:05,777 --> 00:20:07,044
and slander me.

297
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,380
Mr. Li.

298
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,940
I am sorry,

299
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:22,190
but I cannot speak up for you again
on this matter.

300
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,380
However, I do have a suggestion.

301
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:46,010
The Right Chancellor comes
to the palace several times a month

302
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,720
to play chess with His Majesty.

303
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,700
Tomorrow at midday,

304
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,980
he will pass through
the palace corridor.

305
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,410
Whether he stops

306
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,220
for you then depends

307
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,740
on your own luck, Mr. Li.

308
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,220
You saved my life.

309
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,533
I will never forget your help.

310
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,740
I can finally keep going.

311
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,700
I got the approval.

312
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,260
You got...

313
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,860
How did you manage that?

314
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,620
Attendant Yu

315
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,100
helped me.

316
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,240
The same man

317
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,733
who stole your petition that day?

318
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,140
Seems like we misunderstood him.

319
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,980
That makes him

320
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,780
my benefactor.

321
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,500
I have come across

322
00:21:53,444 --> 00:21:55,600
so many rotten characters
along this journey.

323
00:21:55,755 --> 00:21:57,911
Finally,
I met someone with a conscience.

324
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,010
You have the approval now.

325
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,340
Why do you still look so troubled?

326
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,200
Tomorrow,

327
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,155
I must meet the Right Chancellor.

328
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,020
Only with his support

329
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,860
can I work smoothly

330
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,540
and securely in Lingnan.

331
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,700
But the Right Chancellor

332
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,740
is a lofty figure.

333
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,860
I'm not one

334
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,290
for political doublespeak.

335
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,140
I am working on what to say.

336
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,133
He Youguang mentioned
that Right Chancellor

337
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,439
started out by managing land reclamation

338
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,350
in Western Shu, then later
served as Vice Director

339
00:22:39,355 --> 00:22:42,355
of the Ministry of Revenue and Minister
of the Imperial Household Department.

340
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,400
He has always dealt
with money and goods.

341
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,010
He can tell in an instant what is real

342
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:47,910
and what is false.

343
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,960
You are good with numbers,

344
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,220
so talk to him in numbers.

345
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,444
The more detailed, the better.

346
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,120
Talk numbers?

347
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,200
Just like bags of grain.

348
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,380
If there is even a slight misreport,

349
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,955
the pieces will not fit together.

350
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:09,090
You'll win his favor if you do this.

351
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,460
I can talk numbers.

352
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,955
Then I will talk numbers.

353
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,390
And if he asks why you
still came to see him

354
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,244
even though
you already have the approval?

355
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,380
Then I will tell the truth.

356
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,180
I will say with his support,

357
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,720
I can proceed more securely.

358
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,800
No one will dare obstruct me.

359
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Right Chancellor's connection
to Noble Consort tightly

360
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,488
links him to His Majesty's favor.
That is his greatest interest.

361
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:30,460
If the fresh litchis can bring

362
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,820
a smile to Her Highness,

363
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,990
they must be delivered
through Right Chancellor's hands.

364
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,420
Just say that.

365
00:23:35,955 --> 00:23:37,355
That is what will please him.

366
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,022
Is that not a little too fawning?

367
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,260
If you want his support,

368
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,866
you must appeal to his interests.

369
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,700
Appeal to his interests...

370
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,060
You've been helping me
and worrying about me

371
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,740
all this time,

372
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,580
yet I haven't properly thanked you.

373
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,890
I have my own motives.

374
00:24:12,977 --> 00:24:14,377
A day without avenging my hatred

375
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:17,111
leaves me no peace even
for a moment in Chang'an.

376
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,180
I want to use your influence
to return to Lingnan

377
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,600
and have He Youguang pay
for what he did to my father.

378
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,200
How...

379
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,580
How can I help you?

380
00:24:28,955 --> 00:24:31,088
I want you to help me
request a new identity

381
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:32,333
from the Right Chancellor.

382
00:24:32,488 --> 00:24:33,790
With his backing,

383
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,444
He Youguang won't dare to touch me.

384
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,980
Make way!

385
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:33,555
Who dares block
the Right Chancellor's path?

386
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,044
I am the Supervisor
of the Shanglin Office,

387
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,580
assigned Litchi Envoy, Li Shande.

388
00:25:38,622 --> 00:25:40,444
My respects to the Right Chancellor.

389
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,088
I have just returned from Lingnan.

390
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,220
I have devised a method

391
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,300
to keep litchis from spoiling

392
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,422
during transport to Chang'an,

393
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,780
to add splendor
to Noble Consort's birthday.

394
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:02,540
Go get it.

395
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,780
Yes, Sir.

396
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,020
Anyone who dares obstruct

397
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,810
the Right Chancellor is courting death.

398
00:26:11,911 --> 00:26:13,580
He ended up
with such a deadly assignment.

399
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,980
He is risking his life.
He is at his wit's end.

400
00:26:16,622 --> 00:26:17,870
I think he's lost his mind.

401
00:26:19,755 --> 00:26:21,790
The Right Chancellor
already accepted your petition.

402
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,300
That is a blessing beyond measure.

403
00:26:23,488 --> 00:26:24,644
And yet, you're still here.

404
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,288
- Get lost.
- Good grief.

405
00:26:26,288 --> 00:26:27,280
He still lingers...

406
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,560
- He is overstepping his bounds.
- The litchi transport method

407
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,000
can go wildly wrong
even with the slightest miscalculation.

408
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,377
Right Chancellor,
please give me a moment.

409
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,980
Allow me to explain it in full detail.

410
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,488
Insolent! Right Chancellor handles
countless affairs each day.

411
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,444
How could he have time
to idle here with you?

412
00:26:41,444 --> 00:26:42,660
Right Chancellor...

413
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,980
Her Highness will be able to taste

414
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,820
fresh litchis!

415
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,380
If I am lying,

416
00:26:46,577 --> 00:26:48,300
Right Chancellor,
you may cut off my head!

417
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,680
- Get up!
- Right Chancellor!

418
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,710
If I am lying, cut off my head!

419
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,550
Right Chancellor!

420
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,022
Let him come here!

421
00:27:05,244 --> 00:27:06,733
Right Chancellor, allow me to report.

422
00:27:29,288 --> 00:27:30,888
Answer this question first.

423
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,530
How far is it from Lingnan

424
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,380
to Chang'an?

425
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,540
2723.5 km.

426
00:27:36,866 --> 00:27:37,850
Good.

427
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,860
Then

428
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,260
I will give you this opportunity.

429
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,340
Explain to me in full.

430
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,790
Litchis will rot in three days.

431
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,980
How exactly are you going

432
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,620
to transport them
from Lingnan to Chang'an?

433
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,180
However,

434
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,330
you just blocked my path.

435
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,460
According to Tang law,

436
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,180
obstructing or colliding
with an official carriage

437
00:28:05,155 --> 00:28:06,666
warrants 100 strokes.

438
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,050
Even in mitigating circumstances,

439
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,600
it is still 50.

440
00:28:17,266 --> 00:28:19,500
Considering you are serving His Majesty,

441
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,140
I will spare you
that physical punishment.

442
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,380
But the Tang law

443
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,860
cannot be undermined.

444
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:32,660
So here's what we'll do.

445
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:37,980
Let your official robe
bear the punishment in your place.

446
00:28:39,755 --> 00:28:40,980
Thank you, Right Chancellor.

447
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,540
Who is on duty
in this palace corridor today?

448
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,860
Who's on duty?

449
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,900
It is me, Sir.

450
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,690
My humble respects to you,
Right Chancellor.

451
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,340
You failed in your duty.

452
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,430
You will wear his robe

453
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,950
and take his punishment

454
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,580
in his place.

455
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,660
Yes, Sir.

456
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,240
I am sparing you punishment

457
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,711
so that you may explain clearly.

458
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,000
If even one number

459
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,940
is incorrect,

460
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,780
or if anything defies common sense,

461
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:47,288
you know what the result will be.

462
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,860
I would not dare.

463
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,780
Right Chancellor.

464
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:56,700
May I have some tools to write?

465
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,260
Bring a stick!

466
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,620
Here.

467
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,800
Bring him some charcoal.

468
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:21,420
(Ministry of Justice)

469
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,230
What...

470
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:35,500
Scrawling and scribbling on the walls

471
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,100
of the Ministry of Justice?

472
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,850
- Unbelievable.
- Disgraceful!

473
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,300
(March Red)

474
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,180
(Jar)

475
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,660
(Horses)

476
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:15,660
(Able to reach Chang'an in 11 days)

477
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,513
(Day one, the color changes.
Day two, the fragrance fades.)

478
00:31:18,515 --> 00:31:20,260
(Day three, the taste is gone.)

479
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,460
(Chang'an, Gaozhou,
Jiangling, Jizhou, Qianzhou, Lingnan)

480
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,900
(2723.5 km)

481
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,900
50.

482
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,740
Right Chancellor, that's 50.

483
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,140
Keep writing.

484
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,900
(Lingnan)

485
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,260
(Chang'an)

486
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,940
(Arrives in Chang'an in 11 days)

487
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,644
Such effort and dedication.

488
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,380
(Litchi Transport
and Preservation Method)

489
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,580
(Litchi branches are inserted
through the shell into a jar...)

490
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,460
(Place the fruits inside an inner
chamber, seal the opening...)

491
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,020
Right Chancellor.

492
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,200
This is my transport method.

493
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,820
I have poured

494
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,350
my heart and soul

495
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,570
into developing

496
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,420
this method.

497
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,440
Come. All of you, come here.

498
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,780
Come take a look

499
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,940
at Li Shande's transport method.

500
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,200
Excellent!

501
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,140
Very good.

502
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:04,860
Answer me.

503
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,800
According to your method,

504
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,260
how many days will it take
to get the litchis to Chang'an?

505
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,600
11 days.

506
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,660
If you already have

507
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,860
a transport method,

508
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,410
why risk your life

509
00:33:17,555 --> 00:33:20,111
to come see me?

510
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,940
I lack the virtue and strength

511
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,620
to shoulder such a heavy task.

512
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,060
I wish to present this method to you,

513
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:34,622
in the hope that it brings harmony
to the imperial family

514
00:33:34,644 --> 00:33:35,900
and pleases His Majesty.

515
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,320
Then should I bow

516
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,911
and thank you for it?

517
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:41,980
I dare not.

518
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,540
I already hold over 40 positions.

519
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,420
I am already spread too thin.

520
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,600
I appreciate the thought.

521
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,500
Now, get to the point.

522
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,000
What difficulty are you facing?

523
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,700
I have one request,

524
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,900
Right Chancellor.

525
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,060
Transporting litchis is costly.

526
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,910
There is a Lingnan Hu merchant
named Amita

527
00:34:05,955 --> 00:34:07,622
who is willing to contribute
to this effort

528
00:34:07,622 --> 00:34:08,777
as an offering to the court.

529
00:34:08,888 --> 00:34:09,866
Nonsense.

530
00:34:09,888 --> 00:34:11,300
Tang is rich across all four seas.

531
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,200
What need do we have
for a Hu merchant's tribute?

532
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,488
Very well. We will do as you say.

533
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:23,860
What else do you want?

534
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,500
If Attendant Yu from the inner court

535
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,620
could assist me,

536
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,990
this operation would proceed
much more smoothly.

537
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,010
Right Chancellor.

538
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,580
He brought up Attendant Yu.

539
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,860
I'm afraid Attendant Yu intends

540
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,460
to steal this job for himself.

541
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,570
I only care about whether

542
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,940
the litchis can be transported.

543
00:34:46,555 --> 00:34:48,244
This concerns the moods of His Majesty

544
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,180
and Her Highness.

545
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,660
That person you mentioned is busy.

546
00:34:55,755 --> 00:34:57,133
We'll discuss it another time.

547
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,260
Anything else?

548
00:35:00,422 --> 00:35:01,500
No, that's all.

549
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,577
Good. Then do it.

550
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,580
Right Chancellor.

551
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,340
I request clarification.

552
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,350
I carefully reviewed

553
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,220
Mr. Li's proposal.

554
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,370
It is evident

555
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,780
he has indeed put in great effort.

556
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,200
But simply to transport a few litchis,

557
00:35:18,288 --> 00:35:19,933
we must mobilize the entire nation,

558
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,020
dispatching countless riders, horses,

559
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,660
boats, relay stations, and ice storage.

560
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:26,377
I would like to ask Mr. Li.

561
00:35:26,755 --> 00:35:28,620
Where will the money come from?

562
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,140
From the Imperial Treasury, right?

563
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,460
I did some

564
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,300
rough calculations.

565
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,060
Each litchi

566
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,980
would cost

567
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,220
17 guan and 500 coins.

568
00:35:41,533 --> 00:35:43,520
That is enough to buy
a three-year-old male camel

569
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,840
at the West Market.

570
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,100
Or over 12,500 kg grain.

571
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,000
Tang is indeed prosperous.

572
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,333
But even Duke Wei Zheng
once admonished Emperor Taizong

573
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:53,260
not to forget the need for caution
in times of peace.

574
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:54,769
To reject extravagance
and uphold frugality.

575
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,960
This act is like cutting off the roots
to make the tree flourish

576
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,760
while blocking the source
and still expecting the stream to flow.

577
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,933
This year, we transport litchis.
Next year? The year after?

578
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,620
If this continues,

579
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:05,180
it will drain the Imperial Treasury.

580
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:06,900
History will blame us,

581
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,320
officials who failed to speak up.

582
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,360
Not to mention the ongoing wars
in the northwest,

583
00:36:11,488 --> 00:36:13,288
and the Yellow River floods year
after year.

584
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,790
Everywhere needs funding.

585
00:36:15,088 --> 00:36:17,088
If word gets out
that we are raising such a commotion,

586
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:18,822
wasting manpower and wealth

587
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,100
to deliver litchis,

588
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,140
the common folk
will certainly resent us.

589
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,780
The court will draw scorn and infamy.

590
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,820
His Majesty is wise,
and Her Highness is kind.

591
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,820
If they knew the full truth,

592
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,622
surely they would not approve.

593
00:36:30,911 --> 00:36:31,890
I respectfully suggest

594
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:35,460
we first present
a detailed account of the expenses

595
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,620
to His Majesty

596
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,380
and let His Majesty decide.

597
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,300
I concur.

598
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,020
I concur.

599
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,060
- I concur.
- I concur.

600
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,380
I concur. I concur.

601
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,060
I concur. I concur.

602
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,580
Li Shande.

603
00:37:05,911 --> 00:37:07,130
Look at that.

604
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,140
So many people do not want you

605
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,580
to succeed in this task.

606
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,380
What do you think?

607
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,333
I am of the same opinion.

608
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,390
Right Chancellor.

609
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,020
This recent trip to Lingnan
taught me well

610
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,130
how hard the journey is,

611
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,577
and how costly it all becomes.

612
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,020
But this is my duty.

613
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,850
And I must do everything I can
to complete it.

614
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,250
Nevertheless,

615
00:37:42,311 --> 00:37:44,140
if His Majesty wishes
to revoke the order,

616
00:37:44,422 --> 00:37:46,180
that would be a blessing for the nation

617
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,740
and for the people.

618
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,200
"Must."

619
00:37:56,244 --> 00:37:57,820
What a "must" indeed.

620
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:01,500
So reluctant.

621
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,900
So unwilling.

622
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,288
And yet you call this
serving His Majesty?

623
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,540
Sharing His Majesty's burden.

624
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,440
Bringing prosperity to Tang.

625
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,760
These cannot just be words
spoken lightly.

626
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,780
All of you

627
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,380
can only see

628
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,066
a few litchis.

629
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,260
You think Her Highness's litchi banquet

630
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,670
is all pomp, indulgence,

631
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,960
and waste.

632
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,977
Just a matter of repute and prestige.

633
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,940
But not a single one of you

634
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,340
can grasp

635
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,940
His Majesty's intent.

636
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,230
As the saying goes,

637
00:38:56,777 --> 00:38:58,980
"The heavens are high,
and the emperor is far away."

638
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,030
The Tang Dynasty spans a vast territory.

639
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,580
But to transport

640
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,180
fresh litchis

641
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:14,022
from Lingnan to Chang'an,

642
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:16,730
His Majesty

643
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,311
wants the world to see.

644
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,540
No matter

645
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,140
how high the sky,

646
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,700
His Majesty

647
00:39:24,422 --> 00:39:25,822
is never far.

648
00:39:26,088 --> 00:39:27,666
Even with military intelligence,

649
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,820
urgent dispatches

650
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,022
can reach him in no time.

651
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,300
Who then would dare

652
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:37,555
to act recklessly?

653
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,600
A litchi

654
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,220
costs 17 guan and 500 coins.

655
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,140
Can that buy

656
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,880
the same thing in the West Market?

657
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,300
These litchis are not

658
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,340
just about Tang's reputation.

659
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,740
They represent Tang's national strength.

660
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,540
Tang's prestige.

661
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,540
This is Tang's ability
to subdue foreign armies

662
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,220
without lifting a single sword.

663
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,720
Is it not worth it?

664
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,330
His Majesty thinks it is.

665
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,520
I think

666
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,700
it is.

667
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,860
But all you wanted just now

668
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,100
was to earn a name for yourselves

669
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,370
in the history books.

670
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,911
A reputation for righteousness.

671
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:39,820
A petty trick.

672
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,780
But I understand.

673
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,660
No one wants

674
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,800
to carry the burden of blame.

675
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,180
So I will.

676
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,300
I will take the blame!

677
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,200
All of you are innocent.

678
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,870
It was my own doing.

679
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:04,940
To share His Majesty's burdens,

680
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,300
I am heedless

681
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,660
of my own fate.

682
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,340
Li Shande.

683
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:18,980
Now,

684
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,090
can you guarantee these litchis

685
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:22,220
will make it to Chang'an?

686
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,660
If the transport method

687
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,060
can be fully followed,

688
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,155
by the first day of June,

689
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,333
I will deliver the litchis

690
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,540
to you.

691
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:41,590
Good.

692
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,780
Good.

693
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,500
Do it.

694
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,180
Right Chancellor,

695
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,060
could I trouble you
for an official document?

696
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,540
That would make things smoother

697
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,540
when dealing with the various offices.

698
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,060
You already have my token.

699
00:42:11,644 --> 00:42:13,550
That works even better than a document.

700
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,977
If you still have
to go through formalities,

701
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,660
that would damage

702
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,330
my reputation.

703
00:42:20,711 --> 00:42:21,977
But remember this.

704
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,777
When carrying out your duties again,

705
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:28,911
never say you have no choice.

706
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,780
=The Litchi Road=

707
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,600
He actually met the Right Chancellor!

708
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:45,190
He has gained the backing

709
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,540
of the Right Chancellor.

710
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,770
Will he come back

711
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:48,820
to settle scores with us?

712
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,660
Where is Chief Liu?

713
00:42:50,266 --> 00:42:52,488
By tomorrow, none of you
need to show up anymore.

714
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:55,000
If I try to snatch the litchi job again,

715
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,890
I fear

716
00:42:57,511 --> 00:42:59,580
it will provoke his wrath.

717
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,830
- Mr. Li.
- Mr. Li.

718
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,460
- Attendant Yu.
- This time,

719
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,980
I will work alongside you.
