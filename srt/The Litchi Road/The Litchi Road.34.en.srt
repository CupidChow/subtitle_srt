=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,100
(Bloodthirsty Fleas)

3
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,760
Left Chancellor.

4
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,060
(March)

5
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,480
Right Chancellor, you're in a good mood.

6
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,480
Leyou Garden is a royal garden.

7
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,120
His Majesty is busy

8
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,520
and doesn't come here frequently

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,120
but you visit this place often.

10
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:03,680
Left Chancellor, you know nothing.

11
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,520
To protect
His Majesty's favorite peony,

12
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,200
I have to do my best

13
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,840
to care for it.

14
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,000
Even if I have to stay here every day,

15
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,080
it is still my responsibility.

16
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:25,629
Left Chancellor, did you come here

17
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,000
just to say this?

18
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,440
I came here on His Majesty's orders

19
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,520
to ask for forgiveness for my crime.

20
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:50,000
We are both officials
in the imperial court.

21
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,080
Left Chancellor, why must you bow to me?

22
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,160
His Majesty said

23
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,680
you and I
are both pillars of the imperial court.

24
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,520
We should be getting along.

25
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,400
My retainer, Song Wuji, used my name

26
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,400
and flaunted his authority in Lingnan.

27
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,520
He was arrogant, greedy,

28
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,760
and embezzled money.

29
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,160
I heard

30
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,760
the color of the blood bird's nest
he consumed

31
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,777
was even better than His Majesty's.

32
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,800
In the end,

33
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:34,511
I had to trouble you
to punish one of my own.

34
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,080
I feel deeply guilty.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,320
I've come in repentance

36
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,888
and hope you punish me for the crime of

37
00:03:43,911 --> 00:03:46,680
misjudging a person
and failing to see through his conduct.

38
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,760
Left Chancellor,

39
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,920
please stand.

40
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,080
Left Chancellor,

41
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,080
Song Wuji

42
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,280
deserved it.

43
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:04,644
What crimes did you commit,
Left Chancellor?

44
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,480
If news of what you did just now

45
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,720
is spread out,

46
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,622
it will be bad for you.

47
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,080
Everyone has ulterior motives.

48
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,880
If you hadn't let me experience this,

49
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,520
I would not have believed

50
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,679
that there was such a scheming person

51
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,200
among the officials

52
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,440
in the land of Tang.

53
00:04:41,912 --> 00:04:45,392
Left Chancellor, you are knowledgeable.

54
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,160
I've always had a question

55
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,160
to ask you.

56
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,400
Every flower in the Leyou Garden

57
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,000
is pretty

58
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,120
but His Majesty

59
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,640
only likes this old peony.

60
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,960
If someone thinks its beauty
has overshadowed the rest of the flowers

61
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,520
and hindered His Majesty's judgment

62
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,520
so he wants to get rid of it,

63
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,000
do you think

64
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,880
His Majesty should feel happy

65
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,680
or unhappy?

66
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,520
I think

67
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,160
if flowers

68
00:05:36,644 --> 00:05:38,288
are competing against each other

69
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,480
by blooming beautifully,

70
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,520
there's nothing wrong with it.

71
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,160
However,

72
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,680
if we are talking about a flea

73
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,920
that sticks to Chang'an
and sucks Tang's blood,

74
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,800
it will be a different story.

75
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,080
After all, the land
belongs to His Majesty.

76
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,320
Tang also belongs to His Majesty.

77
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,560
If His Majesty finds out one day,

78
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,120
others won't even need to help him...

79
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:17,080
Right Chancellor,

80
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:19,688
you are busy with your duty.
I'm not supposed to disturb you.

81
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,360
Farewell.

82
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,760
Farewell.

83
00:06:21,844 --> 00:06:23,311
I won't be sending you off then.

84
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,020
=Episode 34=

85
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,840
(Litchi Service Notice)
What is this?

86
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:38,888
Order from the Inspector Office.

87
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:40,244
Order from His Majesty.

88
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,960
The office is organizing
a Litchi banquet

89
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,155
to celebrate
the Noble Consort's birthday.

90
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,240
This notice is posted

91
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,800
to gather the people
to serve the imperial court

92
00:06:49,044 --> 00:06:51,355
and celebrate
with His Majesty and the Noble Consort.

93
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,360
It is a blessing for us,
the people of Lingnan

94
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,680
to serve His Majesty
and the Noble Consort.

95
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,760
Everyone, please spare some money...

96
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,120
We don't have any more money!

97
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,960
I beg you. Don't take anymore.

98
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,866
Sir! You can't take anymore.

99
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:08,320
Get lost!

100
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
Spare some for us.

101
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,688
Chief Scribe Zhao.

102
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:33,880
Dear.

103
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,280
Dear, someone is looking for you.

104
00:07:37,288 --> 00:07:38,955
How do you feel? Do you want to vomit?

105
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,120
Chief Scribe Zhao.

106
00:07:40,222 --> 00:07:41,311
Someone is looking for you.

107
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,760
Master, Chief Scribe Zhao is here.

108
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,360
Master Konglang?

109
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,600
Chief Scribe Zhao,

110
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,760
are you looking for this head ornament?

111
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,200
Do you know

112
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,520
why Inspector Yu

113
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,320
wants this head ornament so much?

114
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,360
I don't want to know.

115
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,240
I have no interest

116
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,600
in Inspector Yu's past.

117
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,760
Farewell.

118
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,120
I want to tell you a story.

119
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,240
When I'm done,

120
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,360
perhaps you will change your mind.

121
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,920
Back then,

122
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,120
an evil child

123
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,280
killed a girl

124
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,800
from the same village

125
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,640
to snatch this head ornament from her.

126
00:08:47,244 --> 00:08:49,040
After the parents
of the evil child found out

127
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,880
and punished him,

128
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,200
he burned his parents

129
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,200
in a fire.

130
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:55,151
When he was escaping,

131
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,600
he lost the head ornament

132
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,200
but he falsified

133
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,320
a pitiful background

134
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,280
to sneak into a rich merchant's family.

135
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,320
Coincidentally,

136
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,000
the rich merchant

137
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,680
bought the same head ornament

138
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,320
and gave it to his daughter.

139
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,800
To obtain the head ornament,

140
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,560
the evil child showed ingratitude

141
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,080
and colluded with pirates

142
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,960
to kill
the rich merchant and his family.

143
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,440
In the end,

144
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,240
even the pirates

145
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,529
couldn't stand his cruelty.

146
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,533
The girl castrated the boy
and they didn't intervene.

147
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,200
That made him

148
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,200
enter the palace

149
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,520
and become Inspector Yu.

150
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,680
The pirate back then

151
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,800
was He Youguang.

152
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,680
Master Konglang.

153
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,960
This story is just a legend.

154
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,120
You shouldn't believe
something you hear.

155
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,200
I didn't hear it.

156
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:44,760
I experienced it.

157
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,080
I am

158
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,480
the rich merchant's daughter.

159
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,280
Inspector Yu killed He Youguang

160
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,640
with the Right Chancellor's name

161
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,733
to get his own revenge.

162
00:09:57,755 --> 00:09:59,280
He would never let the Right Chancellor

163
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,400
find out the whole truth.

164
00:10:01,488 --> 00:10:03,500
Chief Scribe Zhao,
as someone who knows about this,

165
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,360
do you think

166
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
he will intend to kill you?

167
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,640
Don't forget.

168
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,680
He is an evil child

169
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,840
who killed his own parents.

170
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,120
If you have a grudge
against Yu Cheng'en,

171
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,560
why not use the opportunity to kill him

172
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,360
and take revenge

173
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,911
when he is in Lingnan?

174
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,240
I'm sure you've realized

175
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,360
my true identity.

176
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,880
I won't lie to you.

177
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,200
I didn't kill him

178
00:10:41,422 --> 00:10:43,000
because I didn't want to raise suspicion

179
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:44,280
and affect the plan in Chang'an.

180
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,840
Moreover, I believe

181
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,600
he'll get what's coming to him.

182
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,800
Chief Scribe Zhao,
you have been ambitious

183
00:10:52,022 --> 00:10:53,866
but pledging your loyalty
to Inspector Yu

184
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,000
isn't a wise choice.

185
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:57,000
He is more ruthless than He Youguang.

186
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,230
He is petty and vengeful,
with absolutely no principles.

187
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,400
In these troubled times,

188
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,480
why don't you find yourself

189
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,711
a backup plan?

190
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,040
I will surely
keep your whole family safe.

191
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:09,920
Of course,

192
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,560
you can also hand this head ornament

193
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,360
to Inspector Yu

194
00:11:14,577 --> 00:11:16,040
and expect him to reward you.

195
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,400
Since this head ornament belongs to you,

196
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,040
please keep it well.

197
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,400
I'll pay
for all of Konglang Guild's fees.

198
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,355
Forget that I'm here today.

199
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,977
Farewell.

200
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,800
Farewell.

201
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,480
Boss.

202
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,120
Look.

203
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,680
Do you have a jar that looks like this?

204
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:54,832
Sorry.

205
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,000
I can't make this.

206
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,800
I don't have this.

207
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,555
No one?

208
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,840
A two-layered one. You don't?

209
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,600
No.

210
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,560
Sorry.

211
00:12:02,177 --> 00:12:02,888
Let me ask you.

212
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,640
Do you have this jar?

213
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,680
Do you have this jar?

214
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,400
I don't.

215
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:13,066
Sorry about that.

216
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,520
Do you have a jar like this?

217
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,377
A two-layered one.

218
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,560
I don't have it here.

219
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,440
I don't think

220
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,000
you can find this in all of Lingnan.

221
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,920
Mr. Li,

222
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,120
you haven't come back for days.

223
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,880
Do I need to make you some food?

224
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,520
Gou'er.

225
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,320
Go out.

226
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,440
I need some time alone.

227
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,920
Mr. Li, you need to eat.

228
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,760
Sure. I'll eat.

229
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,240
I have bamboo rice from Tong.

230
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,000
Go out.

231
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,720
It's not spoiled.

232
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,000
Mr. Li, let me heat it up for you.

233
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,840
Gou'er!

234
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,600
What's wrong, Mr. Li?

235
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,480
Wait.

236
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,440
Wait a second.

237
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,720
All right. Let's go.

238
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,480
Be careful.

239
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,355
All right.

240
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,360
Thank you.

241
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,160
Mr. Li.

242
00:14:23,222 --> 00:14:25,120
Here are the thickest bamboos
you asked for.

243
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,960
What do you think?

244
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,240
It works.

245
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,560
This is it.

246
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,120
Why do you want these bamboos?

247
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:33,524
To keep litchi inside.

248
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,000
Keep litchi inside?

249
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,360
Bamboo likes humid places
and keeps moisture well.

250
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,000
If these bamboos are cut into sections

251
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,120
and drenched in water,

252
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,760
we can put litchi inside

253
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,720
and seal it with mud.

254
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,480
It's just like a two-layered jar.

255
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,520
Lan, help me out.

256
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:49,720
Cut the bamboos
according to their sections.

257
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,320
Come on.

258
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,160
Help me.

259
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,911
All right.

260
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:54,270
(Inspector's Office)
Three baskets of vegetables and fruits.

261
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,240
Two pots.

262
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Three golden teeth.

263
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,640
A set of toiletries.

264
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,680
Lingnan is humid and hot.

265
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,040
We don't have many supplies usually.

266
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,240
Right now, we've even moved

267
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,520
the government supplies here

268
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:10,377
including disaster relief food supplies.

269
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,640
We've gathered 52 horses,

270
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,000
625 stones of food,

271
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:18,520
and we are still counting
the rest of the wares.

272
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,680
This is

273
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,640
a new request
sent by the Right Chancellor.

274
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,240
30 additional clumps
of litchis are added.

275
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,488
Should we follow it?

276
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,840
I will do this myself.

277
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,840
(Li Shande.)

278
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,400
(I'm leaving Lingnan
and returning to the sea.)

279
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,080
(My father wanted to come ashore)

280
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,640
(but when I got ashore, I realized)

281
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,360
(the waves on the shore
were worse than the ones at sea.)

282
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,160
(My father was righteous
his whole life.)

283
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,000
(In the end, he owed the people of Lingnan
because of the Sea Sail Fund.)

284
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,920
(I hope I can help my father pay his debt one day)

285
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,040
(and let Haihu's name stay in Lingnan righteously.)

286
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,840
(Let's meet again if fate allows. Take care.)

287
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,360
Mr. Li!

288
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,280
It's terrible!

289
00:16:27,422 --> 00:16:29,190
There's a huge trouble
at the litchi garden.

290
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,670
- Chop them!
- I asked you not to chop them!

291
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,710
- Don't chop them!
- Stop!

292
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,440
Why are you

293
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,560
chopping our litchi trees?

294
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,000
Ignore her. Keep chopping!

295
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,800
Stop!

296
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,160
Stop!

297
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,240
Stop!

298
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,600
I ask you to stop!

299
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,840
Stop!

300
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,880
All of you, stop!

301
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,000
Inspector Yu, stop!

302
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,600
Stop!

303
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,320
Stop!

304
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,000
Li Shande, they bully me.

305
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:02,933
They are chopping

306
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,480
the litchi trees my parents planted.

307
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,440
I see it.

308
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,680
What's wrong,

309
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,680
Inspector Yu?

310
00:17:09,222 --> 00:17:11,360
Why didn't you prune the trees
according to the rules?

311
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,600
Mr. Li,

312
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,560
the Right Chancellor
has asked for an extra 30 clumps.

313
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,000
Even if he increased 30 clumps,

314
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:31,800
there's no need

315
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,600
to chop all the trees
in the litchi garden.

316
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,840
Mr. Li.

317
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:37,360
The Right Chancellor
asked for 30 clumps.

318
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,520
In the county,

319
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,600
it'll be 100 clumps.

320
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,720
When it comes to this place,

321
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,960
200 clumps are needed

322
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,800
to guarantee the amount.

323
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,480
When a request
comes from the imperial court,

324
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,200
those who execute the order
must obtain some extra

325
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,200
to be safe.

326
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,160
Increasing the amount after every tier.

327
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,240
This has always

328
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,160
been the rule in Chang'an.

329
00:18:02,688 --> 00:18:04,480
Mr. Li,
you've been an official for years.

330
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,000
Have you not been
doing things according to this rule?

331
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,720
The rule is not right.

332
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,600
Now, you are affecting other people.

333
00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:14,240
If you chop all the litchi trees,

334
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,200
what can

335
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,720
the Dong people do next year?

336
00:18:16,866 --> 00:18:18,111
How can they make a living?

337
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,680
I'm the litchi transport envoy.

338
00:18:20,044 --> 00:18:20,766
What I say goes.

339
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,660
The litchi trees cannot be chopped!
I'll take responsibility for everything!

340
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,333
Mr. Li! If this request isn't fulfilled,

341
00:18:25,377 --> 00:18:26,555
both of us will be executed!

342
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,044
Don't you care about your daughter?

343
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,422
What will happen to your daughter?

344
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:43,320
Why are you spacing out?

345
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,080
Chop them!

346
00:18:45,644 --> 00:18:46,422
What should we do?

347
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,911
You can't chop them!

348
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:52,400
You can't chop them!

349
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,200
No!

350
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,066
Don't chop them!

351
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,400
You can't chop them.

352
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,960
You can't chop them.

353
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,720
Li Shande.

354
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:19,800
We started doing experiments with you

355
00:19:19,822 --> 00:19:21,200
a few months ago.

356
00:19:21,488 --> 00:19:23,688
We ran around the city
without sleeping all day.

357
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,320
We trust you so much

358
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,600
and see you as our friend

359
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,960
but you bring

360
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,511
so many disasters to us.

361
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,200
It's all over now.

362
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,120
It's all over.

363
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,600
You said this was a royal orchard.
What about now?

364
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,720
Return the litchi garden to me!

365
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,240
Return the garden to me!

366
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,400
Dear.

367
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,600
Dear, something terrible has happened.

368
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,440
Dear.

369
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:17,320
What's wrong? Are you all right?

370
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:18,880
I'm fine.

371
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,320
I heard Captain Yang
and his family were killed.

372
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,600
They didn't even spare the baby.

373
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,120
Calm down.

374
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,640
Come.

375
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,560
Speak slowly.

376
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,840
Sit down.

377
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,520
Do you feel unwell?

378
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,880
No.

379
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,400
Come and sit.

380
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,080
Take a deep breath.

381
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,080
Breathe with me.

382
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,320
It's fine.

383
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,440
Rumors are everywhere.

384
00:20:50,822 --> 00:20:52,280
They didn't even spare the animals

385
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,080
and blood was everywhere.

386
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,040
They were really vicious.

387
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,800
It was an annihilation of the family.

388
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,760
Dear.

389
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,560
Didn't Inspector Yu

390
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,440
say it was the end

391
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,760
and he wouldn't pursue it further?

392
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,280
It's all right.

393
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,920
Well, I know

394
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,120
he killed He Youguang
because of a personal grudge.

395
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,240
I also expected him not to spare

396
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,266
the former officials
of the Inspector Office.

397
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,240
Trust me.

398
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,640
I have a way to let us stay safe.

399
00:21:32,177 --> 00:21:33,733
Even if the sky is falling down,

400
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,880
I will still hold it up for you.

401
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,920
Zhao Ting.

402
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,400
It's all right.

403
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,840
Your mother was playing a game with you.

404
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,000
You know?

405
00:21:52,088 --> 00:21:54,022
Why do I deserve such a good life

406
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,440
and marry you?

407
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,600
Hurry.

408
00:22:01,431 --> 00:22:04,880
Qilang, wait for me.

409
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,680
It's so late so this must be urgent.

410
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,120
Hurry.

411
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,800
Zhao Xinmin

412
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,933
left himself a backup plan.

413
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,520
He sent us

414
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,866
(Ledger)
He Youguang's ledgers over the year.

415
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,600
This is great.

416
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,320
Everything is clear now.

417
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,240
With this evidence,

418
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,440
we will succeed soon.

419
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,640
Depart immediately

420
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,200
and bring the evidence to Chang'an.

421
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,880
Remember to hand it over

422
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,240
to Deputy Director Lu yourself.

423
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,800
Luotuo will escort you.

424
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,440
Yes.

425
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,680
Can you agree to a request of mine?

426
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,200
Tell me about it.

427
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,880
Since I came to Lingnan,

428
00:22:51,488 --> 00:22:53,340
I've been trying to invite you
to drink with me

429
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,040
but I haven't gotten my wish.

430
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,600
When this is over,

431
00:22:58,266 --> 00:22:59,800
I will return to Lingnan.

432
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:00,960
At that time,

433
00:23:01,155 --> 00:23:02,820
I'm no longer
the Right Chancellor's envoy

434
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:04,488
and you are no longer Master Konglang.

435
00:23:04,555 --> 00:23:05,760
I won't even bring him along.

436
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,400
We are just Zheng Ping'an and Yun Qing.

437
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,800
Can we drink together?

438
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,800
Deal.

439
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,320
Deal.

440
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,980
(Wine)

441
00:23:32,022 --> 00:23:33,320
Why are you drinking alone?

442
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,720
The Softshell Turtle On Top...

443
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,360
I trusted him so much.

444
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,280
The Softshell Turtle On Top

445
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,920
is just a turtle!

446
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,440
Everyone treats me well

447
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,240
and I hurt everyone.

448
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,280
This is not your fault.

449
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,640
The root of evil

450
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,840
is the Right Chancellor.

451
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,000
I can't let them get their wish.

452
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,120
I can't let them get their wish.

453
00:24:22,969 --> 00:24:23,567
Shande,

454
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,480
you mustn't act recklessly.

455
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,022
If you offend the Right Chancellor,

456
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,200
you will die.

457
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,280
I'm going back to Chang'an tonight.

458
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,240
I've gotten what I want.

459
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,555
This time, I will surely
get rid of the Right Chancellor.

460
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,120
Giddy up!

461
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,880
Inspector Yu,

462
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:31,440
Chief Scribe Zhao sent a letter

463
00:25:31,466 --> 00:25:33,149
saying he couldn't
find the head ornament.

464
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,860
The servants and maids
who worked that night

465
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,200
said they didn't see it as well.

466
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,040
Kill everyone
who was working that night.

467
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,400
No one can take something

468
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,800
that I can't obtain.

469
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,200
Yes.

470
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,080
How's Li Shande?

471
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,320
Preparation for

472
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,911
the transport of litchi is almost done.

473
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,800
However, Mr. Li

474
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,350
must depart ahead of the transport team

475
00:26:27,355 --> 00:26:28,977
to remove any obstacles along the way.

476
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,520
Pack up.

477
00:26:32,111 --> 00:26:33,120
We will follow him.

478
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:36,088
Nothing can go wrong

479
00:26:36,088 --> 00:26:37,240
with the transportation.

480
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,160
I will only be relieved
if I follow them.

481
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,760
I... I'm returning to Chang'an.

482
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,440
I want to speak to Tong.

483
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,120
The chief says

484
00:26:55,311 --> 00:26:56,888
she doesn't want to see you.

485
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,120
Help me tell Tong

486
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,600
that I'm going back

487
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,360
and give everyone

488
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,520
a satisfactory explanation.

489
00:27:17,111 --> 00:27:18,288
I won't go back on my promise.

490
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,600
I am

491
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,120
willing to give all my assets

492
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,320
to you!

493
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,800
Share weal and woe with you.

494
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,720
We will now go to the mountains,

495
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,760
and pick the strongest litchi tree

496
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,680
to get its branch for grafting,

497
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,480
all right?

498
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,920
All right!

499
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,400
Let's go!

500
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,311
Let's go!

501
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,700
(Border Market Bureau)

502
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,040
Mr. Su.

503
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,360
Come.

504
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,920
Slowly. Slowly.

505
00:29:13,755 --> 00:29:15,333
The official document's matter

506
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:16,955
will not be pursued further.

507
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,800
Why did you do this?

508
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,560
A true talent knows when to yield.

509
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,360
A true hero knows how to adapt.

510
00:29:24,533 --> 00:29:26,200
If you hand over the two-layered jars,

511
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:28,022
you can protect something at least.

512
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,880
Look at you now.

513
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:30,200
You lose more than you get.

514
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,520
It's all an illusion in the end

515
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,960
and your efforts are futile.

516
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,720
This...

517
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,080
That's how you use an idiom.

518
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,720
There's no use being angry.

519
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,320
Go back and be more cultured.

520
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,600
Go.

521
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,960
I'm not being angry.

522
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,560
I'm gambling on humanity.

523
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:55,800
Fine.

524
00:30:06,644 --> 00:30:07,955
It's all over now.

525
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,080
Li Shande has departed
with the litchi transportation team.

526
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,280
I think he should be in Chang'an by now.

527
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,880
(I forgot how long ago it was.)

528
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,880
(I was attracted
by a vibrant peacock feather)

529
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,240
(and sailed all the way
to Tang to make a living.)

530
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,520
(With luck on my side,
I became the chief of Hu merchants.)

531
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,640
(Right now, everything is just a dream.)

532
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,622
(This feather is all I have.)

533
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,311
(It's time for me to return home.)

534
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,844
Give me another bowl.

535
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,920
Sure.

536
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,480
Mr. Li.

537
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,560
We've left the Shangzhou Circuit now.

538
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,320
We'll arrive at Lantian soon.

539
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,280
Tomorrow morning, we'll be in Chang'an.

540
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,080
From Lingnan to this place,

541
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,760
99% of the litchi

542
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,000
was ruined for various reasons.

543
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,680
A huge team

544
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,200
departed from Gaozhou

545
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,440
but only a few horses

546
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,360
arrived in Chang'an.

547
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,840
I know you are kind, Mr. Li.

548
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,120
You have a good relationship

549
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,000
with the Dong people.

550
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,760
However, we can't go against

551
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,960
His Majesty's order.

552
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,680
We are not saints.

553
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,560
We shouldn't consider

554
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,400
the fate of the common people.

555
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,640
Doing our job well

556
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,600
is already difficult enough.

557
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,680
Wasting your energy

558
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,511
on the common people
who are unimportant

559
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,480
and losing your life for it

560
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,022
will make you into a joke.

561
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,560
As for the litchi garden,
if we didn't chop the trees,

562
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,533
we wouldn't be able
to fulfill this request.

563
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:15,930
Giddy up!

564
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,570
Giddy up!

565
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:26,880
Mr. Li,

566
00:33:27,044 --> 00:33:28,930
I rushed here
as soon as I received your letter.

567
00:33:28,933 --> 00:33:30,044
Do you think this is enough?

568
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,911
It's enough.

569
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,000
Thank you.

570
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,755
Everyone, it's like this.

571
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,320
When we left Lingnan,

572
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,160
the litchis

573
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,520
were still green

574
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,640
so it doesn't rot on the way here.

575
00:33:44,132 --> 00:33:46,252
Now that Chang'an is near,

576
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,520
we need apples to ripen it.

577
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,000
Later,

578
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,280
put two apples

579
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,240
in each bamboo basket

580
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,160
so His Majesty and the Noble Consort

581
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,280
can enjoy the sweetest litchis.

582
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:57,155
All right?

583
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,480
Yes.

584
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,044
Come on.

585
00:33:59,088 --> 00:34:00,155
Let's do it.

586
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,600
Yan.

587
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:05,920
I want you

588
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,200
to rush to Chang'an

589
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,840
and give this to the address.

590
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,240
Remember.

591
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,822
You must reach Chang'an before us.

592
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,600
Yes.

593
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,720
Gou'er!

594
00:34:22,888 --> 00:34:23,888
Look!

595
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,760
Luotuo!

596
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,280
Giddy up!

597
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:54,660
(Memorial Tablet of Zheng Weifeng
and his wife, Zhang)

598
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:57,111
When my father was in trouble back then,

599
00:34:57,288 --> 00:34:59,777
everyone in the Zheng family
only stood by and watched.

600
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,160
I no longer yearn

601
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,920
to return to such an arrogant family.

602
00:35:10,177 --> 00:35:11,911
When the Right Chancellor is toppled,

603
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,240
I can avenge

604
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,680
your spirit, Father.

605
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,280
Don't worry, Zheng.

606
00:35:42,644 --> 00:35:44,355
The Left Chancellor
and the Deputy Director

607
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:46,111
will get rid of the corrupt officials.

608
00:35:46,866 --> 00:35:49,133
However,
the Right Chancellor still holds power.

609
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,360
Your identity still holds danger.

610
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,688
You still need to be careful.

611
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,240
Who is it?

612
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,190
Please send a message.

613
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,280
Zheng Ping'an is requesting
a meeting with Deputy Director Lu

614
00:36:15,288 --> 00:36:16,377
to tell him something urgent.

615
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:17,640
Wait here.

616
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,580
(First Day of June)

617
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,080
Congratulations, Right Chancellor.

618
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,360
I've fulfilled the request

619
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,080
and brought back the litchis.

620
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:17,840
Good.

621
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,720
It's done in 11 days indeed.

622
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,600
You've done well.

623
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,720
Open the box and show me.

624
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,760
Yes.

625
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,520
It's so fresh.

626
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,333
Right Chancellor.

627
00:37:38,488 --> 00:37:39,755
These are for

628
00:37:39,755 --> 00:37:41,040
His Majesty and the Noble Consort.

629
00:37:41,044 --> 00:37:42,044
Please take a look.

630
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,920
Good.

631
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,480
The gifts to Tang

632
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,760
by other nations

633
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,600
might be surpassed

634
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,600
by these

635
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,840
small, fresh litchis.

636
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,400
Exactly!

637
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,240
Wonderful!

638
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,777
Cover the box.

639
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:03,120
Both of you have done well
in transporting the litchis.

640
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,894
I've asked His Majesty

641
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,640
to invite both of you
to attend the banquet.

642
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,244
Thank His Majesty.

643
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,533
Thank you, Right Chancellor.

644
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,450
Thank you for your blessing,
Right Chancellor.

645
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,400
I've been rushing here for days

646
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,400
and isn't well-groomed.

647
00:38:17,511 --> 00:38:19,933
I'm afraid it might
scare His Majesty and the Noble Consort.

648
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,160
It's fine.

649
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:26,480
Looking like this shows your loyalty.

650
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,160
Am I right, Inspector Yu?

651
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,080
You are correct, Right Chancellor.

652
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:31,760
Come.

653
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,760
Get up.

654
00:38:32,888 --> 00:38:34,533
Thank you, Right Chancellor.

655
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,880
(The Consort Noble knows
His Majesty doesn't like lavishness)

656
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,040
(and asks for this year's birthday)

657
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,640
(to be as simple as possible.)

658
00:38:56,266 --> 00:38:58,222
(The purpose
is just to enjoy the flowers.)

659
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,600
(Flowers are pretty)

660
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,880
(but they are precious
because someone appreciates them.)

661
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,720
(It is a blessing for the kingdom)

662
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,880
(and its people.)

663
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,400
Mr. Li, take a look.

664
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,160
I'm sure you don't recognize

665
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,880
the Leyou Garden today.

666
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,560
It has been utterly transformed.

667
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,440
Mr. Li.

668
00:39:55,444 --> 00:39:57,120
That's not the right way to describe it.

669
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,960
The Right Chancellor has exquisite taste

670
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,360
and has decorated

671
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,160
the Leyou Garden to be so magnificent.

672
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,400
The Noble Consort's birthday banquet

673
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,680
will surely be an event

674
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,160
that the people
will talk about for ages.

675
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,320
Right Chancellor,

676
00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:15,639
His Majesty has left the palace

677
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,880
and is coming to Leyou Garden.

678
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,080
He will be here soon.

679
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,400
Good.

680
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,760
Right Chancellor,

681
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,040
can I

682
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,080
ask you a question?

683
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,880
Mr. Li,

684
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,320
you are a hardworking person.

685
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,040
At my place,

686
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,680
people who are capable like him

687
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,040
will never be neglected.

688
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,680
Look at the fresh litchis.

689
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,400
It must be made into a yearly event.

690
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,520
In the future,

691
00:40:50,977 --> 00:40:53,280
you are still the Litchi Envoy.

692
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,177
Later,
I'll ask the Ministry of Personnel

693
00:40:55,177 --> 00:40:56,666
to transfer you to the Carriage Bureau.

694
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,840
You'll be promoted in the future.

695
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,560
Be patient.

696
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,720
Good days are coming for you.

697
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,480
That's not what I want to ask about.

698
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,880
A lot of money is spent
on litchi transportation.

699
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,800
Money might not be my concern

700
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,880
but I still feel worried.

701
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,400
Please explain the situation to me.

702
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,160
His Majesty and the Noble Consort

703
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,080
are arriving soon.

704
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,640
Must you ask me

705
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,160
to explain it to you right now?

706
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:27,880
Exactly.

707
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,720
Transportation of litchi

708
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,640
has used up 20,000 guan.

709
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,160
The average cost

710
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,120
to transport one litchi
from Lingnan to Chang'an

711
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,320
is 100 guan.

712
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,080
100 guan

713
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,960
is ten years' worth of income

714
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,000
for a normal family.

715
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,400
That means

716
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,480
every litchi

717
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,520
eaten by a noble

718
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,960
on this banquet here

719
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,960
costs a year's worth of income

720
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,280
for ten families.

721
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,000
Where does the money come from?

722
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,480
I saw the money

723
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,520
being extorted
from Lingnan's litchi gardens,

724
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,680
and the residences on the way here.

725
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,400
The money was extracted

726
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,200
from the people of Tang.

727
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,320
As a chancellor, one should govern

728
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,533
and balance all matters.

729
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,920
How do you balance

730
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,760
the importance of litchis
and the kingdom, Right Chancellor?

731
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,160
Which is more important

732
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,200
to His Majesty?

733
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,800
I told you

734
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:30,240
about the good and bad
of litchi transportation.

735
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,360
Why are you asking

736
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,488
such a muddled question?

737
00:42:33,533 --> 00:42:35,000
I've never been so enlightened.

741
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,480
and the Noble Consort are happy,

742
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,000
I will be satisfied.

743

744
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,040
