We really have grown distant.

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,150
Lingnan is a land of scarcity.

Yun Qing,

12
00:03:13,355 --> 00:03:14,710
come back to Chang'an with me.

13
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,400
The Konglang Guild
is running smoothly now.

14
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,710
I've found someone

15
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,680
to take your place.

16

19
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:35,622
Though you enjoy more freedom here
than in Chang'an,

20
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,910
it is remote and isolated.

21
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,590
If your identity is exposed,

22
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,400
I will worry.

23
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,240
I've acquired a residence
in Pingkang Ward.

stay there for a while.

26
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,630
That means

27
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,470
I'll no longer be Master Konglang.

I'll leave tomorrow.

Keep it.

37

Then once everything is done,

38
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,390
I'll come back for you.

42
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,488
First, we pick up my daughter.

43
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,630
Such a majestic beard you have, Sir.

44
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,390
It'd be a shame to cut it.

45
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,950
Even I hesitate

46
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,920
to remove it.

47
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,870
Do it.

Last night,

53
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,950
I dreamed of my father.

54
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,600
His beard was long.

55
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,190
His temples were streaked with white.

56
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:25,577
His face was covered in dust.

57
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,510
He looked much more worn
than when he was in Chang'an.

58
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,150
He was standing
outside Hongni Embroidery.

00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,622
I'll grant you a day off.

192
00:14:22,955 --> 00:14:23,777
Thank you kindly.

193
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:24,720
I'm off.

194
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:43,840
Sir.

195
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,840
What brings you

196
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,270
(Ministry of Revenue)
to the Ministry of Revenue today?

197
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,550
His Majesty assigned me a task.

198
00:14:52,077 --> 00:14:54,510
After traveling for over a month,
my funds are nearly exhausted.

199
00:14:54,511 --> 00:14:56,600
I have come
to request additional provisions.

200
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:59,400
Are you here to see the Director
of the Bureau of General Accounts

201
00:14:59,444 --> 00:15:00,440
or the Vice Director?

202
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,870
All the officials are quite busy.

203
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,240
Did you make an appointment

204
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,080
in advance?

205
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,755
I just returned to Chang'an.

206
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,600
I haven't...

207
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,200
Then this is just an inquiry.

208
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,790
You can speak

209
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,720
with the official in charge
of disbursement.

210
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,750
Follow these two

211
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,750
in a moment.

212
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,720
Right this way, please.

213
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,960
- All right.
- Please.

214
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,480
Please go in.

215
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,030
You're early, Wang.

216
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,720
I wanted to be early too.

217
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,044
But the carriages got jammed again
at West Market Entrance.

218
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:45,000
That place is packed every day.

219
00:15:45,022 --> 00:15:46,330
Yet, you insist on going that way.

220
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,250
Who else can you blame?

221
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440
That's right.

222
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,600
Excuse me.

223
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,866
Is it always like this
at the Ministry of Revenue?

224
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,870
You look

225
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,030
unfamiliar.

226
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,066
It's my first time here.

227
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,870
I figured.

228
00:16:26,022 --> 00:16:27,349
You only got here at this hour.

229
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,377
You didn't even
bring your own folding stool.

230
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,240
Today is already a slow day.

231
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:36,840
Will I be able to get my turn today?

232
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:37,840
Yes.

233
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
Just wait in line.

234
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,555
I think your luck's good today.

235
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,870
Once it's your turn,

236
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,120
hand in your petition,

237
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,200
then answer

238
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,630
the officer's questions carefully.

239
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:50,577
With luck, you might even
get what you came for by tomorrow.

240
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,377
So, I can't get it done today?

241
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,910
If you had queued up

242
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,440
first thing

243
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,720
this morning,

244
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,680
and your matter

245
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,510
was not too complicated,

246
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,266
maybe.

247
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,400
That's not enough.

248
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,720
You also need the officer on duty to be

249
00:17:12,844 --> 00:17:13,800
in a good mood.

250
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,110
Maybe he just got paid.

251
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,377
Or just married.

252
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,480
As long as he is happy,

253
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,755
your case will go smoothly.

254
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,110
Only when timing,
luck, and people all align

255
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:29,400
can something be done in a day.

256
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,750
If not, you'll be here

257
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,240
for four or five days.

258
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,510
Have patience, Sir.

259
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,333
Everyone's waiting. Please be patient.

260
00:17:41,377 --> 00:17:42,644
He came from the palace.

261
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,750
There are streams of people
coming here every day.

262
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,510
Just one disbursement officer

263
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,070
from the Ministry of Revenue?

264
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,480
Can they not assign more people

265
00:17:54,488 --> 00:17:55,480
to share the load?

266
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,711
Share the load?

267
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,920
From the Department
of State Affairs down,

268
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,200
then to the Vice Ministers,

269
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,750
the Directors, and Vice Directors,

270
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,720
and then to all the officials
in the Bureau of General Accounts.

271
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,688
Everyone has their own rank and duties.

272
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:08,666
Who exactly would you like
to share the load?

273
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,030
The Director?

274
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,488
Or the Vice Director?

275
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,480
I wouldn't dare.

276
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,680
I'm not even worthy

277
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:15,570
to request an audience
with such officials.

278
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,720
Exactly. Since that's the case,

279
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,200
best to go with the flow.

280
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,400
So

281
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,680
you all know how it works.

282
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,480
Why show up

283
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,088
so late today?

284
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,720
We're always on edge

285
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,200
in our respective offices.

286
00:18:32,355 --> 00:18:33,639
Even the slightest misstep,

287
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,422
and we'll get an earful
from our superiors.

288
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:37,422
Whereas here, we can loosen up
and take it easy.

289
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,480
That's right.

290
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,400
Rather than rushing
to finish things in a day,

291
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,333
better to space them out
over three days.

292
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,880
And if luck is not on your side,

293
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,750
maybe four or five.

294
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,960
In our superiors' eyes,

295
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:51,160
we're working tirelessly

296
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,110
for official duties.

297
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,160
Meanwhile,

298
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,480
our days pass quite comfortably.

299
00:19:08,777 --> 00:19:11,311
This osmanthus tree seems to be
nearing the end of its life.

300
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,070
Nonsense.

301
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,960
That tree is a symbol of loyalty
and righteousness.

302
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,400
You don't know
what you're talking about.

303
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,000
Why call it that?

304
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,030
When my father received
His Majesty's decree

305
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,920
and left Chang'an, he told me

306
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,960
that he would return

307
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,800
when the osmanthus tree bloomed again.

308
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,270
This tree knows

309
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,720
that his journey

310
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,550
will be full of hardship and danger.

311
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,155
So it has held back its blossoms.

312
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,830
It's trying

313
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,350
to buy him more time

314
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,240
so that he doesn't break

315
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,720
his promise to me.

316
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,830
Hearing you say that,

317
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,350
this tree does deserve its title.

318
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,480
How did you meet

319
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,680
my father?

320
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,310
When your father

321
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,750
first came to Lingnan,

322
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,920
he ruined my business

323
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,200
and turned Lingnan upside down.

324
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,550
Hard not to know him.

325
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,240
But my father said you were his friend.

326
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,110
Later, I ran into trouble.

327
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,480
Your father helped me

328
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,440
leave Lingnan.

329
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,160
He's a good man.

330
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,110
But he was

331
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,350
on an imperial mission.

332
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,830
He was racing against time.

333
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,510
And he still helped you?

334
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,590
That's why I say

335
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,550
your father has a kind heart.

336
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,240
I'm grateful to him.

337
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,510
That isn't necessary.

338
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,030
My father is kind.

339
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,440
Be it a stray, a plant,

340
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,680
or a person.

341
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,000
He'd save any life he could.

342
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:05,880
Moving?

343
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,350
My father

344
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,790
sold this house

345
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,440
to buy medicine

346
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,511
for my mother.

347
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,680
But he never

348
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,790
let go of her.

349
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,830
So, he saved up to buy it back.

350
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,110
My mother planted

351
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,590
this osmanthus tree herself.

352
00:21:28,311 --> 00:21:29,920
There aren't many men like your father

353
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,110
who still hold on

354
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,000
to such deep feelings.

355
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,880
He only spoils me

356
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,266
and my mother.

357
00:21:36,288 --> 00:21:37,590
With others, he's stingy.

358
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,750
His boots had holes in the soles,

359
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,400
and he still wouldn't throw them away.

360
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:42,044
He told me,

361
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,070
"Heaven knows not, Earth knows not,

362
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,830
others know not, only I know."

363
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:48,790
Also,

364
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,480
every time he buys osmanthus cakes,

365
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,830
he hesitates

366
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,440
and dithers.

367
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,480
But really, he already decided.

368
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,088
He's just picking up the pieces
of candied osmanthus that fell off.

369
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,350
Only your father could be

370
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,400
that calculating.

371
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:05,720
Still,

372
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,000
even if he is frugal,

373
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,270
he is a man with a heart.

374
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,680
He saved

375
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,222
all that money just for you.

376
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,680
He's not just stingy.

377
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,960
He's old too.

378
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,830
So what?

379
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,800
Few in this world have a heart

380
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,480
as pure as his.

381
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,830
To have seen so much of the world

382
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:28,155
and still keep a childlike sincerity,
is rare indeed.

383
00:22:28,177 --> 00:22:29,830
I'm tired. I don't want to talk.

384
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,000
Is Li Shande back?

385
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,720
I saw someone moving things
into that mansion,

386
00:22:38,244 --> 00:22:39,880
but I did not see Li Shande himself.

387
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,400
I did see a woman, though.

388
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,830
It looked like his daughter
was there too.

389
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,240
A woman?

390
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,070
Madam Shiqi.

391
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,110
We did

392
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,070
a good deed for Li Shande

393
00:22:55,088 --> 00:22:57,622
so he could make a fresh start
and return to Chang'an.

394
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,200
We must seize this chance

395
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,888
and collect the blessings we are owed.

396
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,880
Otherwise,

397
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:05,960
he might just squander it all

398
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,270
on that woman.

399
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,200
You're right.

400
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,750
If he has money for women,

401
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,000
he should have money

402
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,550
to repay us too.

403
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,270
Since Li Shande refuses to show himself,

404
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,640
bring that woman to me.

405
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,680
I want to have

406
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,160
a proper talk with her.

407
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,030
Gentlemen,

408
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,750
it is nearly midday.

409
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,550
We can only

410
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,830
process one more today.

411
00:23:46,044 --> 00:23:47,755
The rest will have to return tomorrow.

412
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,160
What? Only one more?

413
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,880
We've all been waiting
the whole morning.

414
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,480
There are only a few of us left.
Why not finish processing everyone?

415
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,169
That's right.

416
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,110
Each of you only manages

417
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,400
your own duties,

418
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,590
but the disbursement officer
has to handle everything.

419
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,680
He would love
to help all of you in one go,

420
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,720
but his health can hardly keep up.

421
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,400
There are so many people around.

422
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:05,790
I can't tell who came first.

423
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,960
Perhaps you can choose someone

424
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,000
among yourselves?

425
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,270
Me! Look.

426
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,920
Some matters are more urgent
than others.

427
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,550
Let the more critical cases go first.

428
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,640
The rest can wait.

429
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,822
I really have an emergency!

430
00:24:15,866 --> 00:24:16,440
Listen to you.

431
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,660
Whose business is not urgent?

432
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,240
I've been overseeing the cleaning
of the Chang'an drainage system.

433
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,555
I've been here five or six times.

434
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,259
If we delay again and it rains hard,

435
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,622
we'll have filth flowing
through the streets of Chang'an!

436
00:24:25,644 --> 00:24:26,240
Can you all

437
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,880
just imagine that?

438
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,880
You're right.

439
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,920
That is urgent.

440
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,110
My case is urgent too.

441
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,977
The gate at the West Market
has fallen into disrepair for years.

442
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:37,660
Today, a beam fell
and hit an official on the head.

443
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:39,239
Traffic on the streets of West Market

444
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,555
was backed up for two whole hours.

445
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,640
If we do not repair it now,

446
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,640
it could collapse someday
and kill someone!

447
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,310
Just imagine that scene!

448
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,240
That's an emergency indeed.

449
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,030
That is serious.

450
00:24:48,044 --> 00:24:50,200
Compared to the two of you
with your urgent matters,

451
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,777
my task of transporting litchis

452
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,200
does seem less pressing.

453
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,200
Who are you?

454
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,070
Litchi...

455
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,480
You're the Litchi Envoy?

456
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,160
So you are the Litchi Envoy!

457
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,680
He's the Litchi Envoy!

458
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,729
The Litchi Envoy! Mr. Li!

459
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,160
- An honor to finally meet you.
- An honor to finally meet you.

460
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,310
You all know who I am?

461
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,960
How could we not?

462
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,640
I work at the Food Bureau.

463
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,550
That assignment notice
was sent to us first,

464
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,790
but no one dared take it.

465
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,310
Later we heard that this cursed mission

466
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,555
was accepted by you.

467
00:25:15,577 --> 00:25:16,960
I felt nothing but admiration.

468
00:25:16,977 --> 00:25:18,680
Though I never had the chance
to meet you.

469
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,550
There's talk that your colleagues

470
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,933
at the Shanglin Office set you up

471
00:25:21,933 --> 00:25:22,880
with that job.

472
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,310
I never believed

473
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,110
that story.

474
00:25:25,155 --> 00:25:26,110
Setting a trap like that

475
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,200
is no easy feat.

476
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,440
It takes a group effort

477
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,550
with absolute secrecy to pull it off.

478
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,480
If even

479
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,640
one person leaks word,

480
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,200
the plan fails.

481
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,350
Do you mean you didn't have
a single trustworthy colleague

482
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,880
at the Shanglin Office?

483
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,720
One should not believe

484
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,640
every rumor

485
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,350
on the street.

486
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,720
Then,

487
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,000
did you ask for this job yourself?

488
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,310
Well, it's a long story.

489
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,000
Did someone get something on you

490
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,310
and force your hand?

491
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,240
Tell us the whole story.

492
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,510
Yes. Tell us.

493
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,644
There is nothing to share.

494
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,750
Since you took on this job,

495
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,480
should you not be down in Lingnan...

496
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,720
Toiling to transport those litchis?

497
00:26:07,288 --> 00:26:09,250
How do you even have time
to be back in Chang'an?

498
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,640
That's exactly why I'm here.

499
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:11,880
To handle this matter.

500
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,680
Right. Right.

501
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,400
Everyone.

502
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,400
Has someone been chosen?

503
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,080
The disbursement officer
is still waiting.

504
00:26:20,088 --> 00:26:21,110
If there's no one else,

505
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,030
he shall be off duty.

506
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,960
Let Mr. Li go first.

507
00:26:24,977 --> 00:26:26,511
His matter is more urgent than mine.

508
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:27,880
After you.

509
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,790
Please.

510
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,240
Mr. Li.

511
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,270
Please go ahead.

512
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,920
(Chief Clerk of the Ministry of Revenue)
So you are the Litchi Envoy?

513
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,350
Seems my identity is now known

514
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,720
all over the court.

515
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,866
What are you doing here looking for me?

516
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,790
The nation's finances

517
00:26:50,888 --> 00:26:52,240
are under the Ministry of Revenue.

518
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,510
That is why I came.

519
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,666
You're His Majesty's
appointed Litchi Envoy.

520
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:02,070
You don't need to be
bogged down by protocol.

521
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,288
You can leave.

522
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,350
There's no need for this
to go through me.

523
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,640
Sir,

524
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,640
if this were a regular assignment,

525
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,680
I could bypass the formalities

526
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,000
and go straight
to the Imperial Treasury.

527
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,270
But transporting litchis

528
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,000
requires more than just money.

529
00:27:19,022 --> 00:27:21,440
It also demands tight coordination
among multiple departments.

530
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,550
So this task does need

531
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,720
to go through

532
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,160
the ministry's formal process.

533
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,960
Very well.
I will process it accordingly.

534
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,680
Yes, please.

535
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,880
First off,

536
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,960
your handwriting is too messy.

537
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,240
How did you even pass

538
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,622
the Ministry of Personnel's exam?

539
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,044
It was an urgent matter.
I ask for your understanding.

540
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:48,480
The Ministry of Personnel
evaluates officials on four criteria.

541
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,880
Appearance, speech,
handwriting, and judgment.

542
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:54,070
Your appearance is haggard,

543
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,680
your voice is hoarse,

544
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,933
and your writing is chaotic.

545
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,680
That's three out of four failed already.

546
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,110
As for your judgment,

547
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,244
how many litchis
are you transporting to Chang'an?

548
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,640
Whether it's a single fruit
or two entire jars,

549
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,400
it all costs the same.

550
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,920
And how many litchis
are in those two jars?

551
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,000
40.

552
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,790
Do you know

553
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,000
for transporting taxes or corvée goods
from Henan to the capital,

554
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,720
the official cost
is 50 kg per mule-load,

555
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,000
and 100 coins per 150 km?

556
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,110
Mountain routes are 120 coins.

557
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,550
Now you're telling me that transporting
a few litchis from Lingnan

558
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,720
costs 700 guan?

559
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,400
That is way too much.

560
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,000
It averages out

561
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:46,355
to 17 guan and 500 coins per litchi.

562
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,200
The price

563
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,350
of a three-year-old foreign
Bactrian camel

564
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,480
in the West Market

565
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,310
does not even reach 15 guan.

566
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,960
Do you take me for a fool?

567
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,888
The transportation method

568
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,070
I designed

569
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,160
is very fast.

570
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,960
Its only drawback

571
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,720
is the high cost.

572
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,800
As long as you are aware.

573
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,790
But this cost cannot be absorbed.

574
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,750
Back in the day,

575
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,920
Pei Yaoqing built
river ports and canals.

576
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,000
Though the cost was huge,

577
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,590
the benefit

578
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,000
could be amortized over years.

579
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,510
But your litchi transport requires more,

580
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,070
including horses,

581
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:32,030
ice, manpower,

582
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,680
equipment, coordination,

583
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,711
work hours.

584
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,110
All one-time use.

585
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,680
Next time, you start from scratch again.

586
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,270
There are litchis in Luzhou too.

587
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,270
Why not get them from there?

588
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,880
Do you have relatives

589
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,070
in Lingnan or something?

590
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,200
His Majesty specifically commanded

591
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,844
that the litchis come from Lingnan.

592
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,550
I'm simply carrying out the order.

593
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,400
You're following the imperial order.

594
00:29:57,488 --> 00:29:59,066
I'm following the administrative rules.

595
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,590
I can't approve this request.

596
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:02,680
Sir,

597
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,070
I have been in Lingnan for over a month

598
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,510
exhausting my efforts.

599
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,920
I have already

600
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,400
persuaded merchants

601
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,750
to donate voluntarily.

602
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,510
I've saved the court a lot of money.

603
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,680
Save money with one hand,

604
00:30:15,755 --> 00:30:17,600
and they'll want tax breaks
with the other.

605
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,750
In the end,
it is the merchants who benefit,

606
00:30:20,822 --> 00:30:22,311
and the court who bears the burden.

607
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,440
This was a task assigned
by His Majesty himself.

608
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,555
You refuse to approve it?

609
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,590
Let me explain.

610
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,310
The Ministry of Revenue
may control the budget,

611
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,960
but we merely act under orders

612
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,555
from the higher officials.

613
00:30:42,755 --> 00:30:44,690
The same applies
when you go to the apothecary.

614
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,790
You need the physician
to write the prescription

615
00:30:46,977 --> 00:30:48,750
before the assistant can dispense

616
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,640
the medicine.

617
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,350
Bring me a signed directive
from the Secretariat,

618
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,000
and I'll process it without delay.

619
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,790
But did you not just say

620
00:30:58,911 --> 00:31:00,688
that as His Majesty's appointed envoy,

621
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,440
I need not follow all these rules?

622
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,000
Mr. Li,

623
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,310
I said it didn't need to go through me.

624
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:12,466
But you insisted on going by the book.

625
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:16,288
Now that I am going by the book,
you are breaking the rules.

626
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,110
I am but a disbursement officer

627
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,155
doing my job.

628
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,960
Why make things difficult

629
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,720
for an old man?

630
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,720
If you have what it takes,

631
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,720
raise your concerns

632
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,222
in the Hall of State Affairs
with the senior ministers instead.

633
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,577
Left Chancellor,

634
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,030
according to Yun Qing,

635
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,960
He Youguang has already destroyed
all the evidence

636
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,000
that woman was holding.

637
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,510
He Youguang's letter of allegiance alone

638
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:52,466
is not enough to destabilize
the Right Chancellor's position.

639
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,240
Yun Qing used Amita

640
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,711
to pry open a gap in Lingnan.

641
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,830
Now that the Right Chancellor is busy

642
00:32:02,066 --> 00:32:04,377
preparing for the Noble Consort's
birthday celebration,

643
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,240
he has no time for other matters.

644
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,160
This is the perfect opportunity for us
to continue gathering solid evidence.

645
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Indeed.

646
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,133
He Youguang dares not
let Right Chancellor know

647
00:32:14,155 --> 00:32:15,000
that Amita has turned.

648
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,550
He only sent his personal aides

649
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,111
to secretly hunt her down in Lingnan

650
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,440
and dispose of her.

651
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,750
Although Amita
does not have hard evidence,

652
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,680
she remains a key witness.

653
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,270
I have already sent someone
to protect her

654
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:28,720
and will look for an opportunity
to meet her soon.

655
00:32:29,044 --> 00:32:31,110
Right Chancellor and I
have kept each other in check

656
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,200
for a long time.

657
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,590
It is time to purge the treacherous

658
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,030
and restore order to the court.

659
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,310
There are far too many on the court

660
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,066
who follow the wind and cling to power.

661
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,400
Fortunately,
we have your integrity to hold the line.

662
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,310
Only then does the Great Tang
still have a sliver of hope.

663
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,640
Send a message to Yun Qing at once.

664
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:52,680
(Tell her)

665
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,200
(the time has come.)

666
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,750
(Make sure the plan is well laid
before taking action.)

667
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,510
(There is no room for mistakes.)

668
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,920
I'm leaving, Xiu'er.

669
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,760
Be good
and wait for your father to come back.

670
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,550
Thank you, Sir.

671
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,000
Good girl.

672
00:33:13,177 --> 00:33:14,066
Let's go inside.

673
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,200
Miss.

674
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,350
We're here to see Mr. Li.

675
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,880
Who are you?

676
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,200
When Mr. Li bought this mansion,

677
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,830
we did him

678
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,400
a little "good deed."

679
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,110
Good deed?

680
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:40,955
Others prefer to call it "capital."

681
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,880
You lent him money.

682
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,510
Money is a vulgar thing.

683
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,510
One must put it

684
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,830
in refined terms.

685
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,133
Keep it from reeking too much of copper.

686
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,640
Ignore them.

687
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,590
They're bad people.

688
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,070
Unfortunately,

689
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,590
Mr. Li is not in today.

690
00:33:59,155 --> 00:34:00,666
Please come back another time.

691
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,790
Miss.

692
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,350
We'd love to come back another day,

693
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,400
but if we keep putting it off,

694
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,440
how many more "tomorrows"

695
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,920
does Mr. Li even have?

696
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,590
He has taken on a prestigious assignment
from His Majesty.

697
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,550
The whole of Chang'an

698
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,440
knows about it.

699
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,880
While we sympathize,

700
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,590
we can't help but wonder.

701
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,760
Was our "good deed" perhaps

702
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,360
done too hastily?

703
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,320
Now that we've met

704
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,960
someone close to Mr. Li,

705
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,840
we don't want to miss the chance

706
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,670
to sit down and talk.

707
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:46,070
We ask that you come with us

708
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,550
to meet our master.

709
00:34:51,555 --> 00:34:52,555
Here's the thing.

710
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,190
I'm Mr. Li's friend.

711
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,960
I don't speak on his behalf.

712
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,400
Even if I go with you,

713
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,590
I can't solve your problem.

714
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,840
I understand

715
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
what you are saying.

716
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,133
When Mr. Li returns,
I will pass on your message.

717
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,360
But if you alert him and scare him off,

718
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,960
we may never get the chance

719
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,230
to see Mr. Li again.

720
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,550
Miss.

721
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,866
Mr. Li is already back in Chang'an,

722
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,480
and has moved back

723
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,960
into the very mansion

724
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,480
we helped him buy.

725
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,550
If you keep putting us off,

726
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,670
you are making us feel

727
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,760
like we're a bunch of gullible fools.

728
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,280
We're perfectly

729
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,320
reasonable people,

730
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,110
but even a rabbit bites

731
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,150
when pushed too hard.

732
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,710
Please

733
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,800
don't force us

734
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,920
to lose our composure.

735
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:54,840
We're all business people here.

736
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,550
Harmony brings wealth.

737
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,150
Fine. I'll go with you.

738
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,030
Well, what do you think?

739
00:36:07,038 --> 00:36:09,380
(Clerk of Hall of State Affairs)

740
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:15,800
You should take it
to the disbursement officer

741
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,670
who handles these matters.

742
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,000
I did.

743
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,400
I just came from there.

744
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,440
The Six Ministries exist

745
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,670
to carry out decisions.

746
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,760
However, actual decisions
and policy-making

747
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,800
still fall under the Secretariat.

748
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,920
This makes things complicated.

749
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:34,920
Why is that?

750
00:36:36,022 --> 00:36:37,840
I am His Majesty's
appointed Litchi Envoy.

751
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,222
Can I not submit my petition directly
to the Eastern Office?

752
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,110
Do you know

753
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:46,150
why there are five departments here?

754
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,070
Why?

755
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,000
There are too many affairs.

756
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,630
How could the ministers possibly
handle them all directly?

757
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,400
Every petition submitted
to the Secretariat

758
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,920
first has to go through

759
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,150
the Six Ministries.

760
00:37:05,822 --> 00:37:07,800
Minor matters are handled internally.

761
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,840
Major ones are passed along
with recommendations

762
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,266
to one of the five departments.

763
00:37:13,444 --> 00:37:14,600
Only then are they brought

764
00:37:14,644 --> 00:37:16,133
before the ministers for deliberation.

765
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,320
And so?

766
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,190
So,

767
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,480
you can't bring your petition

768
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,000
directly here.

769
00:37:23,288 --> 00:37:25,050
It must go
to the Ministry of Revenue first.

770
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:26,550
After they finish their review,

771
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,800
they will forward it to our department.

772
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,000
That is the proper flow of bureaucracy.

773
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,550
But that just leads

774
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,800
to an endless loop,

775
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,960
doesn't it?

776
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,070
The process is
the standard of all things.

777
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,320
Just like water flows from high to low.

778
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,880
Only then can it move smoothly
and naturally.

779
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,777
That is what we call procedure.

780
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,760
You must follow the procedure.

781
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,480
It's clean.

782
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,266
I just washed it.

783
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,150
The Ministry of Revenue is very rigid.

784
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,800
There is no way
to slip your petition in here.

785
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,400
However,

786
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,280
there is another path

787
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,400
you might try.

788
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,550
All the tribute goods from the provinces

789
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,510
are first delivered

790
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,866
to the Imperial Household Department
for storage.

791
00:38:40,377 --> 00:38:41,760
(Litchis fall under that category.)

792
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,320
(That's the department you need.)

793
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,070
(Go tomorrow.)

794
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,920
(At this hour,)

795
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,630
(they are just about)

796
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,150
(to get off duty.)

797
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,550
Take her out to play.

798
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,590
Follow me.

799
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,150
Go on.

800
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,150
Speak.

801
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,630
There must be an important reason

802
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,644
for your insistence
that we be brought here.

803
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,440
You seem like a straightforward person.

804
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,110
Then I will be frank.

805
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,880
Your lover, Mr. Li,

806
00:39:50,066 --> 00:39:52,230
borrowed 150 guan from me

807
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,150
to purchase that mansion
in Guiyi Ward.

808
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,800
But as soon as the loan went out,

809
00:39:57,066 --> 00:39:59,350
he took on a mission
that is essentially a death sentence.

810
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,590
By the first day of June,

811
00:40:01,844 --> 00:40:04,320
he will likely be separated
from us for good.

812
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:08,030
I lend money to make a profit,

813
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,480
not to do charity.

814
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:14,510
I brought you here today to say

815
00:40:15,066 --> 00:40:16,630
that now that he is back in Chang'an,

816
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:20,733
he should repay what he owes me.

817
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,440
Since it's a loan,

818
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:25,177
then there must be a contract.

819
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:30,110
If Mr. Li fails to repay on time,

820
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,190
then he is in breach.

821
00:40:32,022 --> 00:40:33,440
But if you do not collect the debt

822
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,960
according to the terms,

823
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,440
you are in breach.

824
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,800
If you do business
without following the rules,

825
00:40:45,955 --> 00:40:46,920
you will not last long

826
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,030
no matter where you go.

827
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:55,360
Playing by the rules is fine,

828
00:40:56,044 --> 00:40:57,880
but the rules

829
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:04,333
must be set by me.

830
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,760
I dare to lend money to Chang'an.

831
00:41:14,466 --> 00:41:15,880
You can be sure I have my way

832
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,800
to get it back.

833
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,480
Are you really ready to vow

834
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,400
to burn bridges with me?

835
00:41:38,022 --> 00:41:39,550
Until the first day of June,

836
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,320
Li Shande is His Majesty's appointed

837
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,030
Litchi Envoy.

838
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,320
Even if you break ties with him,

839
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,066
what can you actually do to him?

840
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,110
So, you are set

841
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,800
on not repaying the debt?

842
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:04,280
He did get the money in Lingnan.

843
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,030
And he invested all of it

844
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,222
into the litchi transport experiment.

845
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,030
He used that money in exchange

846
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,280
for a chance to survive.

847
00:42:16,822 --> 00:42:19,110
That is why he came back to Chang'an.

848
00:42:19,511 --> 00:42:21,070
Once he gets the official approval,

849
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:23,190
the litchi transport will be complete.

850
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,110
There's no need for you to worry.

851
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,200
Come the first day of June,

852
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,288
he will not die.

853
00:42:33,937 --> 00:42:36,720
=The Litchi Road=

854
00:42:36,911 --> 00:42:38,350
Why did you get into a fight again?

855
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,920
She teases me
about having a big head.

856
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,790
I can let that slide.

857
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,880
But this time she said

858
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,220
my father took on a death mission

859
00:42:43,222 --> 00:42:45,133
and won't live past
the first day of June!

860
00:42:45,133 --> 00:42:45,911
She asked for it!

861
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:46,710
Guiyun.

862
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:48,010
(Study Hall)

863
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,070
Xinmin.

864
00:42:50,177 --> 00:42:51,400
What are you doing here?

865
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,670
Did your father get another assignment?

866
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,920
He said he's going
to come out on top today.

867
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,230
Leave.

868
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:05,760
But...

869
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,800
At least tell me

870
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,880
where I'm supposed to go!

871
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,066
