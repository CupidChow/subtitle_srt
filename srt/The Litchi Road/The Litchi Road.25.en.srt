Whoever comes to view the documents,

10

you must report to me immediately.

11
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,270
Understood, Sir.

12
00:02:04,488 --> 00:02:06,355
You've passed the arithmetic exam

13
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:07,777
and just started your post.

14
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,710

All scrolls here

20
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,280

of the people's livelihood.

28
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,960
I will be cautious

29
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,133
and leave no stone unturned.

30
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,430

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,310

00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,155
this one lasts?

Three days.

37
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,430

This is the Vice Minister
of Bureau of Agriculture.

43
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,680
Please pardon me.

44
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,311
Greetings, Sir.

45
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,360
Who are you?

46
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,470
Where is

47
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,920
Recorder Meng?

48
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,533
I guess he hasn't arrived yet.

49
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,630
I'm Li Shande.

50
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,430
I joined yesterday.

51
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,870
While sorting scrolls last night,

52
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,333
I found some inconsistencies.

53
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,750
I spent the night recalculating

54
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,070
and fell asleep.

55
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,960
You just joined the office

56
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:21,155
and already found mistakes?

57
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,955
Please have a look, Sir.

58
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,288
This is the storage record
for this year.

59
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,190
This is the release record

60
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,377
from last winter.

61
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,920
And this is the measurement

62
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:39,488
of the large granary storage container.

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,840
I figure

64
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,870
the reported figures may be inaccurate

65
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,355
or there are some hidden figures.

66
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:51,910
The storage records are overseen
by both the minister

67
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:54,800
and the censorate
before being filed.

68
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:57,160
The release records are handled
by the recorder,

69
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,680
based on source

70
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,000
and type of grain,

71
00:05:00,111 --> 00:05:02,355
and cross-checked
with the wooden calibration wedges

72
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,240
of the issuer

73
00:05:04,688 --> 00:05:07,320
and the chief of each granary
before the grain release.

74
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:09,310
Multiple parties are involved
in the inspection.

75
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,490
How could there be a mistake?

76
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,110
I believe

77
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,955
grain is the foundation of the people

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,600
as well as our prime duty.

79
00:05:16,977 --> 00:05:18,600
If our records and inventories

80
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
aren't handled precisely,

81
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,310
even the slightest discrepancy

82
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,333
can result in great differences.

83
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,488
Both publicly and privately,

84
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,355
this is a grave mistake.

85
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,666
You may not be fully aware
of the entire picture.

86
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,040
You can't judge based on these...

87
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,000
Please read this, Sir.

88
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:36,630
Twelve large granary
storage containers with,

89
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,460
a top diameter of 3 meters,
bottom of 3 meters,

90
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,630
and height of 4 meters.

91
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,088
Thirteen small granary storage
containers. Top diameter 3 meters...

92
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,020
(Millet, sorghum, maize, wheat, rice)

93
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,160
After calculations,

94
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,333
the total should be 8,067 dan.

95
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,070
Therefore, the figure in the document

96
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,920
and the actual record

97
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,800
differ by 186 dan.

98
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:02,355
This is indeed an error.

99
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,733
May I take these scrolls and drafts back

100
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,600
for further examination?

101
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,760
Mr. Meng said

102
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:19,422
every review must be approved by him.

103
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,670
No worries.

104
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,311
Every single grain
and every inch of silk

105
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,160
is the people's

106
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,870
hard work.

107
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,950
I'll investigate thoroughly

108
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:32,511
and get to the bottom of it.

109
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,710
Yes, Sir.

110
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,480
Li Shande.

111
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:37,800
(Bureau of Agriculture)
This fellow can discover corruption

112
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,844
but can't resolve it.

113
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,430
So, I'm assigning him

114
00:06:41,888 --> 00:06:43,466
to you for some training.

115
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,160
You're far-sighted, Sir.

116
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,270
I'm impressed.

117
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,155
What a devious fox.

118
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,360
As expected,

119
00:07:13,511 --> 00:07:15,349
Li Shande got promoted
in just three days.

120
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,950
He's transferred to the Shanglin Office.

121
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,790
However,

122
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,870
Mr. Meng was found
tampering with the records

123
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:21,422
and was disgraced in his final years.

124
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:22,720
He was exiled

125
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,190
to a provincial granary.

126
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,200
That's all?

127
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,222
The record altered by Mr. Meng

128
00:07:31,355 --> 00:07:33,950
was actually reviewed
by the Vice Minister.

129
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,680
Li Shande

130
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:38,377
is such a fool.

131
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,800
He insisted on exposing this

132
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,511
and ended up offending
the Vice Minister.

133
00:07:44,622 --> 00:07:47,111
My brother
at the Ministry of Personnel told me

134
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,555
that he'd only been there for three days

135
00:07:49,777 --> 00:07:51,377
and already got Mr. Meng expelled

136
00:07:51,377 --> 00:07:52,622
from the Bureau of Agriculture.

137
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,470
What?

138
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,270
Chief Liu

139
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,480
offended him last time

140
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,266
and mocked him with carp.

141
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,830
If Li Shande

142
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,040
reports him

143
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,688
for eating peaches
from the imperial garden

144
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,800
without permission,

145
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,070
wouldn't he end up

146
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,800
like Mr. Meng,

147
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:16,466
exiled to some remote province?

148
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,830
Chief Liu.

149
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,710
Chief Liu.

150
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,670
Chief Liu.

151
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,920
Liangyuan,

152
00:08:36,022 --> 00:08:38,000
there's something
I need to discuss with you.

153
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,790
I believe you're a man of talent.

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,550
I wish you could prove yourself.

155
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,120
Since you have some knowledge

156
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,720
about flowers, birds, fish, and insects,

157
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:51,270
why don't you take up duty
at Leyou Garden?

158
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,480
Sir,

159
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm from the arithmetic division.

160
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,360
Sir, flowers...

161
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,920
Supervisor Li.

162
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,500
=Episode 25=

163
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,360
This pink silk-embroidered circular fan

164
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,630
clearly belongs to a lady.

165
00:09:44,022 --> 00:09:45,733
Could it be there's a woman here

166
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,790
who has caught your eye, Guiyun?

167
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,320
This is my fan.

168
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,630
You must be kidding.

169
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,480
Look.

170
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,630
There's a hidden design.

171
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,666
It makes me look fairer.

172
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,870
The two characters here say "Longing".

173
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,977
How do you explain this?

174
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,180
(Longing)

175
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,030
To others, it means longing for lovers.

176
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,240
But to me,

177
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:16,733
(Longing for Chancellor)
it's read differently.

178
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,510
Longing for Chancellor?

179
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,360
No news heard from the one I care for
who is far away.

180
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,670
Though we are far apart,
we share the same moon.

181
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,030
I may be in Lingnan,

182
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:34,244
but I think of the Right Chancellor
every day.

183
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:36,311
Every time I drink alone
under the moonlight

184
00:10:36,444 --> 00:10:38,066
and look north where Chang'an stands,

185
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,790
thoughts well up in my heart.

186
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,600
I can't hold back my tears.

187
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,630
Hence, I wrote this

188
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,670
to ease my pain of longing.

189
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,600
The Right Chancellor

190
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,870
will surely be moved by your sincerity.

191
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,800
I hope so.

192
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,550
Perhaps this bookstore

193
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,840
holds only the books you need,

194
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,030
but never the ones I need.

195
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,600
If that is so, I take my leave.

196
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,720
Take care, Xinmin.

197
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,680
Farewell.

198
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:32,160
Attendant Yu,

199
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,080
it's dark.

200
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,040
Watch your footing.

201
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,844
Save your flattery.

202
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,155
Serving Noble Consort is what matters.

203
00:11:40,822 --> 00:11:42,270
Right Chancellor warns

204
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,150
that this birthday banquet

205
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,733
must be done properly.

206
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,910
There's not much time left.

207
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,910
How are the tributes from every region
coming along?

208
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,870
All birthday tributes

209
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,750
are on the way.

210
00:11:54,111 --> 00:11:56,088
Gifts from foreign states
have crossed the borders

211
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,266
and should arrive in Chang'an
by next month.

212
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,160
When they arrive,

213
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,244
assign more men to
the Imperial Household Department

214
00:12:02,244 --> 00:12:03,822
and Left Storage Office to keep watch.

215
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,577
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

216
00:12:06,044 --> 00:12:07,480
Aside from the birthday tributes,

217
00:12:07,822 --> 00:12:09,466
the local specialties from each region

218
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,733
must also arrive on time.

219
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,488
You need to keep a close watch
from time to time.

220
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,590
Yes, Sir.

221
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,510
Attendant Yu,

222
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
speaking of which,

223
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:19,888
there's been quite some news lately.

224
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,822
That Litchi Envoy
has returned from Lingnan.

225
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,320
Litchi Envoy?

226
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,750
Have you forgotten?

227
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,622
You saw him at the Leyou Garden.

228
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,244
When he was first appointed,

229
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,110
he panicked,

230
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,000
saying that transporting litchis

231
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,866
from Lingnan to Chang'an was impossible.

232
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,960
You told him
he might as well wait to die.

233
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,750
That fool

234
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,270
now claims he's found a way

235
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,866
to transport fresh litchis.

236
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,320
He's been to every office

237
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,266
to submit his petition,

238
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,120
but he was shut out and kicked around

239
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,150
like a ball.

240
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,600
He even dared to go

241
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,155
to the Ministry of War.

242
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,630
He got thrown out

243
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,400
and nearly scared to death.

244
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,000
Desperately fighting
even when he's cornered

245
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,630
for a chance.

246
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,270
This Litchi Envoy

247
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,555
reminds me of my past.

248
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,110
Attendant Yu,

249
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,377
it was an amazing act
that you transported wax

250
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,390
by horses.

251
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:16,777
No one can replicate that.

252
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,790
How could that Litchi Envoy

253
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,390
compare to you?

254
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:24,044
Great rewards lie in great risk.

255
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,390
Opportunities often come

256
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,844
from great danger.

257
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,333
If that Litchi Envoy

258
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,120
has found a method

259
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,000
to transport fresh litchis,

260
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,480
that means

261
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,910
he's holding a chance

262
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,390
that could lead to boundless fortune.

263
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,710
Speak up.

264
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,400
How did the peony get infested?

265
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:52,933
How many days has it been?

266
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,560
Two days.

267
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,560
Two days?

268
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:58,960
And you didn't say a word.

269
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,866
Why didn't you tell me?

270
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,150
What's wrong with you?

271
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,711
You haven't come by for two days.

272
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,390
We couldn't possibly

273
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,870
go to the Shanglin Office on our own.

274
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,040
This is bad.

275
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:15,466
The Right Chancellor is coming

276
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,550
this afternoon.

277
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,000
If he sees this,

278
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,022
we'll all be punished.

279
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,920
Catch the bugs.

280
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,670
Get everyone to catch the bugs.

281
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,360
But

282
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,044
we can't catch them all.

283
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,270
It needs pesticides.

284
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,977
You think I need you to tell me that?

285
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,866
If you can't come up
with a proper formula

286
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,200
and end up killing the peony,

287
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,480
we'll all lose our heads.

288
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,550
That's His Majesty's favorite peony.

289
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,755
How could you be so careless?

290
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,200
You can't blame me for that.

291
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,400
After Li Shande left,

292
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,044
we agreed

293
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,177
we'd all take care
of the peony together.

294
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,320
Well,

295
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,790
it's the leaves that got infested.

296
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,480
How is that on me?

297
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,755
How could you say that?

298
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,480
I'm in charge of pruning the branches,

299
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,870
and I trim only dry ones

300
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,270
with extreme care.

301
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:26,000
I've done it more carefully
than I cut my mother's nails.

302
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,720
The bugs must've come

303
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,270
from the soil.

304
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,870
I loosen the soil

305
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,720
and fertilize it,

306
00:15:36,911 --> 00:15:37,839
but I use only

307
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,150
the finest rake

308
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,000
and fertilizer.

309
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,080
If it's

310
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,440
the soil and the fertilizer,

311
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,360
shouldn't we ask

312
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,400
the procurement clerk and treasurer?

313
00:15:48,977 --> 00:15:50,150
If I had bought fertilizer

314
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,440
with insect eggs in it,

315
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,550
why did the bugs

316
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,440
only appear now?

317
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,240
I think

318
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,044
someone must've slacked off.

319
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,670
It must be the fault

320
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,511
of the protective mesh.

321
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,200
It allowed the bugs in.

322
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,200
Yes, I'm in charge
of the protective mesh.

323
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,390
But my brother,

324
00:16:11,422 --> 00:16:13,222
who is director
of the Ministry of Personnel,

325
00:16:13,288 --> 00:16:14,630
always teaches me

326
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:18,266
that you can never tell with people.

327
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,590
Sir,

328
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:21,870
was the protection mesh

329
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,444
meant to block bugs?

330
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
This is indeed

331
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,509
a wrong accusation.

332
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:31,270
Please judge fairly, Sir.

333
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,510
In that case,

334
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,822
none of you is to blame.

335
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:45,066
I'm in charge of all the gardens
under the Shanglin Office.

336
00:16:45,355 --> 00:16:47,200
If I have to inspect everything myself,

337
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,870
a peony today,

338
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,720
a bamboo tomorrow,

339
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,000
or every single trivial task,

340
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,088
what do I need you all for?

341
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,800
This matter

342
00:16:57,222 --> 00:16:58,688
must be made clear today.

343
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,244
Someone has to take the responsibility.

344
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,600
I heard Li Shande is back.

345
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,110
Really?

346
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,280
Yes.

347
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,720
It's said

348
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,070
that he caused quite a scene

349
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,720
at every office

350
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,111
with his litchi petition.

351
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,920
He didn't get the permit

352
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,240
and got shut out.

353
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,840
Sir,

354
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,200
in fact,

355
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,888
Li Shande was the one taking care
of this peony in the first place.

356
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,640
We're only helping out

357
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,310
as colleagues.

358
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,870
Exactly.

359
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,590
Who knows if the peony got infested

360
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,310
because he patched the broken branch

361
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,200
with yellow mud?

362
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,960
The peony was wounded,

363
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,030
and the dirty mud

364
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,790
got into its core

365
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,070
while it was weak.

366
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,400
Of course,

367
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,110
it'd get infested over time.

368
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,280
In that case,

369
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,222
Li Shande should take the blame.

370
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,520
Him?

371
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,440
He'll soon face his demise.

372
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,790
He has nothing left to lose.

373
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,444
Why would he take the blame?

374
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:17,844
We could trick him into
coming back to Leyou Garden.

375
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,755
Who else could still fool him now?

376
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,350
If not,

377
00:18:24,444 --> 00:18:26,466
we'll try something else.

378
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,444
Sir, please help me.

379
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,350
I have an eighty-year-old mother,

380
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,866
(Shanglin Office)
sir!

381
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,955
Even though Li Shande
is now the Litchi Envoy,

382
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,790
he was once our colleague.

383
00:18:51,711 --> 00:18:53,149
Now he's returned to Chang'an

384
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,880
and is being turned away
by every office...

385
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,840
Why don't we

386
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,430
invite him over

387
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,200
for a catch-up?

388
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,310
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

389
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:12,670
Supervisor Li,

390
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,444
Secretary Han is out on official duty.

391
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,355
He'll be back by the Shen hour.

392
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,480
Please wait here.

393
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,060
(Ministry of Justice)

394
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,110
Liangyuan?

395
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,933
When did you return to Chang'an?

396
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,644
Is your mission as the Litchi Envoy

397
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,244
going smoothly?

398
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,240
Oh right.

399
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,000
Liangyuan.

400
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,840
Hey, Liangyuan.

401
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
I understand how you feel.

402
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,720
To be honest,

403
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,070
if I were given this duty,

404
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,070
I'd be resentful too.

405
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,244
But you've misunderstood us.

406
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,430
Yes,

407
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,950
now

408
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,110
the Litchi Envoy

409
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,600
is a laughingstock among the offices.

410
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,000
They may laugh,

411
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,350
but we at the Shanglin Office can't.

412
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,280
After you left,

413
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:36,960
Chief Liu blamed himself often.

414
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,550
He said he was useless

415
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:39,955
and couldn't help you.

416
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,070
But you know

417
00:20:42,288 --> 00:20:43,977
what the Shanglin Office really is.

418
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,790
We have

419
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,160
no real power.

420
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,680
Other offices

421
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,920
can push responsibilities away,

422
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,488
but we have to take it on,

423
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,400
even if we don't like it.

424
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,400
Liangyuan, after you left,

425
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,510
we all missed you.

426
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,270
We all hoped

427
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,400
you'd succeed

428
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,200
and bring honor to the Shanglin Office.

429
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,680
If you're facing any problems,

430
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,790
you must speak up.

431
00:21:22,688 --> 00:21:24,466
What you're going through now

432
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,933
could well be our future.

433
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:31,270
We'll definitely support you.

434
00:21:47,955 --> 00:21:49,777
I'm fine. You go on.

435
00:21:56,444 --> 00:21:57,520
Supervisor Song.

436
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,080
Do you...

437
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,920
Do you know anyone

438
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,240
who can help me

439
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,644
get this litchi delivery petition
submitted?

440
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,510
This is ridiculous!

441
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,070
Li Shande has already found

442
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,480
a method to transport litchis.

443
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,350
However, these offices

444
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:21,577
still won't accept it
and stall the progress.

445
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,440
It was also them

446
00:22:27,844 --> 00:22:30,030
who pushed
the litchi envoy mission around,

447
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,790
that's how

448
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,288
it landed on us.

449
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,822
These shameless rascals.

450
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,400
I know them too well.

451
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,480
Liangyuan,

452
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,590
what's your plan?

453
00:22:51,844 --> 00:22:54,377
The litchi delivery can't proceed

454
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,177
without official approval.

455
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,150
So I came

456
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,110
to ask

457
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,270
if you know anyone

458
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,911
who can help submit this petition.

459
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,310
If we submit it

460
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,711
through the Shanglin Office,

461
00:23:13,244 --> 00:23:15,177
it's likely to get us the cold shoulder.

462
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:20,950
Mr. Qu,

463
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:23,866
doesn't your brother serve
at the Ministry of Personnel?

464
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:25,555
Could he help?

465
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,320
Sir,

466
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,920
my brother is a director,

467
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:32,377
and submitting a petition

468
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:33,600
would be easy for him,

469
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,000
but unfortunately,

470
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:36,880
he just left for Luoyang

471
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,160
on duty earlier today.

472
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,600
He won't be back until next month.

473
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,800
Liangyuan,

474
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,555
can you wait?

475
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
I can't.

476
00:23:48,765 --> 00:23:50,285
If you'd come to me yesterday,

477
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,150
it might've worked.

478
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,320
Oh right.

479
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,000
I have a relative
at the Imperial Library.

480
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:58,910
He

481
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,720
handles logistics.

482
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,777
I can ask him.

483
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,110
The Imperial Library

484
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,550
deals with books.

485
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,350
Actually,

486
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,933
I have a connection.

487
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,880
It's my classmate.

488
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:21,800
He just got promoted to recorder
at the Imperial Household Department.

489
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,960
I can pay him a visit

490
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,440
and see if

491
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,533
he can do me this favor.

492
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,590
I've tried that.

493
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,550
They handle tributes
from foreign states.

494
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,888
What I'm working on
is litchis from Lingnan.

495
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The Shanglin Office

496
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,440
has no real power.

497
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,550
To put it plainly,

498
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,311
we grow flowers and trees.

499
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,640
We've seen a lot of

500
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,240
influential officials

501
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,155
at Leyou Gaden,

502
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,160
but we never

503
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,790
knew them.

504
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,640
We can't even get close,

505
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,640
let alone make a connection.

506
00:25:07,244 --> 00:25:08,555
Now that you mention it,

507
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,350
it reminds me of someone

508
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,000
among us

509
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,488
who's made a connection.

510
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,390
Who?

511
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,444
You.

512
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,190
Don't you remember?

513
00:25:22,977 --> 00:25:24,511
The Right Chancellor asked

514
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,960
to build a canopy

515
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,440
for His Majesty's favorite peony,

516
00:25:27,955 --> 00:25:29,440
but the branches got damaged.

517
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,070
You were the one who saved it

518
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,110
and the Right Chancellor.

519
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,533
That was a huge service.

520
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,440
Now that the peony is thriving,

521
00:25:38,866 --> 00:25:40,990
the Right Chancellor is pleased
every time he sees it,

522
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,550
and he even mentioned you.

523
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,110
He surely remembers
what you did for him.

524
00:25:53,711 --> 00:25:56,000
How could I ever get to see
the Right Chancellor?

525
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,910
If I recall,

526
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,666
your appointment as the Litchi Envoy

527
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,311
was signed by him.

528
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,310
If you report it to him,

529
00:26:06,355 --> 00:26:07,800
it's not considered overstepping.

530
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,720
Besides, the delivery

531
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,750
has proven doable.

532
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,880
He'll likely be pleased

533
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,711
and not blame you.

534
00:26:16,844 --> 00:26:18,555
After the Beginning of Spring,

535
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,680
Right Chancellor always comes

536
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,270
to visit the Leyou Garden.

537
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,160
Each time, he asks the person on duty

538
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,880
to report about that peony.

539
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,920
That may be your chance.

540
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,550
When's his next visit?

541
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,333
As usual, it's today.

542
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,520
Liangyuan.

543
00:26:49,622 --> 00:26:50,720
Take this and give it a try.

544
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,377
Don't be late.

545
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,350
Go on.

546
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:24,430
Yes, Sir.

547
00:28:19,955 --> 00:28:21,080
What happened?

548
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,160
Mr. Li, you're back.

549
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,720
The peony is infested with bugs.

550
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,910
It's infested?

551
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:26,840
Mr. Li,

552
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,160
please help us.

553
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:28,960
Mr. Li,

554
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,830
please help us.

555
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,422
Please help us.

556
00:28:30,444 --> 00:28:30,880
Get up.

557
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,560
What's going on?

558
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,680
Didn't Mr. Song tell you?

559
00:28:34,022 --> 00:28:35,400
It was his shift today,

560
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,350
but when he saw

561
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,240
the infested peony,

562
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:39,844
he feared Right Chancellor
might blame him, so he ran off scared.

563
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,270
Who would've thought

564
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,733
he'd push you to take the blame?

565
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,830
These scoundrels.

566
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,390
I thought

567
00:28:52,177 --> 00:28:53,160
even the cruelest person

568
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,400
should have a conscience.

569
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:58,000
I didn't expect them to be this vile.

570
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,720
Mr. Li, please help us.

571
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,000
Well,

572
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:04,960
is the Right Chancellor coming today?

573
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,350
He'll be here after noon,

574
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,390
as usual.

575
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,470
If he sees this,

576
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,880
we're done for.

577
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,440
Mr. Li, help us.

578
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:11,880
Get up.

579
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,750
Hurry and get up.

580
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,510
Please help us.

581
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,350
Get up. Quick.

582
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,240
Let me have a look.

583
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,000
Get up.

584
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,070
Come on.

585
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,200
Why are we here

586
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,422
at Leyou Garden today?

587
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,630
Have you heard?

588
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,920
His Majesty casually mentioned

589
00:29:25,422 --> 00:29:26,911
the flowers were about to bloom.

590
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,070
He must be thinking

591
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,844
of visiting.

592
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,310
The Right Chancellor
frequents the garden

593
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:36,888
because he's watching it
for His Majesty.

594
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,630
Now

595
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,110
is the perfect time.

596
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,466
If he reports this to His Majesty,

597
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,160
it will surely please him.

598
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,920
Why don't we just

599
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,444
tell the Right Chancellor directly?

600
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,000
He's feeling unwell today.

601
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,880
Since we wish

602
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,160
to earn his favor,

603
00:29:58,733 --> 00:30:01,155
we'll have to be thoughtful.

604
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,350
We'll keep watch

605
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,680
and check for any issues.

606
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
Then report it

607
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,270
to him.

608
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,400
Wouldn't that please him even more?

609
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,000
That way...

610
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,760
That way,

611
00:30:17,977 --> 00:30:19,800
we gain the Right Chancellor's favor,

612
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,880
and he gains His Majesty's favor.

613
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:23,577
If His Majesty is pleased,

614
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,550
we're all happy.

615
00:30:25,311 --> 00:30:26,955
Attendant Yu, your thoughtfulness

616
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,377
is unmatched in the palace.

617
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,440
The Right Chancellor is unwell,

618
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,822
and everyone's trying to impress him.

619
00:30:35,977 --> 00:30:37,577
The Imperial Academy of Medicine alone

620
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,022
has sent seven or eight
senior physicians.

621
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,550
Not to mention those

622
00:30:42,022 --> 00:30:43,160
attentively waiting on him

623
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,310
and bringing tonics.

624
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,355
They've worn a path at his door.

625
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,720
However,

626
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,240
only a few

627
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,750
truly understand

628
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,110
his needs.

629
00:31:01,288 --> 00:31:02,888
Thank you for your guidance, Sir.

630
00:31:02,933 --> 00:31:04,244
That was very educational.

631
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,110
What's wrong, Sir?

632
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,550
What's that smell?

633
00:31:22,711 --> 00:31:24,666
It smells like something's burning.

634
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,680
Who set a fire here?

635
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,040
Attendant Yu,

636
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,777
it's not a fire.
We're smoking the bugs out.

637
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:34,870
Bugs?

638
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,333
The peony is infested with bugs.

639
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,030
The peony is infested?

640
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,680
How have you all been tending them?

641
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,880
What's that smell?

642
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,760
Sulfur.

643
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,066
The infestation is severe.

644
00:31:54,244 --> 00:31:55,555
Oh, the infestation is severe.

645
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,830
We must cover the soil with ash

646
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,110
to kill the larvae,

647
00:31:59,377 --> 00:32:01,288
then burn sulfur and mugwort repeatedly

648
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,960
to eliminate the rest.

649
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,590
Leyou Garden is an imperial garden.

650
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,311
You've turned it into a smoky mess.

651
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,270
Fortunately, the Right Chancellor
isn't coming

652
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,844
due to his sick condition. If he were

653
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,733
to breathe this smoke,
you'd lose your head!

654
00:32:16,555 --> 00:32:18,244
The Right Chancellor isn't coming?

655
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,350
Attendant Yu,

656
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,550
he's that Litchi Envoy.

657
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,866
I think I've seen you somewhere.

658
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,920
I'm Li Shande from the Shanglin Office.

659
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,977
Greetings, Attendant Yu.

660
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,920
I once asked you

661
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,244
about how to transport fresh litchis.

662
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,270
A death

663
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,030
can put paid to this mission.

664
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,160
People

665
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,270
would understand.

666
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,955
You didn't die.

667
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,550
Any progress

668
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,910
on your mission?

669
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,377
The transport isn't a problem now,

670
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,830
but no office

671
00:33:05,888 --> 00:33:07,311
will accept my petition.

672
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,160
Perhaps you were right.

673
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,640
Only if I die

674
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,622
can the mission end.

675
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,266
Judging by what you said,

676
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,830
the fresh litchis

677
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,680
won't reach His Majesty after all.

678
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,520
No.

679
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,622
The litchi delivery is feasible,

680
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,920
but it has to go through

681
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,070
every office

682
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,311
for approval.

683
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,640
You may not know.

684
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:36,910
That process

685
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,688
takes at least a month.

686
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,630
That won't do.

687
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,688
Noble Consort's birthday
is on the first day of June.

688
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,050
We can't wait a month.

689
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,790
Do you know why

690
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,270
His Majesty appointed a special envoy

691
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,755
who's above all offices?

692
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,960
He wanted it done

693
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:58,880
as soon

694
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,733
as he ordered.

695
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,310
And yet

696
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,066
you're still stuck.

697
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,440
No one actually

698
00:34:13,755 --> 00:34:15,777
follows the imperial decree.

699
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,280
Well.

700
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,710
As the vice purchasing commissioner,

701
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:27,533
my duty is to procure goods
for the inner court.

702
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,630
If fresh litchis from Gaozhou

703
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,070
is what His Majesty desires,

704
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,630
I'll help you

705
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,777
bypass those complex procedures.

706
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,880
You're really helping me?

707
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:44,070
If I could share His Majesty's burden,

708
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:48,377
I'll see it through to the end.

709
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,030
But I heard

710
00:34:54,755 --> 00:34:57,022
litchis lose their color,
fragrance, and flavor

711
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,800
after three days.

712
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,350
Are you sure

713
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,630
they can be delivered fresh?

714
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,630
Have a look at this.

715
00:35:10,866 --> 00:35:13,044
Here's the litchi delivery method
I came up with.

716
00:35:15,777 --> 00:35:17,266
All the details are stated here.

717
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,230
This is indeed brilliant.

718
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,510
But

719
00:35:34,622 --> 00:35:36,555
I must return to the palace at once.

720
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,480
May I take this back
and study it carefully?

721
00:35:39,755 --> 00:35:41,133
If I don't understand something,

722
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,977
I'll come to see you tomorrow.

723
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,000
What time?

724
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,840
Tomorrow,

725
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,622
10 o'clock in the morning.

726
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,030
We'll meet here.

727
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:51,160
Yes, Sir.

728
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,000
Attendant Yu?

729
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,120
Liangyuan,

730
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,550
why didn't you consult me first?

731
00:36:00,266 --> 00:36:02,577
None of the offices
accepted my petition.

732
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,311
He was the only one willing to help me.

733
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,070
Attendant Yu is a newly promoted eunuch

734
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,710
in the inner court.

735
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,440
He's cunning

736
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,800
and always steals credit.

737
00:36:14,977 --> 00:36:17,155
Everyone calls him
"Softshell Turtle On Top".

738
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,390
What does that mean?

739
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,480
It means he's like a softshell turtle,

740
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,670
once he bites,

741
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,710
he won't let go.

742
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,333
Then why is it "on top"?

743
00:36:27,111 --> 00:36:28,600
He's an eunuch, that's why.

744
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:32,800
You should've been extra careful

745
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,150
dealing with him.

746
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,239
Woe to you.

747
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,070
Now that he's taken
your litchi delivery method,

748
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,400
he could just use it as his own

749
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,644
and head to Lingnan
to transport fresh litchis back.

750
00:36:41,644 --> 00:36:42,230
That way,

751
00:36:42,288 --> 00:36:44,355
all the credit will go to him.

752
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,320
You'll be cut out of everything.

753
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,600
No way.

754
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,030
He said

755
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,190
he wanted to take the petition back
and study it.

756
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,510
We agreed to meet again tomorrow

757
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,510
at Leyou Garden.

758
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,880
You believed him?

759
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,888
He won't come tomorrow.

760
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,110
It can't be.

761
00:37:04,911 --> 00:37:06,480
I've been to every office.

762
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,670
They can testify

763
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,920
the litchi delivery method

764
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,190
was my work.

765
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,320
Liangyuan,

766
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,066
when it comes to arithmetic,

767
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,933
you're an expert.

768
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,670
But in official dealings,

769
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,200
you're worse than a child.

770
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,550
Those offices

771
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,070
wouldn't accept your petition.

772
00:37:30,222 --> 00:37:31,440
Why would they testify for you?

773
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,644
They'd rather stay out of trouble.

774
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:35,244
Also, no one wants to offend

775
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,400
that "Softshell Turtle On Top"
over a thankless task.

776
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,070
How have you

777
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,070
not learned your lesson

778
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,480
after being schemed against

779
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,422
since you returned from Lingnan?

780
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,190
I spent

781
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,510
all my effort

782
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,070
on the litchi delivery method.

783
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,360
I didn't have the energy

784
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,755
to bother with all that politics.

785
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,933
If you'd attached an appreciation note

786
00:38:01,955 --> 00:38:03,440
when you handed in your method,

787
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,030
mentioning

788
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,509
the efforts of the Lingnan commissioner

789
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,410
and support from
the Bureau of General Accounts,

790
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,888
the Court of the Imperial Treasury,
the Bureau of Agriculture,

791
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,044
and the Imperial Kitchen,

792
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,422
then Attendant Yu wouldn't
dare to steal your credit.

793
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,630
Liangyuan, official dealings

794
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,288
boil down to three things.

795
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,880
Blend into the crowd, share the credit,

796
00:38:23,066 --> 00:38:25,800
and make even the lightest work
seem like a collective effort.

797
00:38:25,888 --> 00:38:27,510
If you take all the credit for yourself,

798
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,600
you won't last long.

799
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,088
I've spent months climbing,

800
00:38:37,022 --> 00:38:39,177
and just when I was about to
reach the top,

801
00:38:39,244 --> 00:38:40,511
I slipped

802
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,600
and fell into a pit again.

803
00:38:42,622 --> 00:38:43,622
Exactly.

804
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:46,880
Too bad

805
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,244
I'm just a low-ranking clerk,

806
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,133
and I'm too straightforward.

807
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,670
I only associate

808
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,155
with you and Zimei.

809
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,440
Now

810
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,466
I can see what's going on,

811
00:38:56,622 --> 00:38:58,977
but I have no way to help you out of it

812
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,711
or resolve your problem.

813
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,350
Maybe

814
00:39:07,911 --> 00:39:10,133
you should make arrangements
for your daughter.

815
00:39:10,711 --> 00:39:12,320
Find someone you trust to adopt her.

816
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,550
Adopt?

817
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,360
What are you on about?

818
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,320
Who can I give her to?

819
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,711
You?

820
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,590
I'm not giving her to anyone.

821
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,320
No way.

822
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:24,822
That softshell turtle
wouldn't do that to me.

823
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,680
Dig in.

824
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,120
Attendant Yu,

825
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,230
you promised to meet the Litchi Envoy

826
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,190
at 10 AM today

827
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,400
at Leyou Garden.

828
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,777
It's already past the hour.

829
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,244
I never intended to go.

830
00:39:52,866 --> 00:39:54,466
Are you planning to take charge

831
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,466
of the litchi delivery yourself?

832
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,880
He's indeed talented

833
00:40:04,422 --> 00:40:06,244
to come up with such a method.

834
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,070
It's

835
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,288
very complicated.

836
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,670
It takes meticulous calculations

837
00:40:14,177 --> 00:40:16,044
to avoid any mistakes.

838
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,510
I can tell

839
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,440
it's been tested and refined

840
00:40:23,511 --> 00:40:25,400
through multiple attempts in Lingnan.

841
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,190
This task

842
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:35,155
has to be him.

843
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,911
Please enlighten me.

844
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,311
Why haven't you gone to meet him yet?

845
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,840
The more urgent the matter,

846
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,022
the more patient we must be.

847
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,120
Mr. Li,

848
00:41:06,288 --> 00:41:07,755
what are you doing here?

849
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,639
I'm waiting for someone.

850
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,840
The garden is closed this afternoon
for pesticide spraying.

851
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:12,670
No one's coming.

852
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,760
Right.

853
00:41:22,066 --> 00:41:24,000
(Like a fish in the pond.)

854
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,440
(Starve it for a few days)

855
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,000
(to make it anxious)

856
00:41:30,422 --> 00:41:31,510
(and desperate.)

857
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,480
When it's dying,

858
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,400
feed it a little,

859
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,800
and it'll be so grateful

860
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,488
and see you as its savior.

861
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,880
We'll starve

862
00:41:48,377 --> 00:41:50,244
the Litchi Envoy for a few days.

863
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,880
Don't worry. He won't die.

864
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:59,288
Anyway, the petition is with me.

865
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,230
This fish

866
00:42:03,911 --> 00:42:05,230
is mine.

867
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,530
=The Litchi Road=

868
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,390
Just say it.

869
00:42:43,711 --> 00:42:45,111
What do you want me to do?

870
00:42:45,155 --> 00:42:47,733
Did you keep the evidence
I told you to gather?

871
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,760
Don't worry.

872
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:49,910
It's in safe hands.

873
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,440
Was it me who wanted litchis?

874
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:00,630
Was it?

875
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,110
It was His Majesty.

876
00:43:03,155 --> 00:43:04,088
It was Right Chancellor.

877
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:05,533
It was Right Chancellor's sister.

878
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:06,670
It was your sister.

879
00:43:06,866 --> 00:43:07,840
Fine, I give up.
