=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,940
(Medicine)

3
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,900
(Five Years Ago, Southern Stables)

4
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,220
(Feng)

5
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,520
Why are you here?

6
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,750
I came all this way.

7
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,400
It's been three years.

8
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,430
Nothing has changed.

9
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,777
I heard you were seriously ill.

10
00:02:27,844 --> 00:02:29,022
I came to check on you.

11
00:02:32,955 --> 00:02:34,911
No need to be so polite, Young Master.

12
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,240
Sounds like business
in Gaozhou is picking up.

13
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,590
Picking up? Certainly.

14
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,910
It's booming.

15
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,844
I am so busy
I barely have time to breathe.

16
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,910
Besides,

17
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,022
I checked out two shops
in the foreign market.

18
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,733
I want to take them over.

19
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:53,430
Where is Dark Cloud?

20
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,960
Where is Snowstep?

21
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,960
And Lightning?

22
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,150
Two years ago, you swore

23
00:03:01,377 --> 00:03:02,590
that if you ever came back,

24
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,355
you'd have money to bring the horses.

25
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,240
So tell me,

26
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:07,590
where are the horses?

27
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,960
The horses?

28
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,800
So why bother coming back?

29
00:03:18,488 --> 00:03:20,030
I came to see how you're doing.

30
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,590
To see me?

31
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:24,310
With these worthless things?

32
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,470
I came to check on you!

33
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,310
Get lost!

34
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,430
I...

35
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,520
I'll put

36
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,120
the stables up for sale tomorrow.

37
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,030
Look at what you're wearing.

38
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,120
Like a beggar from the North Gate.

39
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,150
Actually, worse.

40
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,030
This stable

41
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,933
belongs to me.

42
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,470
You're just a servant
watching over my horses.

43
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,560
Soon, I'll sell you off too!

44
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,190
Shameless fool!

45
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,222
(When I was young, I followed my father
to Chang'an to offer tribute chickens.)

46
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:43,750
(I became a disciple of Jia Chang,
the Chicken Whisperer.)

47
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,600
(I learned how to mimic bird calls
and how to train chickens.)

48
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,430
(But I came from a wealthy family.)

49
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,480
(So all I did was race horses
and fight cocks.)

50
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,270
(Good times didn't last.)

51
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,555
(Before he died, my father left behind
a mountain of debt.)

52
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,680
(I sold off our house and shops.)

53
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,000
(Only the Southern Stables were left.)

54
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,830
(And now I've lost even that.)

55
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,560
(I've truly lost everything.)

56
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,830
Look at me.

57
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,070
I don't even have a horse left.

58
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,830
It's my fault!

59
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,070
I was too stubborn.

60
00:05:34,844 --> 00:05:36,160
I walked right into their trap.

61
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,270
I made you lose the race.

62
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,920
It was me who lost.

63
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,488
My riding wasn't good enough.

64
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,270
You...

65
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,888
You're Feng, the swift rider.

66
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,510
In all of Gaozhou,

67
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,070
who else

68
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,830
can even measure up to you?

69
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,190
If I had the chance,

70
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,120
I'd love to race again.

71
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,120
Is there anything you still wish for?

72
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,950
Before I die,

73
00:06:22,888 --> 00:06:25,040
I wish I could meet someone
who takes my breath away.

74
00:06:26,822 --> 00:06:28,244
How wonderful that would be.

75
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,870
Like a fine horse

76
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,040
running toward you from afar.

77
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,750
Or maybe like

78
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,950
a moment,

79
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
a bird you've never seen before

80
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,480
flies right past your eyes.

81
00:06:56,244 --> 00:06:57,400
And your heart skips a beat.

82
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,940
=Episode 14=

83
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,110
Inspector He.

84
00:07:12,577 --> 00:07:13,790
Should this pardon order

85
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,870
be issued or not?

86
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,200
What do you think?

87
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,720
Amita

88
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,800
wants to handle this trade herself.

89
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,830
But what if that soldier

90
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,000
says something?

91
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,150
Or worse,

92
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,711
pulls out the dagger?

93
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,920
Then, the injury on your backside

94
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,488
won't be a secret to Amita.

95
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,160
How long has Amita

96
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,480
followed me?

97
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,110
About ten years.

98
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,510
She was just a little girl back then.

99
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,510
And now, just like that,
she's all grown up.

100
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,160
Chief Scribe Zhao,

101
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,270
don't these crabs on the table

102
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,830
look incredibly lifelike?

103
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,720
Your tastes are refined.

104
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,560
You can't even tell

105
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,630
it's just an empty shell.

106
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,510
But if this crab had a heart,

107
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,670
it wouldn't stay quiet.

108
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,777
It wouldn't let us pose it.

109
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,720
If Amita wants that pardon...

110
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,280
Let her have it.

111
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,110
Very well.

112
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,390
Sleep well, Ping'an.

113
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,110
Mr. Li.

114
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,040
Mr. Li.

115
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,350
Mr. Li.

116
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,910
Ms. Amita has a message for you.

117
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,360
Her task is done.

118
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,870
That fast?

119
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,790
Then, Mr. Li,

120
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,440
what time will you come by tomorrow?

121
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,000
I've been so busy lately.

122
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,990
I can't get away.

123
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,750
Could you ask Ms. Amita

124
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,510
to go to the barbican
at Small East Gate?

125
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,288
She'll see the one she's looking for.

126
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,360
I was told you are sharp and meticulous.

127
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,840
Seeing you today proves it's true.

128
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,120
Alright then, as you wish.

129
00:09:47,155 --> 00:09:49,800
See you at the Small East Gate
barbican tomorrow at si hour.

130
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,280
Farewell.

131
00:09:59,755 --> 00:10:01,440
How did I come across as meticulous?

132
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,350
What a dump.

133
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,630
Kid.

134
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,670
Where's Mr. Li?

135
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,270
He's up there.

136
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,470
Alright, go play.

137
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,500
(Litchi Preservation)

138
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,150
Tie that curtain tighter.

139
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,720
Mr. Li! Mr. Li!

140
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,470
Chief Scribe Zhao?

141
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,630
What brings you here?

142
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,844
Inspector He showed mercy.

143
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,320
He said since Mr. Li

144
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,200
pleaded for those soldiers,

145
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,630
the matter would be dropped.

146
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,910
This pardon order will also

147
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,510
be announced publicly.

148
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,080
So, those soldiers

149
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,320
are free men now?

150
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,480
Indeed.

151
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,470
Thank you, then.

152
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,630
Where are they now?

153
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,320
Well...

154
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,160
Let's see them.

155
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,670
I don't actually know where that guy is.

156
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:09,000
I don't know that group either.

157
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,960
But I need to pass

158
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,320
this message to that porter.

159
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,630
Either way,

160
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,200
please tell Inspector He

161
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,670
I'm grateful for his kindness.

162
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,200
They aren't here?

163
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:17,911
Nope.

164
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,422
But I came all the way here!

165
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,720
Why you little...

166
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,680
Much appreciated.

167
00:11:21,911 --> 00:11:23,200
I'm telling you, I trust you.

168
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,200
I'll take it as done.

169
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,280
Alright.

170
00:11:28,511 --> 00:11:29,288
Farewell.

171
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:30,133
Thanks for your help.

172
00:11:30,177 --> 00:11:30,870
I'm off.

173
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,590
Good heavens.

174
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,960
(Gaozhou)
Yan, look at this! Yan!

175
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,150
Yan Yazhuang, you're free!

176
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,120
From now on,

177
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,960
no more hiding.

178
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,390
Mr. Li.

179
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,910
You gave me a second chance at life.

180
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:47,777
I can never repay you.

181
00:11:47,777 --> 00:11:48,080
Alright.

182
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,880
Cut the nonsense.

183
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,870
Go get the dagger!

184
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,230
Go, hurry!

185
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,820
(Liu's Coconuts)

186
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,960
Godfather.

187
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
What is it, Amita?

188
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,910
I got this dagger

189
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,911
from that young soldier.

190
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,960
He said the man who owns this dagger

191
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,200
hijacked the medicine boat.

192
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,790
Godfather, take a good look.

193
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,720
Isn't this the dagger

194
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,044
my father gave you?

195
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,710
Everyone, out.

196
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,550
I never thought

197
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,960
after all these years,

198
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:14,870
it would end up back where it belongs.

199
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,510
Godfather.

200
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,240
Don't you have

201
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,320
something to explain?

202
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,955
I have a clear conscience.

203
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,150
There's nothing to explain.

204
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,480
Did my father

205
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,630
know you hijacked

206
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,670
that medicine boat?

207
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,040
Amita,

208
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,510
you came all this way

209
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,120
just to dig up

210
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,440
old scores with me?

211
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,750
If you really want answers,

212
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,630
I'll tell you the truth.

213
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,240
But I'm warning you,

214
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,960
once you hear it,

215
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,670
you might feel even worse.

216
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,160
Please, Godfather.

217
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,960
Alright.

218
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,150
Back then, your father
was desperate to surrender.

219
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,910
He was in a hurry

220
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,510
and rushed to create the Sea Sail Fund.

221
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
He wanted to build

222
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,030
a good name in Lingnan.

223
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,960
But after all, he was a pirate,

224
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,000
not a merchant.

225
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,360
He made promises to the people

226
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,120
that he couldn't keep.

227
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,720
Little by little,

228
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,030
the money dried up.

229
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,320
If things kept going like that,

230
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,360
everything would've gone down the drain.

231
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,790
I didn't want to watch him fall.

232
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,000
But there were things
he couldn't do out in the open.

233
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,080
Things only I could do for him.

234
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,550
So I thought,

235
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,440
one last big job.

236
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,150
That one job could bring in enough

237
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,600
to get your father through the crisis.

238
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,510
My plan was simple.

239
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,440
We'd patch the hole

240
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,870
with that money first,

241
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,360
then tell your father everything.

242
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,630
I'd confess and take the blame.

243
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,933
But who could've known...

244
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,510
the fire at Qijing Pavilion...

245
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,390
Your father never made it out.

246
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,630
You know what happened after that.

247
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,120
I took the brothers

248
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:41,111
and surrendered to the court.

249
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,120
We were officially accepted.

250
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,440
So in the end,

251
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,866
I finished what your father started
but never could.

252
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,920
Amita.

253
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,240
All these years, I never told you

254
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,390
because your father was already gone.

255
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,270
I just hoped

256
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,630
that in your heart,

257
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,000
he could always stay perfect.

258
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,320
Remember this.

259
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,480
Sometimes,

260
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,630
the truth hurts more than a lie.

261
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,750
When you're older,

262
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,030
maybe you'll understand

263
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,480
why I kept it from you.

264
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,200
No matter how cruel the truth is,

265
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,840
I don't want to live in a lie.

266
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,080
I understand.

267
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,480
All of you, get out.

268
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,480
Let's go.

269
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,760
You saw him?

270
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,000
I saw him.

271
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,822
Why isn't he dead yet?

272
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,377
How much longer is he going to live?

273
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:20,488
No need to rush, Sir.

274
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
During the siege test,

275
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,720
we'll find a good opportunity

276
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,480
to get rid of that problem for you.

277
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,880
You'd better not forget!

278
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,520
Ms. Amita.

279
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,280
Ms. Amita.

280
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,480
Have some bayberry milk
to cool off a little.

281
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,070
Do you think my godfather

282
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,000
was telling the truth?

283
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,070
I wouldn't dare to speculate.

284
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,550
But I know

285
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,960
Inspector He has always treated you

286
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,000
like his own daughter.

287
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,550
He's looked after you in every way.

288
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,160
Everyone can see that.

289
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,160
I believe

290
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,240
Inspector He would never lie to you.

291
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,310
But he said hijacking the medicine boat

292
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,000
was to help cover my father's losses.

293
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,160
But how much was the medicine worth?

294
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,110
How could that solve the crisis?

295
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,750
And right after that, came the fire

296
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,800
that killed my father.

297
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:30,880
Was all of that

298
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,110
really just a coincidence?

299
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,840
Ms. Amita.

300
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,400
There's no way to verify the past.

301
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,310
Don't torture yourself over it.

302
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,150
Right now,

303
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,510
we should prepare

304
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,550
for the court meeting.

305
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,830
I will find the truth.

306
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,070
You've scouted the whole route?

307
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,790
All of us

308
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,310
were born and raised in Lingnan.

309
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,822
We grew up knowing the paths.

310
00:19:07,044 --> 00:19:08,133
They're etched in our bones.

311
00:19:08,755 --> 00:19:09,880
There's just one problem.

312
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,590
Will the test run at night?

313
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,960
If it's a real mission,

314
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,440
it'll definitely run day and night.

315
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,480
(Gaozhou)
Moonlight doesn't make the road safer.

316
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,590
Riding at night is dangerous.

317
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,630
Wear this yourself.

318
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,400
We'll need torches along the way.

319
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,200
Torches and oil.

320
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,440
We must prepare these.

321
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:30,430
Don't worry about that.

322
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,960
I'll cover the costs.

323
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,720
Li Shande.

324
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,480
Su is here.

325
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,430
Mr. Li!

326
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,910
Su.

327
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,830
- This is Di, one of my men.
- Pour it in.

328
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,720
He used to trade horses.

329
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,510
He'll stay and help you with the horses.

330
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
That's great!

331
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,750
Much appreciated.

332
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,030
Let me introduce you.

333
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,440
Di, this is Tong.

334
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,280
This is Li.

335
00:20:00,311 --> 00:20:01,590
If you need anything, ask them.

336
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,333
These are the horse experts.

337
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,720
This is perfect.

338
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,790
If Yan could bring

339
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,790
a few more riders,

340
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,800
that'd be even better.

341
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,910
Exactly.

342
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,560
Mr. Li.

343
00:20:11,822 --> 00:20:13,240
Stop pacing around so nervously.

344
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,840
Be like me,

345
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:15,870
and become

346
00:20:15,888 --> 00:20:17,755
a steely turtle
with a lead weight in its gut.

347
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,440
Let's talk in private.

348
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,800
Go on, keep working.

349
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,110
A donkey pulls the grind and runs laps.

350
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,160
This test surely

351
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,155
won't be the only one, right?

352
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,040
Right.

353
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,720
The more tests we do,
the more solid the outcome.

354
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,840
I get that.

355
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,160
But a single trip around the city

356
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,680
costs hundreds of guan.

357
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,110
Hundreds today,

358
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,550
and hundreds again tomorrow.

359
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,590
Over and over again,

360
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,960
my money pouch

361
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,720
won't be able to handle it.

362
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,510
So I've come up with

363
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,840
a new plan.

364
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,160
Can you guess what it is?

365
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,680
You're not asking
for more travel passes, are you?

366
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,030
I swear I won't

367
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,310
ask for your pangolin again.

368
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,590
This time, I'll get a few iron turtles

369
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,510
from the Hu merchants.

370
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
Can they help?

371
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,080
Don't worry.

372
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,720
I'll fish, and they'll bite the bait.

373
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,590
We rise and fall together.

374
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,350
I understand that well,

375
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,750
and so will they.

376
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,310
As long as they see

377
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,480
your magic touch,

378
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,000
how litchis can reach Chang'an,

379
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,200
they'll hand over those turtles

380
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,977
without hesitation.

381
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,640
Su, look.

382
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,240
Even just this test run has already

383
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,790
a lot of pressure on me.

384
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,760
You know?

385
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,680
I know, I know.

386
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,480
Mr. Li,

387
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,550
when I came back to Lingnan,

388
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,760
what caught my eye

389
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,440
was only this one business.

390
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,240
If it succeeds, then we both

391
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,270
have a shot at survival.

392
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,640
Do your best without worry.

393
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,240
I'll grit my teeth and stick with you

394
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,640
to the end.

395
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,070
Since you're that committed, Su,

396
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,000
I'll give it my all.

397
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:47,400
Every year, the Hu merchants gather
at the trade meeting

398
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,200
to discuss

399
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,110
next year's ventures.

400
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,070
Whoever can lead the way to big profits
will get the most support.

401
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:55,488
You should go join the fun.

402
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,350
No need to join the fun.

403
00:22:58,488 --> 00:23:00,288
Everyone is bound to support Amita.

404
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,720
Who would dare

405
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,222
go against the Inspector's Office?

406
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,510
That doesn't mean

407
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,750
they aren't tempted.

408
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,110
They have been

409
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,200
eager to make a move.

410
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,200
Join them

411
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,590
as the Right Chancellor's envoy

412
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,680
and cause some disruption.

413
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,240
If Amita

414
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,510
loses her spot as the leader,

415
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,550
she'll become

416
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,911
a discarded pawn to He Youguang.

417
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,480
Your wedge is driven in.

418
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,510
Poor Amita.

419
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:26,920
She's done all the dirty work

420
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,030
for He Youguang,

421
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,960
yet he still treats her

422
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,030
like nothing but a pawn.

423
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,000
What now?

424
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,790
Feeling a little pity?

425
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,110
No.

426
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,880
Just lamenting her fate.

427
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,480
When will she finally realize?

428
00:23:43,311 --> 00:23:44,422
When will people like her

429
00:23:44,977 --> 00:23:46,350
learn to stand on their own?

430
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,711
Be like you, Master Konglang.

431
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,750
You're so capable,

432
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,070
and so influential.

433
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,240
Then, they wouldn't

434
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,349
get dragged into this mess.

435
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,110
Don't speak like

436
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,070
you know me well.

437
00:23:58,555 --> 00:23:59,630
I'd like to know you.

438
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,040
Yan.

439
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,990
Mr. Li.

440
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,030
My comrades are here.

441
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,310
Mr. Li, you're a lifesaver.

442
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,400
We'll go through

443
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,830
fire and storms to transport it.

444
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,640
We'll follow your every command.

445
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,400
We'll follow your every command.

446
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,190
Quick, get up.

447
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,960
Help them up.

448
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,800
Get up.

449
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,790
Wonderful timing!

450
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,200
You've all saved my life.

451
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,830
With help from fine folks like you,

452
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,800
and real experts too,

453
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,750
I feel like a weight

454
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,640
has been lifted.

455
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,640
No time to rest.

456
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,830
To the Small East Gate.

457
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,670
Let's go.

458
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,110
These past few days,

459
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,790
everyone's been working tirelessly.
Well done.

460
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,320
Tomorrow,

461
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,000
we officially begin the litchi

462
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,920
transport trial.

463
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:12,160
- Great!
- Excellent!

464
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,240
Mr. Li,

465
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,960
if it's still raining tomorrow,

466
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,840
do we continue?

467
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,670
We will.

468
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,480
No matter what the weather is tomorrow,

469
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,320
we're doing it.

470
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,160
If heaven gives us a hard time,

471
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,400
even better.

472
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,920
That way the numbers we get

473
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:24,950
will be accurate.

474
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,280
Exactly.

475
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,760
Look.

476
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,800
Originally,

477
00:25:28,844 --> 00:25:29,830
what I had in mind was,

478
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,350
one person, one horse,

479
00:25:31,355 --> 00:25:32,310
taking turns in a relay

480
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,480
to complete this trial.

481
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,640
But just now, I thought,

482
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,840
this time,

483
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,200
let's use two riders with two horses.

484
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,120
That way,

485
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,960
if one horse slips up,

486
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,960
or something happens,

487
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,400
or we run into trouble

488
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,720
we didn't see coming,

489
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,560
the horse behind

490
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,350
can make up for it, right?

491
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,790
Then, we can still finish the trial.

492
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,000
It's like a safety measure.

493
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,240
That means we'll need to prepare

494
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,080
more litchis.

495
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,960
Yeah, double the litchis, right?

496
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,200
So hurry and notify the garden

497
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,110
to bring over the rest

498
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,110
of the jars.

499
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,110
Got it.

500
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,590
By the third quarter

501
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,440
of the Mao Hour,
all the fresh litchis

502
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,960
must be delivered to Small East Gate.

503
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,066
An hour into the Mao Hour,
we begin salt soaking.

504
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,440
15 minutes later,

505
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,200
breakfast must be ready.

506
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,830
By the Chen Hour,

507
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,270
all riders set off for the trial.

508
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,590
One more thing.

509
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,110
Our riders

510
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,133
have the toughest job.

511
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,790
We must make sure

512
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,000
they're well-fed.

513
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,600
Yes.

514
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,488
All ingredients must
be washed thoroughly

515
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,590
and picked fresh.

516
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,070
Tell the cook to maintain

517
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,190
good hygiene.

518
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,120
No food poisoning.

519
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,990
Don't worry.

520
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,350
You're in charge of this.

521
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,430
Got it.

522
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,480
During the trial,

523
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,550
we'll switch to four meals a day.

524
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,750
At sunrise, noon,

525
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,030
sunset, and midnight.

526
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,040
Right on the clock.

527
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,350
It will be tough,

528
00:26:42,377 --> 00:26:43,590
but you take shifts in pairs.

529
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,670
Yes.

530
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,310
Hao? Where is Hao?

531
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,350
Here, Mr. Li!

532
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:47,960
Hao,

533
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,680
handle fetching and changing the water.

534
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,680
Remember, for these double-layer jars,

535
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,977
the tops must be sealed tight.

536
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:54,310
When loaded on the horses,

537
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,480
they must be tied down.

538
00:26:55,644 --> 00:26:57,110
Got it. Seal tight, and tie tight.

539
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,760
Seal tight.

540
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,333
Di, you're in charge of the horses.

541
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,480
After each lap,

542
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,444
switch rider and horse.

543
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:02,440
Li will assist you

544
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,240
with the cleaning,

545
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,080
feeding, and bedding.

546
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,190
Li,

547
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,070
light the torches

548
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,350
to guide the riders

549
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,830
in the mountains at dusk.

550
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,520
Mr. Li.

551
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,960
You just said we'd switch up

552
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,760
every lap.

553
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,110
But each lap takes

554
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,133
less than half an hour.

555
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:17,270
With just these few horses,

556
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,133
they barely rest
before it's their turn again.

557
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,550
I was thinking
maybe we switch riders every lap

558
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,790
but horses every three.

559
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,790
That way the horses can run more

560
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,070
and rest more too.

561
00:27:26,755 --> 00:27:28,030
Otherwise, the horses will die

562
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,870
from exhaustion.

563
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,150
What do you think?

564
00:27:31,755 --> 00:27:32,870
Let's go with your plan.

565
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,720
One rider per lap,

566
00:27:34,777 --> 00:27:36,030
and one horse every three laps.

567
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,560
Tomorrow,

568
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,110
Lan and Yan

569
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,440
will ride the two best horses

570
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,280
and start things off.

571
00:27:41,422 --> 00:27:42,790
As for the rest of the riders,

572
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,310
I'll put the rotation

573
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,680
on a chart.

574
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,680
You'll all see it.

575
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,830
If a rider up front

576
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,350
has an issue,

577
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,030
the next one steps in by order.

578
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,030
Follow the sequence.

579
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,440
One more thing.

580
00:27:52,577 --> 00:27:53,680
During the trial, the riders

581
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,790
will have it the hardest.

582
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,720
We must make sure

583
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,200
they get proper rest and sleep.

584
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,350
When they're resting,

585
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,309
keep the noise down.

586
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,022
Don't disturb them.

587
00:28:00,066 --> 00:28:01,960
And riders, try
to fall asleep quickly too.

588
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:03,870
Let me think...

589
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,560
Well...

590
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,160
This trial run for sure

591
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,720
is going to bring challenges

592
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,160
we never imagined.

593
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,110
Let's all work together.

594
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,070
If anything comes up, let me know.

595
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,160
If I run into issues,

596
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,310
I'll tell everyone too.
Keep communicating, alright?

597
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:17,750
Alright.

598
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,960
- Alright.
- Sounds good!

599
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,160
I thank you all in advance.

600
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,590
Tomorrow,

601
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:27,000
I'll be counting on all of you
to work as one.

602
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,911
Help me fight for a solid result.

603
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,830
Good!

604
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,720

00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,070
Your singing is too loud.

630
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,830
That could invite a vengeful spirit!

631
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,000
Hurry up.

632
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,030
We must deliver these

633
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:40,911
to Small East Gate.

634
00:31:40,955 --> 00:31:42,440

I'm scared.

643
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,200
I've never put this much money

644
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,510
into something

645
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,088
with almost no chance of success.

646
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,680
A stone was thrown,

647
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,550
and an arrow loosed.

648
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:04,960
What good is

649
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,800
worrying now?

650
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,590
If you don't get sleep,

651
00:33:08,022 --> 00:33:09,644
how will you last the next few days?

652
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,870
I'll be fine.

653
00:33:12,977 --> 00:33:14,377
The couriers should be back

654
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,155
by the third quarter of the Mao Hour.

655
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,130
It's starting!

656
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,470
Let's go!

657
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,110
Here, eat it while it's hot.

658
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,040
Alright.

659
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,590
Alright.

660
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,880
Time to eat!

661
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,070
Come eat your food!

662
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:26,960
Come on!

663
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,150
Eat up!

664
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,680
Come on and eat!

665
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,470
Careful, it's hot.

666
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,120
Li Shande!

667
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,160
Come eat your food!

668
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,480
Li, stop adding more.

669
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,030
- It'll burn.
- It's already done.

670
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,200
Mr. Li!

671
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,230
Have a banana.

672
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,510
Thanks.

673
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,550
Mr. Li, Mr. Li!

674
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,030
Come here!

675
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,150
Come eat with us!

676
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,550
Come on!

677
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:09,950
What's wrong?

678
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,590
Look at our litchi grove.

679
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,480
No, listen.

680
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,590
They won't grow in grass.

681
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,190
Plant them in the soil.

682
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,666
They can't even be in the sun
for the first few days.

683
00:35:21,022 --> 00:35:22,030
Plant them in the soil,

684
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,466
or the horses will trample them soon.

685
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:24,622
Come on, get your food.

686
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:31,950
Set it down.

687
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,088
Set it, go ahead.

688
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,600
Put it down.

689
00:35:36,466 --> 00:35:38,000
- Go on, set it down.
- Go for it.

690
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,150
Keep going. Lay it down. Go on.

691
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,200
- Alright.
- Yes.

692
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:41,960
Great.

693
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,070
Wonderful.

694
00:35:43,733 --> 00:35:44,760
Everyone, take a look.

695
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,190
I've sorted the test results

696
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,630
based on distance traveled

697
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,550
and marked them
in four different colors.

698
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,400
The ones with black rings stayed fresh.

699
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,640
Hand me the stick.

700
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,760
Ochre dots mean color changed.

701
00:35:59,977 --> 00:36:01,666
Purple dots mean the scent changed.

702
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:03,150
Red dots mean the flavor changed.

703
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,440
Ink dots mean
they started leaking juice.

704
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,030
Alright.

705
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,840
That way, the distance traveled

706
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,070
and the litchis' condition

707
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,400
are all crystal clear.

708
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,070
Right? One more thing...

709
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:14,920
Hey...

710
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,000
Don't yank my leg hair!

711
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,733
I'm holding you steady.

712
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,190
Every day from now on,

713
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,510
we'll hang a flag on the wall.

714
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,320
That way, you will know exactly

715
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,711
what day of the trial we're on.

716
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,480
Got it?

717
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,280
- Yes
- Got it

718
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:26,960
Good. That's all.

719
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,960
- Alright
- Alright

720
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,190
Inspector He is here.

721
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:33,990
Why is he here?

722
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,990
Li, get up!

723
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,360
Not here!

724
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:38,990
Go!

725
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,760
Welcome, Inspector He.

726
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,840
Welcome, Inspector He.

727
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,630
You may rise.

728
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,440
Thank you, Inspector He.

729
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:07,950
Mr. Li,

730
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,511
I heard you're running the trial today,

731
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,550
so Inspector He came to observe.

732
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,440
It's just a test.

733
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,920
You're a busy man,

734
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,977
I shouldn't trouble you.

735
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,640
Mr. Li,

736
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,150
no need to be so formal.

737
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,110
This litchi delivery

738
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,230
is an affair the court takes seriously.

739
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,430
Naturally,

740
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,377
it's something I take seriously too.

741
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,760
Fellow people of Gaozhou.

742
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,800
- Yes!
- Yes!

743
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,550
Something big is happening

744
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,360
right here in Gaozhou.

745
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,150
We have a court-appointed
Mr. Li among us.

746
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,400
Mr. Li is devoting himself

747
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,030
to delivering litchis to His Majesty.

748
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,710
He wants to bring

749
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,880
our fresh Gaozhou litchis

750
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,510
all the way to Chang'an.

751
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,230
But we all know,

752
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,630
it's 2500 km
from Lingnan to Chang'an.

753
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,960
And litchis go bad in three days.

754
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,977
So how do we deliver them?

755
00:38:04,977 --> 00:38:06,110
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

756
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,840
But Mr. Li has a way.

757
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,190
He has a way!

758
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,150
Mr. Li wants to borrow

759
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,510
Small East Gate

760
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,000
to do a trial.

761
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,840
If this trial succeeds,

762
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,110
then Gaozhou's litchis

763
00:38:20,177 --> 00:38:21,844
will be famous across the land.

764
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,440
- Wonderful!
- Good!

765
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:29,880
- Wonderful!
- Good!

766
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,440
I thank Inspector He for the support.

767
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,155
I wouldn't dare slack off.

768
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,710
I won't let His Majesty down.

769
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:38,030
Let's wait and see.

770
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,230
Wishing Mr. Li great success.

771
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,800
Great!

772
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,200
Oiled paper.

773
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,640
Stuff it in.

774
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,680
Rope.

775
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,840
I know you came from wealth.

776
00:39:38,444 --> 00:39:39,800
Your father gathered fine horses

777
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,070
from both north and south.

778
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,840
You became an excellent rider.

779
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,280
I heard you love racing too.

780
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,960
Even lost a stable over it.

781
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,110
I was young back then.

782
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,670
I fell into a scoundrel's trap.

783
00:39:52,711 --> 00:39:54,444
Something went wrong with my horse.

784
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,680
Totally despicable.

785
00:39:56,111 --> 00:39:57,480
But it wasn't a pointless loss.

786
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,280
This time, bring that same energy

787
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,550
when you lost the stable.

788
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,670
Push the limits and gallop fast.

789
00:40:02,911 --> 00:40:04,670
But in truth,
make it slow and unreliable.

790
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,280
Got it?

791
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:08,950
Chief Scribe Zhao,

792
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,630
they call me

793
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,844
the Shadowless Rider of Lingnan.

794
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,190
I don't want to look sloppy.

795
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,022
They can say I'm bad at cockfighting,

796
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,400
but I don't want to hear

797
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,360
that I don't know how to ride.

798
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,440
Isn't that all empty praise?

799
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,400
Back then, your father was rich.

800
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,360
Others lost to you

801
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,280
just to go collect a reward from him.

802
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,155
Aren't you too old to be this prideful?

803
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:29,840
Look.

804
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,911
Have you ever won
after your family had fallen?

805
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:32,960
If Inspector He

806
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,110
didn't support your business,

807
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,288
you'd be dead by now.

808
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,390
Think it through.

809
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,111
Quit dreaming about your title.

810
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,240
From now on,

811
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,866
you are Inspector He's pawn.

812
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,200
Don't forget it.

813
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,320
Slow down.

814
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,430
Mr. Li.

815
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:57,670
Tie it tighter.

816
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,510
Lan.

817
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,680
It's heavy.

818
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,940
(Cargo B)

819
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,200
Lan.

820
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,733
Stick close to me later.

821
00:41:07,822 --> 00:41:08,733
I'll lead the way.

822
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,550
You mean I have to

823
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,670
run behind you, huh?

824
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:14,960
That's not what I meant.

825
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,510
I just know the route better.

826
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,510
If I turn around

827
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,000
and don't see you,

828
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,670
you're on your own.

829
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,200
So you're pretty good too, huh?

830
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,920
I thought you were too old

831
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,466
to race anymore.

832
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,422
Cocky, huh?

833
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,070
My back is just fine.

834
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,150
Alright. Then let's have

835
00:41:43,155 --> 00:41:44,150
a proper match later.

836
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,640
Mr. Li.

837
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,630
Let's go.

838
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:30,500
=The Litchi Road=

839
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,070
Go!

840
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,280
If fresh litchis

841
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,510
make it to Chang'an...

842
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,880
If Noble Consort tastes them,

843
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,720
she'll say,

844
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,760
"Delicious."

845
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,710
"I want more. Are there any left?"

846
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,800
Think about it.

847
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,360
What kind of business is this?

848
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,230
Even if people can take it,

849
00:42:52,355 --> 00:42:53,320
what about the horses?

850
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,070
They'll be worn out.

851
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,190
They can barely last half a day.

852
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,110
