00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,999
=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,180
You came.

3
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,940
(To Free Oneself: Two)

4
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,260
Good.

5
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,060
Sir.

6
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,460
Have another drink.

7
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,980
It's autumn now.

8
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,300
Don't catch a cold.

9
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:13,380
Is there any news about Mr. Xue?

10
00:02:15,555 --> 00:02:17,222
According to someone from his hometown,

11
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,620
he's running around

12
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,880
to raise money.

13
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,740
He's still raising money?

14
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:23,900
He's raising money

15
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,770
for his cousin, Li.

16
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:28,022
Mr. Xue's family
arranged a marriage for them.

17
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,620
She's from a wealthy family.

18
00:02:29,622 --> 00:02:31,210
They agreed on a hefty betrothal price.

19
00:02:31,244 --> 00:02:32,090
If he can't afford it,

20
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,550
they won't marry their daughter to him.

21
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,500
He's running around

22
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,830
to raise money for this.

23
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,860
Heaven is cruel

24
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,030
to let such a scum

25
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,580
exist in this world.

26
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,620
You lost sleep

27
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,480
and skipped meals

28
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,620
for him.

29
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,244
He's not worth it.

30
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:28,140
Hurry.

31
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,100
Next.

32
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:31,300
Come in.

33
00:03:34,955 --> 00:03:36,100
Turn.

34
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:44,990
You've already

35
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,160
seen everyone

36
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,000
here.

37
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,620
I really can't think

38
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,644
of other candidates.

39
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,380
Her.

40
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,060
Get up.

41
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,020
What are you doing?

42
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,790
What are you doing? Let go!

43
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,140
Leave.

44
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,400
Do you

45
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,733
find this hairpin familiar?

46
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,960
Your Mr. Xue

47
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,688
gave it to me when he came to Chang'an
a few days ago.

48
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,955
Mr. Xue.

49
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,888
I asked him if he was here to see you,

50
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,533
but he said
he was here for the shopkeeper.

51
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,420
This is the deposit

52
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,177
you paid to redeem Madam Shiqi.

53
00:04:58,177 --> 00:04:59,200
I'll return it to you.

54
00:04:59,244 --> 00:05:01,288
We won't owe each other anything
from now on.

55
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,300
Thank you.

56
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,700
I've been busy for half a year

57
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,177
and now I'm almost done.

58
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,900
This hairpin is expensive.

59
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:24,540
You want me to return it to Madam Shiqi?

60
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,111
No.

61
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,088
I want to make more money from it.

62
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,740
You scum.

63
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,820
You're even more heartless than me.

64
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,260
Get lost!

65
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,720
Let go of me!

66
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,660
There's a fire! Run!

67
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,955
Looks like
I was a poor judge of character.

68
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:27,666
The shopkeeper refused to take it.

69
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,300
This hairpin is exquisite

70
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,980
and I wanted to show it to you,

71
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,090
so I asked Mr. Xue

72
00:06:33,177 --> 00:06:34,533
whether he would sell it to me.

73
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,711
Mr. Xue was very hesitant at first.

74
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,860
I thought

75
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,666
he probably recalled the beating.

76
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,500
Guess what he said.

77
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,380
Stop.

78
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,488
He said one night of passion...

79
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,177
can make up for a thousand gold.

80
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,980
Since you like this hairpin

81
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,300
so much,

82
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,600
you can have it as a souvenir.

83
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,260
Hurry!

84
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,900
Madam Shiqi.

85
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,060
=Episode 28=

86
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,420
Liangyuan.

87
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,700
Liangyuan.

88
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,100
Congratulations.

89
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:30,780
You worked hard.

90
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,940
Congratulations, Mr. Li.

91
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,022
Mr. Li.

92
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,980
Liangyuan.

93
00:09:59,755 --> 00:10:01,040
Something big has happened.

94
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,660
Everyone, get out.

95
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,340
Close the door.

96
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:03,950
What happened?

97
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,800
Something is terrible!

98
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,733
What happened?

99
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,390
Don't tell me something's wrong

100
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,888
with Leyou Garden's old peonies again.

101
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:09,880
It's Li Shande,

102
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,555
who took care of the old peonies.

103
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,700
What happened?

104
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,860
He met Right Chancellor.

105
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,710
Supervisor Qu.

106
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,040
Are you going to believe gossip?

107
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,670
If he can meet Right Chancellor,

108
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,580
I can meet His Majesty.

109
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,100
It's true.

110
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,620
Just now, Li Shande

111
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,050
knelt in the palace gate's corridor

112
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,700
and desperately stopped
Right Chancellor.

113
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,080
Officials passing by saw it.

114
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,370
It can't be false.

115
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,290
Are you saying Li Shande,

116
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,420
who talks to plants,

117
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,890
looks like a walking jinx,

118
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,110
and is probably so bitter

119
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,570
you could squeeze huanglian juice

120
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,390
out of him,

121
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,800
stopped Right Chancellor?

122
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,830
Has he lost his mind?

123
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,390
He hid his true strength.

124
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,660
My brother told me everything.

125
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,540
He said

126
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,090
he would present
the method for litchi transport

127
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,420
to Right Chancellor,

128
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,700
in the hope that harmony among kin

129
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,777
could comfort His Majesty.

130
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,660
He's good.

131
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,155
He's good.

132
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,480
Right Chancellor's connection
to Noble Consort

133
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,622
is what secures His Majesty's favor.

134
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,460
That really hit

135
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,244
Right Chancellor's sweet spot.

136
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,900
Supervisor Qu.

137
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,370
Is it true?

138
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,950
Absolutely.

139
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,100
Who would've thought Li Shande

140
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,800
could flatter others like that?

141
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,690
None of us can compare to him!

142
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,740
No.

143
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,340
No.

144
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,520
Now that he found favor

145
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,010
with Right Chancellor,

146
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,120
will he come back

147
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,400
to settle old scores with us?

148
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,960
What should we do?

149
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,380
Everyone.

150
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,110
We have to think of a solution.

151
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,950
Everyone.

152
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,820
Where's Chief Liu?

153
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,500
Mr. Li.

154
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,540
Where's Chief Liu?

155
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,100
Mr. Li.

156
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,380
You should've informed us
ahead of your visit

157
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,111
so that we could have been
better prepared.

158
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:12,860
Yes.

159
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,300
Have you had breakfast?

160
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,460
No need.

161
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,620
Where's Chief Liu?

162
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,500
What do you want?

163
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,990
We can help you.

164
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,820
Well...

165
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,860
Yes, you

166
00:12:23,933 --> 00:12:25,110
don't have to come tomorrow.

167
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,020
Well...

168
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,940
Mr. Li.

169
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,580
I never intended for you

170
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,730
to handle

171
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,410
the peonies' pest issue.

172
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,940
I'm sorry.

173
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,260
I'm sorry.

174
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,260
I apologize.

175
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,100
Mr. Li.

176
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,260
You don't have to do this. Get up.

177
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,260
I dare not.

178
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:47,620
Get up.

179
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,220
I dare not.

180
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,420
Don't you feel anything

181
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,780
seeing him like this? Get up.

182
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,620
Mr. Li.

183
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,420
I lied that day that my brother
was out on business.

184
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,100
Did I delay your work?

185
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,200
I deserve to be beaten
for my wretched mouth.

186
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,780
I deserve to be beaten.

187
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,780
I'm not talking about the peonies.

188
00:13:02,844 --> 00:13:04,060
It's not about the peonies.

189
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,060
It's not about the peonies?

190
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,333
It's about the imperial edict then.

191
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,190
Mr. Li.

192
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,910
I put up...

193
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,660
I put up the notice that day,

194
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,420
but that was everyone's idea.

195
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,980
Mr. Li, I...

196
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,940
I deserve to die.

197
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,500
I deserve to be beaten.

198
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,080
I could hear yelling in the office

199
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,070
from afar.

200
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,830
Why are all of you kneeling?

201
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,260
Chief Liu.

202
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,880
Li Shande?

203
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,140
Li Shande, how bold of you?

204
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:42,555
How dare you cause a scene
in Shanglin Office

205
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,610
and force my colleagues
to kneel down and self-harm?

206
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,266
Get up. All of you, get up.

207
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,560
Get up.

208
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,490
Chief.

209
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,155
I have something to discuss with you.

210
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,060
Discuss my foot.

211
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,220
Get lost immediately.

212
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,200
Had the Minister of Agriculture
not come to inspect our office today,

213
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,660
I would have reported you for misconduct

214
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,610
and broken your legs.

215
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,250
Chief.

216
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,490
Chief Liu.

217
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,160
Chief Liu loves you so much

218
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,150
that he's strict with you.

219
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,590
He always told us

220
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,460
that you're the most capable person

221
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,020
in Shanglin Office.

222
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,780
Yes.

223
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,890
You're now

224
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,120
Litchi Envoy.

225
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,840
He works for Right Chancellor.

226
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,620
Yes.

227
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,060
Right Chancellor.

228
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,040
What show are you trying to put on?

229
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,580
I don't have time to act with you today.

230
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,980
Get lost.

231
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,060
Don't offend Minister of Agriculture.

232
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,300
You hear me?

233
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,244
Who wants to offend me?

234
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:49,130
Greetings, Minister of Agriculture.

235
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,790
Pardon me
for not coming out to greet you.

236
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,140
Your visit...

237
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:53,980
Shut up!

238
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,860
Mr. Li.

239
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,060
Why are you here?

240
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,740
You didn't inform me

241
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,300
Mr. Li is here.

242
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,622
You made me seem rude.

243
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,460
I had the honor

244
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,610
of seeing you talking calmly

245
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,980
to Right Chancellor.

246
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,530
We're

247
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,190
very impressed.

248
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,180
Mr. Li, I

249
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,000
found you extraordinary back then.

250
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,580
You had endless energy

251
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:29,511
when you first arrived
at Bureau of Agriculture.

252
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,180
I told you

253
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,420
to spend your energy

254
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,190
on more important things.

255
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,780
Look.

256
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,688
You accomplished it now, right?

257
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,850
I reluctantly transferred you away

258
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,540
to see

259
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,860
what you've become today.

260
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,630
Mr. Li.

261
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,860
Why did you come to Shanglin Office?

262
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,600
I have something to discuss
with Chief Liu.

263
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,790
Since you're here to inspect,

264
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,980
I'll wait.

265
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:58,740
No.

266
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,950
Your business

267
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,700
is more important.

268
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,540
Since you're here to oversee things,

269
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,660
I'll leave you alone.

270
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,780
Mr. Li, continue with your work.

271
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,980
How do you do your job as an official?

272
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,020
Was I

273
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,060
a bit too talkative just now?

274
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,300
Well...

275
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,540
Can we talk business now?

276
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,700
Please get up.

277
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,460
Feel free to speak.

278
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,860
Tomorrow,

279
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,660
I want to gather Ministry of War,

280
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:50,639
Carriage Bureau,
two offices of Military Geography,

281
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,666
Court of the Imperial Stud,
Imperial Stables Bureau,

282
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,239
Imperial Pasture Bureaus near Chang'an,

283
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,650
Ministry of Revenue, Bureau
of General Accounts, Granary Bureau,

284
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,510
Finance Bureau, Imperial Household
Department, Left Storage Office,

285
00:16:59,511 --> 00:17:01,580
and the chiefs of various offices

286
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,420
to discuss the litchi transport.

287
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,340
I want to borrow Shanglin Office's

288
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,620
official residence.

289
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,180
Liangyuan.

290
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,620
Don't just borrow
the official residence.

291
00:17:15,555 --> 00:17:16,780
I'll lend you the staff too.

292
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,740
Today, put

293
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:21,820
your work aside

294
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,140
and help Mr. Li
summon the various offices.

295
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,580
Come to Shanglin Office tomorrow

296
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,133
and wait for Mr. Li's orders.

297
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,740
- Yes.
- Yes.

298
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,220
Thank you.

299
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,900
Don't mention it.

300
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,380
Attendant Yu.

301
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,700
Li Shande stopped Right Chancellor

302
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,540
in the corridor

303
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,688
and explained
the litchi transport method in detail.

304
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,220
Just as you expected,

305
00:18:05,422 --> 00:18:07,600
he recommended you to help
with the litchi transport

306
00:18:07,644 --> 00:18:08,688
to Right Chancellor.

307
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,100
But Right Chancellor said

308
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,820
to discuss this later.

309
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,940
Will all our efforts

310
00:18:15,977 --> 00:18:18,200
just end up
making things easier for Li Shande?

311
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,820
He's angry at me

312
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,340
for not telling him,

313
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,900
even though I knew about it.

314
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,060
Attendant Yu.

315
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,460
I don't understand.

316
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,410
Why didn't you tell Right Chancellor

317
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,340
when you knew he would be angry?

318
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,220
Right Chancellor
likes to manipulate people

319
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,420
but dislikes
overindulging his subordinates.

320
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,220
What he gives you is yours.

321
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,533
If he doesn't give it to you,

322
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,420
you can't rob it.

323
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,900
I'm already responsible
for the purchase

324
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,540
of Noble Consort's birthday banquet.

325
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,180
If I openly go after

326
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,420
the litchi transport,

327
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,060
we might anger him.

328
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,660
How can we land this big catch then?

329
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,980
I...

330
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,220
can get Right Chancellor
to give it to me.

331
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,580
(Xiang's Pastry Shop)

332
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,140
Here's the payment.

333
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,740
- Sir.
- Sir.

334
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,466
Give it to me.

335
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:33,620
(Xiang's Pastry Shop)

336
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,230
How did you find out

337
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,866
that Li Shande wanted these Yulu balls?

338
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,740
I went to Left Storage Office
to pass on a message.

339
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,340
And his classmate told me.

340
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,260
Li Shande came to this shop

341
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,980
to buy Yulu balls for him.

342
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,320
If something in Chang'an City

343
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,020
becomes popular suddenly,

344
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,420
it must be
because someone has been promoted

345
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,044
and is widely acclaimed.

346
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,260
Director Ma.

347
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,100
Director Ma.

348
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,060
Why are you...

349
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,660
Look at this.

350
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,310
I'm getting more confused.

351
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,860
A few days ago, Attendant Yu

352
00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:25,380
secretly asked us to give the approval.

353
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,540
But Li Shande

354
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,300
got Right Chancellor's silver token.

355
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,070
Why would Attendant Yu help Li Shande?

356
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,620
You don't know.

357
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,020
Attendant Yu

358
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,460
has always been meticulous

359
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,180
and will leave himself a way out.

360
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,180
Let's just wait and see what happens.

361
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,540
But I'm afraid that those
who offended him will suffer.

362
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,570
Looks like many people

363
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,280
have offended him.

364
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,500
Because of your flattery,

365
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,620
someone

366
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,290
who has never offended him

367
00:21:01,733 --> 00:21:03,888
has to flatter him too.

368
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,140
Otherwise,
Ministry of War would look like

369
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,460
we're ignoring him.

370
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:12,650
Please.

371
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,510
Director Ma.

372
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,190
My brother often mentions you.

373
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,100
Please.

374
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,160
Please.

375
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,400
Pardon me.

376
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,740
You worked hard.

377
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,650
Pardon me.

378
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:46,990
Father.

379
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,560
Can I have a drink of water?

380
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,760
No.

381
00:21:50,022 --> 00:21:51,822
Your stomach bloats
after drinking water.

382
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,060
Once that happens,

383
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,140
you can't swallow anything.

384
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,060
Keep eating.

385
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,180
I really can't eat anymore.

386
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,420
Why did they send

387
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,820
so many Yulu balls today?

388
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,020
Don't talk. Eat.

389
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,740
Maybe it's because

390
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,900
I won a silver token today.

391
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:10,933
Can this silver token
be exchanged for Yulu balls?

392
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,480
You'll get more than Yulu balls.

393
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:14,940
If your father

394
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,060
wants a house or a land,

395
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:18,360
someone will give it to him.

396
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,380
Really?

397
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,950
Stop chatting. Eat.

398
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,460
It's five coins each.

399
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:24,920
It won't be fresh tomorrow.

400
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,760
Hurry.

401
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,160
Amita, eat.

402
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,150
Hurry and eat.

403
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,500
Is Mr. Li home?

404
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,680
Who is it?

405
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,940
Mr. Li.

406
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,140
Madam Shiqi.

407
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,790
I came too late after all.

408
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,450
Looks like Mr. Li

409
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,600
no longer lacks this.

410
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,020
Madam Shiqi.

411
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,860
I've gotten the approval.

412
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,780
My deed...

413
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,060
My deed is also with you.

414
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,520
Don't worry.

415
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,220
I will pay you back.

416
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,300
You didn't even let me inside.

417
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,660
You don't welcome me?

418
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,380
Do you think I only brought Yulu balls?

419
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,340
I have

420
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,180
something you've been
thinking about day and night.

421
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,300
Just speak your mind.

422
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,290
Why are you here today?

423
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,820
I really envy your luck

424
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,500
to have found yourself

425
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,866
such a distinguished husband.

426
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,300
He's not my husband.

427
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,660
I told you last time.

428
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,660
Do you remember

429
00:23:46,111 --> 00:23:47,300
what you told me last time?

430
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,540
You said

431
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,020
I helped him

432
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,177
when he needed help the most.

433
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:53,800
Now that you

434
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,190
gained Right Chancellor's favor,

435
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,660
don't forget me

436
00:23:58,822 --> 00:24:00,333
when you become successful.

437
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,660
I can't forget you.

438
00:24:02,711 --> 00:24:04,088
I still have to pay you back.

439
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,300
Mr. Li is such a joker.

440
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,110
Let me tell you the truth.

441
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,260
Rats

442
00:24:11,977 --> 00:24:13,420
have long eaten that debt contract.

443
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,060
What ties us isn't debt,

444
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:20,820
but friendship.

445
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,340
Keep the deed safe.

446
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:24,600
I won't disturb

447
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,710
your family reunion.

448
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,800
I'll go now.

449
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,450
Father, what does she mean?

450
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,570
She's giving us back our stuff.

451
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,060
Continue eating.

452
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,580
(Southern Plants)

453
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,630
Today,

454
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,260
I encountered

455
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,540
something interesting.

456
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,380
Li Shande from Shanglin Office

457
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,900
blocked my way

458
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,120
in the corridor.

459
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,820
What's interesting

460
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,830
is that he already had approval,

461
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,890
but he risked his life to see me

462
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,050
instead of transporting litchis.

463
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,080
Did a clever mind

464
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,580
instruct him to do so?

465
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,540
I ask for your fair judgment.

466
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,860
I once met Li Shande

467
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,780
at Leyou Garden.

468
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,620
He was being passed around
by various government offices

469
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,580
and couldn't get approval.

470
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,430
I read his petition.

471
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,340
The logic

472
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,060
and arguments are flawless.

473
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,700
I can't find any flaws.

474
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,310
Knowing what he's doing

475
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,070
is also what you hope to achieve,

476
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:18,220
I helped him get the approval.

477
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,580
Back then,

478
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,100
you were very kind to me

479
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,750
and asked me what reward I wanted.

480
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:27,490
I said

481
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,380
I only wanted a chance

482
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,960
to share your burden.

483
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:35,940
Right Chancellor.

484
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,860
It's not a temporary statement.

485
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,260
It's a creed

486
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,560
that I will uphold forever.

487
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,260
I hope more virtuous and talented people

488
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,340
can gather around you

489
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:50,980
to share your burden

490
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,420
and work for you,

491
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,180
so I gave him some advice.

492
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,680
Who knows

493
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,500
this person has long wanted

494
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,020
to get close to you.

495
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,580
I

496
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,020
didn't mention this to you

497
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,511
because I didn't want
to take credit for it.

498
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,660
But he

499
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,570
mentioned your name

500
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,300
and recommended you

501
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,320
to transport litchis with him.

502
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,740
Right Chancellor.

503
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,220
This was Li Shande's own decision.

504
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,660
You trusted me

505
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:44,300
to handle
Noble Consort's birthday banquet.

506
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,700
Procurement is important.

507
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,580
I also have to manage
Chang'an's business

508
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,140
for you.

509
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,780
I don't have the energy

510
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,440
to participate in the litchi transport.

511
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,820
Besides...

512
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,100
Besides, half of the petition

513
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,580
is missing.

514
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,680
You're hesitant to speak.

515
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,500
Are you trying to play tricks with me?

516
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,660
I dare not.

517
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,380
His petition

518
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,220
only mentioned
the transportation method,

519
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:43,260
but not the money-making method.

520
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,140
From the litchi transport's

521
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,100
expenditures along the way,

522
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,100
mobilization of laborers,

523
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,140
to the cooperation from Lingnan's

524
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,500
local authorities,

525
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,740
each

526
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,320
and every aspect

527
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,844
holds opportunities worth exploring.

528
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,060
Especially

529
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,900
if someone establishes

530
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,090
the trade route
from Lingnan to Chang'an,

531
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,740
they will make a lot of money

532
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,755
and see never-ending profit.

533
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:25,780
Attendant Yu.

534
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,060
Yes.

535
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,380
Are these what you see?

536
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,680
I ask for your fair judgment.

537
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,980
I'm loyal...

538
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,260
I'm loyal to you.

539
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,088
Heaven and earth can bear witness to it.

540
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,780
Forget it.

541
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,590
These fresh litchis were meant

542
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,460
for Noble Consort's birthday banquet.

543
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:01,940
Since you

544
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,900
want to take credit for it,

545
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,333
you can have it.

546
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,220
I dare not

547
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,200
reject your order.

548
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,820
All these years,

549
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,360
I never lacked

550
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,580
talented, capable and smart people

551
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,520
around me.

552
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,377
When have I ever lacked them?

553
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,860
But why

554
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:19,620
did they quit so soon?

555
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,300
Why is that?

556
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,740
Smart people

557
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,660
are always indecisive.

558
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,710
Because these smart people

559
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,460
can never remember

560
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:49,133
the wisdom of feigning foolishness.

561
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,580
I...

562
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,700
I'm enlightened.

563
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,350
I'm afraid

564
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,230
no one else in Chang'an

565
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:04,733
dares to bet like this.

566
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,290
For that boldness alone,

567
00:32:06,488 --> 00:32:08,755
Right Chancellor
should give you the big fish.

568
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,420
My courage

569
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,660
is worthless

570
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,460
to Right Chancellor.

571
00:32:18,466 --> 00:32:20,977
The only things
that can impress Right Chancellor

572
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,822
are real gold and real silver.

573
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,180
My only leverage

574
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,980
today

575
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,780
is to open up

576
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,620
this lucrative path for him.

577
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,220
And that foolish Li Shande

578
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,790
thought he could
win Right Chancellor's favor

579
00:32:40,844 --> 00:32:42,555
with just a few numbers on the petition.

580
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:45,711
Li Shande is stupid,

581
00:32:45,866 --> 00:32:47,340
but he has real talent and knowledge.

582
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,100
Working with him

583
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,740
can save me a lot of trouble.

584
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:57,900
Speaking of,

585
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,140
what is he busy with today?

586
00:33:01,755 --> 00:33:04,200
I heard he gathered
people from various government offices

587
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,288
to discuss the litchi transport
in detail at Shanglin Office tomorrow.

588
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,940
Since he helped me set up the stage,

589
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,540
I'll

590
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,110
play along

591
00:33:23,955 --> 00:33:25,460
and help him put on a good show.

592
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,960
(Shanglin Office)

593
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,700
Let Mr. Li go first!

594
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,100
- Mr. Li.
- Mr. Li.

595
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:14,600
- Mr. Li.
- Mr. Li.

596
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,660
- Mr. Li.
- Mr. Li.

597
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,860
Liangyuan.

598
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:21,044
I heard that yesterday you...

599
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,060
No time for small talk.

600
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,020
Let's discuss business.

601
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,940
Mr. Li, go first.

602
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,220
Please.

603
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,860
Alright.

604
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,810
There are many waterways in Tanzhou.

605
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,170
The roads are often muddy.

606
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,860
We can dispatch laborers in advance

607
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,260
to prepare some hay, lime, and so on

608
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,660
to pave and harden the road.

609
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,380
This way, the path
will be smooth and unobstructed.

610
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,780
My hometown is Hengzhou,

611
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,260
which is on the north side of Mei Pass.

612
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,650
There are many rugged slopes here.

613
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:57,490
I suggest

614
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,030
switching to mules.

615
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,740
Mules are good at climbing.

616
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:01,740
They seem slow,

617
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,080
but they outrun

618
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,360
even the finest steeds.

619
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,820
Dayu Ridge seems to be
a winding mountain road.

620
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,380
We can hire

621
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,300
local agile slaves from Linyi

622
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,380
to carry the jars and travel ahead.

623
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,020
Let the riders wait at the mountain pass
in advance

624
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,380
can save a lot of time.

625
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,280
Good idea.

626
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,460
Resting on the way

627
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,500
will waste a lot of time.

628
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,420
We should set up temporary post stations
for the litchi transport.

629
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,440
Switching every 30 km

630
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,430
will preserve the horses' peak strength.

631
00:35:28,622 --> 00:35:29,844
Adapt it to local conditions.

632
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,740
Record this for me.

633
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,700
Everyone.

634
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,540
This road is more than 2500 km.

635
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,900
There will be countless checkpoints.

636
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,890
We should make a special pass.

637
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,920
This way, we can tell at a glance

638
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,410
that it's the litchi transport team.

639
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:42,870
Good!

640
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,910
This is a good point!

641
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,640
We can paint this pass

642
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,720
green

643
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,100
and notify each checkpoint in advance

644
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,180
to let us pass
when they see a green pass.

645
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,890
- Yes.
- Good idea.

646
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,420
With the priority passage in place,

647
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,160
we'll save more than half a day.

648
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,400
The official seal of endorsement

649
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,530
can also be kept simple.

650
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,130
We can prepare a seal

651
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,610
for the litchi relay

652
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:07,060
to stamp the documents.

653
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,580
Record it.

654
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,460
Bravo.

655
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,933
You're already deep in discussion.

656
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,120
Am I late

657
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,540
today?

658
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,900
- Attendant Yu.
- Attendant Yu.

659
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,060
Has Right Chancellor

660
00:36:25,422 --> 00:36:26,822
approved you to be an inspector?

661
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:29,980
Thank you for your concern.

662
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,320
I will be

663
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,500
working with you this time.

664
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,220
When I was in trouble,

665
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,420
you lent me a helping hand.

666
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,220
I will never forget that.

667
00:36:41,755 --> 00:36:42,920
I can't thank you enough.

668
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,380
I hope I can get this done

669
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,660
with Inspector Yu.

670
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,120
Yes.

671
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,840
Everyone.

672
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,030
Please take a seat.

673
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,340
You came just in time.

674
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,620
Everyone is contributing ideas.

675
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,900
You have experience

676
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,740
in transport.

677
00:37:18,355 --> 00:37:20,155
Your guidance will be much appreciated.

678
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,900
I'm only the inspector this time.

679
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,380
Just offer help if you need me.

680
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,210
Mr. Li has worked hard
for more than a month

681
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,980
since returning from Lingnan.

682
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,400
He gained considerable insight

683
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,670
into the litchi transport.

684
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,550
Everyone.

685
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,380
Just follow

686
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,620
Mr. Li's instructions.

687
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,220
Ignore me.

688
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,140
Go on.

689
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,410
When I was...

690
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,750
When I was in the same class

691
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:09,730
with Mr. Li,

692
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,970
Mr. Li was a top student in mathematics.

693
00:38:13,977 --> 00:38:15,400
Passing the mathematics exam

694
00:38:15,422 --> 00:38:16,420
is the pinnacle

695
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,460
of other people's lives,

696
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,755
but it's also the starting point
of Mr. Li's life.

697
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:24,100
Mr. Li has now reached new heights.

698
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,400
I believe

699
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,830
the litchi transport

700
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,460
will achieve

701
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,340
greater success

702
00:38:32,622 --> 00:38:34,622
under Inspector Yu's leadership.

703
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,580
Everyone.

704
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,730
To us seasoned officials,

705
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,820
actions speak louder than words.

706
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,040
You can tell after a few glances.

707
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,380
I'm impressed

708
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,780
with Mr. Li's

709
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:59,200
way of doing things.

710
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,940
Mr. Li is good at devising strategies

711
00:39:02,022 --> 00:39:03,555
and possesses exceptional intelligence.

712
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,940
Coming up with this method

713
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,470
is admirable and impressive.

714
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,690
Yes.

715
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,490
I was just about to say

716
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,960
that Mr. Li opened up

717
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,000
a relay route for the litchi transport.

718
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:17,660
I can't even imagine

719
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:20,300
how Mr. Li racked his brains

720
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,810
to find a new way

721
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,410
to mobilize so many resources.

722
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,990
This isn't a simple post route.

723
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,470
This is a post route

724
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,810
paved with Mr. Li's blood and sweat.

725
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,070
I suggest

726
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,600
we name this road

727
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,900
after Mr. Li.

728
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,460
Good idea.

729
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,980
Just say any questions you have.

730
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,360
I welcome any suggestions

731
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,200
or additions too.

732
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,220
Forget about flattering me.

733
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,590
Alright, since there's no problem,

734
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,320
I will arrange the specific task

735
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,460
for everyone.

736
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,340
Here

737
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,780
are some blank official documents.

738
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,460
Carriage Bureau.

739
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,310
You're responsible for dispatching

740
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,930
many imperial riders

741
00:40:12,955 --> 00:40:15,600
and communicating with the water
and land stations along the way.

742
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:16,340
Yes.

743
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,320
Imperial Stables Bureau.

744
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,222
Oversee all pasture bureaus
across the country

745
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,380
and dispatch horses nearby

746
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,500
at various post stations.

747
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:23,260
Yes.

748
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:24,060
Ministry of Revenue.

749
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,355
You're in charge of coordinating
with local governments

750
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,380
and deploying
corvée and unranked officials.

751
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,060
Yes.

752
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:30,140
Imperial Household Department.

753
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,330
We're responsible for money,
food supply, and horse equipment.

754
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,170
Good.

755
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,180
- We...
- But...

756
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,140
But?

757
00:40:38,488 --> 00:40:39,460
Shanglin Office

758
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,844
is responsible for transporting ice.

759
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,880
Yes.

760
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,500
Any objections?

761
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:45,460
No.

762
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,420
- No.
- No.

763
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:48,630
No.

764
00:40:49,066 --> 00:40:50,660
Is there no objection to the cost?

765
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,560
The cost this time

766
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,020
will be a bit more than the budget.

767
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,200
Mr. Li

768
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,260
used to be a member of Shanglin Office.

769
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,820
Shanglin Office

770
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,540
will certainly help him

771
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,500
with his task.

772
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:15,180
Deduct the cost

773
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,950
of this ice transport

774
00:41:17,622 --> 00:41:18,660
from our account.

775
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,740
Yes.

776
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,700
You can also deduct it from our account.

777
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,430
You can also advance from our account.

778
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,830
You can also deduct it

779
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,800
from our account.

780
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,120
You can also advance from our account.

781
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,844
Left Storage Office will do the same.

782
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,950
In that case,

783
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:38,540
please go back and prepare.

784
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,250
Everything must be ready
before the 19th day of May.

785
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:44,940
- Yes.
- Yes.

786
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,220
That's all for today.

787
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:51,950
Liangyuan.

788
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,310
These are the strategic arrangements

789
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:57,020
and notes I recorded.

790
00:41:57,555 --> 00:41:59,511
See if there's anything else
you like to add.

791
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,180
Inspector Yu, here.

792
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,460
Take a look.

793
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:16,820
No thanks.

794
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,860
We'll follow your instructions

795
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,300
for the transport preparations.

796
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,140
I'll bid farewell for today.

797
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,380
=The Litchi Road=

798
00:42:35,466 --> 00:42:37,340
Overspending
is a sign of poor performance.

799
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,244
Having a surplus
is the result of effective planning.

800
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,300
I think

801
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,644
you should double it.

802
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,780
You're indeed more experienced.

803
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,630
The 1st day of June is coming.

804
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,370
We must set off
on the 19th day of May!

805
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,580
Please gather all the officials

806
00:42:52,644 --> 00:42:54,244
to make arrangements in advance.

807
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,660
I will eat him alive.

808
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,220
Attendant Yu?

809
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,260
I recommended him.

810
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,266
You said that if more people help me,

811
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,340
I will be closer to success.

812
00:43:04,533 --> 00:43:05,866
When you're closer to success,

813
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,240
I'm not far from death!
