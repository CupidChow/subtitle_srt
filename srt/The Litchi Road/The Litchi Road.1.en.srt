=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,511
Who put up this canopy?

3
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:46,866
It's so sloppy that it ends up
crushing the flowers.

4
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,519
This old peony

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,239
already had weak roots

6
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:51,244
and short branches.

7
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:55,155
(Li Shande, Shanglin Office Supervisor)
It barely made it through the winter.

8
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,959
Now it suffers this disaster.

9
00:01:57,244 --> 00:01:59,111
Fortunately, the main stem is unharmed.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,359
Fix it in place with wooden slats,

11
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,400
cover the wound with yellow clay,

12
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:06,200
and it should survive.

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,879
The only thing is its blooming
will be delayed.

14
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,666
It's injured, after all.

15
00:02:11,777 --> 00:02:12,822
Needs time to recover.

16
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,622
The Right Chancellor said

17
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,560
this old peony

18
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,822
is His Majesty's favorite.

19
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,000
It has to bloom on time.

20
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,319
Peonies are viewed on the third day
after Grain Rain.

21
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,080
From today...

22
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:29,644
we still have time.

23
00:02:30,044 --> 00:02:31,066
It is still possible.

24
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,940
=Episode 1=

25
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,820
(Second Month,
13th year of Tianbao, Chang'an)

26
00:02:58,266 --> 00:02:59,911
(Right Chancellor)
Right Chancellor.

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,240
Do not bother me

28
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,800
with such trivial matters.

29
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,280
Let the Bureau of Agriculture
handle it.

30
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:24,879
Understood.

31
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,569
(Bureau of Agriculture)
An imperial order

32
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,444
for the Bureau of Agriculture.

33
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,980
(Bureau of Agriculture)

34
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,879
Quickly.

35
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:35,400
Deliver it to the Shanglin Office.

36
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,844
It must be delivered
before the end of the shift!

37
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,740
(Shanglin Office)

38
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,039
(Chief Liu, Shanglin Office)

39
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:52,680
Chief Liu.

40
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:54,879
Chief Liu.

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,520
Chief Liu.

42
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,955
This...

43
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,439
This is ridiculous!

44
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,000
Litchis?

45
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,000
This...

46
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,280
I...

47
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,422
Anyone who takes on this job
is as good as dead!

48
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,244
Watch your words.

49
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,777
This directive has been passed

50
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,600
all around the inner court,

51
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,040
and it ended up here
at the Shanglin Office.

52
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,959
There's no one else for it to go to.

53
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,600
Even if transporting fresh litchis
from Lingnan to Chang'an

54
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,720
is a death sentence,

55
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,688
someone still has to do it.

56
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,000
You.

57
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,360
Yes, you.

58
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,160
Sir.

59
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,839
You know me too well.

60
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,639
I'm only good at handling personnel.

61
00:05:05,977 --> 00:05:08,155
I don't know
a thing about flowers or trees.

62
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,869
I can't even keep the willows

63
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,977
by the lake alive.

64
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,839
How could I possibly take on
something this important, Sir?

65
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,319
You.

66
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,160
You.

67
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,360
Sir.

68
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:19,480
Sir.

69
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:20,920
Sir.

70
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm good at procurement,

71
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:25,711
but I'm already burdened
with big responsibilities.

72
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,066
Don't you remember?

73
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,160
You're busy with official duties.

74
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,600
All your household affairs

75
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,000
fall to me.

76
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,040
I must stay

77
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,519
and ease your burden.

78
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,160
You, then.

79
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,079
Chief Liu.

80
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,439
I'm tasked with escorting

81
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,399
the imperial shipment of oranges
from Shu.

82
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,920
I'm afraid

83
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,600
I simply do not have
the time or strength.

84
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,519
Sir!

85
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:50,511
My elder brother may work
at the Ministry of Personnel,

86
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,040
but he always reminds me

87
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:55,888
never to abuse one's authority.

88
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,270
For such an important assignment,

89
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,759
I would never fight for it.

90
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,720
Never.

91
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,399
Sir.

92
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,720
My constitution fears humidity and heat.

93
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,240
In the south,

94
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,480
my whole body breaks out
in rashes and sores.

95
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,399
I can endure hardship,

96
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,399
but

97
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,560
I would never risk
delaying His Majesty's affairs.

98
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,560
Absolutely not.

99
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Never.

100
00:06:23,822 --> 00:06:25,688
- Chief Liu.
- Chief Liu.

101
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,666
All of you are refusing to go.

102
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,079
Are you suggesting I go myself?

103
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:32,777
- We wouldn't dare.
- We wouldn't dare.

104
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,800
Sir.

105
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:35,800
Look.

106
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:37,879
One of us

107
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,439
isn't here, is he?

108
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,519
- Yes.
- Yes.

109
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,439
Li Shande?

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,377
Mr. Li.

111
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:07,720
Gou'er.

112
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,720
Is your master awake yet?

113
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:10,839
He is.

114
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,266
Please wait here a moment.

115
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:22,755
Ping'an.

116
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:23,240
Ping'an...

117
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,439
Ping'an!

118
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:27,830
Are you a rooster or something?

119
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,279
Out here crowing at my door so early.

120
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,120
Well, you're born under the bird sign.

121
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:33,266
Fly out, and you vanish.

122
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,488
Never home, never sleeping.

123
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,000
Xiu'er! Come here.

124
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,079
Uncle.

125
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:38,839
Xiu'er.

126
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:39,639
You're here.

127
00:07:40,622 --> 00:07:41,977
Have you had your morning meal?

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,466
Not yet.

129
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,279
Not yet?

130
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,319
Well...

131
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,000
She just said she was hungry.

132
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,319
Go on.

133
00:07:50,622 --> 00:07:51,644
Buy yourself some hubing.

134
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,377
Get going.

135
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,333
Thank you, Uncle!

136
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,319
Don't go too far!

137
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,519
You dote on her.

138
00:07:59,079 --> 00:07:59,519
Come on.

139
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,189
(Zheng Ping'an,
Assistant Minister of Entertainment)

140
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,888
Did you take a look at that house?

141
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,480
I did.

142
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
Well,

143
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,577
it's my own house.
I hardly need a second look.

144
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,639
"Your" house?

145
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,360
That was from my sister's dowry.

146
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,199
We sold it to buy medicine

147
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,800
for her.

148
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,919
Yet, we couldn't save her in the end.

149
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:39,111
Xiu'er's been suffering
these past years,

150
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,799
following you around,

151
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:42,320
living in rented accommodation.

152
00:08:43,977 --> 00:08:45,555
Now someone's willing to sell it back.

153
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,444
Just buy it already.

154
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,279
I know.

155
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,320
I never said I wouldn't.

156
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:52,600
What price did you manage
to talk them down to?

157
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,622
That intermediary didn't know

158
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,039
it used to be mine.

159
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,679
So, I pointed out

160
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,559
all its flaws.

161
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,360
The rafters are full of wormholes.

162
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,080
Patched up with lime,

163
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,629
and varnished over.

164
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,630
And these beams. See here?

165
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,840
They're all joined in the back.

166
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,488
They broke.

167
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:07,320
He got nervous.

168
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,600
In the end,

169
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,120
I drove it down to 300 guan.

170
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,279
The same price

171
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,519
I sold it for back then.

172
00:09:12,688 --> 00:09:14,120
Then, there's no reason to hesitate.

173
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,644
Not only will it fulfill your wish,

174
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,130
but it'll go up in value over time.

175
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,755
A chance like this doesn't come twice.

176
00:09:18,777 --> 00:09:20,000
You're right.

177
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,279
I really should act quickly.

178
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:23,399
It's just...

179
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm a bit short.

180
00:09:27,177 --> 00:09:28,030
How much short?

181
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,120
I've got 130 guan.

182
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,799
The asking price is 300.

183
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,360
You have 130.

184
00:09:38,466 --> 00:09:38,977
Get lost.

185
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,759
Ping'an.

186
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,519
Ping'an...

187
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,399
You call that "a bit short"?

188
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,159
You're utterly coinless!

189
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,240
Li Shande.

190
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,590
You've been an official in Chang'an
for over a decade.

191
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,066
Your rank never rises,

192
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,759
and your salary never lasts.

193
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,266
You spend all your time
fussing over plants and flowers.

194
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,559
Do flowers grow gold?

195
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,960
Do grasses sprout silver?

196
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,159
You need to flatter your superiors.

197
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,320
Drink with your colleagues.

198
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,240
That's how you...

199
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,399
I don't know

200
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,559
how to play your game.

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,759
Mr. He.

202
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,080
Staff Officer Pang.

203
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,639
How thoughtful of you.

204
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:18,000
What's that supposed to mean?

205
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,440
If you think so little of me,
why are you still here?

206
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:20,840
Well,

207
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,200
even if I could swallow my pride,

208
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,639
I still can't

209
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,466
pull the money together right away.

210
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,720
Never mind.

211
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:31,644
Get back here.

212
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,799
I told you.

213
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,259
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

214
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:36,759
Yes.

215
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,799
Fine.

216
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,080
Go to Pingkang Ward

217
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,288
and find Madam Shiqi.

218
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,440
I'll vouch for you.

219
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:44,933
Get a loan from her.

220
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,549
You'll be my guarantor?

221
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,244
That's perfect!

222
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,679
The house is 300 guan.

223
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,919
By market standards,

224
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,519
I can

225
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,600
borrow 150.

226
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,422
That leaves 20 guan...

227
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,879
Scrape it together

228
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,133
from your friends and family.

229
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,000
You know how things are
with us and our...

230
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,279
Right?

231
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,679
I guarantee your loan,

232
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,200
I lend you money,

233
00:11:14,711 --> 00:11:16,030
and the house is in your name.

234
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:17,000
What? Every good thing

235
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,600
must land

236
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,720
in your lap?

237
00:11:18,822 --> 00:11:20,933
Do you think the Zheng family
owes you something?

238
00:11:21,511 --> 00:11:23,560
If my sister's family
hadn't fallen on hard times,

239
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,377
she would never have married you!

240
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,440
Look. Xiu'er's back.

241
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,840
You're back.

242
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,120
We're back!

243
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,879
Was it good, Xiu'er?

244
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:36,720
Yes!

245
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,600
You want one too?

246
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,577
Take this, Xiu'er.

247
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:45,440
Take it.

248
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:48,559
Eat up.

249
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,088
All right.

250
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,039
Your uncle spoils you.

251
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,600
Come on...

252
00:11:54,955 --> 00:11:56,733
I'm only doing this for Xiu'er.

253
00:12:06,177 --> 00:12:07,120
Thank you, Ping'an.

254
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,039
Thank you.

255
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:11,360
Um,

256
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,799
I also prepared

257
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,177
a loan receipt.

258
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,039
Two copies.

259
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,279
Take it.

260
00:12:18,222 --> 00:12:18,750
All right.

261
00:12:18,866 --> 00:12:20,400
Xiu'er and I will be off, then.

262
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:21,510
Say goodbye to your uncle.

263
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,159
Goodbye, Uncle.

264
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:22,799
Goodbye.

265
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,133
Go back inside.

266
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,422
(Borrower: Li Shande
Guarantor: Liu Debao)

267
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,919
When did he write this?

268
00:12:44,777 --> 00:12:46,533
How did he know I would agree to help?

269
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,120
Li Shande!

270
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:58,422
I gave you the money, didn't I?

271
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,022
What more do you want?

272
00:13:01,422 --> 00:13:02,266
Get lost!

273
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,840
Is this the residence of Mr. Zheng?

274
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:09,519
Yes.

275
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,799
Mr. Lu.

276
00:13:19,044 --> 00:13:20,666
(Lu Huan,
Deputy Director, Security Bureau)

277
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,140
(Xingyang Branch)

278
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,399
I remember

279
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,519
your other siblings

280
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,644
have all passed.

281
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,200
Among the Zhengs of Xingyang
in Chang'an,

282
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,960
your father's line

283
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,088
only has you left, right?

284
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:46,440
Yes.

285
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,500
If I may be of assistance,
Deputy Director Lu,

286
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,639
I am yours to command.

287
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:53,399
I will do

288
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,159
my best.

289
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,155
Quick-witted.

290
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,679
He might not be very sociable,

291
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,000
but he is a capable worker.

292
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,820
(15 guan)

293
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,580
(8 guan)

294
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,759
Li Shande may have saved

295
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:22,159
those flowers and saplings,

296
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,519
but he also ruined our excuse

297
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,480
for future procurement.

298
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,120
He's turned Shanglin Office

299
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,240
into a pool

300
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,080
- of stagnant water.
- That's right.

301
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,279
Chief Liu, have you considered this?

302
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:34,679
Without him, yes,

303
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,039
no one else can do the work he does.

304
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:39,080
But without him,

305
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,519
we also would not have
so much work to do.

306
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,879
(12 guan)

307
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:51,320
Four, five...

308
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,159
Four...

309
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:57,960
20.

310
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,279
The money is finally all there.

311
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,200
(Spirit tablet of beloved wife,
Zheng Jinniang of Xingyang)

312
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,279
Xiu'er and I can move back

313
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:17,120
into our old house.

314
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,120
The osmanthus tree you planted
in the courtyard

315
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,000
has withered.

316
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,600
But that's all right.

317
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,066
I will plant another.

318
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,759
By August,

319
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,200
the scent will still fill the yard.

320
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,444
I'll take care of it myself.

321
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,320
Just like how you used

322
00:15:39,311 --> 00:15:41,377
to always be there for the two of us.

323
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,279
From now on,

324
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,600
we'll be by your side every day too.

325
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,733
(Spirit tablet of beloved wife,
Zheng Jinniang of Xingyang)

326
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,200
Move out!

327
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,639
25 guan, weight checked.

328
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,159
Madam Shiqi.

329
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,600
A total of 150 guan, all accounted for.

330
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,733
Madam Shiqi.

331
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,260
(Madam Shiqi)

332
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,680
In the capital, aside from
the two licensed moneylender markets,

333
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,640
my place is the fastest

334
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,559
when it comes to loans.

335
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,640
However, my money comes

336
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,720
from my patrons.

337
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,279
They trust me,

338
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:30,640
and I have to give them

339
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,759
that peace of mind.

340
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,799
I only lend to those

341
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:34,960
I know well and trust.

342
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,960
This time,

343
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,039
I only agreed to your loan

344
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,133
because of Mr. Zheng.

345
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:45,319
I grew up here in Pingkang Ward.

346
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:48,680
I may be skilled
in music and performance,

347
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:51,022
but when it comes
to reading and numbers,

348
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:52,839
I'm awfully clueless.

349
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,270
So, this novice monk will assist me.

350
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,400
Please.

351
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:57,319
Thank you.

352
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:03,039
Here.

353
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:03,720
Mr. Li.

354
00:18:06,022 --> 00:18:07,400
As a monk, I want nothing to do

355
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,759
with the stench of money.

356
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:11,000
So, I shall call this loan's principal

357
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,039
"merit,"

358
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,240
and the interest "blessing."

359
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,920
The contract

360
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,319
says 150 guan,

361
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:24,519
with a monthly "blessing rate" of 4%.

362
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,880
Due in two years.

363
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,279
So,

364
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,319
the total with interest

365
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,720
should be 294 guan.

366
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,039
Why does it say

367
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,880
328 and a half guan?

368
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,711
That's too much.

369
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:37,880
This just shows how deep your merit is,

370
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,888
and how long your blessings will last.

371
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:41,920
But according to the laws of Tang,

372
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,377
loans must be calculated

373
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:44,960
only on the principal.

374
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:46,990
You can't turn interest
into a new principal.

375
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,759
Isn't your "blessing"

376
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,480
accounting

377
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,839
a little off?

378
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,960
You're clever at calculations.

379
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,200
But do you really think

380
00:19:00,377 --> 00:19:03,000
your quick thinking can beat
our many hours of careful math?

381
00:19:03,111 --> 00:19:05,450
I entered official service
through the mathematics division

382
00:19:05,466 --> 00:19:06,440
in the Kaiyuan era.

383
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,377
I don't miscalculate.

384
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,960
You must've been the top scorer.

385
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,519
I never imagined

386
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,400
Mr. Zheng's brother-in-law

387
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,640
would be such a talent.

388
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:20,350
I could tell you were special

389
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:23,079
the moment you walked in.

390
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:24,270
Let's talk business.

391
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:24,559
You...

392
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,688
Let's talk business.

393
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,279
Likely a clerical error by a servant.

394
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,559
We'll correct it.

395
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:35,311
Change the amount on the yellow slip.

396
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,940
(Li Shande)

397
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,839
Well then, congratulations, Mr. Li.

398
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:46,270
You shall have a fine new home

399
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,599
in the capital.

400
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:51,480
He bought a house?

401
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,311
He's usually such a miser.

402
00:19:53,311 --> 00:19:55,350
Always going on about how poor he is.

403
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:56,640
Didn't expect

404
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,400
that old mule to get down
to serious work.

405
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,440
He even bought a house.

406
00:20:04,577 --> 00:20:05,200
Give me that.

407
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,200
His Majesty has issued a decree.

408
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,160
- Sir.
- Sir.

409
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:14,755
This is an honor
for the Shanglin Office.

410
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,519
We must treat it with the seriousness

411
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,240
it deserves.

412
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,200
We must select the most capable talent.

413
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,440
Do any of you

414
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,319
have recommendations?

415
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
- We
- We

416
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:29,960
- do.
- do.

417
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,079
- Mr. Li.
- Mr. Li.

418
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:40,830
- Mr. Li.
- Mr. Li.

419
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,260
(Shanglin Office)

420
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,880
There he is.

421
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,119
Here he comes.

422
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:54,759
Mr. Li.

423
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,200
Liangyuan.

424
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,240
Come here.

425
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:03,555
I need to talk to you.

426
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:04,759
Come here.

427
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,359
Come.

428
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:05,799
Join us.

429
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:06,309
No, thanks.

430
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,990
I'll pick up my daughter
from the academy.

431
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,440
Come on.

432
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:09,160
Join us.

433
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,359
Join us, Mr. Li.

434
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:10,799
Come on.

435
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,269
Come on.

436
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,000
No, I can't...

437
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:14,640
Come.

438
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,266
I need to prepare dinner for her...

439
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:17,400
Come on.

440
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,640
I need to talk to you.

441
00:21:19,355 --> 00:21:20,644
Sit down, Mr. Li.

442
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:27,920
Do...

443
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,039
Do I sit here?

444
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:30,119
Yes, sit.

445
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,640
- Sit down and eat with us.
- Come on. Sit.

446
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,839
Thank you, Sir.

447
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,359
Here.

448
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,160
A toast.

449
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,088
All right.

450
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,119
Here.

451
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,359
I...

452
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,111
Liangyuan.

453
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,720
Eat.

454
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,480
We'll discuss this matter over the meal.

455
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,240
Eat up.

456
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,480
Here.

457
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,000
Try this.

458
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,200
How is it?

459
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,720
Tender.

460
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,759
Here.

461
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:35,759
Mr. Li.

462
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,111
You're known to be quite the scholar.

463
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,200
Enlighten us.

464
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,200
Tell us.

465
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,822
What exactly is a litchi?

466
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,839
The litchi is a fruit

467
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,039
with a vermilion scaly skin

468
00:22:57,133 --> 00:22:58,459
and flesh-like solidified cream.

469
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,120
It originates in Lingnan, though it also
grows in parts of central Shu.

470
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,200
It ripens fully around May.

471
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,559
They say the flavor is exquisite,

472
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,319
but

473
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:06,720
extremely perishable.

474
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,729
Very hard to preserve.

475
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,459
The saying goes,
"Day one, the color changes.

476
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,888
Day two, the fragrance fades.
Day three, the taste is gone."

477
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:13,680
I myself have never tasted one.

478
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,933
Liangyuan is knowledgeable indeed.

479
00:23:15,955 --> 00:23:16,830
Here.

480
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,799
Here.

481
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:23,839
Liangyuan.

482
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,720
By your account,

483
00:23:26,511 --> 00:23:28,750
does that mean
we have no chance of tasting litchis

484
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:29,559
in Chang'an?

485
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:32,070
During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han,

486
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,160
the Fuli Palace was built

487
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:34,920
in Chang'an.

488
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,880
Various exotic plants were cultivated.

489
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:37,960
Among them

490
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,000
was the litchi tree.

491
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,822
Alas, due to the vast difference
in climate between north and south,

492
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,311
the tree struggled to adapt
and ultimately did not survive.

493
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,480
If someone really wants to eat litchis,

494
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:49,480
what can be done?

495
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:50,350
Simple.

496
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:52,640
Take the flesh, soak it in honey,

497
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:53,720
and make candied litchis.

498
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,599
We call that litchi preserves.

499
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,200
That said,

500
00:23:58,377 --> 00:23:59,790
the taste of preserved litchis

501
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,222
is far inferior to the fresh ones.

502
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:01,920
Still,

503
00:24:01,977 --> 00:24:02,880
better than nothing.

504
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:04,480
Excellent!

505
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,160
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

506
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,554
As expected of Liangyuan.

507
00:24:08,555 --> 00:24:09,644
Knowledgeable and eloquent.

508
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:10,750
Indeed.

509
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,599
Liangyuan,

510
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,466
fortune favors you.

511
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,559
The Shanglin Office

512
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,759
has received a task.

513
00:24:21,266 --> 00:24:23,133
Everyone unanimously recommended you.

514
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:24,440
I had

515
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,200
my reservations,

516
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:28,177
but after hearing what you said earlier,

517
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,079
it feels like

518
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,400
this job was made for you.

519
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,400
What task?

520
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,000
Oh, nothing major.

521
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,680
The palace needs to procure

522
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,319
some litchi...

523
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,039
Preserves.

524
00:24:42,488 --> 00:24:44,044
And you're the perfect man

525
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:46,319
for the job.

526
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,039
Me?

527
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,119
You were out just now,

528
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,599
but we discussed it

529
00:25:00,688 --> 00:25:02,400
and agreed you're mature and reliable.

530
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,720
The best fit for this assignment.

531
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:06,599
That's right.

532
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,160
Look.

533
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,680
In recent years,

534
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,839
His Majesty often sends people
on these ad hoc errands.

535
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,160
Technically,

536
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,066
these assignments are not
formal appointments,

537
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,000
but you're serving His Majesty directly.

538
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,799
So,

539
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,880
everyone takes them very seriously.

540
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:30,319
And the rewards?

541
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,119
Too many to list.

542
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,440
I heard you just bought a house.

543
00:25:37,822 --> 00:25:39,088
Complete this assignment well,

544
00:25:39,088 --> 00:25:40,350
and you'll surely be rewarded.

545
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,133
No need to worry
about repaying your loan.

546
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:44,720
Congratulations.

547
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,888
A celebration is in order.

548
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,319
Congratulations.

549
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:48,880
So,

550
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,160
you're all

551
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,266
really naming me Litchi Envoy?

552
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,160
His Majesty left the name blank

553
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,933
for recommendations from the bureaus.

554
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,240
So,

555
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,359
finish your cup,

556
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:05,160
and I'll put your name forward.

557
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,266
You hold your liquor well.

558
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,160
Registrar.

559
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:24,511
Bring the brush and ink.

560
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:25,359
Yes, sir.

561
00:26:44,444 --> 00:26:45,733
As per the imperial decree,

562
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,240
we nominate

563
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,480
Li Shande,

564
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,000
Supervisor,

565
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,519
to oversee this assignment.

566
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:03,955
All right.

567
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:05,519
Here you go.

568
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:11,200
Take it.

569
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,180
(Li Shande, Litchi Envoy)

570
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,400
Make three copies.

571
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,799
Stamp them

572
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,110
with the Shanglin Office seal.

573
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,830
Send one each
to the Bureau of Agriculture,

574
00:27:44,866 --> 00:27:45,890
the Ministry of Personnel,

575
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,319
and the Censorate to be recorded.

576
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,039
Yes, sir.

577
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,319
- Congratulations, Envoy Li.
- Congratulations, Envoy Li.

578
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
From this moment on,

579
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:59,440
Li Shande
is the officially appointed Litchi Envoy

580
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:01,880
by His Majesty.

581
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,319
All right.

582
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,720
Here, here.

583
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:05,680
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, Envoy Li.

584
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,880
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

585
00:28:15,577 --> 00:28:18,700
(Pingkang Ward)

586
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:20,599
Mr. Zheng.

587
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,840
Mr. Zheng, which master
will you be seeing?

588
00:28:22,844 --> 00:28:23,310
No need.

589
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,533
Mr. Zheng.

590
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,200
(The Security Bureau
just received word.)

591
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,319
(Inspector He Youguang of Gaozhou)

592
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,880
has sent an emissary

593
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,079
named Pan Bao,

594
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:00,400
bringing a large shipment
of Lingnan jewels to Chang'an.

595
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,720
We suspect

596
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,799
this is a bribe

597
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:06,279
for the Right Chancellor.

598
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,599
My guess is,

599
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
he wants the court to issue him

600
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,377
a Lingnan military tally.

601
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:17,880
(If you can gather evidence)

602
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:19,599
(that the Right Chancellor)

603
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,960
(is colluding with He Youguang,)

604
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:26,160
(the Left Chancellor will have
what he needs to bring him down.)

605
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,559
(If the Security Bureau stepped in,)

606
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,079
(it would alert them.)

607
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,759
(What you need)

608
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,039
(is someone clever,)

609
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,599
(someone who can snoop around)

610
00:29:35,777 --> 00:29:37,030
(without raising suspicion.)

611
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:41,359
Clever.

612
00:29:42,088 --> 00:29:43,160
(The Left Chancellor said)

613
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,920
(if this succeeds...)

614
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:46,680
He will help you return

615
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,920
to the Zheng clan.

616
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:03,279
Mr. Zheng.

617
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,000
Mr. Lin.

618
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,240
A fine jug of wine for this room.

619
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,279
I'll be right back.

620
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,359
I'll be right back.

621
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,119
Be right back.

622
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,488
- Let me see who's in this room.
- Please keep off.

623
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,559
I am the Assistant Minister
of Entertainment.

624
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:25,400
Ask around.

625
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,000
There is no room in Chang'an
that I cannot enter.

626
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:33,177
You've got the wrong one.

627
00:30:34,022 --> 00:30:34,640
This is not it.

628
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,160
Not this one?

629
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,000
Next door.

630
00:30:41,977 --> 00:30:43,288
I really did get the wrong room.

631
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:02,219
- Stick, stick, tiger.
- Stick, stick, tiger.

632
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:02,680
Liangyuan.

633
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,170
- Stick, stick, worm.
- Stick, stick, worm.

634
00:31:04,177 --> 00:31:05,500
You should head out early today.

635
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,920
You live in Changshou Ward.

636
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:07,880
It's far.

637
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:09,000
Well,

638
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,000
everyone's still here.

639
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:10,839
I shouldn't leave.

640
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:11,680
Off you go, Liangyuan.

641
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,559
You're Litchi Envoy now.

642
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:15,799
You'll be running errands
for His Majesty.

643
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,155
Don't worry about office matters.

644
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,000
Here you go.

645
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,288
I actually got this opportunity.

646
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,377
Are you really giving this to me?

647
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,680
The name is signed,

648
00:31:28,755 --> 00:31:29,933
and the seals are stamped.

649
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:31,844
What more do you need to believe it?

650
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,880
Pack up and get going.

651
00:31:36,888 --> 00:31:38,600
You still need to pick up your daughter.

652
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:39,920
Yes, Sir.

653
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:42,400
I'll take my leave.

654
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:44,270
- Smooth sailing.
- Smooth sailing.

655
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:58,977
(Remember.)

656
00:31:59,111 --> 00:32:00,511
(You have only one mission.)

657
00:32:01,555 --> 00:32:03,044
(Find out whether they are dealing)

658
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,240
(the Lingnan military tally
in that room.)

659
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,400
(Once confirmed,)

660
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,200
(send word using the code, "fish.")

661
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,480
(Understood.)

662
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,755
(Deputy Director Lu.)

663
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:20,400
I was

664
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,519
never trained in martial arts.

665
00:32:28,955 --> 00:32:30,111
If something goes down,

666
00:32:32,466 --> 00:32:33,977
do have people come get me.

667
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,599
Have you looked over

668
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,359
Inspector He's gift list

669
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,039
for the Right Chancellor?

670
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,279
Yes. Everything matches.

671
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:02,599
City gates closing!

672
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:04,200
Hurry!

673
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:05,799
Watch out!

674
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:07,960
Watch out!

675
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,640
Life is short,
and enjoy it while you can.

676
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,759
Don't let your golden goblet

677
00:33:15,955 --> 00:33:17,533
sit empty beneath the moon.

678
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,759
(Ma Guiyun)
We can't give you

679
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:23,319
what you want from us.

680
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,140
(Pan Bao)

681
00:33:32,466 --> 00:33:34,266
The Right Chancellor has made it clear.

682
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,559
The military tally is too important.

683
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,480
He's asked me to personally travel

684
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:41,200
to Lingnan and hand it over
to Inspector He himself.

685
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,800
It cannot be passed through anyone else.

686
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,200
I am Inspector He's trusted aide.

687
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,400
Does the Right Chancellor not trust me?

688
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,799
I am Ma Guiyun,

689
00:33:49,822 --> 00:33:51,070
Right Chancellor's trusted man.

690
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:53,039
Does Inspector He

691
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,200
not trust me?

692
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,500
(Preserve)

693
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:27,540
(Preserve-Fresh)

694
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:30,880
Sir?

695
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,000
Are you all right?

696
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,320
Could you take a look at this for me?

697
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:42,800
This...

698
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,400
This is "fresh", yes?

699
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,000
I...

700
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,000
He's a fast runner.

701
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,800
When will you depart, Mr. Ma?

702
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:56,840
Tonight.

703
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,239
I dare not delay

704
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,840
the Right Chancellor's orders.

705
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,360
Shame I still have matters
to tend to in Chang'an.

706
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,519
I shan't accompany you.

707
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:09,159
No need to be so polite.

708
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:10,480
I do not need an escort.

709
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:12,639
But there is one thing

710
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,880
you must remember.

711
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,760
Only the Right Chancellor knows

712
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,119
about my trip

713
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:22,000
to Lingnan.

714
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,119
Make way!

715
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:24,880
Make way!

716
00:35:24,977 --> 00:35:25,630
Please make way!

717
00:35:25,955 --> 00:35:26,977
Watch where you're going!

718
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,159
This is a token.

719
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,088
Show this to Inspector He,

720
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,639
and he will know everything.

721
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:12,159
Sir!

722
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,529
- Sir!
- Sir!

723
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,511
- What happened?
- Sir!

724
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:18,200
Sir!

725
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:19,400
What's your problem?

726
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:19,920
Sir.

727
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,066
Sir, you have to help me.

728
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:22,400
You must help me, Sir.

729
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:23,760
Please help me.

730
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:25,920
Are you out of your mind?

731
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,400
The yellow slip in the official document
you gave me came off.

732
00:36:29,488 --> 00:36:31,066
I respectfully request it be re-stamped.

733
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,920
It's not that big of a deal.

734
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:36,280
Why are you this worked up?

735
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,599
Look.

736
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:40,000
Originally,

737
00:36:40,155 --> 00:36:41,749
the word "fresh" was written by mistake,

738
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,909
so it was corrected
with a yellow slip to read "preserve."

739
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,510
But somehow,
that slip of paper fell off.

740
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:46,622
It needs to be reattached.

741
00:36:46,688 --> 00:36:47,710
This is an imperial edict.

742
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,440
It must bear your official seal.

743
00:36:49,511 --> 00:36:52,111
Or else it would be tampering
with His Majesty's command!

744
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:53,800
A yellow slip?

745
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,000
I don't recall there being

746
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,311
any yellow slip on the edict

747
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:59,079
when it was issued to you.

748
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,688
Did you add it yourself?

749
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,440
I wouldn't dare!

750
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,360
I...

751
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,679
You said it yourself.

752
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,679
A yellow slip

753
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,320
needs

754
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:10,559
to be sealed

755
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,079
to prove transparency.

756
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:14,239
If the slip really came off,

757
00:37:14,288 --> 00:37:15,977
where's the imprint of your seal?

758
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:16,599
Right.

759
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,480
Do you see one?

760
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:24,679
I...

761
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:28,239
Sir.

762
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,444
I beg you for clarity.

763
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,960
Just now over the meal,

764
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:31,960
did you not say

765
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,079
the palace wanted litchi preserves?

766
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,320
Litchi preserves?

767
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,880
Have you been drinking too much?

768
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:43,559
The palace has that stuff

769
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,960
by the cartload.

770
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,666
Why would they need us to supply it?

771
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:47,920
Everyone.

772
00:37:48,088 --> 00:37:49,440
Did I ever mention litchi preserves

773
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,920
while we were eating?

774
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,320
- No.
- No.

775
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,360
Never.

776
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,880
The Chief said

777
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:56,440
litchis.

778
00:37:58,119 --> 00:37:58,639
Yes.

779
00:37:58,639 --> 00:37:59,079
Litchis.

780
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:00,599
You were the one who said preserves.

781
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,079
Litchi...

782
00:38:02,288 --> 00:38:02,840
Preserves.

783
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:05,760
The imperial edict is clear.

784
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:06,840
You were

785
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,559
appointed Litchi Envoy specifically

786
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:10,039
to procure fresh litchi

787
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,280
for the palace.

788
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:12,480
You must have misread it.

789
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:13,199
Fresh litchis?

790
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,280
Sir.

791
00:38:14,755 --> 00:38:15,933
You know the nature of litchis.

792
00:38:15,933 --> 00:38:18,090
One day, the color fades.
Two days, the fragrance is gone.

793
00:38:18,111 --> 00:38:19,200
Three days, the taste spoils.

794
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,066
There's no way to get them
back to Chang'an in time,

795
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:22,755
no matter where
they're transported from!

796
00:38:22,777 --> 00:38:25,119
Which is precisely
why you need to think harder.

797
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,480
His Majesty is waiting.

798
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:29,519
Look closely.

799
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:31,039
The edict clearly states

800
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:33,440
His Majesty wants fresh litchis

801
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,466
from Lingnan.

802
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:38,800
Sir!

803
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,119
Sir...

804
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,079
Sir...

805
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:41,960
Lingnan...

806
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:44,039
Lingnan is 2500 km from Chang'an!

807
00:38:44,311 --> 00:38:46,333
Not even a deity
could deliver them in time!

808
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:49,599
Sir...

809
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,977
- End of shift.
- Go home.

810
00:38:52,066 --> 00:38:52,955
Let's go home.

811
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,159
I have an old condition

812
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,555
that prevents me from drinking.

813
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:21,719
I won't be joining you today.

814
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,679
I wish you

815
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,639
safe travels to Lingnan.

816
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:26,880
Thank you.

817
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,110
The gates are closed!

818
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,133
Where are you off to?

819
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,559
Open the archives!

820
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:08,950
I need to check the official record
of an imperial edict!

821
00:40:08,955 --> 00:40:10,222
(Bureau of Agriculture Archives)

822
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,844
What are you doing?

823
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,920
Eavesdropping.

824
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,311
Come in and listen.

825
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,500
(Imperial Litchi Envoy
Appointment Decree)

826
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:46,960
Guards!

827
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,000
Fish!

828
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:50,199
Fish!

829
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,740
(Fresh Litchis)

830
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,100
(Fresh Litchis)

831
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,039
No matter how late it got,

832
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,519
Father would always come pick me up.

833
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:08,760
Do you think

834
00:42:08,911 --> 00:42:10,733
something's happened to Father tonight?

835
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,320
Your father works

836
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:14,800
with flowers and trees.

837
00:42:15,155 --> 00:42:16,955
What trouble could he possibly be in?

838
00:42:17,022 --> 00:42:19,555
He must've gotten pulled
into some urgent assignment.

839
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,320
Xiu'er.

840
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:21,639
Come inside.

841
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,180
=The Litchi Road=

842
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,920
What are you doing?

843
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,000
Qilang!

844
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:37,440
Let go of Gou'er!

845
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,360
Qilang!

846
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:41,119
You shall atone for your death.

847
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,800
If I die,

848
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:46,480
you'll all die with me!

849
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:47,710
If you don't recognize me...

850
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,890
If any one of you dares utter
a single word of defiance,

851
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:51,769
then you're obstructing
an imperial envoy.

852
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,059
And that is punishable by death!

853
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,370
The execution of your entire clan!

854
00:42:54,377 --> 00:42:57,400
I am the Litchi Envoy,
appointed by His Majesty himself!

855
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:04,360
Fight with everything we've got!

856
00:43:06,222 --> 00:43:07,266
How am I going to do this?

857
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,480
