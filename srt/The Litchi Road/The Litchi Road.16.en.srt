00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,999
=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,155 --> 00:01:42,340
(Shanghao House's Veteran Soldier)
Liangyuan.

3
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,590
When I was ten years younger...

4
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,070
(February, Ba Bridge, Chang'an)

5
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,710
I wanted to make a name for myself
in Chang'an

6
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,000
and serve the imperial court.

7
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,430
Unfortunately, I was unlucky.

8
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,755
Whether submitting my writings
or taking the imperial exams,

9
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,920
nothing worked.

10
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,120
By the 10th year of Tianbao,

11
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,760
I still achieved nothing.

12
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,000
On my 40th birthday,

13
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,430
my friend invited me

14
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,088
to sail at Qujiang River to celebrate.

15
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,030
The boat was halfway through

16
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,430
when a thick fog
suddenly rose from the shore.

17
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,870
This scene

18
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,190
instantly threw me into despair.

19
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,910
Isn't this my life?

20
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,840
It's halfway through,

21
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,120
but my future is still uncertain.

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,910
I got off the boat,

23
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,190
feeling utterly lost.

24
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,750
Before I knew it,

25
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,470
I walked to Shanghao House,

26
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,680
500 meters outside Chunming Gate

27
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,430
in the east of the city.

28
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,190
The name

29
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,590
doesn't sound good

30
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,240
and can't even be called a house.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,120
It's just a mass grave.

32
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,800
I

33
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,400
picked a grave

34
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,630
and lay in it.

35
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,311
I don't know how long I lay there.

36
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,030
A veteran soldier

37
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,750
guarding the grave came.

38
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,520
That guy

39
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,680
seemed battered by life,

40
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,470
and one of his eyes was blind.

41
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,560
He lived in seclusion in Shanghao House.

42
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,150
He said

43
00:03:27,888 --> 00:03:29,533
he was guarding the grave

44
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:31,680
of his brother
who was forced to be killed.

45
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,800
He told me

46
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,240
he was forced to join the army

47
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,222
to guard the borders of Western Regions

48
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,190
when he was just as tall as a horse.

49
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,800
It was his first time

50
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,960
leaving his family
and going to the battlefield.

51
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,680
He didn't know when he would die.

52
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,630
One day

53
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,800
on the battlefield,

54
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,840
a brutal enemy

55
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
had him pinned down.

56
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,444
Since he was about to be killed,

57
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,280
he went feral

58
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,590
and ripped off

59
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,910
the enemy's cheek with his teeth.

60
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,622
He managed to strike back
with that move.

61
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,600
Since that battle,

62
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,800
the veteran figured it out.

63
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,480
Since he was in a desperate situation

64
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,711
with no way to retreat,

65
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,750
why not take a step forward

66
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,688
and fight to the death?

67
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,920
Maybe

68
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,000
he could find

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,310
a glimmer of hope.

70
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,480
From that day on,

71
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,160
he practiced swordsmanship and riding.

72
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,240
Whenever the horn rang,

73
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,830
he would rush down from a high place,

74
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,270
bend down and grab the army flag.

75
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,870
With this unyielding spirit,

76
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,680
he survived hundreds of battles,

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,950
returned to Chang'an

78
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,190
from Western Regions,

79
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,430
and became Shadow Chief
of Wannian County.

80
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,510
I was greatly shocked

81
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,270
to hear this.

82
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:03,950
I wonder

83
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,310
how my situation

84
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,160
compares to that of the veteran...

85
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,720
He could strike one blow on fate,

86
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,270
why can't I?

87
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,560
Please.

88
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,660
=Episode 16=

89
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:38,920
Attack!

90
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,040
Retreat!

91
00:05:44,355 --> 00:05:44,888
Retreat!

92
00:05:52,622 --> 00:05:53,160
How are you?

93
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:54,360
Are you alright?

94
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,430
The jar!

95
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,270
Slow down.

96
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,360
The jar.

97
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,070
Be careful.

98
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,444
Lan, go first.

99
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,250
We'll handle this.

100
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,644
Are you alright, Li?

101
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,950
The horse is back!

102
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,770
They're back!

103
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,240
Hold the horse!

104
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,480
Where's Yan?

105
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,800
Yan's behind me.

106
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,022
The horse died on the mountain road.

107
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,800
Hurry!

108
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,310
- Li!
- Hurry. Rest.

109
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,000
- Hurry.
- Get him.

110
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:01,800
Get him!

111
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,370
Rest.

112
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,830
The horses in the stable are exhausted.

113
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,870
None can stand up.

114
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,240
Lift him up!

115
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,830
Hurry. Rest, Li.

116
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,680
Thank you, Li.

117
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,120
What do we do now?

118
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,822
The horses can't run anymore.

119
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,844
We humans can still run.

120
00:07:17,844 --> 00:07:18,720
- Yes.
- Yes.

121
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,830
- I can run too.
- I can run too.

122
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,120
I can run too.

123
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,630
We haven't rested for five days.

124
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,510
Our bodies can't handle

125
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,510
this heavy burden.

126
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,070
Mr. Li.

127
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,070
I usually

128
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:33,488
transport goods in the mountains.

129
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:34,155
I can run!

130
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,560
I can run too!

131
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,120
I've never met

132
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,630
a serious official like you.

133
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,600
These days

134
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,120
have been hard for you.

135
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,160
How about this? I volunteer to help,

136
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,240
but I can't finish the whole journey.

137
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,830
What are you doing?

138
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,920
What are you doing?

139
00:07:56,178 --> 00:07:57,600
What does this have to do with you?

140
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,120
Shut up!

141
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,311
We're doing an experiment!

142
00:07:59,377 --> 00:08:01,510
If you break Mr. Li's jars,

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,822
and affect the results
of the experiment,

144
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,000
you'll affect His Majesty's
litchi consumption!

145
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,360
How many heads do you have to lose?

146
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,800
No.

147
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,920
You're wrong.

148
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,560
The people helped

149
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,890
to relieve His Majesty's burdens.

150
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:15,933
If you won't let them do the relay,

151
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:17,066
can you give me a horse?

152
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,730
Yes.

153
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,133
- That's right.
- Can you give it?

154
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:21,120
Mr. Li, our horses

155
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,560
are all registered army horses,

156
00:08:22,622 --> 00:08:24,090
responsible for patrolling the border.

157
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,466
How can I lend it out so easily?

158
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,644
You won't allow me to use the people
or lend horses to me.

159
00:08:27,688 --> 00:08:28,600
How should I experiment?

160
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,140
- Yes.
- Yes.

161
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,310
You can't ask me about this.

162
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,950
I'm only responsible for serving you

163
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,320
and ensuring safety.

164
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,240
I should ask you.

165
00:08:35,444 --> 00:08:37,177
Are you going to continue
this experiment?

166
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,080
If not,

167
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,870
I'll lift the ban on Small East Gate

168
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,240
and report back.

169
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,820
Aren't you
making things difficult for me?

170
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:43,320
Get lost!

171
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,550
Ms. Amita is here!

172
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,600
Ms. Amita.

173
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,150
Ms. Amita.

174
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,080
Inspector He said

175
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,150
court assembly

176
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,750
is suspended
due to Mr. Li's experiment.

177
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,600
To ensure Hu merchants' interests,

178
00:08:57,644 --> 00:09:00,555
Hu Merchants' Association must
personally supervise this experiment.

179
00:09:00,644 --> 00:09:02,000
How come I haven't heard of it?

180
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,720
Mr. Li.

181
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,960
Inspector He said

182
00:09:06,022 --> 00:09:08,200
you and the horses
have been exhausted for days.

183
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,390
He ordered me

184
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,600
to give you some fine horses.

185
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,790
If the experiment fails,

186
00:09:15,844 --> 00:09:16,870
you can't get away with it

187
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,790
just by saying

188
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,030
there are no more horses.

189
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
As for the riders,

190
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,444
do you think we're qualified for it?

191
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,670
Are you serious?

192
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,480
Your riders have been riding for days.

193
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,870
They're already exhausted.

194
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,444
If they continue to hold on like this,

195
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,030
someone will probably die.

196
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,750
You're right.

197
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,030
The experiment continues!

198
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:49,440
- Alright!
- Alright!

199
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,150
- Alright!
- Alright!

200
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,240
She's clearly

201
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,910
trying to go against me.

202
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,200
Tell me

203
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,030
if Amita

204
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,120
hasn't gotten over

205
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,200
the dagger incident.

206
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,422
You misunderstood her, Inspector He.

207
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,000
Ms. Amita sent horses this time

208
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,066
because she knew
that the litchis' smell had changed.

209
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:15,733
Its taste will change overnight.

210
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,870
This experiment is doomed to fail.

211
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,480
That's why

212
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,320
Ms. Amita sent the horses

213
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,360
in your name.

214
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,790
First, it can show

215
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,960
your generosity

216
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,600
and concern for His Majesty.

217
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,000
Second,

218
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,630
it can also shut Li Shande up

219
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,720
and prevent him from using

220
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,240
the lack of horses as an excuse

221
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,840
for the failure of the experiment.

222
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,840
It'll eliminate

223
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,870
his idea of ​​raising money
to change his luck.

224
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,240
This will be
killing two birds with one stone.

225
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,270
Have you been to Small East Gate?

226
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:52,000
Is this experiment really failing?

227
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,360
One jar's smell has already changed.

228
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,790
The litchis will be rotting
and leaking juice within one day.

229
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,240
That's good.

230
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,720
I will go to Small East Gate tomorrow

231
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,390
as a farewell to Li Shande.

232
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,320
It's an honor for Li Shande

233
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,630
to have your presence.

234
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,911
I shall now take my leave.

235
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,733
Inspector He.

236
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,000
After Amita went there,

237
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,790
she became inseparable

238
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:27,120
from that darn soldier.

239
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,790
It's hard to do anything.

240
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,790
Let's put this matter aside for now.

241
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,670
Amita

242
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,000
has her own plans now.

243
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,866
I can't lose the big picture
for the small.

244
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,670
Let's maintain

245
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,240
this superficial peace for now.

246
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:44,910
I understand.

247
00:12:04,984 --> 00:12:05,720
Ms. Amita?

248
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,630
Why do you want to be a rider?

249
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,200
I want to compete with you.

250
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,390
I

251
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,320
was ambushed here last time.

252
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,030
Do you know who they are?

253
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,320
Don't worry.

254
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,240
I helped you get the amnesty.

255
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,870
I will protect you.

256
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,240
Follow me.

257
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,550
The horses are here!

258
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,600
The horses are here!

259
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,030
The horses are here!

260
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,340
(Sixth Day of The Experiment)

261
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,700
(Litchi Transportation Record)

262
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,960
Inspector He is here!

263
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,840
Mr. Li.

264
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,844
It's hard to work in such heavy rain.

265
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,240
Inspector He.

266
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,240
Look.

267
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,960
Your siege experiment

268
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,360
made the whole city

269
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,440
sleep restlessly.

270
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,870
Even our Lantern Festival

271
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,311
has never been so lively.

272
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,840
Look, Hu merchants

273
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,080
and the whole city

274
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,630
are looking forward

275
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,670
to your experiment results.

276
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,790
How is it going?

277
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,270
The horses are back!

278
00:14:24,044 --> 00:14:26,177
- The horses are back!
- The horses are back!

279
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,000
Hurry.

280
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,080
Unload quickly.

281
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,200
Mr. Li, look.

282
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,240
I support your work.

283
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,360
Even my adopted daughter

284
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,600
has become your rider.

285
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,150
My whole family is involved.

286
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,960
Be careful.

287
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,670
Go.

288
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,030
Godfather.

289
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,977
I supervised this experiment to protect

290
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,550
the association's interests.

291
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,600
You're always so thoughtful.

292
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,533
Let's take a look.

293
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,750
Mr. Li.

294
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,510
Jar C is dripping.

295
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,510
This...

296
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,360
Check it.

297
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,360
This...

298
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,000
Inspector He, it's dripping.

299
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,030
How can you

300
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,080
feed this
to His Majesty and Noble Consort?

301
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,790
No, you didn't see it clearly.

302
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,511
These litchis aren't picked
from the same tree,

303
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,219
so they're
at different stages of ripeness.

304
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,977
When you transport them, you'll
consider the ventilation and bumps.

305
00:15:32,977 --> 00:15:34,511
Each jar is different.

306
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,510
Li Shande.

307
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,844
Jar B is leaking juice.

308
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,510
What did you say?

309
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,080
This is also leaking?

310
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:44,644
There's only one jar left.

311
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,822
This experiment is over.

312
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,670
Where's Jar A?

313
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,750
Jar A. Bring it over!

314
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,320
Jar A.

315
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,030
Jar A is here.

316
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,200
It's all right.

317
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,120
It's all right.

318
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,270
Well...

319
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,840
Jar A is all right.

320
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,510
Jar A is all right.

321
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,120
The experiment continues!

322
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:27,711
- The experiment continues!
- Let me see.

323
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,510
It's all right.

324
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,240
The experiment continues!

325
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,030
Good!

326
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,750
Here.

327
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,533
One, two, three.

328
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,870
- Alright.
- Alright.

329
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,240
Go.

330
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,440
Didn't you tell me

331
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,270
this experiment is doomed to fail?

332
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,790
How come there's a jar

333
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,550
that's all right?

334
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,030
And this jar

335
00:18:11,577 --> 00:18:13,133
has been tossed around until now.

336
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,030
It's almost finished.

337
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,070
Why isn't it over yet?

338
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,350
The horse is back!

339
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,630
It's back.

340
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:24,830
It's back.

341
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,688
The road is cut off.

342
00:18:29,044 --> 00:18:29,920
The road is cut off!

343
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,640
Mr. Li, the road is cut off.

344
00:18:34,222 --> 00:18:35,733
The road on the mountain is cut off.

345
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,000
What? The road is cut off?

346
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,830
Are you alright?

347
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,160
Hurry, get off.

348
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,200
Hurry.

349
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,070
Be careful.

350
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,400
Where is the road cut off?

351
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,070
Not far ahead.

352
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,000
Don't fall.

353
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,200
Here, carry him here.

354
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,310
Mr. Li, the litchi is fine.

355
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,550
They're fine.

356
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,920
The litchis are fine.

357
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,790
Alright.

358
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:14,510
- The litchis are fine.
- Good!

359
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,310
The litchis are fine.

360
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,480
- Good!
- Good!

361
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,000
How about this?

362
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,830
We'll split into two groups.

363
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,270
Send two riders.

364
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,110
Yan.

365
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,640
Follow the established route

366
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,480
to the foot of the mountain first.

367
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,680
Li!

368
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,270
Li, come here.

369
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,977
Once you receive the double-layer jar

370
00:19:35,977 --> 00:19:37,688
at the mountain's foot,
continue the relay.

371
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,160
Got it?

372
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,640
Go.

373
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,790
Ms. Amita,
after picking up the double-layer jar

374
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,000
on this side of the mountain,

375
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,840
transport it back
to Small East Gate, alright?

376
00:19:43,844 --> 00:19:44,511
Alright.

377
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,200
Go.

378
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,200
You...

379
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,200
You lead people to repair the road.

380
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:48,709
Alright.

381
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,960
Don't put the relay in danger.

382
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,110
Alright, take action!

383
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,310
Hurry, go.

384
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,533
Go there and get the stuff.

385
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,960
Here, get out of the way.

386
00:21:02,288 --> 00:21:03,200
Get out of the way.

387
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,440
Am I the only one going up?

388
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,480
Come on.

389
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:15,510
Take the wooden basket and the rope.

390
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,070
Hurry.

391
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,640
Come on.

392
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,350
Come here. Hurry.

393
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:58,960
Here.

394
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,960
Be careful.

395
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,510
Go.

396
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,830
Is the rope here?

397
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,720
Hurry. Here.

398
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,160
Alright.

399
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,400
Use your hands with small rocks.

400
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
Are there any more ropes?

401
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,110
Be careful. Danger.

402
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,750
This rock won't work.

403
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,640
Get a rope.

404
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,640
Get a rope. Here.

405
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,160
Here. Hurry up.

406
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,270
Pry it hard.

407
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:43,790
Here.

408
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,270
Pry it hard.

409
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,480
Here, give it to me.

410
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,680
Pry it hard. Here.

411
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,400
Use a rope.

412
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,310
Rope. Here.

413
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,310
This won't work.

414
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,310
Put a stone underneath.

415
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,030
Put a stone underneath.

416
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:23,960
Run.

417
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,400
Somebody.

418
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,640
Take it.

419
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:37,070
Are you alright?

420
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,960
Try again.

421
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,270
Come on.

422
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,110
One, two, three!

423
00:24:54,313 --> 00:24:55,750
Get out of the way!

424
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,110
Get out of the way!

425
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,440
It's coming. The horse is coming!

426
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,830
The horse is coming.

427
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,790
Yan Yazhuang!

428
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,790
Get the horse.

429
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,160
Hurry. Get the jar!

430
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,310
Here.

431
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,310
Slowly!

432
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,160
Let's see how it is. Let's see.

433
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,790
Hurry, bring a torch!

434
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,640
Hurry, a torch!

435
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,200
Hurry.

436
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,880
Is this experiment over?

437
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,590
If it's over,

438
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,680
hurry and disperse.

439
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:45,830
Disperse.

440
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,720
Disperse!

441
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,200
Mr. Li.

442
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,270
Is the experiment

443
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,155
really over?

444
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,400
Everyone...

445
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,550
Everyone.

446
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,830
These days,

00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,880

Mr. Li.

479
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,110
My litchi garden is still fine.

480
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,160
Look, the fruit is still fresh.

481
00:31:26,422 --> 00:31:28,311
But we Dong people
have a secret technique

482
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,640
to preserve it longer.

483
00:31:29,711 --> 00:31:30,622
What secret technique?

484
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,288

Hard work pays off after all.

488
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,750
The last court assembly

489
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,750
was paused because of Su's project.

490
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,880
Now,

491
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,355
Mr. Li has completed his experiment.

492
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,270
I believe you

493
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,880
have made a decision

494
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,640
about Su's project.

495
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,110
I hope you'll carefully consider

496
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,200
and vote

497
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,070
on whether to continue

498
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,666
the litchi business.

499
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,200
Ms. Amita. Mr. Li

500
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,240
only had one experiment.

501
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,030
Should we give him

502
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,311
a chance for improvement?

503
00:32:22,644 --> 00:32:23,640
Suspending court assembly

504
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,000
has given this project a chance.

505
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,640
Mr. Li racked his brains

506
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,590
to think of a good plan.

507
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:29,444
But he still can't transport litchis

508
00:32:29,488 --> 00:32:30,466
to Chang'an.

509
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,160
Ms. Amita!

510
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,177
Ms. Amita, I'm Li Shande!

511
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:35,960
Li Shande is here.

512
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,480
Lan Yu.

513
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,270
Invite Mr. Li inside.

514
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:40,880
Yes.

515
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,550
Mr. Li, please.

516
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,288
Ms. Amita.

517
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,510
I brought your iris back to life.

518
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,800
I've done what I promised you.

519
00:33:02,866 --> 00:33:05,088
Did you come all the way here
to send me the flowers?

520
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,640
No, I mean...

521
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,750
This iris

522
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,960
can survive

523
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,400
in this pot,

524
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,000
and so can litchis.

525
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,000
Right? Litchis can do the same.

526
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:21,880
Look.

527
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,000
A litchi tree

528
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,880
is planted in this pot.

529
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,790
A child

530
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:29,240
planted this branch in the soil

531
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,911
and took care of it carefully.

532
00:33:30,933 --> 00:33:31,888
It survived until now.

533
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,030
This branch

534
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:33,830
has withered,

535
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,270
but the fruit
looks like it was just picked.

536
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,590
Using this method,

537
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,088
litchis can be preserved
for five to six days.

538
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,110
Mr. Li.

539
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,640
We all witnessed the failure
of your experiment.

540
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,350
You suddenly

541
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,400
brought out a pot of litchis

542
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,720
and said you could buy time.

543
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,790
Who will believe you?

544
00:33:49,022 --> 00:33:50,550
This litchi tree was cut from the tree

545
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,640
before the experiment.

546
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,009
During the experiment,
it has been planted in the soil.

547
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:56,566
If you don't believe it, you can go
to Small East Gate and ask around.

548
00:33:56,566 --> 00:33:57,644
Everyone can testify.

549
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,590
Even if this is true,

550
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,070
litchi branches are so weak

551
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,790
that it's difficult
to survive in the soil.

552
00:34:03,955 --> 00:34:05,555
If it was tossed around in the jars,

553
00:34:05,622 --> 00:34:07,244
wouldn't it have fallen apart long ago?

554
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,550
No.

555
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,510
Everyone.

556
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,960
This litchi tree is weak,

557
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,150
but we can find

558
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,422
one that isn't weak, right?

559
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,550
We can find

560
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,030
a healthy litchi tree, right?

561
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,244
Find the kind with a strong trunk.

562
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,480
Just chop the branches in half,

563
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,590
put them in the jar,

564
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,650
and plant them in the soil.

565
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,400
The fruits

566
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,150
are on the branches,

567
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,666
which can continue to grow in the soil.

568
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,230
When

569
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,510
the branch has withered,

570
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,150
the fruit

571
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,000
is still fresh.

572
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,440
Look, water is gushing.

573
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:33,630
Look.

574
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,190
How many days

575
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,400
can the preservation be extended?

576
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,150
I call this the branching
and jar planting method.

577
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,070
Combined with the previous methods

578
00:34:46,355 --> 00:34:48,244
of washing with salt
and separation by water

579
00:34:48,288 --> 00:34:50,288
litchis can be kept fresh
for up to 11 days.

580
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,320
- 11 days?
- 11 days?

581
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,590
No way.

582
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,400
11 days.

583
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,320
How many days

584
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,190
do you plan to take

585
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,355
from Lingnan to Chang'an?

586
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,710
According to the route I planned,

587
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,320
it will be exactly 11 days.

588
00:35:12,088 --> 00:35:13,355
The strategy I designed.

589
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,644
Take a look.

590
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,440
Here, pass them around.

591
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,110
Pass them around.

592
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,620
(Litchi Transport Route Strategy)

593
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,755
It'll keep fresh for 11 days.

594
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,280
The journey takes 11 days.

595
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,800
His Majesty and Noble Consort

596
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,030
can eat fresh litchis

597
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:36,960
right away.

598
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,960
It's like it's already in your mouth.

599
00:35:39,622 --> 00:35:40,590
You're amazing, Bro...

600
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,710
You're outstanding.

601
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,760
Outstanding.

602
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,320
Wait.

603
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,190
This is wrong.

604
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:49,960
What's wrong?

605
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,400
Your strategy mentioned

606
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,670
the transport team will cross Mount Lu

607
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,550
to enter Xunyang,

608
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,920
cross Yangtze River and pass Qichun.

609
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,360
It's indeed an excellent route.

610
00:35:59,422 --> 00:36:01,700
But Xunyang was hit by a flood
the day before yesterday.

611
00:36:01,777 --> 00:36:03,000
The official road was blocked.

612
00:36:03,022 --> 00:36:04,960
We don't know
when the repairs will be completed.

613
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,510
Impossible.

614
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:07,440
Xunyang is hit by a flood?

615
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,230
Mr. Fan, don't exaggerate.

616
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,110
Why have I

617
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,200
never heard of Xunyang's flood?

618
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,488
I also heard about it.

619
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,800
Not just Xunyang County,

620
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,755
but several counties
and towns in Jiangzhou

621
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,960
also suffered from floods.

622
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,000
Mr. Li.

623
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,150
If there's really a flood,

624
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,777
do you have any other routes?

625
00:36:43,266 --> 00:36:44,360
Xunyang's official road

626
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,630
is the fastest route.

627
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,590
If a flood really occurred,

628
00:36:49,155 --> 00:36:50,555
we have to take a detour.

629
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,760
Taking a detour will take two more days.

630
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,590
That means

631
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,630
you need

632
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,590
at least 13 days.

633
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,000
Mr. Li.

634
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,440
I admire your honesty.

635
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,710
You didn't deceive business people.

636
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,550
But your transport plan

637
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,244
is still a mirage

638
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,920
after all.

639
00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:30,555
It looks beautiful

640
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,840
but unrealistic.

641
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,510
This is just business, right?

642
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,920
Who would want a money-losing business?

643
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:00,630
He's not technically capable of it.

644
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,190
Why should we continue to invest?

645
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,466
Won't we be throwing money into the sea?

646
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,070
Look at where you're seated.

647
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,070
Do you have a say?

648
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:10,760
Mr. Li.

649
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,800
Do you have any other ideas?

650
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:17,920
Yes.

651
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,440
Yes!

652
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,510
Let me think.

653
00:38:23,755 --> 00:38:25,710
There are other possibilities.
Let me think.

654
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,590
After leaving Lingnan,

655
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,190
go north.

656
00:38:37,222 --> 00:38:38,630
Go north and you'll pass the Wuling.

657
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,088
The road through Wuling
is the toughest and most difficult.

658
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,000
We'll spend

659
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,760
a lot of time here.

660
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,590
If we can find

661
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,880
a new road here,

662
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:46,960
we can save two days.

663
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,866
We can save two days.

664
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,840
It's easier said than done.

665
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,590
Many merchants

666
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,920
have traveled for years.

667
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,230
If there's an easy path,

668
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,680
it would have been discovered long ago.

669
00:38:58,688 --> 00:39:00,244
How will you know if you don't try?

670
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,511
Try to see if it will work first.

671
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:03,670
When I first

672
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,550
received this task

673
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,622
in Chang'an,
it was a doomed task, right?

674
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,266
Litchis would go bad in three days.

675
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,400
There's no way to transport them.
What happened then?

676
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,577
When I arrived in Lingnan,

677
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
I found a way

678
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,190
and then another way.

679
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,630
There's one way after another.

680
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,110
Every time I thought it was impossible,

681
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:18,920
I took

682
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,880
a step closer

683
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,920
to the possibility.

684
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,150
I witnessed

685
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,150
everything Mr. Li said.

686
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:32,320
Mr. Li is simple and honest.

687
00:39:32,488 --> 00:39:34,222
He has never been one for sweet talk

688
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,630
and would never deceive anyone.

689
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,190
That's why

690
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,920
he told

691
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,440
the truth.

692
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,920
He knew

693
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:46,288
that transporting litchis
wasn't an easy task,

694
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,320
but he still persevered.

695
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,190
I

696
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,230
admire Mr. Li's character.

697
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,110
I believe

698
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,150
Mr. Li will come up

699
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,440
with a better solution

700
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,030
to turn danger into safety.

701
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,440
I'm

702
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,400
willing to hand over all my wealth

703
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,150
to Mr. Li

704
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:13,222
and share wealth and woe with Mr. Li.

705
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,670
Everyone.

706
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,022
Right Chancellor assigned this task

707
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,110
to Mr. Li

708
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,070
because he trusts

709
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,230
Mr. Li.

710
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,030
We're business people.

711
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,800
Business people focus on profit.

712
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,670
Profit seekers focus
on knowing who to trust.

713
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,190
We're not just investing

714
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,480
in a business.

715
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,630
We're investing

716
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,488
in the people behind it.

717
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,688
I finished talking.

718
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,555
I'm merely an official

719
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,111
of the lowest ninth rank.

720
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,070
My monthly salary in Chang'an

721
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,866
is ten guan.

722
00:41:16,244 --> 00:41:17,320
After paying the porters,

723
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,622
I can barely make ends meet
by the end of the month.

724
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,150
But Su gave me
a large sum of money today.

725
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,800
It's a huge number for me.

726
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,630
I can go back to Chang'an with this money.

727
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,230
I can let my daughter

728
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,630
grow up safely

729
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,510
with a roof over her head.

730
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,960
But I took this money

731
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,230
to do an experiment.

732
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,400
I just want to survive.

733
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:44,960
Of course.

734
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:47,110
My life is not important to you.

735
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,030
But what I want to tell you

736
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,022
is that I want to survive.

737
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,111
Father!

738
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,360
I desperately want to survive.

739
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,440
I want to use my life

740
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,280
to make this deal happen.

741
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,280
So I won't let you down

742
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,600
for supporting me.

743
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,911
I won't let you down.

744
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,360
You've heard so much.

745
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,110
I believe everyone

746
00:42:30,777 --> 00:42:32,000
has your answer.

747
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,688
Let's vote.

748
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,780
=The Litchi Road=

749
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,480
Amita.

750
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,280
I want results.

751
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,800
Can the name be changed?

752
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,920
Let's call it fortune fruit.

753
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,230
It will definitely boost sales.

754
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,960
Can you change all these jars to red?

755
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,360
It'll be jubilant.

756
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,320
And those horses.

757
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,030
What horses?

758
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,360
Is this going to end?

759
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,630
If you keep doing this,

760
00:42:55,644 --> 00:42:57,622
won't my litchi transportation
become a joke?

761
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:58,550
