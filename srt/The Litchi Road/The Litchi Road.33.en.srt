1
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,999
=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,360
(Head Ornament)

3
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,259
Xiangling!

4
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,166
(11 Years Ago)
Xiangling!

5
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,330
(Southeast of Jianchuan)
Xiangling!

6
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,000
- Xiangling!
- Xiangling!

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,910
It's already this late.

8
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,155
I don't think this bodes well.

9
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,480
Hurry and search for her.

10
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,870
Xiangling!

11
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,450
Over here!

12
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,910
- Over here!
- Hurry!

13
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,980
I found her!

14
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,330
Xiangling!

15
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,690
She's this young, but...

16
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:01,800
- I'm sure she encountered a bandit.
- My daughter!

17
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,511
They must've robbed her
and taken her life.

18
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:05,466
That's right.
Even her head ornament was stolen.

19
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,200
This was a horrible way for you to go!

20
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,560
Xiangling!

21
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,000
Xiangling was such an unfortunate child.

22
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,450
Do you think the bandit is still nearby?

23
00:02:15,577 --> 00:02:16,920
Let's head back and check it out.

24
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,670
I wonder if Yu has returned.

25
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,800
Is this blood?

26
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,830
The door is open.

27
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,940
There's blood too.

28
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,930
Is there a bandit?

29
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,555
Yu!

30
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,750
(Young Yu Cheng'en)

31
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,530
Father, look.

32
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,840
Why do you have
Xiangling's head ornament?

33
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,010
Could it be that you...

34
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,530
You animal!

35
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,610
How dare you commit
such a despicable deed?

36
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,090
I didn't mean it.

37
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,040
I just wanted to take a look.

38
00:02:58,088 --> 00:03:00,050
It's Xiangling's fault
for not showing it to me.

39
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,955
Our boy is still young and insensible!

40
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,644
The head ornament...

41
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,970
My head ornament...

42
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,940
I will definitely obtain

43
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,490
the things I desire!

44
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,511
I'll keep you alive for now.

45
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:21,822
I'll send you to the local authorities
tomorrow morning!

46
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,420
That animal.

47
00:04:29,822 --> 00:04:30,711
There's someone here!

48
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,755
This is great. He's still alive.

49
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,170
He's awake.

50
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,210
(Young Yun Qing)
Qing, since he's awake,

51
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,140
we should leave.

52
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,210
Father, can we take him in?

53
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,170
But...

54
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,190
I have nowhere to go.

55
00:04:55,244 --> 00:04:56,355
Both of my parents are dead.

56
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,890
Benefactor, please take me in.

57
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,740
Father, let's take him in.

58
00:05:00,755 --> 00:05:01,780
We're about the same age.

59
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,140
At least I'll have a new playmate.

60
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:03,888
All right, then.

61
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,370
This is great.

62
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,470
(Tanzhou)

63
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:18,970
Here you go.

64
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,970
Bucky, Yu, go and get some water.

65
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:24,970
Bucky, Yu, go and chop some firewood.

66
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,700
Hurry up!

67
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,240
That was exhausting.

68
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,980
It's so high!

69
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,100
It's so high.

70
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,780
It looks great.

71
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:40,690
I'm so envious of them.

72
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:44,820
Let's go.

73
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,440
Father, I'll check that place out.

74
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,730
Qing, don't go too far.

75
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,740
We'll depart soon.

76
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,990
Goods for sale.

77
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,760
Over here.

78
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,720
Here you go.

79
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,080
Bucky, capture it!

80
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,020
Lift me up.

81
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,010
What did you see?

82
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,490
Qing, here's a birthday gift for you.

83
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,630
Father, help me put it on.

84
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,410
All right.

85
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,700
(That's my head ornament!)

86
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,590
So beautiful.

87
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,000
Yu?

88
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,710
Boss, why don't we target them?

89
00:07:19,577 --> 00:07:22,111
(Dragon in the Waves, He Youguang)
They're delivering tributes

90
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,177
from Lingnan to Chang'an.

91
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,010
No one is to act recklessly
until we pass Shuiyi Post tomorrow.

92
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,533
If not, it might foil our plan.

93
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,460
Dragon in the Waves, known for
his viciousness and cruelty,

94
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,640
is only capable of currying favor

95
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,520
and playing the fool now, huh?

96
00:07:39,644 --> 00:07:40,822
You must have a death wish!

97
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,230
Do not tell anyone about
what happened tonight.

98
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,520
(I knew it.)

99
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,933
(What gives you the right
to steal my thing?)

100
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,570
You mustn't!

101
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,020
Father!

102
00:08:13,422 --> 00:08:15,530
We've encountered crooks!
Hurry and go into hiding!

103
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,170
Who are you guys?

104
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:00,688
Boss,

105
00:09:00,688 --> 00:09:02,850
we only meant to poke around
and score a little bonus.

106
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,866
I never expected us
to obtain such a huge catch.

107
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,850
How dare you bite me?
You must have a death wish!

108
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,520
She's fair and petite.

109
00:09:17,555 --> 00:09:19,330
I'm sure we can sell her
for a good price.

110
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,270
Keep her alive.

111
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,060
Count yourself lucky.

112
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,200
Hurry.

113
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,355
Pack up so that we can go.

114
00:09:43,777 --> 00:09:45,140
Return my head ornament to me!

115
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,250
Return my head ornament to me!

116
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:48,790
Stop it!

117
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,066
Yu, have you lost your mind?

118
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:51,090
That's our mistress!

119
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,610
Stay out of my business!

120
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,210
Go and see what they are doing.

121
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,200
He's too vicious and cruel.

122
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,200
Spare him now,
and he'll turn into a threat later.

123
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:31,090
But killing him will dirty our hands.

124
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,820
Let him perish by himself.

125
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,410
Take this.

126
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,210
Mister, thank you for saving me.

127
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,290
My name is Yu Cheng'en.

128
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,420
My master's family was
massacred by the pirates.

129
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,790
I'm seriously wounded as well.

130
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,040
Please take me in

131
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,770
so that I can avenge them in the future.

132
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,560
Although you're young,

133
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,866
I never expected you to be
a man of honor and duty.

134
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,980
=Episode 33=

135
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:33,800
Admiral,

136
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,990
if you take another step out of Lingnan,

137
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,010
that means you intend to rebel.

138
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,010
Once you do this,
there will be no salvation for you.

139
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,010
We only heed the command of

140
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,590
those with the military tally.

141
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,330
Admiral,

142
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:50,960
please think twice.

143
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,650
We've never seen Inspector He before.

144
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,340
Why should we judge the matter
by his words alone?

145
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,330
Admiral,

146
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,650
what the envoy said

147
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,970
was precisely what
we were worried about.

148
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,850
Even if we do return to the sea,

149
00:12:05,977 --> 00:12:08,066
we're merely obeying
the Right Chancellor's order.

150
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:09,400
There is no one else to blame.

151
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:12,850
Admiral,

152
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,100
if we insist on going forward now,

153
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,450
we'll be branded as the rebel army.

154
00:12:16,622 --> 00:12:17,650
There's no turning back.

155
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:20,377
Our clans and families
might be executed for this.

156
00:12:26,844 --> 00:12:28,733
You guys just need
to follow the command.

157
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,170
I'll bear all of the consequences.

158
00:12:31,555 --> 00:12:33,670
Admiral, please pardon me
for not being able to do so.

159
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,044
Our brothers protect the sea borders
as we guard over Tang.

160
00:12:36,044 --> 00:12:36,890
We may die in battle,

161
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,555
but we mustn't be branded as traitors.

162
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,200
This time, Inspector He wants us
to come ashore.

163
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,544
Our coastal defenses will be weak.

164
00:12:43,544 --> 00:12:45,755
If someone takes advantage of it,
the people will suffer.

165
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,140
No matter what happens, we should

166
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:47,930
return to the sea.

167
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,890
Admiral, please think twice!

168
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,000
- Admiral, please think twice!
- Admiral, please think twice!

169
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,355
Admiral, please think twice!

170
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,330
I brought an item

171
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,330
from Chang'an.

172
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:01,830
Inspector He,

173
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,750
I wonder if you'll like it.

174
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,240
Inspector Yu,

175
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,130
what do you mean by this?

176
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,370
Inspector He,

177
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,530
this isn't

178
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,190
any ordinary item.

179
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,570
I know that you're fond of jade.

180
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,450
This is jade from Dianxi.

181
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,530
It was a gift from Wang Liang,

182
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,088
the inspector of Xichuan in Jiannan.

183
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,530
I'm just passing on
someone else's kindness.

184
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,530
I'm presenting it to you

185
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,160
as a token of appreciation.

186
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,390
Inspector Yu,

187
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,410
I appreciate the effort.

188
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,210
This is a rare item.

189
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,850
May I know why Wang Liang

190
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,010
gave it to you as a gift?

191
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,170
He's a frontier official.

192
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,010
He thinks
that he's too distant from His Majesty.

193
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,310
Therefore,

194
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,777
he tried to come up with something.

195
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,570
He hid some weapons

196
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,610
and kept an army.

197
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,740
In the end, His Majesty
took notice of it.

198
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,410
Wang Liang was so flustered

199
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,190
that he ran all the way to Chang'an
just to kowtow

200
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:25,711
and present gifts of apology to us.

201
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,650
But in the end,

202
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,760
he still failed
to prevent his execution.

203
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,540
Inspector He,

204
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,355
don't you think that was unnecessary?

205
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,500
Inspector Yu, your words

206
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,800
are deep and profound indeed.

207
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,450
I am but a blunt man.

208
00:14:47,644 --> 00:14:48,888
I don't get what you mean.

209
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,020
I'm sure you called me here

210
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,530
to discuss something important.

211
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,370
There's no need to beat around the bush.

212
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,410
Please cut to the chase.

213
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,770
Before I departed,

214
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,730
the Right Chancellor told me an idiom.

215
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:10,977
"To ride a donkey while striking a dog."

216
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,250
I couldn't figure out what he meant

217
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,010
on my way to Lingnan.

218
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,610
But after I arrived at Lingnan,

219
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,570
I happened to understand
what Right Chancellor meant.

220
00:15:25,555 --> 00:15:28,466
The donkey always keeps its head down
and turns the millstone.

221
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,530
It's loyal to its master.

222
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,555
It never asks for more than it deserves.

223
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,050
You don't even need to whip it
for it to obey.

224
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,900
But a dog?

225
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,130
A dog is different.

226
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,260
A dog

227
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,290
has a keen sense of smell.

228
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,330
It rushes ahead when it smells meat.

229
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,555
It even bites its owner
if it doesn't get a bite of the meat.

230
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,810
One has to whip it to keep it in check.

231
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,590
The Right Chancellor

232
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,900
wanted me to find a solid candidate

233
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,840
who truly wanted
to serve the imperial court.

234
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,090
He also wanted me

235
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,490
to be wary of those
who have ulterior motives.

236
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,700
You're right.

237
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,710
The dogs surrounding Right Chancellor

238
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,130
should've been whipped long ago.

239
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,210
Especially those

240
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,444
who wave a chicken feather
like an imperial decree.

241
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,880
These dogs fake their loyalty

242
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,240
in order to ascend the ranks.

243
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,930
Not only do we need to whip them,

244
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:38,000
but we must also make sure
we whip them hard.

245
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,170
Inspector He,

246
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,350
great minds do think alike indeed.

247
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,570
Let me offer you a toast.

248
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,170
Inspector Yu,

249
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,580
if only we made
our acquaintances earlier.

250
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,620
I agree.

251
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,650
Cheers.

252
00:17:15,488 --> 00:17:16,290
Chief Scribe Zhao.

253
00:17:17,822 --> 00:17:19,088
The inspector has issued an order.

254
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:20,470
There's a change to tonight's plan.

255
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,422
Withdraw our troops now.

256
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,222
Withdraw our troops?

257
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,130
Chief Scribe Zhao,
Inspector He once said

258
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,488
that we mustn't withdraw our troops

259
00:17:25,488 --> 00:17:27,166
unless we receive an order
from him in person.

260
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,190
He's at Qifeng Pavilion now.

261
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,088
How could he come all the way here
to give order?

262
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,410
According to him,

263
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,309
if the navy admiral hasn't
received the secret letter

264
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,260
as per our previous plan,

265
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,990
it's best for him
to withdraw his troops tonight.

266
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,710
Just withdraw them.

267
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,333
Chief Scribe Zhao, although the letter
hasn't been delivered yet,

268
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,130
Inspector He said that tonight's plan
concerns our survival.

269
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,533
We can only follow his command.

270
00:17:44,622 --> 00:17:45,490
Chief Scribe Zhao,

271
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,690
please pardon us
for not being able to follow your order.

272
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,688
I'll give you the token.

273
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:49,980
Here you go!

274
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,530
Any other objections?

275
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,450
Open the door!

276
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,730
Captain Yang!

277
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:00,400
According to Chief Scribe Zhao,

278
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,380
there's a change to tonight's plan.

279
00:18:02,444 --> 00:18:04,840
The troops have already withdrawn
from the western outskirts.

280
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:05,690
Withdraw our troops?

281
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,890
How could that be?

282
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,450
The criminal, He Youguang,

283
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,130
has assassinated
the inspector of Chang'an.

284
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,349
He has already been executed!

285
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,250
Nonsense!

286
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,210
Take them down!

287
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,300
Where is He Youguang's head?

288
00:18:17,688 --> 00:18:19,466
If not, how dare you
spout such nonsense?

289
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,810
Follow me to Qifeng Pavilion.

290
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,680
The crimes of He Youguang
are as follows!

291
00:18:22,688 --> 00:18:24,733
He Youguang has conspired against
the imperial envoy!

292
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:25,977
We have solid evidence!

293
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,670
Today,

294
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,010
all those who were kept in the dark
may survive if they surrender.

295
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,570
Those who resist

296
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,400
shall be executed!

297
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,250
Go!

298
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,770
Let's go!

299
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,370
Let's go!

300
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,330
Inspector He,

301
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,620
you look a little restless.

302
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,866
Could it be
that you're waiting for someone?

303
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,280
Who can I wait for?

304
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,330
Yu,

305
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,090
it's been a whole night.

306
00:19:36,177 --> 00:19:37,690
Everything is shrouded in mystery.

307
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,510
I don't even know
who you were referring to just now.

308
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,260
Let's stop messing around.

309
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,570
Let's lay our plot bare.

310
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,088
Inspector He,
you're making it sound too serious.

311
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,060
I have no plot to lay bare.

312
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,080
I merely wanted

313
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,690
to catch up with you.

314
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,580
Go ahead, then.

315
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,430
I'm listening.

316
00:19:59,711 --> 00:20:01,000
Several years ago,

317
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,890
from a pirate, you turned into

318
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,610
a high-ranking frontier commander.

319
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,350
I heard that you found yourself

320
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,900
a backer in Chang'an.

321
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,300
In all of Chang'an,

322
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,650
there are but three people
who could help you

323
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,660
rise to power.

324
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,690
The first candidate

325
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,850
was His Majesty.

326
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,850
However, that year,

327
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,230
His Majesty devoted himself
wholeheartedly to the study of the Dao,

328
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,066
in pursuit of true freedom
upon the Great Way.

329
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,130
It's impossible for him

330
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,010
to take a liking to a layman like you.

331
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,790
The second candidate

332
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,220
was the ex-Right Chancellor.

333
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,810
But I think

334
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,730
it wasn't him.

335
00:20:51,288 --> 00:20:52,920
It's because he died from sickness

336
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,850
a few years after that.

337
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:56,560
The current Right Chancellor

338
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,090
replaced him after that.

339
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,810
Ex-Right Chancellor's
trusted aides and all his sons

340
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,850
were dismissed and exiled.

341
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:04,970
As for you,

342
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:09,450
you were unaffected.
You actually rose through the ranks.

343
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,490
Therefore, you didn't serve

344
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,070
the ex-Right Chancellor.

345
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,260
If so, there's only

346
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,360
one candidate left.

347
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,970
That person is a fool.

348
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,450
He's a fool who's known
throughout Chang'an.

349
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,450
He was of mixed barbarian descent.

350
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,369
He did Sogdian Whirl dance
in endless whirls,

351
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,933
light as wind despite his size.

352
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,050
Everyone thought he was a joke.

353
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,900
From His Majesty and the Noble Consort,

354
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,690
down to officials and commoners alike,

355
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,040
none beheld

356
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,300
the fangs behind the fool's mouth.

357
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,370
Inspector He,

358
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,890
you became one of his pawns

359
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,450
by accident during that moment,

360
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,410
right?

361
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,600
Inspector He,

362
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,580
are you curious as to

363
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,000
why I know that much about you?

364
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,060
Dragon in the Waves,

365
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,410
you were the one

366
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,377
who brought me to Chang'an.

367
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,977
Were you that evil kid?

368
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,010
Thanks to you,
I was able to join the palace.

369
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,650
All these years,

370
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,450
I knew that you became

371
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,500
the inspector of Lingnan.

372
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,066
I've had my eye on you for some time.

373
00:23:11,244 --> 00:23:12,970
It's just that I was
in the imperial court.

374
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,090
I couldn't see you in person.

375
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,290
Today,

376
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,490
we're picking up where we left off.

377
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:24,460
You and I truly have
a deep affinity for each other.

378
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,777
I suppose.

379
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,022
Why didn't I put you down back then?

380
00:23:36,222 --> 00:23:38,155
I was too soft-hearted.

381
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,810
Yu,

382
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,920
you're right.

383
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,050
I'm going to stage a rebellion.

384
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,890
I've already staged a rebellion!

385
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,280
I'm going to bring my troops across

386
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,830
the Five Ridges, the Yangtze River,

387
00:23:50,844 --> 00:23:52,840
and tread upon
the golden bricks with my steed.

388
00:23:52,844 --> 00:23:54,220
Wherever my troops have set foot,

389
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,250
the land shall become my territory.

390
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:58,650
It's a shame

391
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,880
that you cannot witness it yourself.

392
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,090
Indeed.

393
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,222
I don't think I can witness it myself.

394
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,010
Zhao,

395
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,377
take him down.

396
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,370
Zhao,

397
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,511
take down this castrated fool!

398
00:24:59,444 --> 00:25:00,330
Get out of my way!

399
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,490
Someone!

400
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:02,866
Where are my men?

401
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,688
Inspector Yu,

402
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,888
I've accomplished my task.

403
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:20,222
I appreciate your effort.

404
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,690
Are you turning on me?

405
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,570
Although my words carry no weight,

406
00:25:33,822 --> 00:25:35,688
please allow me to make a plea
for He Youguang.

407
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,530
I know that his crimes are unpardonable.

408
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,810
But I'm indebted to him!

409
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,650
Inspector Yu, please spare him.

410
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,250
I...

411
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,140
I'm willing to serve you

412
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,250
with everything I have!

413
00:25:49,688 --> 00:25:51,866
I vow to repay your kindness
even unto death!

414
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,300
Chief Scribe Zhao,

415
00:26:00,111 --> 00:26:01,622
you're making it sound too serious.

416
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:04,210
I'm just an attendant.

417
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,850
I don't have the courage

418
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,720
to kill a frontier commander like him.

419
00:26:10,711 --> 00:26:11,844
Chief Scribe Zhao,

420
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,140
please rise.

421
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,140
Inspector Yu.

422
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:32,930
Inspector He,

423
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,650
I suppose
our catching-up session is over.

424
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,170
However, all good things
must come to an end.

425
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,250
Farewell.

426
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,890
To the victor go the spoils.

427
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,170
I'm willing to accept my defeat.

428
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:58,230
Back then, Haihu trusted me the most.

429
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,410
I slew him.

430
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,530
Today, I trust him the most.

431
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,730
But he betrayed me.

432
00:27:06,288 --> 00:27:08,570
What goes around comes around.

433
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:13,650
I admit defeat.

434
00:27:21,488 --> 00:27:22,555
Farewell.

435
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:35,660
(Inspector's Office)

436
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,511
Open the door!

437
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,050
Open the door!

438
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:43,960
Inspector He!

439
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:44,690
You...

440
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,730
What are you...

441
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:47,980
Help me inside.

442
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,940
All right.

443
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,510
Stop him!

444
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,000
He's over there!

445
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:24,090
Hurry!

446
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:51,830
He's over there!

447
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:12,820
Lan?

448
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,130
This is for Feng.

449
00:30:20,044 --> 00:30:21,490
Who's Feng?

450
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,530
We found him!

451
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,800
He Youguang is over here!

452
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,950
Come here!

453
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,530
Beat him to death!

454
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,970
Stop it!

455
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:45,888
I am the Inspector!

456
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:48,711
Make way! Get out!

457
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,410
Run!

458
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,380
(Gaozhou)

459
00:32:02,222 --> 00:32:03,170
You and my father

460
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,810
have been waiting for this day
for ten years.

461
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,170
I suppose this lifetime of mine

462
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,210
was quite fun indeed.

463
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:25,020
Excellent!

464
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,130
Inspector Yu,

465
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,530
He Youguang died last night.

466
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,230
I haven't really moved around much

467
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,850
these few days in Lingnan.

468
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,050
It's time for me

469
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,770
to take a stroll.

470
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:13,850
Yes, sir.

471
00:33:29,622 --> 00:33:30,570
Take a look at this.

472
00:33:30,688 --> 00:33:31,610
Someone, lend me a hand.

473
00:33:39,244 --> 00:33:41,244
Look at how much fortune
He Youguang has amassed.

474
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:42,840
Two paintings.

475
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,230
One register.

476
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:53,733
Let me take a sip of water.

477
00:33:59,070 --> 00:33:59,370
Here.

478
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,050
Get out of the way!

479
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:08,880
Make way!

480
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,940
Great-Uncle.

481
00:34:14,444 --> 00:34:15,622
Inspector Yu is here.

482
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,490
Greetings, Inspector Yu.

483
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,030
Be careful.

484
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:28,850
Inspector Yu,

485
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,059
we're doing an inventory count

486
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,330
of the unlawful assets acquired by
the criminal, He Youguang.

487
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:33,266
Inspector Yu,

488
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,240
what are your orders?

489
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:37,170
Chief Scribe Zhao, just proceed
according to the law.

490
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:39,930
By the way,

491
00:34:40,977 --> 00:34:42,140
has anyone found a hairpin

492
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,400
that serves as a head ornament

493
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,890
in Qifeng Pavilion last night?

494
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,410
Wang, hurry!

495
00:34:47,444 --> 00:34:48,190
Take some of our men

496
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,400
and find the hairpin!

497
00:34:49,444 --> 00:34:49,911
Yes, Sir.

498
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:50,600
Xing!

499
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,870
- Inspector Yu.
- Let's go.

500
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,730
Hurry!

501
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,250
Inspector Yu, please.

502
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:04,930
Inspector Yu,

503
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,700
these are all the possessions

504
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:09,170
(Assets of He Youguang)
of the convicted official He Youguang.

505
00:35:09,177 --> 00:35:10,570
Please review it.

506
00:35:16,555 --> 00:35:18,370
This is truly disheartening to see.

507
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,300
He Youguang has let down

508
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,733
Right Chancellor for nurturing him.

509
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,730
He's deranged and inhumane.

510
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,000
We shouldn't

511
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,810
present this to Right Chancellor
as it might affect him.

512
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:33,670
Yes, Sir.

513
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,730
I was inconsiderate.

514
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,620
I shall instruct my men
to deliver everything

515
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,530
to Huji Restaurant in Pingkang Ward.

516
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,511
Madam Shiqi shall take charge of them.

517
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,290
Thank you, Chief Scribe Zhao.

518
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,730
Inspector Yu, there's one more thing.

519
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:51,044
Tomorrow is the day
of the monthly council meeting

520
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,850
at the Inspector's Office.

521
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:55,070
We can use the opportunity to announce

522
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,500
to officials of all ranks in Lingnan

523
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,688
that the criminal, He Youguang,

524
00:35:57,711 --> 00:35:59,244
took his own life to avoid punishment.

525
00:36:00,288 --> 00:36:01,044
I've drafted

526
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,050
a notice.

527
00:36:04,266 --> 00:36:05,911
Inspector Yu, please review it.

528
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,610
The criminal, He Youguang,

529
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,960
though charged with
guarding the frontier,

530
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,440
forsakes state affairs.

531
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,580
Though bearing the title of Inspector,

532
00:36:16,622 --> 00:36:18,422
he spares no thought
for the people's plight.

533
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:21,430
He hoards troops to consolidate power
and embezzle funds.

534
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,640
Embezzle funds?

535
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,300
Do not bring that up.

536
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,090
That might implicate
the Right Chancellor.

537
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,120
As for his rebellion,

538
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,660
you shouldn't bring it up either.

539
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:42,130
If Right Chancellor's political rivals
were to use this to their advantage,

540
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,240
it would result in a calamity.

541
00:36:49,444 --> 00:36:51,266
Why don't you put it this way?

542
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,730
He Youguang

543
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:58,170
founded the Litchi Fund, right?

544
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,290
Just say

545
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:05,480
that he wanted to embezzle funds through
the tasks His Majesty had assigned.

546
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,530
As the Litchi Inspector,

547
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,380
I tried to persuade him to stop.

548
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,610
But he actually tried to take my life.

549
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,210
After his deeds were exposed,

550
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:16,777
he took his own life
to avoid punishment.

551
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:18,100
What do you think?

552
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,380
For the Litchi Fund,

553
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,410
all the people of Lingnan,

554
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,490
including me,

555
00:37:24,622 --> 00:37:26,120
were forced to contribute to it.

556
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,760
He has sinned! He...

557
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,100
Chief Scribe Zhao,

558
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,930
do not worry.

559
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,410
Once I return to Chang'an,

560
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,480
I'll report this to Right Chancellor.

561
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:39,590
This is the fault of He Youguang alone.

562
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,400
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

563
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,010
Besides,

564
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,890
you were only just following orders.

565
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:50,970
What happened last night ends here.

566
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:55,450
I won't press charges
against anyone else.

567
00:37:58,755 --> 00:37:59,930
Thank you, Inspector Yu.

568
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,610
Chief Scribe Zhao,

569
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,970
the festering rot in Lingnan
has finally been purged.

570
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,700
You were a major contributor.

571
00:38:16,244 --> 00:38:17,777
I dare not claim any credit.

572
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:22,730
We must promptly proceed with

573
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,690
the litchi transfer operation.

574
00:38:25,088 --> 00:38:27,044
The Noble Consort's
birthday banquet is nearing.

575
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,290
His Majesty intends
to hold a litchi banquet.

576
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,630
The entire Chang'an

577
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,800
is excited about it.

578
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,610
It's a festive occasion.

579
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,270
We must make sure the Noble Consort

580
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,800
feels the sincerity
of the people of Lingnan.

581
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:46,010
As for the carts, funds,
provisions, and manpower,

582
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,890
the more, the better.

583
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:50,940
Chief Scribe Zhao,

584
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,222
you don't have much time left.

585
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,090
You have to get to it immediately.

586
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,690
But I...

587
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,260
Don't tell me

588
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,800
you can't do it.

589
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,660
I'll try my best.

590
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,688
I appreciate your effort.

591
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,650
By the way,

592
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,866
how's the progress with

593
00:39:26,888 --> 00:39:28,666
Su Liang's double-layer jars?

594
00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:30,733
He refused to hand it over.

595
00:39:31,177 --> 00:39:32,570
We searched the entire cargo ship.

596
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,380
We couldn't find them.

597
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,340
That old fox.

598
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:41,355
Keep him locked away.
Do not release him.

599
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:42,600
Keep him imprisoned

600
00:39:42,888 --> 00:39:44,577
so that he won't cause trouble for us.

601
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,530
What about Li Shande, then?

602
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,530
Hurry and tell Li Shande

603
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,970
to come up with something.

604
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,060
There's a fire over here.

605
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,622
What are you guys making?

606
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:04,850
Bamboo rice.

607
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,920
Mr. Li!

608
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,610
I rushed all the way here.

609
00:40:12,866 --> 00:40:14,330
Listen, I have good news for you.

610
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,050
I've set Mr. Su free.

611
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:17,810
Where is he?

612
00:40:18,555 --> 00:40:19,755
But I have bad news too.

613
00:40:19,844 --> 00:40:20,955
After he was released,

614
00:40:21,022 --> 00:40:22,670
he raised the anchor
and left the harbor.

615
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,170
What? He...

616
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,420
He left the harbor?

617
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,870
Mr. Su

618
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:28,940
is truly intelligent.

619
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,911
Now that he knows
that the situation is dire,

620
00:40:30,955 --> 00:40:32,170
he sets sail immediately.

621
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,220
Wait, he...

622
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,570
I think

623
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,969
he has no loyalty for you at all.

624
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,300
When he left, he didn't leave even
a double-layer jar behind.

625
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,610
Hey, he can't just leave like that.

626
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,130
How can I transport them without jars?

627
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:42,700
That's right.

628
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,400
If that happens,

629
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,690
when His Majesty presses charges,

630
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,010
you will be executed too.

631
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,410
That's why I came here

632
00:40:47,466 --> 00:40:49,560
to see if we could come up
with a solution together.

633
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,230
What about the potters in Lingnan?

634
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:52,288
How's their work quality?

635
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,600
We have to depart
in three days!

636
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,750
I'll tell Maritime Trade Envoy

637
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:55,700
to notify other merchants

638
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,733
to check their warehouses

639
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,820
to see if they have any.

640
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,650
Just scram.

641
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,630
You...

642
00:41:00,133 --> 00:41:01,570
You have to come up with something.

643
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:02,780
Come up with something...

644
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,660
Why would Mr. Su

645
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,088
leave without bidding farewell?

646
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,170
To him,

647
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,420
I must be

648
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,610
a despicable ingrate.

649
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:21,733
What will you do
without the double-layer jars?

650
00:41:28,244 --> 00:41:29,311
Master Konglang.

651
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:30,990
He Youguang didn't have
any servants around

652
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,933
when he was in Qifeng Pavilion
with Yu Cheng'en.

653
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,370
Therefore, we have no idea

654
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,422
what he and Yu Cheng'en

655
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,790
had chatted about.

656
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,330
But that night,

657
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,810
Inspector Yu left something behind.

658
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,400
The staff there picked it up.

659
00:41:45,688 --> 00:41:47,622
After that, Inspector Yu
instructed his men

660
00:41:47,644 --> 00:41:48,490
to look for it.

661
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,370
Seeing that it might mean trouble,

662
00:41:51,422 --> 00:41:52,711
the staff handed the item to me.

663
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:07,050
Master.

664
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:12,370
Master?

665
00:42:14,133 --> 00:42:15,488
This is truly unexpected.

666
00:42:17,888 --> 00:42:20,088
I've been looking for my enemy
for many years.

667
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,210
It turns out

668
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,866
that he's right in front of me.

669
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,500
=The Litchi Road=

670
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:32,610
Chief Scribe Zhao,
you have lofty aspirations.

671
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:34,200
Swearing allegiance to Inspector Yu

672
00:42:34,288 --> 00:42:35,311
is unwise.

673
00:42:35,355 --> 00:42:36,844
He's more vicious than He Youguang.

674
00:42:36,866 --> 00:42:38,090
Does such a jar even exist?

675
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:38,810
No.

676
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,020
We trusted you.

677
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,330
We took you as a good friend.

678
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:48,590
But look at the disaster

679
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:49,670
you've brought upon us!

680
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,090
Return my litchi garden to me!

681
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:55,250
