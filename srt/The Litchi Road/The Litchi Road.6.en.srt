Throw it away.

00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,020
Yes.

6
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,020
Agarwood from Dianbai.

7
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,900
Usable.

8
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:23,755
This scent won the first place

9
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,333
at last month's incense competition.

10
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,860
Su Liang's.

The pillars in Chenxiang Pavilion,
Xingqing Palace,

12
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,500
are his tributes, right?

13
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,500
Yes.

00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,620
(Wine)

15
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,100
Su, you shouldn't have agreed to him.

16
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,340
How can you

17
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,780
get these materials

18
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,740
in such a short time?

19
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,700
You said that same

20
00:02:47,511 --> 00:02:49,955
when we were building
the Chenxiang Pavilion.

21
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,740
Look at the design.

22
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,780
Agarwood as the pavilion,

23
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:56,666
sandalwood as the railings,

24
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,780
musk, and frankincense sifted into
the soil,

25
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,333
and mixed into cement as the walls.

26
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,500
Right Chancellor wants to build
a Four Fragrant Pavilion.

27
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:07,777
It's more extravagant
than the Chenxiang Pavilion.

28
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,780
Especially that batch of Agarwood.

29
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,900
I bet

30
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,020
no one in Chang'an can provide it.

31
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,780
In Chang'an,

32
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,620
no one but Su Liang

33
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,860
can do it.

00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,420
I bought them long ago.

37
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,580
The ship has already sailed into
the inner bay.

38
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,180
It will dock soon.

39
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,180
Demigod.

40
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,220
Little devil.

41
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,260
Silently, quietly.

42
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,955
It's been kept completely secret.

43
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,300
Su, I bet

44
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:49,577
you're going to be elected
as the chief again.

45
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,100
Chief!

46
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,860
Chief!

47
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,260
Chief!

49
00:03:56,977 --> 00:03:58,066
When it passes Zhenzhou,

50
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,580
it gets robbed
by Chief Feng Ruofang's pirates.

51
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,420
(I heard Su Liang's merchant ship)

52
00:04:06,444 --> 00:04:07,620
(was robbed, is that right?)

53
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,740
(Yes.)

54
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,340
He was therefore dismissed

55
00:04:10,377 --> 00:04:12,266
from his position
as the Chief of Hu merchant.

56
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,420
Replace him
with Yangzhou's Xu's Incense.

57

58
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,860

has already started construction.

61
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,940
The materials are supplied by

62
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,780
an unknown shop in Yangzhou.

63
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,260
I know about it.

64
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,422
The material is mine.

65
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,500
None of the cargo

66
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,660
is redeemed.

67
00:04:58,266 --> 00:04:59,555

68
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,540

Give it to me!

76
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,500
If you want to take it on the road,

77
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,340
you'd better find a big, airtight jar

78
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,020
to seal it in.

79
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,133
That should be enough.

80
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,177
I know how to seal it.

81
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,940
Do you have any ways

82
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,380
to keep it fresh for longer?

83
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,266
I'll tell you another secret.

84
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,140
Don't spread this.

85
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:55,688
Otherwise, you'll bear the consequences.

86
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,580
I won't.

87
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,940
Before you place them in the jar,

88
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,340
you can soak

89
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,733
the litchis in salt water.

90
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,780
It can keep them fresh for three days.

91
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,820
Three days.

92
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,940
I tried the sealing method

93
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,020
and salt washing method

94
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,660
when I was working

95
00:06:13,711 --> 00:06:14,740
in the Shanglin Office.

96
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,820
I know about it.

97
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,060
I'm wondering if you people

98
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,844
have any secret methods

99
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:21,400
to keep the litchis fresh for longer.

100
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,300
Chief.

101
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,460
Captain Yang is here.

102
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,540
Wait for a second.

103
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,060
Move!

104
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,260

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:39,900
Come!

Chief.

107
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,900
I thought Captain Yang
not only lost his face but also his guts

108
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:48,400
(Captain Yang)
when he begged for mercy on his knees.

109
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:50,866
I didn't expect to see you again today.

110
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,420
I respect you as a man.

111
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,120
Don't move.

112
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,790
Don't you dare to move!

113
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,020
Today.

114
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,100
Either you pay your debts

115
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,620
or

116
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,100
hand over the garden.

117
00:07:08,111 --> 00:07:08,860
What are you doing?

118
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,111
- Don't move.
- How dare you!

119
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,780
- I'll kill you.
- Try me!

120
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,820
I've been raising money for a while.

121
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,180
That's all I have right now.

122
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,940
When I sell the fruit in May,

123
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,466
I'll be able to pay back more.

124
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,400
You have the face to give me

125
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,660
only this much money?

126
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,340
Do you not know

127
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,620
how much you owe me?

128
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,740
Listen.

129
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,340
Now,

130
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,620
hand over this garden

131
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,260
and consider your debt settled.

132
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,500
If the interest continues to compound,

133
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,020
these Dong people behind you

134
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,860
might never be able

135
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,244
to get back on their feet forever.

136
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:47,900
Tong.

137
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,340
You have to think about them, right?

138
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,460
Chief, don't listen to them.

139
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,300
We'll fight!

140
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:54,500
What are you doing? I'm warning you.

141
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,500
- Put it down!
- Put it down!

142
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,300
Put it down!

143
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,288
As long as we are still here,

144
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,500
we can always rebuild our home.

145
00:08:57,511 --> 00:08:59,177
No, we can't hand it to him.

146
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,300
Where's the document?

147
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,260
Give it to me.

148
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,220
Tong.

149
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,740
Tong.

150
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,100
Tong.

151
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,340
How many more days can you delay

152
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:13,666
with the water isolation method?

153
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,940
None of the methods can delay it.

154
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,390
Today is...

155
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,100
Shut up!

156
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,060
Hurry up, tell me.

157
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,666
Where did you come from?

158
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:19,950
What is this water isolation method?

159
00:09:19,955 --> 00:09:20,500
You put the...

160
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,420
She is signing over here!

161
00:09:21,422 --> 00:09:22,740
- Can you respect...
- Shut up!

162
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,900
Come.

163
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,020
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

164
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,770
- That jar in your place.
- Shut up!

165
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,620
Put the litchis in water.

166
00:09:31,644 --> 00:09:33,222
(Litchi Bureau)
How many more days

167
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:34,420
can you keep the litchis fresh

168
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,888
with the water isolation method?

169
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,820
Four days if it works.

170
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,400
Two days if it's not working well.

171
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,180
So that's six days in total.

172
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,940
From three days to six days.

173
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,420
It's great!

174
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:53,980
Awesome!

175
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,720
Six days!

176
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,511
- Six days is perfect!
- Are you two done?

177
00:09:56,511 --> 00:09:56,980
Tong.

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,140
Come over and sign the paper.

179
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:58,700
Shut up!

He wants to take over my garden.

182
00:10:02,177 --> 00:10:03,933
No way, you can't take over the garden!

183
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,333
You are not taking over.

184
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,380
Listen.

185
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,100
All the litchis in this garden

186
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:08,820
belong to me.

187
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,780
I want it.

188
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,100
I am

189
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,180
ordered by the Inspector's Office

190
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,220
to take over this garden.

191
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,300
If Inspector He blames me,

192
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,940
can you take the blame?

193
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,740
I am

194
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,580
ordered by His Majesty

195
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,500
to buy litchis from Lingnan.

196
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,260
If His Majesty blames me,

197
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,540
which one of you in Lingnan

198
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,780
can take the blame?

199
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,620
If that's the case,

200
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:38,900
you can have

201
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,220
the litchi garden.

202
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,020
But are you paying the debt

203
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,780
of the litchi garden?

204
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,820
Here.

205
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,820
Look.

206
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,860
What is it?

207
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,980
You don't have enough money now.

208
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,020
But you made such a big deal just now.

209
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,220
That's rude.

210
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:04,711
I thought some kind of God
just descended to help you.

211
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,540
Tong.

212
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,540
Just give up.

213
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,580
Good job!

214
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,460
Are you crazy?

215
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,740
The proof is gone.

216
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,780
Today,

217
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,460
you are not taking my garden
away from me.

218
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,020
If you want to charge me

219
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,866
for obstructing officers,

220
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,300
you can only bring me.

221
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,300
It has nothing to do with my people.

222
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,900
No one is taking her away!

223
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,300
I don't have money.

224
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:30,980
And you are not

225
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,666
taking my garden away from me.

226
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,540
You people

227
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,500
are just barbaric!

228
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,820
What are you doing?

229
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,020
Fight!

230
00:11:42,088 --> 00:11:42,860
Who dares to move?

231
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,060
I'll see who dares to move!

232
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,500
No one can touch her.

233
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,340
I am

234
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,660
the Litchi Envoy
appointed by His Majesty.

235
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,288
(Litchi Bureau)
Litchi Envoy.

236
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,280
Do you know about this?

237
00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:53,980
Litchi Envoy!

238
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,980
I hereby announce,

239
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,700
from today onwards,

240
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,600
that this garden is designated
as an Imperial Litchi Garden,

241
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,500
exclusively for the transportation
of tribute litchis.

242
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,088
About the debt owed
by the litchi garden,

243
00:12:06,088 --> 00:12:08,266
you'll probably
have to ask His Majesty for it.

244
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:16,220
- Ask His Majesty!
- Ask His Majesty!

245
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,180
Let's leave.

246
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,060
They're leaving!

247
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,900
Litchi Envoy!

248
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,140
You're really something!

249
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,820
- Litchi Envoy!
- Litchi Envoy!

250
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,400
It wasn't in vain
to take off your shoes.

251
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,340
- Litchi Envoy!
- Litchi Envoy!

252
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,310
You're really something!

253
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,260
Drink slowly.

254
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,460
There's no need to rush.

255
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,140
Li Shande has left.

256
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,100
Yes.

257
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,220
The guards at the north gate

258
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,444
saw him with their own eyes.

259
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,690
Not only did he leave the city,
but he also galloped away.

260
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,460
Looks like he was in a hurry.

261
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,660
It seems he's rushing back

262
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,100
to Chang'an.

263
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,580
Now,

264
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,620
you and Inspector He can rest.

265
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,420
Of course.

266
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,500
Guiyun is amazing.

267
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,020
In a day, we got rid of

268
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,780
the difficult Litchi Envoy

269
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,911
without a single soldier.

270
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,380
As expected of someone
by Right Chancellor.

271
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:23,460
Decisive and efficient.

272
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,460
Success with one move.

273
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,060
I'm really curious.

274
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,900
Guiyun,

275
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,740
how did you convince him?

276
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,740
A trivial skill.

277
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,900
Not worth mentioning.

278
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,660
Can you teach me?

279
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,140
In the hands

280
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,060
of a general,

281
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,820
the same knife can kill enemies;

282
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,060
in the hands of a butcher,

283
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,940
it can slaughter cows and chickens.

284
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:55,180
If you use the same tool

285
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,460
in different ways,

286
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,820
of course,

287
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,500
you'll get different results.

288
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,900
Look.

289
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,860
How do I teach you?

290
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,300
Guiyun.

291
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,700
You're an expert.

292
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,100
I used to be arrogant,

293
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,680
claiming to be born at the wrong time.

294
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,110
I feel like I'm overqualified
to work in Inspector's Office.

295
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:18,100
Today, seeing Guiyun,

296
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,740
I truly see the gap between us.

297
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,940
Admirable.

298
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,100
Extremely impressed.

299
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,180
Let's not talk about that.

300
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,260
I've been in Lingnan for some time.

301
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,540
Now that Li Shande has also left,

302
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,740
the military tally has been in my hands

303
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,340
for some days now.

304
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:41,533
Letter of allegiance, right?

305
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,780
Why are you back?

306
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,100
I'm not leaving.

307
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,220
Not leaving?

308
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,540
I'm not leaving.

309
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,400
I want to stay and transport litchis.

310
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,540
I think this is going to work.

311
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:19,260
(Right Chancellor's New Envoy
Has Departed)

312
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,940
Stronger!

313
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,400
Stronger!

314
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,020
Captain Yang.

315
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,600
I'm here to pick up the ship.

316
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,900
Su, I've told you.

317
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:49,820
Bohe Port

318
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,733
is the most important
tax area in Lingnan.

319
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,380
All ships are checked

320
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,580
for hidden cargo.

321
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,940
I'll let you know

322
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,140
when your ship

323
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,540
is ready.

324
00:15:58,711 --> 00:16:00,066
Go back and wait for the news.

325
00:16:00,088 --> 00:16:00,460
Nice!

326
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,700
Good one!

327
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,300
Next.

328
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,500
Go.

329
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,155
This is
the Lingnan Five Prefectures Pass.

330
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,140
Captain Yang,

331
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,660
please take a look.

332
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,020
It's written in black and white.

333
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,260
You can read it.

334
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,540
It says, within the five prefectures,

335
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,780
my ship can pass

336
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,900
any tax area.

337
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,860
Does it mean

338
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,460
my goods don't need to be inspected

339
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,111
and are ready for me to pick up?

340
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,900
Su is capable, indeed.

341
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,340
You can get

342
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,780
a magical pass.

343
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,580
If that's the case,

344
00:16:39,644 --> 00:16:41,311
proceed according to the regulations.

345
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,540
Let Su get his ship.

346
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,260
Squat lower!

347
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,580
Good!

348
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,180
Go!

349
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,820
Go!

350
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,980
Harder!

351
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,620
That's a chance!

352
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,660
Su.

353
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,860
Our ship is empty.

354
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,140
Empty?

355
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:04,700
Yes.

356
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,660
How could it be?

357
00:17:05,688 --> 00:17:06,560
I just went to check.

358
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,100
It's empty.

359
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,377
Use your body to press him.

360
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,580
Go!

361
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,420
Captain Yang.

362
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,460
What is it?

363
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,500
Why is my ship

364
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,460
empty?

365
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,540
Your ship is empty?

366
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,500
Completely empty.

367
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,820
I have a ship full of

368
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,340
benzoin.

369
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,460
Now, it has all disappeared.

370
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,780
All gone.

371
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,420
Captain Yang,

372
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,940
can you tell me

373
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,340
where my goods are?

374
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,780
Captain Yang should know

375
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,820
where my goods are.

376
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,220
Are you accusing me

377
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,260
of stealing your goods?

378
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,740
I didn't mean that.

379
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,820
Then what do you mean?

380
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,060
It says here
that one of the ships was seized.

381
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,620
The one I'm returning to you
is also a ship.

382
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,940
Furthermore,

383
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,500
you're carrying incense.

384
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,740
It's volatile.

385
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,900
It evaporates

386
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,500
or is blown into the sea
by the wind and waves.

387
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,980
That's possible.

388
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,620
You thief!

389
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,420
Give us back our goods.

390
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,820
How can it be empty?

391
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:14,666
- What are you talking about?
- How can it be empty?

392
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:15,460
Who are you pointing at?

393
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,300
Don't be rude.

394
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,620
Get back!

395
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,140
Captain Yang.

396
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,111
May I have a word?

397
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,780
Captain Yang,

398
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,300
can you

399
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,380
whisper to me

400
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,300
where I should

401
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,660
find my benzoin?

402
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,780
Su.

403
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,180
If I were you,

404
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,911
I'd stay in my hometown

405
00:19:03,022 --> 00:19:04,400
and start a small business.

406
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,311
I wouldn't go back to Lingnan.

407
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,140
Keep this money

408
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,260
for your own retirement.

409
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,140
Let's continue.

410
00:19:16,644 --> 00:19:18,266
How could such a large amount of incense

411
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,580
be transported
without anyone knowing about it?

412
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,940
Exactly.

413
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,180
My guess is

414
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,660
they

415
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,380
didn't steal it

416
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,100
but they must know

417
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,180
who is the one

418
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,820
behind it.

419
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,700
If they won't tell us,

420
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,500
that means they are telling us

421
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,060
that someone powerful

422
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,060
is behind this.

423
00:19:42,466 --> 00:19:43,980
Fragrances are not easy to store,

424
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,540
and holding onto them carries risks.

425
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,060
So,

426
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,580
they will definitely

427
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,911
want to get rid of the goods
as soon as possible.

428
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:53,420
Keep your eyes open

429
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,740
and your ears long.

430
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,980
No matter if they do it publicly,

431
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,340
or act in secret,

432
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,060
as long as they start selling,

433
00:20:03,044 --> 00:20:04,466
we'll keep an eye on them.

434
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,420
(B Hall)

435
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,750
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

436
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:20,311
You know I've been waiting
for an explanation.

437
00:20:20,977 --> 00:20:22,333
Why are you avoiding me?

438
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,620
Ge.

439
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,020
The walls of the jars are thin.

440
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,020
Handle with care.

441
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,820
Everyone leaves.

442
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,540
Li Shande.

443
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,620
I'll tell you the truth.

444
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,900
Inspector He wants to kill you.

445
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:53,133
The day after Zhao Xinmin went back,

446
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:54,288
he's been thinking about it.

447
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:55,300
I don't know how he knows

448
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,620
you work for Left Chancellor.

449
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,170
He said that you are not only
transporting litchis here

450
00:20:59,177 --> 00:21:01,780
but you actually
have other hidden intentions.

451
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,500
It's me.

452
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,340
I feel bad for Xiu'er.

453
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,380
I helped you out.

454
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,820
Mr. Li,

455
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:13,820
what Qilang said

456
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,100
is true.

457
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,580
It took him

458
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,220
a lot of effort

459
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,540
to convince them

460
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,980
that they would not kill you

461
00:21:22,177 --> 00:21:23,600
as long as you left Lingnan.

462
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,180
I'm the Litchi Envoy
appointed by His Majesty.

463
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:29,860
If they can kill me as they wish,

464
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,900
is there no law?

465
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,340
In Lingnan, he is the law.

466
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,740
Great then.

467
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,580
Anyway,

468
00:21:36,777 --> 00:21:37,780
I'll die if I go back,

469
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,900
and I'll die if I stay.

470
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,420
I might as well

471
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,088
try out the water isolation method

472
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,780
and fight for my life.

473
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,460
You're determined

474
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,700
to transport litchis, aren't you?

475
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,733
Well, it's not like I'm determined.

476
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,620
But,

477
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,340
I've never been so resolute.

478
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,780
This is thin

479
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,500
and fragile,

480
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,022
but light.

481
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,420
This is thick.

482
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,300
It's strong but heavy.

483
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,420
I'll number you all.

484
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,380
Let's see who will win

485
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,500
and be used by me.

486
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,460
If you succeed,

487
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,740
you'll be saving my life.

488
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,340
Then,

489
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,700
I'll worship you every day,

490
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,100
burning incense.

491
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,780
Alright.

492
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,980
You're number one.

493
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,060
Work hard at home.

494
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,500
I'm going to the city

495
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,400
to sell these two loads of March Red.

496
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,460
Then I'll buy you wine.

497
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,740
Okay!

498
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,300
Wine!

499
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:44,900
Thank you, Chief!

500
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,800
Press it down firmly.

501
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:46,580
Litchi Envoy.

502
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,740
Litchi Envoy.

503
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,740
Ban.

504
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:50,900
Cityman.

505
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,780
Litchi Envoy.

506
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,140
Litchi Envoy.

507
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,066
Why are you here?

508
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,200
Litchi Envoy.

509
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,380
I've told you.

510
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,260
This is the Imperial Litchi Garden.

511
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,580
Come, have a seat.

512
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,980
Litchi Envoy.

513
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,460
Before the first day of June,

514
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,580
I have to transport
the Gaozhou's litchis

515
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,060
to Chang'an.

516
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,500
So,

517
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,700
I'm here to get some March Red.

518
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:14,822
So I can experiment
with preserving the freshness.

519
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,780
I thought

520
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,140
you made up that story

521
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,460
to help us.

522
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:20,860
So you're really

523
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,700
transporting litchis.

524
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,340
Cityman.

525
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,140
You're talking about His Majesty.

526
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:26,980
Who is he?

527
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,622
Is he more powerful than Inspector He?

528
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,300
Of course.

529
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,300
His Majesty

530
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,620
is the most powerful person.

531
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,220
So there are no litchis

532
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,500
where he lives?

533
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,460
Nope.

534
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,700
His Majesty

535
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,900
lives in Chang'an,

536
00:23:48,444 --> 00:23:49,740
which is also my hometown.

537
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,020
It's 2500 km

538
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,260
from here.

539
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,540
What is 2500?

540
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,780
2500 km

541
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,460
is the concept of distance.

542
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,180
Well, it's far.

543
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,100
Is that

544
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,340
further than Shaozhou?

545
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,180
Much further.

546
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,300
Further than Shaozhou...

547
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,500
I don't get it.

548
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,020
Why didn't His Majesty

549
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,940
come to eat,

550
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,940
but send you here instead?

551
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,020
I want to know too.

552
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,060
Is Chang'an big?

553
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,180
Is it even bigger than a prefecture?

554
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,740
Much bigger.

555
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,620
Chang'an

556
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,220
isn't just big.

557
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,500
It's crowded too.

558
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,620
Packed with people.

559
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,540
The place where I work

560
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,820
is right next to Xingqing Palace.

561
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,100
Xingqing Palace

562
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,460
is His Majesty's home.

563
00:24:39,733 --> 00:24:41,900
That palace gate is even bigger
than the city gate.

564
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,980
Next to it is Zhuque Avenue.

565
00:24:48,244 --> 00:24:49,500
It's over a hundred paces wide.

566
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,340
Dozens of horses can ride side by side.

567
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,666
On both sides of the avenue
live high officials and nobles.

568
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,500
Sounds amazing,

569
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,300
but you don't even have litchis.

570
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:02,980
That's true.

571
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,740
Chang'an is wealthy.

572
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,060
We've got glossy rice
and clean white millet,

573
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,020
but no litchis.

574
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,700
In Chang'an,

575
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,955
we love flour-based food.

576
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,460
Especially hubing.

577
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,420
It's stuffed full.

578
00:25:14,533 --> 00:25:15,540
If it's baked just right,

579
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,580
and if you eat it hot,

580
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,620
it's absolutely delicious.

581
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,620
Sometimes when I'm late

582
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,780
for duty,

583
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,260
I'll grab one,

584
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,860
and share it with my daughter.

585
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,500
Walking down the street,

586
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,580
she takes a bite,

587
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,780
then I take a bite.

588
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,777
Then she takes another bite...

589
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,466
Are you missing home?

590
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,980
Longing for home,

591
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,600
in Chang'an.

592
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,220
Cityman,

593
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,380
don't be so down.

594
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,300
It's lively here.

595
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,500
Stay the night with us.

596
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,780
Enjoy a good meal.

597
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,740
There's wine too.

598
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,540
We have wine!

599
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,220
Try some.

600
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,300
What's this?

601
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,460
Game meat.

602
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,660
Wait...

603
00:26:23,755 --> 00:26:24,700
Is this even edible?

604
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,780
It's delicious.

605
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,700
I'll... I'll drink the wine.

606
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,420
What, you don't like it?

607
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,140
No.

608
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,980
I'm just thirsty.

609
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,100
What's that flavor?

610
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,660
Rice wine.

611
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,060
Soaked with a few litchis.

612
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,540
I thought so.

613
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,900
I knew March Red just came in.

614
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,755
There's no way it's been brewed already.

615
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,940
Why so picky?

616
00:26:54,177 --> 00:26:55,688
As long as it's wine, it's fine.

617
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,580
Right.

618
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,220
You seem like a decent guy.

619
00:26:59,622 --> 00:27:01,422
I wouldn't offer this to just anyone.

620
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,780
Drink up.

621
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,660
What's your name?

622
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,140
I'm Li Shande.

623
00:27:09,266 --> 00:27:10,533
Courtesy name Liangyuan.

624
00:27:10,577 --> 00:27:12,620
Li Shande, courtesy name Liangyuan.

625
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,600
Six characters? That long?

626
00:27:15,288 --> 00:27:16,111
Doesn't matter.

627
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:17,622
Just call me Li Shande.

628
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,300
Li Shande.

629
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,300
You said you miss home.

630
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,420
Why haven't you mentioned your wife?

631
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,900
My wife

632
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,020
passed away six years ago.

633
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,020
Left me with a little girl.

634
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,500
It's just the two of us.

635
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,500
My daughter

636
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,933
isn't much younger than you.

637
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,740
Seems like you're

638
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,860
someone who values love.

639
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,340
I was right about you.

640
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,340
Envoy Li, come dance with us.

641
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,180
No, you go ahead.

642
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,060
You dance.

643
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:51,900
Come on.

644
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,740
Li Shande.

645
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,580
Would you like to stay
in this litchi garden?

646
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,380
I'd love to.

647
00:28:20,844 --> 00:28:22,466
But I still need to
deliver these litchis

648
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,140
to Chang'an for His Majesty.

649
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,340
Then it's settled.

650
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,820
You'll stay and help me.

651
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,420
We'll tend the garden together.

652
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,580
Alright.

653
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,060
Back in Chang'an,

654
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:32,940
I tended nothing
but flowers and plants too.

655
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,100
I can help you

656
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,420
make this litchi garden

657
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,955
even more prosperous.

658
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:37,740
Really?

659
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,580
Yes!

660
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,820
Great.

661
00:28:41,977 --> 00:28:43,666
Then we should drink nuptial wine.

662
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,940
Nuptial wine?

663
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,780
United in heart and effort.

664
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,500
That's a good omen.

665
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,340
Come on.

666
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,300
I want to drink nuptial wine with him!

667
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:15,300
Drink!

668
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,700
Drink!

669
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,060
Drink!

670
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,700
Wait, Tong.

671
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,860
Are you mad?

672
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:47,711
(Yan Yazhuang)
You drank nuptial wine with him!

673
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,980
Doesn't that mean

674
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,288
you're agreeing to marry him?

675
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,700
I think he's nice.

676
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,940
Do you even know him?

677
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,740
When choosing a husband,

678
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,044
what do women look for?

679
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,220
Looks, talent,

680
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,420
family status and rank.

681
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,420
He doesn't have any of those.

682
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,940
I don't understand everything he says,

683
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,380
but I can feel

684
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,860
that he's a man of talent.

685
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,020
And he knows farming too.

686
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,220
I need someone

687
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,822
to help me take care of this garden.

688
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,780
That's all just an act.

689
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,420
You've only known him for a few days.

690
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,740
He's tricking you.

691
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,460
Tong.

692
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,740
Think about it.

693
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,820
Didn't you say

694
00:30:20,977 --> 00:30:23,088
that your litchi garden
has the best land and water?

695
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,700
Every cityman who comes here

696
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,288
wants to take it for themselves.

697
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,266
Why is it that you
trust him of all people?

698
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,660
Well, I trusted you too.

699
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,780
Aren't you also a cityman?

700
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,620
Yan Yazhuang.

701
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,820
He won't stay in Lingnan.

702
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,580
Don't forget,

703
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,333
he said it himself.

704
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,580
He has a daughter in Chang'an.

705
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,660
He also said

706
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,180
he was under imperial orders

707
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,780
to deliver litchis to Chang'an.

708
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,660
That's 2500 km from Lingnan.

709
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,380
The trip alone takes over a month.

710
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,260
His Majesty

711
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,380
wants fresh litchis.

712
00:30:48,444 --> 00:30:49,933
How's he supposed to get them there?

713
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,733
He might not even survive past June.
That's not certain at all.

714
00:30:53,422 --> 00:30:54,580
So you want to get married

715
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,660
and be widowed right after?

716
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,740
All the more reason to help him.

717
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,420
Enough.

718
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,300
You've ruined

719
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,377
our nuptial wine moment.

720
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,420
Tong!

721
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,420
Don't follow me.

722
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,060
Careful now.

723
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,020
Got it.

724
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,380
Envoy Li.

725
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,820
Envoy Li.

726
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:50,940
Why are you here?

727
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,420
Come.

728
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,900
I ran into trouble.

729
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,420
I had a boat that got seized
by Captain Yang

730
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,980
at Gaozhou Port.

731
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:04,060
When I reached the port,

732
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,740
I opened the hold.

733
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,260
There was nothing

734
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,220
inside the hold.

735
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,820
I was struck like thunder

736
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,340
and burning with panic.

737
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,180
Su,

738
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,940
no need for all the idioms.

739
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,100
Alright.

740
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,020
So,

741
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,466
that's why I came to you.

742
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,500
This?

743
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,260
You already used

744
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,060
the travel pass.

745
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:26,540
Yes.

746
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,822
Then it's non-refundable.

747
00:32:27,844 --> 00:32:28,340
Exactly.

748
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,740
And the money you gave me

749
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,140
is already safely in the pouch.

750
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,100
It's no longer yours.

751
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,020
No...

752
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,020
You didn't understand.

753
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,580
But I do understand.

754
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,100
My money

755
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,420
is already with you,

756
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,660
buried and at peace.

757
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,500
I'll never let it

758
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,500
rise from the ashes.

759
00:32:45,022 --> 00:32:46,220
Nor return it to the owner.

760
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,980
You and the Inspector's Office

761
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,500
have a lingering connection.

762
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,420
Could you help me out

763
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,180
and seduce Inspector He?

764
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,780
I just want to know

765
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,460
where my benzoin went.

766
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,700
I...

767
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,260
Even I don't have

768
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,820
that kind of connection.

769
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,900
My only tie to the Inspector...

770
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,020
My only tie to him

771
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,820
was through that travel pass.

772
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,460
And now that pass

773
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,580
is in your hands.

774
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,820
Then I've got nothing

775
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,180
to do with them anymore.

776
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,620
I really can't help.

777
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,100
You can't help?

778
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,380
So,

779
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,540
can you or can't you?

780
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,180
I can't...

781
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,340
Can help?

782
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,500
Really can't help.

783
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,580
Why not?

784
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,100
I just can't.

785
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,380
What if

786
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,660
I let more of my money

787
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,660
rest in peace with you?

788
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,060
Would you be able to help then?

789
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,020
How much?

790
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:49,940
You name a price.

791
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,820
It... It's not about the money.

792
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,660
It's just...

793
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,780
I'd really

794
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,220
love to earn money from you.

795
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,380
But I can't.

796
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,740
Why not?

797
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,220
It's just

798
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,220
hard to explain.

799
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,460
I need to focus on studying

800
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,100
the litchi transport experiment.

801
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,820
I really can't do it.

802
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,180
I just can't.

803
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,260
Can't help.

804
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,380
Can't help.

805
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,866
Chief Scribe Zhao, you're here.

806
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:29,355
Come in.

807
00:34:29,355 --> 00:34:29,860
Let me carry.

808
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,700
Thank you.

809
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,620
Where is Envoy Li?

810
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,620
Envoy Li?

811
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,580
Over there.

812
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,488
Envoy... Envoy Li.

813
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,660
Chief Scribe Zhao.

814
00:34:46,133 --> 00:34:47,420
What brings you here?

815
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,140
Envoy Li, serving His Majesty,

816
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,540
you really are hands-on.

817
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,660
My wife made some chicken soup.

818
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,644
I brought it for you to try.

819
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,820
Much appreciated.

820
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,060
Perfect timing. Let's have a talk.

821
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,060
Good.

822
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,620
Alright, here.

823
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,660
It's not easy at all.

824
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,260
Your wife is quite the cook.

825
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,940
I could smell it through the lid.

826
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,780
Really?

827
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,100
So, are you used

828
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:13,940
to Lingnan cuisine?

829
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,620
To be honest, not really.

830
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,260
Not really.

831
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,940
Understandable.

832
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,060
Envoy Li,

833
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,860
you're far from home,

834
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,800
living alone at the post station.

835
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,060
You must miss home terribly.

836
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,180
It can't be easy.

837
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,460
But didn't you already

838
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,340
set off to return to Chang'an?

839
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,780
Why come back again?

840
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,220
All of a sudden,

841
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,200
I saw a glimmer of hope.

842
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,260
And I wanted to stay

843
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,580
and study

844
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,780
the litchi transport method.

845
00:35:45,755 --> 00:35:47,644
Chief Scribe Zhao,
if you hadn't come today,

846
00:35:47,644 --> 00:35:48,990
I was just about to pay you a visit.

847
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,000
Then my timing was perfect.

848
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,740
What is it?

849
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,911
Feel free to speak openly.

850
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,740
Chief Scribe Zhao,

851
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,660
in Lingnan...

852
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,940
Do you have ice?

853
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,377
Soldiers?
[*Both 'soldiers' and 'ice' are pronounced 'bing']

854
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,540
Of course Lingnan has soldiers.

855
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,940
May I ask, Envoy Li,

856
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:12,111
what do you need soldiers for?

857
00:36:12,222 --> 00:36:13,500
To transport litchis,

858
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,500
I need ice.

859
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,500
Ah, I see.

860
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,533
Then how many soldiers do you need?

861
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,060
For the trial phase,

862
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,900
not too much.

863
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,355
But once we start actual transport,

864
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,460
the more, the better.

865
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,340
I see.

866
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,733
So are you
borrowing the soldiers, Envoy Li?

867
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,900
Well...

868
00:36:36,911 --> 00:36:38,340
I'm acting on behalf of His Majesty.

869
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,770
Shouldn't count as borrowing, right?

870
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,200
It should be a requisition.

871
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,780
It should be handed over to me.

872
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,540
Envoy Li,

873
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,355
as expected from someone from Chang'an,

874
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,620
you've seen the world.

875
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,500
No rush.

876
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,260
I'll report this to Inspector He first.

877
00:36:57,511 --> 00:36:58,866
- Thank you.
- I won't keep you.

878
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,888
Much appreciated.

879
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:00,940
Farewell.

880
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,177
What's wrong
with these Lingnan people...

881
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,580
I said long ago,

882
00:37:17,644 --> 00:37:18,820
this guy should've just been

883
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,980
cut down in one stroke.

884
00:37:20,044 --> 00:37:21,688
Keeping him around
is asking for trouble.

885
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,900
And look what happened.

886
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:23,980
My military tally

887
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,088
hasn't even arrived yet,

888
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,600
and he's already caught the scent,

889
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:27,844
taking a bite first.

890
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,700
Inspector He.

891
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,111
He invoked
His Majesty's name to request soldiers.

892
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,460
We can't refuse him.

893
00:37:36,177 --> 00:37:37,260
Here to visit you again.

894
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,100
This is...

895
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,444
Didn't you say last time
you weren't used to Lingnan food?

896
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,980
This time my wife

897
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,977
specially made
a pot of lamb soup for you.

898
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,320
Such skill.
I can smell it through the lid.

899
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,300
What about the ice?

900
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,820
But Right Chancellor
taught us something.

901
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,380
To get the military tally,

902
00:37:59,822 --> 00:38:01,577
you need to write
a letter of allegiance.

903
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,740
He wants soldiers,

904
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,622
so let's have him submit
a request for troops.

905
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,844
I'll write it right now.

906
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,340
Immediately.

907
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,100
Envoy Li,

908
00:38:11,177 --> 00:38:13,200
you really get things done quickly.

909
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,460
This day...

910
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,380
I, Li Shande,

911
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,900
regarding the matter
of transporting litchis,

912
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,180
wish to coordinate
with the Inspector He of Lingnan

913
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,020
to requisition ice.

914
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,100
Humbly ask
that Inspector He grant approval.

915
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:36,820
Respectfully.

916
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,780
Here.

917
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,420
No... Envoy Li.

918
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,400
Isn't there a mistake?

919
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,500
Soldiers?

920
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,780
I meant ice.

921
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,300
What you want is definitely

922
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,980
ice, the frozen kind?

923
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,420
I misunderstood.

924
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,980
I thought you meant

925
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,780
soldiers to escort the litchis.

926
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,340
What a misunderstanding.

927
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,220
No wonder you looked troubled yesterday.

928
00:39:08,266 --> 00:39:09,500
I didn't express myself clearly.

929
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:13,022
We haven't even solved
how to keep the litchis fresh.

930
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,222
What's the point of talking
about military escorts?

931
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,220
So...

932
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,500
About the ice,

933
00:39:17,577 --> 00:39:19,140
I'll need your help, Chief Scribe Zhao.

934
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,500
Envoy Li,

935
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,900
when it comes to ice,

936
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,940
it's going to be even harder.

937
00:39:25,755 --> 00:39:27,044
You know as well as I do,

938
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,380
Lingnan is hot and humid.

939
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,780
It's nothing like Chang'an.

940
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,733
I've never even seen ice
since I was a child.

941
00:39:32,933 --> 00:39:34,780
You could say it's harder
to find than gold.

942
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,420
Almost impossible.

943
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,780
So then wasn't my writing
all for nothing?

944
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,140
I'll just take it back.

945
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,380
Let's think of a solution together.

946
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,460
Farewell.

947
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,740
Much obliged.

948
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,180
My wife specifically told me

949
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,444
to bring the clay pot back.

950
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,460
So based on what you're saying,

951
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,380
you've come across another master.

952
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,700
And a deep one at that.

953
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:16,860
Exactly.

954
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,340
With just a few words,

955
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,020
he flipped truth and lies.

956
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,940
When I dealt with him,

957
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,060
of course,

958
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,340
we were equally matched.

959
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,977
But every move was risky.

960
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,220
I had to stay sharp,

961
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,780
respond on the spot,

962
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,260
go with the flow,

963
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,644
and speak without giving anything away.

964
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,580
Sounds like you're quite pleased,

965
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,140
thinking you and Li Shande are equals.

966
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,620
Yes.

967
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,340
Nonsense.

968
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,380
The way I see it,

969
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,540
this time around,

970
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,060
he had you utterly beat.

971
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:43,700
He didn't.

972
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,660
Oh, please.

973
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,660
Didn't Kongming once say,

974
00:40:46,688 --> 00:40:47,780
if the enemy doesn't move,

975
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,140
I won't move either.

976
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,580
If the enemy...

977
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,580
If...

978
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,977
The enemy moves, and I strike first.

979
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:55,860
Exactly.

980
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,380
He merely said the word "ice",

981
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,780
and look how flustered you got.

982
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,740
You rushed off to dig for answers.

983
00:41:01,777 --> 00:41:02,380
And the result?

984
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,980
He found out everything about us.

985
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,900
Now what am I supposed to do?

986
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,900
Do what?

987
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,380
Inspector He,

988
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,100
try this lamb soup first.

989
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,820
Yes, it must be eaten.

990
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,820
I heard the people of Chang'an

991
00:41:17,822 --> 00:41:18,860
love this kind of soup.

992
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,700
Right?

993
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,780
Very nourishing.

994
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,460
Excellent.

995
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,780
Master Konglang.

996
00:41:36,644 --> 00:41:38,420
How's the situation with the camel?

997
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,300
We've

998
00:41:40,488 --> 00:41:42,511
run into a tough one this time.

999
00:41:42,555 --> 00:41:43,780
Can't get a bite out of it.

1000
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,911
We can't afford to fail.

1001
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,377
Yes.

1002
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,860
=The Litchi Road=

1003
00:42:35,155 --> 00:42:36,220
So this deadly matter...

1004
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,260
Whose life is it?

1005
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,300
Yours.

1006
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,500
It can't be saved.

1007
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,620
You jest.

1008
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:43,860
How could that be?

1009
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,660
How could it be so sudden?

1010
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,155
I've got the kind of luck
that pulls me through

1011
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,933
when things get hopeless.

1012
00:42:51,022 --> 00:42:51,780
I won't die.

1013
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,500
I'll just pass

1014
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,460
this bad luck

1015
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,700
onto someone else.

1016
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,940
Then that person

1017
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,020
is simply unlucky,

1018
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,220
a cursed wretch,

1019
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,511
and a doomed soul.

1020
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,940
And if I give up?

1021
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,660
Master Konglang

1022
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,460
will never let you

1023
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:06,940
