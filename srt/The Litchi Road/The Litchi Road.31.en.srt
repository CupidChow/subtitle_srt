(The Trap of Candles: Two)

3
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,320
I'll definitely get...

4
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,680
what I want.

5
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,480
Sanlang,

6
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,720
the contract is due

7
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,520
tomorrow.

8
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,244
Where are the candles?

9
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,480
This is an agreement
between you and the Right Chancellor.

10
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,960
Are you going back

11
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,133
on your word?

12
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,320
Mr. Yu,

13
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,600
could you cut me some slack?

14
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,880
I'm just a minor official.

15
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,688
This deal is
between you and the Right Chancellor.

16
00:02:39,688 --> 00:02:42,040
Why ask me for leniency?

17
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,480
How funny.

18
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,760
If you don't let me off,

19
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,155
you're sending me to death.

20
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,600
Then go die.

21
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,600
Good luck.

22
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,640
Mr. Yu,

23
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,066
please show me the light.

24
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Please save me.

25
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,520
We've known each other
for quite some days.

26
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,520
Seeing you like this

27
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,400
pains me.

28
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,280
I can help you.

29
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,680
But

30
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,520
if you want to please
the Right Chancellor,

31
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,440
there are too many people

32
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,000
you'll have to get through.

33
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,320
As long as you can save my life,

34
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,511
name your price.

35
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,360
Very well.

36
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,880
If you will give me triple the interest,

37
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,200
I'll make sure you get through.

38
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,240
You're wise.

39
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,120
Chief Eunuch Wang is useless now.

40
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,120
If you join hands with me,

41
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,880
I can find you a greater opportunity.

42
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,000
Yes, Sir.

43
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,120
Attendant Yu,

44
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,800
the Right Chancellor wants to see you.

45
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,840
Greetings, Sir.

46
00:04:58,155 --> 00:04:59,888
Without using the Imperial Treasury

47
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,533
or private royal funds,

48
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,844
the debt was paid off,
including interest, in 20 days.

49
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,360
You did make good

50
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,480
your promise.

51
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,644
Well done.

52
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,680
I'm far from capable.

53
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,320
I couldn't have done this

54
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,680
on my own

55
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,577
without your support and guidance.

56
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,355
Thank you, Sir.

57
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,920
I'd like to recommend someone

58
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,880
as the sole

59
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,155
candle supplier.

60
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,840
Thank you, Sir.

61
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,880
From now on,

62
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,560
candles

63
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,333
will be part of the annual
palace procurement.

64
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,866
I'm counting on you.

65
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,360
Yes, Sir.

66
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,160
Thank you for saving our lives,

67
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,644
Attendant Yu.

68
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,040
Thank you for saving our lives,
Attendant Yu.

69
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,400
Don't you resent me

70
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,577
for making so much money off of you?

71
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,800
You earned it fairly

72
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,160
and wisely.

73
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,888
I'm truly convinced.

74
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,711
Unlike Chief Eunuch Wang,
who took bribes.

75
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,880
I thought you wouldn't
take our deal seriously.

76
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,640
I never imagined
you'd actually recommend me

77
00:07:37,644 --> 00:07:38,800
to the Right Chancellor.

78
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,800
I'm impressed.

79
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,560
From now on,

80
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,720
you'll be the most respected man

81
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,760
of all Baiwang people in Chang'an.

82
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,320
- Aye, aye!
- Aye, aye!

83
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,540
=Episode 31=

84
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,600
The winds in Lingnan

85
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,000
are going to shift.

86
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,920
It's rainy season.

87
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,320
The weather changes a lot.

88
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,088
The shifts are normal.

89
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,080
I really like

90
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,960
your carefree attitude.

91
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,880
I'm talking about the local tyrant

92
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,400
and the inspector.

93
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,920
Something big is coming.

94
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,760
Have you figured

95
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,760
anything out?

96
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,720
Look.

97
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,720
Li Shande

98
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,000
gave Amita the identity

99
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,955
as the Hu merchants' representative.

100
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,400
That ties them together.

101
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,680
Ma Guiyun

102
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,680
and Master Konglang

103
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,733
are on the same side.

104
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,480
And Ma Guiyun and Li Shande

105
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,222
have a complicated relationship.

106
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,360
Anyway,

107
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,200
they're all against

108
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,577
He Youguang.

109
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,160
Everyone around him has left.

110
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,080
Dear,

111
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,444
you should make plans, too.

112
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,040
With your talent,

113
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,844
you'll be in demand anywhere.

114
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,000
No rush.

115
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,400
There's still one person
I haven't figured out.

116
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,520
Inspector Yu from Chang'an.

117
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,760
No matter how He Youguang

118
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,840
tries to fawn over him,

119
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,040
he ignores him

120
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,720
and refuses his gifts.

121
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,444
But my hunch tells me

122
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,200
he's not after money.

123
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,560
As for

124
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,240
what he truly wants,

125
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,066
I'll need to observe.

126
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,720
He Youguang

127
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,333
killed Amita's father.

128
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,560
I didn't expect such a story
in Lingnan.

129
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,488
Li Shande definitely knows.

130
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,760
He seems honest and timid,

131
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,560
but he dares to stand up for Amita

132
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,044
in front of the Right Chancellor.

133
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,000
He probably didn't expect

134
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,680
to get caught in all this

135
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,266
just by being sent here to pick litchis.

136
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,880
I was worried

137
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,977
I wouldn't get to handle one thing

138
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,022
while in Lingnan.

139
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,360
Surprisingly,

140
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,044
they've already started
turning against each other.

141
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,320
In that case,

142
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,800
should we stir the water even muddier?

143
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,644
You're learning well.

144
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,560
All my teachings haven't gone to waste.

145
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,422
You're dismissed.

146
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,560
I'm about to tell

147
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,266
another touching story.

148
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,040
I did a divination this morning.

149
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,040
Strong wind blows,

150
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,244
and something's coming.

151
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,640
Turns out

152
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,466
it's you city folks.

153
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,640
I came all the way here to hide

154
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,177
and still can't find peace.

155
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,560
Great Shaman Cai,

156
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,000
we're Tong's friends.

157
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,160
We came here

158
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,280
to ask you something.

159
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,680
Didn't you find

160
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,640
that path already?

161
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,200
What more do you want to know?

162
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,280
Great Shaman Cai,

163
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,760
before Tu died,

164
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,920
he said he had evidence

165
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,466
that He Youguang killed Haihu.

166
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,155
Do you have it?

167
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,640
If I had something that important,

168
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,111
I would've given it to you.

169
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,244
Great Shaman,

170
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,880
we know

171
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,000
you and Tu were lovers.

172
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,866
He wouldn't have lied to you.

173
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,800
Please think again.

174
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,933
Perhaps there's a clue you overlooked.

175
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,360
I used to think

176
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,280
I was important to him.

177
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Turns out

178
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,240
men's hearts

179
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,466
can be crueler than jackals.

180
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,720
He sent something back once.

181
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,760
It was some herbs

182
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,120
for his family.

183
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,688
Nothing for me.

184
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,960
Not even a word.

185
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,640
I've thought it through.

186
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,800
The relationship

187
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,880
between us

188
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,800
was only one-sided.

189
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:11,955
Are you sure he didn't
leave anything for you?

190
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,244
Could it be you just missed it?

191
00:15:15,422 --> 00:15:16,840
Are you saying that on purpose

192
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,688
to upset me?

193
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,920
You city folks

194
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,680
are noisy.

195
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,720
Stop disturbing me.

196
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,720
Leave at once.

197
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,360
Go.

198
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,680
Great Shaman Cai.

199
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,960
Haihu was my father.

200
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,666
I was a kid when he was killed.

201
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:41,088
I was raised by the one who killed him.

202
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,720
That's why the evidence
means a lot to me.

203
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,711
Back then, the fire at Qijing Pavilion

204
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,160
brought down the Sea Sail Fund.

205
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,120
It not only ruined Tu's life

206
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,480
but also tore many families apart.

207
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,560
The evidence Tu left behind

208
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,760
can prove

209
00:15:56,377 --> 00:15:58,488
that He Youguang was behind it all.

210
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,680
Not only do I wish
to clear my father's name,

211
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,222
but I also want to seek justice
for those who suffered.

212
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,755
This is the box

213
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,960
he sent back.

214
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,840
Try checking it.

215
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,480
See if you can find anything.

216
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,311
What can we get from this?

217
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,160
I told you.

218
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,720
He Youguang also killed Tu.

219
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:51,200
Why would I keep anything

220
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,240
from you?

221
00:16:56,688 --> 00:16:57,800
You said there were herbs

222
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,066
inside this box?

223
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,000
Yes.

224
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,688
Were they special herbs?

225
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,920
Not at all.

226
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,680
They were common herbs

227
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,666
you can find everywhere in Mount Dayu.

228
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,440
It was strange to me.

229
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,840
It wasn't easy to send back a box

230
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,222
at that time.

231
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,222
But there wasn't
anything rare or valuable.

232
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,088
This is strange.

233
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,644
This isn't a medicine box.

234
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,444
It's a documented case used on ships.

235
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,155
It's designed
to resist water and moisture.

236
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:28,960
What?

237
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,466
Could someone have tampered with it?

238
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,320
Tong.

239
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,640
Where's Mr. Su?

240
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,800
He said he'd be coming with you today.

241
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,760
He...

242
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,880
He saw

243
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,640
I was busy

244
00:17:54,155 --> 00:17:55,800
and didn't want to disturb me.

245
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,440
That can't be.

246
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,440
He said today's your birthday

247
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,800
and even prepared a gift for you.

248
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,880
I can't believe he remembered that.

249
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,311
He won't be coming.

250
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,000
We had a conflict.

251
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,680
What happened?

252
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,920
I broke a promise

253
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
I made to him.

254
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,866
Then you should explain yourself.

255
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,911
You're right.

256
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,600
I should.

257
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,480
Right.

258
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,920
People say businessmen
only care about profit.

259
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,200
But Mr. Su

260
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,840
really treats you as a friend.

261
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,600
He prepared the Hu gift

262
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,480
long ago,

263
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,880
not just because

264
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,022
you're famous now.

265
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,120
If Mr. Su won't be coming,

266
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,000
I prepared a gift for you too.

267
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:04,080
This is the biggest litchi

268
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,040
grown in the garden.

269
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,120
We call it Dan Litchi.

270
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,533
Only one grows each year.

271
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,440
It's said eating it
can prolong your life,

272
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,022
so I saved it especially for you.

273
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,400
The biggest one?

274
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,711
I can present it as a tribute, then.

275
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:21,866
There are plenty of litchis.
If you don't eat it, I'll give it to others.

276
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:23,440
I didn't say I wouldn't eat it.

277
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,080
I...

278
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,600
Thank you, Miss Tong.

279
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
What for?

280
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,120
That's what friends do.

281
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:35,333
Even though you forgot to
bring me liquor,

282
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,311
I'm still willing to give you
a Dan Litchi.

283
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,320
It's all of you

284
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,400
who pulled me out of the mire

285
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,840
so that I could follow
this sliver of hope

286
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,800
and move forward.

287
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,280
Now,

288
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,240
the litchi transport

289
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,311
is no longer just about me.

290
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,600
Only if it succeeds can I live up

291
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,520
to your expectations

292
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,200
and repay all your kindness.

293
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,520
Tong,

294
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,600
are there

295
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,288
enough litchis in the garden?

296
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,622
Yes. I've kept them for you.

297
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,840
But if you want to

298
00:20:11,866 --> 00:20:14,066
cut off half of the branches

299
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,520
for transport,

300
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,311
it'll ruin the trees.

301
00:20:17,377 --> 00:20:18,320
I know.

302
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,960
When the time comes,

303
00:20:20,555 --> 00:20:23,066
we won't need many trees.

304
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,280
It won't affect

305
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,280
your harvest.

306
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,400
I'll ask His Majesty

307
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,480
to reward you.

308
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,355
Well, then.

309
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,688
I'll let you off this time.

310
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:34,800
Try it.

311
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,640
A desperate try

312
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,333
isn't just for myself

313
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,920
but for everyone's passion.

314
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,280
That's what friends

315
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,044
should be like.

316
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,160
Lan,

317
00:20:56,911 --> 00:20:58,888
please lend me a few more guan of money.

318
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,240
I really need it.

319
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,400
Didn't I just lend you some

320
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,800
a few days ago?

321
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,822
How are you out already?

322
00:21:08,911 --> 00:21:10,866
I've got a lot of expenses,

323
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,480
medicine,

324
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,520
food,

325
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,533
and liquor.

326
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,400
Also,

327
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,960
I have to provide for my lover.

328
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,133
Aren't you sick?

329
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,239
It doesn't seem
to be affecting you much.

330
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,720
Oh, come on.

331
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,088
Medicine can treat illness,

332
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,000
but it can't ease the pain.

333
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,000
Lan,

334
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,840
you don't know how bad it gets

335
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,560
at night.

336
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,888
I just need something

337
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,200
to help me forget.

338
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,640
Be honest with me.

339
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,000
You went gambling again, didn't you?

340
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,160
I just thought

341
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,200
I shouldn't keep asking you for money,

342
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,511
so I tried a few rounds.

343
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,960
You never learn your lesson.

344
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,111
Lan.

345
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,760
Lan.

346
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,480
Look at me.

347
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,488
I'm old, frail,

348
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,066
and have no way to earn.

349
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,960
Back then,

350
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,266
I played Madiao with your father,

351
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,160
and no one could beat me.

352
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,000
That's only because

353
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,422
no one knew you had lazy eyes.

354
00:22:21,422 --> 00:22:23,688
That's why you could see everyone's card
without hiding.

355
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:25,488
Do you really want me to bring this up?

356
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,120
Lan,

357
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,555
the fortune-teller said

358
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,400
I'd strike luck after hardship.

359
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,520
The more I lose, the luckier I'll get.

360
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,120
So I wanted to test my luck.

361
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,760
All right.

362
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I won't gamble anymore.

363
00:22:41,866 --> 00:22:43,733
Please lend me two more guan of money.

364
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
I need it to buy medicine.

365
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:46,720
Lan.

366
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,000
Inspector He is here.

367
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,320
Wait for me.

368
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,577
Watch over him.

369
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,622
Guai.

370
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:10,800
Nice to meet you, Guai.

371
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,222
Chicken Daddy.

372
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,360
Lan.

373
00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:21,555
I'll go check on my chickens.

374
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,311
We'll chat later.

375
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,911
Zhao. You go ahead and talk.

376
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,360
I'm coming.

377
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,244
The chickens aren't ready yet.

378
00:23:29,311 --> 00:23:30,644
Why is he here so early?

379
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,666
Inspector He's here with a guest today.

380
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:33,600
Who is it?

381
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,977
Someone from Chang'an.

382
00:23:35,266 --> 00:23:36,000
From the palace.

383
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,466
Pick a few gamecocks

384
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,520
and make sure

385
00:23:40,644 --> 00:23:43,000
the one the guest bet on wins
after a long fight.

386
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,933
Make it a tough match.

387
00:23:45,577 --> 00:23:47,733
Don't let him win too easily, right?

388
00:23:47,755 --> 00:23:48,320
That's right.

389
00:23:50,288 --> 00:23:51,400
Thank you for the trouble.

390
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,911
Where's he?

391
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,440
He slipped off

392
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,720
right after you left.

393
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,240
He ran off

394
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,311
like a rat.

395
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:08,920
I thought

396
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,022
you yelled at him and scared him off.

397
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,333
If he were scared of me,

398
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,177
would he dare come borrow money
without shame?

399
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,440
No.

400
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,280
No.

401
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,720
This won't do.

402
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,800
This one is better.

403
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,480
Inspector He,

404
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:27,840
your guest has arrived.

405
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,040
He's here.

406
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,040
Inspector He, Chief Scribe Zhao.

407
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:31,880
Come.

408
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,377
These two are the best gamecocks here.

409
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,040
Pick one.

410
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,720
I'll take this.

411
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,822
Then I'll go with this.

412
00:24:45,822 --> 00:24:46,530
All right.

413
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,200
Inspector He.

414
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,000
I only came here

415
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,920
to check on the progress
of the litchi transport

416
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,160
on behalf of Inspector Yu.

417
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,920
Why invite me to a game?

418
00:25:01,088 --> 00:25:01,720
Have a seat.

419
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,244
Please have a seat, Inspector He.

420
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,822
In Lingnan, things aren't like
they are in Chang'an.

421
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,555
We have our own ways
of doing things here.

422
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,480
When on duty,

423
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,560
one must give it their all.

424
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,800
But once the duty is done,
they should enjoy themselves.

425
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,200
Only by enjoying well

426
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,840
can they serve well again.

427
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,800
Zhao,

428
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,422
what's that saying again?

429
00:25:29,466 --> 00:25:30,155
What's it again?

430
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,800
"Go with the local flow."

431
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,960
Go with the local flow.

432
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,866
Fair enough, Inspector He.

433
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,160
What's going on?

434
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,280
The results will be out soon.

435
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,311
The Black Phoenix won.

436
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,177
The next round is about to begin.

437
00:25:50,355 --> 00:25:52,288
Place your bets.

438
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,288
Congratulations.

439
00:25:59,400 --> 00:25:59,960
Inspector He,

440
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,400
Inspector Yu always tells me

441
00:26:02,488 --> 00:26:04,355
not to take rewards
without contribution.

442
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,720
I'm afraid

443
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,920
I can't accept this.

444
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,266
Heaven determines everyone's fate.

445
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,000
If wealth is meant for you,

446
00:26:15,022 --> 00:26:16,733
you can't avoid it, no matter how.

447
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,320
You earn this

448
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,800
yourself.

449
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,640
You deserve it.

450
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,280
Come.

451
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,280
Take this.

452
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,320
It's getting late.

453
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,760
I should return

454
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,440
and report to Inspector Yu.

455
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,240
If I'm late,

456
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,280
I'll be punished.

457
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,555
There's something

458
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,222
I've been meaning to say.

459
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,560
Since arriving in Lingnan,

460
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,711
Inspector Yu has spared no effort

461
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,440
on the litchi transport

462
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,880
as decreed by His Majesty,

463
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,240
and he then fell sick.

464
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,840
How about this?

465
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,120
I'll return with you

466
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,377
and pay him a visit. What do you think?

467
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,720
Inspector He,

468
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,444
let's not pretend.

469
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,440
Inspector Yu isn't ill.

470
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,577
He simply refuses to accept your gifts.

471
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,844
How is that a gift?

472
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,840
It's a token

473
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,120
of my sincerity.

474
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,880
Is that wrong?

475
00:27:23,422 --> 00:27:25,360
Inspector Yu keeps you at arm's length

476
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,680
because he doesn't want to get involved
with you.

477
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,360
He wants to seek

478
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,400
his own path to fortune.

479
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,960
There are countless

480
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,844
of them.

481
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,920
I wonder which one

482
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,920
he has chosen.

483
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,840
Inspector Yu heard about

484
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,920
the Sea Sail Fund in Lingnan

485
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,688
and seemed interested.

486
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,920
He said

487
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,422
it's a golden business
to earn money.

488
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,400
Inspector Yu knows a thing or two

489
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,577
about the Sea Sail Fund.

490
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,666
Yes, he did.

491
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,080
He also mentioned

492
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,320
that Mr. Li

493
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,960
once ran a transport trial in Lingnan,

494
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,640
and everyone knew it.

495
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,800
His influence

496
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,480
is no less than Haihu.

497
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,644
Once His Majesty tastes
the litchis from Gaozhou,

498
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,720
they'll be sought after

499
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,888
throughout the entire country.

500
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
If the Litchi Fund

501
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,800
could be issued early,

502
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,400
the profits would be immeasurable.

503
00:28:47,711 --> 00:28:49,240
I expect nothing less

504
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,280
from Inspector Yu.

505
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,080
He's indeed

506
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,822
the Right Chancellor's trusted aide.

507
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,080
He's been here just days,

508
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,040
yet already has such clever insight.

509
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,822
He can observe from high above
and control everything.

510
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,222
As expected of
the "Softshell Turtle On Top".

511
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,840
Seems like you don't know

512
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,320
where that name comes from.

513
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:11,840
Do tell.

514
00:29:12,977 --> 00:29:14,288
In the far east of Penglai,

515
00:29:14,311 --> 00:29:16,390
a giant softshell turtle
was once offered as tribute.

516
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,160
It went berserk
and bit two men to death.

517
00:29:18,266 --> 00:29:21,177
After investigation, those two
were found to be corrupt officials.

518
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,200
His Majesty brought
the Noble Consort there

519
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,960
and inscribed:

520
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,280
"Turtles outlive tortoises.

521
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,880
They tell loyalists from traitors,

522
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,600
good from evil."

523
00:29:34,955 --> 00:29:36,577
At that time, the Right Chancellor

524
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,422
had just brought Inspector Yu
into the palace.

525
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,080
Upon hearing this,

526
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,720
Inspector Yu knelt and said,

527
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,400
"I shall be Your Majesty's turtle,

528
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,733
praying for the long life
of the Emperor and Noble Consort.

529
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,800
Inside and outside the palace,

530
00:29:51,266 --> 00:29:53,511
I will punish the evil
and purge them all."

531
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,800
His Majesty was greatly pleased.

532
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,400
From then on,

533
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,400
he was given the name
"Softshell Turtle On Top".

534
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,160
Inspector He,

535
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,760
I'm only saying this

536
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:20,644
because of the rewards.

537
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,720
In Chang'an,

538
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,880
if Inspector Yu points a finger,

539
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,711
the person he accuses
is undoubtedly a traitor.

540
00:30:30,466 --> 00:30:31,866
I shall take my leave.

541
00:30:48,777 --> 00:30:50,688
- Mr. Ma, you're here.
- Mr. Ma.

542
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:55,577
Has Lazy Eye Feng come here lately?

543
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,160
He has.

544
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,977
I saw him yesterday.

545
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,266
Chief Scribe Zhao,

546
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,080
you asked me
to keep an eye on Amita.

547
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,400
I found out

548
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,360
she's been looking for someone

549
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,022
named Lazy Eye Feng.

550
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,520
He lied to us.

551
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,440
The evidence Tu had

552
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,600
is likely in his hands now.

553
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,622
Lazy Eye Feng?

554
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,755
That name rings a bell.

555
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,911
Have you found him?

556
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:23,088
What does he want with the evidence?

557
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,360
He's hoping

558
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,160
to cash in one day,

559
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,320
either by selling them to He Youguang

560
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,400
or his enemies

561
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,733
for money.

562
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,160
He's such a fool.

563
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,280
He Youguang is ruthless.

564
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,240
Holding onto the evidence

565
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,320
will only get him killed.

566
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,911
Lan, please look for him.

567
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,440
Lan,

568
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,288
by seniority,

569
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,800
I'm your uncle.

570
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,977
How can you treat me like this?

571
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,640
Then why were you avoiding me?

572
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,600
Of course I had to.

573
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,080
You're always so fierce with me.

574
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,644
You don't respect me at all.

575
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,200
Stop beating around the bush.

576
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,688
Tell me. Is Tu's evidence with you?

577
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,680
Tu? Evidence?

578
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,600
Didn't I tell you everything

579
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,480
I know?

580
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,800
Still playing dumb, huh?

581
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,400
Tu died with a grievance,

582
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,311
and He Youguang still walks free.

583
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,920
If you had any conscience,

584
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,880
you'd hand the evidence over.

585
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,000
Aren't you afraid Tu's ghost

586
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,066
will come find you?

587
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,480
If he does, that'd be wonderful.

588
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,360
I won't live much longer.

589
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,200
I'd love to catch up on old times
with him

590
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,120
and ask him about...

591
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,800
Lazy Eye Feng,

592
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,360
who switched the contents

593
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,444
inside the box?

594
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,520
Tu specifically asked you

595
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,155
to run something back home.

596
00:33:15,177 --> 00:33:16,240
He couldn't have asked you

597
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,879
to deliver herbs from his own home.

598
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,311
Well...

599
00:33:18,377 --> 00:33:19,022
Guai.

600
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,640
Uncle Feng,

601
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,320
I gave you money every time you asked.

602
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,080
Why do you

603
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,244
have to be so greedy?

604
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,000
I know

605
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,488
you look down on me.

606
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:42,866
You think I live like a useless mess.

607
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,640
But I wasn't like this

608
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,044
when I first came to Lingnan.

609
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,560
Back then, my mother

610
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,760
sold her dowry jewelry

611
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
to gather money for me.

612
00:33:54,155 --> 00:33:56,488
I swore I'd make something of myself
in Lingnan

613
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,000
and bring honor to the family.

614
00:33:59,088 --> 00:34:02,822
I didn't expect that to happen...

615
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,133
I'm a victim, too.

616
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,177
When my parents died,

617
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,533
I was too ashamed to go back.

618
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,520
They must've thought

619
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,044
they raised an unfilial son.

620
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,733
Uncle Feng.

621
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,244
Letters from your home looking for you

622
00:34:31,533 --> 00:34:32,840
were sent to me.

623
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,800
I told them

624
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,844
you were doing great here

625
00:34:38,222 --> 00:34:40,044
and helping me run the business.

626
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,600
I also sent money home in your name.

627
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,840
At least in their eyes,

628
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,533
you still had some dignity.

629
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,480
Lan, thank you.

630
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,888
You and your father are good people.

631
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,120
Lan,

632
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,088
you came too late.

633
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,160
I needed money

634
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,600
to leave Lingnan,

635
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,711
so I sold the evidence.

636
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,080
To whom?

637
00:35:11,555 --> 00:35:14,888
He used to be a broker
for the Sea Sail Fund.

638
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:20,622
Now, he's the chief scribe
in the Inspector's Office,

639
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,288
Zhao Xinmin.

640
00:35:27,422 --> 00:35:29,311
We were so close to
getting the evidence,

641
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,080
but Zhao Xinmin was ahead of us.

642
00:35:31,577 --> 00:35:32,800
Do you think he'll hand it over

643
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,155
to He Youguang?

644
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,400
I heard ever since Inspector Yu
came to Lingnan,

645
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,422
he's been giving He Youguang
a hard time.

646
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:41,840
Right.

647
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,480
No matter how big

648
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,844
the gifts He Youguang offers,

649
00:35:44,888 --> 00:35:46,155
he's shut out.

650
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,520
Zhao Xinmin is smart.

651
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,040
Surely, he can tell

652
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,688
Inspector Yu didn't come in peace.

653
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,200
Until things become clear,

654
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:55,840
he won't

655
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,466
take sides easily,

656
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,377
let alone let anyone rope him in.

657
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,000
So he's keeping

658
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,640
the evidence

659
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,711
for himself.

660
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,066
Zhao,

661
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,022
sit down and have a drink with me.

662
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,022
Thank you.

663
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,911
Thank you for offering a drink, Sir.

664
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,520
Zhao,

665
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,120
it must've been tough for you

666
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:22,177
working under me all these years.

667
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,840
I know I have

668
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,040
a bad temper.

669
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,800
I'm always shouting at you.

670
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,644
Please bear with me.

671
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:33,840
Let's drink.

672
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,160
Sure.

673
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,422
Cheers.

674
00:36:43,177 --> 00:36:44,133
Let me pour for you.

675
00:36:44,222 --> 00:36:45,044
I wouldn't dare.

676
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,022
Let me do it.

677
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,840
Do you know why

678
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,760
I always

679
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,720
scold you?

680
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,222
Because I see you as one of us.

681
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:56,560
Yes.

682
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,360
Over the years,

683
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,933
you've run all the affairs

684
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,866
in the Inspector's Office.

685
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,800
I know

686
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,933
how much you've done.

687
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,355
But you've also been
pocketing benefits.

688
00:37:10,422 --> 00:37:11,839
I know everything.

689
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,688
Don't try to lie.

690
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:13,977
Oh, don't tease me, Sir.

691
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,155
I didn't.

692
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,422
I truly see you as my friend.

693
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,155
Sir.

694
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,760
I'm honored

695
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,977
you say that.

696
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,200
How time flies.

697
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,520
You've been by my side

698
00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:44,822
for so many years.

699
00:37:46,488 --> 00:37:47,879
Do you still remember

700
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,777
how you came to me?

701
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,200
I'll never forget it.

702
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,480
Back then,

703
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,222
I was just a broker

704
00:38:01,244 --> 00:38:03,044
for the Sea Sail Fund.

705
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,240
I was ambitious

706
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,555
but had no opportunities.

707
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:11,155
At that time,
the Sea Sail Fund collapsed.

708
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,520
If you hadn't taken me in,

709
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,844
I wouldn't be where I am today.

710
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,520
I remember you told me

711
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:23,920
that sharp judgment
and firm determination are important

712
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,155
when dealing with matters.

713
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,960
I kept those words close

714
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,377
and constantly reflected on them.

715
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,200
Right.

716
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,866
Glad you remember.

717
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,040
Lately,

718
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,311
something has been troubling me.

719
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,555
But in all of Lingnan,

720
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,440
there's no one

721
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,080
I can open up to.

722
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,666
Only you, Zhao.

723
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,480
No one but you understand me.

724
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,000
Lingnan

725
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,800
is getting more and more unstable.

726
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,440
Scoundrels

727
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,155
are popping their heads
one after another.

728
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,760
Amita

729
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,880
is coming at me

730
00:39:18,311 --> 00:39:20,666
with the Right Chancellor backing her.

731
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,200
Li Shande isn't what he once was.

732
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,333
If he manages to transport litchis
to Chang'an,

733
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,760
he won't go easy on me.

734
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,200
And those fickle-minded Hu merchants

735
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,888
don't listen to me anymore.

736
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,400
Even Inspector Yu

737
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,688
is planning to issue a Litchi Fund.

738
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,520
Those scoundrels

739
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,488
are determined to hold us down.

740
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,466
They're not after money.

741
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,911
They want our lives.

742
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,600
Everything looks the same

743
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,155
in Lingnan,

744
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,400
but the hearts have changed.

745
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,320
Sometimes,

746
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,244
even I wonder

747
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,920
if you're still

748
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,200
loyal to me.

749
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,933
A man dies for the one
who knows his worth.

750
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,560
I'm willing to give my life

751
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,688
for you, Sir.

752
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,777
Zhao, I appreciate that.

753
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,577
I'm lucky to have a trusted aide
like you.

754
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,400
I trust you, Zhao.

755
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,720
If Inspector Yu

756
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,622
issues a Litchi Fund,

757
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,755
then so will we.

758
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,022
You want to stand up to him?

759
00:40:58,044 --> 00:40:59,920
That's right.

760
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,377
I'll confront head-to-head with him.

761
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,760
Zhao, think about it.

762
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,960
Over the years,

763
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,400
how many profits

764
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,444
have we funneled
to the Right Chancellor?

765
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,533
But he's never satisfied.

766
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,920
He sends a eunuch

767
00:41:13,133 --> 00:41:15,600
who's imperious
and has insatiable greed.

768
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,466
What is this?

769
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,066
So don't worry. Do it boldly.

770
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,377
If anything happens, I have your back.

771
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,911
I have the military tally.

772
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,600
No one can stop me.

773
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,280
Sir,

774
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,022
we've never been able

775
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,155
to be involved in the Litchi Fund.

776
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,288
If Inspector Yu sends out a notice

777
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,377
warning the people of the risks,

778
00:41:40,422 --> 00:41:42,933
those bonds will collapse instantly.

779
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,000
Would he dare?

780
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,711
I don't think he has the guts.

781
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,200
And if he really does that,

782
00:41:49,244 --> 00:41:50,511
causing chaos in Lingnan,

783
00:41:50,866 --> 00:41:52,511
can he bear the consequences?

784
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,640
If he declares

785
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,200
the Litchi Fund violates the Tang's law

786
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,822
and confiscates all the money,

787
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,400
Lingnan will fall into chaos,

788
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,311
and you'll have to take the blame.

789
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:05,577
Things should be handled with patience.

790
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,360
Be patient...

791
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,577
This can't wait.

792
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,688
We must end this once and for all.

793
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,200
Whether you do it or not,

794
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,960
there will be consequences.

795
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,555
There's no point waiting to die.

796
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:16,840
Also,

797
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,880
while we're at it,

798
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,760
lure these scoundrels out
for a negotiation

799
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,622
in person.

800
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,911
If it works out, that's great.

801
00:42:24,977 --> 00:42:27,822
If not, finish them.

802
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,266
End everything once and for all.

803
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,160
I don't believe

804
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,666
I can't handle them.

805
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,260
=The Litchi Road=

806
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,533
Only Mr. Su

807
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,266
has double-layered jars?

808
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:43,022
Yes, only he has them.

809
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,688
I want to see Mr. Li!

810
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,920
Take them all away.

811
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,933
Let me see Mr. Li!

812
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,088
Seal the city.

813
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,160
Tonight,

814
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,755
no one and no news

815
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,600
should leave Lingnan.

816
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,088
I, Li Shande, the Litchi Envoy,

817
00:43:02,133 --> 00:43:03,977
greet you, Admiral.

818
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,960
Tonight, we shall see

819
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,622
