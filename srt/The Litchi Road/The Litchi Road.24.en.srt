00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,999
=The Litchi Road=

2
00:01:40,071 --> 00:01:40,870
(Blood Bird's Nest)

3
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,590
Right Chancellor.

4
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,950
Have a taste of this fresh

5
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,200
Lingnan blood bird's nest.

6
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,150
The Hu merchants said

7
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,466
the voyages went far this year,

8
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,580
and luck was on their side.

9
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,066
Hence, these are top-grade goods.

10
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,600
Are the ones for the palace ready?

11
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,510
How is the quality?

12
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,040
All are prepared.

13
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,777
Same as what you're tasting.

14
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,644
Have them swapped.

15
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:26,800
Replace them with ones
similar to last year's quality.

16
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,750
That'll do.

17
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,710
This year,

18
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,577
this is indeed a top grade.

19
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,911
But if we can't keep it up next year,

20
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,111
what then?

21
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,710
Serving His Majesty

22
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,288
requires not only excellence,

23
00:02:46,577 --> 00:02:49,200
but also stability.

24
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:51,466
Right Chancellor,

25
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,190
His Majesty's favorite peony bush

26
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,777
has sprouted.

27
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,533
It's recovering nicely.

28
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,511
Good.

29
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,750
Remember,

30
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,840
this is what truly

31
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,444
deserves our full attention.

32
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:08,590
=Episode 24=

33
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,080
Sister, you don't need to worry.

34
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,870
On the first day of June,

35
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,030
he will live.

36
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,680
You're one of his people,

37
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,710
of course, you'd speak for him.

38
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,240
From now till the first day,

39
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,840
there are plenty

40
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,240
of uncertainties.

41
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,750
Why should I worry

42
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,080
day after day,

43
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,630
and be entwined in his fate?

44
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,630
That sip of tea you just took

45
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,044
got your lipstick smudged.

46
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,960
When it comes to doing business,

47
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,755
you can't just
focus on short-term gains.

48
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,030
You need to think long-term.

49
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,470
If you seize the right opportunity,

50
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,266
the rest of your life could be set.

51
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,080
If I were you,

52
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,910
I'd do everything I could

53
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,040
to persuade your patron

54
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,040
to spend just a mere 150 guan

55
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,111
in exchange
for a big favor from Li Shande.

56
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,310
Once Li Shande

57
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,800
completes the litchi transport,

58
00:04:25,088 --> 00:04:26,577
with the kind of man he is,

59
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,777
he's bound to remember your kindness.

60
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,240
That's the kind of favor

61
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,430
that no amount of money

62
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,800
couldn't buy later.

63
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,750
And if he fails?

64
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,800
Then, of course,
he'll return the money to you.

65
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,870
Because before he dies,

66
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,630
he'll definitely want to
ensure the safety

67
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,750
of his child.

68
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,920
So no matter what happens,

69
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,160
your patron

70
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,070
won't lose out.

71
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,630
Stop right there!

72
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,680
Don't run! Stop right there!

73
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,040
I said stop!

74
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,120
Where's my child?

75
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,120
Where's my child?

76
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,190
Calm down.

77
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,160
When I asked you to pay back the loan,

78
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,950
didn't you tell me not to rush?

79
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,070
I paid the loan before the date,

80
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,560
didn't I?

81
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,390
And I already promised you

82
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,430
I'd pay you the rest

83
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,920
on the first day of June.

84
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,430
What more do you want?

85
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,270
I want you to pay me now.

86
00:05:29,511 --> 00:05:31,510
I heard you went
to get the approval today.

87
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,920
Any good news to share with me?

88
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,870
Getting that approval isn't so easy.

89
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,600
You've got to run around

90
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
to all the offices,

91
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,070
and spend a few days
smoothing things out.

92
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,510
I've only been back a day.

93
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,680
Don't worry.

94
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,800
I will definitely

95
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,480
get the approval.

96
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,190
I'll pay you back too.

97
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,390
And I'll get the job done.

98
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,240
Alright? Trust me.

99
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,360
Someone already gave me advice.

100
00:06:04,222 --> 00:06:05,830
Mr. Li, you're quite the lucky man.

101
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,040
You found yourself a good one.

102
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,160
Don't worry.

103
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:12,400
I won't make things hard for you.

104
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,750
But I also need

105
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
to give my patron

106
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,630
an answer.

107
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,560
So now that you're back,

108
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,750
I need something to put me at ease.

109
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,510
Otherwise,

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,270
I won't let you

111
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,360
leave Chang'an again.

112
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,240
Got it.

113
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,222
(Pingkang Ward)
Move it back there.

114
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:39,600
The gates are about to close!

115
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,830
Hurry! Hurry!

116
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,240
Stop dragging your feet! Move!

117
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,680
Who told you

118
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,933
to take her to them today?

119
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,120
Who told you?

120
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:53,360
Wait.

121
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,360
If the child gets hurt,

122
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,622
can you take responsibility?

123
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,270
I was outnumbered.

124
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,830
I couldn't go head-to-head with them.

125
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm a merchant.

126
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,310
I know how they operate.

127
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:04,133
Besides, it was just 100 guan.

128
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:05,160
Just 100 guan?

129
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,160
Just 100 guan?

130
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,720
That's because you and the kid

131
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,430
got lucky!

132
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,933
Do you know where you are?

133
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,070
You think you call the shots here?

134
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,600
Where every deal

135
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,390
is worth thousands

136
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
of guan?

137
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,510
This is Chang'an! Chang'an, you hear?

138
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:19,911
It's a mix of all kinds of people,
crooks and lords alike.

139
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:20,560
That 100 guan...

140
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,120
Where are you going? Hey!

141
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,600
There are 108 wards in Chang'an.

142
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,577
Where are you going?

143
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,070
This way.

144
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,560
Back there! Move it.

145
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,644
You want to get out or not?

146
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,240
Mr. Zhang.

147
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,830
Can you help me keep an eye on the kid?

148
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:08,510
Sure.

149
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,120
Father, where are you going?

150
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,733
I'm going to buy you some food.

151
00:08:12,644 --> 00:08:13,990
Go help Mrs. Zhang pick vegetables.

152
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,920
Come on, Xiu'er.

153
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:15,830
Sit right here.

154
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,800
Good girl, Xiu'er.

155
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,390
Last night,

156
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,240
I had a dream.

157
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,120
I dreamt of Li Shande.

158
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,840
He was in Chang'an,

159
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,440
smiling at me.

160
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,466
Inspector He.

161
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,390
Don't be upset.

162
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,670
It's not worth harming your health

163
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,440
over this.

164
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,120
All our efforts went down the drain.

165
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,550
Chief Scribe Zhao.

166
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,240
Didn't you always think

167
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,150
you were sharp and clever?

168
00:08:58,266 --> 00:09:00,111
Smarter than everyone else?

169
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,222
Honestly, the chicken is smarter.

170
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
Where is he?

171
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:22,933
Go search. Hunt him down.

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,630
Find him.

173
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,870
Or I'll skin you alive.

174
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,030
So, the chicken is smarter?

175
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,440
Even the chicken is smarter!

176
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,200
I...

177
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,200
I brought you a bowl

178
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,390
of warm food.

179
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,030
I was too harsh just now.

180
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,360
I got worked up.

181
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,480
Don't take it to heart.

182
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,550
I'm not blaming you.

183
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,111
I know you're just worried about Xiu'er.

184
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,360
You're a good father.

185
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,150
I'm hardly a good father.

186
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,720
I'm busting my back out there

187
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,670
so Xiu'er won't have to

188
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,750
grow up without a father

189
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,630
by her side.

190
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,030
Don't take it wrongly.

191
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,630
Alright, don't let it go cold.

192
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,030
I lost my dad when I was young.

193
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,670
After this time,

194
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
my memory of him

195
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,670
is all but faded.

196
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,240
It's only from watching you with Xiu'er

197
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,440
that I've started to remember again.

198
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,360
My father was strict with me

199
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,510
from a young age.

200
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:47,955
He taught me to ride and shoot.

201
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:49,870
He took me out to sea.

202
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,720
Once, I fell off a horse and got hurt.

203
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,390
He took off a ring

204
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,670
he'd worn for years

205
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,200
to keep himself safe,

206
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,000
and gave it to me.

207
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,000
He said Haihu's
daughter couldn't be soft.

208
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,080
He said that ring

209
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,120
would keep me safe too.

210
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,120
I didn't cry at the time.

211
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,320
I just resented him.

212
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,480
I couldn't understand

213
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,320
why my father

214
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,670
couldn't be like other fathers

215
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,377
and worried about his child's safety.

216
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,080
All I wanted was for him to comfort me.

217
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,720
It wasn't until later I found out

218
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,600
he killed that horse the same day.

219
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,910
But it was that day

220
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,511
I got mad and refused to board the ship.

221
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,630
He went on to Lingnan.

222
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,120
He went to Lingnan...

223
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,790
He died in a fire there.

224
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,644
You know, daughters are

225
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,720
a father's weakness.

226
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,240
It's not that he didn't care about you.

227
00:14:16,777 --> 00:14:18,960
He knew how unpredictable
the sea could be.

228
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,120
He didn't know

229
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,480
if he'd ever make it back.

230
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,910
So he

231
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,630
wanted you to know

232
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,910
that even if you lost your father,

233
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,720
you'd still be able

234
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,870
to stand on your own.

235
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,150
But all these years,

236
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,240
I've been living

237
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,750
with He Youguang.

238
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,510
He's not like my father.

239
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,720
He spoils me.

240
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,360
But all these years,

241
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,720
the refined life he gave me

242
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,240
has gradually

243
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,870
changed who I used to be.

244
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,440
It was like a blade

245
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,630
inlaid with jewels and gilded with gold,

246
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,670
yet sheathed away...

247
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,960
Left to quietly rust.

248
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,120
Now I've lost my status.

249
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,150
I have no money.

250
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,240
I came to Chang'an all on my own.

251
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,822
How can I avenge my father?

252
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,390
I can't do anything.

253
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,360
Life is a whetstone.

254
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,000
As for the blade,

255
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,200
you have to sharpen it

256
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,480
before it can shine again.

257
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,720
You are Haihu's daughter, after all.

258
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,270
Alley Master,

259
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:17,630
once I'm done today,

260
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,422
I'll pick her up.

261
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,439
Eat well, alright?

262
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,120
Thanks.

263
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,480
You're here so early.

264
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,390
Has your father taken on a new job?

265
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,111
He's aiming to come in first today.

266
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,244
I'm a supervisor
from the Shanglin Office.

267
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:55,533
Please give us a moment.

268
00:16:55,977 --> 00:16:57,977
(Lingnan Litchi Transport Notice)

269
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,009
(Supervisor)
What a man.

270
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:07,133
(of Imperial Household Department)
What a remarkable man.

271
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:08,022
You flatter me.

272
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,590
You have the skill and imagination.

273
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,160
Come,

274
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,750
I didn't expect anyone in Chang'an

275
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,590
to be as talented as you.

276
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,510
Tell me,

277
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,440
what do you need from me now?

278
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,920
I need an official

279
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,510
government-issued document.

280
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,440
Only then can I coordinate

281
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,400
ships and postal horses along the way.

282
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:28,844
With the government seal,

283
00:17:28,866 --> 00:17:30,270
I can get the offices to cooperate

284
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,200
seamlessly.

285
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,720
Only then can I
deliver the litchis to Chang'an in time

286
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,400
for the Noble Consort's birthday feast.

287
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,830
There's not much time left.

288
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,066
What are we waiting for?

289
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,000
Let's start the process. Come on.

290
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,640
Start with these.

291
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,830
Fill out the registration documents.

292
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:46,790
Thank you, Supervisor.

293
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,720
You've done me a huge favor.

294
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,310
With talent like yours,

295
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,830
and such bold ambition,

296
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,590
of course, I should support you.

297
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,480
Serving fresh litchis
at the Noble Consort's banquet?

298
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,110
Who came up with that idea?

299
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,350
It's brilliant.

300
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,880
It shows the greatness of Tang,

301
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,550
which is strong, wealthy,

302
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,590
and full of talent.

303
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,510
Are those litchis at the banquet

304
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,400
really just fruit?

305
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,550
No.

306
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,720
They represent the glory of Tang!

307
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,270
"The gates of heaven
open to grand halls,

308
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,310
and the world gathers to pay tribute."

309
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,270
That's exactly the scene we'll have.

310
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,440
How the neighboring states
what true power

311
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,590
really looks like.

312
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,070
Let me see it too.

313
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,440
I want to know
what fresh litchis look like.

314
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'll never forget
what you've done for me.

315
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,200
Wait. These are coming from Lingnan?

316
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,240
His Majesty

317
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,666
asked for litchis from Lingnan.

318
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,680
That's a problem.

319
00:19:02,444 --> 00:19:04,000
The Imperial Household Department

320
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,680
only handles foreign tribute.

321
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,480
What we collect

322
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,830
comes from outside Tang.

323
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,510
Lingnan isn't

324
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,110
our department.

325
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,720
Then...

326
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,955
Then who?

327
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,790
Who do I talk to about Lingnan litchis?

328
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,440
For domestic offerings,

329
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,133
go to the Left Storage Office.

330
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,440
Are you following me?

331
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm here on Deputy Director Lu's
orders to protect you.

332
00:20:03,466 --> 00:20:05,022
You're from the Security Bureau.

333
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,270
Then, tell Deputy Director Lu

334
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,888
I want to see him.

335
00:20:18,044 --> 00:20:19,488
I heard you asked for me.

336
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:21,022
Deputy Director Lu.

337
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:23,844
I believe Master Konglang

338
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,590
has already told you about me.

339
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,960
I came in such haste

340
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,720
because I wanted
to speak with you directly.

341
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,960
I came to Chang'an

342
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,955
to support the Left Chancellor.

343
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,790
And also

344
00:20:36,422 --> 00:20:38,422
to deliver this letter of accusation.

345
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,640
All these years,

346
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,880
He Youguang used my merchant ships

347
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,240
to launder dirty money

348
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,680
under legitimate trade.

349
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,200
He used it to bribe
the Right Chancellor.

350
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,000
I also know

351
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,200
all about

352
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,533
his other corrupt dealings.

353
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,066
I've written it all down for you,

354
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,200
and each charge is a serious crime.

355
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,240
If the Left Chancellor
presents this to His Majesty,

356
00:21:10,155 --> 00:21:12,666
he can hold both the Right Chancellor
and He Youguang

357
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:13,644
accountable.

358
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,160
One person's word isn't enough proof.

359
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,422
Deputy Director Lu.

360
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,750
My father was Haihu,

361
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,244
a name everyone in Lingnan knows.

362
00:21:22,755 --> 00:21:25,088
My mother was Chief
of the Hu Merchants' Association.

363
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,590
My words carry weight.

364
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,000
Besides, I was involved

365
00:21:29,511 --> 00:21:30,777
in He Youguang's dealings.

366
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,590
I'm risking my own life

367
00:21:33,622 --> 00:21:34,800
to bring him down.

368
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,270
I believe the people will believe me.

369
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,110
If we were going after anyone else,

370
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,777
this would be enough.

371
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,440
But the one we want to take down

372
00:21:43,088 --> 00:21:44,955
is the Chancellor of the Tang court.

373
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:46,880
The Right Chancellor is

374
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,200
the Noble Consort's brother.

375
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,070
Just your word alone

376
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,200
is far from enough to convict him.

377
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,070
Even if His Majesty believes you,

378
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,160
the court is filled with his loyalists.

379
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,160
If someone with ill intent

380
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,310
twists this situation,

381
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,680
they could say
the Left Chancellor used you

382
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,590
to frame the Right Chancellor.

383
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,111
Then, we'll be the ones in trouble.

384
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,270
Even if His Majesty

385
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,830
starts to doubt the Right Chancellor,

386
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,200
he won't convict him on the spot.

387
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,790
Once His Majesty calms down,

388
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,400
and the Noble Consort

389
00:22:20,444 --> 00:22:21,880
whispers a few good words

390
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,070
in his ear,

391
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,310
this whole thing

392
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,400
will just blow over.

393
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,920
Not even a ripple.

394
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,000
So my presence in Chang'an

395
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,755
hasn't really helped us yet.

396
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,466
To deal
with a fox-like Right Chancellor,

397
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,590
we need everything in place

398
00:22:39,822 --> 00:22:41,177
to strike a lethal blow.

399
00:22:41,488 --> 00:22:42,680
Only then will we leave him

400
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,590
no chance to recover.

401
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,177
I'll take the letter.

402
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,440
But we must wait

403
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,880
for Master Konglang to finish

404
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,822
gathering all the evidence in Lingnan.

405
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,160
Then, you can come forward.

406
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,240
So you're saying...

407
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,711
All I can do now is wait.

408
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,110
Amita.

409
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,720
The Left Chancellor and I have

410
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:09,044
planned this for years.

411
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,111
Most of this game has been
about holding the line.

412
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:13,720
But,

413
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,155
staying dormant
doesn't mean we've lost.

414
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,270
We don't doubt your sincerity,

415
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,000
but we do need your patience.

416
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:32,920
By now,

417
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,977
Li Shande should be in Chang'an.

418
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,790
How's the litchi mission going?

419
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,030
Is Xiu'er doing alright?

420
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,350
We've had plenty to eat,

421
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,666
but we've wasted many days.

422
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,510
And that Master Konglang...

423
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,110
There, pay up.

424
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,400
Two coins.

425
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,440
Go on, move along.

426
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,577
Wait. At least tell me
where I'm supposed to go?

427
00:23:56,577 --> 00:23:58,080
(Left Storage Office)
Where am I going?

428
00:23:58,111 --> 00:23:59,790
Stop making a fuss here. Go, go, go.

429
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,720
Why are you shouting out here?

430
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,466
How many times have I told you?

431
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,270
Always be polite

432
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,350
to the visitors.

433
00:24:06,455 --> 00:24:08,430
(Supervisor of Left Storage Office)
Everyone we work with,

434
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,422
we do it for the court's sake.
It's tough for us all.

435
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,270
Supervisor Xu.

436
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:13,720
Leping.

437
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,444
This man...

438
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,240
Leping!

439
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,200
Liangyuan?

440
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,270
I've long heard

441
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,666
Chang'an now has a Litchi Envoy.

442
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,240
I never thought that unlucky job

443
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,830
would fall to you, Liangyuan.

444
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,070
Forget it.

445
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,680
What now?

446
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,400
Liangyuan.

447
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,777
You really went to the wrong place.

448
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,790
The storage loss you're asking about

449
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,960
is the spoilage during transport.

450
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,830
The Left Storage Office

451
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,030
only handles storage, not transport.

452
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,550
The transport loss you want covering...

453
00:25:05,911 --> 00:25:07,266
That's the Ministry of War's job.

454
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,044
Go see the Carriage Director.

455
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,550
It won't be easy to reach them.

456
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,070
Their Carriage Bureau
handles the transport.

457
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,350
The Left Storage Office
stores the goods.

458
00:25:17,577 --> 00:25:19,222
You must deal with each other a lot.

459
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,310
You...

460
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,720
Could you maybe...

461
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,200
Liangyuan.

462
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,480
Yes, we do work

463
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,070
closely with the Carriage Bureau.

464
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,400
But thing is...

465
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,480
I'm just a lowly supervisor.

466
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,030
To talk to the Carriage Director,

467
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,333
it'd have to be our Chief.

468
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:39,830
Right.

469
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,160
Then...

470
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,177
Could you maybe...

471
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,920
ask your Chief to help me

472
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,270
pass this petition

473
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,066
along to the Ministry of War?

474
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,555
Here's the thing.

475
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,070
Leave the petition

476
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,200
with me.

477
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,590
I'll put up a few good words

478
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,400
for you with him.

479
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,680
I'll ask him to
get your petition delivered

480
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,266
to the Carriage Director.

481
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,200
That's a huge help.

482
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,640
It really is.

483
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,070
It's nothing.

484
00:26:09,755 --> 00:26:11,288
We studied together for three years.

485
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,510
Back then in mathematics class,
you helped me so much.

486
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,790
To me,

487
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,600
you were both a teacher and a friend.

488
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,160
You flatter me.

489
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,240
You know, this job of mine

490
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,510
sounds like a sweet gig,

491
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,880
but it's actually a death trap.

492
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:28,790
You know,

493
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,640
for the last few days...

494
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,350
Forget it.

495
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,400
You really helped me out.

496
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,030
Leping,

497
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,720
you saved my life.

498
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,488
I salute you.

499
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,200
Liangyuan, it's nothing.

500
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,550
I honestly didn't know

501
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,000
he was your old classmate.

502
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,240
If I had known,

503
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,711
I would've treated him better.

504
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,022
That's not necessary.

505
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,977
It was just that back in the day,

506
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,288
we studied mathematics together
for three years.

507
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,733
If we were really that close,

508
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,844
wouldn't he know I work here?

509
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,030
Then, why did you say

510
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,550
you'd pass his letter along?

511
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,070
I was just brushing him off.

512
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,377
That guy's stubborn as a mule.

513
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,200
I had to say that

514
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,000
so he'd leave.

515
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,310
That letter obviously
isn't proper protocol.

516
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,510
If I handed it over,

517
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,030
I'd get reprimanded and fired.

518
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,177
It's not worth it for some outsider.

519
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,920
If he comes back later,

520
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,880
just tell him

521
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,310
the letter's already been submitted.

522
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,030
The Carriage Bureau

523
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,422
isn't our concern.

524
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,800
And that'll be the end of it.

525
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,911
Liangyuan?

526
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,310
Why are you back again?

527
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,590
Just going to the latrine.

528
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,920
You really taught me a lesson.

529
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,000
Let me ask you one thing.

530
00:27:52,266 --> 00:27:55,177
You knew I was racing
against time with my life on the line,

531
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,640
so why'd you swindle me

532
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,590
with all that talk?

533
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,666
Fine, then let me
ask you a question too.

534
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,350
You knew this was a hopeless mission,

535
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,110
yet you still asked me

536
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,111
to help you submit that letter?

537
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,830
You're fighting fate,

538
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,550
and I'm just supposed to risk my job

539
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,288
and reputation for your mission?

540
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,960
Because we were classmates,

541
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,888
I spared your pride.

542
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,680
If it had been someone else,

543
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:26,111
I would've kicked them out.

544
00:28:26,177 --> 00:28:28,511
If you had kicked me out,
I wouldn't have blamed you.

545
00:28:28,511 --> 00:28:29,933
Business is business.

546
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,830
But at least,

547
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,960
tell me the truth.

548
00:28:32,355 --> 00:28:33,200
You knew full well

549
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,310
I was running out of time,

550
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,955
but you still held me up for a day.

551
00:28:36,022 --> 00:28:37,440
You didn't just waste my time.

552
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,640
You wasted my life!

553
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,440
Li Shande!

554
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,510
Even now,

555
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,510
you still don't get it?

556
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,310
For us Supervisors,

557
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,200
it's better to have no merits
than to make a mistake.

558
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,310
Don't you know exactly

559
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,590
what your job is?

560
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,955
So why should I help?

561
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,590
Knowing full well you're doomed,

562
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,955
why would you still come
knocking and ask for my help?

563
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,440
Why should I pass on

564
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:02,822
your cursed letter?

565
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,720
Just because

566
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,030
you taught me some mathematics?

567
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,044
You really know
how to scheme, don't you?

568
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:10,790
Fine.

569
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,440
Since you don't want

570
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,510
me to be polite,

571
00:29:13,977 --> 00:29:15,310
I'll tell you the truth.

572
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,640
That letter of yours

573
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,711
is hopeless. Don't bother sending it
to the Ministry of War.

574
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,790
To be honest,

575
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,000
this petition

576
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,622
won't even make it
past their front gate.

577
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,800
I'm ashamed to call you a friend.

578
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,790
I'll go there myself!

579
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:57,520
(Ministry of War)

580
00:29:57,622 --> 00:29:59,022
(Ministry of War)
Stop right there.

581
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,090
Do you have a bamboo token?

582
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,480
I have official business.

583
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,422
I need to see the Carriage Director.

584
00:30:05,533 --> 00:30:06,790
This is a military office.

585
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,400
Without a bamboo token, no one enters.

586
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:14,880
Step back.

587
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,422
I dropped my letter.

588
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,960
We stopped you

589
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,110
to save your neck.

590
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,160
If you offend the wrong general

591
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
at the Carriage Bureau,

592
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,590
you're as good as doomed.

593
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,240
Go now.

594
00:30:34,577 --> 00:30:35,888
Don't block the gate.

595
00:30:46,088 --> 00:30:48,288
(Back then,
when litchis couldn't be delivered,)

596
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,550
(they all stayed clear.)

597
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,160
(Now there's a way to transport them,)

598
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,440
(the litchis might make it.)

599
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,000
(And they still)

600
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,577
(trying their best to brush me off.)

601
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,640
(Even if this task of yours)

602
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,160
(is to please His Majesty,)

603
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,680
(it has nothing to do)

604
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,355
(with all those petty clerks.)

605
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,070
(If it succeeds,)

606
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,755
(you get the merits.)

607
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,920
(But if it fails,)

608
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,400
(they'll still be)

609
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,422
(held partially responsible.)

610
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,400
Go raise hell with the lords

611
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,270
of Hall of State Affairs.

612
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,400
(For domestic offerings,)

613
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,929
(go to the Left Storage Office.)

614
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,933
We're not in charge
of what happens en route.

615
00:31:28,955 --> 00:31:30,400
Do it by the book.

616
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,070
Go on, go on.

617
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:37,920
This letter

618
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,550
won't even make it
past their front gate!

619
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:51,790
Stop fighting!

620
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,240
What's going on?

621
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,310
Let go!

622
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,400
Let go!

623
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,510
Let go!

624
00:31:58,177 --> 00:31:58,830
What's happening?

625
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,750
Another fight? Seriously?

626
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,310
She mocks my big head!

627
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,240
I let it slide.

628
00:32:03,244 --> 00:32:04,400
But now she says you'll die

629
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,720
on the first day of June

630
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,960
because of your job!

631
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,222
How could I not hit her?

632
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,680
Alright, that's enough!

633
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,440
Enough! Let go!

634
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,350
Let go!

635
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,440
Let go!

636
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,200
It was my dad who told me.

637
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,640
He said it's all over Chang'an.

638
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,310
You're that poor soul

639
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,960
who got stuck with the litchi job.

640
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,830
If the litchis from Lingnan

641
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,590
don't reach Chang'an on time,

642
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,480
you'll be executed.

643
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,400
Everyone's heard about it now.

644
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,240
You tell them right now!

645
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,680
Are you the Litchi Envoy or not?

646
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,720
All of you,
go home and tell your parents

647
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,880
that these litchis

648
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,960
will make it to Chang'an.

649
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,111
What on earth...

650
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:50,640
Xiu'er?

651
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,830
Are you mad at me?

652
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,355
Silly girl.

653
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,920
Are you that mad at me?

654
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,240
Xiu'er.

655
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,310
Being the Litchi Envoy

656
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,030
is a great job.

657
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,830
The other transport envoys are nothing

658
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,680
compared to me.

659
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,680
They spread those rumors

660
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,310
out of jealousy.

661
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,720
My Xiu'er is sharp as a tack.

662
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,288
How could she not see that?

663
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,350
But why would they

664
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,510
be jealous of you?

665
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,400
Tell me.

666
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,270
Out of all the posts in the empire,

667
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:02,311
who's the most important
person to serve?

668
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:03,640
His Majesty.

669
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,350
That's right.

670
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,400
The Imperial Court

671
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,310
would spare no expense

672
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,200
to make sure
His Majesty's task is done?

673
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,760
Now think about transport.

674
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,550
The longer the journey,
the more it costs.

675
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,800
Now tell me,

676
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,550
in all of Tang,

677
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,630
is there any place

678
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,755
farther than Lingnan?

679
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,630
Exactly!

680
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,630
That's why I went to Lingnan

681
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,070
to bring litchis to His Majesty.

682
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,360
That job costs the most

683
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,630
and has the most perks.

684
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,760
That's why they're all jealous of me.

685
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,866
These past few days,

686
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,440
everywhere I've gone to handle business,

687
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,920
the officers all knew me.

688
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,760
Everyone's been talking about me.

689
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,110
But they all say

690
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,630
litchis from Lingnan

691
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,377
can't be shipped to Chang'an.

692
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,710
They say your mission is impossible.

693
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,550
But I am going to be the first

694
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,777
to bring litchis to Chang'an.

695
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,800
Those people failed

696
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,960
because they weren't good.

697
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,400
But I am different.

698
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,360
Because I can

699
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,190
calculate.

700
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,511
Give me a smile.

701
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,110
Father, are you being honest?

702
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:12,710
Totally.

703
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,070
Father.

704
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,550
I have one more question.

705
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,630
Will Amita

706
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,955
stay in Chang'an for good?

707
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,320
I don't know.

708
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,711
I haven't asked her yet.

709
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,630
Will she keep living

710
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,110
in that place we're renting?

711
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,480
If the rent is due,

712
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,444
she must pay for it.

713
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:34,920
So,

714
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,866
she's not moving in with us?

715
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,840
Why would she?

716
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,920
The house won't fit.

717
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:49,920
Xiu'er.

718
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:56,488
Amita and I are just friends.

719
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,440
Just friends.

720
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,800
For all my life,

721
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,630
there's only been

722
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,955
your mother in my heart.

723
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,480
Only your mother

724
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,280
truly understood me.

725
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:18,630
Back then,

726
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,920
I graduated
from the Mathematics Division.

727
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,840
But somehow,

728
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,840
I ended up being assigned
to the Shanglin Office

729
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,880
to deal with flowers and plants.

730
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,760
I was clueless.

731
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:34,920
Later on, I met your mother.

732
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,320
We got married.

733
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,190
We moved here.

734
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,630
Your mother personally

735
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,110
planted that osmanthus tree.

736
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,480
One winter, it snowed heavily.

737
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,110
I said

738
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,190
that osmanthus tree

739
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,111
wouldn't make it.

740
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,070
But your mother insisted
on taking care of it.

741
00:36:50,133 --> 00:36:51,555
She tended it, and fertilized it.

742
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,880
Your mother said

743
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,960
she was sure she could save it.

744
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,977
And sure enough, the next year,

745
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,110
the osmanthus sprouted again.

746
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,630
Your mother used to say

747
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,590
that flowers and plants
all have a spirit.

748
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,280
If you're good to them,

749
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,066
they'll repay your kindness.

750
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,630
(Osmanthus represents success,)

751
00:37:17,155 --> 00:37:18,800
(it means having nobles on your side.)

752
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,400
Later, at the Shanglin Office,

753
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,880
I worked with

754
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,177
flowers and plants every day.

755
00:37:34,222 --> 00:37:36,288
I always remembered
what your mother said.

756
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,510
Eventually, I became an expert.

757
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,320
So you see,

758
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,440
in this life,

759
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,710
I have only ever

760
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,880
had your mother in his heart.

761
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,440
Qilang,

762
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,480
Master Konglang tells us not to

763
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,920
go to Konglang Bookstore

764
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,177
unless it's urgent.

765
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,400
Well, we just happened to pass by.

766
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,400
Asking for a quick update

767
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,440
is totally normal.

768
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,320
Qilang,

769
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,960
this is not just passing by.

770
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,320
You were sprinting

771
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,360
straight to her place.

772
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,710
Besides,

773
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,840
if you're here to ask
about the progress,

774
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:20,960
why did you buy

775
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,577
a fan made for women?

776
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,280
We can't show up empty-handed.

777
00:38:24,422 --> 00:38:26,155
It's called courtesy. Get it?

778
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,150
I think it's because you haven't

779
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,022
seen Master Konglang in days.

780
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,590
You've been lovesick.

781
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:36,710
Gou'er.

782
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,466
Ever since you were little,

783
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,550
has anyone ever

784
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,777
shut your mouth?

785
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,000
You worry about serious matters.

786
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,800
You have no time

787
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,200
for silly romantic nonsense.

788
00:38:53,177 --> 00:38:54,022
Well hit.

789
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:57,920
Gou'er.

790
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,600
How do I look today?

791
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,800
Do I look sharp? Presentable?

792
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,440
You surely look

793
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,355
like a refined gentleman
in a messy world.

794
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,000
Come here.

795
00:39:11,888 --> 00:39:14,511
Try talking like Zhao Xinmin again,
and I'll end you.

796
00:39:17,902 --> 00:39:23,330
(Study Hall)

797
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,911
Go back and wait for news.

798
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,333
I know Master Konglang has her rules.

799
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,155
Things must go in order.

800
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,670
This matter I'm asking about

801
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,955
is extremely urgent.

802
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,360
This silver ingot

803
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,480
is my hope that she can
handle my request first.

804
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,866
If it's the rule,
then it can't be broken.

805
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,000
I'll pass your message along.

806
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,190
Please leave now.

807
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,955
Guiyun?

808
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,555
Xinmin?

809
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:34,230
What brings you here?

810
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,133
What else but to buy books?

811
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,088
Weren't you here for books too?

812
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,440
Yes, I was.

813
00:40:44,466 --> 00:40:45,755
Didn't find anything I liked,

814
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,960
so I'll try somewhere else.

815
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,000
We'll talk another day then.

816
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:52,600
Farewell.

817
00:40:52,644 --> 00:40:53,070
Farewell.

818
00:40:59,982 --> 00:41:01,770
(Study Hall)

819
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,070
Where is he?

820
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,311
Xinmin, you're back?

821
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,977
I didn't check
the shelves in the back just now.

822
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:33,244
I came to have another look.

823
00:41:34,111 --> 00:41:35,622
And to keep you company, Guiyun.

824
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,670
What book are you looking for?

825
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I'm looking for

826
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:44,533
"Longevity Sutra of Grand Vows".

827
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,880
I want to recite it every day

828
00:41:47,244 --> 00:41:48,760
to pray for the Right Chancellor.

829
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,670
You truly are

830
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,880
devoted to the Right Chancellor.

831
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,111
That fan you're holding

832
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:04,440
is a round fan of pink silk embroidery.

833
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,777
Clearly something a woman would use.

834
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,190
Could it be that someone

835
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,711
has caught your eye at the bookstore?

836
00:42:15,688 --> 00:42:17,400
You've got it wrong, Xinmin.

837
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,190
The fan is for my own use.

838
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,480
Don't joke like that.

839
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,070
Look.

840
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,866
There's more to this fan
than meets the eye.

841
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,955
It glows white.

842
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:37,890
=The Litchi Road=

843
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,440
If the Litchi Envoy

844
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,230
really figures out

845
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,230
how to transport fresh litchis,

846
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:46,840
then he holds

847
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,190
a golden ticket

848
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:51,911
to unimaginable riches.

849
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,400
I heard Li Shande has returned.

850
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:57,960
Are you sure?

851
00:42:59,110 --> 00:42:59,630
Why not

852
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,777
invite him over

853
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,711
for a little catching up
at the Shanglin Office?

854
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,550
