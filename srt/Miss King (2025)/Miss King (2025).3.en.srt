1
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,234
Are you an idiot?

2
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:27,861
Badge of honor--

3
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,904
I'm so sorry you had to bring him here!

4
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:31,364
No worries.

5
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,699
Thank you.

6
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:35,827
Well, then…

7
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:41,291
You're not qualified
to play against Shoichi Yuuki.

8
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,377
Qualified?

9
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,130
Sit.

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,136
Go ahead.

11
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,596
Excuse me.

12
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,766
Reiko, bring us drinks.

13
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,646
Ouch! What was that for?!

14
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,566
Stop bossing me around, freeloader.

15
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,200
To play against Shoichi Yuuki,
one must be a <i>kishi</i>.

16
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,576
Then, I'll become a <i>kishi</i>.

17
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,244
It's not that easy.

18
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,454
What?

19
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:23,500
To be a <i>kishi</i>,
you need to train at the Shoreikai.

20
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,586
You must perform
to certain standards and climb the ranks.

21
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,087
SHOREIKAI: <i>KISHI</i> TRAINING INSTITUTION

22
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:33,134
Additionally, only four make it
up the ranks to become a <i>kishi</i> each year.

23
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,719
Besides that…

24
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:38,264
You have to be the
very first female <i>kishi</i> ever.

25
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:45,396
But isn't there a female <i>kishi</i>
who's active right now?

26
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,359
Here.

27
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,945
Like her.

28
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,906
Oh, that's Yuna Hayami.

29
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,034
She's not a <i>kishi</i>. She's a <i>joryu kishi</i>.

30
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,828
Aren't they the same?

31
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,914
<i>Joryu kishi</i>, a female pro,
and <i>kishi</i>, a male pro, are different.

32
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,625
There has never been a female <i>kishi</i>.

33
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,377
Whoa, isn't that discrimination?

34
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,797
No, there are women in the Shoreikai.

35
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,716
But so far, no woman could become a <i>kishi</i>.

36
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,095
In the 100 years since
the shogi association began,

37
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,180
there's been no female <i>kishi</i>.

38
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,809
Plus, they also have an age limit.

39
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,436
What's the cutoff?

40
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,022
Twenty-six.

41
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,443
At twenty-six,
you're kicked out of the Shoreikai.

42
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:36,156
Which means, you're already…

43
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,201
out of time.

44
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,123
Does that mean…

45
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,508
No, there's another way.

46
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:59,345
As an amateur, you can become
a <i>kishi</i> through the<i> kishi</i> admission test.

47
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,139
<i>KISHI</i> ADMISSION TEST

48
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:05,226
If you rank high in amateur tournaments,
you qualify for pro matches.

49
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:11,274
If you win over ten official pro matches
with a rate of 65 percent or higher,

50
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,526
you can take the <i>kishi </i>admission test.

51
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:16,779
In the test,
you'll play five games with <i>kishi</i>.

52
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,617
If you win over three, you become a <i>kishi</i>.

53
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,328
So, I just need to keep winning?

54
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,706
That's right. Just don't lose.

55
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,083
Reiko, hand me that flyer.

56
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,668
Oh, this?

57
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,548
AMATEUR GYOKUSHO MATCH

58
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,720
But you can't go in unprepared.

59
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,431
Play a match with me.

60
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,103
- Whoa!
- No, thanks.

61
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:53,191
Hey, wait! Are you even listening to me?

62
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,449
YUUKI

63
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,785
She told me to quit shogi.

64
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,205
- Your mother.
- Oh.

65
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,668
She'd let me marry you on that condition.

66
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,677
Listen to me.

67
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,182
What's the big deal?

68
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,434
Just quit.

69
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:30,812
What?

70
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,359
I mean, think about it.

71
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:41,030
It's not easy to keep playing shogi
in a world full of men.

72
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:48,746
Besides, "First-Ever Female <i>Kishi</i>"
is just a nice trophy title right?

73
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,251
But that title will stay in history!

74
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,212
Forever.

75
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,021
Hey, your parents
might be home any minute…

76
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,274
I…

77
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,943
Yuna, I…

78
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:24,615
I don't want you to live a hellish life.

79
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:47,346
AMATEUR GYOKUSHO MATCH TOKYO PRELIMINARY

80
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,520
A woman?

81
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,731
That's rare.

82
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,218
I lost?

83
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,856
Miss, you're not bad for a beginner.

84
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,900
For example, this move--

85
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,707
Oh! Hi, Asuka.

86
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,045
Tell me.

87
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,840
What?

88
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,135
Why did I lose?

89
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,473
Why you lost?

90
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,308
You don't get it, do you?

91
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,394
You thought you were good?

92
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,480
Don't underestimate shogi.

93
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,981
How long since you last played?

94
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,236
Twenty years at least.

95
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,700
And you thought
you'd just walk in and win?

96
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,243
But on that day…

97
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:27,924
ROOK

98
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,467
<i>That was just a fluke.</i>

99
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,678
Don't underestimate shogi or <i>kishi.</i>

100
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:36,307
Shogi is a way of life for <i>kishi.</i>

101
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,059
It goes beyond the board.

102
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,813
Sit down.

103
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:01,749
Do you think you can beat me?

104
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,803
I'm not trying to win now.

105
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,346
What?

106
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,576
I lost again!

107
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:41,247
You're weak. You lack everything.

108
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,374
You could never kill Shoichi Yuuki.

109
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:51,424
Ever wondered why
Shoichi left you and your mother?

110
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,596
Maybe because you were so worthless!

111
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,055
What?!

112
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,181
Hey, Seigo.

113
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:03,102
What a fraud you are.

114
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,745
Disappeared?

115
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,079
<i>Yeah. Gone.</i>

116
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,832
Asuka Kunimi is gone.

117
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,722
Make yourself at home.

118
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,724
Are you sure?

119
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,018
You have nowhere to go, right?

120
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,021
Well…

121
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,274
One more freeloader won't change a thing.

122
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,954
Thank you so much.

123
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,260
<i>Ever wondered why</i>
<i>Shoichi left you and your mother?</i>

124
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,223
<i>Maybe because you were so worthless!</i>

125
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,393
Don't touch my shogi set!

126
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,687
<i>Leave me alone, will you?</i>

127
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,147
I must win.

128
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,943
<i>You should stop playing shogi.</i>

129
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,904
<i>It'll be okay now.</i>

130
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,156
Asuka,

131
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,244
don't be like me.

132
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,789
Be free and live your life.

133
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,861
What's up?

134
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,988
I couldn't sleep.

135
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:22,908
I see.

136
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,501
Did you come over to help?

137
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:34,670
Yeah.

138
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,882
Okay, then.
Could you clean the tables with this?

139
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:38,841
Sure.

140
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,494
You've frozen.

141
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,622
Sorry.

142
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:18,172
Seigo told me about your situation.

143
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,095
I'm so sorry about your mother.

144
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,057
It must've been hard.

145
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,352
No…

146
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,481
Seigo was awful, wasn't he?

147
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,652
You're still processing
the loss of your mother.

148
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,946
Revenge and killing?

149
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:47,076
And calling you weak?
You can only handle so much at once.

150
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,079
He really lacks emotional intelligence.

151
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,335
But I think…

152
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,422
he's serious in his own way.

153
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,636
It's been so long since
he last brought out the shogi set.

154
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,640
He's been through a lot
and couldn't play for a while.

155
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,740
Breakfast! Hey, wake up!

156
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:30,077
Ouch, it hurts! Don't be so rough!

157
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,662
I said breakfast!

158
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,373
I don't want it. I'm hungover--

159
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,006
I'm a freeloader too.

160
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,774
You still get hungry
after a bad loss, huh?

161
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,276
Ouch!

162
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,319
Stop talking.

163
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,904
I'm sorry.

164
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,073
This miso soup is so delicious.

165
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,909
Asuka made it.

166
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:10,951
What?

167
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,581
My mother taught me
when she was still alive.

168
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,418
Oh, okay. I see.

169
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,005
Yeah. It's good.

170
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:33,974
What?

171
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,317
Mr. Todou, about what you said last night…

172
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,236
I have absolutely no idea.

173
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,574
The reason that man left me and my mother.

174
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,828
I thought about it, over and over.

175
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,539
But it pissed me off.

176
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,919
It pissed me off, so I wanted to kill him.

177
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,672
I see. Good for you.

178
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,341
- What?
- What's good about it?

179
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,387
To play shogi, you need an opponent.

180
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,223
You play against a human being.
Remember that.

181
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,477
You face them even when you don't want to.

182
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,899
And don't ever run
from your own weakness either.

183
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,489
All right. Let's go.

184
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,576
In return for your miso soup.

185
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:39,832
Thank your mother
for teaching you this recipe.

186
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,876
Come on.

187
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,211
What?

188
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,217
Sorry. Thank you for the food.

189
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,231
Hello, there!

190
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,149
Hi!

191
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,191
Oh, you're here.

192
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,693
- Hello.
- Hi!

193
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:11,655
Hi, Mr. Todou! Good time yesterday.

194
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,242
Hi, Mr. Sankichi.
She's the one I told you about yesterday.

195
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,995
The lion cub.

196
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,957
Oh, really. She's the one. I see.

197
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:31,425
BEGINNER FRIENDLY
ICHIGEKI SHOGI CLUB

198
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:04,041
This bishop is mine!

199
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,714
I win, don't I?

200
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,010
You lost.

201
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:23,519
Miss, you handle your pieces
pretty rough, don't you?

202
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,984
At the end of a shogi game,
you have a post-game analysis,

203
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:34,071
where you review
and evaluate each other's moves.

204
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,447
Don't run away.

205
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:42,996
Come to this pit everyday
and play shogi to death.

206
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,167
Well, Mr. Sankichi. Take care of her.

207
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,627
I sure will.

208
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,221
Yesterday, the association reached out.

209
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,391
They want you to be the next chairman.

210
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,436
Of course,
I'll handle the practical matters.

211
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,983
All you need to do is sit in the chair.

212
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:17,823
I know you've always dreamed of us
standing at the top of the shogi world.

213
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,117
That's right.

214
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:28,500
But as things stand now, that may
quickly end with Shoichi's generation.

215
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,097
Here's your drink. Enjoy.

216
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,226
Asuka, you're home!

217
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,895
I'm home.

218
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,230
So, how many wins?

219
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,065
Two.

220
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,235
Wow, Asuka! That's amazing.

221
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,571
And how many losses?

222
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,242
Thirty-nine.

223
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,119
What?

224
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,750
We have the Amateur Meioh Match next week.

225
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,628
If you lose here, give up on your revenge.

226
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,047
Next week? That's impossible.

227
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,049
Shut up, Reiko!

228
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,969
We're going for the impossible here.

229
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,915
I resign.

230
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,555
It was this move here…

231
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,189
I resign.

232
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,960
Ah.

233
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,295
Nice.

234
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,046
I resign.

235
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,215
- That was close.
- Very close.

236
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,051
I really thought
you might win until the mid-game.

237
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,011
Right?

238
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:48,390
You need to know
when to attack and when to hold back.

239
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,600
Your judgment was a bit off, you know?

240
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,228
- That's true.
- Patience is crucial.

241
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,355
- That's right.
- She did well.

242
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,898
You've gotten much better.

243
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,483
- Yeah.
- I agree.

244
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,952
AMATEUR MEIOH MATCH

245
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,334
Sorry!

246
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,585
Took you long enough!

247
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,045
I said sorry!

248
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,718
What's with that outfit?

249
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,472
Ms. Reiko suggested I change.

250
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,473
What can I say?

251
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:33,268
I felt bad watching her hunched over
the board like a rag every day.

252
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,980
Can't she look decent
for a match at least?

253
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,774
Stop pitying her.

254
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,027
<i>Attention everyone,</i>
<i>the opening ceremony is about to begin.</i>

255
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:44,780
Okay!

256
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:54,247
As we open the tournament today,
I'd like to welcome a wonderful guest.

257
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,583
Yuna Hayami, <i>joryu</i> 3-dan!

258
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,127
Yuna!

259
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,422
THE 32ND AMATEUR MEIOH MATCH TOKYO

260
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,383
Hello, everyone. I'm Yuna Hayami.

261
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,471
- Wow.
- Yuna!

262
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,891
You're still popular as ever!

263
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,392
What is she, an idol?

264
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:18,396
Well, Hayami <i>joryu</i> 3-dan, may we ask you
to officially open the tournament.

265
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:24,319
Certainly! I hereby declare
the opening of Amateur Meioh Match!

266
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,923
Oh, it's you again.

267
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,140
Too bad for you. I'll beat you again.

268
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:03,942
FIRST ROUND

269
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,719
No way…

270
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,557
I resign.

271
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,277
You jumped your knight here.

272
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,364
But you could've defended
the third file with the rook.

273
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:35,867
Hey, how did she get so good
all of a sudden?

274
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:45,126
Staying out late?
You have a big tournament tomorrow.

275
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,504
When I said today might be my last day,

276
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:50,757
the grandpas decided
to throw a farewell party.

277
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,136
They asked me to visit and shook my hands.

278
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,473
I see. That's nice.

279
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,270
So, did you figure out your weakness?

280
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,480
Yes.

281
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:08,692
You tend to rush to win.

282
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:12,904
On the contrary,
many strategies aim for not losing.

283
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,282
That's what opening theory is for.

284
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,410
A player like you,
who goes straight for the king,

285
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,287
can be vulnerable against that.

286
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,164
Like I said,
shogi is a way of life. I'm saying--

287
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,250
Is this going to take a while?

288
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,376
What?

289
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,503
I want you to apologize first.

290
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,715
Even though my mother and I
did nothing wrong,

291
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:35,969
you forced me to understand
why that man left us.

292
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,304
That was awful.

293
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,685
Well, how many games today?

294
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,521
Forty-two.

295
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,024
How was it?

296
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,694
I don't think I have…

297
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,240
anything left to learn there.

298
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,497
<i>I see.</i>

299
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,250
You can only go so far
with talent alone, huh?

300
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,752
So,

301
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:09,919
did you apologize?

302
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,631
That helped her! It's harsh medicine.

303
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,134
You're awful.

304
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:22,974
SECOND ROUND

305
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,613
I resign.

306
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,368
AMATEUR MEIOH MATCH A-CLASS

307
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:45,163
THIRD ROUND

308
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,848
SEMIFINAL

309
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,406
I resign.

310
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,251
<i>Still haven't found her?</i>

311
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,045
The landlord and realtor
don't know her new address.

312
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,588
<i>Hurry and find her.</i>

313
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,222
Thank you for the match.

314
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,807
Thank you.

315
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:57,944
What a surprise.

316
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,322
I didn't expect to find
such a talented woman here.

317
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,454
But promoting the bishop here,

318
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,999
if he'd moved silver to the third,
you would've been in trouble.

319
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:17,255
It might've been better
to go with the gold.

320
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,554
But in that case…

321
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,391
Gold…

322
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,607
Silver. I'm blocked. Couldn't checkmate.

323
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,406
Ms. Kunimi.

324
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,328
Will you have a match with me sometime?

325
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,288
What?

326
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,084
Sure.

327
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,837
Sorry, Yuna.

328
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,716
Tatsuya, I found someone interesting.

329
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,305
What? Do you know her?

330
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,355
I assumed you hated shogi.

331
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,151
You're even dressed for the occasion?

332
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,404
What's gotten into you?

333
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:25,990
None of your business.

334
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,158
It totally is.

335
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,870
Have you forgotten about the oath?

336
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,836
You must refrain from any action
that would cause possible harm to us.

337
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,295
So shogi is unacceptable--

338
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:42,966
What?

339
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,760
What?!

340
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:54,644
Tastes like crap. What a waste of time.

341
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,981
Were you still
hanging onto shogi, Master Todou?

342
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:02,318
Spoiled boy stuck in C-Class
talking big, huh?

343
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,945
That's not your business.

344
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,448
It totally is. Want to mess with her?
You go through me first.

345
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,242
She is my…

346
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,081
What are you?

347
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,208
Whatever.

348
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,961
Just go away, C-Class boy!

349
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:25,341
Go. Go away. Now. Beat it!

350
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,343
Hey!

351
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,555
Good luck with the finals.

352
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:41,441
FINAL

353
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:06,716
Let's have a good game.

354
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,509
Likewise.

355
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,879
Hey, is she smiling?

356
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,591
I've never seen her look like that.

357
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,637
So, how is she doing?

358
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:57,475
It's very close.
This is the crucial point.

359
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,580
ROOK

360
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:26,671
<i>Stop…</i>

361
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,847
<i>Stop playing shogi…</i>

362
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,397
<i>Stop it.</i>

363
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,361
What's wrong?

364
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,451
<i>Stop playing…</i>

365
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:03,875
<i>Stop playing shogi…</i>

366
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,613
When I play shogi,
everyone ends up miserable.

367
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:36,616
Cut that crap.
Try making me any more miserable.

368
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,409
<i>He punched Shoichi Yuuki.</i>

369
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,787
<i>I'm quitting shogi.</i>

370
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,371
<i>You talked Asuka into it.</i>

371
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,708
Weren't you going to team up
and kill Shoichi Yuuki with shogi?

372
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,086
<i>Why did you attack Shoichi Yuuki?</i>

373
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,297
My dad died.
