1
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:22,731
SHOGI ASSOCIATION HEADQUARTERS

2
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,320
Are you authorized?

3
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,780
I'm a <i>kishi</i>.

4
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,198
- Sorry.
- Apologies.

5
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,039
Well, a former <i>kishi</i>.

6
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,841
Long time no see, everyone.

7
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,134
Seigo Todou here.

8
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:58,016
I'm here today
to speak with Shoichi Yuuki.

9
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:01,478
The new chairman of
the Japan Shogi Association.

10
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,980
Is he here?

11
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,448
I assume you've all heard of Asuka Kunimi.

12
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,867
She's been winning matches against <i>kishi</i>,

13
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,287
and defeated Hayami <i>joryu </i>3-dan,
in the last tournament.

14
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,083
She only needs another win
to qualify for the <i>kishi</i> admission test.

15
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,502
- Call security.
- Okay.

16
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,048
I'm not here to punch Yuuki again.

17
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,550
Mr. Todou, this is not appropriate.

18
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:37,722
I just came to ask why Asuka Kunimi
isn't allowed into tournaments.

19
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:42,894
So you know, huh?

20
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,021
Then tell me.

21
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,610
Hey! Anyone care to explain?

22
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,612
That's him.

23
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:54,948
Come with us.

24
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,741
Hands off! I won't do anything.

25
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:57,659
Calm down!

26
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,911
Get off me! I'm calm!

27
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,709
Being violent again?

28
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,962
Let Asuka Kunimi compete!

29
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,255
Please leave.

30
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,591
Are you all her puppets, or what?

31
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:17,178
Why're you interfering when
the very first female <i>kishi</i> is emerging?

32
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,098
Don't you have any pride
as a shogi player?

33
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,940
I'm just playing the best move.

34
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:32,652
And I'm no longer a shogi player.

35
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,404
Take him out.

36
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,321
Yes, ma'am.

37
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,948
- Come on.
- This way.

38
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,033
Don't think you can get away.

39
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,911
Asuka Kunimi hasn't resigned yet.

40
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,746
You haven't defeated her yet!

41
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,373
Get your hands off me!

42
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,769
Are you okay like that?

43
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,440
Sure. I could put them closer
so they'd topple cleaner--

44
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,275
I'm not talking about the dominoes.

45
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,484
What?

46
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,071
You've been banned from tournaments,
right?

47
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,197
Aren't you anxious?

48
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,367
Well yeah, but…

49
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,580
It's not like I can do anything
to change the situation.

50
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:29,459
Yes, that's true.

51
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:33,296
Mr. Todou's helping me get permission
to enter the tournaments, so…

52
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,965
Right.

53
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,682
KING

54
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,981
I will beat him.

55
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,281
Hey, let's go.

56
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,491
Aw, man.

57
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,534
To where? What about the association?

58
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,954
They're a bunch of idiots.
Totally useless.

59
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,250
But that helped me figure it out.

60
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,712
Use your rook in a cross.

61
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,548
If the vertical is blocked, go horizontal.

62
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,425
Let's go play some shogi.

63
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,807
Hey, where are you going?

64
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,642
To play the next move.

65
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,447
That went quite smoothly.

66
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,533
Yes, very good.

67
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,037
Thank you for your hard work.

68
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,706
Thank you.

69
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,291
- Shall we have lunch?
- Thank you.

70
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,208
Yes, let's go.

71
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:53,876
Thank you, sir.

72
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,920
Oh, hi. Got a game today?

73
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,173
Yes. I'm on lunch break.

74
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,804
Well, good luck.

75
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,894
Perfect timing.

76
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:17,442
You will be the director
of the tournament operations.

77
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,568
APPOINTMENT

78
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,861
What?

79
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:23,823
I'd like you to support the association
as a director from now on.

80
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,370
Are you serious, Mom?

81
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,458
Here, you will call me
"Executive Director".

82
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,878
Well…

83
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,590
I'm counting on you, Director Yuuki.

84
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:09,160
TESSAI ANDO

85
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,919
It's been so long, Master Tessai.

86
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,801
I apologize for all the trouble back then.

87
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,887
What are you doing here? You left shogi.

88
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,974
This is Asuka Kunimi.

89
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,936
Shoichi Yuuki's daughter.

90
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,774
She's trying to become a <i>kishi</i>.

91
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:46,280
But the association is interfering,
banning her from tournaments.

92
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,200
Master Tessai, could you please help--

93
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,409
Not my business.

94
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,203
Leave.

95
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,914
We've been long over.

96
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,584
Besides, I'm not the chairman now.

97
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,044
Master Tessai!

98
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,255
She's strong.

99
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,090
Not like other ordinary <i>kishi</i>.

100
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:07,135
She might even beat you.

101
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,891
What are you saying?

102
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:18,146
Wouldn’t you like to see
the very first female <i>kishi</i>?

103
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,482
Asuka Kunimi has the potential.

104
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:26,487
The disciple you once failed
to make a <i>kishi</i> is interfering.

105
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,156
Kaori Yuuki.

106
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,298
Oh, right. I remember now…

107
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:50,511
You were good at mind games.

108
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,021
Play a game with me.

109
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,068
Beautiful sound.

110
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:53,741
Kaori Yuuki also used to
make that sound when she played.

111
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,590
That's a beautiful sound you made.

112
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,092
Staying back to practice, Kaori?

113
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,093
Yes.

114
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,305
Just don't push yourself too hard.

115
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,348
Master.

116
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,349
Yes?

117
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,896
Is it true that
women can't become a <i>kishi</i>?

118
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,106
What?

119
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,776
Well no, that's not--

120
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:32,530
Is it true that women are weaker than men?

121
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,825
I…

122
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,329
I must become stronger, like my father.

123
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,959
I'll become strong
and leave the Shoreikai.

124
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,299
And I'll become a <i>kishi</i>.

125
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,477
But…

126
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:09,150
If you focus only
on which moves to make in the future,

127
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:14,196
you might have the rug
pulled out from under you.

128
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,615
Have some.

129
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,113
I resign.

130
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,053
I resign.

131
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,262
Thank you.

132
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,333
I resign.

133
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,264
Great, you're crying now.

134
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,391
That's why women are…

135
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,910
Hi, Kaori. Tough day today, huh?

136
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:30,166
But with your excellence,
you would dominate as a <i>joryu kishi</i>.

137
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,419
That'll be the best.

138
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,337
Spice up the shogi world.

139
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,882
Become a <i>joryu</i>.

140
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,133
See you.

141
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,692
- Hey, look.
- Oh, what?

142
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,320
Whoa, hey.

143
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,696
- No way.
- Seriously?

144
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,281
Come on…

145
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,451
You're kidding me.

146
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,716
I resign.

147
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:24,321
<i>That's how much pressure</i>
<i>Kaori Yuuki put on herself.</i>

148
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,659
Yet, she still couldn't make it.

149
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,965
ROOK

150
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,116
You can tell how confident the move is

151
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,159
from the sound.

152
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,044
Want some?

153
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,847
No thanks.

154
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,519
- Hey!
- I don't mind at all.

155
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,355
Sorry about her.

156
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,154
So…

157
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:56,205
Why do you want to become
the first female <i>kishi</i>?

158
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,670
No woman has ever made it until now.

159
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,047
It's a thorny path.

160
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,131
And yet, you--

161
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,718
Are you already retired?

162
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,178
- What?
- Hey!

163
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,016
That's right. I retired when I was 62.

164
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,268
Sixty-two years old.

165
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:20,896
But…

166
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,442
you retired
because you couldn't win anymore.

167
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,569
Hey, idiot!

168
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,952
I'm so sorry.

169
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,295
Oh, I mean,

170
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,339
it's just the same, isn't it?

171
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,841
Your question earlier.

172
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:49,967
What?

173
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,096
Age? Gender?

174
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,891
None of that matters
when you sit at the board, does it?

175
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,241
Yes.

176
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,453
It doesn't matter.

177
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,552
I didn't ask the question
in the right way.

178
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:39,767
Why do you want to become a <i>kishi</i>?

179
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,734
To fight against this shitty world.

180
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,258
Great sound.

181
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,847
I resign.

182
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,729
Don't ever change.

183
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,690
Stay true to yourself.

00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,059
Again…

186
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,062
I lost.

187
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,532
Mom told me…

188
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,453
to be the association's director.

189
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,668
Apparently…

190
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,381
the Yuuki family
doesn't need a <i>joryu kishi</i>

191
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,177
or a C-Class player.

192
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:45,744
PRIVATE MATCH ROOM

193
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:54,253
SINGLE-MINDED DEDICATION

194
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:09,184
NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

195
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:31,581
I didn't realize.
Please excuse me for interrupting you.

196
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,793
Your father…

197
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,756
took very good care of me.

198
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:46,930
I'm so honored you remember him.

199
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,100
Good luck.

200
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,276
I'm…

201
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,239
I'm quitting shogi.

202
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,038
I followed his words here.

203
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,708
I tried to be strong.

204
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,211
I solely focused on shogi…

205
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,215
leaving everything else behind.

206
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,346
What else now?

207
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,601
I have…

208
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,521
nothing else to leave behind.

209
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,908
What could I have done…

210
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:54,414
to be strong like you?

211
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,882
I'm sorry.

212
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,636
I'm just weak. That's all.

213
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,185
I don't know…

214
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,689
if you're really weak.

215
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,785
But,

216
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,083
I know that…

217
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,130
I am weak too.

218
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:53,890
I've been drawing strength
from Master Yuuki's words.

219
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,811
That's why I'm in this room,

220
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:02,315
facing the board for hours.

221
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,864
In the eyes of people,

222
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,491
I was a villain.

223
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,494
A monster.

224
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,789
Heartless.

225
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,880
After I found myself at my lowest point…

226
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:34,931
I am finally…

227
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,311
getting close.

228
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:45,108
I'm finally about
to grasp my own style in shogi.

229
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,157
It is in my reach now.

230
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,164
I don't want to lose it again.

231
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:13,803
I still have…

232
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,682
a long way to go.

233
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,671
You're allowed into tournaments now!

234
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,382
I knew Master Tessai could make it happen.

235
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,133
That's amazing!

236
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,052
List of participants.

237
00:25:57,013 --> 00:26:00,267
- Seigo. Great job!
- Right.

238
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,269
My plan worked.

239
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:17,450
TOFU NEWSPAPER CUP FUSO TOURNAMENT

240
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,665
WAITING ROOM

241
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,044
Why are you in the tournament?

242
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:38,430
I'm not your puppet.

243
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,350
I live my life on my own terms.

244
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:48,064
If you lose…

245
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,111
you know what happens.

246
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,449
I know.

247
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,368
Executive Yuuki.

248
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,975
- Chairman. Pleasure to see you.
- Hi there.

249
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,561
Master Tessai told me about her.

250
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,105
Asuka Kunimi, amateur.

251
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,484
Sounds like she's in the spotlight.

252
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,029
Yes, she is.

253
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:55,048
If she wins, she can take
the <i>kishi</i> admission test?

254
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,091
Yes.

255
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,933
It is time for the first round.

256
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,560
Asuka Kunimi, amateur versus
Tatsuya Yuuki, 6-dan.

257
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,145
Please begin.

258
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,107
Let's have a good game.

259
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:13,983
Yes.

260
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,636
Doesn't look like
he's going to make it easy.

261
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,471
Really?

262
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,875
Damn.

263
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:15,587
Hey, why is he so strong?

264
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:20,425
The opponents she's had so far
knew nothing about her.

265
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:24,763
You can take measures if you know
the opponent's habits and favorite moves.

266
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:29,476
That boy must've studied
Asuka's style closely.

267
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,062
That's no good!

268
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,860
Kunimi amateur, ten minutes remaining.

269
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,906
That's a nasty setup.

270
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:47,786
He's staying out of her territory,
while slowly dismantling her plans.

271
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,789
This is bad.

272
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,500
She's losing time.

273
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:18,650
Well, what are you going to do?

274
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,719
That guy. Is he doing that on purpose?

275
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,514
Harassing her nonstop.

276
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,058
What a jerk.

277
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,193
Kunimi amateur, five minutes remaining.

278
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,507
I got it.

279
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,325
Nice.

280
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,092
Great sound.

281
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,774
I resign.

282
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:41,204
After 145 moves,
Asuka Kunimi amateur, wins.

283
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,295
Yes!

284
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,422
Good!

285
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,809
Quite the glutton she is.

286
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,895
Don't you think so?

287
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,648
Master.

288
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,609
I'm not your apprentice anymore,

289
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,445
yet you are still trying to
teach me something.

290
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,866
Too bad.

291
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,702
I still won't be eating <i>daifuku</i>.

292
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,547
We're preparing for the next match.

293
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:52,108
Your style was unlike anyone
I've ever played with.

294
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,735
It was…

295
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,281
interesting.

296
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,410
Still want to be a <i>kishi</i>?

297
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,500
You'll have to face men
who are like monsters.

298
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,460
You won't make it.

299
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,712
Oh, I know.

300
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:16,299
A "wall that women can't overcome."

301
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:18,968
And…

302
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,346
Dad is at the top.

303
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,472
So what?

304
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,059
If it's too high to climb…

305
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,854
What, smash it?

306
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,689
No.

307
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,797
I'll use everyone as a stepping stone,

308
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,717
and rise above.

309
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,073
Thanks.

310
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,115
I'll be back.

311
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,576
Thank you so much. See you again.

312
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,661
See you.

313
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,008
You're Seigo Todou, right?

314
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,344
Yes?

315
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,222
Sorry to bother you.

316
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,432
My name is Shibata.

317
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,309
I write for the <i>Weekly Bunka.</i>

318
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,311
What?

319
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:57,692
So, could I ask some questions
about Asuka Kunimi?

320
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:04,115
Do you recognize
the person in this picture?

321
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:10,037
Is everything written
in this article true?

322
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,918
EXPELLED <i>KISHI</i> ATTEMPTED MURDER?

323
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,628
PLANNED REVENGE ON SHOICHI YUUKI

324
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:21,132
SCOOP! SECRET CHILD

325
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,901
<i>It's the biggest scandal ever.</i>

326
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,528
Why did you leak it?

327
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,364
Because it's more fun that way.

328
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,449
<i>It's blowing up.</i>

329
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:50,494
<i>If she wins three games,</i>
<i>she'll be the very first female </i>kishi<i>.</i>

330
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,912
Win all the games.

<i>That's the fastest way</i>
<i>to get to Shoichi Yuuki.</i>

332
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,459
Stop it!

333
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,045
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>people call me a terrorist now.</i>

334
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,004
<i>It sucks. It's your fault.</i>

335
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,547
<i>Kunimi amateur, lost two in a row.</i>

336
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,717
<i>Another loss, and she'll be disqualified.</i>
