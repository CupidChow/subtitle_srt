1
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:09,217
ROOK

2
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,262
<i>Stop…</i>

3
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:16,224
<i>Stop playing shogi…</i>

4
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:20,437
<i>Stop it.</i>

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,899
What's wrong?

6
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,111
<i>Stop playing…</i>

7
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,825
<i>Stop playing shogi…</i>

8
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:51,968
Asuka.

9
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:53,678
Asuka!

10
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,764
Asuka!

11
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,569
Are you okay?

12
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,823
What happened?

13
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,537
"Stop playing."

14
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,290
What?

15
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,421
"Stop playing shogi."

16
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,507
A voice said so.

17
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:32,967
Seriously?

18
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:33,927
Shut up.

19
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,514
All of a sudden…

20
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,851
the words on the pieces
started to warp in front of me.

21
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,943
Someone grabbed my hand…

22
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,864
and I couldn't move.

23
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,119
And then…

24
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,288
The voice said…

25
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,583
"Stop playing shogi."

26
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,896
That voice. Whose voice is it?

27
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,568
Who told you to stop playing shogi?

28
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:38,533
When I play shogi,
everyone ends up miserable.

29
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:50,128
Hey, cut that crap.

30
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,089
Ghosts? Voices in your head?

31
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,133
- What's this about, huh?
- Stop.

32
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,176
You hesitated in that moment.

33
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:02,140
You didn't know
how to handle the opponent's move.

34
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,227
You know why all of this happened?

35
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,773
It's because you're weak.

36
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,613
Stop blaming others.

37
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,366
You lost the winning line
because you're just weak!

38
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,202
Don't run away. I told you already.

39
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,963
When you're in a match, think only about
the opponent in front of you.

40
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,302
Mr. Todou. Ms. Reiko.

41
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,641
You'll also be miserable
if you keep me around.

42
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:53,733
Try making me any more miserable.

43
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,904
You're such a drama queen.

44
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:58,821
You fool.

45
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,085
Sorry, he was out of line with you.

46
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,338
He hasn't changed.

47
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,675
He turns into a hopeless fool
when it comes to shogi.

48
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:24,806
That's why he quit shogi.
Because of the stupid mess he caused.

49
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,350
He never learns.

50
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,107
Well…

51
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,027
You know…

52
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,905
He punched Shoichi Yuuki.

53
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,671
<i>So, he had to leave the world of shogi.</i>

54
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,715
And look at his woeful state now.

55
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,803
Why did he punch him?

56
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,806
Right?

57
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,935
You should ask him.

58
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,441
Sorry to say this, but…

59
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,070
I feel you two are alike.

60
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,990
You and Seigo.

61
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,663
I'll get you more water.

62
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,305
Put this piece here.

63
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,973
Over here…

64
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,894
Like this.

65
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:01,194
CLASS 2-3 TODOU

66
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,133
Good move.

67
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,345
You're strong, Seigo.

68
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,660
Dad? I won.

69
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,246
I'm a <i>kishi</i> now!

70
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,956
You did it!

71
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,583
Congratulations.

72
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,813
Dad. I'm in the Ohryu Title Match.

73
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,483
I'll play against Yuuki Ohryu.

74
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,362
You can do it…

75
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,782
You can win the title…

76
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,869
and become the Ohryu champion.

77
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,857
Asuka? I'm almost done cleaning up.

78
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,400
You can rest--

79
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,795
Wait, wait, wait.

80
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,884
Hey, not even a goodbye?

81
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,387
I…

82
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,767
I'm quitting shogi.

83
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,894
How come?

84
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,772
I…

85
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,566
I just don't want to anymore.

86
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,820
I see.

87
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,246
Seigo did the same.

88
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,416
After he punched Shoichi Yuuki,
he ran away.

89
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:07,213
He acted like quitting shogi
was the end of his life.

90
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,800
He shouldn't have punched him then.

91
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,721
But he was also--

92
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,852
Even if you quit shogi…

93
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,855
you can still stay.

94
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,071
It's okay.

95
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,408
Thank you for everything.

96
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,206
Come back anytime, okay?

97
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:21,329
Rook on 2-4. Pawn on 2-3.
Knight promotes. Silver.

98
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,125
ROOK

99
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,799
<i>Stop…</i>

100
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,970
<i>Stop playing shogi.</i>

101
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,556
<i>Stop it.</i>

102
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,683
<i>Stop playing…</i>

103
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,893
<i>Stop playing shogi…</i>

104
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:33,776
I'm sorry, Mom.

105
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:36,779
I'm sorry.

106
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,129
Here we go.

107
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,882
Asuka left.

108
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,719
So she ran away.

109
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,723
You're running away too.

110
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,187
You talked Asuka into it.

111
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:15,484
Weren't you going to team up and
kill Shoichi Yuuki with shogi?

112
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:20,573
And now you're giving up on her already,
after just stumbling a bit?

113
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,159
Is your resolve that weak?

114
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,874
Seriously. I can't take this anymore.

115
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:36,338
I'm done with you and shogi. Leave.

116
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:38,924
No.

117
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,427
I mean it.

118
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,681
What the hell?

119
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,144
Until you bring Asuka back with you…

120
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,730
don't come back.

121
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,702
YUUKI

122
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,212
- You're home.
- Hey.

123
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,255
You left so quickly. Where were you?

124
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,715
At the Shogi Association.

125
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:20,841
I see.

126
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,094
Is that Dad's old game record?

127
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,016
No, this is Asuka's game
from today's Amateur Meioh Match.

128
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,689
You see it too, don't you? Her style…

129
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:39,652
She's a Central Rook player
just like your father used to be.

130
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,117
Is she aiming to become a <i>kishi</i>?

131
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,375
That can't be. A <i>joryu kishi</i>, maybe.

132
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,755
Why? Is something wrong?

133
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:03,175
Oh, right. You know her.

134
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,520
She's my sister.

135
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,355
What?

136
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:25,072
Look. This is security footage from
Dad's Ho-oh Match.

137
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,950
She's holding a knife.

138
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,327
Is this Asuka?

139
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,373
Yeah. Asuka Kunimi is Dad's…

140
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,043
She's his previous wife's daughter.

141
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:41,714
And…

142
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,093
she tried to kill him.

143
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,454
There you are.

144
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,957
I heard you left.
But you didn't get too far, did you?

145
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,921
I have nowhere to go.

146
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,549
True.

147
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,781
Hey, do you like shogi?

148
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,998
Well, I don't. I hate it.

149
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,710
I can't stop thinking about it,
no matter what.

150
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,963
It's always there. It pisses me off.

151
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,676
But playing is so much fun,

152
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,512
so I can't quit.

153
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,223
You're also--

154
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,075
Why did you attack Shoichi Yuuki?

155
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,161
What? Because I was pissed.

156
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,590
The day before the Ohryu Match with him,

157
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,010
my dad died.

158
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,099
My state of mind was an absolute mess.

159
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,406
I resign.

160
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:24,918
I apologize for playing
such a pathetic game.

161
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,088
Actually…

162
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,468
my father passed away last night.

163
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:41,268
He was really looking forward
to my game with you, sir.

164
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,065
I wanted to give my best for him, but…

165
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,235
Mr. Yuuki…

166
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,947
I was honored to challenge you
in this Ohryu Match.

167
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,243
My father would've been happy.

168
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,499
I promise I'll be better next--

169
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,875
You…

170
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,005
You're not cut out for shogi.

171
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:13,842
What?

172
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,931
I'm so sorry…

173
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,060
about your father.

174
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,815
You're strong, Seigo.

175
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,525
I'm a <i>kishi </i>now!

176
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,027
<i>You can do it…</i>

177
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,738
<i>You can win the title and</i>
<i>become the Ohryu champion.</i>

178
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,746
- Mr. Todou!
- Mr. Yuuki! Are you alright?

179
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,373
- Sir.
- Please stop!

180
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,624
Calm down!

181
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,000
Mr. Todou!

182
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,929
And you quit shogi?

183
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,267
He was right after all.

184
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,061
How lame is that?

185
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,062
Very lame.

186
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:14,069
What about you?
You play shogi in constant fear.

187
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,696
That's lame too.

188
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,877
After he left us…

189
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,797
whenever I played shogi…

190
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,509
my mom looked pained.

191
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,640
That's why…

192
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,644
I quit playing.

193
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,152
At the tournament…

194
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,280
My opponent…

195
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,742
His face…

196
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,079
turned into Mom's.

197
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,344
I see.

198
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,022
That's nice. You get to see her ghost.

199
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,818
Unlike me.

200
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:44,660
I bet your mom came back
as a ghost to cheer you on.

201
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,914
Just saying.

202
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,116
Apparently, we are alike.

203
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,410
What?

204
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,162
Ms. Reiko told me.

205
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,331
How?

206
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,917
I don't know.

207
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:41,967
Oh, but we have this in common.
Reiko kicked us both out.

208
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,136
No, she didn't kick me out.

209
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,637
Oh, really?

210
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,365
Hey, where are you going?

211
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:10,996
Back to Ms. Reiko's.
She told me to come back anytime.

212
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,373
Great. I'll tag along too.

213
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,125
Are you allowed back?

214
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,002
Yes. With you I am.

215
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,465
Alright. Want to play when we get back?

216
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,717
Nope.

217
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,254
Do you not want me to play shogi?

218
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:03,965
Mom…

219
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:22,400
ROOK

220
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,814
Wake up.

221
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,733
I'm awake.

222
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,570
Let's go then.

223
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,332
My dad's ashes.

224
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,581
I…

225
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:06,004
I blamed it on my dad
when I lost against Shoichi Yuuki.

226
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,967
I put a curse on myself…

227
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,011
and I ran.

228
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,689
I lost because I was too weak.

229
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:45,168
Try making me any more miserable.

230
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,099
I'm sorry.

231
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,061
Dad.

232
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,867
Hey, Asuka Kunimi.

233
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,329
You are strong.

234
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,001
You'll get even stronger.

235
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:33,300
From now on, we are here to support you.

236
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:36,761
I promise, we'll get you stronger.

237
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,433
Forget what your mom wanted.

238
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,101
It's your life.

239
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,523
It's too early to resign.

240
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:30,482
Hey, that's my dad!
Why did you scatter him?

241
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:34,652
I don't know!

242
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:35,987
What?!

243
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,205
Welcome home.

244
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,468
Wash up and have breakfast.

245
00:28:54,274 --> 00:29:00,196
AMATEUR KISHO MATCH, FINALS

246
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,753
ROOK

247
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:19,758
I resign.

248
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:15,480
ASUKA KUNIMI

249
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:39,254
<i>I'll become a </i>kishi
<i>and beat Shoichi Yuuki.</i>

250
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,922
<i>Women can only go so far.</i>

251
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,340
<i>Me, becoming a </i>kishi<i>?</i>

252
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,967
There's no way!

253
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,802
<i>Her strength is real.</i>

254
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:48,972
<i>We never know if we will win or lose.</i>

255
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,890
- Are you mocking me?
- I'm not.

256
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:51,766
<i>I'll kill him with shogi.</i>

257
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,685
I knew it. You're crazy in the head.

258
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:54,936
This is getting interesting!

259
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,105
<i>Straight-up fist fight. It's her thing.</i>

260
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,982
<i>I'll destroy you tomorrow.</i>

261
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,693
I look forward to it.

00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:02,652
