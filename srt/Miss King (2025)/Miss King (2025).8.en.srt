1
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,177
As for Asuka Kunimi…

2
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:16,057
we will continue her <i>kishi</i> admission test.

3
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:22,021
However, I will be personally serving…

4
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:27,318
as the examiner for the final match.

5
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,309
Shoichi Yuuki's memoir.

6
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:03,813
These are the pages I removed
from the manuscript.

7
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,319
SHOICHI YUUKI

8
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,743
This part was

9
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,205
dedicated to you and your mother.

10
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:22,957
What?

11
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,378
I will give my all…

12
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,424
to defeat Asuka Kunimi.

13
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:09,087
We should end this. All of it.

14
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,576
KEIKO AND ASUKA.

15
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:27,832
I LEFT THE TWO OF THEM,
MY MOST BELOVED FAMILY.

16
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,382
I went to meet Asuka Kunimi.

17
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:45,892
I gave her the part of your memoir
about the Kunimi family.

18
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,605
For what?

19
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,319
For the Yuuki family.

20
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,367
I see.

21
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,918
That day…

22
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,798
my life as a <i>kishi</i> ended once.

23
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:25,765
<i>It was the time when I went over a year</i>
<i>without a single win.</i>

24
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,977
<i>I was on the verge of retiring.</i>

25
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,068
I resign.

26
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,695
Thank you.

27
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,281
<i>Day by day, my confidence crumbled.</i>

28
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,950
<i>I was afraid of the young talents.</i>

29
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,369
<i>As a </i>kishi<i>,</i>

30
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,539
<i>my career was about to hit rock bottom.</i>

31
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,293
<i>What was I missing?</i>

32
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,629
<i>I couldn't figure it out.</i>

33
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,049
<i>I was alone…</i>

34
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,303
<i>falling deeper and deeper.</i>

35
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:09,058
<i>Still, I could go home</i>
<i>to my beloved family.</i>

36
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,353
<i>My wife and daughter</i>

37
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,982
<i>eased the loneliness</i>
<i>I was constantly feeling.</i>

38
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:22,822
<i>Even though their presence made me happy</i>,

39
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:28,703
<i>a darker thought crept in</i>
<i>and occupied my mind.</i>

40
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:35,877
<i>"If they were not here,</i>
<i>I'd be able to focus on shogi."</i>

41
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:41,549
<i>"Could it be that</i>
<i>I keep losing because of them?"</i>

42
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,933
<i>And then,</i>

43
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,352
<i>that day came.</i>

44
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,359
Oh Dad! Look!

45
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:06,282
I'm good now. I want to play with you.

46
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,748
ASUKA KUNIMI
WINNER OF CHILDREN'S SHOGI TOURNAMENT

47
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,417
Dad, you promised…

48
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,258
Don't touch my shogi set!

49
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:39,190
<i>That day,</i>
<i>my seven-year-old daughter found the move</i>

50
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,735
<i>I was searching for my entire life.</i>

51
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,822
<i>The ultimate move.</i>

52
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,869
<i>It was no coincidence.</i>

53
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,914
<i>I knew for certain then.</i>

54
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,250
<i>Asuka was…</i>

55
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,088
<i>a genius with a gift</i>
<i>that far surpassed me.</i>

56
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:08,469
<i>That realization didn't bring me joy.</i>

57
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,305
<i>Instead, I was shaken to the core.</i>

58
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,144
<i>My daughter, at seven, already had a gift.</i>

59
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:20,356
<i>I was jealous and scared.</i>

60
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,244
<i>What I saw in the mirror was a monster.</i>

61
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,790
<i>A monster cursed by shogi.</i>

62
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,713
<i>And I knew that</i>
<i>if I stayed with my wife and daughter,</i>

63
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:49,552
<i>I would, without a doubt,</i>
<i>make them miserable.</i>

64
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,180
<i>That's when I decided.</i>

65
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,764
DIVORCE APPLICATION

66
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,349
I don't care anymore…

67
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,643
about you,

68
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:00,980
or Asuka.

69
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,490
You should…

70
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,117
stop playing shogi.

71
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,626
<i>This is right.</i>

72
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:26,756
<i>With this, I will be strong.</i>

73
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,469
<i>I can finally become stronger.</i>

74
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,648
<i>I had no other choice</i>
<i>but to live as a monster.</i>

75
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,068
<i>Keiko and Asuka.</i>

76
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,279
<i>I left the two of them…</i>

77
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,407
<i>my most beloved family.</i>

78
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,457
And then, I met you.

79
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,753
You gave me a new life as Shoichi Yuuki.

80
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,720
But it's all over now.

81
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,058
Once you retire,
it's the end for the Yuuki family.

82
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,575
I wonder what Asuka felt
while reading this.

83
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,247
She's hated her father for abandoning her.

84
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,000
That has driven her
to keep fighting, right?

85
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,877
But now…

86
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,176
Hey.

87
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:58,014
Isn't there any way
for Asuka and Shoichi to make up?

88
00:09:58,848 --> 00:09:59,724
Why should they?

89
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,808
Because…

90
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,227
they're family, right?

91
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:08,190
Wouldn't they want to get along
rather than fight?

92
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,249
<i>Mom.</i>

93
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,211
Are you that scared of
losing Dad to Asuka Kunimi?

94
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,007
Think of your age.

95
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:36,594
Shoichi this, Shoichi that.
You're obsessed with him.

96
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,973
Do you ever think of anything else?

97
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,186
Hey.

98
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,606
What about me?

99
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,319
Do you even see me?

100
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,245
Hey.

101
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:10,169
Do you know why
I leaked the footage to the tabloids?

102
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,381
You don't get it, do you?

103
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,511
Because Dad is all you think about.

104
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,185
Why?

105
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,523
Is it because I'm weak?

106
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,235
Because I'm not as good as Dad?

107
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,533
Can't you just look at me?

108
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,456
Say something!

109
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,417
Tatsuya.

110
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,520
Don't speak to your parent like that.

111
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,234
Parent?

112
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:22,116
Then act like one
and don't neglect your kid.

113
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,846
I'm sorry.

114
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,978
I'm sorry.

115
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,699
What's up?

116
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,659
Thinking about dying again?

117
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,164
Don't you have anywhere else to go?

118
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,333
Mr. Todou.

119
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:18,464
Sorry, but I went ahead and read this.

120
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,055
"Keiko and Asuka."

121
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,057
"My most beloved family."

122
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,312
I don't know what to say.

123
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,442
What did you think when you read this?

124
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,321
What about you?

125
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,073
What did you think?

126
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,578
As someone who

127
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,831
was also cursed by shogi,

128
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,877
I understood how he felt.

129
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,797
Sadly.

130
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,717
I don't have my own family.

131
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,889
But if I did,
I might've made the same decision.

132
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:16,772
Of course, that doesn't change the fact
that he abandoned you.

133
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,359
But…

134
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:26,824
once you know the truth,
it hits different.

135
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,248
<i>You and your mother were…</i>

136
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,586
both loved by him.

137
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,838
Unlike me.

138
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,050
So…

139
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,096
there's no need for you to hate him.

140
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,642
There's no point in taking revenge.

141
00:14:56,145 --> 00:15:00,482
We should end this. All of it.

142
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,781
Please…

143
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,827
Don't take Shoichi away from us.

144
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,881
"Keiko and Asuka."

145
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,468
"My most beloved family."

146
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,138
Yeah.

147
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,602
I wonder…

148
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:43,317
what Mom would've thought
if she read this.

149
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:45,778
MOST BELOVED FAMILY

150
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,491
As for me…

151
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,955
When I read those words…

152
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:08,634
I was so pissed!

153
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,219
What?!

154
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,430
He ruined everything for me and my mom.

155
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,017
How dare he say those things now?

156
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,520
Shogi monster? Are you kidding me?

157
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,399
He's so full of himself!

158
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,986
A super self-obsessed and selfish bastard,
that's what he is!

159
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,071
But--

160
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,197
Mr. Todou.

161
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:35,869
This is a family feud.

162
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,124
I don't care what other people think.

163
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:45,796
Even if the whole country sides with him,
I will never forgive him.

164
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,633
He put my mom and I in such misery.

165
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,720
So I'll deny him with all I've got.

166
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:01,061
Thanks to those pages,
I've made up my mind.

167
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,358
I won't become a <i>kishi!</i>

168
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,612
I'll crush him, and then quit shogi!

169
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,452
Mom.

170
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,581
I'm going to end it all.

171
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,841
The whole nation
is on Shoichi Yuuki's side.

172
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,595
I don't care.

173
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,350
We are villains after all.

174
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,859
That’s fine with me.

175
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,237
Let them all be enemies.

176
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,075
Asuka.

177
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,661
You'll be fine. You're strong.

178
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:45,541
I'll be by your side
all the way to the end of hell.

179
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,256
Let's beat up your dad.

180
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,136
Yeah.

181
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:08,021
<i>KISHI</i> ADMISSION TEST, BEST OF FIVE
FINAL GAME

182
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,575
Is she not here yet?

183
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,827
- What's she doing?
- Anyone talked to her?

184
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,497
<i>It seems like amateur Asuka Kunimi</i>
<i>has not arrived yet.</i>

185
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,084
<i>The media has been all over her.</i>

186
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,462
<i>That must've been quite a huge toll</i>
<i>on her mental health.</i>

187
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:36,383
<i>It's possible</i>
<i>she might choose to lose by default.</i>

188
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,803
<i>The whole country's eyes</i>
<i>are on this </i>kishi<i> admission test.</i>

189
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,139
<i>What will happen today?</i>

190
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,141
Will she show up?

191
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,727
She will.

192
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,496
Well,

193
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,457
let's begin.

194
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,505
<i>It is now the scheduled time.</i>

195
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,591
<i>The final game of</i>
<i>the </i>kishi<i> admission test, best of five.</i>

196
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,260
Please begin the match.

197
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:15,607
<i>Amateur Asuka Kunimi.</i>
<i>Her opening move is rook to 5-8.</i>

198
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,009
KING

199
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,635
<i>Mino Castle.</i>

200
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,723
I see he's not holding back at all.

201
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,976
We need him to win
to maintain his honor as the chairman.

202
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,687
Looks like a solid start.

203
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,982
Hit him!

204
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,762
<i>Knight takes on 8-5.</i>

205
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,930
<i>Amateur Kunimi is on the offensive.</i>

206
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:33,018
<i>Looks like she'll keep pushing here.</i>

207
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,106
<i>Asuka, I'm sorry.</i>

208
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,858
All this time…

209
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,527
<i>I've burdened you.</i>

210
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,447
I don't care anymore about you,

211
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,491
<i>or Asuka.</i>

212
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,785
Stop playing shogi.

213
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,339
<i>Why…</i>

214
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,257
<i>do you want to see him?</i>

215
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,636
Because…

216
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,140
we're family.

217
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,980
<i>My mom is dying.</i>

218
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,440
So…

219
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:21,942
Please!

220
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,111
<i>Please let me see my Dad!</i>

221
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:27,447
<i>I need to tell him about her! Please!</i>

222
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,291
<i>Amateur Kunimi promotes a pawn to 9-1.</i>

223
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,294
<i>Closing in on Yuuki 9-dan's throat!</i>

224
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,754
<i>Why?</i>

225
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,300
<i>For a bastard like this…</i>

226
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,704
<i>Pawn to 8-1. Check.</i>

227
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,622
<i>Amateur Kunimi is attacking relentlessly.</i>

228
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,459
You can do it.

229
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:26,047
<i>He's in a tough spot.</i>
<i>She's forcing him to retreat.</i>

230
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,466
<i>An unbelievable turn of events!</i>

231
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:33,889
<i>Amateur Kunimi's relentless attacks</i>
<i>seem to be overwhelming Yuuki 9-dan.</i>

232
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,027
<i>Yuuki 9-dan plays promoted bishop to 5-6.</i>

233
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,529
<i>He takes amateur Kunimi's rook.</i>

234
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,241
<i>With that, he's stopped her attacks.</i>

235
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,120
<i>Yuuki 9-dan has completely</i>
<i>turned around the game.</i>

236
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,751
<i>Amateur Kunimi responds with gold to 5-6.</i>

237
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,296
<i>That's exactly</i>
<i>what Yuuki 9-dan had anticipated.</i>

238
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:15,096
<i>Yuuki 9-dan moves silver to 2-8. Check.</i>

239
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:25,774
<i>Amateur Kunimi flees with king to 4-8.</i>
<i>She looks troubled.</i>

240
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,359
Damn.

241
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,152
What's going on?

242
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,571
He really is a monster.

243
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,989
He's strong.

244
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,203
<i>The tables have completely turned.</i>

245
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,623
<i>Looks like Yuuki 9-dan</i>
<i>is launching a skillful attack.</i>

246
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,959
<i>Amateur Kunimi is the one under siege now…</i>

247
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,671
<i>Yuuki 9-dan moves promoted knight to 5-8.</i>

248
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,256
<i>Check again.</i>

249
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,383
<i>Kunimi's in a really tough spot now.</i>

250
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:55,720
<i>Defense looks almost impossible.</i>
<i>Is it over for her?</i>

251
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,597
That's it, isn't it?

252
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,432
Impressive.

253
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,643
Remarkable as usual.

254
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,817
That's it? Is she going to lose?

255
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:34,551
<i>Maybe I was always hoping</i>
<i>for this day to come.</i>

256
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,476
What's wrong, Asuka? Is this the end?

257
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,408
What's wrong, Asuka?

258
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,287
Is this the end?

259
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,625
You can fly higher.

260
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,256
Fly.

261
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:26,936
<i>She's holding on.</i>
<i>Amateur Kunimi escapes with her king.</i>

262
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,938
That's right. Don't stop.

263
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,649
Keep going, no matter how unsightly.

264
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,987
<i>She managed here,</i>
<i>but she's not out of danger yet.</i>

265
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:46,664
<i>Lance to 5-7.</i>
<i>Amateur Kunimi is getting cornered.</i>

266
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,833
<i>She's in an extremely tight position.</i>

267
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:52,003
<i>Amateur Kunimi's gold</i>
<i>takes and retreats to 5-7.</i>

268
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,423
<i>Yuuki 9-dan moves gold to 4-8.</i>

269
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,509
<i>A crushing check!</i>

270
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,804
I can't watch anymore!

271
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,765
<i>He struck the critical point.</i>

272
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,059
<i>She can't run upward now.</i>
<i>It's looking rough.</i>

273
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,685
Don't give up.

274
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,355
You can do it.

275
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:36,005
<i>Yuuki 9-dan moves bishop to 8-7. Check.</i>

276
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:40,510
<i>He's cornered her with the rook</i>
<i>and bishop. There's no way out.</i>

277
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,119
It's not over yet!

278
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,496
How obstinate.

279
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,900
<i>Bishop to 8-5. Check.</i>

280
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,945
She turned it around!

281
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,990
<i>A sudden reversal.</i>

282
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,034
<i>Yuuki 9-dan was caught off guard.</i>

283
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,035
<i>Yes!</i>

284
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,661
Go!

285
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:52,600
Go!

286
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,623
Get him!

287
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,023
Go.

288
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:40,982
Go.

289
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:45,987
Take him down!

290
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,032
ROOK

291
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:57,832
Asuka. This is your piece.

292
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,044
It travels freely as it wishes.

293
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:19,103
ROOK

294
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:36,704
ROOK

295
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,665
I resign.

296
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:22,834
<i>He resigns!</i>

297
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:25,545
<i>Yuuki 9-dan bows his head.</i>
<i>After 129 moves--</i>

298
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:28,715
- She won!
<i>- Asuka Kunimi's stunning comeback!</i>

299
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,258
She really did it.

300
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:34,470
<i>The final game of the </i>kishi<i> admission test</i>
<i>ends with amateur Asuka Kunimi's win!</i>

301
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,889
<i>She makes history</i>
<i>as the first female </i>kishi<i>.</i>

302
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,392
- She did it!
<i>- This is truly an epoch-making moment!</i>

303
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,894
- Amazing!
<i>- What an incredible turn of events!</i>

304
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:46,607
<i>Indeed, a historic match to mark</i>
<i>the birth of the first female </i>kishi<i>.</i>

305
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:52,030
<i>That part aside,</i>
<i>she's simply an incredible player.</i>

306
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,614
- She did it!
<i>- She'll make history.</i>

307
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,577
<i>We have just witnessed</i>
<i>the birth of a phenomenal player!</i>

308
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,486
You've become so strong.

309
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,532
Asuka.

310
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,621
I was right,
you're not cut out to be a <i>kishi</i>.

311
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,792
But you're a great teacher.

312
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,378
I can tell by looking at her now.

313
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,257
Yes.

314
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,634
She is a great student.

315
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,139
Take care of Asuka.

316
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,724
I'm sorry.

317
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,186
No…

318
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,816
Thank you for everything.

319
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,511
You did it!

320
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,057
Oh.

321
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,226
Yeah.

322
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:13,105
That's all? Aren't you excited?

323
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,986
I thought it would feel more cathartic…

324
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:27,912
But I think I said all I needed to.

325
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,332
I see.

326
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,378
It was a great family feud.

327
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,096
It was fun!

328
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,103
Shall we go home?

329
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,605
Yes.

330
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,321
I take full responsibility…

331
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,950
for all the scandals.

332
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,915
As of today,

333
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:17,295
I resign as the chairman
of the shogi association…

334
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,717
and retire from being a <i>kishi</i>.

335
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,261
Chairman Yuuki.

336
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:28,514
Thank you for all your hard work
over the years as a<i> kishi</i>.

337
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,684
"The end" of a <i>kishi</i>…

338
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:37,857
Shoichi Yuuki retires
and the first female <i>kishi</i> is born.

339
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,901
Times are changing.

340
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,611
Yes.

341
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,490
Our time is over.

342
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,411
What are you saying?

343
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,750
It is the other way around.

344
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,461
Your time begins now.

345
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,104
Ms. Asuka Kunimi.

346
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,274
You've accomplished
becoming the first female <i>kishi</i>.

347
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:24,153
How do you feel after the final game?

348
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,199
Well…

349
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:33,788
Shogi is really

350
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,165
annoying.

351
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,460
So that's why,

352
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,836
I'm quitting.

353
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,005
- What?
- Quitting?!

354
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,884
<i>- Why? You finally made it!</i>
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

355
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:56,977
TWO YEARS LATER

356
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,527
Can I order, please?

357
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,903
Just a moment.

358
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,197
Okay.

359
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:10,741
Well!

360
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,535
Look here!

361
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,161
Thank you for waiting.

362
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:18,124
You see, Daddy's working
to pay for your milk.

363
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,543
I have a title match coming up.
I can't lose!

364
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,336
That is my main job!

365
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,756
Bring in money,
and you'll have the right to talk.

366
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,428
- Seriously!
- What would you like?

367
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,096
Konrads' spaghetti, please.

368
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,431
- One?
- Yes.

369
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,183
- Yes, let me know.
- Reiko.

370
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,601
Turn the TV on!

371
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:38,686
Oh, right!

372
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,021
- One spaghetti?
- Yes.

373
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,314
Okay.

374
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,373
Tatsuya.

375
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,125
What?

376
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,630
Want to play?

377
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,175
It's been a while.

378
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,175
It's starting soon.

379
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,613
It's almost time.

380
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,577
I know. She'll be here soon.

381
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,537
Noted.

382
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,209
What's taking so long?

383
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,132
Oh, you'll go there?

384
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:36,470
Then how about this?

385
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:39,890
There you are.

386
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:42,476
And…

387
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,425
Great move.

388
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,677
Got complimented by a <i>kishi</i>!

389
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:21,807
What are you doing here?
Don't you have the Ohryu Title Match?

390
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,225
I'll go after this.

391
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,935
Hey, master.

392
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,605
Your opponent's already waiting!

393
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:35,738
Shoot. Don't move a piece!

394
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:39,283
- Hey!
- You forgot your bag!

395
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,328
Good luck!

396
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:43,454
It won't take long!

397
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,647
I'm sorry I'm late!

398
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,982
What were you doing?

399
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:16,862
Well…

400
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,408
I was playing shogi.

401
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,998
Hurry. Get ready.

402
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,124
Yes!

403
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:55,067
We will now begin
the first game of the Ohryu Title Match.

404
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:05,035
<i>Shogi is really</i>

405
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,662
annoying.

406
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:11,333
So that's why, I'm quitting!

407
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,419
- What?
- Quitting?!

408
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:16,797
- Why? You finally made it!
- What do you mean?

409
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,006
But…

410
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,052
because it's annoying…

411
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,811
it's <i>super</i>

412
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:31,979
fun!

413
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,773
Fun?

414
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,450
Right?

415
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,972
Let's have a good game.

416
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,524
ROOK

417
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:32,748
