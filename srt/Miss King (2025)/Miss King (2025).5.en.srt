1
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:22,647
Wow! Such a lovely place!

2
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,109
Why are you tagging along?

3
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,652
I'm paying for the trip.

4
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,072
Be grateful that I've even let you
carry my luggage.

5
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,869
Hey, did you just click your tongue?
You did, didn't you?

6
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,037
Nope, I didn't.

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,996
You did.

8
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,166
SOKEI CUP ROOKIE LEAGUE 2025

9
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,626
Let's go.

10
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,712
Hey, wait.

11
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,842
Everyone looks so young.

12
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:54,012
The Rookie League
is a gateway for young talents,

13
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:58,016
only open for new <i>kishi</i>,
<i>joryu kishi</i>, and amateur representatives.

14
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,352
But age doesn't matter in shogi.

15
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,146
They're all monsters-to-be.

16
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,190
Did you meet Mr. Tatsuya through shogi?

17
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,691
Yes, it's a shogi marriage.

18
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,734
Oh, wow.

19
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,320
How did Mr. Tatsuya propose to you?

20
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,198
Oh, I'm too shy.

21
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,201
It's a secret.

22
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,205
By the way, my new photobook
will be released soon.

23
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,623
Please check it out!

24
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,211
Will you keep playing as a <i>joryu</i>
even after marriage?

25
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,545
What?

26
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,673
Some fans are hoping
you'll become the first female <i>kishi</i>.

27
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,427
Though realistically,
that would be very unlikely.

28
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,930
The shogi world
is full of skilled male players.

29
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,267
What do you think?

30
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,770
Well…

31
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,855
Me, becoming a <i>kishi</i>?

32
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,857
There's no way!

33
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,444
Please show us your ring.

34
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,030
She's competing too…

35
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,409
Could you look this way?

36
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,745
Thank you so much.

37
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:10,588
SOKEI CUP ROOKIE LEAGUE DAY ONE

38
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,576
SAYURI KIMURA VS. ASUKA KUNIMI

39
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,910
<i>I resign.</i>

40
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,539
She did it!

41
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,046
YUNA HAYAMI VS. CHIHIRO TAKAHAMA

42
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,339
<i>I resign.</i>

43
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,267
Yuna Hayami is retiring?

44
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,479
Yeah. She's going to quit
once the marriage is sealed.

45
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,733
I'd say she was just
a short-term idol player after all…

46
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,444
if she wasn't the real deal.

47
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,863
Her strength is real.

48
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,079
She's strong.

49
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:29,125
Yeah. Despite her looks,
her style is very by the book.

50
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,877
What do you mean?

51
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,546
It shows that she's relentlessly
dedicated to shogi.

52
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,204
<i>Maybe Asuka didn't want us around.</i>

53
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,499
- You think?
- Yeah.

54
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,629
This time,
she's even more fired up than usual.

55
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,173
Didn't you see today?

56
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,258
See what?

57
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,927
Her outfit!

58
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,929
What about her outfit?

59
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,973
She looked different!

60
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,392
Really?

61
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,645
Men are truly hopeless.

62
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:36,234
She saved up the prize money
and her pay from my place

63
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,612
to buy new clothes.

64
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,700
Usually, she just borrows mine.

65
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,121
Well…

66
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,207
Sometimes, I wonder…

67
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,878
if this is the right path for her.

68
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,051
I mean, with the whole "revenge" thing.

69
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:09,225
Girls at her age usually want to
enjoy a more glamorous life, right?

70
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,146
Like that Yuna Hayami.

71
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,907
Asuka's outfit today was…

72
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,660
so cute.

73
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,542
Is that my game record?

74
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,130
Oh. Yes.

75
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,799
Whoa, scary. You're studying me.

76
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,473
Wait, does that mean…

77
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,309
you're planning to clear the league?

78
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,687
Yes, and I will beat you in the final--

79
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,898
I didn't ask about that.

80
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,860
Sorry.

81
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,825
But you know, even if you beat me…

82
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,619
Hypothetically, I mean.

83
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:10,787
What's next?

84
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,666
I'll become a <i>kishi</i>…

85
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,921
and beat Shoichi Yuuki.

86
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,971
I see.

87
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:31,808
Yes.

88
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,492
So…

89
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,869
What?

90
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,664
Are you really…

91
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,541
retiring?

92
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,627
What's with you?

93
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,005
But you're so strong.

94
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,260
Strong?

95
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,804
Me?

96
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,058
Do you…

97
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,395
really believe that?

98
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,823
Sorry, forget it.

99
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,034
Good night.

100
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,373
Good night.

101
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:17,663
SOKEI CUP ROOKIE LEAGUE DAY TWO

102
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:48,694
How did I know that he was the one?
That's a hard question.

103
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,949
Why don't you ask me
about tomorrow's finals instead?

104
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,994
It's Asuka Kunimi!

105
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,496
- Ms. Kunimi!
- What?

106
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,623
- Congratulations on being a finalist!
- Oh.

107
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,044
Thank you.

108
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,089
As of today, you have eight wins
in the official matches.

109
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,423
Yes.

110
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,717
Are you aiming for the
<i>kishi</i> admission test?

111
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,346
- Oh, yes.
- You could be the very first female <i>kishi</i>!

112
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,974
What about it?

113
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,726
How does it feel to be making history?

114
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,689
Well…

115
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,776
- Come with me.
- What?

116
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,115
- Get in!
- What? Oh, okay.

117
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,408
Just a few words please!

118
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,451
- Please start driving.
- Sure.

119
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:41,789
Ms. Kunimi!

120
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,207
A word please!

121
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,834
- One comment!
- Please!

122
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,252
Give us a minute!

123
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,213
Thanks.

124
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,466
Those flies are so annoying.

125
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,226
So, where are we going?

126
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,230
Hang out with me for a bit.

127
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,690
What?

128
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,247
Thank you for waiting.

129
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,250
Here's your drink.

130
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,463
Sherry. It's their specialty.

131
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,716
But I don't drink.

132
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,053
It's nothing. Have a glass with me.

133
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,933
Since tomorrow will be my last game.

134
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,152
Cheers.

135
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,154
Cheers.

136
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:14,965
So…

137
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:19,220
Are you serious about becoming a <i>kishi</i>?

138
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,805
I am.

139
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,852
Do you understand how hard it is?

140
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,524
- Yes.
- No.

141
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,859
No, you don't.

142
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,504
Do you think I'm happy,
playing as a <i>joryu kishi</i>?

143
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,385
I failed.

144
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,764
I started training in the Shoreikai
ever since I was a child.

145
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,142
I dreamed of becoming a <i>kishi</i>.

146
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,688
But I couldn't beat those monsters.

147
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,360
I'm a woman after all.

148
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,447
There's a wall I can't overcome.

149
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,002
What a waste.

150
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,754
What?

151
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,548
You're really strong.

152
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,053
Hey. Stop talking
like you know everything.

153
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,974
You don't understand the reality yet.

154
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,018
Reality?

155
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,271
Women can only go so far.

156
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,356
You'll see it one day.

157
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,776
I doubt it.

158
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,487
What?

159
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,865
Maybe that day…

160
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,034
will never come.

161
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:08,871
Well…

162
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:15,544
I'm really just speaking my mind.

163
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,004
Are you mocking me?

164
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,965
I'm not.

165
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,679
I knew it. You're crazy in the head.

166
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,348
What do you mean?

167
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,976
It's not normal to try to kill someone.

168
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,690
I've given up on that.

169
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,236
Someone told me that

170
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,198
you can't kill a <i>kishi</i> with a knife.

171
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,744
You can only kill them with shogi.

172
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,705
What?

173
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:57,962
So, you're planning to become a <i>kishi</i>
to beat Shoichi Yuuki?

174
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,505
Yes.

175
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,715
I'll kill him with shogi.

176
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:08,055
You're seriously deranged.

177
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,810
How could you win against Shoichi Yuuki?

178
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,397
He's at the very top of the shogi world.

179
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,025
Why not?

180
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:27,950
We never know if we will win or lose.

181
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,457
This is going nowhere.

182
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,211
You just don't get it.

183
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,592
But I've decided.

184
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,681
I'll destroy you tomorrow.

185
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,689
I look forward to it.

186
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,790
Welcome back. You stayed out late.

187
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,757
He was up waiting.

188
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,136
Was he upset?

189
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,433
He wanted you to rest.

190
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,203
<i>Does the reception seating chart</i>
<i>look okay to you?</i>

191
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,960
<i>Are you listening, Yuna?</i>

192
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,633
What if I said I don't want to retire?

193
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,386
<i>What?</i>

194
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:17,059
Just kidding.
Let's sort out the seating chart.

195
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:25,776
<i>Ms. Kunimi!</i>

196
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,653
<i>Congratulations on being a finalist!</i>

197
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,654
<i>What?</i>

198
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,365
ASUKA KUNIMI DETERMINED
TO BECOME THE FIRST FEMALE KISHI

199
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,825
<i>Thank you.</i>

200
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,703
<i>As of today, you have eight wins</i>
<i>in the official matches.</i>

201
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,329
<i>Yes.</i>

202
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,748
<i>Are you aiming for the</i>
kishi <i>admission test?</i>

203
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,666
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

204
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,793
<i>You could be the very first female </i>kishi<i>!</i>

205
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,588
<i>What about it?</i>

206
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,674
<i>How does it feel to be making history?</i>

207
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,974
DAY THREE FINALS

208
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:53,739
As it is the scheduled time,
please begin the game.

209
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,911
- Let's have a good match.
- Yes.

210
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,798
ROOK

211
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,348
Hey. What's going on?

212
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,351
Yuna Hayami is leading at this point.

213
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,061
What?

214
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,230
She's changed.

215
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,710
Asuka Kunimi, one minute remaining.

216
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,846
Good.

217
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,356
She has stopped playing by the book.

218
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:53,901
Is that bad?

219
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,569
No.

220
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,696
This is getting interesting!

221
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,658
A straight-up fist fight. It's her thing.

222
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:37,527
YUNA HAYAMI VS. ASUKA KUNIMI

223
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,864
Tatsuya, have you seen your dad?

224
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,908
No, I haven't.

225
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,493
Why?

226
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,246
He missed the board meeting today.

227
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,177
Hey, is that the chairman?

228
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,263
- Oh, wow.
- You're right, it is.

229
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,847
- Why is he here?
- Did you know?

230
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,516
No, I didn't.

231
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,518
No one told me anything.

232
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,938
- What's the matter?
- Why did he come?

233
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,899
He never shows up at games like this…

234
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:21,154
I found where Dad is.

235
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,156
What? Where?

236
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,700
Look…

237
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,871
SHOICHI YUUKI SHOWED UP.
MR. YUUKI IS AT THE ROOKIE CUP.

238
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,945
Looks like Asuka's having fun.

239
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:31,600
ROOK

240
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,106
I resign.

241
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,500
Oh! Uh, thank you very much.

242
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,025
That was amazing!

243
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,667
You're leaving without meeting her?

244
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,211
Hey, wait!

245
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,342
I remember you. Todou.

246
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,637
Hey! Stop it!

247
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,472
Thanks for remembering me.

248
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,183
I'm honored.

249
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:41,646
I see you still care about
the daughter you threw out.

250
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,731
Yuuki Ho-oh?

251
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,902
Todou, did you train Asuka?

252
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:48,486
Yes.

253
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,906
That somehow happened.

254
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,366
I see.

255
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:55,744
That's good.

256
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,038
What?

257
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,873
What's good?

258
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,752
You're the one
who said shogi isn't for me!

259
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,879
Are you pitying us losers for teaming up?

260
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,673
Hey, it's Chairman Yuuki!

261
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,342
- This way!
- Over there!

262
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:11,760
- Chairman!
- Hey.

263
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,386
We're not done yet!

264
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,180
That was a good game.

265
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,602
Hey Yuuki. Be prepared.

266
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:25,482
- The times are changing.
- Sir, a few words on the finals please.

267
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,026
- What brought you here today?
- Sir!

268
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,571
Welcome home.

269
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,295
<i>Today,</i>

270
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,131
<i>I, Tatsuya Yuuki, and Yuna Hayami,</i>

271
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:35,135
<i>are here to share</i>
<i>the news of our engagement.</i>

272
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:42,934
We are very pleased to be able to share
the news with you in our own words today.

273
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,478
Once we are officially married,

274
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,939
I will be retiring
from being a <i>joryu kishi</i>.

275
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:53,320
From now on, I will dedicate myself
to supporting my family.

276
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:02,120
Maybe she was looking
for a reason to quit.

277
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:09,210
<i>Though I'm stepping back,</i>
<i>I'll be supporting Tatsuya as his partner.</i>

278
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:14,090
<i>In that way,</i>
<i>I hope to give back to the shogi world.</i>

279
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,634
What's up? Feeling lonely?

280
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,678
No, it's not like that.

281
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:23,224
The more you win,
the more people you'll eliminate.

282
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,185
That's what shogi is.

283
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,613
Hello?

284
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:41,576
What? Are you kidding?
I need an explanation--

285
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,330
They hung up, damn it!

286
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,873
What's the matter?

287
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,249
We're banned.

288
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,461
You've been rejected
from every match we entered you into.

289
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:52,754
This is the fifth one.

290
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,172
Why?

291
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,132
Someone's pressuring them.

292
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:00,095
Someone's telling them to
keep you out of the game.

293
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,806
Pressure…

294
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,730
Thank you so much.

295
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,565
Please look straight ahead.

296
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,825
This way please.

297
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,509
Why're you interfering when
the very first female <i>kishi </i>is emerging?

298
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,636
I'm just playing the best move.

299
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,014
<i>The disciple you once failed</i>
<i>to make a </i>kishi <i>is interfering.</i>

300
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,266
<i>Kaori Yuuki.</i>

301
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,268
<i>Wouldn't you like to see</i>
<i>the very first female </i>kishi<i>?</i>

302
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:51,896
Why do you want to become a <i>kishi</i>?

303
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,232
<i>To fight against this shitty world.</i>

304
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,401
<i>Age? Gender?</i>

305
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,861
<i>None of that matters, does it?</i>

306
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:01,322
I'll use everyone as a stepping stone
and rise above.

307
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,282
