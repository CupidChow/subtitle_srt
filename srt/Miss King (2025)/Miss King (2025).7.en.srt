1
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,760
You're Seigo Todou, right?

2
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:12,595
Yes?

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,475
So, could I ask some questions
about Asuka Kunimi?

4
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:23,898
Do you recognize
the person in this picture?

5
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:32,240
This is Asuka Kunimi. Am I correct?

6
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:38,872
She's your disciple and the daughter who
Shoichi Yuuki had abandoned.

7
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,040
No…

8
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,125
I'm not sure what you mean.

9
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:47,213
But you were there too.

10
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,096
Asuka Kunimi resented Shoichi Yuuki.

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,932
She was there to take revenge.

12
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,602
Is that correct, Mr. Todou?

13
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,608
You were expelled from the world of shogi
for assaulting Shoichi.

14
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,861
I'm curious
how you were involved with her.

15
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,280
Would you mind sharing?

16
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,911
You're wrong.

17
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,999
This is <i>my </i>revenge.

18
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,671
She's just a piece I'm playing.

19
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:41,851
If Asuka Kunimi becomes a <i>kishi</i>,
it would cause chaos.

20
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:46,105
The first female <i>kishi</i> turned out to be
an attempted murderer?

21
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,482
ATTEMPTED MURDER?

22
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,487
Is everything written
in this article true?

23
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,573
SCOOP! SECRET CHILD

24
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,955
Asuka Kunimi is…

25
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,333
indeed my daughter.

26
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,293
- So it was true.
- A secret child.

27
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,380
However, she is not a secret child<i>.</i>
Nothing illegitimate.

28
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:15,009
She's legally registered
as part of the Kunimi family.

29
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,721
Why have you kept this hidden until now?

30
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,515
Well…

31
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,769
It was my decision.

32
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,855
This is your family's scandal.

33
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,481
Keep it out of the association.

34
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:32,235
It's the biggest scandal ever
in the history of shogi.

35
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,242
It's blowing up.

36
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,660
REAL-LIFE REVENGE DRAMA?

37
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,621
A DROPOUT GOING ROGUE

38
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,499
THE TERRORIST OF THE SHOGI WORLD

39
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,960
Apparently you're a terrorist.

40
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,297
I came up with this on the spot.
Not a bad plot, huh?

41
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,465
How can you joke around like that?

42
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,842
If we let them believe that

43
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,344
I was the mastermind
and you were just manipulated,

44
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,055
they probably won't cancel
your admission test.

45
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,142
From now on,
you and I are complete strangers.

46
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,318
Listen, this is your chance.

47
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:19,032
You may become the first female <i>kishi</i>.
All eyes are already on you.

48
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,659
What if you totally dominate the test?

49
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,120
You'll make headlines.

50
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,462
The more attention you draw,

51
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,964
the shogi world
won't be able to ignore you.

52
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,221
Win all the games.

53
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,225
That's the fastest way
to get to Shoichi Yuuki.

54
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,604
I know.

55
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,440
You don't have to tell me.

56

63

How's Asuka doing?

64
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,755
Keep steady.

65
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,967
Take it slow at first.

66
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,178
Sorry, we're not open yet--

67
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,348
- Hello! Whoa. He's really here.
- Coming in!

68
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,725
- What?
- I see.

69
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,144
Got us a terrorist!

70
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,146
Shall we detain him?

71
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,188
- Who are you?
- Nice.

72
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,906
Hey, who the heck are you?

73
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,575
You're a bad guy, right?

74
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:30,246
You're gonna get taken down and exposed.
This will go viral!

75
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,674
We've got a bounty on your head
that's all ours!

76
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,551
- Hey, where are you going?
- Whoa, hey!

77
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,469
Whoa!

78
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,929
- Hey!
- Stop it!

79
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,097
What the heck--

80
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,974
- He's dangerous!
- Watch out!

81
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,100
Get over here!

82
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,104
- Get down!
- Get off me!

83
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,404

84
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,574
- Hey!
- Are you kidding?

85
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,575
Seigo!

86
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,202

87
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,829
- Stop filming!
- Come on!

88
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:25,968
I resign.

89
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,769
<i>Great game, Ms. Kunimi.</i>

90
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,021
That was amazing. By the way…

91
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,274
What advice did you get
from your teacher, Todou 7-dan?

92
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,114
I don't have a mentor with such a name.

93
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,074
Oh, but…

94
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,744
Good game.

95
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,829
Great game.

96
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,091
What happened?

97
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,573
Ms. Reiko? Ms. Reiko!

98
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,996
Ms. Reiko!

99
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,081
Ms. Reiko!

100
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,777
Ms. Reiko!

101
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,238
Asuka.

102
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,615
Are you okay?

103
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,657
All this…

104
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,910
What happened here?

105
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,997
Seigo was attacked.

106
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,540
What?

107
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:23,669
Some idiots stormed in, fired up by
the article and the online hype.

108
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,962
No…

109
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,299
Is Mr. Todou all right?
What about the police?

110
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,926
He's fine.

111
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,930
We didn't call the police.

112
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,431
Why not?

113
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,893
He said that if this blows up,
they might cancel your test.

114
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,605
But they did all this--

115
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,525
We're fine. No one got hurt either.

116
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,443
Well…

117
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,489
I'll have to close up for a while though.

118
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,830
Seigo won't be back for some time either.

119
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,459
It's not safe for him.

120
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,044
Where is he now?

121
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,551
I can't tell you.

122
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,931
He said, "Forget about me.
Just focus on the test."

123
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,727
He doesn't want to be seen with you.

124
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:26,566
He's scared he might cause more trouble
and ruin everything for you.

125
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,195
What an idiot.

126
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:44,792
THE ADMISSION TEST IS STILL HAPPENING?

127
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:49,130
A TERRORIST WHO'S A <i>KISHI?</i> WHAT A JOKE!

128
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:54,510
Social media is still blowing up.

129
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,262
Shouldn't we cancel the admission test?

130
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,930
That would only add fuel to the fire.

131
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,933
What if an insider leaked the information?

132
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,186
Who would do that in the first place?

133
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:17,533
I'm impressed they made up a whole story
from screenshots of the CCTV footage.

134
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,661
Why did you leak it?

135
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,790
Because it's more fun that way.

136
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,842
A nice change, isn't it?

137
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,971
To shake things up a bit
in this quiet shogi world.

138
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,892
And Asuka Kunimi, she's finished.

139
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,520
The birth of the first female <i>kishi</i>
isn't going to happen.

140
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,606
End of story.

141
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:50,900
You can thank me.

142
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,860
This isn't the end of the story.

144
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,240
You knew it would, didn't you?

145
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,659
So why did you do that?

146
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,007
Why do you think I did it?

147
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,894
Dad, why do you think I did it?

148
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,279
You never get it, huh?

149
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,366

00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,749
When I play shogi,
everyone ends up miserable.

181
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,919
Hey, cut that crap.

182
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,504
<i>Your reason to live is right before you.</i>

183
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,214
Play shogi.

184
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:06,882
Asuka Kunimi.

185
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,094
Forget what your mom wanted.
It's your life.

186
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,054
She is my…

187
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,974
<i>What are you?</i>

188
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,894
Try making me any more miserable.

189
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,206
Asuka.

190
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,585
Asuka.

191
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:49,341
You once said, "When I play shogi,
everyone ends up miserable."

192
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,352
I don't think that's true.

193
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,355
I'm sure Seigo would agree with me.

194
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,827
I need to clean up soon.

195
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,579
Can you bring him back?

196
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,206
He won't listen to me.

197
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:35,220
Whatever's eating at you, throw it at him.

198
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,515
Good night.

199
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:13,717
SAWADA MANUFACTURING

200
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,280
What are you doing here?

201
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,990
The tabloids might spot you here

202
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,659
and make another scandal.

203
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,843
Here.

204
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,679
Thank you.

205
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,609
Hey, you look a little different.

206
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,069
What?

207
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,573
What happened to your face
since I last saw you?

208
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,491
Plastic surgery?

209
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,701
No!

210
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,579
Right, you're busy losing games.

211
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,038
No time, huh?

212
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,676
Apparently,
people call me a terrorist now.

213
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,721
Social media is a total hellscape.

214
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:46,268
You'll also be targeted
if you're seen with me.

215
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,312
So drink your tea and go.

216
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,249
Mr. Todou, you once told me…

217
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,043
What?

218
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:15,505
"Try making me any more miserable."

219
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:19,801
Try making me any more miserable.

220
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,472
How about now?

221
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,766
Are you miserable?

222
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,562
The whole country hates you.

223
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,940
They call you evil.

224
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,902
They attack you and harm you.

225
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,949
Are you miserable?

226
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,290
Yes, I am miserable.

227
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,585
It sucks. It's your fault.

228
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,879
Not just me. Reiko too.

229
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,339
They destroyed her place.

230
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,967
I know! It's awful.

231
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,260
Total hell.

232
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,933
But…

233
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,645
It will get better.

234
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,607
Ms. Reiko's store and your injury.

235
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,317
It will be fixed.

236
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,153
I will fix it.

237
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,613
What are you--

238
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:25,075
I will play shogi and fix you both.

239
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,911
So…

240
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,999
come fight with me.

241
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,170
Stop hiding.

242
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,464
Stop running.

243
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,262
You are my teacher.

244
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:53,979
Come with me all the way
to the end of this hell!

245
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,243
If you two are not miserable,
I'll be fine too.

246
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,169
What are you talking about?

247
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,754
You're insane!

248
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,093
Can you do this?

249
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,345
I can.

250
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,266
You get depressed.

251
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,726
You get pumped up.

252
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,021
All on your own. Selfish brat.

253
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:47,407
The next opponent
is a rookie who just ranked 4-dan.

254
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,658
We'll take him down.

255
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,911
How's your injury?

256
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,455
Fully healed.

257
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,881
Ouch, it hurts!

258
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,466
Oh, it's not healed after all.

259
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,135
It has.

260
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:08,845
Let's go.

261
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,162
Welcome home.

262
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,416
I'm home.

263
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,298
Okay, you two.

264
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,425
- Let's start cleaning.
- Okay.

265
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,846
Seigo, put these back up.

266
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,764
- These?
- Yes.

267
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,850
- You can do it!
- Okay.

268
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,310
Heave-ho!

269
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,855
Give it your all!

270
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,315
My left arm still hurts.

271
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,526
Didn't you say you've healed?

272
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,485
Has he?

273
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:06,820
I have!

274
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,114
Great! Go on then.

275
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,950
Ouch, it really hurts!

276
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,607
You like it?

277
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:58,038
<i>KISHI</i> ADMISSION TEST, BEST OF FIVE
FOURTH GAME

278
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,506
It is now the scheduled time.

279
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,299
Please begin.

280
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,469
Let's have a good game.

281
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,734
<i>The fourth game of the</i>

282
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,007
I resign.

283
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,804
<i>What an impressive game!</i>

284
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,640
<i>Tsuyuki 4-dan was completely at a loss.</i>

285
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,351
<i>Asuka Kunimi, amateur, dominates.</i>

286
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,731
<i>She's completely different</i>
<i>from the last game.</i>

287
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,650
<i>- Her reading of the board was exceptional.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

288
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,570
Wow, amazing!

289
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,448
She did it! Asuka!

290
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,464
- UGH, SHE WON.
- A CRIMINAL BECOMING A <i>KISHI?</i>

291
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,799
- SHE DOESN'T DESERVE TO BE A PRO.
- SHE'S NOT A CRIMINAL!

292
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,010
- FIRST FEMALE <i>KISHI</i> IS BORN!
- STOP HER!

293
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,054
BOO-HOO. IT'S OVER FOR THE SHOGI WORLD.

294
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,890
TAKE AWAY HER RIGHT TO CHALLENGE
BEFORE SHE REALLY KILLS SOMEONE.

295
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,725
DON'T TAINT THE HISTORY OF SHOGI.

296
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:30,648
We sincerely apologize
for the public disturbance caused.

297
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:37,238
Many have reached out to question us about
Asuka Kunimi's <i>kishi</i> admission test,

298
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,075
and whether she should be eligible.

299
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:45,747
Today, Chairman Shoichi Yuuki

300
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,750
will address this matter.

301
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,878
Yes.

302
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,048
As reported,

303
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,176
Asuka Kunimi is…

304
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,682
my daughter.

305
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:12,982
Some media mentioned
there was an attempted murder.

306
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:18,363
That part is completely false.

307
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,116
Are you covering for your daughter?

308
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,077
Also…

309
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:29,707
the person who leaked this information…

310
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,005
is my son…

311
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,426
Tatsuya Yuuki.

312
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,052
What does that mean?

313
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:49,394
I sincerely apologize for all
the trouble my children have caused.

314
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,821
I promise…

315
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,742
I will take full responsibility

316
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,411
and end this scandal.

317
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,956
For Tatsuya…

318
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:15,378
he will be suspended
from playing shogi indefinitely.

319
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,965
As for Asuka Kunimi…

320
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,762
we will continue her <i>kishi</i> admission test.

321
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:29,768
However, I will be personally serving…

322
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,064
as the examiner for the final match.

323
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,611
Furthermore…

324
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,364
after that game…

325
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,367
I will…

326
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,832
retire from shogi.

This is getting insane.

330
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:01,466
Does this mean he'll be her next opponent?

331
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:05,094
Couldn't ask for a better setup. Right?

332
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,079
