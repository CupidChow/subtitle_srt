1
00:00:35,313 --> 00:00:38,441
I wasn't even eighteen
yet when I came here

2
00:00:38,868 --> 00:00:42,289
with Kuya and his friends.

3
00:00:42,862 --> 00:00:47,784
I just went with Kuya
because Mama didn't want him

4
00:00:47,826 --> 00:00:49,703
to take a vacation without
me accompanying him.

5
00:00:49,837 --> 00:00:54,757
Little did I know that in our
short stay here in Sto. Tomas,

6
00:00:54,849 --> 00:00:57,769
I would be able to
experience a lot of things that

7
00:00:57,794 --> 00:01:00,839
would be very,
very hard to forget.

8
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:01,840
Martin!

9
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:03,800
Yes?

10
00:01:03,825 --> 00:01:04,828
You left this.

11
00:01:04,883 --> 00:01:06,885
It's been ringing for a while now.
Might be your mom.

12
00:01:17,564 --> 00:01:18,606
Hello, Ma?

13
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:21,683
What did Mama want this time?

14
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,545
Nothing. Just checking up.

15
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,003
"Checking up"? Why does
she need to check us up?

16
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:29,610
You snitched on me, didn't you?

17
00:01:29,694 --> 00:01:30,844
What?

18
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:33,371
I told her nothing!
There's nothing to tell her.

19
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:36,316
Hell, I don't know! You
like sucking up to her, right?

20
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:40,432
I didn't tell her anything. She just
called and asked us how we were.

21
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:43,982
Look, this is why your
little brother is here.

22
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:46,526
So that your mom could
monitor you while you party.

23
00:01:46,551 --> 00:01:47,527
Am I right?

24
00:01:47,552 --> 00:01:49,512
Can you believe this guy?
Hey! I'm still talking to you.

25
00:01:49,846 --> 00:01:51,347
This asshole... Hey!

26
00:01:54,534 --> 00:01:55,577
Guess what? They're on the way.

27
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:57,527
- Let me see.
- They're arriving this afternoon.

28
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:00,111
- That's what I'm fucking talking about.
- It's so on, bro. Party!

29
00:02:00,191 --> 00:02:01,466
Don't forget my girl, okay?

30
00:02:01,508 --> 00:02:02,731
- I know!
- That's what you promised...

31
00:02:03,314 --> 00:02:04,315
Mister?

32
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,117
Mister?

33
00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:07,184
Yes, sir?

34
00:02:07,746 --> 00:02:09,510
We're heading off
to town for a while.

35
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:10,842
Are you going to
have dinner here?

36
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:11,493
Sure.

37
00:02:11,493 --> 00:02:12,452
We're only fetching some people.

38
00:02:12,477 --> 00:02:14,353
- Okay.
- Right, Mister!

39
00:02:14,454 --> 00:02:16,498
Can you cook for six people?

40
00:02:16,998 --> 00:02:17,957
Six?

41
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:18,958
Why six?

42
00:02:19,334 --> 00:02:20,293
We have...

43
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:21,336
Guests.

44
00:02:21,377 --> 00:02:22,780
Guests? Who?

45
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:26,032
Why do you have so many questions?
Are you the owner of this place?

46
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:27,342
Let it go, let it go.

47
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,968
Mart, you wanna come with?

48
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:30,136
No, no.

49
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:32,663
Stay here. Understand?
Wait for Mom's phone call.

50
00:02:32,764 --> 00:02:35,850
And tell her I went out
with Paolo, okay? Fucking idiot.

51
00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:39,187
Let's go before this gets worse.

52
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,128
Did she text?

53
00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:01,769
A while ago.

54
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:04,163
Told me they were almost here.

55
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:05,658
Where are they, anyways?

56
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:08,300
Down in Manabat.

57
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,827
But that was a while ago.

58
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:11,726
That place is just
twenty minutes away.

59
00:04:12,396 --> 00:04:14,773
Who are they with?
Maybe they got lost?

60
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:17,619
They hitched a ride from
her cousin, apparently.

61
00:04:18,177 --> 00:04:19,137
I'll text her.

62
00:04:19,162 --> 00:04:20,163
- Sure.
- Wait.

63
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:21,486
What's taking them so long?

64
00:04:22,557 --> 00:04:24,392
- I know, bro. Fuck.
- Right.

65
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:26,519
Yeah, Hannah's okay
but I like Geleen better.

66
00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:27,503
Who's more fuckable?

67
00:04:27,503 --> 00:04:28,504
Geleen, of course.

68
00:04:28,504 --> 00:04:31,023
I'm telling you, bro, if I
waste my time with her...

69
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:32,508
- Who's that?
- It's them, I think.

70
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:33,577
That's them.

71
00:04:34,135 --> 00:04:34,636
Go, go, go.

72
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:36,820
- Come.
- Give me someone good, okay?

73
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:40,600
Hi!

74
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:42,644
Thank you, Elmer!

75
00:04:42,644 --> 00:04:43,561
You guys settled?

76
00:04:43,603 --> 00:04:44,520
We're good.

77
00:04:44,545 --> 00:04:47,381
Pao, this is Elmer. My cousin.

78
00:04:56,491 --> 00:04:57,408
Hold this, bro.

79
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,409
Sure.

80
00:05:00,286 --> 00:05:01,204
Where are the others?

81
00:05:01,287 --> 00:05:02,246
They're not here.

82
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:05,781
- It's just you?
- Isn't it obvious?

83
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,182
Where's Hannah?

84
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:10,296
She's not here!

85
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,593
What do you mean "not here"?

86
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:18,846
Hannah had a problem because

87
00:05:18,846 --> 00:05:21,391
her boyfriend found out that
she's coming here with me.

88
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:23,976
Boyfriend? Hannah
has a boyfriend?

89
00:05:23,976 --> 00:05:24,977
It's her life.

90
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:26,729
What about Geleen?

91
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:29,524
She didn't want to
go without Hannah.

92
00:05:30,775 --> 00:05:32,735
This is such bullshit.

93
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,861
Why is it just you?

94
00:05:34,045 --> 00:05:36,089
After making me come here in
the middle of nowhere,

95
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:37,824
you still have the balls
to talk to me like that?

96
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,367
What do you mean "just you"?

97
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:40,660
It's as if,

98
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,703
- you're...
- Okay, okay! Jesus.

99
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,621
You should be thankful

100
00:05:43,646 --> 00:05:46,085
that I even came here
without Hannah and Geleen.

101
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,417
Alright already!

102
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,460
Thank you. If that
still means anything.

103
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:54,590
It's just that you made all these promises.
You told me Geleen and Hannah are coming.

104
00:05:56,843 --> 00:05:58,302
You're so full of shit, Nads.

105
00:05:58,327 --> 00:05:59,287
Fuck you, Paolo.

106
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:01,534
Stop the car. I'm
going back to Manila.

107
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:02,560
Alright, alright!

108
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:04,640
You think I'm kidding? Huh?

109
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,783
Alright already. Jesus.
You have problems.

110
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:07,627
Fuck you!

111
00:06:07,652 --> 00:06:09,239
Fuck you too, asshole.

112
00:06:52,774 --> 00:06:53,733
Manong Dado...

113
00:06:53,983 --> 00:06:54,400
Yes, Martin?

114
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,693
I have a question.

115
00:06:55,693 --> 00:06:56,569
What is it?

116
00:06:56,986 --> 00:06:59,071
Do you know who
lives in that house?

117
00:06:59,138 --> 00:07:00,448
Out on the left?

118
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:01,456
Which one?

119
00:07:01,846 --> 00:07:03,765
The first one on the left.

120
00:07:04,076 --> 00:07:06,554
That's Congressman Cerrudo's property.

121
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:07,555
Congressman?

122
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,540
Yeah. They're rich, you know.

123
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:11,981
Bigtime. Very
old political family.

124
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:13,964
You know what? They're the
only people running things here.

125
00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:17,114
Their faces are the only things
that change. It's insufferable.

126
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:18,368
Does somebody live there?

127
00:07:18,393 --> 00:07:20,103
No. That's a resthouse.

128
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:23,395
There was a caretaker once. I don't
know what happened to that asshole.

129
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,491
Then who was that
woman I saw at the beach?

130
00:07:26,575 --> 00:07:28,493
She was wading directly
in front of the house.

131
00:07:28,518 --> 00:07:29,583
A woman?

132
00:07:31,272 --> 00:07:32,357
A guest, most likely.

133
00:07:35,244 --> 00:07:36,203
Well!

134
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:38,567
Our Masters are here.

135
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:40,965
I'll come greet them.

136
00:07:41,489 --> 00:07:42,448
What is this?

137
00:07:46,577 --> 00:07:47,942
This is...

138
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:50,998
Mang Dado. The caretaker
of this resthouse.

139
00:07:51,082 --> 00:07:53,161
Mang Dado. Nadine.

140
00:07:53,388 --> 00:07:55,403
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

141
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,897
There. Mang Dado, take
extra care of this one, alright?

142
00:07:58,922 --> 00:08:00,466
Because she might say
bad things on the internet,

143
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:02,591
- if she doesn't enjoy her stay here.
- Hey, I'm not like that.

144
00:08:03,427 --> 00:08:05,388
And do you know Chino's
little brother already?

145
00:08:05,471 --> 00:08:06,347
Hi!

146
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:08,231
That's my little brother, Martin.

147
00:08:08,403 --> 00:08:09,657
Hey, Martin!

148
00:08:09,682 --> 00:08:10,599
We're introducing you.

149
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:11,625
Hi, Martin.

150
00:08:12,436 --> 00:08:14,005
Martin's circumcised already.

151
00:08:14,046 --> 00:08:15,370
Right? Show us, Mart.

152
00:08:15,982 --> 00:08:17,191
Wasn't that just last year?

153
00:08:17,441 --> 00:08:18,668
- Come on, whip it out!
- Let us see for a bit.

154
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:19,360
Don't be shy.

155
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,152
- Fuck you.
- Hurry up.

156
00:08:20,152 --> 00:08:21,404
- What?
- Why's he like that?

157
00:08:21,445 --> 00:08:22,530
- Asshole! Right?
- He said "fuck you".

158
00:08:22,572 --> 00:08:23,489
I'll be going.

159
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:25,007
Is he okay?

160
00:08:25,032 --> 00:08:26,075
But really, he's
already circumcised.

161
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:27,326
- Yeah, he's cut.
- He's cut.

162
00:08:27,326 --> 00:08:28,119
I mean, the dude's tall.

163
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:28,619
Are you sure?

164
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:29,078
Of course.

165
00:08:29,662 --> 00:08:32,415
Why don't you try calling Hannah?
Make them follow.

166
00:08:32,498 --> 00:08:34,723
Don't you understand?
They can't come.

167
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:36,794
Do you want to have a confrontation
with Hannah's boyfriend?

168
00:08:37,174 --> 00:08:40,221
Then why did you invite Hannah
when she already has a boyfriend?

169
00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:42,744
Don't you remember
that she likes Chino?

170
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:44,385
There you go!

171
00:08:44,427 --> 00:08:47,388
Shit. So, I'm the reason their
relationship was almost ruined now?

172
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:48,566
You're overreacting.

173
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:50,956
You're just a crush. She
doesn't want to be with you.

174
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:52,624
And, also, as far as I can tell.

175
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:55,401
Her boyfriend's rich. Chinese.

176
00:08:55,426 --> 00:08:57,329
Owns a property in Binondo.

177
00:08:57,728 --> 00:09:00,166
Is that so? So, in other words...

178
00:09:00,283 --> 00:09:02,169
She just wants to
have a taste of this.

179
00:09:02,194 --> 00:09:04,130
Why not? Don't you like her too?

180
00:09:04,155 --> 00:09:06,465
Admit it. You already told us.

181
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,686
Hey, hey! Where are you going?

182
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:09,004
I'm getting more beer.

183
00:09:09,193 --> 00:09:10,657
I'll take a look if some
of those are cold already.

184
00:09:10,822 --> 00:09:12,157
- Okay?
- Alright, fine.

185
00:09:15,082 --> 00:09:17,135
Don't you feel sorry
for my bestfriend?

186
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,258
He thought he was getting
some action here at the beach,

187
00:09:19,283 --> 00:09:20,158
but...

188
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:22,960
You didn't even
bring anyone for him.

189
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:25,301
Sorry, okay? I wasn't informed that

190
00:09:25,326 --> 00:09:28,537
my job is to look for a hole
for your bestfriend to fuck.

191
00:09:29,472 --> 00:09:31,390
Alright, alright. Try Geleen.

192
00:09:31,474 --> 00:09:32,516
Tell her to come.

193
00:09:32,558 --> 00:09:35,267
I already told you that she's
not coming without Hannah.

194
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:39,106
Forget it. I'll take care of it.

195
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:41,235
You'll take care of it?

196
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:43,711
What in the hell do you mean?
You're going to let Chino fuck you?

197
00:09:43,736 --> 00:09:46,030
Fuck already? Can't we
start at a blowjob for starters?

198
00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:49,232
Damn, and you're saying
that to my face, huh?

199
00:09:49,357 --> 00:09:53,471
Sure! It was you who was acting like,
"Oh, my poor bestfriend."

200
00:09:53,496 --> 00:09:55,331
Well, here you go.
the solution. Happy?

201
00:09:56,203 --> 00:09:57,913
They were fucking right.

202
00:09:58,142 --> 00:09:59,393
You really are a slut.

203
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:02,463
Yeah, I'm a slut.
That's old news.

204
00:10:11,138 --> 00:10:13,224
So, we're not the only
people here at the beach.

205
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:14,291
Ma'am?

206
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:16,202
What are you doing here?

207
00:10:16,227 --> 00:10:17,603
Why didn't you text me?

208
00:10:17,828 --> 00:10:18,704
Ask Sir.

209
00:10:18,729 --> 00:10:21,357
We came from a meeting. He
told me to drive straight here.

210
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:23,820
Are you going to eat here?

211
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:25,294
I didn't prepare anything.

212
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:28,823
That's okay. Sir told me we're
buying food at the resort next door.

213
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:43,963
Paolo, what the hell?

214
00:10:44,981 --> 00:10:47,191
Stop the act. Come on,
you know you want to.

215
00:10:47,216 --> 00:10:48,384
Are you crazy?

216
00:10:49,557 --> 00:10:50,678
What?

217
00:10:52,388 --> 00:10:53,889
I thought you said
you were a slut?

218
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,725
I know. But...

219
00:10:56,142 --> 00:10:57,642
Chino might come back.

220
00:10:57,935 --> 00:10:59,937
Wow. Now, you're being
demure when it comes to Chino.

221
00:10:59,962 --> 00:11:01,756
Just a little while ago you
wanted to suck the dude's cock.

222
00:11:02,815 --> 00:11:03,482
Fuck.

223
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:08,029
So? Does it feel good?

224
00:11:09,113 --> 00:11:10,072
Fuck you.

225
00:11:10,114 --> 00:11:12,366
Don't start something
you can't finish.

226
00:11:12,616 --> 00:11:13,326
Don't you want it?

227
00:11:13,617 --> 00:11:14,869
- Go fucking faster!
- Don't you want it?

228
00:11:26,714 --> 00:11:27,757
Let's eat!

229
00:11:27,798 --> 00:11:30,676
Come and eat while
the sinigang is hot.

230
00:11:30,718 --> 00:11:33,721
It's made with fresh bangus
that's why this is extra delicious.

231
00:11:33,746 --> 00:11:34,789
Martin!

232
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:36,226
- Come.
- What?

233
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:37,812
Call Pao and Nadine.

234
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:39,243
Where are they at?

235
00:11:39,268 --> 00:11:40,619
That's why you should
go and look for them.

236
00:11:40,644 --> 00:11:42,980
Will I ask you if I know?
Tell them it's time to eat.

237
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:45,274
- Go. Go.
- Manong, have you seen where they went?

238
00:11:45,357 --> 00:11:46,609
I haven't seen them in the house

239
00:11:46,634 --> 00:11:48,427
so they're most likely outside.

240
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:50,820
Come on and get them.
Tell them it's time to eat.

241
00:11:51,947 --> 00:11:53,390
Manong, this looks delicious.

242
00:12:00,372 --> 00:12:01,415
Paolo?

243
00:12:03,793 --> 00:12:05,669
They're calling for you.
It's time to eat.

244
00:12:08,798 --> 00:12:09,840
Paolo? Nadine?

245
00:12:11,571 --> 00:12:12,651
Fuck.

246
00:12:12,676 --> 00:12:13,944
They're calling for you!

247
00:12:13,969 --> 00:12:14,528
Wait, wait. Shut up.

248
00:12:14,553 --> 00:12:15,805
- It's time for dinner!
- What the hell!

249
00:12:15,805 --> 00:12:17,848
Shut up. Martin might hear you.

250
00:12:17,848 --> 00:12:18,616
What's the matter?

251
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:19,600
Don't stop.

252
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:20,451
Go faster!

253
00:12:20,476 --> 00:12:21,811
Fuck! Alright, come on.

254
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:30,611
- Fuck!
- Huh?

255
00:12:30,636 --> 00:12:31,921
What the hell?

256
00:12:31,946 --> 00:12:33,906
Are you a virgin?
Go faster!

257
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,718
Shit!

258
00:12:40,388 --> 00:12:41,429
Fuck!

259
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:52,120
So, how was your day?

260
00:12:52,145 --> 00:12:55,261
Boring. What will I
do here all by myself?

261
00:12:55,928 --> 00:12:58,139
I went out for a bit.
Took a swim.

262
00:12:59,598 --> 00:13:01,132
You swam all by yourself?

263
00:13:01,183 --> 00:13:02,143
Yup.

264
00:13:02,993 --> 00:13:04,954
Don't go too far.
That's dangerous.

265
00:13:04,979 --> 00:13:07,940
At only six years old, I
already knew how to swim.

266
00:13:09,882 --> 00:13:11,944
Okay. Let's eat.

267
00:13:11,969 --> 00:13:13,804
I bought you your favorite.

268
00:13:14,276 --> 00:13:17,250
It's delicious. Fresh
from Mrs. Garbanzos.

269
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:18,884
Simon!

270
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:20,484
- Sir?
- Come and get your food.

271
00:13:20,617 --> 00:13:22,257
I'm alright, Sir.
You guys go ahead.

272
00:13:54,945 --> 00:13:55,821
He told you that?

273
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:56,847
I said yes already!

274
00:13:56,872 --> 00:13:58,373
Where have you guys been?

275
00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:01,070
I sent Martin to look for you,
but he didn't see you guys.

276
00:14:01,577 --> 00:14:02,369
Around.

277
00:14:02,598 --> 00:14:03,663
- Come, eat.
- Yeah.

278
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:05,569
We'll just take a bath, Manong.

279
00:14:05,764 --> 00:14:08,142
Hey! What the hell did
you guys do? Admit it.

280
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:09,460
We ate each other.

281
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:14,921
Are you done, Sir?

282
00:14:15,148 --> 00:14:16,570
Yes. Take it away.

283
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,116
So you can eat.

284
00:14:18,265 --> 00:14:19,460
How are you, Simon?

285
00:14:19,664 --> 00:14:20,774
I'm okay, Sir.

286
00:14:23,641 --> 00:14:25,343
Will you sleep here?

287
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:28,187
I don't know. What time is it?

288
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:32,929
I hope you can stay
here for a couple of days.

289
00:14:33,978 --> 00:14:35,694
I could, hopefully.

290
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:39,140
You used to stay here for
days with no one looking for you.

291
00:14:39,502 --> 00:14:40,866
We were in Manila then.

292
00:14:41,374 --> 00:14:42,968
Right now, we're
in the province.

293
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:45,058
People know my family here.

294
00:14:45,153 --> 00:14:46,773
If they see me hanging around.

295
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:49,421
The news will spread.
Everyone will know.

296
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:51,304
That's going to be
the death of my family.

297
00:14:57,132 --> 00:15:01,937
You know what? My back hurts
from sitting in the office all day.

298
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:03,577
Come.

299
00:15:06,283 --> 00:15:07,398
Give me a massage.

300
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:20,990
I'm so exhausted.

301
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:26,370
Daddy worked me for eight hours.

302
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,941
Nonstop meetings.

303
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:29,926
My lower back is killing me.

304
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,482
Come here.

305
00:15:40,658 --> 00:15:43,554
What's the matter?
Take off your clothes.

306
00:15:56,317 --> 00:15:58,110
Go and get the alcohol.

307
00:15:58,135 --> 00:15:59,136
Go.

308
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:15,044
Wait, wait, wait.

309
00:16:16,128 --> 00:16:19,131
Do you know what part of
your body is my favorite?

310
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:02,002
Robs.

311
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:04,589
Quiet.

312
00:19:05,517 --> 00:19:06,874
I'm resting.

313
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:08,717
You drained me.

314
00:19:19,728 --> 00:19:22,481
Answer it. It
might be important.

315
00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:25,192
Answer it.

316
00:19:29,404 --> 00:19:30,280
Wait.

317
00:19:31,823 --> 00:19:32,866
Hello? Hello, Kathy.

318
00:19:32,891 --> 00:19:34,176
Hey. How are you, baby?

319
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:35,202
Yes.

320
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:36,748
How's your brother?

321
00:19:36,781 --> 00:19:38,313
Yeah, I'll be home in a while.

322
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:41,531
Yes. Okay, let me
talk to your mother.

323
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:42,876
Okay.

324
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,047
Hello? Hello, Ginny.

325
00:19:48,257 --> 00:19:52,219
Did the documents that

326
00:19:53,178 --> 00:19:55,180
I need from Prospero
arrive already?

327
00:19:56,265 --> 00:19:57,307
Yup. Yes.

328
00:19:57,307 --> 00:20:00,352
We're just here in Las Cuccinas.

329
00:20:16,577 --> 00:20:18,537
Is there anywhere
we can buy soju?

330
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:19,522
I doubt.

331
00:20:20,581 --> 00:20:21,582
You never know.

332
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:23,393
I think there are in town.

333
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:26,355
There's a convenience
store there, as far as I know.

334
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:29,441
Go buy some. So we
can be more happy.

335
00:20:30,704 --> 00:20:32,050
Why? Aren't you
happy enough with this?

336
00:20:32,718 --> 00:20:34,636
It's still different with soju.

337
00:20:34,761 --> 00:20:36,888
Is that so? Wait up.

338
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,810
- You really never run out, do you?
- What the hell is that?

339
00:20:43,103 --> 00:20:44,104
- What is that?
- This is some good shit.

340
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:45,772
Here. Open your mouth.

341
00:20:46,106 --> 00:20:48,025
I don't want it! What is that?

342
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:49,693
- Didn't you want to be fucking happy?
- Open!

343
00:20:49,718 --> 00:20:51,553
That might be a horse aphrodisiac,
as far as I'm concerned.

344
00:20:51,737 --> 00:20:54,890
Look, even an elephant aphrodisiac
wouldn't work on you.

345
00:20:55,824 --> 00:20:57,034
- Now, open your mouth! Here.
- I'm doing it!

346
00:20:58,702 --> 00:20:59,620
Now, drink. Drink. Drink.

347
00:20:59,661 --> 00:21:01,580
- Drink, drink.
- This is too sketchy, you asshole.

348
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,082
Are you crazy? No. Look...

349
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:09,504
If you see a gay
Manananggal flying around

350
00:21:09,504 --> 00:21:10,547
you just ride with it.

351
00:21:10,547 --> 00:21:11,548
Fuck!

352
00:21:11,548 --> 00:21:12,841
What the hell did
you make me take?

353
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:13,759
It's nothing!

354
00:21:14,304 --> 00:21:15,177
Crazy ass.

355
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:17,763
I took some a while ago,
and I'm still safe.

356
00:21:20,515 --> 00:21:21,975
When are you coming back?

357
00:21:23,906 --> 00:21:25,983
If there's a chance,
I'll come back.

358
00:21:26,813 --> 00:21:28,976
But you're going to be
here on Friday, right?

359
00:21:32,152 --> 00:21:33,153
I promise.

360
00:21:33,178 --> 00:21:34,638
If I have time, I'll come back.

361
00:21:35,197 --> 00:21:36,740
Just promise me.

362
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:43,246
We're taking a vacation
in Japan, remember?

363
00:21:44,164 --> 00:21:45,123
I promise.

364
00:21:45,332 --> 00:21:46,767
It doesn't have to be Japan.

365
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:48,251
I'm fine here.

366
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:51,922
Alright, okay. I have to go.

367
00:21:52,139 --> 00:21:53,157
Okay.

368
00:21:54,174 --> 00:21:55,175
I have to go.

369
00:21:55,563 --> 00:21:56,564
Bye.

370
00:22:07,187 --> 00:22:08,188
Simon.

371
00:22:09,106 --> 00:22:10,107
If Manang asks,

372
00:22:10,107 --> 00:22:12,225
Tell her we went to
Mr. Arellano's house.

373
00:22:12,695 --> 00:22:14,254
- Copy, Sir.
- Don't forget.

374
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:16,538
- She reports to your Ma'am.
- Okay, Sir.

375
00:22:22,202 --> 00:22:24,483
Paolo, it's so nice here.

376
00:22:25,055 --> 00:22:26,561
Come sit with me.

377
00:22:26,765 --> 00:22:27,944
Are you crazy?

378
00:22:28,266 --> 00:22:29,893
It might give.

379
00:22:29,918 --> 00:22:31,507
Look at this woman.

380
00:22:31,532 --> 00:22:33,451
She's fucked up, isn't she?

381
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:35,634
You know...

382
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:38,215
Some people say it's better
to make babies in a hammock.

383
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,241
No way!

384
00:22:39,563 --> 00:22:43,279
I might go dizzy,
and then I'll fall.

385
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:45,597
Well, if he doesn't want to,
then you go, Chino.

386
00:22:45,622 --> 00:22:47,015
Come here and sit with me.

387
00:22:47,276 --> 00:22:49,452
And what the hell am I
supposed to do there by your side?

388
00:22:49,477 --> 00:22:52,021
Come here and you'll find out.

389
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,390
Goddamn. You can
say that to my face?

390
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,292
How brazen.

391
00:22:57,463 --> 00:22:58,505
Give me that.

392
00:22:59,176 --> 00:23:01,136
Chino, tell me the truth.

393
00:23:02,011 --> 00:23:03,522
Given the chance.

394
00:23:04,707 --> 00:23:05,965
Will you fuck me?

395
00:23:07,372 --> 00:23:10,892
Fucking shit. This
girl really is fucked up.

396
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:12,453
Hey, he's blushing!

397
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:14,396
Hey, I'm not blushing!

398
00:23:14,421 --> 00:23:15,689
This is just tipsy.

399
00:23:15,714 --> 00:23:18,004
Hey, where are you going?

400
00:23:18,091 --> 00:23:19,092
He can't hear you.

401
00:23:19,414 --> 00:23:20,849
Where are you going?

402
00:23:20,874 --> 00:23:22,590
Around. Trying to get some air.

403
00:23:23,013 --> 00:23:23,764
Get some air!

404
00:23:23,764 --> 00:23:25,179
Get some air.

405
00:23:26,057 --> 00:23:27,058
To the moon!

406
00:23:28,316 --> 00:23:29,610
- It's cold at the moon.
- Hey!

407
00:23:29,644 --> 00:23:30,699
You're fucked up, aren't you?

408
00:23:31,005 --> 00:23:31,968
Well, how about you?

409
00:23:32,105 --> 00:23:32,981
You look high as fuck.

410
00:23:33,006 --> 00:23:36,376
Just a bit. But this guy?
He's super fucked up.

411
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:37,736
- That's old news.
- What the hell was that?

412
00:24:32,457 --> 00:24:33,458
Hey, what gives?

413
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:35,410
- Stop the act, dude.
- Look at this asshole.

414
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,815
Stop being a pussy, Chino.

415
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,980
I mean, it's fucking obvious
that you're enjoying this.

416
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:41,007
Look, you have a raging hard-on!

417
00:25:05,022 --> 00:25:06,196
Yes?

418
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:51,620
Hi!

419
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:52,812
One more.

420
00:29:23,765 --> 00:29:25,600
Martin, you're here.

421
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:27,018
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

422
00:29:27,043 --> 00:29:28,228
Come and eat your breakfast.

423
00:29:28,253 --> 00:29:30,171
I made fried rice and tocino.

424
00:29:30,196 --> 00:29:30,864
It's good.

425
00:29:31,047 --> 00:29:32,273
I'll eat later, Manong.

426
00:29:32,298 --> 00:29:33,883
I'll just wait for
Chino to wake up.

427
00:29:34,092 --> 00:29:35,135
Suit yourself.

428
00:30:15,615 --> 00:30:16,676
Are you going to swim?

429
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:20,217
The water's nice. It's lukewarm.

430
00:30:21,514 --> 00:30:22,557
Where's Chino?

431
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,558
Still asleep.

432
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:25,543
Serves your crazy brother right.

433
00:30:25,807 --> 00:30:27,784
He tried to keep up with Paolo.

434
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:29,786
That guy only has alcohol
running through his veins.

435
00:30:30,077 --> 00:30:31,730
Even paired it up with weed.

436
00:30:32,442 --> 00:30:34,373
How about you? You drink?

437
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:35,842
- You use weed?
- No.

438
00:30:36,022 --> 00:30:37,197
Why not?

439
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,420
You don't want to be
like your brother, huh?

440
00:30:40,329 --> 00:30:41,576
I don't blame you.

441
00:30:42,952 --> 00:30:45,371
You know, you shouldn't
try to be too good.

442
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:47,614
You know the Lord.

443
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:49,061
If you're too good,

444
00:30:49,626 --> 00:30:51,085
he takes you early.

445
00:30:54,106 --> 00:30:56,550
Any reactions here?

446
00:30:56,883 --> 00:30:59,093
I'm talking my head off here,
and you're just being bland.

447
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:01,221
I know. Let's swim. Come.

448
00:31:01,384 --> 00:31:02,488
Hurry!

449
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,152
What's wrong? I'm not
gonna drown you. Come on!

450
00:31:06,392 --> 00:31:08,228
Let's go swimming.

451
00:32:41,112 --> 00:32:41,654
Hey!

452
00:32:41,821 --> 00:32:42,780
Come here.

453
00:32:43,358 --> 00:32:45,110
Why are you always in a hurry?

454
00:32:45,825 --> 00:32:46,826
Have a seat here.

455
00:32:49,787 --> 00:32:51,043
Hurry up.

456
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:56,590
Are you scared of me?

457
00:32:56,986 --> 00:32:58,316
Why would I be scared of you?

458
00:32:59,533 --> 00:33:00,659
Come here.

459
00:33:02,158 --> 00:33:03,326
Why are you laughing?

460
00:33:03,843 --> 00:33:05,199
Because you're so far.

461
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,728
That's why I told
you to scoot over.

462
00:33:07,907 --> 00:33:09,293
You're cute, you know?

463
00:33:10,945 --> 00:33:12,947
You ever kissed a girl?

464
00:33:13,107 --> 00:33:13,941
Sure.

465
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,104
Really? When?

466
00:33:15,772 --> 00:33:17,248
I don't want to talk about it.

467
00:33:17,273 --> 00:33:19,523
You ever grabbed a woman's tits?

468
00:33:20,693 --> 00:33:21,694
That's what I thought.

469
00:33:23,324 --> 00:33:24,405
- Hey.
- There.

470
00:33:24,405 --> 00:33:25,465
This is a breast!

471
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,491
Hey, that's embarrassing.

472
00:33:26,516 --> 00:33:27,642
What's the matter?

473
00:33:28,201 --> 00:33:29,827
Are you shy? That's alright.

474
00:33:29,852 --> 00:33:30,918
I'm not.

475
00:33:32,663 --> 00:33:34,707
- Alright, thank you. I'll be going now.
- What's wrong? It's just a tit!

476
00:33:34,732 --> 00:33:35,691
Thank you.

477
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:38,276
What a bummer.

478
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:50,989
Well, well.

479
00:33:51,014 --> 00:33:52,891
You're awake but
you're still high.

480
00:33:54,234 --> 00:33:56,441
Did you just baptize
Chino's little brother?

481
00:33:56,537 --> 00:33:58,498
No way! I just gave
him a little orientation.

482
00:33:58,523 --> 00:34:00,316
I let him hold my tit.

483
00:34:00,341 --> 00:34:01,449
You're crazy.

484
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:04,545
I'm trying to get you with the Kuya,
but you molested with the baby brother.

485
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,407
Hey, that dude's not a baby anymore.
He can make a baby already.

486
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,070
That was a good sleep.

487
00:34:15,914 --> 00:34:17,874
Ah, fuck. Good shit.

488
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:22,130
What's your name?

489
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:25,591
Why are you always
snooping around the house?

490
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:27,016
Do you know the owner?

491
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:27,624
No.

492
00:34:28,803 --> 00:34:31,389
You're on vacation with the
group next door, aren't you?

493
00:34:32,532 --> 00:34:33,974
Come here.

494
00:34:34,308 --> 00:34:35,685
I don't bite.

495
00:34:37,019 --> 00:34:38,020
Your name?

496
00:34:38,271 --> 00:34:39,230
Martin.

497
00:34:39,272 --> 00:34:40,587
Martin Montecillo.

498
00:34:41,107 --> 00:34:42,024
Wow.

499
00:34:42,578 --> 00:34:44,121
Full name.

500
00:34:44,193 --> 00:34:45,392
My name is Adele.

501
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,071
Nice to meet you, Martin.

502
00:34:47,071 --> 00:34:48,114
Nice to meet you, too.

503
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:51,909
I just noticed.
You're always by yourself.

504
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:54,245
You don't want to
join your other friends?

505
00:34:54,351 --> 00:34:55,852
Those are my brother's friends.

506
00:34:55,877 --> 00:34:56,920
We don't jive.

507
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,603
Okay.

508
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,959
I'm just a plus-one.

509
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,502
I feel sorry for you.

510
00:35:02,854 --> 00:35:05,606
You're on a vacation,
but you're all by yourself.

511
00:35:05,631 --> 00:35:09,509
I'd choose this over than
forcing myself in their group.

512
00:35:10,423 --> 00:35:11,512
That's true.

513
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,239
I'll be going now.

514
00:35:13,264 --> 00:35:15,141
Take care, Martin.

515
00:36:07,985 --> 00:36:08,986
What are you even doing there?

516
00:36:08,986 --> 00:36:10,905
Hurry up, I really have to pee!

517
00:36:11,697 --> 00:36:12,281
Hey!

518
00:36:12,657 --> 00:36:14,909
You're fucking jacking
off again, aren't you?

519
00:36:15,076 --> 00:36:16,911
Hey! Hurry up!

520
00:36:18,538 --> 00:36:19,580
Martin!

521
00:36:23,987 --> 00:36:25,422
Can I ask a question?

522
00:36:25,814 --> 00:36:27,046
To whom?

523
00:36:27,088 --> 00:36:28,384
To Martin.

524
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:31,092
Nadine has a question for you.

525
00:36:31,637 --> 00:36:33,597
It's just a bit personal, okay?

526
00:36:33,894 --> 00:36:35,409
Come on. Just shoot.

527
00:36:35,434 --> 00:36:36,393
Okay.

528
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:37,890
Martin...

529
00:36:40,017 --> 00:36:41,228
You're still a virgin, aren't you?

530
00:36:43,646 --> 00:36:45,565
Why? If Martin's
still a virgin...

531
00:36:45,648 --> 00:36:47,853
Are you willing to
help him with that?

532
00:36:47,917 --> 00:36:48,960
Is that okay with you, Chino?

533
00:36:48,985 --> 00:36:50,653
Do what you want. I don't care.

534
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:52,513
You know what?
You're all perverts.

535
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,297
You thought about all
kinds of naughty shit

536
00:36:53,322 --> 00:36:54,574
just from a simple question.

537
00:36:54,615 --> 00:36:57,118
Are you sure?
My little brother?

538
00:36:57,143 --> 00:36:58,052
What? What am I?

539
00:36:58,077 --> 00:37:00,888
He hasn't even
kissed a girl yet.

540
00:37:00,913 --> 00:37:01,914
How can you be so sure of that?

541
00:37:01,939 --> 00:37:03,224
At his age?

542
00:37:03,249 --> 00:37:04,502
He doesn't know anything but...

543
00:37:06,072 --> 00:37:08,254
- Fuck.
- That's what you think you know.

544
00:37:08,854 --> 00:37:10,690
Why not?
What did you do, huh?

545
00:37:10,715 --> 00:37:12,798
Nothing! I did nothing.

546
00:37:12,842 --> 00:37:14,844
You're a crazy bitch. What
did you do to Chino's little bro?

547
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:15,828
I told you. Nothing.

548
00:37:16,971 --> 00:37:18,587
Fuck, Chino.

549
00:37:18,948 --> 00:37:21,075
Step it up, bro. Your little brother
got way ahead of you.

550
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,103
What am I supposed to
do other than jerk off?

551
00:37:26,022 --> 00:37:27,064
Manong, I'm just
going to wash this.

552
00:37:27,106 --> 00:37:28,941
I got it. Just put it over here.

553
00:37:30,192 --> 00:37:31,235
Go.

554
00:37:38,932 --> 00:37:40,934
I can't talk for long.
I'm in a meeting.

555
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:44,017
I just wanted to ask if
you're coming over tonight.

556
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,500
I'll be calling.
Or through text.

557
00:37:47,292 --> 00:37:48,335
Robbie.

558
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,292
I'm with my Dad.
I can't talk right now.

559
00:38:39,804 --> 00:38:42,807
I just want to know
what this is.

560
00:38:45,428 --> 00:38:46,793
What are you talking about?

561
00:38:47,372 --> 00:38:48,942
What's your plan?

562
00:38:51,297 --> 00:38:52,339
Plan?

563
00:38:54,068 --> 00:38:57,071
For me. For us!

564
00:38:57,256 --> 00:38:58,923
We're talking about this again?

565
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:01,567
Look at you. You're mad again.

566
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,411
I don't know what else to
say without getting you angry.

567
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:12,461
It's not important if I'm
going to be happy or angry.

568
00:39:13,172 --> 00:39:15,174
What's important for me
is to know the truth.

569
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,384
Where do I really
place in your life?

570
00:39:33,774 --> 00:39:34,775
Hey!

571
00:39:35,443 --> 00:39:37,278
Wait!

572
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,781
Come here!

573
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,901
Why do you look like
you've seen a ghost?

574
00:40:16,942 --> 00:40:18,986
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

575
00:40:19,111 --> 00:40:20,671
Why are you saying sorry?

576
00:40:20,696 --> 00:40:22,740
Have you done
anything wrong to me?

577
00:40:25,367 --> 00:40:27,244
How old are you, Martin?

578
00:40:27,703 --> 00:40:30,456
Seventeen. But I'm turning
eighteen next month.

579
00:40:31,422 --> 00:40:32,830
Happy birthday!

580
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:35,377
Where are your friends?

581
00:40:35,736 --> 00:40:36,962
They're still at the house.

582
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,716
Do you have any plans today?

583
00:40:41,842 --> 00:40:42,843
Nothing much.

584
00:40:43,056 --> 00:40:44,048
To chill, probably.

585
00:40:44,261 --> 00:40:45,221
Alright.

586
00:40:45,575 --> 00:40:47,577
Both of us don't any plans, so...

587
00:40:47,861 --> 00:40:49,438
Just hang out with me.

588
00:40:50,643 --> 00:40:53,025
Come on! Don't you want to?

589
00:40:54,438 --> 00:40:56,816
Aren't you coming?

590
00:40:58,484 --> 00:40:59,693
Are you still in school?

591
00:40:59,985 --> 00:41:01,028
I hope so.

592
00:41:01,445 --> 00:41:02,154
Yeah.

593
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,384
What year are you in?

594
00:41:05,074 --> 00:41:06,116
Grade eleven.

595
00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:12,681
You're only in senior high?

596
00:41:14,441 --> 00:41:15,442
What's wrong?

597
00:41:15,668 --> 00:41:17,711
Nothing. I'm just shocked.

598
00:41:18,295 --> 00:41:19,673
Grade eleven?

599
00:41:25,761 --> 00:41:27,126
Why aren't you eating?

600
00:41:27,638 --> 00:41:28,681
Are you full?

601
00:41:29,128 --> 00:41:30,431
Or are you just shy?

602
00:41:31,149 --> 00:41:32,740
I already ate.

603
00:41:32,768 --> 00:41:35,271
Well, why didn't you say so?

604
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:37,022
I cooked a whole lot for you.

605
00:41:37,273 --> 00:41:38,399
I got embarrassed.

606
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,400
Then...

607
00:41:39,817 --> 00:41:41,277
Eat it.

608
00:41:41,346 --> 00:41:43,836
It's bad to waste food.

609
00:41:47,533 --> 00:41:48,534
You know...

610
00:41:48,868 --> 00:41:50,427
My youngest brother?

611
00:41:50,452 --> 00:41:51,161
He's like...

612
00:41:52,663 --> 00:41:54,331
Two years younger than you.

613
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:55,509
Right.

614
00:41:55,827 --> 00:41:57,126
Because he's in grade nine.

615
00:41:57,751 --> 00:41:58,878
Was it grade nine?

616
00:42:01,255 --> 00:42:02,715
Do you have a lot of siblings?

617
00:42:03,591 --> 00:42:04,967
It's just me and
my older brother.

618
00:42:05,926 --> 00:42:07,011
Must be nice to be you.

619
00:42:07,928 --> 00:42:09,013
Just the two of you.

620
00:42:09,555 --> 00:42:12,259
Us? We're five in the family.

621
00:42:13,726 --> 00:42:15,394
We're not a rich family.

622
00:42:15,436 --> 00:42:19,732
That's why I left them abroad, and,
that's why I'm here in the Philippines.

623
00:42:23,027 --> 00:42:24,194
Enough about me.

624
00:42:24,653 --> 00:42:26,155
It's your turn to
tell me something.

625
00:42:26,405 --> 00:42:27,573
What will I even tell you?

626
00:42:29,825 --> 00:42:31,243
Do you have a girlfriend?

627
00:42:34,121 --> 00:42:37,041
I don't know if she's
my girlfriend already.

628
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:39,418
How did that happen?

629
00:42:39,543 --> 00:42:41,420
I really don't know.

630
00:42:44,298 --> 00:42:45,424
Do you like her?

631
00:42:48,218 --> 00:42:49,345
Does she like you?

632
00:42:50,603 --> 00:42:52,605
I think so. Or so I thought.

633
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,672
Or so you thought?

634
00:42:55,935 --> 00:42:57,561
You have a huge problem.

635
00:43:00,522 --> 00:43:01,565
Can I ask you something?

636
00:43:02,608 --> 00:43:04,568
Why are you all by
yourself in this house?

637
00:43:04,652 --> 00:43:06,528
Long story.

638
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:08,572
But I'm not really
here by myself.

639
00:43:09,227 --> 00:43:10,877
That's my boyfriend's house.

640
00:43:13,035 --> 00:43:14,495
We're just the same, you know.

641
00:43:15,037 --> 00:43:17,915
I don't really know
if he's my boyfriend.

642
00:43:18,211 --> 00:43:20,080
Maybe I'm just
assuming everything.

643
00:43:21,487 --> 00:43:23,531
But we're seeing each other
for almost three years already.

644
00:43:24,129 --> 00:43:26,548
Three years and you still
don't know if you're together?

645
00:43:27,132 --> 00:43:28,759
He doesn't want
to talk about it.

646
00:43:29,111 --> 00:43:30,135
Why not?

647
00:43:32,012 --> 00:43:35,432
He said that the important
thing is we're together.

648
00:43:36,767 --> 00:43:37,810
That's all.

649
00:43:39,186 --> 00:43:41,105
I shouldn't expect
anything else.

650
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:44,472
If he wanted to be together with you,
why doesn't he want to be your boyfriend?

651
00:43:45,922 --> 00:43:47,758
He says it's not important.

652
00:43:50,106 --> 00:43:51,259
Does he love you?

653
00:43:52,219 --> 00:43:53,262
I hope so.

654
00:43:53,747 --> 00:43:54,789
Maybe.

655
00:43:58,586 --> 00:44:00,118
Let's not talk about it.

656
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:01,792
I hope he loves you.

657
00:44:02,459 --> 00:44:05,173
People still hope for that?
I don't necessarily agree.

658
00:44:05,619 --> 00:44:09,014
Personally, if two people get
together and are okay with it,

659
00:44:09,133 --> 00:44:10,592
Then it's okay.

660
00:44:11,848 --> 00:44:13,734
I think about that sometimes.

661
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:15,586
- You know?
- What?

662
00:44:15,628 --> 00:44:18,040
That love is a hindrance.

663
00:44:18,454 --> 00:44:21,274
Just because you love him, but
you don't know if he loves you?

664
00:44:26,483 --> 00:44:27,681
Hey, where are you going?

665
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:29,209
I don't wanna talk to you.

666
00:44:29,695 --> 00:44:30,571
Are you mad?

667
00:44:32,656 --> 00:44:33,490
I just...

668
00:44:33,532 --> 00:44:35,451
You keep on saying things that...

669
00:44:35,492 --> 00:44:36,660
You're making me cry!

670
00:44:48,547 --> 00:44:49,840
Fuck, this is some good shit.

671
00:44:57,513 --> 00:44:59,930
Oh? Where's he been?

672
00:45:00,726 --> 00:45:02,868
I think he went to
the house next door.

673
00:45:03,025 --> 00:45:04,271
What even is there?

674
00:45:04,646 --> 00:45:06,690
Maybe he went to see the
woman that we saw yesterday.

675
00:45:07,316 --> 00:45:08,417
Martin?

676
00:45:08,442 --> 00:45:09,752
- Yeah.
- Trying to get some already?

677
00:45:09,777 --> 00:45:11,540
- Fuck me.
- Hey, Martin!

678
00:45:11,695 --> 00:45:12,696
Where have you been, huh?

679
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,159
There.

680
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:18,077
"There".

681
00:45:18,102 --> 00:45:19,187
- What do you mean, "there"?
- "There".

682
00:45:19,369 --> 00:45:21,764
- The walk of triumph.
- This asshole, I'm still talking-

683
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:23,182
- Come here!
- Hey, that's enough!

684
00:45:23,207 --> 00:45:24,430
Mister Masturbater!

685
00:45:26,335 --> 00:45:27,929
- I'll bet he's going to do it again.
- Don't hit your head!

686
00:45:27,954 --> 00:45:29,254
He's going to do it again.

687
00:45:29,279 --> 00:45:31,281
- Yeah, I bet.
- You have too much energy!

688
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:34,945
Martin!

689
00:46:36,883 --> 00:46:38,760
Did you go to the
house next door?

690
00:46:40,382 --> 00:46:42,426
I saw you walking back.

691
00:46:43,357 --> 00:46:46,746
Do you know anything about
the woman who lives next door?

692
00:46:48,584 --> 00:46:50,082
She doesn't live there.

693
00:46:50,669 --> 00:46:52,418
She's a guest, like you guys.

694
00:46:53,088 --> 00:46:54,089
Most likely...

695
00:46:56,049 --> 00:46:58,208
She's the woman of
the Congressman's son.

696
00:46:58,369 --> 00:46:59,370
The woman?

697
00:46:59,395 --> 00:47:02,398
Yeah! The Congressman's son is Robbie.

698
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,356
He has a wife and two kids.
Sometimes, they come there for vacation.

699
00:47:07,477 --> 00:47:08,520
Did you meet the woman?

700
00:47:10,314 --> 00:47:12,939
Hey. Be careful, okay?

701
00:47:13,108 --> 00:47:14,523
Be careful of what?

702
00:47:14,789 --> 00:47:16,246
Don't let yourself
get in trouble!

703
00:47:32,377 --> 00:47:33,613
Tell me the truth, bro.

704
00:47:34,004 --> 00:47:35,047
Is she your girlfriend, already?

705
00:47:36,089 --> 00:47:38,967
Why? You want to
fuck her, don't you?

706
00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:40,052
You're crazy. I'm just asking.

707
00:47:40,093 --> 00:47:41,863
Shut up. Admit it.

708
00:47:41,888 --> 00:47:44,277
Dude, Nadine is
crazy in bed. Flexible.

709
00:47:44,389 --> 00:47:45,474
She's a cheerleader you know.

710
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:47,865
You're still high
from last night.

711
00:47:47,939 --> 00:47:50,942
Shut up. You know, Nadine
is easy to negotiate with.

712
00:47:51,438 --> 00:47:53,148
Do you want me
to tell her for you?

713
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:54,399
Tell her what?

714
00:47:54,691 --> 00:47:56,026
That you want to
fuck her brains out.

715
00:47:56,318 --> 00:47:57,319
You're too crazy.

716
00:47:57,611 --> 00:47:58,612
Don't believe me?

717
00:47:59,696 --> 00:48:00,245
Nadine!

718
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:01,793
Hey! Fuck, Pao! What
the hell are you doing?

719
00:48:01,818 --> 00:48:03,075
I'm helping you.
Don't be a pussy.

720
00:48:03,689 --> 00:48:05,301
I'm telling you.
She's game, dude.

721
00:48:05,431 --> 00:48:06,432
Holy shit.

722
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:08,309
- Shit...
- Here we go.

723
00:48:08,455 --> 00:48:09,998
How about her? Look, look.

724
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,041
You want that?

725
00:48:14,127 --> 00:48:15,489
Fuck, she's so hot.

726
00:48:15,742 --> 00:48:17,761
With looks like that,
somebody owns her for sure.

727
00:48:17,855 --> 00:48:19,107
For the meantime only.

728
00:48:19,381 --> 00:48:21,592
Listen. We know who
lives in that house.

729
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:22,734
And that?

730
00:48:23,303 --> 00:48:26,014
That's the Flavor of the Month
of the Congressman's son.

731
00:48:26,431 --> 00:48:27,391
Fuck. Look at that.

732
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:30,018
So, she's with a bigwig.

733
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,019
For sure.

734
00:48:31,044 --> 00:48:33,355
There was a time, that
place was full of starlets.

735
00:48:33,413 --> 00:48:35,832
Every day, we see wannabe
actresses wading about. You know?

736
00:48:35,857 --> 00:48:37,246
That guy's good.

737
00:48:37,317 --> 00:48:40,946
What do you mean, "good"? Dude, you
only need money to get pussy like that!

738
00:48:41,488 --> 00:48:44,132
I'll bet you she's only
worth 50 thousand.

739
00:48:44,157 --> 00:48:45,684
Her? Come on.
She's sexy as fuck.

740
00:48:46,576 --> 00:48:48,370
But she looks like she's
a good fuck. Am I right?

741
00:48:49,705 --> 00:48:50,372
For sure.

742
00:48:51,415 --> 00:48:53,292
And look. She looks like...

743
00:48:53,292 --> 00:48:54,918
Like she's the bomb
at giving blowjobs.

744
00:48:55,658 --> 00:48:57,576
Fuck you. How'd you know?

745
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,223
I mean, just look at
the shape of her mouth.

746
00:49:01,091 --> 00:49:02,324
Fuck, dude.

747
00:49:02,551 --> 00:49:04,052
You're out with it, man.
You're even closing your eyes.

748
00:49:04,077 --> 00:49:05,487
Looks like you're having
the time of your life.

749
00:49:05,512 --> 00:49:06,471
- Man, you never know.
- But she's really hot.

750
00:49:06,471 --> 00:49:08,307
Maybe it'll happen tonight.

751
00:49:15,022 --> 00:49:17,166
Dude, I think she's
fucking playing us.

752
00:49:17,983 --> 00:49:19,026
She knows. Look!

753
00:49:19,067 --> 00:49:20,986
She knows that
we're looking at her.

754
00:49:21,326 --> 00:49:24,288
Shit. I'm getting a hard-on, man.

755
00:49:24,948 --> 00:49:25,949
Ugh...

756
00:49:25,974 --> 00:49:27,251
I can't take it anymore, man.
you down?

757
00:49:27,336 --> 00:49:28,295
Shall we make a move?

758
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,155
Dude, are you crazy?

759
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:33,915
Just come with me, man.
It won't take long.

760
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:34,941
Ma'am?

761
00:49:34,966 --> 00:49:36,926
You scared me. What's with you?

762
00:49:37,502 --> 00:49:39,830
Sir told me to go ahead.
He's following in a while.

763
00:49:40,964 --> 00:49:42,966
Why didn't he text
or call, at least?

764
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:45,761
Because he's with
Ma'am Ginny and his kids.

765
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,473
They went to church. It's his
grandfather's death anniversary.

766
00:49:49,967 --> 00:49:53,237
So after he goes to church with
his family, he'll come home to me?

767
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:54,269
Am I right?

768
00:49:57,064 --> 00:49:58,020
That's it?

769
00:49:58,986 --> 00:49:59,820
Shit.

770
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:02,027
An intervention.

771
00:50:02,402 --> 00:50:03,362
Who the hell was that?

772
00:50:04,029 --> 00:50:05,989
An employee of her owner, maybe.

773
00:50:06,073 --> 00:50:07,345
You guys are disgusting.

774
00:50:07,699 --> 00:50:09,323
Like rabid fucking dogs.

775
00:50:09,451 --> 00:50:11,453
You've been ogling at the
neighbor for God knows how long.

776
00:50:11,518 --> 00:50:13,229
Wow! Jealous much?

777
00:50:13,622 --> 00:50:14,623
"Jealous"?

778
00:50:15,332 --> 00:50:18,752
You're just pigs. Look at your shorts!
You have hard-ons!

779
00:50:18,752 --> 00:50:20,420
It's obvious that you're horny for her.

780
00:50:21,505 --> 00:50:23,548
Wait! Chino tells me
that his hard-on's for you.

781
00:50:23,799 --> 00:50:24,758
Really?

782
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:26,468
Thank you.

783
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:30,972
- Fuck, dude. It's really showing.
- I know.

784
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:56,053
Ma'am? I just
got a text from Sir.

785
00:50:56,331 --> 00:50:58,333
I know. He's on his way.

786
00:51:15,809 --> 00:51:17,769
Are you hungry?

787
00:51:18,812 --> 00:51:19,621
The other two?

788
00:51:19,646 --> 00:51:21,773
By the beach, making a bonfire.

789
00:51:21,773 --> 00:51:22,274
Okay.

790
00:51:22,274 --> 00:51:24,126
They're going to get wasted again.

791
00:51:24,151 --> 00:51:26,173
Manong Dado, do
we still have tequila?

792
00:51:28,488 --> 00:51:30,447
Alright.

793
00:51:47,174 --> 00:51:48,091
Don't we have enough back there?

794
00:51:48,133 --> 00:51:48,758
No, we don't.

795
00:51:49,009 --> 00:51:51,011
Here. Take this. I got this one.

796
00:52:09,654 --> 00:52:10,405
What is it?

797
00:52:10,405 --> 00:52:11,281
Do you need anything?

798
00:52:11,281 --> 00:52:12,324
I'm looking for...

799
00:52:12,324 --> 00:52:13,283
- For...
- Who?

800
00:52:13,325 --> 00:52:14,326
For Adele?

801
00:52:14,409 --> 00:52:15,908
What do you need from her?

802
00:52:16,472 --> 00:52:17,868
Martin!

803
00:52:18,829 --> 00:52:19,789
You know this guy, Ma'am?

804
00:52:19,998 --> 00:52:21,892
That's Martin. What's
the problem with you?

805
00:52:21,917 --> 00:52:23,705
He's on vacation with
the guys next door.

806
00:52:25,003 --> 00:52:26,004
He's my friend.

807
00:52:26,463 --> 00:52:27,422
Next door neighbor.

808
00:52:27,964 --> 00:52:29,925
Didn't you just tell me
that you're going to buy ice?

809
00:52:31,009 --> 00:52:32,416
Before your Sir arrives?

810
00:52:32,761 --> 00:52:33,762
Okay, Ma'am.

811
00:52:35,764 --> 00:52:36,848
Come with me.

812
00:52:38,141 --> 00:52:39,100
Bad timing.

813
00:52:39,125 --> 00:52:40,884
What's up? Is there a problem?

814
00:52:40,977 --> 00:52:43,939
No. I just didn't know
you had company.

815
00:52:44,022 --> 00:52:45,720
My boyfriend is on his way here.

816
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,498
That's his sidekick and driver, Simon.

817
00:52:48,193 --> 00:52:49,236
So, we can't stay for long.

818
00:52:50,529 --> 00:52:52,705
I thought you were
just mad at me.

819
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:54,774
That's nothing!
I'm really just busy.

820
00:52:54,991 --> 00:52:57,220
Okay. You really have to go now.

821
00:53:12,926 --> 00:53:15,428
Hey! Come here, fucker.
Help us out.

822
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,491
You don't have a chance with the
neighbor. The guard is there, asshole.

823
00:53:19,516 --> 00:53:20,600
He has a better chance
with the guard, man.

824
00:53:20,642 --> 00:53:22,035
Hurry up and come here.

825
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:22,811
Let's go.

826
00:53:23,228 --> 00:53:24,521
This is because you
jack off all the time.

827
00:53:25,063 --> 00:53:25,981
Stop jacking off
for once, will you?

828
00:53:26,022 --> 00:53:26,982
Come on.

829
00:53:27,315 --> 00:53:27,983
Here.

830
00:53:28,692 --> 00:53:29,651
This one.

831
00:53:30,151 --> 00:53:31,486
- Take it. You carry that.
- It's sharp.

832
00:53:31,902 --> 00:53:33,227
Don't jack it off, all right?

833
00:53:33,446 --> 00:53:36,166
That's not a fucking dick, dude.

834
00:53:45,417 --> 00:53:46,960
- Were you able to buy some ice?
- Yes, Sir.

835
00:53:47,085 --> 00:53:48,517
Get the food at the back.

836
00:53:49,504 --> 00:53:50,541
Okay, Sir.

837
00:53:50,589 --> 00:53:51,306
Wait.

838
00:53:51,448 --> 00:53:52,274
Where is she?

839
00:53:52,365 --> 00:53:53,556
Preparing.

840
00:53:53,925 --> 00:53:54,634
Okay.

841
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:08,206
- Adele.
- I thought you wouldn't make it tonight.

842
00:54:08,231 --> 00:54:09,416
I told you. I'll try.

843
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:11,368
You're too busy nowadays.

844
00:54:11,943 --> 00:54:13,194
When am I never busy?

845
00:54:13,194 --> 00:54:16,744
Right. You were with
your family the whole day.

846
00:54:16,939 --> 00:54:19,233
It's my grandfather's
death anniversary.

847
00:54:19,284 --> 00:54:20,285
Yeah. He told me.

848
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:23,611
Simon and I will prepare the food.
You might be hungry.

849
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:31,963
Fuck. Shit.

850
00:54:32,505 --> 00:54:33,465
Fuck, shit!

851
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,844
Fuck!

852
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:40,930
Shit.

853
00:54:42,265 --> 00:54:44,267
Sir, are you okay?

854
00:54:44,441 --> 00:54:46,275
I'm fine. I probably
ate too much.

855
00:54:46,811 --> 00:54:48,355
What's wrong?
What are you feeling?

856
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:51,499
Gas pains. This is
probably just indigestion.

857
00:54:51,524 --> 00:54:54,361
Don't worry about it... Just
go help Adele in the kitchen.

858
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,782
Simon! Simon!
Please bring whiskey.

859
00:54:59,574 --> 00:55:00,673
Okay, Sir.

860
00:55:01,067 --> 00:55:04,070
Fuck. Shit. What
is happening to me?

861
00:55:06,413 --> 00:55:08,290
Okay, guys.

862
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:09,822
Bottoms up, okay?

863
00:55:10,627 --> 00:55:12,395
Wait, there's something missing.

864
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,546
Where's the salt and the lemon?

865
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:15,548
Salt and lemon? Here!

866
00:55:15,853 --> 00:55:17,484
- Are you serious?
- Calamansi. Stop being a bitch.

867
00:55:17,509 --> 00:55:19,126
I'm going to suck
on that? Calamansi?

868
00:55:19,151 --> 00:55:21,111
Just do it!

869
00:55:21,454 --> 00:55:23,373
Alright, get this.
Whose shot is this?

870
00:55:23,598 --> 00:55:24,599
Here.

871
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,559
Bro.

872
00:55:26,957 --> 00:55:28,181
And of course. My brother.

873
00:55:28,603 --> 00:55:29,562
Just one shot.

874
00:55:29,604 --> 00:55:31,481
I don't drink tequila.

875
00:55:31,606 --> 00:55:33,108
Just one shot. Please.

876
00:55:33,108 --> 00:55:34,109
Just a bit.

877
00:55:35,151 --> 00:55:37,070
Dude, nobody dies
from one shot of tequila.

878
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:37,821
This fucking guy...

879
00:55:37,821 --> 00:55:38,530
Just a bit.

880
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:40,876
Just fucking do it, dude.
Don't be a pussy. It's just a shot!

881
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:45,533
There we go! Alright, okay.
At the count of three!

882
00:55:45,558 --> 00:55:48,436
One. Two. Three!

883
00:55:55,313 --> 00:55:56,718
Are you okay?

884
00:55:57,361 --> 00:55:59,009
Have you seen
your brother's face?

885
00:55:59,211 --> 00:56:01,005
So? Are you happy now?

886
00:56:02,751 --> 00:56:05,342
- Tell Mama. I don't care.
- Here. Calamansi.

887
00:56:09,602 --> 00:56:10,603
Why are you so quiet?

888
00:56:13,064 --> 00:56:14,107
It's strange.

889
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:18,149
Just eat, okay?
I know you're tired.

890
00:56:22,741 --> 00:56:24,617
So, are you gonna
go home to them?

891
00:56:29,038 --> 00:56:30,525
Why did I even ask?

892
00:56:33,951 --> 00:56:34,952
Adele...

893
00:56:34,977 --> 00:56:38,767
I know what you're gonna say,
and I understand.

894
00:56:38,888 --> 00:56:41,673
If you're here,
then you're here.

895
00:56:41,782 --> 00:56:43,617
I should be happy with
what you can give me.

896
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:45,353
Right?

897
00:56:46,264 --> 00:56:48,450
Don't worry, Adele.
I promise you.

898
00:56:48,475 --> 00:56:50,095
Don't make promises
you can't keep.

899
00:56:50,158 --> 00:56:51,400
I don't want to hear it.

900
00:56:51,425 --> 00:56:54,678
I might get my hopes up
and end up getting hurt.

901
00:56:57,817 --> 00:56:58,860
Just eat.

902
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:11,498
Wait.

903
00:57:11,748 --> 00:57:13,041
- What? Why?
- I need to take a leak.

904
00:57:13,066 --> 00:57:13,995
Why?

905
00:57:14,834 --> 00:57:16,586
You know what...
Just do it in the sea.

906
00:57:17,045 --> 00:57:18,213
- Yuck!
- I won't look.

907
00:57:18,338 --> 00:57:19,339
You're so disgusting!

908
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:22,025
It's dark! Plus, I do my
business there as well.

909
00:57:22,383 --> 00:57:24,302
So that's why there are so
many dead fish floating around.

910
00:57:24,502 --> 00:57:27,380
"Dead fish". Asshole.

911
00:57:32,352 --> 00:57:34,312
So? You game?

912
00:57:34,426 --> 00:57:35,385
Shut up.

913
00:57:35,605 --> 00:57:37,524
Fuck, dude, I told you it was okay.

914
00:57:37,549 --> 00:57:39,467
And it's also okay with her.

915
00:57:40,902 --> 00:57:42,487
Stop being a pussy. She's drunk!

916
00:57:46,407 --> 00:57:47,861
Go, bro! Go, bro!

917
00:57:49,052 --> 00:57:50,780
Stop the timid act, asshole.

918
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,163
How about you?
You wanna try this?

919
00:57:56,709 --> 00:57:57,335
Hey!

920
00:57:57,794 --> 00:58:00,163
Don't even think about
trying to join your brother!

921
00:58:04,759 --> 00:58:06,761
What are you doing here?

922
00:58:08,137 --> 00:58:09,497
Okay.

923
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:11,132
Pao sent you?

924
00:58:11,192 --> 00:58:12,559
I want it, too.

925
00:58:12,851 --> 00:58:14,477
Oh. You want it.

926
00:58:14,519 --> 00:58:15,562
What do you want?

927
00:58:18,523 --> 00:58:20,441
Is this what you want?

928
00:58:45,383 --> 00:58:47,302
You like it? Or you don't?

929
00:59:47,528 --> 00:59:49,571
Are they waiting
for you at home?

930
00:59:50,114 --> 00:59:51,115
Not yet.

931
00:59:52,992 --> 00:59:54,911
I'll probably try and
lie down for a bit.

932
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:59,907
Do you want to lie
down the bedroom?

933
01:00:00,667 --> 01:00:05,254
I could because I had
a bit of indigestion earlier.

934
01:00:06,965 --> 01:00:07,966
Sir, are you done eating?

935
01:00:08,007 --> 01:00:08,967
Can I take it away?

936
01:00:10,802 --> 01:00:13,321
Sure. I'm going to
lie down for a bit.

937
01:00:13,346 --> 01:00:15,431
I'm going to get some rest.

938
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:19,811
Sir, do you want me
to bring you home?

939
01:00:20,979 --> 01:00:23,383
What about the car you brought?
You're going to have a hard time.

940
01:00:23,408 --> 01:00:26,188
Just take the leftovers home.
Give it to your family.

941
01:00:26,593 --> 01:00:28,032
Okay, Sir. Thank you.

942
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,008
You should get some rest.

943
01:01:00,226 --> 01:01:01,269
It's hot.

944
01:01:01,978 --> 01:01:03,852
I'll open the aircon.

945
01:01:32,758 --> 01:01:34,676
Are you still hot?

946
01:01:36,095 --> 01:01:38,890
I thought we were
going to get some rest?

947
01:06:33,851 --> 01:06:35,895
I'm sorry. There's no round two.

948
01:06:36,084 --> 01:06:37,085
You okay?

949
01:06:37,463 --> 01:06:39,211
I almost choked because of you.

950
01:06:39,411 --> 01:06:41,516
Not because of the
size of your dick, but...

951
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:43,553
It looks like you haven't
came in a long time.

952
01:06:44,624 --> 01:06:45,921
It's okay.

953
01:06:46,113 --> 01:06:47,156
Love you.

954
01:06:59,752 --> 01:07:00,753
What happened?

955
01:07:00,795 --> 01:07:01,879
You're an asshole!

956
01:07:02,913 --> 01:07:04,874
Did you make my
bestfriend happy?

957
01:07:04,899 --> 01:07:06,776
He's gone.

958
01:07:06,925 --> 01:07:09,000
Exhausted. Sleeping like a baby.

959
01:07:10,524 --> 01:07:12,610
You're too good, Nads.
Come give me a kiss.

960
01:07:19,714 --> 01:07:21,358
You're really insatiable.

961
01:07:21,414 --> 01:07:24,235
Now, your friendship
with Chino is sealed.

962
01:07:24,402 --> 01:07:28,438
Somewhere in your mouth, your
bestfriend's cum is swimming freely.

963
01:07:32,493 --> 01:07:33,744
You're an asshole, Nadine!

964
01:07:33,923 --> 01:07:35,382
What's the matter?

965
01:07:35,576 --> 01:07:38,304
Relax! Nobody gets pregnant
just from the mouth.

966
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:40,501
Fuck you!

967
01:07:41,282 --> 01:07:42,325
You're too disgusting!

968
01:07:43,295 --> 01:07:44,610
You bitch!

969
01:07:46,321 --> 01:07:47,363
Look.

970
01:07:47,465 --> 01:07:48,633
I promise. Okay?

971
01:07:50,094 --> 01:07:51,137
There you go again.

972
01:07:51,633 --> 01:07:53,635
Be careful of your promises.

973
01:07:55,535 --> 01:07:57,304
I know you're
having a hard time.

974
01:07:57,329 --> 01:08:00,207
But I'll make sure to
always take care of you.

975
01:08:00,848 --> 01:08:03,518
Please don't tell
me you love me.

976
01:08:06,694 --> 01:08:07,695
Why not?

977
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:10,679
Because if you really love me,
you're going to show it.

978
01:08:11,907 --> 01:08:13,951
Don't make promises
you can't keep.

979
01:08:16,569 --> 01:08:18,529
Just remember. Okay?

980
01:08:19,604 --> 01:08:21,304
I know they're waiting for you.

981
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:24,753
Go. Get dressed.

982
01:08:25,379 --> 01:08:27,256
Before you travel.

983
01:08:39,059 --> 01:08:40,144
Okay. Yes.

984
01:08:41,061 --> 01:08:42,146
Wait. Wait.

985
01:08:42,563 --> 01:08:43,948
What's wrong?

986
01:08:44,316 --> 01:08:45,416
- Sir!
- Are you okay?

987
01:08:45,441 --> 01:08:46,400
Are you okay?

988
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,444
I'm okay. I just ate
too much. Okay.

989
01:08:48,444 --> 01:08:49,528
Sir, did you take
your medicine earlier?

990
01:08:49,528 --> 01:08:50,654
Of course. I took it.

991
01:08:50,654 --> 01:08:52,882
Are you sure you don't wanna
get him to take you home?

992
01:08:52,907 --> 01:08:53,866
I'm okay, I'm okay.

993
01:08:53,866 --> 01:08:54,992
He was feeling bad
even a while ago.

994
01:08:54,992 --> 01:08:57,828
- This is just from the heat, it's fine.
- Let's just take him to the doctor.

995
01:08:57,828 --> 01:08:58,704
Let's take him to the doctor.

996
01:08:58,704 --> 01:08:59,830
No need, no need. Okay?

997
01:08:59,997 --> 01:09:01,665
- Sir, I'll just drive you home. Okay?
- These are just gas pains, okay?

998
01:09:01,665 --> 01:09:02,875
I got it, I got it. Okay.

999
01:09:03,334 --> 01:09:03,876
Sir!

1000
01:09:03,876 --> 01:09:05,878
- Sir!
- Robbie!

1001
01:09:05,878 --> 01:09:06,670
Sir! What's your problem?

1002
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:09,131
What's happening? Let's
take him to the hospital!

1003
01:09:09,131 --> 01:09:10,745
- Where is the nearest hospital!
- I'll handle this!

1004
01:09:10,883 --> 01:09:11,967
- I'll handle this, just stay here!
- Robbie!

1005
01:09:11,967 --> 01:09:12,468
I'm coming!

1006
01:09:12,468 --> 01:09:13,566
That's not going to happen!

1007
01:09:14,011 --> 01:09:15,095
You can't be seen by people.

1008
01:09:15,095 --> 01:09:16,614
- Just stay here!
- Hey, Robbie!

1009
01:09:16,639 --> 01:09:18,228
What happened to you?

1010
01:09:18,253 --> 01:09:19,992
You were okay a
while ago, right?

1011
01:09:20,017 --> 01:09:21,573
What happened?

1012
01:09:22,061 --> 01:09:23,145
Robbie!

1013
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:24,547
What's your deal?
Get out of the way!

1014
01:09:26,707 --> 01:09:28,164
Robbie!

1015
01:09:40,162 --> 01:09:41,163
Martin.

1016
01:09:43,457 --> 01:09:44,644
What are you doing?

1017
01:09:46,001 --> 01:09:47,002
Did you just cry?

1018
01:09:48,148 --> 01:09:49,191
What happened to you?

1019
01:09:49,859 --> 01:09:50,860
Nothing.

1020
01:09:51,382 --> 01:09:53,191
Don't tell me that
you went back to

1021
01:09:53,216 --> 01:09:55,176
the woman who lives next door.

1022
01:09:57,054 --> 01:09:59,056
Martin, she's a mistress.

1023
01:09:59,915 --> 01:10:01,815
She belongs to the
Congressman's son.

1024
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:06,940
Oh, okay. I get it.

1025
01:10:07,878 --> 01:10:09,880
You saw something you
weren't supposed to see.

1026
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:11,993
You hurt yourself.

1027
01:10:12,704 --> 01:10:14,425
That's because you don't think!

1028
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:16,135
You look where
you're not supposed to.

1029
01:10:16,583 --> 01:10:17,751
You don't know her.

1030
01:10:18,075 --> 01:10:19,577
And you? You know her?
Is that it?

1031
01:10:20,703 --> 01:10:21,855
It is what it is.

1032
01:10:22,496 --> 01:10:24,675
My father told me
this before he died,

1033
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:26,437
You only have
two choices in life.

1034
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:30,101
To be the one who victimizes,
or to be the victim.

1035
01:10:30,588 --> 01:10:32,590
To use, or be used.

1036
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:33,716
That's your choice.

1037
01:10:34,508 --> 01:10:36,683
Don't fool yourself
with grand ideas of love.

1038
01:10:37,330 --> 01:10:40,549
And most importantly,
don't mistake love for lust.

1039
01:10:41,786 --> 01:10:42,924
Come here.

1040
01:10:44,977 --> 01:10:47,396
The day will come when
you will realize all of this.

1041
01:13:16,253 --> 01:13:17,337
Where's Robbie?

1042
01:13:18,297 --> 01:13:20,257
We were too late
to the hospital.

1043
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:27,347
The doctors tried everything,
but it was hopeless.

1044
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:31,316
What happened?
Last night he was just fine.

1045
01:13:32,065 --> 01:13:35,860
If he was feeling something unusual,
he didn't say anything about it.

1046
01:13:37,145 --> 01:13:38,230
Well, where is he?

1047
01:13:38,650 --> 01:13:39,276
Ma'am.

1048
01:13:39,693 --> 01:13:41,195
I need to see him!

1049
01:13:41,236 --> 01:13:42,110
That's not possible.

1050
01:13:42,135 --> 01:13:43,136
Why not?

1051
01:13:43,217 --> 01:13:45,219
Do you want to smear his name?

1052
01:13:45,751 --> 01:13:47,294
Also, have a little respect.

1053
01:13:47,618 --> 01:13:48,677
Respect?

1054
01:13:48,702 --> 01:13:50,063
Yes. For Ma'am Ginny.

1055
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:51,209
What about me?

1056
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:52,912
Ma'am Ginny is his wife.

1057
01:13:56,084 --> 01:13:57,127
Then what am I?

1058
01:13:59,046 --> 01:14:00,255
You already know
the answer to that.

1059
01:14:05,344 --> 01:14:10,823
Ma'am. I'll come back
for you tomorrow.

1060
01:14:10,848 --> 01:14:12,348
Just pack your things.

1061
01:14:12,775 --> 01:14:15,434
Ma'am Ginny might
know that you're here.

1062
01:14:16,049 --> 01:14:17,562
I'm just tying up
every loose end.

1063
01:14:39,294 --> 01:14:40,337
Ma'am!

1064
01:14:42,272 --> 01:14:44,316
I'm going to bring a
co-worker tomorrow

1065
01:14:44,341 --> 01:14:46,257
to help fetch you.

1066
01:14:49,879 --> 01:14:51,345
I'll be going now.

1067
01:15:05,154 --> 01:15:06,238
Where's Manong Dado?

1068
01:15:06,321 --> 01:15:09,783
I don't know. I think he
and Pao went to town.

1069
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:13,242
Where's your brother?

1070
01:15:13,954 --> 01:15:14,955
Asleep.

1071
01:15:15,289 --> 01:15:17,833
Looks like he drained
all his energy last night.

1072
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,209
Why?

1073
01:15:19,209 --> 01:15:20,836
Ask him yourself.

1074
01:15:23,213 --> 01:15:24,214
They're here.

1075
01:15:25,736 --> 01:15:27,571
Hey! Where are you?

1076
01:15:27,596 --> 01:15:28,639
What's up?

1077
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:29,720
Oh, you're there.

1078
01:15:30,846 --> 01:15:32,345
We still went out
early, you know.

1079
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:36,807
There were just too many people
in the market. Right, Manong?

1080
01:15:37,227 --> 01:15:39,146
You can't blame them
with the news going about.

1081
01:15:39,646 --> 01:15:41,690
Something happened
in the Cerrudo house.

1082
01:15:41,732 --> 01:15:43,525
What happened, Manong?

1083
01:15:43,984 --> 01:15:46,612
Someone who was
living next door died.

1084
01:15:47,738 --> 01:15:48,697
Who?

1085
01:15:48,739 --> 01:15:49,781
Robbie.

1086
01:15:50,407 --> 01:15:51,864
The Congressman's son.

1087
01:15:52,367 --> 01:15:55,120
The boyfriend of the woman
you were jacking off to.

1088
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,165
He died there?

1089
01:15:58,749 --> 01:16:00,334
Heart attack.

1090
01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:03,281
Shit. I'm jealous.

1091
01:16:03,317 --> 01:16:04,062
Why?

1092
01:16:04,087 --> 01:16:06,214
She's too good, you know?
Really deadly.

1093
01:16:06,757 --> 01:16:07,758
You're an asshole.

1094
01:16:08,175 --> 01:16:11,178
What do you think she
did that killed the guy?

1095
01:16:12,221 --> 01:16:13,221
You know what I think?

1096
01:16:14,091 --> 01:16:15,426
She sat on his face.

1097
01:16:15,451 --> 01:16:16,931
Dude!

1098
01:16:18,143 --> 01:16:18,810
Dude.

1099
01:16:19,019 --> 01:16:21,021
As in literally in the house?
At the resthouse?

1100
01:16:21,355 --> 01:16:22,356
I don't know.

1101
01:16:22,606 --> 01:16:26,068
Look, there's going to be a lot
of people here if he died there.

1102
01:16:26,777 --> 01:16:28,278
Wait a minute, why
are you so affected?

1103
01:16:28,737 --> 01:16:30,697
Is it because of
your hot friend?

1104
01:16:31,782 --> 01:16:33,784
Martin. Just behave.

1105
01:16:34,076 --> 01:16:36,036
Don't even think about
involving yourself in their mess.

1106
01:16:36,536 --> 01:16:37,537
Behave.

1107
01:16:38,038 --> 01:16:38,997
She's right.

1108
01:16:39,623 --> 01:16:43,321
Also, they might think
that you killed the guy

1109
01:16:43,418 --> 01:16:45,379
so you could take
the girl for yourself.

1110
01:16:45,954 --> 01:16:47,872
Or you sat on the guy's face.

1111
01:16:50,634 --> 01:16:52,678
They might check us.
I still have weed on me.

1112
01:17:25,949 --> 01:17:26,950
Adele.

1113
01:17:27,276 --> 01:17:28,650
I heard about what happened.

1114
01:17:49,317 --> 01:17:50,444
Is it true?

1115
01:17:54,614 --> 01:17:55,615
Are you okay?

1116
01:17:58,618 --> 01:17:59,661
Where is he?

1117
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:01,538
They took him away.

1118
01:18:02,706 --> 01:18:04,750
They didn't even let me see him.

1119
01:18:06,376 --> 01:18:07,711
He's not coming back.

1120
01:18:08,170 --> 01:18:09,588
What am I gonna do?

1121
01:18:12,716 --> 01:18:14,801
He told me he's going
to make it up to me.

1122
01:18:15,427 --> 01:18:16,884
What can he do now?

1123
01:18:19,431 --> 01:18:20,557
It's going to be okay.

1124
01:24:34,643 --> 01:24:36,413
Maybe they're looking for you.

1125
01:24:36,982 --> 01:24:38,066
I'm fine.

1126
01:24:38,992 --> 01:24:40,539
Why don't you go
home for a while?

1127
01:24:40,745 --> 01:24:41,746
How about you?

1128
01:24:44,325 --> 01:24:45,695
I'm okay.

1129
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:49,084
Are you sure you're
okay here by yourself?

1130
01:24:49,529 --> 01:24:52,490
I'm used to it. Just
go home for now.

1131
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:56,461
Thank you, Martin.

1132
01:24:57,537 --> 01:24:59,539
Thank you? For what?

1133
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,167
Nothing.

1134
01:25:37,035 --> 01:25:38,036
Damn.

1135
01:25:38,578 --> 01:25:40,622
Where have you been?

1136
01:25:40,997 --> 01:25:42,373
You visited the house
next door again, didn't you?

1137
01:25:43,374 --> 01:25:45,835
Martin. Be careful
around that woman, okay?

1138
01:25:46,044 --> 01:25:48,004
Her pussy is deadly!

1139
01:25:49,047 --> 01:25:52,383
Look at you, you're too thin. Your
heart might not be able to handle her.

1140
01:25:52,408 --> 01:25:54,369
You're going to break down.

1141
01:25:55,085 --> 01:25:57,046
It's coming, it's coming!

1142
01:25:58,306 --> 01:26:00,225
This fucking...

1143
01:26:02,143 --> 01:26:05,188
I will never forget
those few days that

1144
01:26:05,230 --> 01:26:07,273
we spent during our
vacation in Sto. Tomas.

1145
01:26:07,638 --> 01:26:11,148
Where I met the woman
who lived next door.

1146
01:26:12,946 --> 01:26:18,404
When I went back to see
Adele, the house was closed.

1147
01:26:18,841 --> 01:26:21,489
There was no one inside anymore.

1148
01:26:22,551 --> 01:26:23,732
Adele?

1149
01:26:29,921 --> 01:26:31,089
Adele!

1150
01:26:33,355 --> 01:26:35,274
Grab the things in the kitchen.

1151
01:26:35,299 --> 01:26:36,258
Okay, Sir.

1152
01:26:40,139 --> 01:26:41,266
Adele?

1153
01:26:42,976 --> 01:26:44,018
Adele!

1154
01:26:48,648 --> 01:26:49,691
Adele!

1155
01:26:56,155 --> 01:26:57,198
Adele?

1156
01:27:01,607 --> 01:27:02,745
Adele?

1157
01:27:08,710 --> 01:27:09,669
Adele?

1158
01:27:09,694 --> 01:27:13,615
I don't know when,
or how Adele left.

1159
01:27:15,008 --> 01:27:17,594
I don't know who fetched her,

1160
01:27:17,619 --> 01:27:20,135
or drove her to wherever
she might have went.

1161
01:27:22,807 --> 01:27:25,810
All I know is, that
ever since that day,

1162
01:27:26,153 --> 01:27:34,870
I never forgot about the woman who taught
to me what it truly means to be a man.

1163
01:27:35,069 --> 01:27:39,148
And sometimes,
still remember Adele.

1164
01:27:39,173 --> 01:27:42,176
Because she will never
be erased from my heart.

1165
01:27:42,201 --> 01:27:46,581
Martin! What's the matter?
We were looking for you.

1166
01:27:46,606 --> 01:27:48,483
Come on, we're leaving.
