1
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,000
Yaoyao.

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,480
You should think about the issue
in this way.

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,880
It used to be gunfire in the past,

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,480
but now,

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,200
it's basically done by injection.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
One shot is enough

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,840
to stop everything

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,680
and bring you peace.

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,800
Do you know what it's called?

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,760
Life

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,200
is good.

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,160
But this brings us back to the point.

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,000
What do people pursue

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,880
in their lifetime?

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,480
Pleasure.

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,960
Exactly.

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,640
Dopamine.

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,560
Good food can give you 70 percent.

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,320
Sex

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,040
gives you 100.

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,480
Ice

22
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,040
gives you 500

23
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,800
or even 1,000.

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,840
Let me tell you.

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,400
They
won't be able to imagine such happiness.

26
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,480
Why don't you take it, then?

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,400
I have a different responsibility.

28
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,360
I am the spreader of happiness,

29
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,400
not a consumer.

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,560
Even you, the fourth-in-command,

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,560
dare to resume the old business.

32
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,240
Are the Northwest Wolves

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,160
making a comeback?

34
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,920
Let's not talk about that.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,200
Northwest Wolves

36
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,280
no longer exist.

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,000
After 2014,

38
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,040
some of us

39
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,600
have formed a deep bond.

40
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
To be honest with you,

41
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,440
throughout the five years in hiding,

42
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,200
I only did one thing.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,920
I observed.

44
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,520
I observed three people.

45
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,840
First,

46
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,360
the eldest one, Mr. Gu.

47
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,240
To this day,
I don't know if he's dead or alive.

48
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,240
I can't even

49
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,720
find a place to burn joss paper for him.

50
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:10,880
The second one

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,400
is the third in line, Gun.

52
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,552
Because of my hatred toward him,

53
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,040
I will never

54
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,360
forgive him in this lifetime.

55
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,800
I want to kill him,

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,880
but

57
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,080
after he was kicked out,

58
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,800
he disappeared without a trace.

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,280
He's an expert in hiding.

60
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,480
The other one

61
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,400
is Seventh Sister,

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,080
Ms. Lin.

63
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,760
I found her son.

64
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,480
He's quite a guy.

65
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,840
Big build.

66
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,560
A six-footer.

67
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,320
A spirited guy.

68
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,480
I think

69
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,760
he doesn't resemble his dad.

70
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,240
He resembles me.

71
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,200
Unfortunately,

72
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,080
he's now working for the government,

73
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,280
so I can't afford to mess with him.

74
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,320
I've been working in vain
for the past five years.

75
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,200
I'm really at a loss now.

76
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,440
All I can do
is sell my products on the street.

77
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,960
So, I came to ask for your help,

78
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,800
Yaoyao.

79
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,160
Pei.

80
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,280
Let me tell you honestly.

81
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,000
I came today

82
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,600
to see you.

83
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,280
My husband told me
that we won't get involved in drugs

84
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,200
for now.

85
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
What's the reason?

86
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,480
The biggest drug lord in the South Sea

87
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,720
who had decades-old assets

88
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,720
was ruined by someone
called Gan Tianlei.

89
00:03:56,352 --> 00:03:58,560
Who knows if there's anyone
with the surname "Gan" in Hexi?

90
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,240
I've heard about this.

91
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,560
I heard

92
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,880
that the one called Cherry
hasn't been sentenced yet.

93
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,080
Therefore,

94
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,720
we can still

95
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,360
be friends.

96
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,200
But let's save business

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,760
for later.

98
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,480
Yaoyao.

99
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,520
Do you know

100
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,600
what is the most precious thing in life?

101
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,200
It's time, isn't it?

102
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,640
So tell me,

103
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,040
why are you wasting my time?

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,240
Such is the harsh reality of life.

105
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,280
I'm sorry, Yin!

106
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,440
Yin!

107
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,760
Let's talk, Yin!

108
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,960
Don't kill me!

109
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,480
Spare me, please!

110
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,080
Yin!

111
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,840
Kid.

112
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,320
Want to have a glass?

113
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,920
Our first glass

114
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,280
is free.

115
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,320
=Chase the Truth=

116
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,140
(Adapted from Zhao Junkai's novel
"Northwest Off-North is Not North")

117
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,480
=Episode 12=

118
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,048
Open the door. Is there anyone outside?

119
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,160
Is it blocked?

120
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,280
Hold this.

121
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,160
Ji.

122
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,680
Where's Long Qi?

123
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,760
I locked them in the old kitchen.

124
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,320
Nana is in there too.

125
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,320
Nana?

126
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,240
Yes.

127
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:18,720
It was Nana who brought him in.

128
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,040
I couldn't hear exactly

129
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,048
what they talked about.

130
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,360
I've locked the door.

131
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,400
Right now, they are still inside.

132
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,560
Chief Tai.

133
00:07:30,592 --> 00:07:32,304
someone is
raiding Liujia Bay cave-dwelling.

134
00:07:32,496 --> 00:07:33,960
They're going to take the people away.

135
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,624
Do we follow?

136
00:07:34,944 --> 00:07:36,320
Send me the license plate number

137
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,040
and be on standby.

138
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,120
Yes, sir.

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,520
Hello?

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,896
Did you get the stuff?

141
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,880
(Got it.)

142
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:50,920
(It's a gun)

143
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,160
that uses 6mm plastic bullets.

144
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,840
(Mr. Ji.)

145
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,960
(You have an interesting sense
of humor.)

146
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,400
Why?

147
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,160
Is the cave-dwelling fake?

148
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,440
(The cave-dwelling exists,)

149
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,760
(but the item is fake.)

150
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,840
I have an old security with me.

151
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,880
Do you want him?

152
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,760
There's nothing in the cave.

153
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,480
We've been tricked by Long Qi.

154
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,160
Long Qi didn't take a single penny
from you.

155
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,480
What does he want?

156
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,000
Are you suggesting
that Long Qi is acting

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,040
on behalf of Gun?

158
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,680
I'm not sure.

159
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,760
The police are starting
to investigate me.

160
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,336
Is the natural gas pipeline
still in the old kitchen?

161
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,280
Yes.

162
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,920
Control the concentration.

163
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,720
Time it well.

164
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,400
Five minutes later, rescue Nana.

165
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,360
What about Long Qi?

166
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,520
After he dies,

167
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,040
find a place to burn him.

168
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,240
Remember.

169
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,536
Make sure he dies thoroughly.

170
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,840
(Fake police?)

171
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,240
Yes.

172
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,800
The car was sprayed with fresh paint.

173
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,800
The license plate is also fake.

174
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,720
I've called the local police station

175
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,240
and the district team near Liujia Bay.

176
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,360
They told me that they
didn't dispatch any forces

177
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,760
tonight.

178
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,240
Besides,

179
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,416
they didn't receive any reports
from the public tonight.

180
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,080
Gun wouldn't act in his own play,

181
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,136
and he's not on our side either.

182
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,520
(It must be Zhou Ji, then.)

183
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,040
(He's doing this)

184
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,920
(to break ties with Gun.)

185
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,760
Let me answer a call.

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,480
(Chief Tai.)

187
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,344
I'm in the cave-dwelling with Liu.

188
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,720
There's nothing here except corn.

189
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:45,840
(They stayed in the cave-dwelling
for 14 minutes.)

190
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,960
(When they left, they didn't)

191
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,160
(take any large items with them.)

192
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,960
Continue monitoring

193
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,984
and be on standby.

194
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,040
(Yes, sir.)

195
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,920
The warehouse is in trouble.

196
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,840
Zhou Ji won't let Yihan go.

197
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,312
Let's end the call here.

198
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,160
Hello, Master.

199
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,080
(Cheng Fan.)

200
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,960
(Hurry and locate Yihan.)

201
00:10:13,024 --> 00:10:14,640
Tell him
that the mission is accomplished.

202
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,520
He must leave now.

203
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,640
Why?

204
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,720
Do as I say.

205
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,800
(Yes, sir.)

206
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,360
Ku.

207
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Ji.

208
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,160
Anyone there?

209
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,096
Who are you calling?

210
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,800
Ji?

211
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,120
Sorry.

212
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,000
I heard he was going to hurt you
so I came to find you.

213
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,760
What's that smell?

214
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,000
How is it?

215
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,520
Master.

216
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,560
Yihan.

217
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,160
Isn't that man behind Yihan

218
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,240
Zhou Ji's bodyguard?

219
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,800
Zoom in. See what he's up to.

220
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,616
He seems to be locking the door.

221
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,440
Go.

222
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,640
Inform Yihan

223
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,848
mission accomplished.

224
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,240
Yes, sir.

225
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,000
You guys stay here.

226
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,200
I'll take a look.

227
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:16,880
Alright.

228
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,040
Cover up your mouth.

229
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,600
Gu Linna.

230
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,200
Don't sleep.

231
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,440
Gu Linna.

232
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,200
Long Qi.

233
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
I'm sorry.

234
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
You helped me,

235
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,520
but I hurt you.

236
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
It's been so long

237
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,800
since I last saw my dad.

238
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,600
I

239
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,040
have never wanted to hurt anyone.

240
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Please

241
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,560
trust me.

242
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,560
I believe you.

243
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,360
I believe you.

244
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,480
Come on.

245
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,600
Don't sleep. Hang in there.

246
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,960
You can call me Nana.

247
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,400
Long Qi.

248
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,760
I want to

249
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,560
be friends with you.

250
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,600
Can I know your real name?

251
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,480
Wake up.

252
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,680
Gu Linna.

253
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,000
Nana.

254
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,440
It's Chu Yihan.

255
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,520
Wake up, Nana.

256
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,840
Hang in there.

257
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,320
Qiao Dan.

258
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,400
Don't be impatient.

259
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,120
Hello.

260
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,920
Captain. We have a problem.

261
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,080
Open the door, boss.

262
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,600
Come in.

263
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,800
Wear this and leave.

264
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,240
Where's Long Qi?

265
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,080
Zhou Ji has taken action against him.

266
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,880
He led him into a room
and locked the door.

267
00:16:38,896 --> 00:16:40,560
Gas is currently released in the room.

268
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,720
It's pretty pungent in there.

269
00:16:41,824 --> 00:16:43,920
Anyone inside the room
won't hold on for long.

270
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,840
That means

271
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,872
he's not on Gu Mulan's team.

272
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,440
Wait, no.

273
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,920
He's a police.

274
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,440
Police?

275
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,240
Shouldn't we leave now, then?

276
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,600
Where's Gu Mulan's daughter?

277
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,760
She's with Long Qi.

278
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,640
They are inhaling gas.

279
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,960
That room is filled with gas.

280
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,888
Do you want to save her?
It's dangerous in there.

281
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,080
No way.

282
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,360
We must take her away.

283
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,440
What about Fei?

284
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,200
Don't bother him.

285
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,200
(Qiao Dan, quick.)

286
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,360
(Save them.)

287
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,080
Get him out.

288
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,960
Yes, sir.

289
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,080
Qiao Dan.

290
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,568
Call me for any issues.

291
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,080
Come on.

292
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,880
Captain Xia.

293
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,560
Dispatch officers to Blue Sky Hotel!

294
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,280
Backup needed.

295
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,000
Ku. Wake up, Ku.

296
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,880
Wake up.

297
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,840
Luckily,

298
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,344
the guy on duty tonight is a pushover.

299
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,520
If he hadn't told me about the back door,

300
00:19:03,568 --> 00:19:04,480
it would've been hard

301
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,200
for us to break this lock.

302
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,240
Hello.

303
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,200
(Boss.)

304
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,640
(This is bad.)

305
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,640
(Miss Linna...)

306
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,120
(Miss Linna...)

307
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,440
(was kidnapped.)

308
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,200
Hurry up and find them.

309
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,840
What happened?

310
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,520
That's the situation.

311
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,616
How long until you arrive?

312
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,680
At most 20 minutes.

313
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:17,640
Alright.

314
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,760
Who is it?

315
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,600
Officer Cheng, I'm Zhou Ji.

316
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,960
I have an urgent matter.

317
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,424
Officer Cheng.

318
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,120
I want to report a crime.

319
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,720
A gun dealer named Sha Fei

320
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,240
and a wanted criminal, Li Tianlong,

321
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,832
took hostage of my sister-in-law.

322
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,040
Do you know Sha Fei?

323
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,200
It's a long story.

324
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,200
This flash drive

325
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,600
contains all the evidence

326
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,160
of their coercion and abuse.

327
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,600
I'll explain in detail later.

328
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,000
The situation is urgent now.

329
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,520
Please hurry to rescue her.

330
00:21:58,576 --> 00:22:00,840
I've reported this to Captain Xia
of Public Security Bureau,

331
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,120
but he's too far away.

332
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,720
I can only seek your help.

333
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,400
Boss.

334
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,440
A guy named Ji calls.

335
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,720
(Gun.)

336
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,760
(Why leave without saying goodbye?)

337
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,320
You really don't mind
handing Fei over to the police?

338
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,760
(How did the negotiation go?)

339
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,560
Fei is too impatient.

340
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,600
He said some unpleasant things.

341
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,656
The negotiation fell apart.

342
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,360
Gun.

343
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,600
For the sake of Fei,

344
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,760
I advise you to consider it again.

345
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,000
Is that pile of scrap metal

346
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,360
more important than your son?

347
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,160
(Zhou Ji.)

348
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,040
If you want to target Fei,

349
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,000
go ahead.

350
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,640
(Gun)
Fei.

351
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,560
Do you believe the Liujia Bay story now?

352
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,360
Captain Xia.

353
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,024
Pull over for a moment.

354
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
I'll go take a look.

355
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,280
Alright.

356
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,080
Boss, the police are after us.

357
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,040
Stop them.

358
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,480
Hey.

359
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,640
Block the police car.

360
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,000
Where do you think they went?

361
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,320
I don't know.

362
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,080
He's abandoning you,

363
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,160
and you're still protecting him.

364
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,640
Is it true

365
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,200
about Lu Wentian?

366
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,280
You can ask Mr. Jin
if you don't believe me.

367
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,160
Stay here.

368
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,000
Don't go upstairs.

369
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,752
Go upstairs.

370
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,720
Police.

371
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,360
Long Qi, are you okay?

372
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,320
I'm fine.

373
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,000
Does it hurt?

374
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,040
Why do you
have to follow your mother's path

375
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,000
and walk towards a dead end?

376
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,760
Can you save him?

377
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,360
He's bleeding.

378
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,000
Nana.

379
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,880
Do you know

380
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,400
your father
is the former Northwest Wolf King?

381
00:28:27,648 --> 00:28:29,480
He's the biggest cancer
in the entire Northwest.

382
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,960
He didn't go abroad for business

383
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,480
but to evade the police.

384
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,000
And he is a cop.

385
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,080
He's here to arrest me and your father.

386
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,160
Do you understand?

387
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,200
This person is here to take our lives.

388
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,000
Bing.

389
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,800
Go refuel the car.

390
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,960
Please save him.

391
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,400
He'll die.

392
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,680
How did my mom die?

393
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,080
To be honest, I don't know.

394
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,400
She was impressive though.

395
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,800
I only figured out she was a cop

396
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,320
when you revealed your identity.

397
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,240
You fall way short

398
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,320
compared to your mother.

399
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,200
Kid.

400
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,040
Come here.

401
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,760
Would you like

402
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,240
another free drink today?

403
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,000
Great.

404
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,000
Have a seat.

405
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,700
(Surveillance room)

406
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,240
Duan.

407
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:56,720
Hey.

408
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,680
- Officer Cheng.
- Captain Xia.

409
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,040
We eat irregularly,

410
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,000
so keep some.

411
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,008
Keep your blood sugar up.

412
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,960
About the half cup of water
I asked you to test,

413
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,960
has the result come out?

414
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,920
Yes, it's out.

415
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,680
It's just ordinary Apocynum tea.
Nothing wrong with it.

416
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,120
It seems he just wanted to
gain some insight into our defense.

417
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,280
There's no sign
of the target's vehicle yet.

418
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,920
Land occupancy is only 23 percent

419
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,080
in the entire Kalisha.

420
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,360
It's all desert
once you're out of the city.

421
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,400
Those are areas
beyond the network's reach.

422
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,760
It's precisely for this reason
many criminals like to operate here.

423
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,160
Hello?

424
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,920
(Hello, Chief Tai.)

425
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,240
(I'd like to file a report.)

426
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,440
I know you're looking for Gun.

427
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,440
I saw his men kidnapping a girl
with my own eyes.

428
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,800
I know where he is.

429
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,680
I'll send the address to your phone.

430
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
Please check it.

431
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,600
Who are you?

432
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
What's your name?

433
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,240
I'm Gu Mulan.

434
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,760
Aren't you looking for me?

435
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
No need to look further.

436
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,200
I'm here to help you catch him.

437
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,640
Who else is with you?

438
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,440
Bye, Chief Tai.

439
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,280
This is a child's phone.

440
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,080
Don't bother looking for it.

441
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,440
The most dangerous place is the safest.

442
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,720
(He hasn't gone far.)

443
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,000
(Hurry and catch him.)

444
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,400
(If you're late,
you'll lose everything.)

445
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,080
Well done.

446
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,600
Here.

447
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,040
Cheers.

448
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,400
(Wolf Hut, 15 km north
of Seven Wolves Mountain)

449
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,520
Track the number that just called.

450
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,360
(Understood.)

451
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,040
Duan Qing.

452
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,040
(Chief Tai.)

453
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,560
Ask them

454
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,640
whether there's a Seven Wolves Mountain
in Kalisha.

455
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:55,920
Captain Xia.

456
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,128
Is there a mountain here
called Seven Wolves Mountain?

457
00:31:58,128 --> 00:31:59,000
Seven Wolves Mountain?

458
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,960
It's not far,
about 40 kilometers from here.

459
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,096
Chief Tai.

460
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:02,720
There is.

461
00:32:03,216 --> 00:32:04,480
Someone reported Gun is hiding

462
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,832
in the Wolf Hut 15 kilometers
north of Seven Wolves Mountain.

463
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,360
Take your people

464
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,792
and check it out now.

465
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,160
Yes, sir.

466
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,208
To Seven Wolves Mountain.

467
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,080
Let's go.

468
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,480
Yiyi.

469
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,680
Go out first.

470
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,440
You go out first.

471
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,480
This place isn't bad.

472
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,600
If Yiyi hadn't told me,

473
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,600
I wouldn't have known we own this place.

474
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,560
I was nearly killed by Zhou Ji

475
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,200
and arrested by the police.

476
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,080
Dad.

477
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,400
Aren't you worried at all?

478
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,440
It's not safe here.

479
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,680
Take Yiyi with you

480
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,800
and go.

481
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,000
Go where?

482
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,040
Isn't this place fine?

483
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,720
This is where you store your samples.

484
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,280
Let's talk outside.

485
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,960
I want to ask about Lu Wentian.

486
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,440
Mr. Lu

487
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,000
has been dead for a long time.

488
00:34:16,336 --> 00:34:18,208
Why have I heard another version
of that story?

489
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,600
Why don't you

490
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,080
tell it to me one more time?

491
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,880
Do you dare?

492
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,880
(Gun.)

493
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,040
Why don't I tell the story for you?

494
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,000
Zhou Ji.

495
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,960
You better not talk nonsense.

496
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,200
Let him tell it.

497
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,880
I want to hear it.

498
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:52,960
(Gun.)

499
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,640
(Pardon me for this.)

500
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,400
It was 1995, right?

501
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,960
There was a gun smuggler
whose name was Lu Wentian.

502
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,400
(In the Xuanwu District of Hanbei,)

503
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,040
(about 40 km to the east,)

504
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,160
(he injured someone with a gun.)

505
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,480
(He was pursued by the police.)

506
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,240
(Finally, he ran to Liujia Bay.)

507
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,360
(Back then in Liujia Bay,)

508
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,840
(there was a family)

509
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,840
(where the mom died young)

510
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,600
(while the dad was a single father)

511
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,280
(with a one-year-old child.)

512
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,320
(They relied on their corn farm)

513
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,800
(to earn a living.)

514
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,400
(Lu Wentian)

515
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,560
paid the dad 1,000,

516
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,400
so he could hide in their home

517
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,800
to avoid the searching police force.

518
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,160
(He dodged a bullet,)

519
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,080
(but he knew that life on the run)

520
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,840
(is not an easy one.)

521
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,240
(Hence,)

522
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,000
(he bit the hand that fed him.)

523
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,360
(It must have been 9 December.)

524
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,840
(Lu Wentian)

525
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,760
(killed the man who saved him)

526
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,600
(and made it look like
it was the suicide of a guilty man.)

527
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,920
(On the police's second sweep,)

528
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,360
(they were misled by his ruse.)

529
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,760
(They thought the dead man)

530
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,360
(was their wanted man.)

531
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,160
(Thus,)

532
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,440
(the case)

533
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,240
(was closed.)

534
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,080
(Due to that,)

535
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,000
(Lu Wentian)

536
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,360
dodged another bullet.

537
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,880
He raised the one-year-old orphan

538
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,080
and lived using the farmer's name

539
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,240
until this day.

540
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,680
(That's right.)

541
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,160
(The farmer's name was)

542
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,440
(Sha Fei.)

543
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,080
(Poor boy.)

544
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,200
(For over 20 years,)

545
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,000
(the boy thought of the man as his dad.)

546
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,760
(He did not know)

547
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,640
(that the dad he spent years with)

548
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,600
(was the scoundrel who killed his dad.)

549
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,680
Fei.

550
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,280
Trivial trickery

551
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,000
shouldn't sway your judgment.

552
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,160
Why then,

553
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,080
on the 9th day of the 12th lunar month
every year,

554
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,496
do you insist on bringing me
to Liujia Bay

555
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,480
to pray to Mr. Lu?

556
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,160
Fei.

557
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,000
I've sent you the real photo

558
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,160
of Sha Fei.

559
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,960
(Take a look.)

560
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,960
Tell me

561
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,640
he's not making this up.

562
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,000
My son.

563
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,440
For years,

564
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,400
I have treated you well.

565
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,880
My conscience is clear.

566
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,360
Lu Wentian.

567
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,600
I'm not your son.

568
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,800
(Gun.)

569
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,440
(You should know)

570
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:11,800
that patricide

571
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,520
is not a myth.

572
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,920
If you want revenge

573
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,200
because you believe him,

574
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,000
I won't fight back.

575
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,680
Killing me

576
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,960
is not the logical choice though.

577
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:41,040
Why would I avenge a man I never knew?

578
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,560
He's dead. How is that my business?

579
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,000
Lu Wentian.

580
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,640
If not for you,

581
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,200
I might have a normal life.

582
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,040
I could walk out in the open.

583
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,360
I could sleep with a pillow,

584
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,800
instead of a gun.

585
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,960
I could go to school

586
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,280
and get married.

587
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,360
You ruined my life.

588
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,360
You owe me compensation.

589
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,200
I left a document in the restaurant.

590
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,600
It'll prove

591
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,560
that I forced you into this since young.

592
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,288
You had no choice

593
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,000
but to walk on this path.

594
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,640
You're a victim.

595
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,200
Everything you did

596
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,760
was done under my orders.

597
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,480
Now,

598
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,520
you can tie me up.

599
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,880
Hand me to the police,

600
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,560
and you can lead a new life.

601
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,320
I don't need that.

602
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,160
Since I can't be a good guy,

603
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,280
I should see this through to the end.

604
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,480
I'll be stronger than you.

605
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,280
You shouldn't do this.

606
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,400
I will be Gun,

607
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,520
the one and only Gun

608
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,880
in this world.

609
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,880
Where's the main warehouse?

610
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,440
I will never tell you

611
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,760
where it's located.

612
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,760
Fei.

613
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,160
Once you open Pandora's box,

614
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,800
you can never go back.

615
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,400
Where is the warehouse?

616
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,080
Not everyone

617
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,800
is capable and lucky enough

618
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,520
to have this wealth.

619
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,920
Tie me up and hand me to the police.

620
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,280
You won't kill me.

621
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,360
I don't even care about my real dad.

622
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,400
Why would I care about you?

623
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,200
Fei, there are a lot of cars approaching.

624
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,000
Jin never returned.

625
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,880
The police have arrived.

626
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,200
Fei.

627
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,800
Underneath the Wolf Hut,

628
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,840
I buried one sixth of my backup samples.

629
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,600
It's enough to flatten this place.

630
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,840
Let's drag the police

631
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,120
down to hell with us,

632
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,160
okay?

633
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,640
If you don't want to die,

634
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,000
you'll scram.

635
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,040
Get lost!

636
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,520
Fei.

637
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,640
Let's go.

638
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,040
What are you doing?

639
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,160
(Gun.)

640
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,760
(The police must be close by.)

641
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,240
How did you know I'm here?

642
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,680
I know you better than yourself.

643
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,920
Where Fei would go,

644
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,840
I know as well as you do.

645
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,120
(How about this?)

646
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,040
(Let Seven's son go,)

647
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,840
(and I won't trouble Fei.)

648
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,280
Why do you want Seven's son?

649
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,200
(It's none of your business.)

650
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,480
It's one-for-one.

651
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,240
You lose nothing.

652
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,960
Did you think

653
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,320
I'd care about a brat?

654
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,160
You're different now.

655
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,560
5 years ago, you would abandon him

656
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,880
while you escaped.

657
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,880
However, now,

658
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,240
you can't escape.

659
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,800
Fei is your only hope.

660
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,400
If he dies,

661
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,440
Gun will not exist anymore.

662
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,880
Think carefully.

663
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,040
Pei Yin.

664
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,600
Do you think that's an actual threat?

665
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,840
You're not strong enough.

666
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,960
As a spy,

667
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,920
frustration

668
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,800
and guilt

669
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,760
are normal emotions.

670
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,680
Who do you think you are now?

671
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,000
You are caught in an identity crisis,

672
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,280
but your mom was lost in it.

673
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,640
Hence, in your mind,

674
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,040
who is she?

675
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,840
In her mind,

676
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,440
who is she?

677
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,136
Multiple psychological disorders

678
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:28,160
would result in a higher risk of suicide.

679
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,480
Do you have such ideations too?

680
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Today,

681
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,400
your wish will come true.

682
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,480
As a fellow patient,

683
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,000
I will stay with you

684
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,760
and die with you.

685
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,880
Don't come any closer!

686
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:18,960
Stop the car!

687
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,000
Stop the car!

688
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,200
Stop the car!

689
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,440
Don't come any closer!

690
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,440
