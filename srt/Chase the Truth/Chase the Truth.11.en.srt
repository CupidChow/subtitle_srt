(13 years ago)

2
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:21,920
Master.

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,920
It should be their people.

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,840
But

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,920
I don't know if Gu Mulan is here.

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,856
You're really good at this, Nana.

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,424
Did your uncle teach you?

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:39,960
Yes.

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,160
Nana.

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,160
Do you know how to write Mulan?

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,040
Is it the Mulan of Hua Mulan?

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,040
(Mulan)
Sort of.

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,120
(Mulan)
Write it for me to see.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:49,760
Boss.

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,160
What is it?

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,600
Gun has something to discuss with you.

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,960
Honey.

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,440
Did something happen?

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,640
Today is my daughter's birthday.

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,200
That's the biggest event.

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,000
Come on. Let's cut the cake.

25
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,280
Dad.

26
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,040
Your dad is gone.

27
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,600
(What happened?)

28
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,080
How many warehouses do you have?

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,080
Where are they?

30
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,160
Who do you think you are?

31
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,120
Can you recall now?

32
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,160
Is killing me what Gu wants?

33
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,680
I was just playing with Fei.

34
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,160
You really took it seriously.

35
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,840
What do you want to do?

36
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,360
You're this old.

37
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,360
For the matter of meeting Mr. Gu,

38
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,040
let's have Fei handle it.

39
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,520
Okay?

40
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,880
Before he comes back,

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,240
give me your phone.

42
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,600
I'll keep it for you temporarily.

43
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
At the resort,

44
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,200
there's a landline.

45
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,480
If you want to find me,

46
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,720
press the number-one key.

47
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,000
I'll be there on call.

48
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,600
Give me your phone and gun.

49
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,040
Give him.

50
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,304
I don't have a phone.

51
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,000
Gun.

52
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,320
There's a big party tonight.

53
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,640
The annual Golden Lamb Festival

54
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,600
is right downstairs where you live.

55
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,600
Feel free to come and watch.

56
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,680
I see. Gu's reserved event.

57
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,536
You aren't worried
about attracting the police's attention?

58
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,520
It's open to the public now.

59
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,280
In the past,

60
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,800
the winning side

61
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,560
could get one percent
of the group's annual profit.

62
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,480
Now it's all about charity.

63
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,400
If someone wins,

64
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,360
the money will be donated in his name.

65
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,560
Of course.

66
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,880
If anyone urgently needs the money,

67
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,600
they can have it.

68
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,560
Tonight, Mr. Jiang

69
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,920
will roast a lamb himself.

70
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,504
Feel free to come and taste it.

71
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,080
Which Mr. Jiang?

72
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,840
My father-in-law,

73
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,400
Mr. Jiang Jiuping.

74
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:37,280
(Blue Sky Hotel)

75
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,000
Nana

76
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,560
is as considerate as you are.

77
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,840
She's a lot like you.

78
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,280
You raised her so well.

79
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,520
Does she

80
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,640
regard you

81
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,080
as her own father and mother
in her heart?

82
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,560
In 2006,

83
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,160
her mother helped me to the South Sea
to negotiate a fruit business deal.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The mountain road
was not easy to travel at night.

85
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,440
Around 2:30 a.m.,

86
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,440
perhaps due to fatigue,

87
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,840
the car overturned down the mountain.

88
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,640
Until now,
her mother's body hasn't been found.

89
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
Back then, Nana

90
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,000
was just six years old.

91
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,800
After that,

92
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,040
she has been with me ever since.

93
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,000
If her mother were still alive,

94
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,880
according to the lunar calendar,

95
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,520
today would have been her 45th birthday.

96
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,600
When did her mother pass away?

97
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,280
October.

98
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,040
It's been 15 years now.

99
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,360
What about her dad?

100
00:06:41,008 --> 00:06:42,600
A short-lived person
and a heartless man.

101
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,000
Just mentioning him
feels like it brings bad luck.

102
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,040
Let's not talk about him, then.

103
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,400
Officer Cheng.

104
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,000
To commemorate my sister,

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,600
I'll host a whole lamb feast tonight.

106
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,600
How about this?

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,640
You

108
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,440
invite Dr. Mu Xiaowan.

109
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,160
I'll invite Mr. Mu.

110
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,240
Let the dad and daughter

111
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,280
take this opportunity

112
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,680
to have a good meal.

113
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,392
What do you think?

114
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,400
Sure.

115
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,160
Then we'll

116
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,880
do as you say.

117
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,920
Thank you.

118
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,240
To be honest, Officer Cheng.

119
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,200
I hardly make friends
with a police officer.

120
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,080
So

121
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,520
I'd like to consult you
on some criminal matters.

122
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,680
Mr. Jiang, you should be careful.

123
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,440
I'm in charge of the Vice Squad.

124
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,320
You're here

125
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,920
running a hotel.

126
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,200
Be careful not to say anything wrong.

127
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,800
If I have any evidence,

128
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,200
I'll report it to you immediately.

129
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,440
Talking to you here,

130
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,512
I'm not afraid
of being accused of defamation.

131
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,720
I'm just concerned

132
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,440
about affecting family harmony.

133
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,960
Mr. Jiang.

134
00:07:56,432 --> 00:07:58,384
Are you going
to sacrifice your family for justice?

135
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,440
As a businessman,

136
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,368
abiding by the law and keeping one's word
are equally important.

137
00:08:04,736 --> 00:08:05,872
There should be no ambiguity.

138
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,584
I dare not leave any ambiguity either.

139
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,800
Officer Cheng.

140
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,160
If you're free tonight,

141
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,640
I'd like you to meet someone.

142
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:18,624
Whether they're on the dark side or not,
it's up to you.

143
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,120
Okay.

144
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,120
Hello?

145
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,360
(Mr. Long.)

146
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,160
(It's me.)

147
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,280
(Can we talk?)

148
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,720
I'm on your turf now.

149
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,360
Whatever you say goes.

150
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,280
(Thanks for the photos.)

151
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,720
No problem.

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,552
(I need to check if the cave-dwelling
is worth that price first)

153
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,920
(before I can pay you.)

154
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,120
(You do understand, right?)

155
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,040
This matter

156
00:09:02,656 --> 00:09:03,920
needs to be discussed in person.

157
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:07,120
(General Manager's Office)

158
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,480
Ji.

159
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,000
Sha Xiaofei doesn't know
there's a warehouse in Liujia Bay.

160
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,160
He mentioned a main warehouse

161
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,000
and knew the address.

162
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,280
I've sent someone to follow him.

163
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,120
If we can dig out something,

164
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,440
I won't need to negotiate with Gun.

165
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,080
You won't have to wait for my orders then.

166
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,640
Just kill him.

167
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,760
If we can't find it,

168
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,320
keep Sha Xiaofei alive.

169
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,480
I need him

170
00:09:32,512 --> 00:09:33,744
to help me negotiate with Gun.

171
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,760
Rest assured.

172
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,280
It's all arranged.

173
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,080
Sha Xiaofei will
send you a message tonight.

174
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,720
(I'm on your turf now.)

175
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,800
(What's the inconvenience?)

176
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,880
(Gun's warehouse is in Liujia Bay.)

177
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,840
(The photos and location)

178
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,520
(have already been sent to your phone.)

179
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,520
Is this the same person?

180
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,680
No, it's not.

181
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,760
The ripples don't match.

182
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,800
It's probably a disguise.

183
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,640
There must be something fishy going on.

184
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,360
Have you heard of Long Qi?

185
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,520
Yes.

186
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,240
I don't know
if this person is real or fake.

187
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,360
It's very troublesome.

188
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,800
Tonight, find a way

189
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,880
to control him separately.

190
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,392
Should I keep him alive?

191
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,080
If you can, yes.

192
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,840
If not, then forget it.

193
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,080
Nana.

194
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,520
I'm looking for Ji.

195
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,320
Nana.

196
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,520
Ji.

197
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,320
When can I call my dad?

198
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,480
In an hour,

199
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,960
your dad

200
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,480
will call this number.

201
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,080
Go back and wait.

202
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,840
Okay, I got it.

203
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,680
She has been acting strange lately.

204
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,840
Be more vigilant.

205
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,120
Okay.

206
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,280
The victim of Gun,

207
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,680
Hanbei's police officer, Cheng Fan.

208
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,960
Gun's godson, Zhang Yu,

209
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,840
was killed by him back then.

210
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,960
Did Jiang bring him here?

211
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,984
Not necessarily.

212
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,600
Both Gun

213
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,760
and Long Qi are here.

214
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,960
Suddenly, he appears.

215
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,840
It shouldn't be a coincidence.

216
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,440
You must be careful tonight.

217
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,880
Don't let Cheng Fan

218
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,760
run into Gun or Long Qi.

219
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,720
Ji.

220
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,480
How about

221
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,760
you avoid it too?

222
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,560
Don't confront the police head-on.

223
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,600
If Cheng Fan can come here now,

224
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,840
it means he has investigated me.

225
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,480
Moreover,

226
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,640
the Golden Lamb Festival
is an annual event.

227
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,680
If I don't attend,

228
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,960
it will make me more suspicious.

229
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,640
Also,

230
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,600
if I don't attend,

231
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,760
I won't be able to call the roll.

232
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,600
If I don't call the roll,
you won't qualify to go on stage.

233
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,400
If you can't go on stage, you won't
get the Golden Lamb prize money.

234
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,200
Then, the Black Cloak will
lose its source of income.

235
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,440
It's okay.

236
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,440
Don't worry about me.

237
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,960
I have a way to deal with Cheng Fan.

238
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,900
(Golden Lamb Festival)

239
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,400
The fire is lit.

240
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,160
Hello.

241
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,000
Move forward.

242
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,960
Come, sit here.

243
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,160
This is nice.

244
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,760
Look.

245
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,280
Hello?

246
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,080
(Is it Nana?)

247
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,480
(It's Dad.)

248
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,200
(Nana?)

249
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,000
(Hello?)

250
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,760
(Nana.)

251
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,800
Dad.

252
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,880
Um,

253
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,160
were you the one who cheered for me

254
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,720
in the small auditorium?

255
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,520
(Come on.)

256
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
Dad, where are you?

257
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,000
I miss you so much. I want to see you.

258
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,520
Can I have a video call with you?

259
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
Can I?

260
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,120
(Nana.)

261
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,520
(I miss you every day too.)

262
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,360
(I want to reunite with you.)

263
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,760
(I promise you.)

264
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,160
(Before the end of this year,)

265
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,200
(we'll reunite.)

266
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,280
Dad.

267
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,200
Are you Gu Mulan?

268
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,640
(Nana.)

269
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,560
(Gu Mulan is a big villain.)

270
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,280
(I didn't have time to be with you
in these years.)

271
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,280
(Did I become a big villain in your heart?)

272
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,680
Then, are you a police officer?

273
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,440
(Nana.)

274
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,120
(Don't think wildly.)

275
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,200
(It's the Golden Lamb Festival tonight.)

276
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,760
(It's your mom's birthday.)

277
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,440
(You must be happy.)

278
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,800
(Right?)

279
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,240
Dad.

280
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,600
I want to see you now.

281
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,280
(I'm sorry, Nana.)

282
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,480
(I'm in Moscow now.)

283
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,000
(I'm really busy.)

284
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,600
(After this busy period,)

285
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,960
(we can be together.)

286
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,240
(Take good care of yourself.)

287
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
(Be good.)

288
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,360
(I will be home as soon as possible.)

289
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,080
(To be honest, I miss you too.)

290
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,200
You should continue with your work.

291
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
(Goodbye, Nana.)

292
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,280
Goodbye, Dad.

293
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,080
Gun.

294
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,760
Mr. Ji asked me to tell you

295
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,880
that your archenemy is also here.

296
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,920
Don't walk around without permission.

297
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,560
Which enemy?

298
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,720
The one who killed Yu.

299
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,560
Where's my son?

300
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,720
He's talking to Mr. Gu.

301
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,280
You,

302
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,800
stay put.

303
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,160
Don't wander around.

304
00:17:22,736 --> 00:17:23,696
Come here for a moment.

305
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:33,960
You go

306
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,160
talk to Zhou Ji.

307
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,720
What does this mean?

308
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,240
You still don't believe me?

309
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,720
What do you think?

310
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,080
It's all here.

311
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,040
See for yourself.

312
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,320
Hello?

313
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,800
(Fei.)

314
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,640
(Thank you.)

315
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,520
I know you sincerely want to help me.

316
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,160
I also want to help you.

317
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,200
Do you know Lu Wentian?

318
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,800
(Fei.)

319
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,600
Let me tell you the story of Liujia Bay.

320
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,080
Yin fades, and Yang grows.

321
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,640
Three lambs bring bliss.

322
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,640
Once a year,

323
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,080
we gather for the golden lamb.

324
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,120
First of all,

325
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,000
allow me to represent Blue Sky Hotel

326
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,640
and welcome all partners and customers.

327
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,880
May the golden lamb be fat
and business be smooth.

328
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,640
This year, as usual,

329
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,552
the winner of the Golden Lamb Festival

330
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,800
will receive one percent
of the group's annual profit

331
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,560
for use in Kalisha's

332
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,440
charity and education projects.

333
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,000
Now,

334
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,000
let's welcome the golden lamb.

335
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,880
Who's that?

336
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,120
Mr. Cheng, it's me.

337
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,280
Linna, have a seat.

338
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,560
Sorry to disturb you.

339
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,520
Have a seat.

340
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,920
Mr. Cheng.

341
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,200
I've come to find you

342
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,800
because of two things.

343
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,440
Go ahead.

344
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,320
I saw Long Qi
at the Western Grand Hotel.

345
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,880
But he might be at my house now.

346
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,520
Yet I didn't find his check-in information.

347
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,200
Also,

348
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,440
the owner of that hotel

349
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,280
is the old man

350
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,520
you asked me to identify.

351
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,960
But he's not a deaf-mute.

352
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,440
He can speak.

353
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,440
The deaf-mute in Hanbei Hospital?

354
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,360
Yes.

355
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,880
Why were you in the Western Grand Hotel?

356
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,016
To have dinner with my brother-in-law.

357
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,600
I could feel Long Qi was in danger

358
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,640
at that time.

359
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,240
But I didn't know which room he was in.

360
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,400
I couldn't help him.

361
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,080
But I haven't mentioned this matter
to anyone.

362
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:29,880
I promise.

363
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,840
I'm sorry.

364
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,760
I only know this much.

365
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,520
It's okay.

366
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,960
You're overthinking it.

367
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,440
So, what's the second thing?

368
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,360
This was taken on my sixth birthday.

369
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,200
My dad's name

370
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,680
is Gu Jianguo.

371
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,800
My mom's name

372
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,880
is Jiang Jiulin.

373
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,040
But

374
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,120
they all lied to me.

375
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,760
Now,

376
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,240
I can basically confirm

377
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,240
that my dad

378
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,840
is the villain
everyone is cursing in Kalisha,

379
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,760
Gu Mulan.

380
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,480
But don't worry.

381
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,920
I won't harm you.

382
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,040
I won't harm anyone here.

383
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,480
Mr. Cheng.

384
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,520
Can I turn myself in?

385
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,760
Nana.

386
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,320
Regardless of what your dad

387
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,960
has done,

388
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,320
you won't be held responsible for it.

389
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,120
I admire your courage.

390
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,240
Do you know where your dad is now?

391
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,880
He said he was in Moscow.

392
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,080
I didn't ask for the specifics.

393
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,080
But he just called me.

394
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,840
(Recent calls)
It's the first number.

395
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,200
Well,

396
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,640
how do you remember your dad?

397
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,680
I

398
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,072
don't have any memories of him.

399
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,240
The only thing
I have a slight impression of

400
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,280
is my sixth birthday.

401
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,120
Do you remember the wound on my foot?

402
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,720
It wasn't from a hyena bite.

403
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,360
It was a bullet wound.

404
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,480
21st August 2006.

405
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,080
It was my birthday.

406
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,320
At that time, your dad was holding you.

407
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,200
It should be.

408
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,800
I don't remember it very well.

409
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,720
I'm sorry.

410
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,160
It's okay.

411
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,440
Mr. Cheng.

412
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,960
As I said last time,

413
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,360
I love my body.

414
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,440
Mr. Cheng.

415
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,400
I don't know what my dad

416
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,360
has done.

417
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,360
But please believe

418
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,160
that my uncle

419
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,040
and my sister

420
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,120
are both good people.

421
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,640
They are very kind and law-abiding.

422
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,960
Can you

423
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,440
not harm them?

424
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,080
You can rest assured.

425
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,280
We won't wrongly accuse any innocent,
good people.

426
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,480
I've said everything.

427
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,120
If you have any more questions,

428
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,440
feel free to come to me anytime,

429
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,560
including my uncle and sister.

430
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,640
They will cooperate.

431
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,640
Nana.

432
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,320
Don't stress yourself too much.

433
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,280
Qiao Dan.

434
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,400
Get some water.

435
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,800
Let's just have a casual chat.

436
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,224
Let's talk about your family,

437
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,600
your uncle,

438
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,800
your sister,

439
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,600
and your brother-in-law.

440
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,520
Now, let's welcome our boxing champion,

441
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,880
Jiang,

442
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,680
onto the stage.

443
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,920
Cheers and applause.

444
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
Jiang!

445
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,160
Jiang!

446
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,120
Jiang!

447
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,720
If anyone wants to challenge him,
please come on stage.

448
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,880
Jiang!

449
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,080
Jiang!

450
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,080
Jiang!

451
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,760
It's as lively as ever this year.

452
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,360
Right.

453
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,520
Jiang!

454
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,400
Anyone in the audience

455
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,000
wants to challenge him?

456
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,400
If there is, come on stage

457
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,800
and accept the challenge from Jiang.

458
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,440
Come on.

459
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,560
Can I hear some applause and cheers?

460
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,240
Yin.

461
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,880
I see our contestant

462
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,600
has already entered our octagon cage.

463
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,200
Let's interview him.
Please introduce yourself.

464
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,640
Nice!

465
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,640
Wenli.

466
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,200
I'll go over there
and say hello to my old friends.

467
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,200
Jiang!

468
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,580
(Xia Peng)

469
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,120
(Captain of Kalisha's)
Good job, Captain Duan.

470
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,000
(Criminal Investigation Brigade)
I'm Xia Peng from Kalisha.

471
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,944
I'm Duan Qing from Hanbei.

472
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,000
Why did you come down?

473
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:10,840
Go back.

474
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,160
Gun asked me to come.

475
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,520
There's a cop.

476
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,680
To arrest you?

477
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,360
What are you trying to do?

478
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:25,960
Nothing.

479
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,400
Just walking around.

480
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,800
(Thanks for the information.)

481
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,640
(But there are some things)

482
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,400
(can only be discussed
when it's convenient.)

483
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,560
(Go back now.)

484
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,000
What do you mean?

485
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,080
Are you trying to frame me?

486
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,400
Buddy.

487
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,600
There are some things

488
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,400
that need to be clarified.

489
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,040
You've got the wrong person.

490
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,840
Then there's nothing to talk about.

491
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,080
Go back.

492
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,960
Continue talking.

493
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,280
Ask him
if he's been to Liujia Bay cave dwellings.

494
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,040
Liujia Bay cave dwellings.

495
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,680
Have you been there?

496
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,000
I've been there long ago,

497
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,000
and there,

498
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,600
I heard about something incredible.

499
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,640
A shocking miscarriage of justice.

500
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,240
(About my brother-in-law,)

501
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,480
(that's all I know.)

502
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,280
(But I still want to believe)

503
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,840
(he's a good person at heart.)

504
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:23,760
Master.

505
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,240
I saw Yihan downstairs.

506
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,800
Go.

507
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,440
Bring Dr. Mu over.

508
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,160
Okay.

509
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,560
Nana.

510
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,600
Let's end our discussion here.

511
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,520
Thank you.

512
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,120
Okay. Goodbye, Mr. Cheng.

513
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,240
Goodbye.

514
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
Oh, by the way,

515
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,600
ask Long Qi to be careful.

516
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,320
In this match,

517
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,080
Yin wins!

518
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,720
Yin!

519
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,600
That was a good match.

520
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,480
For those in the audience
who want to challenge Yin,

521
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,680
please come on stage.

522
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,800
If not,

523
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,640
then today's golden lamb

524
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,640
will belong to Yin.

525
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,080
Okay. Let me count down.

526
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,200
If there's no challenger,

527
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,840
Yin,

528
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,200
you'll take the golden lamb home today,
okay?

529
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,720
Come on, everyone.
Let's countdown together.

530
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,600
Ten.

531
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,240
Nine.

532
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,200
Eight!

533
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,400
Seven!

534
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,520
Six!

535
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,000
Five.

536
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,880
Four.

537
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,120
Three.

538
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,400
I believe some people
have already recognized this contestant.

539
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,040
He is our province's three-time
boxing champion.

540
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,480
He's the Desert War God,

541
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,000
named...

542
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,040
Ku!

543
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:51,040
Ku!

544
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:57,640
Ku!

545
00:31:59,648 --> 00:32:00,200
Captain Xia.

546
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,680
Hi.

547
00:32:00,704 --> 00:32:01,664
I've told you many times.

548
00:32:01,696 --> 00:32:02,960
The line must be investigated now.

549
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,256
Tell them to come and replace it.

550
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,320
Qiao Dan.

551
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,360
Everything's set.

552
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,200
Ku, come on!

553
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,080
Ku!

554
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,960
Come on!

555
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,720
Ku!

556
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,640
Ku!

557
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,600
Ku.

558
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,600
(Ku.)

559
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,800
(Ku.)

560
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,200
Hello?

561
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,240
(Mr. Cheng.)

562
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,160
The food is ready.

563
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,600
The person is also here.

564
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,440
If you're free,

565
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,520
come down for a visit.

566
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,160
Alright.

567
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,280
I'll come down right away.

568
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,040
Alright, I'll wait for you.

569
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,000
You can go back now.

570
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,760
Ku!

571
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,040
(Don't move.)

572
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,600
Mr. Jiang.

573
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,640
Thank you.

574
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,320
Here, Officer Cheng. Sit here.

575
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,760
Dr. Mu, you're here too.

576
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,560
Officer Cheng.

577
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,400
Xiaowan, come and sit here.

578
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,240
The specifications
for this competition are really high.

579
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,000
That's right.

580
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,040
This Ku.

581
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,000
I heard about him in Hanbei.

582
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,200
Who invited him?

583
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,560
The person I told you about,

584
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,680
my son-in-law, Zhou Ji, invited him.

585
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,400
Officer Cheng.

586
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,240
I am a person

587
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,560
who cares a lot about family

588
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,800
and my family members.

589
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,240
If you think he has a problem,

590
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,640
feel free to investigate.

591
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,760
I'll cooperate fully.

592
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,440
Hello, Gun.

593
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,080
(Did you see Cheng Fan?)

594
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,280
Of course.

595
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,200
If he dares to come,

596
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,840
he must have come prepared.

597
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,680
Whether he's after you or me,

598
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,120
if one of us fails,

599
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,600
we'll all be finished.

600
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,560
(I'll give you five boxes.)

601
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,680
(Don't let him leave this place alive.)

602
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,680
He's a police officer.

603
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,600
He's also a heart patient.

604
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,720
Sudden death

605
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,120
is sometimes unavoidable.

606
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,600
(If you don't do it, I will.)

607
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,640
If a police officer dies here,

608
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,480
I don't believe you can clear your name.

609
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,640
Gun.

610
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,880
Listen to me.

611
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,280
Don't be impulsive.

612
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:28,840
Leave it to me.

613
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,120
Alright?

614
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,560
Hello?

615
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,480
Boss.

616
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,480
Zhou Ji is up to no good.

617
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,800
Your judgment was spot-on.

618
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,080
I brought two of our men in.

619
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,920
Others are guarding at the door.

620
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,520
Jin.

621
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,120
There's a cop here.

622
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,920
Don't be impulsive.

623
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,280
Take some people to coordinate.

624
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,680
Don't let Long Qi
get caught by the police.

625
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,560
(Also,)

626
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,800
(Gu's daughter is here too.)

627
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,000
Find a chance

628
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,272
to take her away together.

629
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,480
Alright.

630
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,640
(Zhou Ji is a cunning person.)

631
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,280
He invited me to Hanbei,

632
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,200
(likely planning a sneak attack.)

633
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,800
(Then he'll go after you,)

634
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,880
(and use you to blackmail me.)

635
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,120
(Be prepared.)

636
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,480
Understood.

637
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,640
Answer the phone.

638
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,440
Boss.

639
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,600
Forget about me.

640
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,760
Did I look convincing?

641
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,240
Very convincing.

642
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,320
Ku!

643
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,320
Ku!

644
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,400
Ku!

645
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,880
Bring two pots of tea

646
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,240
to Mr. Jiang's table.

647
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,240
Others will have Pu'er tea.

648
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,200
The one in a wheelchair

649
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,520
will have Apocynum tea.

650
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,440
Go now.

651
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,120
The fight is intense.

652
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,480
Come, try some lamb.

653
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:21,960
It's really delicious.

654
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,400
Here, Dr. Mu.

655
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,920
I've heard about it.

656
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,800
They say the lambs in Kalisha

657
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,040
drink glacial water

658
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,720
and are herbal-fed.

659
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,640
Even their feces are all herbal pills.

660
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,240
Eat more.

661
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,200
If you like it,

662
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,200
I have more.

663
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,360
I have a question.

664
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,480
I'm curious.

665
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,240
You're a top expert
in cardiothoracic surgery.

666
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,000
Why did you leave the central hospital

667
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,600
and start Murray Hospital?

668
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,040
It's like this.

669
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,360
At that time,
the medical conditions and equipment

670
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,040
at the central hospital were very bad.

671
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,200
Mr. Mu wanted to
improve the local medical standards,

672
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,240
so he invested with me

673
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,488
and established Murray Hospital.

674
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,240
I finally found you.

675
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
This is quite sumptuous.

676
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,440
Here.

677
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,480
Freshly roasted.

678
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,280
Here.

679
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,360
Come on!

680
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,280
Come on!

681
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,560
Ku!

682
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,560
Ku!

683
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,720
Ku!

684
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,840
Ku!

685
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,400
Xiaowan.

686
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,240
Someone.

687
00:39:28,336 --> 00:39:29,376
Take him to the hospital.

688
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:30,800
Master.

689
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:31,600
Water.

690
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,480
I'll go check.

691
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,160
The winner of this match

692
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,440
is...

693
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,240
Ku!

694
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,680
Applause for Ku.

695
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,160
Are there any more people
in the audience

696
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,440
who want to challenge Ku?

697
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,240
Please come on stage.

698
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,120
Your dad seems a bit unhappy.

699
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,840
Let me go check.

700
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,320
Jiang.

701
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,800
I'll take him back for a checkup.

702
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,960
Make way.

703
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,560
Dad.

704
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,560
Zhou Ji.

705
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,280
What are you trying to do?

706
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,160
It's a competitive sport.

707
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,920
Injuries are unavoidable.

708
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,200
Besides,

709
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,640
it's just entertainment.

710
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,728
Don't take it too seriously.

711
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,560
How about this?

712
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,000
I'll apologize

713
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,160
on behalf of Ku.

714
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,080
Zhou Ji.

715
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,720
You know that Yin has been with me
since he was 16.

716
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,400
If something happens to him,
how can I explain it to him?

717
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,400
How about this?

718
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,800
Let Ku follow you

719
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,472
and be your personal assistant.

720
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,440
He's much

721
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,880
smarter than Yin.

722
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,720
His service will be excellent.

723
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,840
What do you think?

724
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,600
Zhou Ji.

725
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,280
Tonight, we have distinguished guests
from all walks of life,

726
00:41:14,528 --> 00:41:16,576
including an officer
from the Public Security Bureau.

727
00:41:17,088 --> 00:41:18,120
This Golden Lamb Festival

728
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,400
is not our family matter.

729
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,080
Mr. Jiang.

730
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,840
Don't be agitated.

731
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,560
You must be the friend my dad invited.

732
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,480
Look at my hand.

733
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,720
I'm Cheng Fan from Hanbei.

734
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,600
Zhou Ji.

735
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,200
Mr. Zhou.

736
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,400
Officer Cheng.

737
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,200
In our country,

738
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,420
how many years does one get

739
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,800
for illegal possession of firearms?

740
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,160
That depends on the specific situation.

741
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,720
Does anyone here

742
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,160
possess firearms illegally?

743
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,904
Illegal possession of firearms?

744
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,680
Who would dare?

745
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,280
Mr. Zhou.

746
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,400
I just received a report
from the public.

747
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,200
It said there are prohibited items

748
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,800
in your room.

749
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,120
Prohibited items?

750
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,624
What prohibited items?

751
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,680
It seems to be ivory products.

752
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,120
Who's the audacious person

753
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,960
making such a joke?

754
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,200
Officer Cheng.

755
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,080
I don't need you
to show a search warrant.

756
00:42:18,848 --> 00:42:20,896
I invite you to come to my room
and see for yourself.

757
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,600
Well...

758
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,760
Are you here alone?

759
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,800
I have another colleague.

760
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,200
Okay.

761
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,840
Please bring him along.

762
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,200
Qiao Dan.

763
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,960
Come to the octagon cage.

764
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,400
Wait a moment.

765
00:42:45,552 --> 00:42:47,232
Do you see that person
in the wheelchair?

766
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,000
(Does he look familiar?)

767
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,400
We failed last time.

768
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,600
Let's try again today.

769
00:42:56,352 --> 00:42:57,472
There are too many people.

770
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,640
It's inconvenient.

771
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,720
I want him dead today.

772
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,120
What are you doing here?

773
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,136
I was looking for you.

774
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,160
It's only been two days,

775
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,680
and you miss me this much?

776
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,120
You jerk.

777
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,480
Where else do you want to hide?

778
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,320
(Come with me.)

779
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,560
Bring that girl back for me first.

780
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,160
Come with me.

781
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,760
This is my home.

782
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,520
Let's find a place with no one around

783
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,760
and settle our score properly.

784
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:00,880
Long Qi.

785
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,080
Where are you going?

786
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,240
Bring her back.

787
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,040
Mr. Ji.

788
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,800
Sorry.

789
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,000
Is she really Gu's daughter?

790
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,320
(Yes.)

791
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:12,600
Don't worry.

792
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,920
I know what to do.

793
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,620
(I'm Gu Mulan's daughter.
Do you believe me?)

794
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:32,340
(You may not believe me, but someone
wants to harm you. Leave now!)

795
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,664
(Gu Linna is Gu Mulan's daughter.)

796
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,360
