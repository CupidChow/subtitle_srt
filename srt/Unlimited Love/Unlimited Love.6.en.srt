1
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,524
If Lychee pass this course.

2
00:01:19,524 --> 00:01:22,969
I can tell you that she will become very beautiful. 

3
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:27,287
If you wear this outfit, the dog won't bark.

4
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,400
Right?

5
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,000
Where did Lychee?

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,680
She's studying right now, so how could she have disappeared?

7
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,611
I'm so bored.

8
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:35,959
I want to be with you.

9
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:39,659
Mom, the girl from the unlimited company

10
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,330
That you watched with me the other day.

11
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,007
Action.

12
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:45,962
Hello everyone.

13
00:01:45,962 --> 00:01:48,147
And this is my new channel.

14
00:01:48,187 --> 00:01:54,600
The channel name is Lychee!

15
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,560
Today, I'm going to talk about fashion and lifestyle.

16
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,660
Because as everyone knows, Lychee is Palm's younger sibling.

17
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,378
So fashion is already in the blood.

18
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:17,310
This shirt I'm wearing is a K2Y style.

19
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,685
It's not.

20
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:20,154
KY.

21
00:02:20,154 --> 00:02:23,394
No, that's not right

22
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:25,456
Y2K.

23
00:02:25,456 --> 00:02:27,318
Hey, that's right.

24
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:31,600
Well, it's from the...

25
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,282
1969s 

26
00:02:33,282 --> 00:02:35,687
Not again.

27
00:02:35,687 --> 00:02:37,574
1956s

28
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,655
It's still not correct.

29
00:02:39,655 --> 00:02:41,618
1990s

30
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:45,883
It was leading up to the year 2000.

31
00:02:45,883 --> 00:02:50,373
And in the year 2000...

32
00:02:50,373 --> 00:02:55,268
They were all afraid that computer systems worldwide.

33
00:02:55,268 --> 00:02:57,374
Would crash and the world would just end.

34
00:02:57,374 --> 00:02:59,716
Maybe I'm being too serious, you should probably go read about it yourself. 

35
00:02:59,716 --> 00:03:01,716
You should probably go read about it yourself. 

36
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:07,151
The top I'm wearing is a small, cropped top.

37
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:09,003
It's called a crop top.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,139
Hey.

39
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:12,790
It's wrong.

40
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,242
Is that wrong?

41
00:03:14,242 --> 00:03:15,587
Crop.

42
00:03:16,032 --> 00:03:17,854
Crop.

43
00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:23,953
I mean a crop top and wearing it with low-rise pants like these.

44
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:28,001
The kind that look like they’re about to fall right off your butt!

45
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:31,803
And then also wearing a dog collar necklace with it.

46
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:36,076
Choker.

47
00:03:36,076 --> 00:03:40,902
That's so cool!

48
00:03:40,902 --> 00:03:42,490
OMG!

49
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,646
Look at the view of Lychee.

50
00:03:44,646 --> 00:03:46,920
So high.

51
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:50,314
See comments.

52
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,632
What are they commenting?

53
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,000
That's so bad.

54
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,892
Animal.

55
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,735
Flower.

56
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,150
Ow, That's so bad.

57
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,411
Animal.

58
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,121
Bit*h.

59
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,632
Why are the comments so harsh?

60
00:04:07,632 --> 00:04:09,991
Is this pearl or shell?

61
00:04:09,991 --> 00:04:12,872
Or solid waste on the beach.

62
00:04:12,872 --> 00:04:15,932
She reviewed Y2K clothes with some really old Jurassic jokes.

63
00:04:15,932 --> 00:04:18,621
Very funny.

64
00:04:18,621 --> 00:04:22,330
It's funny because the joke totally bombed.

65
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:25,323
I feel secondhand embarrassment for Palm.

66
00:04:25,323 --> 00:04:27,842
The joke wasn't funny, and now it's just awkward.

67
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:33,928
She turned from a dog tick into a swan.

68
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:37,312
But her inner self is still low-class.

69
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,000
If you can't handle it, just quit.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,350
I guess her mom forced her into this.

71
00:04:43,553 --> 00:04:45,865
I heard she's sponging off her daughter.

72
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,348
I'm going to kick them all if I see them! 

73
00:04:52,348 --> 00:04:57,330
Ouch!

74
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,853
Why are you arriving now?

75
00:05:32,853 --> 00:05:36,521
You're not dressed properly, you're not wearing a necktie and you're late.

76
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,291
Someone is waiting for you, you know?

77
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:18,692
I was driving as fast as I could!

78
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,877
Hey, even if you're in a rush, you still need to be careful!

79
00:06:22,877 --> 00:06:26,954
How could I live if anything happened to her?

80
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:28,424
Huh.

81
00:06:30,247 --> 00:06:32,715
Is everything okay, Ms. Mai?

82
00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:35,492
Uh, I'm okay.

83
00:06:35,492 --> 00:06:37,561
My name is Mui not Mai.

84
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,685
Your name is so cute!

85
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:42,035
My name is Gaga.

86
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:44,207
Can I borrow your phone?

87
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:50,594
Here's my number.

88
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:51,968
If you want to go anywhere, just call me directly.

89
00:06:51,968 --> 00:06:53,097
No need to go through the app.

90
00:06:53,097 --> 00:06:54,460
See you.

91
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,666
Rival in love.

92
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:19,960
[Singing]

93
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:50,401
[Music]

94
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:52,237
Oh, what is this?

95
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:54,111
What are you dancing?

96
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,759
It's work time, huh?

97
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,553
Hey, It's you!

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,482
And what about you?

99
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,610
Could you please introduce yourself?

100
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,207
My name is Mui. The company sent me here to help Ms. Yim.

101
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,870
Mui, Mayuree Teepom

102
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,765
I'm from Surat Thani.

103
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:30,953
Calm down, you're a security guard, not a beauty queen!

104
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,482
Um, anyway.

105
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:36,397
If you have some free time.

106
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:38,468
You should take her around to say hi to everyone in the company.

107
00:08:38,468 --> 00:08:39,715
Okay.

108
00:08:40,695 --> 00:08:41,675
Oh! okay.

109
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:55,373
[Singing]

110
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,801
Alright everyone, let's start the meeting today.

111
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:00,383
Can you hear me clearly, Joice?

112
00:09:00,383 --> 00:09:04,279
I can hear you. Okay, let's start.

113
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,586
[Screaming]

114
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,993
Meeting like this feels like a Charlie's Angels movie.

115
00:09:08,993 --> 00:09:14,863
Plu, Can  you  say  good
morning  angels  for  me?

116
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,480
Good  morning angel.

117
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,569
Good  morning, Boss.

118
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:28,951
As for the first live stream of Lychee...

119
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:31,325
We've all seen how boring it was.

120
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:33,162
Let's brainstorm what we should do next.

121
00:09:34,162 --> 00:09:36,549
Seriously, I think that anything that is not us, do not force it.

122
00:09:36,968 --> 00:09:42,809
Or actually, we should tell Ms. Palm directly that.

123
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:44,791
we need a break from the project.

124
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,800
As for the expenses, we can collect the receipts and handle 
 the reimbursement later.

125
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,640
As for Lychee, we can find other ways later.

126
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,494
We can handle it.

127
00:09:53,494 --> 00:09:54,462
Don't worry about it.

128
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:58,412
Let's lotus on Grandma Lam's situation now.

129
00:09:58,412 --> 00:10:00,470
Focus.

130
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,135
Yeah, focus.

131
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,042
What is the story of this Grandma Lam? Try telling it in short.

132
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,538
Here's the thing.

133
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:18,120
Since that day, Grandma has been unresponsive, no longer 
 conscious at all.

134
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,446
We feel so sorry for Grandma.

135
00:10:20,446 --> 00:10:24,438
Since she found out that Luka and Ching passed away.

136
00:10:24,438 --> 00:10:26,210
She hasn't been aware of anything anymore.

137
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,088
Until the day she saw the surprise wedding clip 
 from your company.

138
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:41,881
We are very pleased that Grandma saw our clip.

139
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:44,306
and still felt it for a moment.

140
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,256
What will both of you hire the unlimited company to do? 

141
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:58,320
Don't tell me that.

142
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,750
Do we have to help Grandma Lam recover?

143
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,161
Yes, something like that.

144
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,980
Wait, how is that even possible?

145
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,162
We're not a doctor.

146
00:11:07,272 --> 00:11:10,327
Calm down, listen first.

147
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,682
Please find a way for Grandma Lam to let go of the guilt.

148
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,310
She feels towards the dog and her grandson.

149
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,071
Who passed away because of her.

150
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:30,381
Oh, sh*t!

151
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:35,275
Can I get the details?

152
00:11:36,677 --> 00:11:40,346
This information is from our group.

153
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:42,974
The 'Long Khon' ceremony is a Northern Thai belief.

154
00:11:42,974 --> 00:11:45,701
It involves calling the spirit of a deceased person 
 to possess a trained individual.

155
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:49,598
who is referred to as the 'khon'.

156
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:58,200
Wait, you mean we literally have to call a spirit to 
  possess someone's body?
