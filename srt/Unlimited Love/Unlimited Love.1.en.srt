1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,026
We’re all going to be in trouble.

2
00:00:08,026 --> 00:00:09,793
Where can we find food made from flowers.

00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:20,798
If she actually comes, our budget definitely won’t be enough.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,080
Come here.

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,439

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,480
Plu, can I ask you some questions?

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,520
We've worked together on so many projects already.

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,239
If I’m here, Plu has to be here too.

14
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,920
What else do I have to be afraid of? Don't worry.

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,759
Don't worry.

16
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:16,520
What do you think?

17
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:26,759
Can I help you?

18
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,560
Really?

19
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,320
Well, please sit down first?

20
00:01:53,320 --> 00:02:00,320
Just sit back and relax, that could be easy.

21
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,467
Mr. Karj.

22
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:07,967
Damn it!

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,328
Mr.Karj literally came bursting through the door!
I don’t know why she’s so angry.

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What happened?

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,814
Boss.

26
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:15,080
Plu gone crazy. She says that I'm using her too much.

27
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,993
Stop messing around right now, Karj!

28
00:03:16,993 --> 00:03:19,248
Plu, Why do you have to do it this way?

29
00:03:19,248 --> 00:03:21,460
This guy is trying to touch my chest.

30
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,689
Nomnoo? Nomnoo (jet nipple) for a car, right?

31
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:26,772
I mean, it’s my chest.

32
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,000
Boss, please ignore it.

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,200
A person with good qualities like me.
why should I bother with someone like that?

34
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,439
She's always  lure at me. The boss also knows this, She likes to gossip behind your back.

35
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:45,280
You're also criticizing the boss behind her back.

36
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:52,697
It says the boss is as smart as a peanut, blurry, stupid and obsessed with it like a dog.Whatever he say, you believe it all.

37
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,799
Boss, believe her or will the boss believe me?

38
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:15,000
My arm hurts so much. Ouch!

39
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:16,739
Plu.

40
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:21,013
Why are you treating Karj like this?

41
00:04:21,013 --> 00:04:25,000
Pack up your things and get out!

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,786

53
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,680
Hey, Plu please tell me why did you get fired?

54
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm so confused. And your boss, whatever they want,
they have to get it.

55
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,199
That’s why they are behaving like this.
He’s going to touch my chest.

56
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,777
So I kicked him.

57
00:06:13,777 --> 00:06:19,800
If I were there. I’m gonna thrash him.

58
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,400
I've been fired. I don't know what to do next.

59
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,642
Will you help me sell fertilizer here
or would you prefer to be a real estate agent?

60
00:06:30,642 --> 00:06:35,238
Why don't you give it a try first?

61
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:39,035
Stay tough and patient like a cowor like a buffalo like you
and take it easy finding a new job.

62
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:41,604
Well, look at you praising me!

63
00:06:41,604 --> 00:06:43,246

I also have news to tell you too.

71
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,148
But you can talk about your news first.

72
00:07:35,148 --> 00:07:40,147

73
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,879
Really, This is really awesome Faiyen must be really happy.

74
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:55,495
Yeah, but the school’s charging 8,000 baht for the uniform.

75
00:07:55,495 --> 00:07:58,286
Plu, make sure you transfer the money to Mom too, okay?

76
00:07:58,286 --> 00:07:59,341
Wait a moment, mom.

77
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:01,924
Seriously? What kind of uniform is that? 8,000 baht?!

78
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:07,740
Beautiful things with good qualityare supposed to be expensive.

Looking for a new job.

82
00:08:27,144 --> 00:08:29,425
Oh, so what about your old job?

83
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,919
They fired me already. We're having a bit of a problem.

84
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,933
You've been fired. What have you done that got you kicked out?

85
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:41,760
Where will we get the money to pay for Faiyen

86
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,240
And what about Nong Ong,  who’s going to start high school?

87
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,920
Why do you have to lose your job now?

88
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,819
Anyway, I’ll transfer the money soon.

89
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:57,777
But at the moment, I’d appreciate your help.

90
00:08:57,777 --> 00:09:00,359
Let’s save some money for now.

91
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:21,720

92
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,646
Where are you now? Let me come find you.

93
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:29,737
He is still asking to meet us here.

94
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:33,680
Tell me to apologize him and then go back to working with it. it's going to be crazy.

95
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,360
But you're not the one who's wrong.
Why are you going to apologize to him?

96
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,519
Is it my dad's friend or my mom's friend?
I don't recognize them at all.

97
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,880
Huh...I feel terrible.

98
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,680
No job. No money and my family also need more money.

99
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:18,120
My family also need more money.You'll find a new job
by the beginning of next month at the latest.

100
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:26,040
To lazy to look for it. I'm so lazy to do what the boss wants.

101
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,880
Oh, Plu doesn't have to cry.

102
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,240
Oh, you don't have to cry.

103
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,279
Oh, you don't have to cry.

104
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,519
Why should I stop you from crying?
Do you want to cry? Then, shout it out!

105
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:51,639
Cry it out.

106
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:59,279
Cry it out, cry as a friend.
One, two, three...

107
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,519
Why am I crying?

108
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,279
I don't want to be oppressed anymore.

109
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,440
So why don't you just start your own company?

110
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,519
You don't have to be anyone's subordinate,
you don't have to wait for anyone to give you orders.

111
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,000
And you don't have to beg anyone, either. Isn't that great?

112
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,360
I don't have any money.
What kind of company can a person like us start?

113
00:11:55,157 --> 00:12:07,200
Do whatever you want. Turn small things into big ones, sew.

114
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,240
Build rockets, whatever. Just think about it.

115
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:23,920
So, what would be a good name for our company?

116
00:12:24,354 --> 00:12:26,532
Hey! company. Why do you think?

117
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:32,080
Oh, I don't want this company at all. Who would want to hire this?

118
00:12:34,496 --> 00:12:39,703
The Unlimited company.

119
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:13,092
Shit!

120
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,440
Where is it?
