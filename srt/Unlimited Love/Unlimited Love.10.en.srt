1
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,228
The Unlimited Cha Ni Tham?

2
00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:52,887
I want everyone to go and come up with their own characters.

3
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:55,454
Be creative and colorful.

4
00:00:55,454 --> 00:00:57,094
Let's think outside the box.

5
00:00:57,094 --> 00:00:59,600
May I ask a favor of you?

6
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,193
Could you possibly come to my company right now?

7
00:01:02,193 --> 00:01:03,824
Oh my god!

8
00:01:03,824 --> 00:01:06,571
Your company is about to run into a big problem.

9
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:09,723
Please, don't ask me anything right now.

10
00:01:09,723 --> 00:01:12,243
Can everyone please leave this building first?

11
00:01:12,243 --> 00:01:16,094
Get out now!

12
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:19,799
Get out!

13
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,995
Hey! What the hell is going on?

14
00:01:21,995 --> 00:01:23,973
Who the owner of this building will be.

15
00:01:23,973 --> 00:01:25,060
I don't really care.

16
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,226
But this is my chili paste.

17
00:01:27,226 --> 00:01:29,225
I am going to sell my chili paste.

18
00:01:29,225 --> 00:01:32,050
Regardless of how, they must sell my chili paste up to ten million baht.

19
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,857
Just you wait, I'll deal with all of you.

20
00:01:33,857 --> 00:01:35,692
Let's go back!

21
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:38,044
What's with all the drama here?

22
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,827
If Karj is truly your soulmate, he will help with your luck.

23
00:01:48,827 --> 00:01:51,016
You will receive great fortune. 

24
00:01:51,016 --> 00:01:53,960
Winning the lottery first prize!

25
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:09,554
You knew about this from the beginning, didn't you?

26
00:02:09,554 --> 00:02:10,981
Tell me everything.

27
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,804
The story actually starts with me.

28
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:23,473
I have an aunt named Rung.

29
00:02:23,473 --> 00:02:26,995
She's been a bedridden patient for a very long time.

30
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:31,265
She has a daughter named Ryu, but she went to study abroad.

31
00:02:31,265 --> 00:02:35,530
And never contacted a auntie again.

32
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,986
During that time, I took care of auntie.

33
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:43,173
Taking her to the hospital, feeding her, giving her water 
 and medicine.

34
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:46,816
And my aunt always told me that.

35
00:02:46,816 --> 00:02:49,336
If anything ever happened to her.

36
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,299
She would give the building to me.

37
00:02:57,299 --> 00:02:59,655
When my aunt passed away.

38
00:02:59,655 --> 00:03:01,524
I still haven't been able to contact Ryu.

39
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,186
Then I met Plu, and invited her to start a company with me.

40
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,347
Until Ryu returned from abroad.

41
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:22,998
Aunt Rung really said to give this building to me.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,594
I have to find evidence.

43
00:03:26,594 --> 00:03:34,166
But at least we know that Ray didn't intend to deceive us.

44
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,261
Does that mean you knew about this all along, Plu?

45
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:45,928
Actually, I've been suspicious for a while now.

46
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,698
Until I learned the truth from Ray.

47
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:55,000
And Ray asked for some time to handle things herself first.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,413
It's just as you all can see.

49
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:04,357
Honestly, the reason I first applied for a job here.

50
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:10,158
Because I saw that we could work outside the box and it looked fun.

51
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:16,721
But now there are no ownership documents for this building.

52
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:22,892
I can't handle this risk.

53
00:04:22,892 --> 00:04:26,694
I saw you as an idol.

54
00:04:26,694 --> 00:04:30,800
That time you saved me from getting splashed with hot water.

55
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,156
But today, I'm really disappointed in you.

56
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,898
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,281
I still want our company to continue.

58
00:04:46,281 --> 00:04:48,840
I will try my best.

59
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:55,000
But if everyone isn't okay with this company anymore.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,884
It's okay, I understand completely.

61
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:04,237
Thank you for fighting this together.

62
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:07,481
If anyone chooses to leave.

63
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:09,436
I will compensate them financially according to the law.

64
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:28,709
Thank you so much for letting me stay and sleep here 
 at the company.

65
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:32,318
But if it's like this.

66
00:05:32,318 --> 00:05:35,070
I guess I'll have to find a new job and a new place to stay too.

67
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,880
You can just stay at my house.

68
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,703
That way, you'll have one less thing to worry about.

69
00:05:46,703 --> 00:05:47,857
Okay?

70
00:05:49,495 --> 00:05:50,576
Thank you.

71
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,000
Thank you for giving us the opportunity to intern here.

72
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,651
I've had a lot of fun here.

73
00:06:07,651 --> 00:06:11,010
But it's really time for us to part ways.

74
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:14,731
Right?

75
00:07:01,952 --> 00:07:03,337
Hey!

76
00:07:07,236 --> 00:07:08,422
You.

77
00:07:08,422 --> 00:07:10,543
Who are you?

78
00:07:10,543 --> 00:07:14,130
Your time is up.

79
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,547
You already knew the cheat code.

80
00:07:16,547 --> 00:07:19,495
If you could get your karmic creditors to ordain.

81
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:20,998
You would be saved.

82
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:22,747
But you did nothing about it.

83
00:07:25,974 --> 00:07:26,809
Handsome.

84
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:32,205
Get ready to go to the onsen at the hell with me.

85
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,691
Okay everyone, it's alright that there's only a few of us left.

86
00:07:56,691 --> 00:07:58,996
We have nothing left to lose anyway.

87
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:02,756
I understand where everyone stands.

88
00:08:02,756 --> 00:08:05,992
But I still believe we can make it work.

89
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,049
Just ask yourself whether to stay or to go.

90
00:08:13,049 --> 00:08:16,302
But my feelings are telling me to stay.

91
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,000
I believe in Ray.

92
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,376
We've worked together for so long.

93
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,413
Let's keep fighting!

94
00:08:25,428 --> 00:08:30,683
Our next important goal is to get that building back for Ray.

95
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:32,505
I took it too.

96
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,125
You are speaking very impolitely.

97
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:42,780
Can I only speak politely to you?

98
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,881
Absolutely.

99
00:08:47,881 --> 00:08:49,213
I want in too.

100
00:08:49,213 --> 00:08:51,260
This is not just about the buildings.

101
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,013
it's about justice.

102
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:56,573
We must fight.

103
00:08:56,573 --> 00:09:00,848
Thank you all very much for helping me.

104
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:05,751
Then let's go to auntie  Rung's house.

105
00:09:05,751 --> 00:09:07,879
Let's go find the will.

106
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,197
Find the will.

107
00:09:09,197 --> 00:09:11,010
Find the will.

108
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,049
Mrs. Yingsri called.

109
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,000
Where have you all disappeared to?

110
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,360
Do you know that the company's page is being criticized right now?

111
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,002
Go check it out.

112
00:09:28,478 --> 00:09:32,716
I ordered ages ago and heard nothing back.

113
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:35,047
What's going on?

114
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:39,203
Frog chili paste, lychee chili paste.

115
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,459
No one is responding to me.

116
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:41,428
Will I ever get to eat them?

117
00:09:41,428 --> 00:09:44,424
This is completely deceiving consumers!

118
00:09:44,424 --> 00:09:47,502
I have all the transfer evidence.

119
00:09:47,502 --> 00:09:49,420
Let's meet at the Office of the Consumer Protection Board.

120
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,445
And if you all don't feel troubled enough yet,

121
00:09:54,445 --> 00:09:56,844
I'm telling you now that...

122
00:09:56,844 --> 00:10:03,177
All the suppliers we agreed with for packaging 
 and shipping have canceled.

123
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,403
Why?

124
00:10:08,403 --> 00:10:11,831
Because you're all so unreliable!

125
00:10:11,831 --> 00:10:12,555
Huh?

126
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:14,312
I can see it now.

127
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:17,027
You'll have to sit here with back pain.

128
00:10:17,027 --> 00:10:18,880
Packing and shipping yourselves.

129
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,328
Oh, sh*t!

130
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,727
We have to pack the orders ourselves?

131
00:10:21,727 --> 00:10:23,802
There are so many orders!

132
00:10:23,802 --> 00:10:25,518
What are we going to do?

133
00:10:25,518 --> 00:10:27,203
Oh  my  god.

134
00:10:27,203 --> 00:10:29,589
This is a logistic nightmare.

135
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:31,813
Everyone, calm down first.

136
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:34,728
I think we need to think this through slowly.

137
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,364
Hello.

138
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,779
I am Miss Akkimara Kampanat.

139
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:00,575
The owner of Unlimited Company.

140
00:11:00,575 --> 00:11:03,885
We would like to issue a statement apologizing to all customers.

141
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:08,279
Who ordered our chili paste.

142
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:13,200
Regarding all the drama, anger, and criticism directed 
 at our company.

143
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,600
I, as the company owner, take sole responsibility.

144
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,878
Plu.

145
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,371
The company encountered an issue regarding a misunderstanding.

146
00:11:24,371 --> 00:11:26,240
About the rental space.

147
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,480
This caused an error in our live stream chili paste sales.

148
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:39,200
Many customers confirmed their orders and made payments.

149
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,746
Which led to dissatisfaction and a lack of confidence.

150
00:11:42,746 --> 00:11:44,038
In our company's operational status.

151
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:46,287
The Unlimited Company.

152
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:51,124
We ask for our customers' continued trust and confidence.

153
00:11:51,124 --> 00:11:55,840
That our company has recorded all customer orders 
 systematically.

154
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,747
We will expedite the delivery of all ordered products.

155
00:11:57,747 --> 00:12:01,737
To our customers as soon as possible.

156
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,920
Back then, I wanted to go to work every day.

157
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,922
That's so sad.

158
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:26,691
There won't be days like that anymore.

159
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,007
Right?

160
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,591
Yes, yes. I apologize for this matter as well.

161
00:12:42,591 --> 00:12:44,482
Please calm down first.

162
00:12:44,482 --> 00:12:49,412
I will follow up on this and send the chili paste to you now.

163
00:12:49,412 --> 00:12:52,215
I apologize for the inconvenience.

164
00:12:52,215 --> 00:12:53,130
It tastes good, right?
