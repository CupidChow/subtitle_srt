1
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,867
Are you awake, partner?

2
00:00:51,867 --> 00:00:53,712
What did you just say?

3
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:58,600
I will handle the matter at that building and give it to you first.

4
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,861
So who is this friend of yours?

5
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:01,607
She's going to let me rent this building.

6
00:01:01,607 --> 00:01:03,181
I'm going to start a company.

7
00:01:04,217 --> 00:01:08,483
And right now, our company is hiring for all positions.

8
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:10,759
We just need you to have the right chemistry with us.

9
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:12,630
If you're up for it, let's meet!

10
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,483
Pine, what are you doing here?

11
00:01:18,483 --> 00:01:21,640
I'm a real customer.

12
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,608
Oh, that's perfect.

13
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,650
Yes, you've come here, that's right.

14
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,997
You can’t just leave it like this, okay?

15
00:01:40,997 --> 00:01:44,480
So, do you know what I'm going to hire you to do? 

16
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,295
Yes, quite so.

17
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:49,360
I still don't know.

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,831
So, we need to ask for more information.

19
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:55,899
We will expand our results and explore the possibilities.

20
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,316
Could you tell me what your boyfriend does for a living?

21
00:02:00,316 --> 00:02:05,230
Tikka, My girlfriend. She's a Persenal trainer.

22
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:08,143
It’s a bit boring.

23
00:02:08,143 --> 00:02:10,307
Because she has to go train clients at condominiums.

24
00:02:10,307 --> 00:02:12,231
and fitness centers. 

25
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:18,280
Actually, Tikka has quite a lot of followers and quite popular.

26
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,862
But...

27
00:02:21,862 --> 00:02:27,440
There is one thing that I'm still worried about.

28
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,174
A few days ago, Tikka always acts so weird.

29
00:02:40,387 --> 00:02:41,566
Let's eat.

30
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,177
When using her mobile phone, she always keeps her hand covered.

31
00:02:53,177 --> 00:02:56,155
It’s like she doesn’t want me to know what she’s still watching.

32
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:57,613
Tikka!

33
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,374
Eat it.

34
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,875
I’m so wondering if Tikka is hiding something from me.

35
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:26,651
Maybe she’s cheating on me and going out with a girl or a boy.

36
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:29,151
Going out with a boy? 

37
00:03:29,151 --> 00:03:32,799
So, does Tikka like both men and women?

38
00:03:33,985 --> 00:03:37,076
I smell something fishy about this.

39
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:41,240
So you're asking us to help you, right?

40
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:42,837
Yes.

41
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,994
This is the first job of the Unlimited Company.

42
00:03:50,986 --> 00:03:55,464
The point is, we need to investigate an affair.

43
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:59,578
But we don’t know the gender of the other person.

44
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,279
Are you having fun?

45
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,657
Oh, Wow!

46
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:03,199
So beautiful, it really motivates me to work!

47
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,335
Why are there so many girls here?

48
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,050
Don't tell me you're going to sell it.

49
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,080
If there're selling, I'll buy it myself.

50
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,609
Oh, It's that dressed up for a job interview.

51
00:05:32,609 --> 00:05:33,901
Or going to see Mor Lam (Northeastern style singer)

52
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,101
Is this going to work?

53
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:39,880
I'm looking for someone to work, not audition stars.

54
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,000
That's fun.

55
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,572
But we need to help each other stay focused.

56
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:45,617
Let's choose together.

57
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,523
Okay.

58
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,588
Our life has been quite boring lately.

59
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,195
I have to get this job somehow.

60
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,480
Wow, I wish i have 50% of your confidents.

61
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,751
OMG, it's fu*king hot.

62
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,727
Aren't you hot?

63
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,417
It's taking so long, isn't it?

64
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,311
You can take off your hat first.

65
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:35,432
No problem, I can handle it.

66
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,945
Aunt Lam yai is from the South?

67
00:06:37,945 --> 00:06:41,270
No problem, I can handle it.

68
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,000
No problem, I can handle it.?

69
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,120
Ms. Vannaphrav, please.

70
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,730
She has good manners.

71
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,302
Hello, I'm Wow Vannaphrav.

72
00:07:22,302 --> 00:07:24,233
My nickname is Wow.

73
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:27,039
I have graduated from the faculty of...

74
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,112
The shirt is really beautiful.

75
00:07:29,112 --> 00:07:30,882
Really?

76
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,082
Excuse me, Wow.

77
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,480
We're looking at the cutting and materials.

78
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,077
It seems to be a high-end brand.

79
00:07:39,077 --> 00:07:41,180
The price of this item is definitely not less than 10,000 baht.

80
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,044
850 baht.

81
00:07:44,044 --> 00:07:45,080
Huh!

82
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,111
Is this a shirt or poop?

83
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,696
This is a shirt, not poop.

84
00:07:55,696 --> 00:07:59,043
So, which store did you buy it from?

85
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,908
How about you give me a chance to work first?

86
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:10,297
I'll tell you which store it is, or I can even take you there.

87
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:12,730
Or I can even take you there.

88
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,435
Are you kidding?

89
00:08:15,435 --> 00:08:17,240
Just only 850 Baht.

90
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,360
Actually, I don't like to lie. It’s against my morals.

91
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,781
Oh!

92
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,919
Hey, what's this stain? I didn't even get a chance to look at it!

93
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,800
I’m really having bad luck today.

94
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,313
A stain like this definitely won’t come out.

95
00:08:48,313 --> 00:08:51,280
Well, it’s so small, no one will notice.

96
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,198
Even though someone sees it.

97
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:54,812
No one will care about it.

98
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,040
It seems like you really don't understand the heart of a woman.

99
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,540
Huh?

100
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:05,548
As a woman, wearing clothes with stains like this.

101
00:09:05,548 --> 00:09:08,407
Is considered a very big deal.

102
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,612
Really?

103
00:09:09,612 --> 00:09:11,687
A shirt that is dirty.

104
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:20,000
There are some flaws, but the price is 2,500 baht.

105
00:09:20,572 --> 00:09:28,800
It's a pity that I got to meet you and see this beautiful shirt.

106
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,087
But I guess I'll just have to try it on.

107
00:09:32,087 --> 00:09:37,760
I hope you find someone who really suits it. 

108
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:41,763
Uh...

109
00:09:41,763 --> 00:09:43,306
Just 850 baht.

110
00:09:43,878 --> 00:09:45,880
I will cut down the price for you.

111
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,758
Really?

112
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:50,920
Thank you very much.

113
00:09:55,107 --> 00:09:59,360
You're so awesome.

114
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,237
I really like it.

115
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,303
You like this shirt?

116
00:10:06,303 --> 00:10:07,861
I'm like Wow.

117
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:08,959
Hey!

118
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,000
What are you talking about? 

119
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,856
What?

120
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:16,212
I mean, She has a way of negotiating with the seller.

121
00:10:16,212 --> 00:10:19,272
And she doesn’t spend money recklessly. I think it’s okay.

122
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,952
Okay.

123
00:10:24,182 --> 00:10:26,954
Joice likes people like this.

124
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:29,214
Hmm.

125
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:32,076
I hope you two are a good match.

126
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:33,389
Shut up.

127
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,216
So, does Wow have any catchphrase or motto?

128
00:10:40,216 --> 00:10:42,969
Yes, I have.

129
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:45,166
is...

130
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:53,184
I would rather die than say a bad word.

131
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:56,066
Oh, sh*t!

132
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,635
Hi, I'm Greece.

133
00:11:07,635 --> 00:11:11,448
My full name is Athena Ngyi.

134
00:11:11,448 --> 00:11:14,443
Ngyi?
