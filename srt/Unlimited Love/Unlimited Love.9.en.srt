1
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,254
I'm so sorry.

2
00:00:50,254 --> 00:00:52,678
About how I misunderstood you.

3
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:55,272
I have something to show you.

4
00:00:55,272 --> 00:00:57,552
Is Ray lying to us?

5
00:00:57,552 --> 00:00:59,359
I will handle it myself.

6
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,719
How is Ray involved with this house?

7
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,608
It's so bad it could ruin his life.

8
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:12,330
He must have bad karma to atone for in this life.

9
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,676
I just listened to you sing, and it wasn't enough for me.

10
00:01:21,676 --> 00:01:23,600
Can I sing with you?

11
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,630
Um.

12
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,087
So, why would I turn you down now?

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,960
Let's sing together.

14
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,348
Wow.

15
00:02:55,348 --> 00:03:00,638
I'm sorry about that day.

16
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,748
Please don't be mad at me.

17
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:07,773
If you just want to be friends with me.

18
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:09,561
We can be friends.

19
00:03:09,561 --> 00:03:11,871
It's okay.

20
00:03:11,871 --> 00:03:16,640
Because today, I'm so f*cking happy.

21
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,319
Hey, did you really say that?

22
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,130
Why are you saying this?

23
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,692
This word is just nothing.

24
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,054
Really?

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,950
Do you have any other words?

26
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,669
Other words?

27
00:03:37,536 --> 00:03:38,388
Joice.

28
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:55,120
Did I just mishear that?

29
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,955
The event today was fantastic, wasn't it?

30
00:04:40,955 --> 00:04:43,711
We can definitely call this a success.

31
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,591
The customers also liked this event.

32
00:04:45,591 --> 00:04:48,754
And Jea Fahm also met her long lost mother again.

33
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,606
Yes, that's it.

34
00:04:52,606 --> 00:04:54,632
Today, everyone did a great job.

35
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:58,059
Everyone dedicated themselves fully.

36
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:01,835
I want our company to continue to grow.

37
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,312
I think...

38
00:05:21,312 --> 00:05:23,052
Are you hiding something about the building from me?

39
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,735
Why are you asking that question?

40
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,637
I know all about it.

41
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:58,160
Do you think I'm such a bad person?

42
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,655
If that's not it, then what's the truth?

43
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,870
My aunt used to tell me she would bequeath this building to me.

44
00:06:10,693 --> 00:06:13,841
Because I'm the only one who always took care of her.

45
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:21,747
Until Ryu came back and said that all the assets must go to the sole heir.

46
00:06:22,957 --> 00:06:27,355
So you never thought about telling us the truth?

47
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:29,149
Or did you think we wouldn't know,

48
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:30,614
And you could keep using us like this?

49
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:32,907
Calm down, Plu.

50
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,254
I have no idea what to do.

51
00:06:37,254 --> 00:06:38,937
I'm stressed too.

52
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:42,417
I truly didn't mean to lie to you.

53
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:45,096
I'm currently trying to fight for my own rights as well.

54
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:48,036
It's just that I don't have the testament.

55
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:48,756
Ray.

56
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:53,130
I know what's going on.

57
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,640
Do you think I'll let you lie to me and deceive me again?

58
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,066
Please trust me.

59
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:01,673
Please give me a chance.

60
00:07:01,673 --> 00:07:06,301
I'll handle everything without bothering anyone.

61
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,210
Please

62
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,991
Give me a chance.

63
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,455
Thank you.

64
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,393
I saw you all on TikTok.

65
00:07:44,393 --> 00:07:46,732
My employees showed me.

66
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,319
And they also says that you are number one.

67
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:58,593
And they also says that you are number one.

68
00:07:58,593 --> 00:08:05,833
But now that I've met you, I'm not feeling so confident about this.

69
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:06,806
I'm not sure.

70
00:08:06,806 --> 00:08:11,419
If you have enough potential to make my work successful.

71
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,360
Absolutely! We're already good at sales work.

72
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:25,199
Make sure your work is as good as what you say.

73
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,172
Don't worry.

74
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:32,017
We will present your products.

75
00:08:32,017 --> 00:08:33,740
Excellently and to the best of our abilities.

76
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:39,240
The sales figures will surely be satisfactory as well.

77
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,356
Anyway, you should go think of ways to make.

78
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:50,769
My chili paste presentation creative and appealing.

79
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:53,275
Let me tell you something.

80
00:08:53,275 --> 00:08:58,765
My chili paste is quality product.

81
00:08:58,765 --> 00:09:03,861
More importantly, I've already paid you guys fully. 

82
00:09:03,981 --> 00:09:08,694
Your job is to livestream and sell my chili paste.

83
00:09:08,694 --> 00:09:11,807
Until you reach 10 million baht in sales.

84
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,690
Because if you can't do it.

85
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,575
I will complain about you.

86
00:09:16,575 --> 00:09:18,939
And tell everyone not to hire your company.

87
00:09:18,939 --> 00:09:23,137
I'll tell everyone that you talk the talk, but can't walk the walk.

88
00:09:27,628 --> 00:09:32,119
Ms. Yingsri is our new customer.

89
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:35,001
And she explicitly asked for our team to handle the job.

90
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:38,339
What product is it that she had to request our team only?

91
00:09:39,381 --> 00:09:41,598
I really want to know!
