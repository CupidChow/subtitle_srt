1
00:01:20,683 --> 00:01:22,520
Pine, what are you doing here?

2
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,287
I think Tiga’s hiding something…

3
00:01:25,287 --> 00:01:28,140
maybe he’s seeing another girl

4
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,255
We need to investigate the affair.

5
00:01:31,877 --> 00:01:34,770
Today, we’re assigning who does what!

6
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,842
Go show him how gorgeous you are! Move!!!

7
00:01:41,097 --> 00:01:42,475
Oh my gosh, you!!!

8
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,988
Are you okay?

9
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,614
I’m fine.

10
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,651
Ugh, that’s way too cute!

11
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,827
"Alright, stop shipping them already!

12
00:02:05,827 --> 00:02:06,874
Are you crazy?!

13
00:02:07,214 --> 00:02:08,141
No Way!!!

14
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,570
Oh, is this your first time working out?

15
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:18,225
Yeah

16
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:24,524
You’ve got a really nice figure though

17
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:34,064
Can I get your number?

18
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:34,995
Huh?

19
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,333
I already added my Line

20
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:58,928
Wait, are you flirting with me?

21
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,321
A bit too little muscle for your height

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,374
A body like this

23
00:03:32,104 --> 00:03:35,218
Don’t you want to be a model, athlete

24
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:36,753
or maybe in a girl group

25
00:03:36,753 --> 00:03:38,902
You can message me anytime

26
00:03:41,864 --> 00:03:43,494
Hit me up on Line

27
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,881
Coffee is ready

28
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,276
Yes

29
00:03:56,156 --> 00:03:57,170
thank you

30
00:04:02,362 --> 00:04:03,278
Message me

31
00:04:03,278 --> 00:04:04,182
See you later

32
00:04:04,182 --> 00:04:05,784
I’ll train you quickly

33
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,704
Can I handle this?

34
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:27,771
You’ll be fine

35
00:04:28,608 --> 00:04:30,532
We trust our judgment,

36
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,148
just like with Plu You can do it

37
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,790
we’ll take it slow and help each other along

38
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,278
I can’t believe it

39
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,043
a tiny girl with a 21-inch waist

40
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:45,744
21, are you sure???

41
00:04:49,671 --> 00:04:53,050
A 26-inch waist works too, like mine

42
00:04:53,522 --> 00:04:55,812
Starting a company like this

43
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:58,517
not sure if it’s lucky or unlucky

44
00:04:58,517 --> 00:04:59,817
That we met someone like Ray

45
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:01,599
Oh, it’s lucky

46
00:05:02,821 --> 00:05:04,299
With me around, what’s there to be afraid of

47
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,803
I can’t keep working with you, Ray?

48
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:13,574
I love you

49
00:05:14,218 --> 00:05:16,760
I really don’t know where else to find a job

50
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,927
Please help me, please, please, please

51
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:23,725
I want to help you, but I’m barely managing myself

52
00:05:31,075 --> 00:05:34,835
Let’s do this, I hope the two of us get new jobs soon

53
00:05:39,748 --> 00:05:42,699
So rich, covered head to toe in designer brands

54
00:05:42,788 --> 00:05:44,788
Seriously, this much

55
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:46,352
I have a job interview today

56
00:05:46,674 --> 00:05:48,498
So I dressed up a bit to look respectable

57
00:05:49,077 --> 00:05:52,391
Also to show respect for the place

58
00:05:52,863 --> 00:05:53,968
Not just a little though

59
00:05:53,968 --> 00:05:55,347
with the outfit and bag

60
00:05:55,347 --> 00:05:57,207
how much should the salary be to make it worth it

61
00:05:58,044 --> 00:06:00,335
Maybe 200,000… 300,000

62
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,399
Our company is small

63
00:06:03,742 --> 00:06:05,241
we probably can’t afford to hire you

64
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:08,493
Don’t decide just yet

65
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:10,110
I love working

66
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:13,935
Salary isn’t an issue, whatever the company thinks is fair

67
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:17,582
Looks like she was into school activities

68
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,274
too back in the day

69
00:06:19,467 --> 00:06:20,515
She was a cheerleader

70
00:06:20,515 --> 00:06:21,284
drum major

71
00:06:21,284 --> 00:06:23,225
held signs, carried offerings for Teacher’s Day

72
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:26,435
All activities for pretty people

73
00:06:27,165 --> 00:06:29,223
Can’t argue with that

74
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,159
Pretty but not smart

75
00:06:38,657 --> 00:06:40,412
you even ran her own coffee shop

76
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:45,926
Now looking for a job like this, must have failed

77
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:52,543
Sweet, flirty smile, probably used it to get her way

78
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:53,294
too many times

79
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:55,861
Probably thinks we’ll fall for her charm

80
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,000
Pretty but no brains…

81
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,730
Don’t worry, I’m not good just at smiling

82
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:19,115
I’m not worried

83
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:20,828
and you don’t need to worry about me either

84
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:23,515
Alright, we’ll get back to you then

85
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:26,984
Okay

86
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:29,612
Thank You

87
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,298
Are you misunderstanding something

88
00:08:14,092 --> 00:08:16,980
Because I really kicked you full force

89
00:08:24,082 --> 00:08:25,425
Is that the person in the video??

90
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:27,998
You better stop lying right now!!

91
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,006
Yeah, it’s true

92
00:08:36,006 --> 00:08:37,272
Why would you do that

93
00:08:41,971 --> 00:08:47,025
Calm down, boss, hear me out, you idiot

94
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,319
Sorry

95
00:09:06,736 --> 00:09:08,729
This is actually my spot

96
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:12,424
I reserved it, but I went to the bathroom

97
00:09:16,007 --> 00:09:17,811
What a crappy day

98
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:23,294
Sorry, I can go somewhere else

99
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:26,288
Wait, no, we can stay here together

100
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,517
Jin, I’m calling

101
00:09:54,364 --> 00:09:55,047
Hey

102
00:09:55,884 --> 00:09:56,548
Hi Jin

103
00:09:56,784 --> 00:09:58,369
Jin Tidy Wolf

104
00:09:58,841 --> 00:10:02,841
Hi everyone, the air feels cold, isn’t it annoying?

105
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:06,238
It’s definitely more fun outside

106
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,257
Oh my god Wolf

107
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:13,295
seriously????

108
00:10:13,295 --> 00:10:15,325
Your s on planet

109
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,733
Whoa

110
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:22,764
What is this, I feel like my heart is gonna explode

111
00:10:23,086 --> 00:10:25,649
Tidy told me to wear it to flirt with Tiga

112
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:27,949
For what…

113
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:32,552
To see if Tiga is really a player like Pine said

114
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,498
I don’t know if Tiga likes it

115
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:36,669
but he’s got me, I like you

116
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:39,796
Any turn out that

117
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:43,987
Tiga stared at Wolf like he wanted to eat him

118
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,424
Really

119
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,126
Message me on Line

120
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:03,196
Tiga looked at Wolf like a lizard

121
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,860
She just wants him as a client

122
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,891
you didn’t say anything wrong, right???

123
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:15,779
Even with Wolf being this hot, she’s still not interested ??

124
00:11:18,182 --> 00:11:20,726
If Tiga actually likes Wolf

125
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,333
That will be chaos

126
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,090
Alright, just calling to update

127
00:11:28,592 --> 00:11:29,702
We gonna go follow up with Tiga

128
00:11:29,874 --> 00:11:33,533
Mm, bye bye, good luck

129
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,849
Love???

130
00:11:38,522 --> 00:11:42,495
It's mean Love

131
00:11:48,946 --> 00:11:49,659
Love?

132
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,281
Hug him???

133
00:11:56,903 --> 00:11:58,857
Wait, does Tiga like this kind of thing?

134
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:02,974
Hugging for business

135
00:12:03,661 --> 00:12:04,824
or maybe he’s just training

136
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:05,565
as part of a workout

137
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,557
Getting this close

138
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:10,873
No wonder the trainee got so hooked
