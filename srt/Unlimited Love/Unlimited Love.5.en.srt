1
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,778
We have a lot of job requests contacting us for work.

2
00:01:20,778 --> 00:01:24,230
But the most urgent job is...

3
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,100
This person’s name is Palm.

4
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,333
Palm is so kind, she considers the servants as family.

5
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:33,340
Is that a face or the skin of a frog?

6
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:38,095
We have to adjust the look of Lychee to beat the Bully word. 

7
00:01:38,095 --> 00:01:41,479
One.

8
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,672
Two.

9
00:01:42,672 --> 00:01:43,879
You can do it.

10
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,870
Mom, the girl from the unlimited company.

11
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,466
That you watched with me the other day.

12
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:03,176
Mom, the girl from the unlimited company.

13
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,298
Ms. Lam,  She is the mother of my girlfriend.

14
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:19,322
She was shocked since Luka and Ching

15
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,407
Luka, come on.

16
00:02:24,407 --> 00:02:25,120
Luka.

17
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,928
We raised the Ching to grow up with Luka.

18
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:31,280
We love both of them, as if they were my child.

19
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,615
We only do work and don't have much time to take care of them.

20
00:02:34,615 --> 00:02:36,160
My son grew up with a tablet.

21
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,503
Let's go play a game.

22
00:02:37,503 --> 00:02:38,181
Sigh.

23
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:39,421
Don't be a noob!

24
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:43,175
Ching likes to speak the weird language of Gen Alpha kids.

25
00:02:43,175 --> 00:02:44,341
Who love playing games

26
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:47,506
Luka.

27
00:02:47,506 --> 00:02:48,102
Crouch down now!

28
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:50,962
Why are you so stubborn?

29
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,801
She lives out of town.

30
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,156
and she only gets to see Ching once in a while.

31
00:02:58,156 --> 00:02:59,749
Grandma and my son love each other very much.

32
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:04,200
He went to pick up grandma to surprise ching.

33
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,858
Look, who's coming?

34
00:03:05,858 --> 00:03:08,686
Look, who’s here to see you?

35
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:11,035
I miss Grandma so much.

36
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:13,612
I want to go see you.

37
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:15,235
I will hug grandma right now.

38
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:18,114
What does it mean?

39
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,172
Give me a hug.

40
00:03:21,361 --> 00:03:24,451
Aah!

41
00:03:26,601 --> 00:03:30,148
[Scream]

42
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,422
Since that day.

43
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:44,560
Grandma has been unresponsive, no longer conscious at all.

44
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,060
We feel so sorry for Grandma.

45
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,987
Since she found out that Luka and Ching passed away.

46
00:03:50,987 --> 00:03:53,043
She hasn't been aware of anything anymore.

47
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,612
Until the day she saw the surprise wedding clip from your company

48
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:04,086
We are very pleased.

49
00:04:04,086 --> 00:04:09,787
That Grandma saw our clip and still felt it for a moment.

50
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,000
Um.

51
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,184
What will both of you hire the unlimited company to do? 

52
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,903
Come on! You have so many friends here to support you.

53
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:39,447
So you have to keep fighting, okay?

54
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:43,245
Oh, don't be sleepy.

55
00:04:45,147 --> 00:04:48,007
Please make a sound together. Our lungs will expand.

56
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:49,289
Make a sound?

57
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:49,789
Yes.

58
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,899
Then what should I say?

59
00:04:52,398 --> 00:04:56,821
What about we call the coach's name?

60
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,719
Um, okay.

61
00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:00,637
So let's start.

62
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,332
Widen your stance and prepare to bend your knees.

63
00:05:06,332 --> 00:05:09,190
One, two, three and...

64
00:05:10,283 --> 00:05:15,199
Wolf.

65
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,285
Very good.

66
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:21,810
The second time.

67
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,617
We'll go to the next position.

68
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:25,363
Stand with your feet together.

69
00:05:25,363 --> 00:05:26,704
and lift your right leg at the same time, everyone.

70
00:05:26,704 --> 00:05:29,822
Wolf.

71
00:05:29,822 --> 00:05:31,302
Keep fighting!

72
00:05:31,302 --> 00:05:35,574
Wolf.

73
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,479
Wolf.

74
00:05:41,832 --> 00:05:45,928
Wolf.

75
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,684
What are they doing?

76
00:05:47,684 --> 00:05:52,700
You're all so heartless, why didn't anyone invite me?

77
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:56,597
Wolf.

78
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,160
Good.

79
00:05:59,182 --> 00:06:01,461
Excellent, everyone!

80
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,536
We'll go to the next position.

81
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:07,108
Let's set up the position.

82
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:11,911
Hey!

83
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,865
Hey!

84
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:16,659
Ray.

85
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:18,749
Ray.

86
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,560
She already fell asleep.

87
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,553
Ray.

88
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:30,239
Hey!

89
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,840
Hey.

90
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,683
Are you better now?

91
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:54,520
Here’s your water.

92
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,870
Do you need some water?

93
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,495
It's okay.

94
00:06:59,495 --> 00:07:00,898
Are you okay?

95
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:02,400
Go to the hospital?

96
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,099
It's okay. I'm just exhausted.

97
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:08,480
If some rest will make me feel better.

98
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:10,707
Can I go back and rest?

99
00:07:10,707 --> 00:07:13,176
Please, I'll take you there.

100
00:07:13,176 --> 00:07:14,636
It's okay.

101
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,757
Don't be stubborn.

102
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,212
Can you give me an inhaler?

103
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:49,440
Where did Lychee?

104
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,120
Oh!

105
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,139
She's studying right now, so how could she have disappeared?

106
00:07:55,114 --> 00:07:56,713
I'll find her.

107
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,676
Okay, let's take a break.

108
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,082
Alright everyone, let’s split up.

109
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,000
Mafai.

110
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,733
I have something to discuss with you.

111
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:19,342
Whoa!

112
00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:21,315
Come on! 

113
00:08:21,315 --> 00:08:26,479
I stick my nose in other people's business like it's my job.

114
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,389
But don't tell anyone about this

115
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:32,412
If anyone finds out that it came from you.

116
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:33,882
I'll kill you.

117
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:35,720
Then don't tell, I don't want to know.

118
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,102
I'll tell you.

119
00:08:37,102 --> 00:08:38,891
No kill.

120
00:08:38,891 --> 00:08:39,880
But just crunch.

121
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,301
I'll listen to you.

122
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,717
About me and Tidy.

123
00:08:48,717 --> 00:08:50,381
On the day we went to find Tika.

124
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:52,900
I had to stay in a hotel with Tidy?

125
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:58,680
I'm drunk, but I know what I do.

126
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,351
You're not going to tell me that you two have something going on, are you?

127
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:02,920
she's finished.

128
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,215
Ooh!

129
00:09:05,215 --> 00:09:06,419
Speak quietly.

130
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,881
Tidy is secretly very sneaky.

131
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:11,873
She has already made all the plans.

132
00:09:11,873 --> 00:09:13,801
But I also knows.

133
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:15,966
I just followed along.

134
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:17,350
Really?

135
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,573
You get both work and friends.

136
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:23,064
That's cool.

137
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,093
I woke up this morning feeling so happy.

138
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:29,288
I planned that after finishing work.

139
00:09:29,288 --> 00:09:32,609
I would introduce to my office friends that I have a girlfriend now.

140
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,495
But Tidy said.

141
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,134
About last night.

142
00:09:40,134 --> 00:09:42,918
Don't think too much.

143
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,458
Do you think I'm full of resentment?

144
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,001
Whoa.

145
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,959
Why did Tidy do this to you?

146
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,572
She made you happy.

147
00:09:55,572 --> 00:09:57,572
Then you just got dumped like that.

148
00:09:57,572 --> 00:09:58,828
Whoa.

149
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,392
So, do you like it?

150
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,293
I really like it.

151
00:10:06,293 --> 00:10:07,235
Huh?

152
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,099
No, I don't like it.

153
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:13,170
Are you crazy?

154
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,833
So it doesn't matter at all.

155
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,298
You just stay away from Tidy. 

156
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:19,677
Only go to work with her.

157
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:23,550
Oh. I thinking about the work.

158
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:28,600
The homework you need to prepare to teach Lychee, is it finished?

159
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,322
I'm still confused.

160
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:31,274
How about you?

161
00:10:31,274 --> 00:10:33,437
I've prepared it.

162
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,365
It probably depends on Greece.

163
00:10:39,603 --> 00:10:42,254
"It probably depends on Greece"

164
00:10:42,254 --> 00:10:45,102
"It probably depends on Greece"

165
00:10:46,718 --> 00:10:49,601
Ow! When are you going to stop fighting?

166
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,815
Mom, let me feed you.

167
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:06,520
Hm.

168
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,577
This is the braised beef from that popular TikTok shop, right?

169
00:11:09,577 --> 00:11:10,802
That's the food I want to eat.

170
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,894
Yes, mom.

171
00:11:12,894 --> 00:11:16,165
Today, I passed the store.

172
00:11:16,165 --> 00:11:18,653
I jumped off the motorcycle to buy it for you first.

173
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,519
I rarely get out of the house, so I don't want to waste time.

174
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:25,800
You need to eat more, have some soup.

175
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,826
Soup, right?

176
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,297
Can you review this for me?

177
00:11:33,297 --> 00:11:35,693
Tell me how good this food is.

178
00:11:35,693 --> 00:11:42,361
The soup is fragrant, the meat is tender, and it's really delicious!

179
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:47,001
It's clean, just as expected from a legendary famous shop.

180
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:48,902
Wow, it's even tastier than I thought!

181
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,320
I'm glad you like it.

182
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,044
Have some more soup so your throat will feel better.

183
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,931
Ryu.

184
00:12:43,123 --> 00:12:45,425
I haven't seen you for a long time.

185
00:12:46,185 --> 00:12:48,253
You get more beautiful as you get older.

186
00:12:48,824 --> 00:12:51,543
Still seems harmless, same as before.

187
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,659
I'm happy to meet you again.

188
00:12:57,659 --> 00:12:59,389
Are you really happy?

189
00:13:03,793 --> 00:13:04,749
Fake.

190
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,757
Did she answer the phone?

191
00:13:17,571 --> 00:13:19,498
Oh, Why?

192
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,596
Oh, sh*t!

193
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:32,225
Ms. Palm called.

194
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:36,814
So, I'm not going to pick up the phone yet.
