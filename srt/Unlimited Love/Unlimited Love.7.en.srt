1
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,230
As for the first live stream of Lychee...

2
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,717
We've all seen how boring it was.

3
00:00:51,717 --> 00:00:57,286
We're feel that Lychee is not willing and agrees 100% 
 with this project.

4
00:00:57,286 --> 00:01:00,522
I would like to propose the second step of the plan.

5
00:01:00,522 --> 00:01:03,071
I brought you here today for a change of pace.

6
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:06,441
We're at the Tom Leng.

7
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,411
About Mom Lumyai and Lychee’s channel.

8
00:01:08,411 --> 00:01:09,881
It’s blowing up! Like, too good to handle!

9
00:01:09,881 --> 00:01:11,432
The ratings are going through the roof!

10
00:01:11,432 --> 00:01:13,362
When this one’s done and then we’ve got another lined up.

11
00:01:13,362 --> 00:01:15,760
We’ll have to head over to Grandma Lam’s place.

12
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,090
They want us to stage a fake spirit ceremony.

13
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,524
So Grandma can see them.

14
00:01:21,524 --> 00:01:24,253
Greece and Mafai should be suitable for this job.

15
00:01:24,253 --> 00:01:28,420
This work Greece and Mafai will surprise everyone.

16
00:01:54,477 --> 00:01:56,263
I acted possessed for the first time.

17
00:01:56,263 --> 00:01:58,262
I need time to get over it.

18
00:01:59,642 --> 00:02:01,483
Keep calm, Mafai.

19
00:02:01,483 --> 00:02:05,712
No matter what, we must play this part convincingly.

20
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:10,726
Ohio Hyo.

21
00:02:10,726 --> 00:02:11,556
Abnormal.

22
00:02:11,578 --> 00:02:12,281
Rizz

23
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:13,321
Charming.

24
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:14,348
Slay.

25
00:02:14,348 --> 00:02:15,105
That's cool.

26
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:15,625
Goat.

27
00:02:15,627 --> 00:02:16,530
Awesome.

28
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,371
Brain rot.

29
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:18,499
Brain rot from the internet.

30
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:19,463
Sigma.

31
00:02:19,463 --> 00:02:20,485
Really cool.

32
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,449
Cringe.

33
00:02:23,253 --> 00:02:24,688
Remember it.

34
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:26,487
This is the vocabulary used by Gen Z.

35
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:28,730
Hello.

36
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:30,197
My father.

37
00:02:30,197 --> 00:02:31,878
My mother.

38
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,583
My grandmother.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,621
How are you guys?

40
00:02:37,817 --> 00:02:38,879
Ching.

41
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:40,815
Ching, is that you?

42
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:43,194
Of course, Daddy.

43
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:44,476
I'm Ching.

44
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:50,124
Oh, my dear mom.

45
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:56,289
You look so much more beautiful, and that's without a filter.

46
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,391
Ching.

47
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,800
Go see your grandma.

48
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:09,283
Oh, my grandma.

49
00:03:10,763 --> 00:03:12,627
Grandma.

50
00:03:13,311 --> 00:03:16,077
I miss you so much.

51
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:17,505
Grandma.

52
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:19,012
I'm so excited.

53
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:21,083
Oh, my angel.

54
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:24,094
Is this Mr. Ching or Ms. Ching?

55
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:26,089
Why does he look quite feminine?

56
00:03:37,076 --> 00:03:43,716
I hope this project will be successful.

57
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:52,289
Hey guys, are you ready?

58
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:58,787
Honestly, not so much.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,044
Come on, don't worry.

60
00:04:02,044 --> 00:04:04,357
I've already coordinated with Uncle Naan.

61
00:04:04,373 --> 00:04:06,244
about the 'Long Korn' ceremony.

62
00:04:06,244 --> 00:04:08,181
He will come and guide you.

63
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,263
Don't worry.

64
00:04:26,305 --> 00:04:30,000
Why does Mafai look strange?

65
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:32,675
She looks like a dog.

66
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:45,864
Luka.

67
00:04:45,864 --> 00:04:48,204
Please, come to me.

68
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,307
Go see your grandma.

69
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:06,371
Grandma...

70
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:10,710
Hey, you guys, just enough.

71
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,846
Your acting is so fake.

72
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,618
How can my mom recover?

73
00:05:14,618 --> 00:05:16,736
It's so fake you can tell from a mile away.

74
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:35,353
[Scream]

75
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:37,801
Ching.

76
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:20,139
Grandma.

77
00:06:20,337 --> 00:06:22,112
Um...

78
00:06:26,524 --> 00:06:28,828
Ching for real.

79
00:06:28,828 --> 00:06:30,336
I really miss you.

80
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:33,056
Let's hug now.

81
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:38,054
Ching, come down here!

82
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:39,381
Come see who's here for you.

83
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:43,513
I miss you so much!

84
00:06:43,557 --> 00:06:45,638
I want to hug you right now.

85
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:55,426
What's going on?

86
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:58,537
Let's hug.

87
00:07:03,109 --> 00:07:05,961
You're awake now.

88
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:11,949
Ching.

89
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:16,025
We haven't hugged yet.

90
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:18,170
You and Luka also came and passed away.

91
00:07:25,434 --> 00:07:27,420
It's okay.

92
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,659
The cycle of rebirth is basic.

93
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,768
If you miss me, just die and come to me.

94
00:07:33,768 --> 00:07:36,428
I'm not dead yet!

95
00:07:36,428 --> 00:07:38,905
So, live happily.

96
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:40,178
Don't worry.

97
00:07:40,178 --> 00:07:42,886
I'll take care of Luka.

98
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,558
Plu.

99
00:07:49,757 --> 00:07:51,170
Ray.

100
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,911
Mom.

101
00:08:04,538 --> 00:08:08,219
That thing I asked you to research about unicorn in Thailand.

102
00:08:08,678 --> 00:08:09,783
How is it?

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,297
I worked on this all night.

104
00:08:12,297 --> 00:08:13,830
It might take a while to explain.

105
00:08:13,852 --> 00:08:15,992
I included comparisons between Thailand and other countries too.

106
00:08:15,993 --> 00:08:17,597
Yeah.

107
00:08:19,736 --> 00:08:23,445
The unicorn is based on the Elasmotherium.

108
00:08:23,445 --> 00:08:25,903
From 2.6 million years ago.

109
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:28,697
Huh?

110
00:08:28,697 --> 00:08:34,616
The most famous unicorn cartoon in America is My Little Pony.

111
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:36,053
which started in 2010.

112
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:39,869
In Japan, the famous unicorn is the manga Unico.

113
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:43,504
which was even adapted into two anime films.

114
00:08:43,548 --> 00:08:48,305
And there are also unicorns in Thailand.

115
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:51,386
The Kirin which is a Himmapan creature.

116
00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:53,726
That's a mix of horse, dragon, deer, and fish

117
00:08:53,748 --> 00:08:56,752
But in some legends, it only has one horn on its head.

118
00:08:56,752 --> 00:08:58,531
Which is why it's called a unicorn.

119
00:09:02,002 --> 00:09:03,813
You're really stupid, like a buffalo.

120
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:07,360
Not a buffalo.

121
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,604
Buffalo has two horns.

122
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:13,245
But the unicorn has only one horn, like this.

123
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:15,967
No, no, no.

124
00:09:16,481 --> 00:09:17,951
You!

125
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:26,345
You're so stupid!

126
00:09:27,989 --> 00:09:32,067
The unicorn I asked you to find is a startup company.

127
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:34,667
Valued at over one billion USD.

128
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:35,704
It's not...

129
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,792
That's not what you're showing me right now.

130
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:44,903
I'm so sorry.

131
00:09:45,282 --> 00:09:46,548
You know what?

132
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:57,880
You are lucky to have a boss who is both handsome and capable.

133
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:02,124
Everyone wants to work with me.

134
00:10:03,063 --> 00:10:04,374
Sorry.

135
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,701
Stop saying sorry.

136
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:09,178
And listen to me only.

137
00:10:09,178 --> 00:10:10,698
I'll tell you.

138
00:10:11,397 --> 00:10:13,201
Everyone is jealous of you.

139
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:15,838
And why did you do this?

140
00:10:15,838 --> 00:10:17,451
What were you thinking?

141
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,513
Did you use your feet to think?

142
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:19,901
Go.

143
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:23,160
Go find new information.

144
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,444
Go find new information!

145
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,291
If Plu were still here.

146
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:40,204
I wouldn't have to deal with something like this.

147
00:10:43,896 --> 00:10:49,760
Both handsome and capable, worth working with.

148
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,824
Hmm, only Him thinks that way.

149
00:10:51,824 --> 00:10:54,640
The Ms. Mafia thinks so too.

150
00:10:56,348 --> 00:11:00,197
The Mafia Boss sees everything he does as good.

151
00:11:00,197 --> 00:11:01,520
When Plu resigned.

152
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:04,295
Those two just assumed Plu had problems.

153
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:06,321
And imagined she was being sexually harassed.

154
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:10,590
I don't know how stupid, deaf, and blind a person has to be.

155
00:11:10,745 --> 00:11:12,871
to trust someone like Karj.

156
00:11:13,124 --> 00:11:15,129
Does the Mafia Boss not know.

157
00:11:15,328 --> 00:11:17,598
that all the employees badmouth her behind her back.

158
00:11:17,598 --> 00:11:19,221
She only thinks of complicated things.

159
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:20,904
And has no idea how to handle.

160
00:11:20,904 --> 00:11:24,104
Then pressures the employees to do a perfect job.

161
00:11:24,104 --> 00:11:26,771
It would be better if we had someone like Plu.

162
00:11:27,664 --> 00:11:29,645
You should worry about yourself, not Plu.

163
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:31,704
That we have to stay here.

164
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:33,508
Yeah, I struggle every day.

165
00:11:33,508 --> 00:11:36,904
Consider this a celebration for the completed
 Grandma Lam project.

166
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:39,386
I think it's better than expected.

167
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:48,962
But now, we need to brainstorm ways to make money.
