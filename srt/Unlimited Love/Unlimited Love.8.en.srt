1
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:52,165
We'll split into teams, and then discuss what kind of content 
 each team.

2
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:54,556
We'd like to ask you to take a video of some lifestyle content.

3
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:56,074
and sing.

4
00:00:56,074 --> 00:00:58,897
Leave me alone, please!

5
00:00:58,897 --> 00:01:02,949
If we chose Fahham as the provincial representative.

6
00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:06,119
We'd just be embarrassing ourselves, wouldn't we?

7
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,935
Well, I found out something about Ray.

8
00:01:09,935 --> 00:01:11,517
But I already warned Plu.

9
00:01:11,517 --> 00:01:13,106
She thinks I'm biased against Ray.

10
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:16,880
I think you look stressed lately.

11
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,345
Is everything okay?

12
00:01:19,515 --> 00:01:24,320
Everyone, today we're going to check out a hidden gem.

13
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,699
The new sensation in the industry.

14
00:01:35,484 --> 00:01:38,829
Oh, Jeh Fahm's group is amazing!

15
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:40,967
If you haven't watched it, you're totally missing out.

16
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:44,175
In the clip, two girls from Unlimited Company.

17
00:01:44,175 --> 00:01:46,946
Discovered the real Diva, Jeh Fahm.

18
00:01:46,946 --> 00:01:48,882
Who has a beautiful voice singing Thai folk song.

19
00:01:48,882 --> 00:01:52,343
Who was secretly working as a maid.

20
00:01:52,343 --> 00:01:54,747
And now she's gone totally viral!

21
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:57,585
Right now, influencers all across the industry.

22
00:01:57,585 --> 00:02:01,809
Are making lip-sync covers as Jeh Fahm.

23
00:02:01,809 --> 00:02:05,326
Let's see who didn't want to miss out on this trend!

24
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,505
I can't believe it.

25
00:02:07,505 --> 00:02:10,824
That Jeh Fahm's clip would go this viral and trendy!

26
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,640
Exactly. Let me check the feedback first.

27
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,226
Pine!

28
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:43,644
This is Ms. Luksong, isn't it?

29
00:02:43,644 --> 00:02:45,367
They're joining the trend too?

30
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:06,390
Ms. Lumyai is covering as Jeh Fahm as well?

31
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,160
Ms. Palm.

32
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,089
Ms. Lychee.

33
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:09,954
Ms. Lamyai.

34
00:03:09,954 --> 00:03:11,333
Are they covering everyone?

35
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:13,840
This song has a great beat! I can't stay still.

36
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,000
It's not just that I want to dance, I want to sing just like Jeh Fahm!

37
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,560
Her singing skills are amazing.

38
00:04:27,575 --> 00:04:30,770
Sachet, let's practice singing.

39
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:33,283
Get up.

40
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:36,000
Come on.

41
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,659
They said that if you want to sing technically well.

42
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:47,468
You have to control your throat muscles and your breathing.

43
00:04:47,468 --> 00:04:49,745
Right here?

44
00:04:49,745 --> 00:04:50,471
Yeah.

45
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:50,971
Okay.

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,011
Loei Dae...

47
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,388
You've got it! See?

48
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:05,532
Perfect!

49
00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:07,635
That's a beautiful voice, right?

50
00:05:10,054 --> 00:05:11,510
Listen to me.

51
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,928
If Jeh Fahm hears your voice

52
00:05:13,928 --> 00:05:15,998
she’s going to be worried.

53
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,933
You're really into this song.

54
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,841
Right?

55
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,033
Yes.

56
00:06:05,463 --> 00:06:10,468
Back then my mother and I enjoyed listening to 
 folk music together.

57
00:06:10,468 --> 00:06:14,313
But I don't care anymore.

58
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,497
Listening to folk music makes you miss your mother?

59
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,344
Then you should go home.

60
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:32,675
I can go with you.

61
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,468
You can hug me.

62
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:18,924
Ray.

63
00:07:19,652 --> 00:07:23,820
When I kissed you yesterday.

64
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,674
How did you feel?

65
00:07:35,035 --> 00:07:37,604
I shouldn't ask her that.

66
00:07:39,423 --> 00:07:41,385
It has to be cooler than this!

67
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,962
Ray.

68
00:07:44,962 --> 00:07:47,982
When I kissed you yesterday.

69
00:07:47,982 --> 00:07:49,995
Are you worried?

70
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,558
Ugh, I don't think that's right.

71
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:55,313
Let's try again.

72
00:07:55,313 --> 00:07:56,742
Don't think too much

73
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,000
Ray.

74
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,111
Why am I so overreacting?

75
00:08:14,111 --> 00:08:15,235
Don't overreact.

76
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:19,668
Ray.

77
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:24,390
When I kissed you yesterday.

78
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,044
Are you okay?

79
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,964
Yeah, I think this one works.

80
00:08:32,964 --> 00:08:36,770
Now, just wait and talk with her after she arrives.

81
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,935
Come on.

82
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:56,959
Keep fighting!

83
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:13,678
Ray.

84
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,719
Oh!

85
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:19,520
Give me a minute.

86
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,678
I have to take this call.

87
00:09:21,678 --> 00:09:22,908
I'll be back.

88
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,695
Yesterday when I...

89
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,844
Why is it different from practice?

90
00:09:45,697 --> 00:09:46,782
Sh*t!

91
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,767
Excuse me, I don't understand you at all.

92
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:09,068
You love singing this much, but when someone hires you.

93
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:10,835
Why don't you take the job?

94
00:10:10,835 --> 00:10:13,289
I'm just being humble.

95
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:15,903
I'm just a maid who looks like this.

96
00:10:15,903 --> 00:10:17,760
Who would want to watch me?

97
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,998
Come here, I'll give you a massage instead.

98
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,000
So soft!

99
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,467
That feels so soft.

100
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:33,037
Hey, Yim!

101
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:35,410
Do you think I'm old?

102
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:35,910
No.

103
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,704
Your body is as stiff as a rock.

104
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:42,415
The softness I mentioned was Mui's hands.

105
00:10:42,415 --> 00:10:43,724
Yim!

106
00:10:43,724 --> 00:10:44,912
You're exaggerating.

107
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:48,682
My hands are all calloused from work.

108
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,284
Show me, Let me touch.

109
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,304
Oh, My dearest Feh Fahm.

110
00:11:04,304 --> 00:11:05,578
Please take this job.

111
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:08,694
I'm literally facing you.

112
00:11:08,694 --> 00:11:12,660
I'm begging you, so many people need you right now.

113
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,009
Literally facing you.

114
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,304
What did you say?

115
00:11:16,304 --> 00:11:17,791
The lottery?

116
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,662
I don't know.

117
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:22,222
I'm begging you, please take this singing job.

118
00:11:22,222 --> 00:11:25,624
You're our company's only hope right now.

119
00:11:25,624 --> 00:11:29,435
Why are you making it so difficult just to accept a singing job?

120
00:11:30,371 --> 00:11:31,898
I'm so sorry.

121
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:36,095
Next time I will be more careful and try to use only Thai language.

122
00:11:38,058 --> 00:11:39,291
Oops. 

123
00:11:40,513 --> 00:11:42,179
I'm so sorry.

124
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:45,777
I will only speak Thai with you.

125
00:11:45,777 --> 00:11:48,694
Please come to my town.

126
00:11:54,986 --> 00:11:59,787
It's not that I don't want the job, but with a face like this.

127
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:02,480
they'd chase me off the stage.

128
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:07,670
Why should it be difficult?

129
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,998
Try to smile.

130
00:12:21,183 --> 00:12:22,189
Oh!

131
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:23,867
I can't do this.

132
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:25,815
I can't smile.

133
00:12:27,336 --> 00:12:29,085
Come on.

134
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:30,803
Let's try it.

135
00:12:30,803 --> 00:12:33,429
Try to smile.

136
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,244
Plu didn't believe me about Ray.

137
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,579
Plu said I had a bad impression of Ray.

138
00:12:53,243 --> 00:12:54,072
Why?

139
00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:57,270
Are my words that unreliable?

140
00:12:58,726 --> 00:12:59,679
Sh*t!

141
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,423
Sorry.

142
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:16,306
Sometimes, when you use impolite words.

143
00:13:16,306 --> 00:13:21,052
It can affect whether people believe you.

144
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,901
Are you trying to say I'm impolite?

145
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,713
Let me tell you something.

146
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:35,680
Even though I speak impolitely.

147
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,911
But I'm a sincere person.

148
00:13:37,911 --> 00:13:40,223
I've never deceived anyone.

149
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,165
I've never meant to hurt anyone.

150
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:43,782
I just say what's on my mind.

151
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:51,882
But what you say is very hard to understand.

152
00:13:51,882 --> 00:13:59,288
I can't figure out what you're thinking or feeling.

153
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,953
Oh!

154
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:12,251
Hey!

155
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,658
Are you okay?

156
00:14:13,658 --> 00:14:15,590
Let me see.

157
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,603
Is it hot?

158
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,979
Are you hurt?

159
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:44,143
Wow.

160
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:49,650
I really like you.

161
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,213
If you feel something.

162
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:07,406
If you think something.

163
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,759
Just say it and show it.

164
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,406
I like you too.

165
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:32,888
I'm happy to be working with you.

166
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,964
Just friends?

167
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,440
I think you don't like Ray and are prejudiced against her.

168
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,274
I thought you were going to frame her.

169
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,593
I'm such a terrible person.

170
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:17,447
Honestly, I don't have many friends in my life.
