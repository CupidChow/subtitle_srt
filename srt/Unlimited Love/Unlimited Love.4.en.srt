1
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,159
So, do you  have anything to want your company to help?

2
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,240
Can we have an internship?

3
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,245
Huh?

4
00:01:23,853 --> 00:01:25,000
Good.

5
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,093
Ah.

6
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:26,937
Good.

7
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:29,225
Uhu!

8
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,392
One day, she go to many places.

9
00:01:33,392 --> 00:01:35,110
Trains many people.

10
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,592
And is exhausted.

11
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:38,982
It's not surprising that she doesn't have time to go home. 

12
00:01:38,982 --> 00:01:42,204
Did she think too much by herself?

13
00:01:42,204 --> 00:01:44,174
Don't rush to conclusions.

14
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,756
I smell unfaithful people.

15
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,000
Don't order anything to drink?

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,366
I want to eat Jin.

17
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,292
Hey!

18
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,309
Jin.

19
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,778
So...

20
00:02:20,778 --> 00:02:23,929
I’ll say that last night.

21
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:26,936
Don’t think too much.

22
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,904
Yeah, I know.

23
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,720
I'm chill.

24
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,938
What do you think?

25
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:42,598
Ask yourself.

26
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,240
Everyone.

27
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,525
Don't be panic.

28
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,954
Sh*t!

29
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:09,625
Tidy must be afraid that everyone will be shocked.

30
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,760
So, She didn't dare to send this picture into the company group chat.

31
00:03:20,804 --> 00:03:24,026
Have Greece and Mafai gone to find out.

32
00:03:24,026 --> 00:03:26,192
Who the woman in the picture is? 

33
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,040
Not yet.

34
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,783
I've looked, and looked again, but I still don't know who she is.

35
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,143
I've been checking social media too, but it might take a little time.

36
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:49,710
What about Jin and Tidy?

37
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,155
Why is her car still parked in the same place?

38
00:04:01,155 --> 00:04:03,616
Oh, you must be really shocked.

39
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:05,881
Look, your car is still parked here.

40
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:09,250
Last night, Tika must have been really drunk.

41
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,745
That's why the car is still here, just like yours.

42
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:14,554
I remember now.

43
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,323
So, how did Tikka get home?

44
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:18,068
Did she take a taxi?

45
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,905
I've arrived at the car.

46
00:04:25,905 --> 00:04:29,505
Alright, I'll come to see you now.

47
00:04:34,549 --> 00:04:37,152
How is it? Did you get any more information?

48
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,432
I've been trying to dig up information.

49
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:42,375
But really is nothing.

50
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,478
And It's so frustrsting!

51
00:04:45,647 --> 00:04:48,095
And how do we know what the woman's name is?

52
00:04:48,095 --> 00:04:51,280
Try searching on Tika's Instagram.

53
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,485
But have no clue who she is.

54
00:04:54,485 --> 00:04:57,134
As for me, I took the picture to search and see.

55
00:04:57,134 --> 00:04:58,596
But I only found people with similar faces.

56
00:04:58,596 --> 00:05:01,909
I can't be sure if it's true, since she's acting like an ordinary person. 

57
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:03,382
How could I find any information?

58
00:05:03,382 --> 00:05:06,308
Hey, I'm so excited.

59
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:08,161
It's in a detective movie.

60
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:09,268
Sci-Fi movie.

61
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:13,303
Working in investigations requires careful attention

62
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:17,802
So, can I offer it like this?

63
00:05:18,158 --> 00:05:21,221
We try to send a picture to ask Ms. Pine.

64
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:22,834
That sounds fun!

65
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:24,199
Hey, no way!

66
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,618
Are you crazy?

67
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:29,218
If you send this picture, Pine will probably be shocked.

68
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:33,860
This picture is the last choice.

69
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,680
Next time, could you please speak more politely?

70
00:05:59,082 --> 00:06:02,400
I tried to contact Jin, but she didn't answer the phone.

71
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,360
I called Tidy, but she didn't answer either.

72
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:10,151
What does it mean?

73
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,480
I called Tidy, but she didn't answer either.

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,503
Maybe she's busy.

75
00:06:16,503 --> 00:06:18,492
Then, you should wait for her to get back to you.

76
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,860
Let me lock the house for a moment.

77
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,204
What are you doing?

78
00:06:41,204 --> 00:06:42,224
Follow me.

79
00:06:46,255 --> 00:06:47,242
Come down.

80
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:18,288
Greece called.

81
00:07:18,943 --> 00:07:20,661
Hey, she answered the call.

82
00:07:21,877 --> 00:07:23,238
Hello, Greece.

83
00:07:23,238 --> 00:07:24,800
We are following Tika.

84
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,360
Okay, Tidy.

85
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,718
That's  woman with Tika.

86
00:07:28,718 --> 00:07:30,718
So mysterious.

87
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:34,413
Do you have information that allows us to continue with each other?

88
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,130
Oh, I don't know.

89
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,361
I still don't know the name.

90
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:38,072
Wait.

91
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:41,094
I heard Tika mention a name.

92
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:44,425
When talking on the phone, Tika said that...

93
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:45,980
Tika said that...

94
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,440
I'm at the car now.

95
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,135
Huh?

96
00:07:51,823 --> 00:07:52,920
I'll come to see you.

97
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,544
Huh?

98
00:07:53,797 --> 00:07:56,240
Her name?

99
00:07:58,616 --> 00:07:59,680
Longkong.

100
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,442
Huh?

101
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:02,648
Really?

102
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,783
Yeah.

103
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,144
Tidy.

104
00:08:05,144 --> 00:08:07,759
Are you crazy? Who would have a name like Long Kong?

105
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,228
That's true.

106
00:08:09,228 --> 00:08:10,000
Ouch!

107
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,238
You’re still named Mafai.

108
00:08:12,238 --> 00:08:14,700
Is it the same species, right?

109
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,879
Hey!

110
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,641
Tidy.

111
00:08:21,641 --> 00:08:22,986
What's happening?

112
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:24,062
Oh!

113
00:08:24,062 --> 00:08:26,137
She has already disconnected.

114
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,966
What should we do?

115
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:31,246
Come on.

116
00:08:31,948 --> 00:08:34,440
Then, right now, what we can do to help.

117
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,720
Is find out who this woman is. 

118
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,165
I think her name is something like Aong Aong, right?

119
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:41,800
Or Croissant?

120
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,211
Oh, Yummy.

121
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:46,453
ชื่ออะไรเนี่ยอุ้ย

122
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,160
I checked the picture, the followers, and the people who liked it.

123
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,303
Even the stories of all the women that Tikka follows.

124
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,586
I still haven't found anyone who looks similar.

125
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:01,405
Um.

126
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,637
If she's Tika's ex.

127
00:09:05,637 --> 00:09:07,916
They shouldn't be following each other on Instagram, right? 

128
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:10,641
Yeah, that's true

129
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:12,999
And especially the exes, they're trouble.

130
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,598
What are you doing?

131
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:27,484
Try buying an app to see if it works.

132
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,509
I haven't seen Tika's face in weeks.

133
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,726
Still called a girlfriend?

134
00:09:49,504 --> 00:09:50,476
No!

135
00:09:50,476 --> 00:09:53,760
Hey, calm down. I'm just telling you.

136
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,219
You don't have to call her your girlfriend. You call her a bit*h Tika.

137
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:56,925
Ugh!

138
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:58,068
Yeah.

139
00:09:58,887 --> 00:10:02,460
And I'm already comfortable knowing that you’re over it.

140
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,917
I feel relieved.

141
00:10:04,595 --> 00:10:07,226
How could you say that to her?

142
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,546
Why are you saying this? Is there anything?

143
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,480
Ugh, no.

144
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,897
You have suspicions.

145
00:10:18,897 --> 00:10:19,880
Like this.

146
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,670
No.

147
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,266
Are you kidding me?

148
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:24,656
I really don't have it.

149
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:25,915
Look, you know, you have suspicions.

150
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:26,680
Who has suspicions?

151
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,288
You.

152
00:10:27,288 --> 00:10:27,788
No.

153
00:10:27,788 --> 00:10:28,476
I don't have

154
00:10:35,749 --> 00:10:40,475
I just talked to Jin and Tidy a moment ago.

155
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:45,378
Jin said that Tikka was talking on the phone with a woman.

156
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:49,330
But not sure what her name is.

157
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:54,320
It might be Long Kong or King Kong, something like that.

158
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,820
Huh?

159
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,801
Oh my god.

160
00:10:56,853 --> 00:11:03,137
If she's going with Kingkong, you guys just let her go.

161
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,601
What is this?

162
00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:06,561
Who sent the message?

163
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:07,116
Ugh!

164
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:12,908
Do you know the woman around Tika.

165
00:11:12,908 --> 00:11:18,649
Whose name is something like King King...?

166
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:20,313
Longkong.

167
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:23,296
Do you know the woman named Longkong?

168
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:25,827
What is the name?

169
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:27,725
How could that be? The name is Long Kong.

170
00:11:32,377 --> 00:11:35,000
But there is one person

171
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,026
Her name is.

172
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:50,534
is...

173
00:11:52,186 --> 00:11:53,718
is...

174
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,162
is...

175
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,080
Luksong.

176
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,000
Hm.

177
00:12:11,473 --> 00:12:12,621
Give me a hug.

178
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,551
Tika.

179
00:12:25,697 --> 00:12:29,681
When are you going to move in with me?

180
00:12:30,678 --> 00:12:31,675
The fastest.

181
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,000
As soon as I'm ready.

182
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:37,935
I'll move in with you.

183
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:40,682
I will break up with Pine decisively.

184
00:12:40,682 --> 00:12:41,501
Really?

185
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,000
Achoo!

186
00:13:01,885 --> 00:13:02,954
Oh!

187
00:13:02,954 --> 00:13:04,321
Bingo.

188
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,820
Hold on, don't get too excited yet.
