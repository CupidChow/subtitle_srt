00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:31,232
=The Maid=

2
00:01:31,232 --> 00:01:34,048
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,512
Wait.

4
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,960
Are you going back on your word?

5
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,240
I've injured you.

6
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,120
How can I shirk responsibility?

7
00:02:05,152 --> 00:02:06,080
Your Highness,

8
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,120
how should we handle them?

9
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,520
Killing one will warn the rest.

10
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,840
If I kill them all,

11
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,880
who would govern the realm
for the Pei family?

12
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,920
Your mercy is boundless.

13
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,800
- Thank you for sparing our lives.
- Thank you for sparing our lives.

14
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,600
Those officials grow
increasingly impertinent.

15
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,992
How dare they present

16
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,360
a courtesan to His Highness?

17
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,360
Given His Highness's exalted status,

18
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,560
those seeking his favor

19
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,040
will naturally employ every means.

20
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,840
His Highness' heart only belongs to you.

21
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,560
Among so many concubines here,

22
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,320
none last three months in the mansion.

23
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,600
Pitiful those ladies,

24
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,680
aspiring to the heavens,

25
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,960
yet fated to fall like paper.

26
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,360
They lack the fortune

27
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,800
to enjoy the Prince Regent's prosperity.

28
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,160
I'm fine.

29
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,400
I should go.

30
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,400
Should opportunity arise,

31
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,320
I'll perform for you again.

32
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,480
You schemed your way into my presence.

33
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,560
But now, you wish to leave.

34
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,680
In this world,

35
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,800
what woman doesn't yearn for you?

36
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,120
But,

37
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,240
one must stay alive
to enjoy such privileges.

38
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,040
You don't strike me as fearing death.

39
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,720
In your household,

40
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,880
there's not even a secondary consort.

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,560
Your concubines

42
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,760
either perished tragically

43
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,800
or vanished without trace.

44
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,040
You wish me to stay in the mansion.

45
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,200
But will you protect me?

46
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,600
With pure intentions,

47
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,680
you'll naturally survive.

48
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,840
But if harboring ulterior motives,

49
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,160
you'd best remain here briefly.

50
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
After recovering,

51
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,560
we'll decide your fate.

52
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,800
Such consideration from you

53
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,000
truly stirs

54
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,360
my heartstrings.

55
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,920
This must be the dancer
gracing us today.

56
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,160
Your beauty shines true.

57
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,400
You are?

58
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,920
Lady.

59
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,160
You can speak?

60
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,160
I'm Xiyan. Greetings, Your Highness.

61
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,680
Do you know Xiyan?

62
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,200
Lady Xiyan

63
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,920
resembles my late sister at home.

64
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,720
I just miss her.

65
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,040
Your current demeanor

66
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,200
seems less like remembrance,

67
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,680
but more like fear.

68
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,680
Seeing the dead seemingly resurrected,

69
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,480
I neglected decorum.

70
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,320
You must find it amusing.

71
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,800
Forgive me, Your Highness.

72
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,160
You've ever been graceful.

73
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,360
Ensure Xiyan receives proper care
these coming days.

74
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,360
Shen Yuqing,

75
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,520
cease this pretense.

76
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,200
Your current expression

77
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,640
makes me wonder

78
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,120
how that sister of yours truly died.

79
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,920
How could it make you tremble so?

80
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,080
Whether you're her

81
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,240
or not,

82
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,640
you share her fate,

83
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,360
worthy only to serve as a maid.

84
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,760
Don't presume ants
can shake mighty trees.

85
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,720
Your current demeanor

86
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,200
resembles that bristling Persian cat

87
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,080
from Meixiang House.

88
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,440
You...

89
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,960
I merely visit briefly,

90
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,720
yet you quake in terror?

91
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,560
Are you afraid your glory,

92
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,280
your exclusive favor,

93
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,160
and your power

94
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,000
will all be snatched away by me?

95
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,872
Que'nu,

96
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,920
escort her to the side chamber.

97
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,160
Attend her thoroughly.

98
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,240
Rest assured, Your Highness.

99
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,240
I will extend proper hospitality.

100
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,280
Get in!

101
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,080
In her days at the Duke's Mansion,

102
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,920
Shen Yuqing frequented
Yangque Garden most.

103
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,880
This side courtyard

104
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,640
is the closest resemblance
to Yangque Garden here.

105
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,160
Does it feel familiar to you?

106
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,280
If you can't recall,

107
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,000
let me refresh your memory.

108
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,760
Que'nu,

109
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,560
I am not some delicate young lady

110
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,640
to let a mere maid bully them.

111
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,480
Today,

112
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,320
I'll show you your place.

113
00:08:41,056 --> 00:08:41,722
You...

114
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:42,920
A household courtesan like you

115
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,200
dares to humiliate me?

116
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,560
Let me teach you today

117
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,680
how to talk to me properly.

118
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,240
Go report this to your master.

119
00:09:02,016 --> 00:09:03,104
(Don't worry.)

120
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,440
(I'll settle each score one by one.)

121
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,040
The aftermath has been handled.

122
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,760
These deceitful officials

123
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,880
colluded with foreign enemies

124
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,640
to orchestrate your downfall,

125
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,400
causing massive casualties in our army.

126
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,280
(Cheng Su, Chief Clerk)
The Empress Dowager orchestrated rumors.

127
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,440
Your reputation worsens by the day.

128
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,520
Empty prestige means nothing.

129
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,400
I need only their fear.

130
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,040
You claim no affection for Lady Xiyan,

131
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,600
yet you keep her in the mansion.

132
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,800
Is it because she doesn't fear you?

133
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,880
What makes you think I lack affection?

134
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm afraid the whole the capital knows

135
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,280
how deeply I favor her.

136
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,960
If you truly love someone,

137
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,160
you won't make her a public target.

138
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,360
The women in my mansion

139
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,040
were all eliminated by Shen Yuanjin.

140
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,880
Using substitutes on the wedding night.

141
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,360
Borrowing a womb for heirs.

142
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,520
It's time to curb the Princess Consort
and the Duke's Mansion.

143
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,760
Qingmei used to be the top courtesan
in Meixiang House.

144
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,160
I've never heard of Lady Xiyan before.

145
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,040
Her fragile appearance

146
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,600
hides cunning ambition.

147
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,040
Your Highness,

148
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,200
don't fall for her honeyed trap.

149
00:10:39,808 --> 00:10:40,800
Your Highness,

150
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,480
Xiyan can't be Shen Yuqing.

151
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,120
She showed no reaction
to Yangque Garden.

152
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,920
Shen Yuqing couldn't even meet my gaze.

153
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,200
A mere raised hand

154
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,360
would make her beg for mercy.

155
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,640
Three years have passed.

156
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,280
People change.

157
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,760
We can't confirm through mere words.

158
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,040
What if there were a way

159
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,680
to force her true confession...

160
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,120
Proceed as you suggest.

161
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,480
Whether she's Shen Yuqing or not,

162
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,480
I want that face gone from my sight.

163
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,760
(Why this sudden dizziness?)

164
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,640
Que'nu changed the incense?

165
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,240
(Qing,)

166
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,400
(run!)

167
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,960
(Qing.)

168
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,040
If you and the child escape,

169
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,800
I'll be free too.

170
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,400
Mother.

171
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,280
Mother.

172
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,320
Don't touch my mother.

173
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,520
Don't touch my mother.

174
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,200
I'll fight you to the death!

175
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,680
Don't touch my mother.

176
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,184
Stop.

177
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,592
Stop.

178
00:12:18,592 --> 00:12:19,480
Mother.

179
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,520
No one could escape my homeland's
heart-devouring incense.

180
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,000
You truly are Shen Yuqing.

181
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,120
Shen Yuqing,

182
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,880
today

183
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,720
will be your last day.

184
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,600
Zhao's been in the mountains
for over a month.

185
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,040
I want to bring him home.

186
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,520
A doting mother ruins the son.

187
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,680
Henceforth,

188
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,160
I'll discipline Zhao myself.

189
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,040
Winter approaches.

190
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,400
Why not move to my quarters?

191
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,440
Let me attend you nightly,

192
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,360
and ease the morning court duties.

193
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,960
No need for such exertion, my dear.

194
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,160
The Duke's Mansion needs you,

195
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,680
as you need it.

196
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,520
We are bound

197
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,520
for life.

198
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,680
Willful ignorance

199
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,960
preserves harmony.

200
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,000
Isn't it better?

201
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,840
The current state suits me.

202
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,720
(Music from the side courtyard?)

203
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,520
(A shameless woman
is always pretentious.)

204
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,040
(So restless even in madness.)

205
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,040
(This music...)

206
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,160
Tonight you'll either die
by Que'nu's hand,

207
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,480
or meet your end at Pei Ji's blade.
