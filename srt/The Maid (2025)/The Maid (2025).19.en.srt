00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:31,264
=The Maid=

2
00:01:31,412 --> 00:01:35,104
=Episode 19=

3
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,080
Father,

4
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,880
don't you recognize me now?

5
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,512
You...

6
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,144
You are...

7
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,480
That day, my mother

8
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,400
was beaten by you until she miscarried.

9
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,800
I was drugged mute.

10
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,240
For you,

11
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,840
my mother's life and mine

12
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,880
were even less valuable

13
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,240
than your trivial amusements.

14
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,680
(Who's your mother?)

15
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,360
Qin Xiaoniang.

16
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,640
That female physician?

17
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,080
Xiaoniang's carrying a child

18
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,400
in her womb.

19
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,200
Madam Su ordered her beaten to death.

20
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,000
Please save her.

21
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,040
That countryside woman

22
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,320
is lucky to die

23
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,560
under my roof.

24
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,040
Get lost.

25
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,920
Stop ruining my mood.

26
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,800
You're Yuqing?

27
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,200
My lord, this isn't your first brush

28
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,800
with death, huh?

29
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,760
If my mother hadn't saved you

30
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,040
from that cliff back then,

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,960
she wouldn't get raped by you.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,040
She'd never have entered
the Duke's Mansion.

33
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,080
She'd still be alive!

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,952
You

35
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,680
deserved death long ago.

36
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,360
Qing.

37
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,280
Please!

38
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,760
Save me!

39
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,920
I'll make it up to you!

40
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,280
My lord,

41
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
farewell.

42
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,720
(Mother,)

43
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,400
(I've finally made the culprit
atone for his sins.)

44
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,880
Thank you for your help.

45
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,120
No need for thanks.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,400
Without you,

47
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,040
I couldn't have avenged my husband.

48
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,480
That day, when you exposed

49
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,240
the Duchess's crime

50
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,240
in the worship hall,

51
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,240
you gave me hope.

52
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,640
The demoness has appeared.

53
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,880
Chaos descends.

54
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,560
You planted

55
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,280
these words

56
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,680
on Madam Su's corpse

57
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,520
and in the Duke's

58
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,240
arrogant schemes.

59
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,600
Excuse me.

60
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,800
Could you tell me

61
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,920
the way to Meixiang House?

62
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,424
That way.

63
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,760
Which way?

64
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,520
That way?

65
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,808
There.

66
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,840
(The demoness has appeared)
That way?

67
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,000
(Chaos descends)
I said that way!

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,400
You mean left?

69
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
It's over.

70
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,208
What

71
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,680
will you do now?

72
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,240
I will take monastic vows.

73
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,440
A life of devotion

74
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,400
amidst Buddha statues.

75
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,200
Sounds rather desolate.

76
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,960
That's not true.

77
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,000
These past years,

78
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,200
I've never felt

79
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,080
such relief until now.

80
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,320
Though my husband

81
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,640
rests beneath the earth,

82
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,880
he can finally rest in peace.

83
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,000
That brings me peace.

84
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,280
And you?

85
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,720
Me?

86
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,880
The storm on my path

87
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,320
has yet to subside.

88
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,512
Take care.

89
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,904
Wait.

90
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,400
This can't shield me from storms,

91
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,560
but it may warm you against the chill.

92
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,560
I remember

93
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,200
there were many figures in it.

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,936
Poorly rendered ones.

95
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,480
So I painted over them.

96
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,560
Might you

97
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,120
offer some advice?

98
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,640
Still refusing to be honest?

99
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,160
Is this your true purpose

100
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,320
for approaching me?

101
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,240
You understand me best.

102
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,000
My weaknesses,

103
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,000
pain,

104
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,968
and desire

105
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,440
are all in your hands.

106
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,280
I originally wanted
to wield you as a sword.

107
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,040
But in fact,

108
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,440
you are the one holding the sword.

109
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,800
How do you wish to deal with me?

110
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,360
Deal with?

111
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,840
With all your schemes,

112
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,960
you've finally made me fall for you.

113
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,600
I only want to hear the truth.

114
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,400
Slow down, Zhao.

115
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,560
Be careful, Zhao.

116
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,480
Don't fall down.

117
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,280
Isn't you perfectly aware

118
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,560
of who I really am?

119
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,720
Zhao regards Shen Yuanjin
as his birth mother.

120
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,320
I will never allow

121
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,400
Zhao to be harmed by anyone.

122
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,040
Ye Xiyan,

123
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,960
I don't care what you plan to do.

124
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,840
Stop this at once.

125
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,480
The masters on the mountain
are extraordinary.

126
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,160
(Pei Zhao, Heir of the Prince Regent)
Master Lin has peerless spear skills.

127
00:09:28,352 --> 00:09:30,640
Master Zhou wields sabers masterfully.

128
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,280
And...

129
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,520
Mother,

130
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,800
why are you ignoring me again?

131
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,000
What I miss most

132
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,280
is still you.

133
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,960
You indulge me in everything.

134
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,000
The masters never do.

135
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,080
Zhao,

136
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,480
I've raised you for three years.

137
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,760
Now it's time for you
to repay this kindness.

138
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,280
Master Zhao,

139
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,440
His Highness seeks you.

140
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,184
Are you insane?

141
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,630
His Highness cares most about Zhao.

142
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,280
If he discovers you're using Zhao,

143
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,840
he won't let you off easily.

144
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,800
Yes, I'm insane.

145
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,280
She caused both my mother
and father's deaths.

146
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,360
The Western Army isn't
under the Duke's control.

147
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,480
And the Empress Dowager
refuses to see me.

148
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,040
If I don't act soon,

149
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,720
I'll be the next to die.

150
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,200
So you'd drag

151
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,560
Zhao into this conflict?

152
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,400
We've worked hard to raise Zhao.

153
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,520
Do you think this doesn't pain me?

154
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,456
Changyi.

155
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,840
This is my only option left.

156
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,760
I would never harm Zhao.

157
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,440
All these years,

158
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,200
we three weren't a true family,

159
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,920
yet bound tighter than any kin.

160
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,680
Wasn't that good enough?

161
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,960
Don't you wish to return to those days?

162
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,120
What are you trying to do?

163
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,920
Abdication and yielding
to worthier candidates.

164
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,544
Qing,

165
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,000
you've won.

166
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,840
All affairs
of the Prince Regent's Mansion

167
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,440
shall be managed by you.

168
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,064
I'll return Zhao

169
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,600
to you too.

170
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,400
His Highness hasn't punished you.

171
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,600
Why go to such lengths?

172
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,240
I was wrong in the past.

173
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,960
For the rest of my life,

174
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,400
I'll chant scriptures before Buddha,

175
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,920
atoning to you and Qin Xiaoniang.

176
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,480
I only hope

177
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,880
you'll consider
how I treated Zhao as my own,

178
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,320
raising him with care,

179
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,080
and forgive me.

180
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,560
This is the swaddling clothes Zhao wore

181
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,600
when first brought back.

182
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,240
Such a tiny infant,

183
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,200
with feeble cries,

184
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,080
like a little kitten.

185
00:13:49,152 --> 00:13:51,040
At Zhao's first birthday,

186
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,280
he grabbed this wooden sword.

187
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,880
When Zhao first learned Luban locks,

188
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,440
he couldn't open them.

189
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,840
So he threw them angrily on the floor

190
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,560
and then picked them up,

191
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,040
trying learning slowly.

192
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,840
I have no interest
in raising another's child.

193
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,000
I know you hate me.

194
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,480
But Zhao has always seen me
as his mother.

195
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,200
If you kill me,

196
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,320
how will he view you

197
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,200
when he learns of it?

198
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,200
You should cultivate virtue.

199
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,160
Refrain from meddling
in worldly matters.

200
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,856
Hit you.

201
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,640
Who told you

202
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,440
to bring her steamed buns
and pickles daily?

203
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,000
I'll hit you.

204
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,960
I'll kill you!

205
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,104
Stop!

206
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,824
Stop!

207
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
You villain!

208
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,560
It was you!

209
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,520
You harmed my mother!

210
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,480
I'll hit you!

211
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,120
(Shen Yuanjin,)

212
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,320
(how dare you raise Zhao
to be so spoiled?)

213
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,960
How dare you harm me?

214
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,840
You can treat others this way,

215
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,990
and I'll treat you the same.

216
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,840
My father is the Prince Regent!

217
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,560
I'll have him kill you!

218
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,960
Prince Regent, huh?

219
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,440
Fine.

220
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,440
Let me show you

221
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,840
what the Prince Regent can do.

222
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,040
