=Episode 25=

3
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,224
Take it easy, Master Zhao.

4
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,920
I'll entrust Zhao to you.

5
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,480
Your Highness, what do you mean?

6
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,880
Though I don't know His Highness's plan,

7
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,920
I can't abandon him.

8
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,880
Your scheme

9
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,800
never included him.

10
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,600
Why do you

11
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,960
act this way now?

12
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,640
I've always been his blade.

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,320
I should face this with him.

14
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,304
Mother.

15
00:02:37,472 --> 00:02:38,848
Go, go!

16
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,720
(He wants to protect you,
the young master,)

17
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,600
(and this realm,)

18
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,480
(yet never himself.)

19
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,840
(These guards will serve him
with their lives.)

20
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,520
(Take them with you.)

21
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,160
(You may break the siege for him.)

22
00:03:37,248 --> 00:03:39,320
(Pei Ji, you liar.)

23
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,560
(You must wait for me.)

24
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,120
M-Mother.

25
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,040
Stop crying.

26
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,384
Watch closely.

27
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,120
Let them

28
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,560
fight to the death.

29
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,600
Only then can we

30
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,760
secure the throne.

31
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,632
Kill him!

32
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,040
Kill him now!

33
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,960
Even if you leave here,

34
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,280
you won't survive.

35
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,640
I never planned to leave.

36
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,360
Nor will you!

37
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,176
Pei Ji! Pei Ji!

38
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,920
Xiyan.

39
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,240
Xiyan!

40
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,360
Pei Ji!

41
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,280
The Western Army has fallen.

42
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,160
Open the door.

43
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,480
Don't come in!

44
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,880
Your Highness.

45
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,200
By my command,

46
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,800
no one

47
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,320
shall enter the main hall!

48
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,080
What are you doing?

49
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,040
Pei Ji,

50
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,400
what are you doing?

51
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,000
I want the people

52
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,920
to live in peace.

53
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,280
I want the court

54
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,640
to be just and harmonious.

55
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,720
I want this world

56
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,800
to know lasting tranquility.

57
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,160
Pei Ji!

58
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,480
Pei Ji, open the door!

59
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:33,320
P-Pei Ji!

60
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,040
Prince Regent.

61
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:37,504
You...

62
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,320
Don't kill me.

63
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,880
Don't you want the throne?

64
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,960
I'll have His Majesty decree

65
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,160
t-to abdicate in your favor.

66
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,600
When did I ever care

67
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,560
about the throne?

68
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,560
Then what do you want?

69
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,840
I'll give you everything.

70
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,600
Everything!

71
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,840
Mother...

72
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,680
I can finally avenge you.

73
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,280
Unless you die,

74
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,640
my wife and child will never

75
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,840
be safe.

76
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,880
Brother.

77
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
Mother.

78
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,280
Pei Ji!

79
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,920
Pei Ji, open the door!

80
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,400
Pei Ji!

81
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,072
Pei Ji.

82
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,640
Pei Ji!

83
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,320
Pei Ji!

84
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,560
Pei Ji.

85
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,912
Pei Ji.

86
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,576
Pei Ji.

87
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,790
Summon the physician.

88
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,976
Hurry, get the physician!

89
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,760
Why risk yourself alone?

90
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,640
Didn't we agree

91
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,520
to wait at the villa

92
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,680
for your return

93
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,960
and you'll bring us home?

94
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,440
So this is the moment

95
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,280
you finally show urgency.

96
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,440
For me?

97
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,440
We're both sorrowful souls.

98
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,880
I understand

99
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,600
your burdens.

100
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,840
At dusk,

101
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,840
I'd often watch from the study window

102
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,880
as you sat

103
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,320

104
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:20,600
gazing at the waterside pavilion.

105
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,520
Back then,

106
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,800
did you ever think of me?

107
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,960
I did.

108
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,120
Thought about how to use me?

109
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,440
At first, yes.

110
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,120
But later, not anymore.

111
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,600
When did it change?

112
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,632
