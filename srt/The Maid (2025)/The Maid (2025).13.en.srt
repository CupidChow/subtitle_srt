1
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:30,765
=The Maid=

2
00:01:31,297 --> 00:01:34,240
=Episode 13=

3
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,080
Shen Yuqing.

4
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,040
You killed Que'nu and Lin Jifu.

5
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,440
I thought you were a big deal.

6
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,720
Never imagined

7
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,320
you would try to fool me

8
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,320
with such a simple trick of the eyes.

9
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,000
Li Si.

10
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,560
As Chief Constable
of Capital Prefecture,

11
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,880
you willingly became
the Duchess's hound,

12
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,360
desecrating graves

13
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,600
and destroying corpses.

14
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,280
These are capital crimes.

15
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,720
Aren't you afraid

16
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,640
you'll die a horrible death?

17
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,560
What?

18
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,320
This isn't your mother's corpse?

19
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,160
If you were Shen Yuqing,

20
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,480
would you leave

21
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,880
your own mother's corpse here

22
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,120
to be manipulated?

23
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,000
You went through all this trouble.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,320
What's your real aim?

25
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,640
Madam Su is ruthless and sinister.

26
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,160
She shows neither mercy nor loyalty.

27
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,840
Yet you've served her faithfully
for years.

28
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,120
She must have dirt on you.

29
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,240
And you

30
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,360
must have kept an ace up your sleeve,

31
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,880
right?

32
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,120
Nonsense!

33
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,880
Madam Su's kindness to me is immense.

34
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,880
How could I betray her?

35
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,920
I'm the Prince Regent's favorite.

36
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,720
When His Highness rages,

37
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,400
many will die.

38
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,440
Madam Su and Shen Yuanjin

39
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,600
might survive his wrath.

40
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,760
But what about you?

41
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,080
Will you be killed by His Highness

42
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,360
or Madam Su?

43
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,040
I obstructed Shen Yuanjin.

44
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,920
Madam Su and I are locked
in mortal struggle.

45
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,960
We bear no grudge.

46
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,480
Give me Madam Su's secrets,

47
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,200
and I'll grant you 10,000 gold taels

48
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,440
to flee the capital forever.

49
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,240
Do I truly resemble

50
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,640
Shen Yuqing that much?

51
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,440
I killed Qin Xiaoniang

52
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,160
and captured her child.

53
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,840
If you were Shen Yuqing,

54
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,160
you wouldn't react like this.

55
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,080
What if...

56
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,880
Better to kill wrongly

57
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,520
than let escape.

58
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,680
This woman's cunning.

59
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,360
I nearly fell for her trap.

60
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,240
I am late.

61
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,520
I beg your punishment.

62
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,760
Captured suffices.

63
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,880
You should leave.

64
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,120
My lady,

65
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,280
haven't I always handled disposals?

66
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,440
I'll handle

67
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,040
her remains personally.

68
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,360
Understood.

69
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,090
My lady.

70
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,248
She offered 10,000 gold taels

71
00:05:29,248 --> 00:05:30,200
to help Li Si escape.

72
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,280
Li Si hesitated

73
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,640
and whispered closely with her.

74
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,040
I couldn't overhear details.

75
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,520
Kill him.

76
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,120
Yes, My lady.

77
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:47,740
(Yangque Garden)

78
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,720
This beast starved so fiercely.

79
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,200
It ruined pristine items

80
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,000
into this wretched state.

81
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,360
You dare hunger strike against me?

82
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Tell me.

83
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,880
If treated likewise,

84
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,640
would humans react worse?

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,360
Beasts calm with food,

86
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,520
forgetting the past.

87
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,040
But humans deeply wronged

88
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,160
demand blood payment.

89
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,840
True.

90
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,400
People

91
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,400
outpace beasts in stubbornness.

92
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,720
Only death

93
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,160
brings peace.

94
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,200
Do you know?

95
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,600
Excessive killing

96
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,840
dooms one to the abyss.

97
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,560
No amount of sutras will save you.

98
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,520
My lady.

99
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,520
You're not afraid of the underworld.

100
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,880
Instead,

101
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,000
you fear vengeful spirits haunting you,

102
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
seeking retribution.

103
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,360
Peel the skin off her bones!

104
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,600
I'm Prince Regent's noble concubine.

105
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,360
Aren't you afraid
he will come after you?

106
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,000
Noble concubine?

107
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,880
Just a concubine who doesn't even dare
use her real name.

108
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,920
First, you substituted
in the bridal chamber.

109
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,440
Then, you hid your true identity.

110
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,000
You played with his feelings
again and again.

111
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,080
If he were here today,

112
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,040
you'd die even faster.

113
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,520
Your Highness.

114
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,440
The Duchess is determined
to kill Lady Xiyan.

115
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,744
I grew up in the Duke's Mansion,

116
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,600
where people devour others
without mercy.

117
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,560
Your Highness,

118
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,080
please save Lady Xiyan.

119
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,200
She foresaw this outcome.

120
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,720
Before leaving,

121
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,680
she asked me to deliver this letter

122
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,120
to you.

123
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,681
(Confession Edict)

124
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,000
What?

125
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,360
Not pleading for your mistress anymore?

126
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,880
Lady Xiyan had no one to rely on,

127
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,840
yet saved the life

128
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,360
of a stranger like me.

129
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,080
I'll go to the Duke's Mansion

130
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,040
to await her corpse.

131
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,400
After burying her properly,

132
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,960
I'll follow her in death.

133
00:09:28,032 --> 00:09:29,728
(Confession Edict)

134
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:35,616
(Confession Edict)

135
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:41,152
(Your Highness.)

136
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,440
(I have drifted through half a life.)

137
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,600
(Only during my time at the mansion)

138
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,120
(did I find contentment.)

139
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,120
(Yet sadly,)

140
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,800
(the flower yearns for love,)

141
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,560
(but the stream remains cold.)

142
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,800
(I could never win your heart.)

143
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:11,100
(I still remember
our first meeting in Hexi.)

144
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,880
(A young general wore the black armor.)

145
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,880
Our first meeting in Hexi?

146
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,112
(His glance over shoulder)

147
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,960
(etched itself forever in my memory.)

148
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,960
(In my heart,)

149
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,560
(you will always be)

150
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,600
(that cold-faced general
in splendid armor.)

151
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,840
My lady.

152
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll serve her thoroughly.

153
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,920
End her breath

154
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
until you pull out her hair.

155
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,480
Yuqing.

156
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,440
Both your intelligence

157
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,280
and beauty

158
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,280
surpass Jin's.

159
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,920
What a pity.

160
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,400
You were born to the wrong womb.

161
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,000
Had you come from my belly,

162
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,720
you'd have achieved

163
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,680
more than Jin.

164
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,040
If you must hate,

165
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,760
hate your mother.

166
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,480
After all, she is just
a lowly country medic.

167
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,000
(Pei Ji,)

168
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,720
(do you truly want me dead here?)

169
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:46,960
(No.)

170
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,160
(I haven't avenged my mother fully.)

171
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,400
(I can't die before seeing Zhao.)

172
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,680
Your noble concubine Ye Xiyan
doesn't exist here.

173
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,880
There's only Shen Yuqing,
the concubine-born daughter of the Duke.

174
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,440
Who is she?

175
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,200
I'll interrogate her myself.

176
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,120
Ji,

177
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,120
women can be replaced.

178
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,680
But ties with the Duke's Mansion
and the Empress Dowager

179
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,360
would be irreversible.

180
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,160
The Prince Regent's household affairs

181
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,800
don't require your meddling.

182
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,560
Open it!

183
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,640
My cold-faced general,

184
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,120
you've come to save me at last.

185
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,000
I want the truth.

186
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,760
Ten years ago,

187
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,440
bandits overran
multiple prefectures in Hexi.

188
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,080
The imperial army crumbled.

189
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,400
The Ye family was slaughtered.

190
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,080
My mother hid me in a water vat,

191
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,560
yet rebel soldiers still found me.

192
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,240
As they pressed a blade to my throat,

193
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,840
flaming arrows

194
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,480
rained from the sky.

195
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,320
Appoint Prince Pei Ji
as fifth-rank Guerrilla General.

196
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,920
He shall lead thirty thousand troops

197
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,400
and quell the bandits in Hexi.

198
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,480
In this famine year,
the Ministry of Revenue lacks supplies.

199
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,840
The needed provisions

200
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
shall be procured locally

201
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,680
by the Prince.

202
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,120
Your Majesty.

203
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,920
The Hexi bandits now number a million.

204
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,760
Six prefectures have been ravaged,

205
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,800
farmlands destroyed.

206
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,240
The Minister of War led
300,000 elites to resist,

207
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,280
yet got defeated.

208
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,056
I won't cage myself

209
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:38,258
or fight a battle I can't win.

210
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,280
(Su Yinghua, The Empress Dowager)
These unruly rebels claim a million men.

211
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,920
But they're just a disorganized mob.

212
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,440
The Minister of War fell
due to underestimation.

213
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,000
I see you've made thorough preparations.

214
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,400
You will surely rid the court

215
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,480
of this menace.

216
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,040
Your Majesty, please...

217
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,480
The King of Wujiang
is willing to lend troops

218
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,640
but with one condition.

219
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,240
Your mother

220
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,920
must serve him.

221
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,800
Since you refuse to serve the nation,

222
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,600
then I have no choice...

223
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,840
I'll do it as your command.

224
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,800
You saved the people in Hexi

225
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,200
and me.

226
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,080
The Hexi folk call you

227
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,960
the cold-faced general.

228
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,880
Later at the orphanage,

229
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,840
I suffered constant humiliation.

230
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,360
Your wartime tales kept me going.

231
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,320
They said

232
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,600
before battle,

233
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,120
your armor shone silver.

234
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,680
But through bloodshed upon bloodshed,

235
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,720
it turned black.

236
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,000
Why it was three years ago exactly

237
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,880
when Shen Yuqing vanished

238
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,760
and you joined Meixiang House?

239
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,000
Later still,

240
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,760
the admired cold-faced general

241
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,080
became the feared Prince Regent,

242
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,360
a ruthless killer.

243
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,280
But I didn't believe it.

244
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,480
I came alone to the capital

245
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,360
just to see you.

246
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,880
Never expecting

247
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,080
to nearly lose my life.

248
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,640
Thankfully, Lady Qingmei saved me.

249
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,760
But then I grew greedy.

250
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,880
I thought

251
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,800
if I could be like Lady Qingmei,

252
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,240
maybe you'd notice me

253
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,800
and I'd become someone useful to you.

254
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,000
Your Highness,

255
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,200
have you ever

256
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,560
