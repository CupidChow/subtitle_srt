=The Maid=

00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,381
=Episode 12=

3
00:01:34,496 --> 00:01:35,560
(Dali Court)

4
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,440
I want to

5
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,520
appeal for justice
for my sworn sister Lin Jifu.

6
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,480
In the Prince Regent's Mansion,

7
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,080
there are those
with the nature of wolves

8
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,640
and the hearts of vipers,

9
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,680
plotting against lives.

10
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,840
I beg Your Honor to uncover the truth

11
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,280
to console the departed

12
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,360
and ease their spirits.

13
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,240
I beg Your Honor

14
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,440
to investigate the death of Lin Jifu

15
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,760
from the Duke's Mansion.

16
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,160
What's going on?

17
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,280
Prince Regent's concubine

18
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,160
came to us instead
of seeking the Prince Regent.

19
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,360
She must be accusing someone
the Prince Regent protects.

20
00:02:05,984 --> 00:02:06,824
The Princess Consort?

21
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,640
My lord, how should we handle this?

22
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,640
We can't afford to offend either party.

23
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,560
A life hangs in balance.

24
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,720
If you refuse this case,

25
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,240
I won't leave.

26
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,440
Let the people see

27
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,960
how the Dali Court

28
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,560
abandons justice.

29
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,520
I

30
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,160
will accompany you to the mansion.

31
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,920
Thank you, My lord.

32
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,072
(Hold on, Xiyu.)

33
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,120
(I'll rescue you
from this den of demons.)

34
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,352
(Testimony)

35
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,160
Stop!

36
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,920
You dare show your face?

37
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,240
Xiyu.

38
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,600
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,680
I came too late.

40
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,200
I didn't sign.

41
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,160
I didn't sign it.

42
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,920
(Testimony)

43
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,680
I know.

44
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,120
I know.

45
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,960
(Shen Yuqing.)

46
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,800
(Let's see you keep pretending.)

47
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,680
Greetings, Your Highness.

48
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,680
Greetings, My lady.

49
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,712
You'd better not meddle

50
00:03:35,712 --> 00:03:36,720
in the Prince Regent's

51
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,240
inner household matters.

52
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,200
My lord,

53
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,200
the Princess Consort murdered Lin Jifu

54
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,400
and tortured maid Xiyu

55
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,040
to silence witnesses.

56
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,600
More nonsense,

57
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,360
and I'll tear up your mouth!

58
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,040
Who's stirring up

59
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,160
this settled case?

60
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,520
Greetings, Your Highness.

61
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,800
Now,

62
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
go to the suburban camp

63
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,360
and inform the Prince Regent.

64
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,080
Urge him to intervene.

65
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,920
Yes, My lord.

66
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,760
(Pei Ji, since you won't act,)

67
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,480
(I'll have to make this effort)

68
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,000
(to have your subordinates summon you.)

69
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,280
Your Highness,

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,360
why have you returned?

71
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
Your mother claims

72
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,120
the Lin Jifu matter

73
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,040
is already resolved.

74
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,200
With Fu's sudden passing,

75
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,080
the maid who once cared for her

76
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,920
cannot escape blame.

77
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,560
I will investigate thoroughly.

78
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,040
The Duchess

79
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,480
is feigning one aim
while plotting another.

80
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,000
My humble self

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,160
matters not,

82
00:04:56,358 --> 00:04:57,960
but your duplicity
toward His Highness...

83
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,560
When I speak to His Highness,

84
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,720
a concubine like you
shouldn't interrupt.

85
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,240
If you wish to investigate,

86
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
let it be done.

87
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,680
I remember

88
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,720
the last to see Lin Jifu

89
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,160
was the Princess Consort, right?

90
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,760
What do you imply?

91
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,320
Whoever persists

92
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,320
in this matter

93
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,840
or stirs discord

94
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,560
will face severe punishment.

95
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,440
Take her away.

96
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,240
Go.

97
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,760
Xiyu, let's go.

98
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,179
(Testimony)

99
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,040
That cunning maid

100
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,520
should not be underestimated.

101
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,680
Shen Yuqing.

102
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,520
Daughter of the Duke's concubine.

103
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,880
Three years ago,

104
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,600
disappeared with Qin Xiaoniang.

105
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,440
Coincidentally that same year,

106
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,080
Meixiang House gained a courtesan
named Xiyan.

107
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,000
Ye Xiyan,

108
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,000
you are Shen Yuqing.

109
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,040
Yes.

110
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,240
You admit it.

111
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,280
Even with a hundred reasons to refuse,

112
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,520
as long as it pleases you,

113
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,440
I would willingly serve
as Shen Yuqing's substitute.

114
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,600
If you're not Shen Yuqing,

115
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,240
why would Xiyu betray her mistress?

116
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,760
And why go through such lengths
to save a maid?

117
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,400
Xiyu suffered Lin Jifu's oppression
for years,

118
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,200
living in constant peril.

119
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,120
Death will come either way.

120
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,880
Why not risk everything?

121
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,080
You hold such a high position.

122
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,280
How could you understand us,

123
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,240
mere mortals as small as ants?

124
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,080
If we want to survive,

125
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,600
we have to rise from the ashes
of our demise.

126
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,760
You're not me.

127
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,200
How can you presume I don't understand?

128
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,160
If you understand,

129
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,400
why abandon me to my fate?

130
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,520
They tortured Xiyu, forcing her

131
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,760
to testify I'm the daughter
of the Duke's concubine.

132
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:56,960
Then,

133
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,240
they'd drag me back
to the Duke's Mansion,

134
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,520
leaving me with no escape but death.

135
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,000
By this logic,

136
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,240
the fault lies with me?

137
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,440
What fault could you have?

138
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,840
All faults belong to me.

139
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,160
I erred

140
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,680
by knowing I'm merely your blade,

141
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,080
yet failing to remain

142
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,600
an emotionless weapon.

143
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,360
Why have Xiyu

144
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,360
taken away?

145
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,120
Sell her off

146
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,840
as far from the capital as possible.

147
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,080
I believe

148
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,440
you should keep her instead.

149
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,160
Xiyu knows Lin Jifu's secrets.

150
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,000
She could testify when needed.

151
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,640
Such

152
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
leverage against the Duke's Mansion

153
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,800
shouldn't be discarded.

154
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,800
I

155
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,320
need no mere maid's confinement

156
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,400
to confront the Duke's Mansion.

157
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,240
You hold a high position,

158
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,760
and steeped in state affairs.

159
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,080
You're too occupied for such trifles.

160
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,120
Let me handle them instead.

161
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,120
Since Madam Su and the Princess Consort

162
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,040
already see me as their thorn,

163
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,600
I'll gladly

164
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,680
shoulder more burdens for you.

165
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
In your hands,

166
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,960
you'd make me worry more.

167
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,840
In my hands

168
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,040
means being in yours, doesn't it?

169
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,120
You share the same purpose?

170
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,000
The Princess Consort has her father,

171
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,440
mother,

172
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,160
and aunt.

173
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,320
But I

174
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,880
stand utterly alone,

175
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,720
you are my only one.

176
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,800
Your Highness.

177
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,600
One day,

178
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,840
I'll make your heart yearn for me.

179
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,800
My lady.

180
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,960
Come in.

181
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,040
My lady,

182
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,400
all preparations are complete.

183
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,440
Good.

184
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,760
She's crafted clever schemes,

185
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,080
and I've built countermeasures.

186
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,160
Since I failed to condemn her with Xiyu,

187
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,560
I'll take the drastic measure

188
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,880
and lure her into our trap.

189
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,120
I failed you.

190
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,680
You arranged

191
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,960
everything for me,

192
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,560
yet I proved useless,

193
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,480
nearly dragging you down.

194
00:12:24,736 --> 00:12:26,560
(To Ye Xiyan)

195
00:12:48,896 --> 00:12:50,528
(Tomorrow at one quarter
past Shen hour,)

196
00:12:50,528 --> 00:12:51,440
(if you don't come,)

197
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,640
(every corpse in the mass graves
outside the capital will be desecrated!)

198
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,800
Madam Su is threatening me
with my mother's remains

199
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,160
hostage?

200
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,480
If you go tomorrow,

201
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,600
you admit being Shen Yuqing.

202
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,760
My lady,

203
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,120
I've notified the Capital Prefect

204
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,240
that tomorrow we catch bandits
in west suburbs.

205
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,280
We'll claim

206
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,040
Shen Yuqing encountered our operation

207
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,320
and got killed

208
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,480
by the bandits out of vengeance.

209
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,040
After being the Chief Constable
of Capital Prefecture,

210
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,840
your planning has become
much more thorough.

211
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,120
With this arrangement,

212
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,320
if Pei Ji truly inquires about her fate,

213
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,280
you can capture a few petty thieves
as scapegoats.

214
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,920
The Duke's Mansion
will remain blameless.

215
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,760
My lady, you flatter me.

216
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,760
Here's your payment.

217
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,440
Thank you, My lady.

218
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,840
You think it is insufficient?

219
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,440
I wouldn't dare.

220
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,800
Wouldn't dare?

221
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,120
Then you must have such thoughts.

222
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,280
I deserve to die.

223
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,280
Three years ago,

224
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,400
it was because of you

225
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,080
that this catastrophe occurred today.

226
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,160
I deserve to die.

227
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,880
I deserve to die.

228
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
I deserve to die.

229
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,200
I deserve to die.

230
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,760
I deserve to die.

231
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,200
I deserve to die.

232
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,040
I deserve to die.

233
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,320
I deserve to die.

234
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,320
Enough.

235
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,440
Thank you, My lady.

236
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,880
Were it not for me,

237
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,040
a mere thief like you

238
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,760
could never become a Chief Constable.

239
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,760
A bird with hardened wings

240
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,240
may possess great skills,

241
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,520
but its desires grow larger too.

242
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,920
Boss.

243
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,680
Why would there be a wedding sedan here?

244
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,200
It can't be ghosts, right?

245
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,480
Ghosts don't exist in this world.

246
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,120
Even if they do,

247
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,160
it's humans playing tricks.

248
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,280
Follow me.

249
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
As expected.

250
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,560
How should I address you?

251
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,720
Should I call you

252
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,320
Lady Ye,

253
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,360
or Shen Yuqing?

254
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,640
