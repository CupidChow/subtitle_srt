1
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,989
=The Maid=

2
00:01:31,521 --> 00:01:34,477
=Episode 11=

3
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,440
I'm here to deliver Empress Dowager's
decree and rewards.

4
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,000
Where are the Princess Consort
and Lady Jifu?

5
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,840
Lady Jifu isn't feeling well.

6
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,840
The Princess Consort
is attending to her.

7
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,760
You'd better

8
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,320
not to enter.

9
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,720
The Empress Dowager designated

10
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,400
Lady Jifu as the capital's noblest lady.

11
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,320
Lead the way.

12
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,840
Escort me to proclaim the decree.

13
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,680
Nobility comes from within.

14
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,520
Why should others judge us?

15
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,880
Please inform Her Highness
at the palace.

16
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,800
At today's ladies' banquet,

17
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,480
there is no single noblest lady.

18
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,280
All ladies present

19
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
are equally noble.

20
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,640
How dare you!

21
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,560
A mere concubine

22
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,320
dares disrespect the Empress Dowager!

23
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,560
The ladies' banquet

24
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,200
was entrusted to me
by the Prince Regent.

25
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,720
Are you

26
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,960
defying his orders?

27
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,000
Do you truly not fear death?

28
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,160
I merely want a grand farewell

29
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,360
to be remembered by you.

30
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,240
Look.

31
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,920
Fireworks.

32
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,600
So beautiful.

33
00:04:07,168 --> 00:04:08,128
Indeed.

34
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,320
Magnificent.

35
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,840
Look.

36
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,640
Over there.

37
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,040
So beautiful.

38
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,160
The title of the noblest lady

39
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,640
means nothing to you.

40
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,440
What about being my noble concubine?

41
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,160
Thank you for sparing me

42
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,760
and even promoting my status.

43
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,280
This is my final tolerance toward you.

44
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,760
Cause more trouble,

45
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,040
and there will be no mercy.

46
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,480
Truly magnificent.

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,080
Look over there!

48
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,520
(The grander and more brilliant it is,)

49
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,200
(the more people will witness it.)

50
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,440
(Only then can I show the oppressed)

51
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,000
(that the things they fear)

52
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,560
(aren't invincible.)

53
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,600
By making her a noble concubine now,

54
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,960
Pei Ji clearly intends to protect her.

55
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,440
He won't let us use her as a scapegoat.

56
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,280
She's under house arrest

57
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,760
and couldn't have acted alone.

58
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,960
What about Xiyu?

59
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,120
Capture and interrogate her.

60
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,760
Li Si has already gone to apprehend her.

61
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,600
I'll meet with the Empress Dowager

62
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,800
to suppress this matter.

63
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,000
Your Highness,

64
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,600
Xiyu has been captured.

65
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,360
As per the Duchess's instructions,

66
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,440
she's now imprisoned.

67
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,880
Hurry!

68
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,720
Fetch some water!

69
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,320
Understood.

70
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,720
You brought this upon yourself.

71
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000
What do you think you are?

72
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,880
Daring to threaten me?

73
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
You're just
a shameful illegitimate daughter.

74
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,920
As lowly as your painter father!

75
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,760
What's your wretched life worth?

76
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,720
I'm the Duke's legitimate daughter,

77
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,880
and the Princess Consort.

78
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,680
Darn you!

79
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,200
Darn you!

80
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,760
Blind fool!

81
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,040
Can't even serve properly!

82
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,760
Get out!

83
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,800
Isn't it the concubine-favoring
Prince Regent?

84
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,680
You promoted a courtesan

85
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,000
to noble concubine in public,

86
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,720
making it known to all.

87
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,320
Have you no shame, Your Highness?

88
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,960
Aren't you

89
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,040
the shameless one?

90
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,760
Even with my faults,

91
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,160
I am the Duke's legitimate daughter
and the Princess Consort.

92
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,440
That bed-hopping wretch

93
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,480
isn't fit to host my banquet!

94
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:13,234
The Empress Dowager heeded
your mother's words.

95
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,320
I covered for you too.

96
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Lin Jifu was secretly...

97
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,320
I don't want to hear this!

98
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,480
It's over.

99
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,400
Be content as Princess Consort.

100
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,920
No more schemes.

101
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,440
Pei Ji!

102
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,760
I did all these things

103
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,040
for you.

104
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,320
I am your lawfully wedded
Princess Consort.

105
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,520
Even if you despise me and punish me

106
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,480
for sending another to your bed,

107
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,200
it's been three years.

108
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,440
Isn't that enough?

109
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,280
Didn't we agree

110
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,840
that once boarding,

111
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,600
she'd have someone
send a message of safety?

112
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,400
Why hasn't it arrived?

113
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,840
This belongs to Xiyu.

114
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,400
She's still in the mansion?

115
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,560
Pei Ji has gone to the suburban camp.

116
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,160
Ye Xiyan can't save you.

117
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,720
Speak.

118
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,400
Is she Shen Yuqing?

119
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,360
You're scared.

120
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,520
All of you are scared.

121
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,520
I hate Lin Jifu.

122
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,200
But I hate you even more.

123
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,880
Though Lin Jifu has a temper,

124
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
she lacks cunning

125
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,040
and is easily persuaded.

126
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,600
Her wickedness

127
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,400
was all instigated by you!

128
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,560
Shen Yuanjin,

129
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,680
you'll die horribly!

130
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,560
This is sheer insolence!

131
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,880
A mere household slave

132
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,920
dares speak to me this way?

133
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,040
I'll see if the iron whip is harder,

134
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,840
or your stubborn mouth.

135
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,720
Beat her.

136
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,160
Understood!

137
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,360
Enough.

138
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,320
She's determined to die.

139
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,800
Can't you see that?

140
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,360
Use your knowledge.

141
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,680
She seeks quick release.

142
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,760
Then let her linger
between life and death.

143
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,520
If she denies Ye Xiyan is Shen Yuqing,

144
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,600
tear out all her fingernails.

145
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,840
Understood.

146
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,800
Mother.

147
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
(Young Shen Yuqing, Young Shen Yuanjin)
Mother.

148
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,160
Don't hit her.

149
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,520
Mother.

150
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,480
Qing.

151
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,560
Madam Su.

152
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,200
Now that I've returned as Ye Xiyan,

153
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,960
I won't let you repeat your old tricks.

154
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,800
The submissive Shen Yuqing
from the past is dead.

155
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,840
The one who now returns

156
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,600
is Ye Xiyan,

157
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,760
here to demand justice from you all.
