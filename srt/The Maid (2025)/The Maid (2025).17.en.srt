=The Maid=

2
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:34,144
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,200
Not every man

4
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,720
deserves fatherhood.

5
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,760
His Highness

6
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,440
doesn't want to confront the Duke.

7
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,880
My lady,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,560
it'll be even more perilous this time.

9
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,920
He has those he must protect.

10
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,880
And I have vengeance to pursue.

11
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,960
We're not on the same path.

12
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,040
Concubine Ye,

13
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,600
I bring word from His Highness.

14
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,200
Congratulations on becoming
a secondary consort.

15
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,000
He requests

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,480
that you put on ornaments

17
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,520
and go to the main hall

18
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,760
to receive formal congratulations.

19
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,880
Why would you

20
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,960
elevate her status now

21
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,200
and make it know to all?

22
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,640
Do you also believe

23
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:35,968
I'm bewitched by the demoness

24
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,960
and lost my mind?

25
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,840
The Duke plays both sides,

26
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,120
profiting from both you
and the Empress Dowager

27
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,240
to expand the Western Army.

28
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
Your actions

29
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,920
amount to challenging the Duke directly,

30
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,710
forcing him to ally
with the Empress Dowager.

31
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,440
Whether I promote Consort Ye or not,

32
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,520
I can't stop his scheme

33
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,920
with the Empress Dowager.

34
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,200
I'm not so base

35
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,720
as to use a woman

36
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,560
as a shield.

37
00:03:08,384 --> 00:03:10,200
You've developed feelings
for Consort Ye.

38
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,280
You want to protect her.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,360
You may deceive others,

40
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,080
but not yourself.

41
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,120
But Your Highness,

42
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,880
how much sincerity
does she hold for you?

43
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,720
You could have ascended the throne,

44
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,560
but you chose

45
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,560
to maintain peace

46
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,722
through restrained diplomacy.

47
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,920
But now, this move of yours

48
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,560
will destroy everything

49
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,920
you've painstakingly built.

50
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,200
Nanxing, my beauty.

51
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:04,832
(Lady Zheng,
Female Official of Imperial Observatory)

52
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,640
These past few days,

53
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,280
my darling Nanxing,

54
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,000
I was going stir-crazy...

55
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,440
Lady Zheng?

56
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,688
You...

57
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,560
Why are you here?

58
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,520
Why do you meet me at Meixiang House?

59
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,160
My lord,

60
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,360
the demoness scheme I devised for you

61
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,120
has only just begun.

62
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,840
Would you abandon me now?

63
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,600
I must consider the broader situation.

64
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,560
You sent me
into the Imperial Observatory.

65
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,040
I tread on thin ice
by the Empress Dowager's side,

66
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
scheming for you and the Western Army.

67
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,240
Have you forgotten?

68
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,240
My darling.

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,672
Don't cry.

70
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,080
Wait a bit longer.

71
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,720
Jin's position in the mansion
is unstable.

72
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,200
We must curb Pei Ji's arrogance

73
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,480
and establish authority.

74
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,720
When Pei Ji eventually falls...

75
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,800
But Pei Ji doesn't believe
in spirits or demons.

76
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,168
He even promotes Ye Xiyan
to secondary consort

77
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,480
and publicly vows to protect her.

78
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,480
Do you think

79
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,800
a mere prophecy

80
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,800
could hurt them?

81
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,512
What clever plan
do you propose, my dear?

82
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
Do you know

83
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,920
what's most precious in this world?

84
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,320
Beautiful women, of course!

85
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,120
In this world,

86
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,960
only lost things become truly precious.

87
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,720
The Western Army enjoys ample funds

88
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,320
with minimal campaigns.

89
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,960
If suddenly deprived,

90
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,960
what do you think will happen?

91
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,280
And if they lose it
because of that demoness?

92
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,000
Mutiny.

93
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,000
Now, all four Western Army commanders

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,400
came to mourn.

95
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
All our troops

96
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,240
are camped outside the city.

97
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,160
How to ensure complete success?

98
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,320
My lord,

99
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,560
the only thing needed

100
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,960
is your death.

101
00:07:03,904 --> 00:07:04,840
Explain yourself.

102
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,960
I observed the heavens.

103
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,040
Something will happen tonight.

104
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,720
I won't disturb your enjoyment.

105
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,960
My lady, don't go.

106
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,520
My lady, please don't leave.

107
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:35,520
My darling Nanxing,

108
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,320
you've finally come.

109
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,520
Let's go.

110
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,160
My dear,

111
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,160
I'm here.

112
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,040
Capture the assassin!

113
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,560
Over there!

114
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,520
Catch him!

115
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,120
Is there anything inappropriate

116
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,960
about my makeup today?

117
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,560
You've always been too coquettish.

118
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,920
It always feels artificial to me.

119
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,840
Today,

120
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,520
you seem more like your true self.

121
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,880
The Astronomer of Imperial Observatory
has arrived.

122
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

123
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,720
Your Highness,

124
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,560
after repeated calculations,

125
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,920
we found Ye Xiyan's birth chart

126
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,160
aligns with prophecies of chaos.

127
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,020
Not suitable to be a secondary consort.

128
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,040
You also analyzed my own fate,

129
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,880
calling me an ominous person.

130
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,560
Perfectly matched then.

131
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,920
The Princess Consort has arrived.

132
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,280
Your Highness, will you

133
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
prioritize a woman
over the nation's safety?

134
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,640
What virtue do I possess

135
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,560
to influence state affairs?

136
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,600
Assassinating the Duke,

137
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,080
and plunging the nation into chaos.

138
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,760
Ye Xiyan.

139
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,360
Kneel!

140
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,000
Do you recognize this man?

141
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,480
I've never seen him.

142
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,640
What about this?

143
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,920
That's something I lost.

144
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,800
How strange that your lost item

145
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,800
ended up with Nanxing
from Meixiang House?

146
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,600
Witnesses reported

147
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,640
you met her yesterday.

148
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,160
Nanxing and I are friends
from Meixiang House.

149
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,280
Private gatherings are common for us.

150
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,200
After my sister-in-law's death,

151
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,240
my brother deliberately
kept his movements secret.

152
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,760
He rarely went out.

153
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,560
The assassin has confessed

154
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,960
that you colluded with Nanxing

155
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,400
to lure the Duke to Meixiang House

156
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,680
for an ambush.

157
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,280
That shameless Nanxing

158
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,000
had already packed her valuables

159
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,400
for escaping

160
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,520
during the chaos.

161
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,200
With strict security in the capital,

162
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,880
how could she vanish

163
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,600
without your coordination?

164
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,600
If I wanted to assassinate the Duke,

165
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,440
would I be foolish enough

166
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,360
to leave so many clues?

167
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,360
Today is my secondary consort's
investiture banquet.

168
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,520
Must you all act this way?

169
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,000
Your Highness,

170
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,440
Ye Xiyan caused my mother's death.

171
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,040
Now she tries to kill my father.

172
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,320
Will you still protect her,

173
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,720
showing no regard for our marital bonds

174
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,440
and favoring a concubine
over your lawful wife?

175
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,640
Your Highness.

176
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,312
King You deceived nobles with beacon

177
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,120
to amuse Baosi.

178
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,680
King Zhou

179
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,440
heeded Daji's words

180
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,600
to slaughter loyal officials.

181
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,760
Emperor Xuanzong's

182
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,880
exclusive favor for Consort Yang

183
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,920
sparked mutiny.

184
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,360
Now,

185
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,400
for this woman's sake,

186
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,960
you would abandon the Duke's Mansion

187
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,800
and the Western Army.

188
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,880
Isn't that prove she's a demon?

189
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,640
By the Empress Dowager's decree,

190
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,280
Ye Xiyan's birth chart is inauspicious.

191
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,480
She implores you
to prioritize the realm.

192
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,080
Don't endanger the court

193
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,520
for a demoness.

194
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,840
King You was tyrannical.

195
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,680
King Zhou was virtueless.

196
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,400
Emperor Xuanzong was excessive.

197
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,880
And you

198
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,960
are incompetent.

199
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,040
What did you say?

200
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,240
How dare you overstep your station?

201
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,360
If you want to impose a crime,

202
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,920
there's no lack of pretext.

203
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,480
This country is governed by men.

204
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,200
Its ruin also comes from men.

205
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,440
But the blame and disgrace

206
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,640
are all shouldered by women.

207
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,240
How absurd!

208
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,800
Your Highness,

209
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,560
we can't delay.

210
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,720
The optimal time

211
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,680
is at midnight tonight.

212
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,864
Burn the demoness.

213
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:41,760
Reduce her to ashes.

214
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,720
Otherwise,

215
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,240
the realm will descend into chaos.

216
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:44,992
Exactly.

217
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,800
Your Highness.

218
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,800
The Western Army is about to rebel.

219
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,320
Your Highness.

220
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,320
Your Highness,

221
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,240
the Western Army remains
armed and vigilant,

222
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,448
showing intent to attack.

223
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:25,160
Your Highness.

224
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,080
Commoners demand you

225
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,840
kill the demoness.

226
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,448
End the mutiny.

227
00:14:28,448 --> 00:14:29,008
Your Highness.

228
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,040
Empress Dowager is furious.

229
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,256
She's summoned officials.

230
00:14:38,624 --> 00:14:40,026
Send Consort Ye out of the capital.

231
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,200
I can't leave.

232
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,320
Ye Xiyan,

233
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,560
if you wish to stay with me,

234
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,160
once this is resolved,

235
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,520
I'll bring you back.

236
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,360
Now,

237
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,560
I represent you.

238
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,120
If I retreat,

239
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,200
you will lose ground in this war

240
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,480
against the Empress Dowager

241
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,520
and the Duke.

242
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,760
Your political authority

243
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,800
and power

244
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,520
will be utterly destroyed.

245
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,000
You underestimate me greatly.

246
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,160
I was never meant to be

247
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,640
among those you must protect.

248
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,400
As a courtesan,

249
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,120
becoming your consort
was fortune enough.

250
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,240
I won't burden you further.

251
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,160
Your Highness.

252
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,920
Step aside.

253
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:07,424
We'll follow you through life and death.

254
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,080
If you insist on this course,

255
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,160
you must trample our corpses first.

256
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,680
- Please trample our corpses first.
- Please trample our corpses first.
