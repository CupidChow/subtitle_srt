00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:31,232
=The Maid=

2
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:35,008
=Episode 20=

3
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,240
Let go of me!

4
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,680
He will stay with you from now on.

5
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,120
His clothes look expensive.

6
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,688
Could sell for a good price.

7
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,160
My father is the Prince Regent.

8
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,840
My dad is the Emperor!

9
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,040
My dad's the Prime Minister.

10
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,800
No. He's the Retired Emperor.

11
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,136
Give it here.

12
00:02:04,352 --> 00:02:05,360
Give it to me.

13
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,680
Hand it over.

14
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,880
Is this how you care for Zhao?

15
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,480
Father, save me!

16
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,560
Can you protect him for his whole life?

17
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,560
He's my son.

18
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,440
I will protect him all his life.

19
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
Then what kind of life

20
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,920
do you want for him?

21
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,280
To be a wastrel?

22
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,720
Or follow your path

23
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,520
of regency over the realm?

24
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,720
You must worry about him too.

25
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,680
Or you wouldn't have sent him
to train in the mountains,

26
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,120
restraining his temper.

27
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,320
Why do you care

28
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,840
so deeply for him?

29
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,480
Your child

30
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,600
is my child.

31
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,240
Whatever punishment he receives,

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,120
I shall share the same.

33
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,680
Master Zhao,

34
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,520
without your father,

35
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,640
this is your fate.

36
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,320
You rely on my father's favor

37
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,080
to hurt my mother

38
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,920
and humiliate me!

39
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,880
Even without your father,

40
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,680
I can still thrive.

41
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,200
(Her care for Zhao seems genuine.)

42
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:34,690
Go investigate

43
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,720
why Shen Yuqing was kept

44
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,080
in Yangque Garden years ago,

45
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,280
and how she escaped.

46
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:39,840
Understood.

47
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,800
His Highness dislikes
your coddling of Zhao.

48
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,744
Perhaps,

49
00:04:59,744 --> 00:05:01,480
he wants Zhao to learn hardship.

50
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,160
She manipulates
both the father and the son well.

51
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,920
All these years,

52
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,960
I've indulged

53
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,720
and spoiled him,

54
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,400
yet never earned Pei Ji's approval.

55
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,320
Fine.

56
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,360
The real show

57
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,800
is yet to come.

58
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,320
Why don't you run?

59
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,120
I'll teach you to survive

60
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,880
without your father.

61
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,480
(Back against the wall.)

62
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,080
(They'll have to attack one by one.)

63
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,056
(Defense and evasion)

64
00:06:53,056 --> 00:06:54,640
(are more vital than brute strength.)

65
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,040
(Target the weakest.)

66
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,520
(Neutralize in one move.)

67
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,480
(Capture the leader.)

68
00:07:07,648 --> 00:07:08,640
(Don't rush to attack.)

69
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,320
(Read the situation.)

70
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,440
You dare hit my buddies?

71
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,320
Take this.

72
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,240
Can I join you?

73
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,520
Eat.

74
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,080
Could work.

75
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,120
You seem smarter than them.

76
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,256
Here.

77
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,640
We're buddies now.

78
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
Well then. Take this.

79
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,160
I, Gou, will look out for you.

80
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,640
Mother Consort Ye.

81
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,840
Mother Consort Ye.

82
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,200
Father,

83
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,960
can I bring Gou

84
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,240
to the mansion?

85
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,040
We're sworn brothers.

86
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,800
I hate seeing them suffer.

87
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,960
But in this world,

88
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,520
many suffer like them.

89
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,000
Are you going to shelter them all?

90
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,680
Father,

91
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,480
I'll grow stronger

92
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,840
than you.

93
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,800
Then Gou and others

94
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,920
will have enough food and their homes.

95
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,120
Well said!

96
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,680
You are better than I.

97
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,800
Without rising to the heights,

98
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,480
how would you know
the torment of falling,

99
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,880
bones shattered

100
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,360
and heart pierced?

101
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,712
My lady,

102
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,840
I came to change
Master Zhao's nightclothes.

103
00:11:02,592 --> 00:11:03,712
I'll take care of it.

104
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,176
What if you, His Highness

105
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:11,120
and Master Zhao

106
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,680
could remain like this forever.

107
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,160
His Highness

108
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,360
harbors affection for you.

109
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,880
Why haven't you

110
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,160
told him the truth?

111
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,280
The Emperor is soon to govern in person.

112
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,600
The mansion

113
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,080
appears prosperous,

114
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,040
but is perched on the edge of danger.

115
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,440
I only wish my Zhao

116
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
to live peacefully.

117
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,640
I don't want him

118
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,360
involved in these political struggles.

119
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,420
The Princess Consort humbled herself

120
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,840
and even urged Master Zhao

121
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,120
to bond with you.

122
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,440
I feel a bit uneasy.

123
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,200
I wonder what she's scheming.

124
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,960
Whatever she intends,

125
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,160
I will take Zhao away.

126
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
How could it be?

127
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,320
There's nothing here?

128
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,064
What's wrong?

129
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,200
I remember Zhao had a half-inch

130
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,480
crescent birthmark
on his right shoulder.

131
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,600
How could it be gone?

132
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,560
Could I have misremembered?

133
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,760
I-I fear...

134
00:12:25,024 --> 00:12:25,960
Could it be...

135
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,960
Could it be that

136
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,960
Master Zhao isn't your child?

137
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,304
My lady.

138
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,960
What a touching scene of maternal love.

139
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,840
Too bad.

140
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,600
I'll never see it again.

141
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,920
Whose child is Zhao?

142
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,160
His origin matters not.

143
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,000
What matters

144
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,080
is that he's not yours.

145
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,160
Where is my child then?

146
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,920
Shen Yuqing,

147
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,600
you've finally dropped the act.

148
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,400
That child you bore

149
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,760
was fated like you and your mother

150
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,000
to suffer short lives.

151
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,160
Died just days

152
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,560
after being brought back.

153
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,960
That's impossible.

154
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,416
That's impossible.

155
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,944
That's impossible.

156
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,040
He must still be alive!

157
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
Fearing you might bear a daughter,

158
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,680
I preselected several children
from outside.

159
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Revenge...

160
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,560
Child theft...

161
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,800
All for nothing!

162
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,080
Do you know how your child died?

163
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,080
He caught constant high fever,

164
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,480
cried endlessly,

165
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,000
and then soiled its bedding,

166
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,200
filthy and stinking.

167
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,120
I had it tossed into the woods

168
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,640
for wild dogs and rats to devour.

169
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,320
Had you not fled,

170
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,200
your mother and child

171
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,160
would still live.

172
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,376
Shut up!

173
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,200
Mother!

174
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,736
Master Zhao!

175
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,880
