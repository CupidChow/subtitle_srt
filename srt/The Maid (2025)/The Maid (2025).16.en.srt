=Episode 16=

3
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,120
(Shen Xiao, The Duke)
My lord, have a drink.

4
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,360
Father,

5
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,440
how can you have the leisure to drink?

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,720
What else can I do?

7
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,040
It has come to this.

8
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,160
I can only drown my sorrows in wine.

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,280
Through my mother's family connections,

10
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,400
you rose
from a destitute scion of nobility

11
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,520
to a military-backed Duke.

12
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,160
Now that she has lost power,

13
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,320
you want to abandon her?

14
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,040
I'll beg Pei Ji

15
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,000
and the Empress Dowager.

16
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,280
Foolish.

17
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,360
You've been married to Pei Ji for years.

18
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,800
Can't you see

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,240
his intentions?

20
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,800
He wants to sever our ties

21
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,040
with the Empress Dowager.

22
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,112
It's all your mother's fault.

23
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,120
She was careless in her schemes

24
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
and left evidence behind.

25
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
None of us can save her now.

26
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,080
Everything she did

27
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,040
was for you and the Empress Dowager.

28
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,872
And for me.

29
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,280
As her daughter,

30
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,480
I can't watch her die.

31
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,360
All her actions were for our sake.

32
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,960
I believe she'll understand.

33
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,360
Father.

34
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,800
You...

35
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,560
What do you mean?

36
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,680
This is the only way left.

37
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,880
Mother!

38
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,080
How did you become like this?

39
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,520
What happened?

40
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,440
It seems

41
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,600
the Empress Dowager's people
have been here.

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,880
You cannot speak now.

43
00:04:28,032 --> 00:04:29,920
Are they shifting all blame

44
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,192
onto us?

45
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,480
Father,

46
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,560
let's bribe the jailers

47
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,520
and find a dead prisoner
to replace my mother.

48
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,840
Are you out of your mind?

49
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,560
Only her death will satisfy

50
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,160
the Empress Dowager and Pei Ji.

51
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,568
Only then can we escape.

52
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,520
Darling.

53
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,360
Darling.

54
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,120
Darling.

55
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,360
How you've suffered.

56
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,320
Over the years,

57
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,560
you've killed so many people.

58
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,880
Whether I cared for them

59
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,040
or not,

60
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,560
you let nobody escape.

61
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,600
Call it karma cashing in what you owe.

62
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,120
What are you gaping at?

63
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,320
Lend a hand!

64
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,080
Come on!

65
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,160
Bad news!

66
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,560
The Duchess has hanged herself.

67
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,320
Lady Yuqing,

68
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,320
Shen Yuanjin's greatest support,

69
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,040
Madam Su, has fallen.

70
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,080
Empress Dowager won't protect her.

71
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,560
But why don't you

72
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,680

we will flee the capital.

Your Highness, what do you want?

100
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,040
Yesterday, why did you

101
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,680
save the Duke's household?

102
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,960
You know

103
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,160
those concubines and their daughters?

104
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,352
I am but of lowly birth.

105
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,120
Seeing those restless souls,

106
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,360
I couldn't help recalling the past.

107
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,920
I feel their sorrow as my own.

108
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,280
Return these evidences

109
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,080
on my behalf.

110
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,400
(Mother's acupuncture pouch?)

111
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,000
Thank you.

112
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,840
For what?

113
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,400
For upholding justice.

114
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,960
While investigating at Dali Court,

115
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,760
I heard stories.

116
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,440
That Shen Yuqing, who resembled you,

117
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,800
and her mother

118
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
suffered extreme abuse

119
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,080
in the Duke's Mansion.

120
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
The Duchess

121
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,400
punished Qin Xiaoniang

122
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,080
with routine beatings.

123
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,040
Or worse,

124
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,400
forced naked in winter's chill.

125
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,920
As for Lin Jifu,

126
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
what she enjoyed most

127
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,480
was abusing Shen Yuqing.

128
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,360
The two of them,

129
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,880
one went mad,

130
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:47,112
and the other mute.

131
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,360
Four years ago,

132
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
they were confined in Yangque Garden.

133
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,600
Pecked by birds,

134
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,120
and their palms pierced by iron chains.

135
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,960
After that,

136
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,760
they vanished without a trace.

137
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,000
You pitied them?

138
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,120
Back then, the Empress Dowager

139
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,280
threatened my mother to coerce me

140
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,560
into quelling the Hexi rebellion.

141
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,360
It was a suicide mission.

142
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,960
But If I died,

143
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,920
no one would've protected

144
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,320
my mother in the Cold Palace.

145
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,720
Your Highness...

146
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,480
A palace eunuch

147
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,960
acted on the Empress Dowager's order.

148
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,560
He humiliated her,

149
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,600
tormented her,

150
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,440
and dislocated her limbs,

151
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,680
forcing her to crawl.

152
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,080
Every rainy night since,

153
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,720
she suffered bone-chilling cold.

154
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,600
Do you know

155
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,240
why I despise deception?

156
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,240
My mother had chronic heart disease.

157
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,160
Her most trusted nanny

158
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,520
told her

159
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,560
I'd perished in Hexi.

160
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,880
The shock triggered her condition.

161
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,800
She never saw my return

162
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,280
before passing away.

163
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,080
So,

164
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,480
you purged the harem upon returning.

165
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,440
You became known as

166
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,000
the bloodthirsty

167
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,400
and tyrannical Prince Regent.

168
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,640
It's not sympathy

169
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,000
but understanding.

170
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,320
Yet I also have people to protect.

171
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,880
So no matter who you are,

172
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,520
this ends now.

173
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,720
- What's happening?
- It's nothing.

174
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,360
The demoness has appeared.

175
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,760
Chaos descends.

176
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,400
When examined in the prison,

177
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,920
no words were found.

178
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,600
A cursed omen.

179
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,920
Disaster approaches.

180
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,680
Quick, let's go!

181
00:14:17,032 --> 00:14:17,920
My lady.

182
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,800
My lady.

183
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,320
The whole capital whispers

184
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,400
that you're the demoness.

185
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,720
The Duke schemes to destroy you.

186
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,240
Why rage?

187
00:14:28,232 --> 00:14:28,980
I don't believe

188
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,960
he hasn't heard the talk

189
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,160
that you are Shen Yuqing.

190
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,800
At least he should verify

191
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,200
if you're truly his daughter.

192
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,200
Daughter?

193
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,560
My beauty...

194
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,360
My lord,

195
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,560
we're in public.

196
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,200
Public?

197
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,840
That makes it more thrilling!

198
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,400
My lord...

199
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,280
Come on.

200
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,240
My lord,

201
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,240
someone's watching.

202
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,840
Hold this.

203
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,200
Can't even hold clothes?

204
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,400
Useless!

205
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,880
Guards!

206
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,040
Take this maid away.

207
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,600
Sell her off.

208
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,880
Father!

209
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,760
My lord,

210
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,800
she's Yuqing,

211
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,170
your own flesh and blood.

212
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,960
