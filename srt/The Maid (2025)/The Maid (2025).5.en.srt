1
00:01:27,603 --> 00:01:31,232
=The Maid=

2
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:34,496
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,000
Qingmei,

4
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,560
what is Xiyan's true background?

5
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,040
Your Highness,

6
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,840
this ungrateful woman...

7
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,920
is actually the daughter
of the Ye family from Hexi,

8
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,720
Ye Xiyan.

9
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,600
Her grandfather served as a Prefect,

10
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,480
but later faced rebel uprisings

11
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,640
and bandit massacres.

12
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,120
Her entire family were perished.

13
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,920
After being abducted,

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,520
she suffered countless defilement.

15
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,640
How could such a person

16
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,720
be the Prince Regent's concubine?

17
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,040
Qingmei,

18
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,160
if you speak one false word,

19
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,760
killing a courtesan in the mansion

20
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,800
means nothing.

21
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,920
Your Highness, didn't you promise

22
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,240
that exposing her identity

23
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,840
would eliminate her?

24
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,080
We're both women.

25
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,080
Is this bit of chastity

26
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,600
enough to tell purity from filth?

27
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,960
Had His Highness been an ordinary man,

28
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,520
would he have carried me
into his mansion

29
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,400
before everyone's eyes?

30
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,240
You fail to keep His Highness' favor

31
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,240
and resort to targeting my background.

32
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,560
How laughable!

33
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,960
Pitiable!

34
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,360
Pathetic!

35
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,080
You dare toy with me?

36
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,000
Since Your Highness breaks promises,

37
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,520
I'll settle this myself.

38
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,040
I escaped death once,

39
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,760
thinking I left a tigers' den.

40
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,360
Turns out I just enter wolves' lair.

41
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,040
For three years,

42
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,320
you claimed to train me,

43
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,960
yet you tortured me.

44
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,240
At the slightest mistake,

45
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,880
you lashed me with bamboo,

46
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,360
bound me with ropes,

47
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,760
and pierced me with thorns.

48
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,320
I've remembered

49
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,880
every detail.

50
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,240
Don't bring outside filth
into this mansion.

51
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,440
Beat this troublemaker hard!

52
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,568
Understood.

53
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,520
Thank you, Your Highness.

54
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,000
Punishing such trash

55
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,080
requires public spectacle.

56
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,160
So His Highness would see

57
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,560
you upholding justice for me.

58
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,200
Trivial matters

59
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,600
needn't trouble His Highness.

60
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,240
Expel Qingmei from the mansion!

61
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,160
Lady Qingmei,

62
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,200
your palanquin awaits.

63
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,760
Master,

64
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,920
Pei Ji rarely hosts banquets.

65
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,760
Missing this chance,

66
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,080
I may never get another.

67
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,000
To take revenge,

68
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,800
you need to make yourself

69
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,360
as venomous as Mandala.

70
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,000
No.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,880
Master, I can't!

72
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,256
I can't.

73
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,800
Without disfigurement,

74
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,600
I can't escape

75
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,120
the nobles' sordid power games.

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,440
I grow weary.

77
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,160
Xiyan,

78
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,320
I'll enable your path,

79
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,440
as you enable mine.

(My dear disciple,)

87
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,800
(this is my final act for you.)

88
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,016
(Master,)

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,120
(I can't escort you from the capital.)

90
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,400
(May your journey be safe)

91
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,640
(and life unshackled.)

92
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,120
(Shen Yuanjin,)

93
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,880
(now do you see me as a true rival?)

94
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,600
(Use your power and influence)

95
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,400
(against me.)

96
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,080
(Let me send you)

97
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,960
(to the abyss sooner.)

98
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,840
Your beauty-blade cuts deep.

99
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,080
The Princess Consort's

100
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,080
two cheap shots missed.

101
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,560
She smashed everything in sight.

102
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,480
Has the Hexi envoy returned?

103
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,120
The Ye clan perished in war.

104
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,240
No records remain.

105
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,440
No loose ends

106
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,000
is the biggest flaw.

107
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,080
Your Highness,

108
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,480
shall we still employ her?

109
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,160
A rootless orphan girl.

110
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,840
If she threatens my safety,

111
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,440
just kill her.

112
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,640
What brings you to me, Your Highness?

113
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,760
The ladies' banquet approaches.

114
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,640
My duties keep me occupied.

115
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,680
Leaving little time to attend to you.

116
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,000
You overthink.

117
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,840
As long as His Highness treats me well,

118
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,120
that's all I require.

119
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,720
It remains improper regardless.

120
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,120
My cousin will be staying
at the mansion shortly.

121
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,560
Let her

122
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,280
keep you company in my stead.

123
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:56,896
(Lin Jifu, Cousin of Shen Yuanjin)

124
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,040
How could two people
resemble each other so strikingly?

125
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,400
No.

126
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,560
Qing lacked your delicate refinement.

127
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,720
Xiyan is simply Xiyan.

128
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,480
Every last one of you

129
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,680
mistakes me for that Qing girl.

130
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,800
Your voice carries similar sweetness.

131
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,600
Yuanjin,

132
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,200
where ever did you

133
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,480
find such a charming girl?

134
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,480
What exquisite artistry.

135
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,040
(Even if you're not Shen Yuqing,)

136
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,080
(so long as you share her face,)

137
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,480
(you'll suffer her same fate.)

138
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,920
(When Lin Jifu brands you with scars)

139
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,440
(and drives you to madness,)

140
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,080
(I'll see what you've left
to challenge me.)

141
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,000
(Your terror then,)

142
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,360
(will become their weapon against you.)

143
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,840
(Be driven to madness or death by fear,)

144
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,400
(or wield fear as your blade?)

145
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,920
(The choice is yours.)

146
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,880
(Lin Jifu,)

147
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,960
(you've come at last.)

148
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,600
Jifu, why abandon your painting?

149
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,560
I burned myself.

150
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:12,608
Did the floral mark imprint?

151
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Let me see.

152
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,720
Lady Xiyan's jade-like skin

153
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,640
must make floral marks enchanting.

154
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,560
Lady Jifu, please don't.

155
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,560
Qing's scars faded

156
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,240
with time.

157
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,120
Let me see

158
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,440
how yours will turn out.

159
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,560
No more escaping.

160
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,040
