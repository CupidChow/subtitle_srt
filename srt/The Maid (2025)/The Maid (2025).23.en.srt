This was left by my mother.

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,120
If she wants to protect the child,

92
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,960
ensure Pei Ji attends

93
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,680
the morning court session
as usual today.

94
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,360
Understood.

95
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,080
Before Zhao is safely evacuated,

96
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,840
the Empress Dowager will try

97
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,280
to keep you in the palace.

98
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,720
After Zhao is safely evacuated,

99
00:09:21,216 --> 00:09:22,080
she'll eliminate...

100
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,920
Eliminate me.

101
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,320
If Zhao can't be evacuated,

102
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,560
she will risk her life

103
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,440
to clash with me at Xuanzheng Hall.

104
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,520
I control the imperial guards.

105
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,360
If anyone dies, it'll be her.

106
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,992
Therefore,

107
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,960
her schemes won't reach that far.

108
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,160

109
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,240
to this day

110
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,680
and becoming Prince Regent,

111
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,320
I understand her better than you.

112
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,880
She's just like Madam Su,

113
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,000
vicious but short-sighted.

114
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,840
Don't overthink it.

115
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,600
Just focus on saving Zhao.

116
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,320
That you care for me

117
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,840
is enough.

118
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,520
Your Highness.

119
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,200
Shen Yuanjin has left the palace

120
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,120
with Master Zhao.

121
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,360
I've got people on them.

122
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,360
We must act swiftly.

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,560
Zhao still awaits you.

124
00:10:22,944 --> 00:10:23,880
Go now.

125
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,520
If the Empress Dowager
realizes the trick,

126
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,720
it won't end well for you.

127
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,760
If I don't attend court,

128
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,960
she'll be suspicious,

129
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
and Zhao'll be in danger.
