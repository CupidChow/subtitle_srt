00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,530
Miss Shi Qi, you've finally willing to do a private painting of us.

4
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,410
That's right. We've been waiting for a long time.

5
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,090
Does this angle make me look better, Miss Shi Qi?

6
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,990
Miss Shi Qi, please highlight my waist.

7
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:59,530
Miss Shi QI, do I look good on my left or my right side?

8
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,890
Who is that?

9
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,330
- Guest. Miss Shen.
- Don't make it public or else I'll kill you.

10
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,830
Where is the painter name Shi Qi?

11
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:39,300
Shi Qi, ever since you did a private painting of me, all of a sudden you are now famous here at Liujin.

12
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,320
- Here.
- Ying Xiu.

13
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,230
I'm just an ordinary painter, not someone who specializes in private paintings.

14
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,180
I know.

15
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,720
Didn't you say that she was lost in a brothel when she was a child?

16
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,670
It's perfect. The girls at Ningxiang Pavilion and Hongxiu Pavilion will all come to you to paint them.

17
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:04,870
Take this opportunity to check if any of them have a plum blossom on their shoulders.

18
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,140
Out of all the girls here, you have the best looking shoulders.

19
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,200
Really?

20
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,380
Of course.

21
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,680
Leave. Get out. All of you.

22
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,210
Miss Shen, I've already explained it to you.

23
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,510
They are just courtesan who are afraid of getting old.

24
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,870
Having a painting is just for a memory in the future.

25
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:53,280
But you're a daughter of the Prime Minister, why do you want me to paint you?

26
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,300
Do you want to see your sister?

27
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,360
My sister? You know where she is?

28
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,870
If you want to see her, tomorrow at 11am come to the Qingying Residence .

29
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,460
If you come and paint me, I'll tell you where she is.

31
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,450
Miss Shen?

32
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,780
The wine is spilled. Let me get you a new jug.

33
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:12,910
Don't go. If you step out of this room, you'll never see your sister again.

34
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,710
Sister?

35
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,740
Where is my sister?

36
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:27,550
Draw what you see, once you're done, I'll tell you where your sister is.

37
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,380
Your recent fragrance powder smells is very special.

38
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,370
Do you like it?

39
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,990
I can't stop myself from liking it.

40
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,620
Who's there?

41
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,980
Just a stray cat.

42
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:07,850
No matter what, tomorrow I need to decline my marriage with Xiao Hansheng.

43
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,750
Decline your marriage?

44
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:15,860
Xiao Hansheng, he's the only son of the Duke of Zhen State, General Fuyuan, appointed by His Majesty.

45
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,200
Besides, your father personally asked for this marriage.

46
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,050
He's just General Fuyuan.

47
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,560
You are Prince Ning, a son of His Majesty.

48
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,710
What reason would you give to decline this marriage?

49
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:36,310
Are you going to tell His Majesty, you, the daughter of a dignified Prime Minister

50
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:42,190
and Xiao Hansheng have a marriage arrangement? And still not ashamed of having an affair with a Prince?

51
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,890
But I don't love him.

52
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:57,490
If you really love, you must marry Xiao Hansheng for our future.

53
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,330
If he can be used by me in the future,

54
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,680
I will naturally have a way to get you back.

55
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:12,580
If you can't wait for you to be come a widow one day, you can only come to my manor in name only.

56
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,720
I am pregnant.

57
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,630
It's not the first day that we've met.

58
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,610
Marry Xiao Hansheng and be a good general's wife.

59
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,710
When I get what I want...

60
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,010
Miss Shen?

61
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,100
Miss Shen.

62
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,320
Miss Shen?

63
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,260
I've completed your painting, Miss Shen.

64
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,920
Miss Shi Qi, aren't you curious

65
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,490
to why I asked you to paint this painting for me?

66
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,790
Other people's business is none of my concern. I don't have to be curious.

67
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:44,440
I've done your painting. Where is my sister?

68
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,750
Miss Shen.

69
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,440
Do you have someone you love?

70
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,480
Is there someone you dream about?

71
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,320
Have you thought about wanting to stay by his side?

72
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,090
I...

73
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:17,340
Sounds like you do. So do I.

74
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:23,990
But in order to stabilize the imperial court, he wants me to marry someone I've never met.

75
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:28,900
If it was you, would you be willing?

76
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:34,420
I... My parents passed away when I was a child.

77
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,720
My only sister and I also got separated years ago. I don't know how you feel.

78
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,220
However, Miss Shen, you can try to discuss it with the Prime Minister.

79
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,930
So naive.

80
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,260
Perhaps you don't even know my sister's whereabouts.

81
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,310
You've lied to me to get me to paint for you.

82
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,380
It's almost dawn, I'm leaving.

83
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,660
I'll put the painting here.

84
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,620
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone about today.

85
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:21,180
Miss Shen, Miss Shen?

86
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,710
Miss Shen? Miss Shen, don't take things too hard.

87
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,950
Miss Shen. Miss Shen!

88
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:16,590
The kindness you've shown to me today will be repaid.

89
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,350
Such a beautiful face, it will be mine from now on.

90
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,620
Do you have someone you love?

91
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,550
Do you have someone you dream of?

92
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:40,120
Have you thought about wanting to stay by his side?

93
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:47,880
I have a savior who I've only met once.

94
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,170
I'm fond of him but I don't know who he is.

95
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,390
Miss, are you afraid?

96
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,140
I'm not afraid.

97
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,350
Miss, you're finally wake!

98
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,950
Miss... who is...

99
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,260
I'm Xiao Qian. I'm the dowry servant from the Prime Minister Manor.

100
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,130
Prime Minister Manor? Then where is here?

101
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:28,010
The general's manor. Today is your and General Xiao's set by the matchmakers.

102
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:33,100
But you were in a coma so the Prime Minister sent you here first.

103
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,030
- Draw what you see.
- Sister.

104
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,210
Once you've completed the painting, I'll tell you where she is.

105
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,790
Miss Shen, don't take it so hard.

106
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,010
Miss.

107
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:02,240
Such a beautiful face, it'll be mine from now on.

108
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,780
What's the matter, Miss?

109
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,020
I'm not your Miss. This is not possible.

110
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,400
Are there any other mirrors?

111
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,530
Other mirrors?

112
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,820
Miss, you're veil!

113
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,200
Miss!

114
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,250
I'm not your Madam. Where's a mirror?

115
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,490
- Where are the mirrors?
- Miss. Madam!

116
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,450
Miss!

117
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,190
Madam!

118
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,070
- Miss! Madam!
- I'm not your Madam.

119
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,500
I'm not!

120
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,930
Miss! Madam!

121
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,960
- Miss! Madam! What's the matter?
- Where are the mirrors?

122
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,270
- I'm not your Madam.
- What's the matter, Miss?

123
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,120
- Miss!
- Madam!

124
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,710
- Madam!
- Madam!

125
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,330
- Madam!
- Madam!

126
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,500
Stop!

127
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,950
Madam! The General had given order!

128
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,010
No one is to go near that part of the house.

129
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,940
Xiao Hansheng, I'm from the Crown Prince Manor.

130
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,970
You're just one of the Prime Minister's people.

131
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,000
You can't detain me!

132
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,160
When the Crown Prince was in trouble, where were you?

133
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,620
Can you handle being in charge?

134
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,340
Your time is up when he's done getting changed.

135
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:42,470
- When is it your turn to speak? Let me go!
- Time's up.

136
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,100
Mirror.

137
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,040
Xiao Hansheng! Xiao Hansheng!!

(Jinliu House)

139
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,150
Is Shen Qian strange?

140
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,850
Yes. She said she's not Shen Qian.

141
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,940
This girl. She's willing to do anything to not marry Xiao Hansheng.

142
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,540
But Miss is...

143
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:50,180
There's no buts. I'm her brother and I know her personality.

144
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:00,810
And you... You should do what I've told you to do.

145
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,110
Young Master, I do not dare to do so.

146
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,350
Get up.

147
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:10,750
You better listen and go back. Otherwise, I'll kill you if you're not careful.

148
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,370
Miss.

149
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:01,580
Young Master forced me!

150
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,380
What are you doing?

151
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,250
General.

152
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,520
Madam was getting up. I was putting on her veil.

153
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,950
You're dismissed.

154
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,900
Don't move. Let me help you.

155

Are you all right?

156
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,430
Are you all right?

157
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:08,240
General. It's you.

♫  Take advantage of the disappearing rain with a trip back to the old city  ♫

159
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:27,080
♫  Can't erase the story of misty rain and stirring up chaos by the river  ♫

160
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,130
♫  In the old dreams, the lights tint the clamor of the Mortal World  ♫

161
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,760
Here.

162
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,780
♫  In the old dreams, the lights tint the clamor of the Mortal World  ♫

163
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:40,300
♫  But now, things are out of tunes, distorted or sparse  ♫

164
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,840
The wine spilled. Let me go get a new one.

♫  I heard the rumor that the wind blew and fell to the ground  ♫

166
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,820
♫  Don't dare to disturb the sound of the bells, don't dare to startle a dream  ♫

167
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:58,740
♫  I'm afraid that the story will not be able to portray the amazing beauty of that year  ♫

♫  Loving you is a love affair between the wind and moon,  ♫

The person who Shen Qian had to marry is him.

170
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,330
I have her face now and she wants me to marry him in her place.

171
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:15,280
♫  The Mortal World should have a beginning and no end  ♫

172
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,020
General. Actually, I not...

173
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,080
Let's drink the nuptial wine.

174
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:34,370
Wait... General, I'm really not...

175
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,140
Stop talking.

176
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,040
Here.

177
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,530
Do you have someone you love?

178
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,170
Have you ever thought

179
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,790
of wanting to stay by his side?

180
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,250
All right.

181
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,220
Let's call it a day.
