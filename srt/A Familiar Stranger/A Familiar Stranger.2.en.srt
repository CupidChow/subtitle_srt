credit

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,680
The informant was a failure. Prepare to launch a fierce attack.

4
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,200
Xiao Hansheng, I'm your military adviser and you're not protecting me?

5
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,430
I almost got killed just now.

6
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,090
Clean the courtyard.

7
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,170
Clean the courtyard?

8
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,230
I'm your military adviser!

9
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,190
Military adviser!

10
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,800
Are you okay? You were startled.

11
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,890
- I'm okay. 
 - It's getting late today, rest early.

12
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,200
Tomorrow we can leave first thing in the morning.

13
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,070
Leave the General Manor?

14
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,550
Yes.

15
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,160
General.

16
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,330
Don't worry. I'll explain to the prime minister.

17
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,020
You arranged someone to kill her.

18
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,150
I was thinking that if General's wife dies a violent death on the wedding night,

19
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,290
Xiao Hansheng will definitely not escape being related to it.

20
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,850
Oh, beautiful.

21
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,730
Thank you for your praise, Prince.

22
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,470
Do you know that Shen Qin is on my side?

23
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,330
I know.

24
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,320
But Prince, wasn't she allowed to marry Xiao Hansheng?

25
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,350
I'm guessing that your intention is definitely to use the opportunity to take down the Xiao family.

26
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,310
You don't dare to do it. I'll do it.

27
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:40,550
Wonderful, so wonderful.

28
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,380
Do I need you to do these things for the immediate interest?

29
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,010
I want Xiao Hansheng to be on my side. This way, do I need to be afraid of King Qu and King Lian?

30
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,870
You pig!

31
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,700
If something happens to Shen Qin tonight,

32
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,850
you as the brother prepare two coffins.

33
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,490
Two coffins? Whose?

34
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,890
You guess.

35
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,080
I guessed it. I'll go do it immediately.

36
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,750
Sister, you must not die. You must not die!

37
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,730
Madam, I'm Fu Ling. General sent me to serve you getting dressed.

38
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,320
This is the change of clothes prepared for you.

39
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,090
Madam, you were startled today. I've prepared soup that will calm your nerves. General has also ordered us not to disturb you.

40
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,030
We will be waiting outside the door. Call us if there's anything.

41
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,400
<i>I'm Shi Qi, not Shen Qin.</i>

42
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,700
If Prince really died of Croup, why did he hold this jade pendant so tightly in his hands?

43
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,420
Duke Zhen repeatedly urged you not to investigate Prince's death.

44
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,360
You're good. You came back to get married because of this.

45
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:20,950
I really don't understand why Father insisted me to come back to get married now.

46
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,250
<i>The imperial court is in turmoil after Prince's death.</i>

47
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,470
<i>With the current national affairs, how can I go back and get married?</i>

48
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,830
<i>What is national affairs? What is family affairs?</i>

49
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,940
<i>Prince's death a national affair. Getting married is a family affair.</i>

50
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,820
<i>Prince's death is a fact. Subsequently, no matter who succeeds the Prince,</i>

51
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,040
<i>it's only a battle of the imperial court. How can it be a national affair?</i>

52
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:50,050
<i>My Xiao family is a family of generations, guarding the border with the aim of guarding the territory and protect the civilians.</i>

53
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,640
<i>Family affairs are national affairs.</i>

54
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,520
<i>If the imperial court is not stable, how will the civilians have a home?</i>

55
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,730
<i>You don't need to say anymore. Anyhow, Prince's case,</i>

56
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,760
<i>you're not allowed to care.</i>

57
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,150
<i>Go back quickly to get married.</i>

58
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:12,230
<i>Come back when you understand why the generals fight so hard in the battlefield.</i>

59
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,580
When something bad happened to the Prince, over at Prime Minister's manor, they initiated a request for marriage.

60
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:21,020
If you really investigate, she'll be a clue. You're good. You want to chase out the clue that is automatically given.

61
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,720
Now I really don't understand you.

62
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,980
Firstly, I've seen the ligature marks on her hands.

63
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:32,040
She was obviously kidnapped here. Someone wants her to die in the General Manor. Secondly...

64
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,900
Secondly what?

65
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,540
My instinct is that she's not a treacherous person.

66
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,480
Instinct? You don't even know her. Why do you believe your instinct again?

67
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:49,140
My instinct saved my life and also your life.

68
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,680
If this matter has nothing to do with her, I cannot harm an innocent person.

69
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,950
Let's see if she leaves tomorrow, then we'll talk. If she really leaves, then it's an arranged marriage by the emperor.

70
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,200
Can you bear the responsibility of the General's wife going missing for no reason?

71
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,520
If she does not leave, maybe all of this is a trick.

72
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,300
She is accompanying you to act.

73
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:29,310
<i>Thanks General for taking care of me. I temporarily borrow a piece of clothing.</i>

74
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,180
She really meant it when she said she will leave.

75
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,140
It's good that she left.

76
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,160
General, someone is here at the palace.

77
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,370
What's the matter?

78
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,680
He said to ask General and his wife to receive the imperial decree.

79
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,740
Your trouble is here.

80
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,400
Miss Shen.

81
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,250
Miss Shen, come out!

82
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,650
I know you are here. Come out!

83
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,380
You came earlier than I expected.

84
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,880
It turns out that my face is so pretty.

85
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:46,670
This tear mole is so pitiful and makes people have an affection.

86
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,070
Why did I forget about it?

87
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,050
Give me back my face!

88
00:08:54,050 --> 00:09:00,600
I put in so much effort to change my face to yours. Do you think I will give it back to you so easily?

89
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,820
I say again. Give me back my face!

90
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,740
Come. You kill me.

91
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,590
Kill me and I can't give you back your face anymore.

92
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,460
You want to see your sister?

93
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,380
She's in front.

94
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,970
Eunuch Hai brought the decree of the lady with an honorary title conferred by imperial mandate. He already waited for very long.

95
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,280
I've long told you that this is an arranged marriage by the emperor. You can't let her go.

96
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,460
If there's still nobody going out to receive the imperial decree, that'll be defying the decree.

97
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,480
Sister.

98
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,850
If you want to save her, use my face to do something for me.

99
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,740
Eunuch Hai.

100
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,910
- Military Adviser. 
 - Please.

101
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,380
I've already drank the fifth cup of tea. Where is the General's wife?

102
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,810
General and his wife got married yesterday. They are newly wedded.

103
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,370
Today naturally they got up late.

104
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:45,380
Military Adviser, you see the sky is almost dark. They are still not up?

105
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,540
Eunuch Hai, don't be impatient. It'll be soon.

106
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,420
Your sister got poisoned. I'm helping her counteract the poison with poison.

107
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,680
If you go over there now, you'll lose your life.

108
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,150
If she leaves this bathtub, she'll also lose her life.

109
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:06,010
If you want to save her, use my face to do something for me.

110
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:10,780
Based on just that plum blossom on her back, how can you prove that she's my sister?

111
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,670
You gave this to your sister when you were young.

112
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,940
Nobody else will know best what this is.

113
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:37,260
I want you to use my face to marry Xiao Hansheng. When I give birth a child, naturally I'll return your face to you.

114
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,960
During this period, you must not let Xiao Hansheng know your identity.

115
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,050
Your sister's life is in your hands now.

116
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,200
You choose what you should do.

117
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,320
General, Military Adviser said he cannot hold on any longer.

118
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,940
<i>I have to face it.</i>

You're back, Madam.

00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,520
Why are you looking at me like that, General?

154
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,420
Nothing.

155
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,600
Just a bit, reminding me someone.

156
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,350
We're so close.

157
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,490
I don't know how to come close to you.

158
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,510
Didn't I tell you to leave? Why did you return?

159
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:26,330
I know, but His Majesty bestowed this marriage.

160
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,640
General saved me.

161
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,590
I cannot be ungrateful and abandon you.

162
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,850
<i>Did I tell you to leave?</i>

163
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,050
<i>You saved me.</i>

164
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,400
<i>I cannot be ungrateful and abandon you.</i>

165
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,030
This tear mole...

166
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,980
General. Madam.

167
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,430
Madam, we've already tidied up the side annex.

168
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,340
You want to sleep in the side annex?

169
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,950
Yes.

170
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,920
Fine.

171
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,570
Send whatever madam asks for.

172
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,160
Yes.

173
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,410
I heard Fuling mention that the Madam wants to move to the side annex.

174
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,340
You guys are sleeping separately?

175
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,510
- Stop being so nosy. 
- I...

176
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,700
Madam, the General, he...

177
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,350
Fuling.

178
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,190
Do as the Madam says. Go on.

179
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,530
- Military Advisor.
- Madam.

180
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,550
Wow, the fireflies are gorgeous.

Madam, breakfast is ready.

222
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,430
I just ate.

223
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,980
Fuling, can I head out for a bit later?

224
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,440
Of course,  General already said madam can come and go freely.

225
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,640
I am going to prepare the carriage.

226
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,830
No need.

227
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,720
I can walk around.

228
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,290
Understood.

229
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:32,580
Fuline, if General asks about me, just say I am out for shopping, can you?

230
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,460
Fuline understands.

231
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,060
You are here.

232
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,010
What you call me for?

233
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,110
Did you find out what's the crown prince's heirloom that Xiao Hansheng has?

234
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,320
I promised to remain in the General's Manor in your behalf.

235
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,230
But I didn't agree to do thing requested by you.

236
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,170
But I did thing for you.

237
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,920
Xiaoqian.

238
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,320
She's a close acquaintance of the Grand Chancellor.

239
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,570
She'll be a threat if she remains by your side.

240
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,590
You're insane.

241
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,070
I'm insane?

242
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,060
On the night of your marriage with Xiao Hansheng,

243
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,270
she helped my foolish elder brother plot your demise.

244
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,400
Indeed I help you.

245
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,310
I can't let such a traitorous servant live.

246
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,500
I will not do anything for you again.

247
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,520
What's going to your pitiful elder sister?

248
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,290
If she hasn't my medicine.

249
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:59,080
she won't even survive tonight.

250
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:05,730
My marriage is a simple affair. Your Highness doesn't need to offer such lavish gifts.

251
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,650
General Xiao, you're a Fuyuan General personally appointed by His Majesty.

252
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:13,090
The Xiao family has contributed greatly to defending the country and are people I respect deeply.

253
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:17,380
You are of a similar age as I am. We should get along like brothers.

254
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:22,470
However, I never had the chance to speak with you.

255
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:27,710
I'm just a military general. I dare not see myself as equals with the imperial family.

256
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:31,920
I can't accept such lavish gifts.

257
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,040
General, you're being too severe.

258
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,180
I should be the one looking up to you.

259
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,900
If General, does not mind.

260
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,460
Treat these as resources for the soldiers at the borders.

261
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,370
What do you think?

262
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,930
I thank you on behalf of the soldiers at the borders.

263
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,010
Xiao Hansheng.

264
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:04,900
One day, I'll make you serve me.

265
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,220
I am sorry.

266
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,140
Your Highness.

267
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,170
Both of you, stand on guard.
