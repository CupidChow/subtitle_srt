00:01:43,152 --> 00:01:44,592
(Is this a date?)

26
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:48,087
I also rented an apartment with Juemei.

27
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:49,608
I live there on weekends.

28
00:01:50,248 --> 00:01:52,128
This community is where my parents live.

29
00:01:52,408 --> 00:01:53,727
As it's close to the exhibition hall,

30
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:54,688
parking is convenient.

31
00:01:57,487 --> 00:02:02,048
- You've lived here since childhood?
- Yes.

32
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:05,248
It's very quiet.

33
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:07,808
Do you want to note down my number?

34
00:02:08,287 --> 00:02:09,767
In case it's crowded
and we are scattered.

35
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:11,088
It will be easier to find you.

36
00:02:13,727 --> 00:02:15,167
- Okay.
- Give me your phone.

37
00:02:27,287 --> 00:02:27,727
It rings.

38
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,522
(New contact: Mo Qingcheng)

39
00:02:35,024 --> 00:02:37,200
(New contact: Sheng)

40
00:02:37,607 --> 00:02:40,368
- Okay.
- Let's go.

41
00:03:01,327 --> 00:03:02,648
Happy Valentine's Day to you two.

42
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:04,887
Thank you.

43
00:03:06,528 --> 00:03:08,887
There are quite a lot of people today.

44
00:03:18,488 --> 00:03:20,808
Over there are a pair of
cosers in couple skins.

45
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:22,928
You play it too?

46
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,767
Well, not actually,
but I've written fan songs for them.

47
00:03:27,528 --> 00:03:28,488
What a coincidence.

48
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:30,847
Coincidence?

49
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:34,447
- Let's check over there.
- Okay.

50
00:03:41,447 --> 00:03:42,727
Qiang Qingci?

51
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:49,447
How come you have
free time to visit today?

52
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:52,167
I happened to have time today,
so I came to look around.

53
00:03:53,088 --> 00:03:54,368
I am sorry.

54
00:03:54,928 --> 00:03:55,808
It's fine.

55
00:03:58,408 --> 00:03:58,928
Are you okay?

56
00:04:05,968 --> 00:04:06,567
This is...

57
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:07,688
Shengshengman.

58
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:09,007
I know.

59
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:10,528
You've been low-key for years.

60
00:04:10,648 --> 00:04:12,648
But this time, it's all over the world.

61
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:15,248
This is Mo Bai.

62
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:16,808
- Hello.
- Hello.

63
00:04:16,808 --> 00:04:19,767
Have you listened to the fan song sung
by Qiang Qingci for Honor Of Kings?

64
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:21,887
Yes. I even set it as my ringtone.

65
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:22,567
Send it to me.

66
00:04:22,608 --> 00:04:23,288
I haven't yet.

67
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:24,647
(No wonder he said it's a coincidence.)

68
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:29,928
You have to be careful of
being surrounded by his fans.

69
00:04:30,288 --> 00:04:31,207
Shengshengman.

70
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:36,808
Mr. Mo Bai, it's time to go on stage.

71
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:37,608
Mu is waiting for you.

72
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:39,928
Okay. I'm going to the stage. See you.

73
00:04:40,087 --> 00:04:41,007
- Okay. Go ahead.
- Bye.

74
00:04:41,128 --> 00:04:41,808
- Bye.
- Bye.

75
00:04:45,048 --> 00:04:46,368
He has a partner named Mu.

76
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:49,327
They will be performing soon.

77
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:04,168
That white-haired one is Mu.

78
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:10,647
One is Zhuge Liang.
The other is Zhao Yun.

79
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:23,767
Do you want to buy souvenirs?

80
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:25,808
- Alright.
- Let's go.

81
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:29,248
The flowers you bought are pretty.

82
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:31,128
- Do you like them?
- I do.

83
00:05:31,608 --> 00:05:32,407
Thank you, my dear.

84
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:33,928
- I love you so much.
- Me too.

85
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,048
What are we going to eat?

86
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,128
- Let's go for hotpot.
- Sounds good.

87
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,288
Happy holiday, darling.

88
00:05:39,087 --> 00:05:39,767
Is this for me?

89
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:40,647
Are your hands cold?

90
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:42,447
- Kind of.
- Let me warm them for you.

91
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:44,407
Do you like it? I picked it specially.

92
00:05:44,407 --> 00:05:45,407
Happy Valentine's Day.

93
00:05:45,407 --> 00:05:46,327
I like it. Thanks.

94
00:05:46,327 --> 00:05:47,488
(Point)
Not cold now. Thank you.

95
00:05:47,887 --> 00:05:50,887
(Today is really
an auspicious even-numbered day).

96
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:52,928
(Hold your hand, and grow old with you)

97
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:53,447
Thank you.

98
00:06:00,128 --> 00:06:00,447
Yummy?

99
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:19,688
Juemei.

100
00:06:24,407 --> 00:06:25,248
Hello.

101
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:27,887
- You are...?
- Yes.

102
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:30,007
I'm Juemei.

103
00:06:32,248 --> 00:06:34,248
You came here for a date, right?

104
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:35,168
No.

105
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:37,967
I didn't know it was Valentine's Day.

106
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:41,248
Don't worry. I will definitely not
leak anything online.

107
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:42,007
Absolutely not.

108
00:06:42,608 --> 00:06:44,848
I've been listening to your audio drama
for ten years already.

109
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:45,967
Sign, please.

110
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:53,488
You're not Geng...?

111
00:06:53,488 --> 00:06:54,608
Sign and I'll leave.

112
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,288
Before your girlfriend arrives.
In case of any misunderstandings.

113
00:07:08,848 --> 00:07:09,368
Take a photo.

114
00:07:12,327 --> 00:07:12,887
The V sign.

115
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:15,128
Three, two, one, yeah.

116
00:07:19,527 --> 00:07:21,207
May your dubbing team
get better and better.

117
00:07:21,248 --> 00:07:21,928
Thank you.

118
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:40,688
(I'm here.)

119
00:07:47,608 --> 00:07:48,248
Here, here, here.

120
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:55,608
Geng Xiaoxing.

121
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,087
Hello, I'm Juemei.

122
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:03,168
You're welcome.

123
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:08,327
So cute.

124
00:08:10,527 --> 00:08:11,288
Which one do you like?

125
00:08:12,128 --> 00:08:13,688
No, thanks. I'll pay myself.

126
00:08:14,647 --> 00:08:16,928
Really. I can do it myself.

127
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:19,887
Hello, do you have a complete set?

128
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,887
Do you mean a couple set?

129
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:24,087
No need for that.

130
00:08:24,168 --> 00:08:25,848
Which character does
your girlfriend like?

131
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:27,368
I can find a couple set for you.

132
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:31,407
Which character?

133
00:08:33,407 --> 00:08:35,088
Or, you want them all.

134
00:08:36,687 --> 00:08:39,527
No need. This one and this one.

135
00:08:40,007 --> 00:08:41,848
These two are popular among girls.

136
00:08:41,848 --> 00:08:43,047
Then I'll wrap them up for you.

137
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:46,407
- You want Mu and Mo Bai's autographs?
- Okay.

138
00:08:46,728 --> 00:08:48,088
Hello, don't wrap them up yet.

139
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,088
We'll go for the signs.

140
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,448
All right. Here you are.

141
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:52,208
I've paid.

142
00:08:53,248 --> 00:08:54,527
Are you two cosers?

143
00:08:55,608 --> 00:08:56,128
No.

144
00:08:56,248 --> 00:08:58,007
I just saw you talking to Mo Bai.

145
00:08:58,047 --> 00:08:59,807
I thought you were from the same circle,

146
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:01,167
just without coser make-ups.

147
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:02,687
But you two are really good-looking.

148
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:04,647
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

149
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,687
Then let's go line up.

150
00:09:08,687 --> 00:09:10,968
Mu and Mo Bai, can you
sign autographs for me?

151
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:15,448
Thank you.

152
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,368
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

153
00:09:17,568 --> 00:09:18,488
Am I seeing things?

154
00:09:18,608 --> 00:09:19,328
No, you're not.

155
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:21,007
This is the famous Shengshengman.

156
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:24,927
Hello, may I take a photo with you?

157
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,927
- No problem at all.
- Come on.

158
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:28,568
Thank you.

159
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:36,608
One, two, three, and done.

160
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:37,887
Thank you.

161
00:09:38,488 --> 00:09:40,728
Can you sign an autograph for me?

162
00:09:40,887 --> 00:09:43,728
- Sure. Come on.
- Here.

163
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:46,192
(Mo Bai)

164
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,128
This is a special heart for my brother.

165
00:09:51,927 --> 00:09:53,047
What would you like me to sign?

166
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:54,248
Best wishes for happiness?

167
00:09:54,368 --> 00:09:57,167
No. It should be "May you hear
the patter of tiny feet soon."

168
00:09:57,328 --> 00:09:59,527
Alright. Joking should have a limit.

169
00:10:00,448 --> 00:10:02,728
You brought her over
and won't let us joke?

170
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:03,328
Exactly.

171
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:04,287
Alright, alright.

172
00:10:06,763 --> 00:10:08,560
(Mu)

173
00:10:10,407 --> 00:10:12,088
Nice to meet you.

174
00:10:12,687 --> 00:10:13,728
Thank you. Nice to meet you.

175
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:16,728
You go on with your business.
We won't disturb you.

176
00:10:17,128 --> 00:10:18,128
Let's eat together later.

177
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,287
No, thanks. We're leaving.

178
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:20,448
Fine.

179
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:21,368
- Bye.
- Bye.

180
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:22,007
Goodbye.

181
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:26,047
So it's the two of us to eat again.

182
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:27,608
I don't have time for you.

183
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,712
When this ends,
I need to pick up my sister for my mom.

184
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:31,289
Isn't it Sunday today?

185
00:10:32,368 --> 00:10:33,687
She is going to the amusement park.

186
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:38,128
Oh my. It's so boring eating alone.

187
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:41,007
You have to butt in
when I'm dining with my sister?

188
00:10:41,448 --> 00:10:43,488
Sounds good. Can you take me? Please.

189
00:10:44,248 --> 00:10:45,088
All right.

190
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:46,608
Anyway, my sister likes you.

191
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:48,088
If we go together, she will be happy.

192
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:49,208
Exactly.

193
00:10:49,807 --> 00:10:50,807
- Hello.
- Can we take a photo?

194
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:51,488
Sure, sure.

195
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:52,368
I'll help you take it.

196
00:10:52,368 --> 00:10:53,208
Stand in the middle.

197
00:11:02,887 --> 00:11:06,128
(How should I explain
I didn't know today is Valentine's Day?)

198
00:11:06,368 --> 00:11:08,488
(Is it too much
to take out the contract now?)

199
00:11:09,328 --> 00:11:11,208
(Forget it. I'll pretend I don't know.)

200
00:11:12,128 --> 00:11:13,248
(Forget it. Maybe later.)

201
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:16,608
Hello, would you like to order
a Valentine's Day set meal?

202
00:11:16,728 --> 00:11:18,248
(Love at first sight)
It is popular today.

203
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:24,208
(Love at first sight)
Then we'll have this one. Thanks.

204
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:25,527
Okay. Wait a moment.

205
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:34,167
The reason for meeting you today
is to sign this contract.

206
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:35,287
(Cooperation Agreement)
Look.

207
00:11:35,647 --> 00:11:36,287
Okay.

208
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:39,968
This is just a part of the procedure.

209
00:11:40,088 --> 00:11:42,488
It will facilitate our administration
to do the follow-up work.

210
00:11:42,608 --> 00:11:44,968
But rest assured.
This contract does not involve money.

211
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:56,128
Since you've said that,
let me be honest.

212
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,887
I didn't know today is Valentine's Day.

213
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:03,968
Don't overthink it.

214
00:12:05,248 --> 00:12:06,328
I didn't overthink.

215
00:12:07,088 --> 00:12:09,007
I didn't know today
is Valentine's Day either.

216
00:12:11,088 --> 00:12:11,767
I see.

217
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:30,527
(Is this a date?)

218
00:12:43,807 --> 00:12:44,527
Hold on for a moment.

219
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:50,208
Hello, Director Liu.

220
00:12:52,807 --> 00:12:53,968
Okay. I got it.

221
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:56,368
I'll be back right away. Okay.

222
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,248
I'm sorry. I might have to leave
as something happened at the hospital.

223
00:13:06,128 --> 00:13:08,368
No worries. We've pretty much
finished our tour here.

224
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,807
- You better take off now.
- I'm sorry.

225
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:13,328
No need to apologize. I understand.

226
00:13:13,728 --> 00:13:16,088
I told you we have
several doctors in my family.

227
00:13:16,728 --> 00:13:17,287
Better leave.

228
00:13:24,647 --> 00:13:26,968
(Should I say
I need to go back to school first?)

229
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,807
(So as not to delay his work.)

230
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:32,208
Cheng.

231
00:13:33,927 --> 00:13:34,488
Uncle.

232
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:38,248
Haven't seen you for a while,
you naughty boy.

233
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:39,248
You look more handsome.

234
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:42,088
She is...?

235
00:13:43,007 --> 00:13:43,568
Gu Sheng.

236
00:13:44,287 --> 00:13:45,128
This is my uncle.

237
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:47,407
Uncle, nice to meet you.

238
00:13:48,368 --> 00:13:49,208
Gu Sheng.

239
00:13:49,608 --> 00:13:50,568
This is your girlfriend?

240
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:52,568
You know what?

241
00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:55,167
Our Mo family's daughters-in-laws
are all exceptional.

242
00:13:57,328 --> 00:13:58,167
Your parents.

243
00:13:58,328 --> 00:14:00,047
I haven't seen them
for more than a week.

244
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,128
Go back and tell them

245
00:14:01,328 --> 00:14:02,968
we must get together over the weekend.

246
00:14:03,527 --> 00:14:05,007
They went out for a seminar.

247
00:14:05,248 --> 00:14:06,328
I'll do it when they get back.

248
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:09,047
It's harder to schedule with family
than it is with outsiders.

249
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:09,848
Well then.

250
00:14:09,968 --> 00:14:10,647
Later,

251
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,167
let Cheng take you to my house.

252
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:14,728
Your aunt cooks really well.

253
00:14:14,848 --> 00:14:16,368
We'll prepare a big meal for you then.

254
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:17,767
Understood, Uncle.

255
00:14:18,088 --> 00:14:19,167
That's settled then.

256
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:20,608
I have to go.

257
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:21,728
Take care, Uncle.

258
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:22,927
- Bye.
- Bye, Uncle.

259
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,288
I'll return to the hospital.

260
00:14:34,728 --> 00:14:36,208
I'll drop you off at the supermarket.

261
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:39,728
Alright.

262
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,167
Let's go. I'm a bit in a hurry.

263
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:46,568
Okay, then let's go.

264
00:14:51,488 --> 00:14:53,128
Give me your bag.

265
00:14:57,348 --> 00:14:57,948
Thank you.

266
00:14:59,248 --> 00:14:59,848
Is it hot?

267
00:14:59,968 --> 00:15:03,047
- Want to take off the down jacket?
- Alright.

268
00:15:16,968 --> 00:15:17,607
Let's go.

269
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,167
We're here.

270
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,687
I'll be going then.

271
00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:58,328
I'll try to finish my work quickly.
Let's have dinner together.

272
00:15:59,568 --> 00:16:00,128
No need.

273
00:16:04,807 --> 00:16:08,488
I have to go home
for dinner tonight. Rain check.

274
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,047
Wait a second.

275
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:16,328
Put on your down jacket and backpack
before getting out of the car.

276
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:42,728
Alright, I'll call you tonight.

277
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:05,128
- Bye.
- Bye.

278
00:17:10,128 --> 00:17:11,368
Did you celebrate Valentine's Day?

279
00:17:11,608 --> 00:17:13,768
You said you wouldn't be coming home.
Why you're back?

280
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:16,848
Okay, help me watch for a while.

281
00:17:18,048 --> 00:17:18,568
I have to go.

282
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:20,247
There's an event in the evening.

283
00:17:23,368 --> 00:17:23,927
Yiru.

284
00:17:53,048 --> 00:17:55,088
Do you all meet there?

285
00:17:56,048 --> 00:17:56,848
It's just me and you.

286
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:03,568
Do you want to note down my number?

287
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:05,768
In case it gets crowded
and we get separated.

288
00:18:06,088 --> 00:18:07,048
It'll be easier to find you.

289
00:18:08,247 --> 00:18:09,647
Happy Valentine's Day to both of you.

290
00:18:10,407 --> 00:18:11,128
Thank you.

291
00:18:15,008 --> 00:18:16,288
I'm sorry.

292
00:18:16,288 --> 00:18:16,967
It's okay.

293
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:17,687
Are you okay?

294
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:21,647
Which character does
your girlfriend like?

295
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,447
I can find a couple set for you.

296
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:25,368
Gu Sheng.

297
00:18:25,487 --> 00:18:26,328
This is your girlfriend?

298
00:18:27,088 --> 00:18:28,008
You know what?

299
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,487
Our Mo family's daughters-in-laws
are all exceptional.

300
00:18:36,008 --> 00:18:37,048
(What would you like me to sign?)

301
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:38,247
(Best wishes for happiness?)

302
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:39,207
(No.)

303
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,447
(It should be "May you hear
the patter of tiny feet soon.")

304
00:18:57,088 --> 00:18:58,447
(What on earth are his thoughts?)

305
00:18:59,487 --> 00:19:01,207
(Be calm, Shengshengman.)

306
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:03,288
(Calm down.)

307
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:05,368
Shengshengman?

308
00:19:07,368 --> 00:19:08,887
Shengshengman!

309
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:12,128
Oh, my. It's really you.

310
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:12,848
Oh, my.

311
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:14,808
How did I not realize it was you?

312
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:16,768
Ever since I found out
you are my idol's girlfriend,

313
00:19:16,848 --> 00:19:18,727
I seriously listened to
all your recordings

314
00:19:18,768 --> 00:19:20,487
from your birthday parties and concerts.

315
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:22,288
How did I not realize it was you?

316
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,048
So amazing! Oh, my!

317
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:26,368
I-I am not.

318
00:19:26,487 --> 00:19:27,647
Impossible. You certainly are.

319
00:19:28,328 --> 00:19:30,328
I r-really am not.

320
00:19:30,328 --> 00:19:32,008
Stop pretending. I won't believe it.

321
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:33,568
You certainly are.

322
00:19:35,088 --> 00:19:36,407
Well, don't worry.

323
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:37,687
I'm the only one who knows this.

324
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:38,967
I won't tell anyone.

325
00:19:39,088 --> 00:19:40,848
I will carry the secret to the grave.

326
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:41,487
Don't worry.

327
00:19:44,247 --> 00:19:46,008
How did you know I...?

328
00:19:46,088 --> 00:19:48,088
In fact, it was Mo Bai
who just made a Weibo post.

329
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:49,768
I'll show you. Check it out.

330
00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:51,608
This is the Weibo post he made.

331
00:19:51,747 --> 00:19:53,668
(Coser Mo Bai: My bad. I deleted it.)
It has been widely reposted.

332
00:19:53,687 --> 00:19:56,687
Then Mo Bai deleted it right away.

333
00:19:56,768 --> 00:19:58,808
Can you believe I even caught it?

334
00:19:58,808 --> 00:20:00,927
Oh, my. I am so lucky, right?

335
00:20:01,288 --> 00:20:02,167
Oh, my.

336
00:20:04,528 --> 00:20:06,887
Sheng, don't worry.

337
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:09,528
I promise I won't tell anyone.

338
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:11,447
But you have no idea

339
00:20:11,528 --> 00:20:13,608
how thrilled I was
when I recognized you.

340
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:15,048
There's a "Sheng" in your name.

341
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,407
But why didn't I think of it?

342
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:19,608
W-What did he post?

343
00:20:20,447 --> 00:20:22,727
He just posted
a silhouette photo of you two.

344
00:20:23,647 --> 00:20:26,247
I mainly noticed the bag and sack
you just brought back.

345
00:20:26,407 --> 00:20:28,088
And your outfit and hairstyle.

346
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:29,967
I knew right away that it must be you.

347
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:32,487
At first, Mo Bai
didn't say anything about the photo.

348
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:35,207
But once Mu reposted it,
everyone understood it.

349
00:20:36,008 --> 00:20:37,808
Let me show you. Look.

350
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:40,128
Look at what he said
when he reposted it.

351
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:42,167
(Coser Mu)
Aren't they Qiang Qingci and his wife?

352
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:43,447
Do you know?

353
00:20:43,768 --> 00:20:46,727
Mu is my favorite coser.

354
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:48,808
If I hadn't been keeping
an eye on him at all times,

355
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:50,647
I would have missed this.

356
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:51,808
But don't worry.

357
00:20:51,808 --> 00:20:52,768
He deleted it in a second.

358
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:53,927
Right away.

359
00:20:54,048 --> 00:20:55,927
I guess many people
didn't have time to capture it.

360
00:20:56,128 --> 00:20:57,848
Just me. I...

361
00:20:58,487 --> 00:20:59,407
Oh, my.

362
00:20:59,447 --> 00:21:00,368
Stay calm.

363
00:21:00,368 --> 00:21:01,447
Sheng,

364
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:04,128
you have no idea how many years
I've been a fan of Qiang Qingci.

365
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:08,487
Do you know how I've been coping with it
over the years?

366
00:21:08,687 --> 00:21:10,167
Excuse me, do you have basins?

367
00:21:11,608 --> 00:21:12,608
Welcome.

368
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:27,128
Sheng!

369
00:21:27,447 --> 00:21:29,407
Hold on. Wait a minute.

370
00:21:29,528 --> 00:21:30,647
I have one last question.

371
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:33,727
The doctor who came to
our store the other day.

372
00:21:36,887 --> 00:21:38,768
He wants to pursue you?
He is trying to steal you away?

373
00:21:38,848 --> 00:21:40,128
Even away from my idol?

374
00:21:41,487 --> 00:21:42,608
I get it right, don't I?

375
00:21:42,727 --> 00:21:43,967
No.

376
00:21:45,528 --> 00:21:50,167
He is just my senior
from next-door college.

377
00:21:50,808 --> 00:21:53,887
He's quite nice. Just a bit quiet.

378
00:21:54,808 --> 00:21:56,687
Okay, then. I can rest assured.

379
00:21:57,528 --> 00:21:58,288
I'll be leaving.

380
00:21:58,528 --> 00:21:59,647
Alright. Bye. Oh!

381
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:01,687
Could you say hello to my idol for me?

382
00:22:02,528 --> 00:22:03,647
Alright. Bye.

383
00:22:09,207 --> 00:22:11,207
The senior from next-door college.

384
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:12,568
What is that?

385
00:22:42,288 --> 00:22:42,727
Arrived.

386
00:22:46,008 --> 00:22:47,008
Thank you.

387
00:22:47,447 --> 00:22:49,247
Sorry to interrupt your Valentine's Day.

388
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:51,487
No problem. I'm free today anyway.

389
00:22:58,727 --> 00:22:59,368
Bye.

390
00:23:01,368 --> 00:23:02,008
Bye.

391
00:23:32,848 --> 00:23:33,848
Mom, I'm back.

392
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:37,407
Why didn't you tell me
in advance when you headed back?

393
00:23:37,487 --> 00:23:38,887
I didn't leave any food for you.

394
00:23:39,048 --> 00:23:42,207
No. I was at a friend's house nearby,
so I came back.

395
00:23:44,247 --> 00:23:45,608
Mom, why are you packing?

396
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:49,167
Your father and I are going to
take care of your grandfather today.

397
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:50,128
Grandfather?

398
00:23:50,687 --> 00:23:51,768
Isn't he at home?

399
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:53,288
Your grandfather is in the hospital.

400
00:23:54,088 --> 00:23:55,128
In the hospital?

401
00:23:56,207 --> 00:23:58,927
Is he okay? Which hospital is he in?
What happened to him?

402
00:23:59,407 --> 00:24:01,608
It's the hospital
across from our supermarket.

403
00:24:01,887 --> 00:24:02,808
I don't know either.

404
00:24:04,048 --> 00:24:06,288
He went for a check-up by himself.

405
00:24:06,608 --> 00:24:08,768
When he was at the hospital,
the doctor said

406
00:24:09,368 --> 00:24:11,328
it would be best to have
a comprehensive check-up.

407
00:24:11,727 --> 00:24:13,207
Then he called me.

408
00:24:14,207 --> 00:24:15,368
Your grandfather is aged now.

409
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:17,768
It's a good thing
to have a check-up in the hospital.

410
00:24:18,887 --> 00:24:20,407
I'll go with you.

411
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:25,200
(Hospitalization Department)

412
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:30,368
Grandpa, next time,
let any of us accompany you.

413
00:24:30,487 --> 00:24:31,848
Please don't come by yourself.

414
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:33,887
It's okay.

415
00:24:34,008 --> 00:24:35,687
It's just my students

416
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:38,247
who heard I hadn't
had a check-up in a long time.

417
00:24:38,368 --> 00:24:39,927
They insisted
that I stay here for a few days.

418
00:24:40,088 --> 00:24:42,207
Once all the check-ups are done,
I'll be discharged.

419
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:45,528
As long as you're fine.

420
00:24:45,768 --> 00:24:48,048
Grandpa, I'll see
if there's anything delicious outside.

421
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,848
- I'll get something for you.
- That's great.

422
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,088
I'm leaving.

423
00:24:51,528 --> 00:24:52,568
Don't buy just anything.

424
00:24:52,727 --> 00:24:53,368
I know.

425
00:24:53,487 --> 00:24:55,008
Here, Dad, have an orange.

426
00:24:55,647 --> 00:24:56,967
You go back too.

427
00:24:59,128 --> 00:25:00,647
(Which department is he in?)

428
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:02,808
(Which floor is it on?)

429
00:25:15,407 --> 00:25:15,927
Sheng.

430
00:25:26,687 --> 00:25:27,528
What a coincidence.

431
00:25:27,768 --> 00:25:28,727
What are you doing here?

432
00:25:28,948 --> 00:25:29,967
This is for hospitalization.

433
00:25:32,088 --> 00:25:33,288
My grandpa is here.

434
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:34,848
Your grandpa got hospitalized?

435
00:25:35,687 --> 00:25:38,328
He's fine. He's just here for a check-up
and will be discharged in a few days.

436
00:25:38,808 --> 00:25:40,368
My grandpa used to be a doctor,

437
00:25:40,447 --> 00:25:42,247
so he prefers to come here
by himself when he's ill.

438
00:25:42,568 --> 00:25:44,528
No matter his age,
he always comes alone.

439
00:25:44,687 --> 00:25:45,328
Which bed is he in?

440
00:25:46,207 --> 00:25:47,048
Bed nineteen.

441
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:53,808
Are you checking your patients?

442
00:25:54,407 --> 00:25:55,568
I came over for someone.

443
00:25:56,128 --> 00:25:57,447
My department's wards aren't here.

444
00:25:57,647 --> 00:25:58,528
I'm in cardiac surgery.

445
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,984
When will you go home?

446
00:26:05,328 --> 00:26:06,608
I guess I'll be heading back soon.

447
00:26:11,447 --> 00:26:15,288
- It's fine. Go ahead. Don't mind me.
- Okay.

448
00:26:17,288 --> 00:26:18,368
- Bye.
- Bye.

449
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:28,967
(Hospitalization Department)

450
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:30,687
Grandpa, you go ahead.
I'm heading back now.

451
00:26:34,816 --> 00:26:36,528
(Cardiac Surgery Department)

452
00:26:40,048 --> 00:26:42,687
(Should I go and say goodbye to him?)

453
00:27:07,048 --> 00:27:09,568
Dad, time for dinner.
Tomatoes and scrambled eggs.

454
00:27:09,568 --> 00:27:11,407
The doctor said it.
Drink some water first.

455
00:27:11,727 --> 00:27:12,288
Water.

456
00:27:12,368 --> 00:27:14,088
No, thanks. I can manage.

457
00:27:25,447 --> 00:27:26,048
You're back?

458
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:30,088
Calling you back
must have interrupted your date, huh?

459
00:27:32,687 --> 00:27:33,207
It's alright.

460
00:27:38,048 --> 00:27:38,927
You really had a date?

461
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:45,407
Is it the Miss Clam
from the call last time?

462
00:27:46,128 --> 00:27:46,967
Listen,

463
00:27:47,247 --> 00:27:49,048
even if the girl has a nice temper,

464
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,568
you still need to apologize to her.

465
00:27:52,808 --> 00:27:53,407
Really.

466
00:28:23,128 --> 00:28:24,368
Are you busy?

467
00:28:29,631 --> 00:28:31,745
(Voice message)

468
00:28:32,848 --> 00:28:34,768
Hold on. I just finished showering.

469
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:36,128
I'll just get dressed.

470
00:28:45,393 --> 00:28:46,928
(Mo Qingcheng)

471
00:28:51,727 --> 00:28:54,048
- Hello?
- Are you in a hurry to talk to me?

472
00:28:56,328 --> 00:28:57,128
Not really.

473
00:28:58,128 --> 00:29:02,167
- I forgot to ask you something.
- Go ahead.

474
00:29:11,288 --> 00:29:15,608
The song we recorded that day.

475
00:29:16,727 --> 00:29:19,247
You said it would be released
on Valentine's Day.

476
00:29:28,247 --> 00:29:28,887
Return With You?

477
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:31,727
Yes, Return With You.

478
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:33,288
What's wrong?

479
00:29:35,727 --> 00:29:41,447
- I'd like to know if you'll release it.
- Yes.

480
00:29:44,088 --> 00:29:47,247
(It seems a bit wrong
not to release a song recorded,)

481
00:29:48,128 --> 00:29:50,967
(but would it be
too showy to release it?)

482
00:29:51,727 --> 00:29:53,247
If you don't want to do so,
we can change

483
00:29:53,927 --> 00:29:55,808
to a different song, but they all know

484
00:29:55,848 --> 00:29:57,088
I planned to give a gift today.

485
00:29:57,207 --> 00:29:58,608
So, I have to release it.

486
00:30:01,528 --> 00:30:02,207
That's true.

487
00:30:03,328 --> 00:30:04,608
Do you have any existing arrangements?

488
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:07,447
Send it to me. How about I sing it?

489
00:30:09,687 --> 00:30:10,247
Sure.

490
00:30:12,128 --> 00:30:13,407
Let me think.

491
00:30:15,568 --> 00:30:18,808
The latest one on my computer
is Dawn and Dusk.

492
00:30:19,088 --> 00:30:20,167
Let's sing this one tonight.

493
00:30:20,727 --> 00:30:21,487
You do the harmony.

494
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:22,207
Okay.

495
00:30:25,288 --> 00:30:27,887
I recorded this song
by myself a few days ago.

496
00:30:28,008 --> 00:30:30,447
And I accompanied it
with my own guzheng playing.

497
00:30:30,768 --> 00:30:32,487
No major issues
with the accompaniment, I guess.

498
00:30:32,687 --> 00:30:34,447
Wait for a moment.
I'll process it a little more.

499
00:30:34,568 --> 00:30:36,288
I'll send it to you in half an hour.

500
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:40,167
Okay. Bye.

501
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:05,168
(Emergency, Outpatient)

502
00:31:42,207 --> 00:31:44,328
- Thanks.
- You're awake.

503
00:31:51,447 --> 00:31:52,687
You're not busy working overtime?

504
00:31:53,487 --> 00:31:54,207
I'm busy.

505
00:31:54,447 --> 00:31:56,128
But you are busier than me.

506
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:58,167
So I took some time
to come take care of you.

507
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:02,608
When are you going home?
Can you give me a ride?

508
00:32:03,967 --> 00:32:04,887
I'm waiting for something.

509
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:06,247
I won't have time to drive you home.

510
00:32:09,247 --> 00:32:09,768
Alright.

511
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:13,128
You're so heartless.

512
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:22,608
(Dawn and Dusk.WAV)

513
00:32:32,288 --> 00:32:34,167
The contract has been signed. Look.

514
00:32:34,368 --> 00:32:35,808
Check out my efficiency.

515
00:32:37,568 --> 00:32:39,288
Quite ceremonial.

516
00:32:39,927 --> 00:32:42,167
Signing the contract on February 14th.

517
00:32:42,288 --> 00:32:43,608
What do you mean by that?

518
00:32:43,768 --> 00:32:45,687
I told you I was doing it by the way.

519
00:32:45,808 --> 00:32:48,447
Don't associate everything
with Valentine's Day.

520
00:32:48,727 --> 00:32:49,328
Oh.

521
00:32:50,687 --> 00:32:52,687
What do you mean?

522
00:32:53,528 --> 00:32:56,608
I told you I was passing by her school.

523
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:59,687
And then, I took care of
my private and public affairs together.

524
00:33:00,887 --> 00:33:02,247
You don't need to report to me.

525
00:33:03,927 --> 00:33:06,207
Don't disturb a single young woman

526
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:08,727
to work peacefully on Valentine's Day.

527
00:33:08,848 --> 00:33:09,368
Thank you.

528
00:33:10,967 --> 00:33:13,727
No. Who is reporting to you? I...

529
00:33:14,687 --> 00:33:15,887
You are trying to disgust me.

530
00:33:15,887 --> 00:33:17,128
What's gotten into you today?

531
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:19,048
Did your brain get stimulated?

532
00:33:19,328 --> 00:33:20,528
Alright. I'm going to work now.

533
00:33:21,128 --> 00:33:22,368
Volunteering to work?

534
00:33:24,368 --> 00:33:25,328
What? Work...

535
00:33:25,328 --> 00:33:27,608
I'm happy. I'm cheerful.
Isn't it okay for me to work?

536
00:33:28,487 --> 00:33:29,247
Alright. I'm leaving.

537
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:34,608
Abnormal.

538
00:33:42,768 --> 00:33:44,727
(Sent. You can listen to it.)

539
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:49,088
(So quick. Was it done in one go?)

540
00:33:49,608 --> 00:33:50,368

Think about it.

591
00:36:25,207 --> 00:36:29,287
It means Linglong has been observing
in secret for a long time.

Troubled? Why should he?

When have you ever seen
Qiang Qingci like that?

598

Well, that's hard to say.

599

Look.

603
00:36:51,647 --> 00:36:54,807
If Qiang Qingci really
had something for Linglong,

604
00:36:55,207 --> 00:36:56,247
would he have waited for years?

605
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:57,807
Wouldn't he have done something by now?

- Alright, alright.
- What's more,

614
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:15,488
You scared me.

- Can't you stand to see newcomers?
- I...

618

Wow, wow.

I'll go there by myself tomorrow.

686
00:41:51,207 --> 00:41:51,767
That works too.

687
00:41:52,608 --> 00:41:54,847
We might come out of

I'm renting it with Juemei.

694
00:42:10,568 --> 00:42:11,847
It's not the place you went to.

695
00:42:23,888 --> 00:42:24,568
Hmm.

696
00:42:28,207 --> 00:42:28,888
Deal?

697
00:42:30,687 --> 00:42:32,767
Yeah. See you tomorrow.

You have to have some confidence.

705
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:20,968
No need to chase her every day.

706
00:43:21,528 --> 00:43:23,928
Even if he wants to do so,
it's not possible.

707
00:43:24,008 --> 00:43:27,008
Doctors have to
squeeze out time to date.

708
00:43:27,128 --> 00:43:29,287
Of course, he needs to date
if he has managed to get time off.

00:43:29,847 --> 00:43:30,408
I support you.

710
00:43:31,968 --> 00:43:33,647
Just don't forget to
give a heads-up in advance.

711
00:43:33,767 --> 00:43:35,247
Your professional characteristics.

712
00:43:35,928 --> 00:43:37,687
Don't get so busy
that you disappear for a whole day.

713
00:43:37,807 --> 00:43:38,847
Right when she is kissing you,

714
00:43:38,968 --> 00:43:40,968
a call comes and you have to leave.
Who could stand that?

715
00:43:43,247 --> 00:43:43,968
Experienced, huh?

716
00:43:45,008 --> 00:43:47,408
My theoretical experience
is quite substantial.

717
00:43:49,647 --> 00:43:51,968
By the way, after work tomorrow,
you all come to my place.

718
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:55,048
Wait. You two are dating

719
00:43:55,448 --> 00:43:56,488
and we are singing alongside.

720
00:43:59,687 --> 00:44:00,528
Afraid she may be shy.

721
00:44:00,647 --> 00:44:01,847
More at ease with more men.

722
00:44:03,008 --> 00:44:04,247
Okay. See you tomorrow.

723
00:44:04,327 --> 00:44:05,247
We will definitely go.

724
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:13,048
He wouldn't always
take us around like ornaments, would he?

725
00:44:14,048 --> 00:44:16,048
Just cherish the present.

726
00:44:16,247 --> 00:44:17,928
In the future
when they're dating smoothly,

727
00:44:18,048 --> 00:44:19,608
they may find you annoying
if you follow them.

728
00:44:22,488 --> 00:44:24,847
Why should I follow him
when he is in a relationship?

729
00:44:24,847 --> 00:44:25,367
How strange.

730
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:46,408
- I heard you went for a contract today.
- Yes.
