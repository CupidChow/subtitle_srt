25
00:01:41,844 --> 00:01:45,876
(Just the two of us visit the exhibit
on Valentine's Day.)

26
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,900
I sang several songs
when live streaming.

27
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,820
I brought you guys a lot of snacks.

28
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,379
Look, you must be tired
after live-streaming, right?

29
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:14,340
So many, see?

30
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:20,539
Pork jerky, dried mango, and chips.

31
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:28,060
Isn't there anything else
you want to tell us?

32
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:37,420
Stop staring at me.
Just recording a song for business.

33
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,900
That's it.

34
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,099
That's it?
My idol came to our live room.

35
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,620
Maybe...

36
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,779
He wanted to talk to me
about the song we recorded today.

37
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:54,699
And his phone died,
so he couldn't say it.

38
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,779
That must be the case.

39
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,064
Well, I'm going back to school. Bye.

40
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,219
I'll send you.

41
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:07,460
I haven't finished asking
and you're already leaving.

42
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,180
What? Bye. Bye. Bye.

43
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,740
You...

44
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,819
Bye. Bye. Bye.

45
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:11,460
Helmet.

46
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,580
Avoiding. She's definitely avoiding it.

47
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:22,819
While you were singing,

48
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:24,300
I checked up on Qiang Qingci.

49
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,499
No skeletons in the closet.
He's a nice person.

50
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,180
He's always been a good person.

51
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,620
Otherwise, he couldn't have been popular
for so many years.

52
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,819
It doesn't matter to me how he is.

53
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:36,848
I'm just worried about you
since you made new friends.

54
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:38,979
Now I'm reassured.

55
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:41,520
Let's go.

56
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,779
(Have you arrived at the dorm?)

57
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:58,460
Just sent.

00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,140
(I saw this.)

61
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,264
(It reminded me of the song
I kept listening to)

62
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:11,420
(for a campus movie)

63
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,259

68
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:33,180
The photo is from our school,
and the lyrics mention "Shengshengman."

69
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,899
If you say he's not into you,
I honestly won't buy it.

70
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,220
This is his alma mater.
Posting a photo is normal.

71
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,899
And there are many songs
with "Shengshengman" in the lyrics.

72
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:44,899
You don't believe me.
I'll find one for you.

73
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:46,379
Fine. I believe you, all right?

74
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:48,980
He has no interest in you indeed.

75
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,860
Taking a 20-ish stop bus ride back
is just out of politeness.

76
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,780
Posting on Weibo is for the alma mater.

77
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,180
The lyrics fitting is just.

78
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:59,139
A coincidence. A pure coincidence.

79
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:03,184
That's my alma mater.
I took a rare photo when I went back.

80
00:05:03,184 --> 00:05:04,499
Why are you all interpreting so much?

81
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:07,499
Alma mater. Alma mater.

82
00:05:07,499 --> 00:05:09,328
Trying to silence us?

83
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:11,740
Then...

84
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,499
Sour soup with pig's trotters
for tonight's supper.

85
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:18,019
Having another meal.

86
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,448
(Did he do it on purpose
or inadvertently?)

87
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,819
(If this goes on,
everyone will misunderstand.)

88
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,899
Smells really good.

89
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,740
I don't know whether I might
venture to ask you a question.

90
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,339
No, if it's a personal question.

91
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:05,699
But I just want to ask
this personal question today.

92
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:08,784
You're serious, huh?

93
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:11,259
What?

94
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:12,339
You know what I mean.

95
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:16,080
You know the answer. Then why ask?

96
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,180
I know the answer?

97
00:06:27,984 --> 00:06:29,339
Good. I will take a photo.

98
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,980
He made it.

99
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:47,540
Are you happy meeting Shengshengman?

100
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,579
Are you eating or not?

101
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,980
You can chat but don't always gossip.

102
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,060
Fine. No kidding.
Answer me a serious question.

103
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,100
When will you meet next time?

104
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,540
We probably won't meet again.

105
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,420
Impossible.

106
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,699
The song is done.

107
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:09,819
This is just the beginning.

108
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:11,620
We still have cooperation
with Perfect Voice.

109
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,780
You might meet again soon.

110
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,420
There's only one piece left.
Who will eat it?

111
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,420
Let me check. You've had four pieces.

112
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,699
Juemei ate four pieces.

113
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:44,819
Both of us had three pieces.

114
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,379
Enough. Stop talking. You eat it.

115
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,740
That would be so impolite.

116
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,019
Look? Didn't I tell you to stop talking?
Now there's none left.

117
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,540
Rarely found a chance
to ask Qiang Qingci to cook.

118
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,328
You were even being polite.
Fake courtesy.

119
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:09,180
We finally had the goods on Mr. Qiang.

120
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,620
We should blackmail him for a big meal.

121
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,339
We were dismissed

122
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:14,019
by this trotter soup. It's a big loss.

123
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:15,860
It's good enough
to have something to eat.

124
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:19,939
Zhou Zheng, when did he meet Sheng?

125
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:20,939
Haven't heard you mention it.

126
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,139
I don't know either.

127
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:24,259
Don't you two live together?

128
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:24,899
Indeed.

129
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:26,300
He hasn't told me even though we do.

130
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,259
Didn't you know to observe a bit?

131
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,872
What a waste.
Living together for nothing.

132
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:31,660
Enough.

133
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,780
Work after your meal.

134
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,900
I haven't eaten enough yet.

135
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,520
Stop nonsense.

136
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,619
Is there any more?

137
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,699
No more.

138
00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:42,140
Finish the soup.

139
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,160
(Wangjia Supermarket)

140
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:50,099
Seeing a doctor is hard.

141
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:51,339
Welcome.

142
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:53,339
I've been queuing till now
and haven't had lunch.

143
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,339
I'm so hungry. My head is spinning.
This bread is not bad.

144
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:57,020
Pretty good.

145
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,420
Which doctor's appointment did you make?

146
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,939
Mo Qingcheng.

147
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,619
Mo Qingcheng?
The doctor seems too young.

148
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:04,420
Why don't you
make an appointment with a specialist?

149
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,260
Although he's young,

150
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,420
many people recommended him to me.

151
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,180
I saw him today and it was really good.
Good medical skills.

152
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:11,459
Really?

153
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:12,944
His attitude is good. Very attentive.

154
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,540
Twelve.

155
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,500
Let me pay.

156
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,459
I'll pay.

157
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:19,859
See you next time.

158
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,900
Let's dig in. I'm so dizzy from hunger.

159
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,336
(Wangjia Supermarket)

160
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,140
Young boss. You look so happy.
Did you win a lottery?

161
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,020
No. I just heard them saying
which doctor is good.

162
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,739
The shop is right opposite the hospital.

163
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:43,699
Aren't you fed up
listening to it every day?

164
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:50,180
Listen, the most frequent visitors
to our shop are doctors,

165
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,900
patients and their families.

166
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,300
The words we often heard are

167
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,979
the long waiting list of beds,

168
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:58,739
the doctors' gossip,

169
00:09:58,739 --> 00:10:00,979
and something about
the specialist outpatient clinic.

170
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:02,699
And such, anyway.

171
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:05,739
By the way, are you leaving
when your cousin comes later?

172
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,660
Yes. I bought a movie ticket, at 7 PM.

173
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:10,800
Who are you with?

174
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:13,859
Me alone. A single ticket.

175
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,819
Alone? Let me know next time
and I'll go with you.

176
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:18,900
Okay. I'll call you next time.

177
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,219
Let me answer a WeChat message.

178
00:10:24,219 --> 00:10:26,140
Okay. Since there's no consumer,
you can go ahead.

179
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,864
Thank you.

180
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:39,420
Listen, our idol has been
really high-profile lately.

181
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,459
He released a song directly.
You know what the point is?

182
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:44,979
The point is he's included
Shengshengman in his lyrics.

183
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:47,380
How far have those two developed?

184
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:51,459
But, you know,
he's been so popular these past years.

185
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:54,699
Him being high-profile for once
might mean he's found true love.

186
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,420
I just love whatever relates to him.

187
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,540
As long as he likes her and he's happy,

188
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,060
I'm all for it. Listen, as long as

189
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,260
he doesn't get dumped tomorrow
after being together today.

190
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:16,099
(Doomed.)

191
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:20,979
(He can't speak.)

192
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:23,780
(Yiru will definitely recognize
his voice as Qiang Qingci.)

193
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:27,979
Hello.

194
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,939
Welcome.

195
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,339
What can I help you with?

196
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,619
I know!

197
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,260
I know what he's going to buy.

198
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,579
Over there.

199
00:11:54,739 --> 00:11:56,060
A regular customer?

200
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,020
Right. A regular customer
who comes every day.

201
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,819
Send your WeChat messages.

202
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,939
She's your fan. She would recognize
your voice as you speak.

203
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:18,180
Take whatever you like.

204
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,099
Tell you what. Shengshengman
just has too few fans.

205
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:23,739
She's even been mocked
for clinging to a big shot.

206
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:25,780
I was so angry back then.

207
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,380
She's a composer
who works behind the scenes.

208
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,020
How about going out?

209
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,459
I'll bring it to the front for you.

210
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,859
Anyway, I like whomever my idol likes.

211
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,060
I support him unconditionally.

212
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,859
Your fan seems to
have some misunderstandings.

213
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:00,420
I didn't tell her I am Shengshengman.

214
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:02,939
I know.

215
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:04,180
She's a huge fan of yours.

216
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,780
She has listened to all your shows.

217
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,339
And she's especially nice.

218
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:09,780
So, when I come to
the supermarket again in the future,

219
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,979
I can't say half a word.

220
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,699
If you don't want to be exposed,

221
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:18,300
and have your fans
come to the hospital to spectate,

222
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,739
I suggest you remain silent.

223
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:24,020
Alright. Silence is golden.

224
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,180
But it's not like
she's going to be here all the time.

225
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,099
My dad, my mom, and my cousin

226
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,979
will take turns staying here.

227
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:31,540
It's fine when the others are here.

228
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,619
Do you want anything else
besides drinks?

229
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:42,579
Boxed meals.
Your boxed meals are very good.

230
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:46,160
They are handmade by my mom.
Not wholesaled.

231
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,140
Definitely genuine.

232
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,939
Really? Auntie's craftsmanship
is truly impressive.

233
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:52,819
Wait here. I'll go get it.

234
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:53,540
My treat.

235
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:04,780
I come here often.

236
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,459
You can't treat me every day.

237
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:10,579
You treated me to bamboo shoot soup.
Now I should reciprocate.

238
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,020
Thank you.

239
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,780
Then let me get it.

240
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:16,976
(Business Hours)

241
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:22,020
Boxed meal.

242
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:36,459
Excuse me, please make way. Thank you.

243
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,300
Get a bag for these, and this.

244
00:14:51,979 --> 00:14:53,939
But you have to
keep track of these things.

245
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:55,619
Otherwise, your mom will ask.

246
00:14:55,619 --> 00:14:57,380
Just record them.
You can say I ate them all.

247
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,619
Got it. Indeed, he's pretty handsome.

248
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,339
Whether he is handsome or not
has nothing to do with me.

249
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,380
Yet you feed him with your own goods.

250
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,939
He treated me to a meal last time.

251
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:12,660
This is me reciprocating. Bye.

252
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,099
Reciprocating? What was she taking?

253
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:26,500
Cousin! You're here.

254
00:15:28,619 --> 00:15:30,352
What do you need that bag for, Sheng?

255
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:31,979
Snacks.

256
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,540
Cousin, is your moped dead?

257
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,699
Let me go get you a power strip.

258
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,500
No, thanks. I charged it yesterday.

259
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,660
A charge lasts over 100 kilometers.

260
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,739
It can still go a long way.

261
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:43,900
Okay, then I'm leaving.

262
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,979
Wait a moment.

263
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:47,472
Isn't that the doctor
you were into last time?

264
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:51,780
I was not into anyone. I think he's nice
as he protected his colleagues.

265
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,300
And I wanted to give him a discount.

266
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,979
Then the physiognomy...

267
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:56,619
What physiognomy? You can go.

268
00:15:56,619 --> 00:15:57,979
I'll go now. Bye-bye.

269
00:15:57,979 --> 00:15:58,739
Be careful.

270
00:15:58,739 --> 00:15:59,660
Bye-bye.

271
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:03,300
Dong Yiru.

272
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:19,260
Come here.

273
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,780
I saw you defending your colleague
at the hospital entrance last time.

274
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,060
I joked about it with my cousin.

275
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,792
He was talking nonsense.
Just ignore him.

276
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:35,260
You saw it?

277
00:16:37,739 --> 00:16:41,060
Yes. That was my fifth cousin.

278
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,859
Fifth cousin? You have a lot of cousins?

279
00:16:43,859 --> 00:16:45,900
Yes, five of them. He's the youngest.

280
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,339
This is the boxed meal.
And a lot of snacks.

281
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:53,579
They are all delicious. Try some.

282
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:54,459
That's a lot.

283
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,040
Thank you.

284
00:17:03,219 --> 00:17:04,859
It's time for you
to go back to the hospital.

285
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,336
I still have some time. What about you?

286
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,099
I don't have classes this week.
I'm helping out in the store.

287
00:17:14,379 --> 00:17:16,579
So, you are available now?

288
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:18,896
Yes.

289
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,099
Let me treat you to coffee.

290
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:24,859
Bubble tea is also fine.

291
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,260
Bubble tea.

292
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,859
I see there's a bubble tea shop ahead.

293
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:33,619
Let's go for it.

294
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,768
Let's go.

295
00:17:47,796 --> 00:17:49,659
(Wangjia Supermarket)

296
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:51,300
Your cousin's boyfriend-to-be.

297
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:51,859
Him?

298
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,700
How handsome. You don't approve of him?

299
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,300
It's not that.

300
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,220
I'm just curious how they met.

301
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:03,899
Simply by shopping, right?

302
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:05,819
Buy a drink today,
and a boxed meal tomorrow.

303
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:07,139
It led to familiarity, didn't it?

304
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,260
How come no one is familiar with me?

305
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,060
I'm not bad-looking, either.

306
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,700
Why not reflect on yourself?

307
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:30,700
We eat at night...

308
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,579
Dr. Mo.

309
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:33,139
Dr. Mo.

310
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:33,980
Working the night shift?

311
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,500
Yes.

312
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:36,700
See you.

313
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,819
Let's go.

314
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:40,139
Hurry up. Look.

315
00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:40,752
Do you see it?

316
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:44,819
I'm also working the night shift.

317
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,220
It's really tough.
There are doctors in my family, too.

318
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,819
Both my grandparents are doctors.

319
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:53,540
Sometimes they're not even around
for New Year's Eve dinner.

320
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,020
Will you be here tonight?

321
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,859
Yes. What?

322
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:08,099
Just asking. Maybe I'll bump into you
if I come over tonight.

323
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:10,579
I see.

324
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,179
That should be possible.

325
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,179
Well, I have to go.

326
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,379
Bye-bye.

327
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:18,992
Bye-bye.

328
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:27,920
(Please cross at the zebra crossing)

329
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,940
What are you looking at?
Why aren't you going home?

330
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,700
I'm staying to work the night shift.

331
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,500
Why? Aren't you going to the movie?

332
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,220
No. It's too crowded.
I don't want to watch.

333
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,859
Don't watch it as it's crowded?

334
00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:56,379
It smells so good.

335
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:00,260
No one's here.

336
00:20:10,484 --> 00:20:12,944
(Wangjia Supermarket)

337
00:20:19,139 --> 00:20:19,740
He's coming.

338
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,179
Who's coming?

339
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:20,780
Look.

340
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,220
Is he coming to our store?

341
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:29,460
He entered.

342
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,099
Hello, welcome. May I help you?

343
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:40,500
I know! I know what you want.

344
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,379
I know. You don't need to talk.

345
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,859
So strict. She doesn't
even allow him to talk to girls.

346
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,220
Work. What are you doing here?

347
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,500
Go to work. What are you doing?

348
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:05,659
Grab a bag.

349
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:16,899
Just take a quick look.

350
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:25,819
54.5 and a 15-yuan boxed meal.

351
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:28,060
Total is 69.5.
How would you like to pay?

352
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:30,608
Okay.

353
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,020
Please wait for a while.

354
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:41,179
Here's your receipt. Thank you.

355
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,780
Why isn't this guy talking today?
What does that mean?

356
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,460
Stop looking. Go to work.

357
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,300
Stop looking.

358
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,260
(Moqingcheng)
(No time for chit chat. Talk later.)

359
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,819
Peanut.

360
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:01,300
I

361
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:05,500
like someone's voice.

362
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:11,500
But now, I kind of feel...

363
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,659
It seems he feels
something for me as well.

364
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:22,300
Am I overthinking?

365
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,060
If I've overthought,
it would be awkward, wouldn't it?

366
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:34,780
It would be awkward if I've overthought.

367
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:40,020
Forget it. You wouldn't understand it.

368
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,460
It is so late. You want me
to get scolded with you.

369
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,608
I can't keep on eating
if I can't fall asleep this late.

370
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,780
What should I do?

371
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,379
What about having some fruit?

372
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:03,984
Go.

373
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:16,099
Shengshengman.

374
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:20,460
No shouting my nickname in public.

375
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,940
Treat me to a meal.

376
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,300
Again?

377
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,819
Your school has been completely exposed.

378
00:24:24,819 --> 00:24:26,419
What if everyone organizes

379
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:28,060
an event to find Shengshengman?

380
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,260
You'll have to buy my silence.

381
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:33,540
Valentine's Day is coming, Sheng.

382
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:37,579
Yeah, Valentine's Day
is around the corner.

383
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:41,940
Okay. We can consider it
as a Valentine's gift for the fans.

384
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,020
Right. Valentine's Day is coming soon.

385
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,859
How about "Return With You"?

386
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:49,460
Are you thinking of Qiang Qingci?

387
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:51,859
No.

388
00:24:53,899 --> 00:24:54,500
I'll take a call.

389
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:04,179
(Hi.)

390
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:09,020
(I want to ask about that song.)

391
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,300
Let's go.

392
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:19,888
Let's go.

393
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:25,899
Dr. Mo, you just finished checking?

394
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:29,260
Yes. Bed number three and bed number ten
can be discharged tomorrow.

395
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,899
Great. Their family members
ask me every day.

396
00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:32,220
I'll go my rounds this morning. See you.

397
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:32,848
Okay.

398
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,339
Excuse me, I want that fish.

399
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:35,920
Okay.

400
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,179
Thank you.

401
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:41,680
Okay.

402
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,099
Sheng, let's sit over there.

403
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:44,300
Okay.

404
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:44,980
I'll get a drink.

405
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,899
Mr. Mo, I'm going to the ward.

406
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:53,488
There you go.

407
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:56,208
(Hi.)

408
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,819
There's a games carnival.
Do you want to go?

409
00:26:26,139 --> 00:26:29,980
I have always wanted to see it.

410
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,260
I have never been there.

411
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,339
But, aren't you very busy?

412
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,220
I'm not busy that day.

413
00:26:52,659 --> 00:26:53,619
Did the tutor need you?

414
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:56,220
No.

415
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:09,200
Okay.

416
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,980
Alright. I will pick you up on Sunday.

417
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:21,899
(Okay.)

418
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:24,899
Sunday.

419
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:31,600
(14th. Sunday. Valentine's Day)

420
00:27:32,379 --> 00:27:35,540
(Sunday. February 14th.
Valentine's Day.)

421
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,060
What's wrong? Is everything okay?

422
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,819
Nothing.

423
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,300
Is the rice so delicious?

424
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,260
Eat your vegetables, Sheng.

425
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:44,540
I'm exhausted and you can still laugh.

426
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,139
It's not your first day knowing
that we're busy in Cardiothoracic.

427
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:52,940
Have you scheduled the weekend?

428
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,339
Off.

429
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:55,540
Just in time for Valentine's Day.

430
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,220
I planned to have a meal
with other department's singles.

431
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,300
After all, it's a festival. Come along.

432
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:03,419
I will pass. I have plans that day.

433
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:09,260
Valentine's Day. Something happened?

434
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:13,700
Mr. Zhou.

435
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:13,940
Hello.

436
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,139
Looking sharp today.

437
00:29:15,139 --> 00:29:16,500
When do I not look smart?

438
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:22,379
Zhou Zheng, perfect timing.

439
00:29:22,379 --> 00:29:24,540
Here is the collaboration agreement
with that app.

440
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,980
Could you deliver it when you have time?

441
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,020
I've already signed and sealed it.

442
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,060
Just find a deliveryman.

443
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,139
Why me?

444
00:29:30,139 --> 00:29:32,819
No. You must drive it there.
It's not far anyway.

445
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,099
Fine. I'll let her know.

446
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,819
(Xingfu, are you free to meet?)

447
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,339
(What do you want to meet for?)

448
00:29:55,339 --> 00:29:57,940
(Of course, to discuss the contract.)

449
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,220
So, it's about the contract.
Just send it by courier.

450
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:11,619
That's what I said, silly Doudou.

451
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,379
Or how about Sunday?
I just happen to be going downtown then.

452
00:30:20,379 --> 00:30:21,740
Let's get in touch then.

453
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,339
Sunday?

454
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,696
(Okay.)

455
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,020
Which day of the week is Sunday?
What date is it?

456
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:47,440
(14th. Valentine's Day)

457
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,619
No way.

458
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:57,020
It can't be.

459
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,659
What's up?

460
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:06,579
Doudou, would you meet alone
with a regular friend

461
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:08,339
on Valentine's Day?

462
00:31:10,099 --> 00:31:11,339
I'm not interested in you.

463
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:14,099
What do you mean?
I'm not interested in you either.

464
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,320
We're back.

465
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,980
Zhou Zheng, is there any coffee left?

466
00:31:26,899 --> 00:31:29,260
Dressed so smartly?
Not a single cup left.

467
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,940
What about the milk?
Why is there no milk?

468
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,819
I used it for coffee this morning.

469
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:39,940
So how do I make my coffee?

470
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,980
Just make do with the instant stuff.

471
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,832
What's going on here?

472
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:55,892
Missing a girl?

473
00:31:58,619 --> 00:31:59,780
It's not that simple.

474
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:01,859
How so?

475
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:03,899
No? Tell us in detail.

476
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:04,819
I'm all ears.

477
00:32:04,819 --> 00:32:05,500
Feel free to speak.

478
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,260
An attentive listener.

479
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,664
Listener. Listeners get their share.

480
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:10,260
Strive for improvement.

481
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,500
Improvement... You got me.

482
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,740
Off you go. You two can leave.

483
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,379
Don't bother me.

484
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,419
Come on. Tell us.

485
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,099
Fine. There's a secret now.

486
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:21,500
How hypocritical.

487
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,819
Imposing on someone.

488
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:28,060
Someone makes it harder for someone.

489
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,139
Isn't that a detour then? Again.

490
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,740
It's sent out.

491
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:39,099
Sorry. Wang Ke played with my phone

492
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:40,500
and sent a blank message.

493
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,300
Who played with your phone?
You deceived.

494
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:50,099
Never mind. I am free only that day.
Are you okay with it?

495
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:57,616
Yes. See you then.

496
00:32:57,616 --> 00:32:58,179
Then I...

497
00:32:58,179 --> 00:32:59,579
Geng Xiaoxing.

498
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:05,260
I want to share a juicy gossip with you.

499
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,419
Go ahead. What's the gossip?

500
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:11,740
This Sunday, that man
is planning to meet with Sheng.

501
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,020
They seem to be making great progress.
Going on a date again.

502
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,460
Is that all you have to say?

503
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,179
Well, what else should I react with?

504
00:33:19,179 --> 00:33:22,740
It's Valentine's Day this Sunday.

505
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,780
They are indeed going out for a date.

506
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:32,379
Yes. I'm so excited.

507
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:34,579
They are dating on Valentine's Day.

508
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,859
Could it be that Qiang
is going to confess his love?

509
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:38,980
Or is it Sheng who's going to confess?

510
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,060
Regardless of who confesses,
it's bound to be successful.

511
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,859
Oh, no. There's a big misunderstanding.

512
00:33:47,956 --> 00:33:49,700
(14th. Valentine's Day)

513
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,659
Finally, Valentine's Day is here.

514
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:55,899
You even mark it.
Do you also have a date?

515
00:33:55,899 --> 00:33:56,500
No, I don't.

516
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,540
What's up? You do?

517
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,584
I don't.

518
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,060
Yet, you're grinning.

519
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,340
You are already a well-known singer
with two million fans.

520
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,619
Can't you sort out
your personal problems?

521
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,259
Do you really have the nerve
to say that to me?

522
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,659
Aren't you also famous
in the traditional music circle?

523
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:17,420
Well-off and even investing, huh?

524
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,340
Aren't you single as well?

525
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,380
I'm happy.

526
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:19,940
I'm happy too.

527
00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:24,460
♪If you're happy and you know it,
clap your hands♪

528
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,380
♪If you're happy and you know it,
clap your hands♪

529
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,219
What's making you so cheerful?

530
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:31,380
It's a festival.

531
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,099
A festival.

532
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,460
Mr. Mo, what shall we cook tonight?

533
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,980
I'm going home tonight
and won't live here.

534
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,980
You're not living here?

535
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,099
Go on being happy.

536
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,259
Goodbye, Doudou.

537
00:34:47,259 --> 00:34:47,779
Bye-bye.

538
00:34:47,779 --> 00:34:48,336
Bye-bye.

539
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:51,820
His relationship
is developing too rapidly.

540
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,219
I can't keep up with the pace anymore.

541
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:56,820
Suddenly, being single
doesn't seem so joyful.

542
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:00,219
But you have to understand.

543
00:35:00,219 --> 00:35:01,616
Mr. Mo is at that age.

544
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:04,540
The oldest is still lying inside.

545
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,420
And he's also single.

546
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,299
That makes sense.

547
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,619
You're leaving?

548
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:11,619
I'll go out.

549
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:12,739
Then, tonight I might...

550
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:14,060
Not come back as well?

551
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,420
I might return late.

552
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,340
It's the weekend, so I go to meet
a classmate for a meal.

553
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:24,099
I'm off. Bye-bye.

554
00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:25,060
So annoying.

555
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,340
What happened? Did he drop something?

556
00:35:37,299 --> 00:35:38,659
Delivering a contract by the way.

557
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,739
What? Don't associate
everything with Valentine's Day.

558
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:44,259
Bye-bye.

559
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,820
One, two, three. Three, two, one.

560
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,420
I'm not happy either.

561
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,099
Wanting to be happy is simple. Wait.

562
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:58,940
Mao, here comes a job.

563
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,592
(Girl's Dorm No. 3)

564
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,179
(What if he didn't know
today is Valentine's Day)

565
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:15,699
(and happened to choose this day? )

566
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:23,856
(Girl's Dorm)

567
00:36:26,516 --> 00:36:27,696
(Girl's Dorm No. 3)

568
00:36:27,696 --> 00:36:28,299
For you.

569
00:36:28,299 --> 00:36:29,500
Have you been waiting long?

570
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,160
No.

571
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,980
You waited for a while.

572
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,940
What shall we eat tonight?

573
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,900
I just got here. Hot pot.

574
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,299
Hot pot.

575
00:36:37,299 --> 00:36:37,900
Anywhere you like.

576
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,779
No. Let's choose another.

577
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,860
Who are you waiting for?

578
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,420
Gu Sheng.

579
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,500
Gu Sheng.

580
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,940
Mr. Mo. Senior.

581
00:36:55,259 --> 00:36:58,820
Mo Qingcheng, this is
my junior from university.

582
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,060
You're my senior from high school.

583
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,179
You're my junior from university.

584
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,672
So how should you two sort out
your seniority from now on?

585
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,659
It should start from you.

586
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:14,500
I'll call her sister-in-law.

587
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,420
Is everything ready?

588
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,344
Then we are leaving.

589
00:37:19,344 --> 00:37:20,380
Senior, take care.

590
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:22,739
Senior, goodbye.

591
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:23,344
Let's go.

592
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:28,219
Is your backpack heavy?
Do you need help?

593
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,160
No, thanks.

594
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,420
What's wrong?

595
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:40,940
When I see you, I remember
that I still owe someone a lot of music.

596
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,879
Thinking about composing.

597
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
There must be many people today.

598
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,179
There are many people on weekends,
and today is even Valentine's Day.

599
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:55,420
So I drove here.

600
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:58,619
It's crowded everywhere today.

601
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:00,784
Without a car, it might be
inconvenient to send you home tonight.

602
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,139
No need. There are subway stations
and bus stops near my home.

603
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:06,659
It's very convenient.

604
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,900
Get in the car first.
Don't worry about going home now.

605
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,940
(I'm so awkward to bring up
Valentine's Day by myself just now.)

606
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,779
Still holding the bag?

607
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,664
Give it to me.

608
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:38,099
Is there anything fragile or water?

609
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:38,619
No.

610
00:38:44,259 --> 00:38:45,020
Seat belt.

611
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,980
It will take a long time on the way.

612
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,540
If you're thirsty, there's water here.

613
00:39:13,179 --> 00:39:13,820
Let's hit the road.

614
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,900
Do we all meet there?

615
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:39,060
I mean, besides you and me,
Doudou and Juemei.

616
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,900
Only you and me.

617
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:45,619
They are all busy today.

618
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:51,579
They are so busy at weekends.

619
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:56,179
Yeah. I don't know what happened today.

620
00:39:57,219 --> 00:39:59,739
I saw no one early in the morning.

621
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,420
Probably they all
went out and celebrated the festival.

622
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,420
It's possible.

623
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,060
(On Valentine's Day, just the two of us
visit the exhibition.)

624
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,179
Dongfeng.

625
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:31,099
Dongfeng.

626
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:34,259
- I'll go now. Happy Valentine's Day.
- Have a good festival.

627
00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:36,739
- Bye-bye.
- Happy Valentine's Day.

628
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:39,900
Why do I spend
every Valentine's Day with you guys?

629
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,619
Any opinions? Keep it.

630
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:43,940
I promised to go shopping
with my wife today.

631
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,060
Y-You could tell us earlier.

632
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,420
You can go now.

633
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,579
You should have said it earlier.

634
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,500
She's already out for a facial
with her bestie.

635
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,139
Dongfeng.

636
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:53,659
I had a date but I canceled it.

637
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,420
Isn't it enough
to play mahjong with you?

638
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,179
What date did you have?

639
00:40:57,179 --> 00:41:01,659
The second daughter
of my mom's former bestie. A blind date.

640
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,340
I'm too embarrassed to say it.

641
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,619
Hongzhong.

642
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:08,060
Every time she broke up,
I was the big brother who consoled her.

643
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,060
It is too intimate,
so it is impossible to date her.

644
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,219
So close. You can introduce me.

645
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:23,739
What's wrong with me?
I'm single and free of any encumbrances.

646
00:41:23,739 --> 00:41:25,259
I don't mess around.
I have a stable job.

647
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:28,579
Except for Mao, who isn't like that?

648
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:34,820
Fine. Let's cheer for our single life
and keep each other company.

649
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,820
When we get old,
we can put out a sign that says

650
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,820
"Tianzi No. 1 Senior Apartment."

651
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,060
Single apartment. Baiban.

652
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,500
Dr. Mo, it's been a long time.
How rare it is for you to drive back.

653
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,139
I have the day off today. Thank you.

654
00:41:58,139 --> 00:41:59,020
Alright. See you.

655
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,940
(Is this where he lives?)

656
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:10,860
This is where I live.

657
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:12,900
What's wrong?

658
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:16,340
You live here?

659
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,259
This is my residential area.
Of course, I live here.

660
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:25,179
(Aren't we to visit an exhibit?
How did we end up at his place?)

661
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,340
Thank you.

662
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,000
Have you been here?

663
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,179
No, I just think

664
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:42,980
you wouldn't let anyone know
your residential address easily.

665
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,340
After all, you don't even
post your photos online.

666
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,980
I indeed wouldn't let outsiders know.

667
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,699
The recording studio
is closer to the hospital,

668
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:55,060
so I often stay there too.

669
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,259
I also rented a place with Juemei.

670
00:42:57,259 --> 00:42:58,940
I stay there on weekends.

671
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,099
This is where my parents live.

672
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:02,540
Because it's close to
the exhibition hall.

673
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,380
Parking is convenient.

674
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:10,299
So you've been living here
since you were a kid.

675
00:43:10,299 --> 00:43:11,056
Right.

676
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:13,940
It's quite quiet.

677
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:16,980
Do you want to
write down my phone number?

678
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,779
In case we get separated when packed.
It would be easier to find each other.
