(Thank you for escorting me
back to school today.)

26
00:01:46,262 --> 00:01:48,861
Let's get a feel
before we officially start recording.

27
00:01:50,782 --> 00:01:51,982
Save your energy for later.

28
00:01:53,622 --> 00:01:54,461
Mao.

29
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:56,902
Yes?

30
00:01:57,021 --> 00:02:00,182
We'll start from the Section B.

31
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:01,661
- Okay.
- Section B.

32
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:02,182
Okay.

33
00:02:02,262 --> 00:02:03,741
Let's first try the chorus.

34
00:02:04,182 --> 00:02:05,381

(He doesn't need
to look at the lyrics at all.)

40
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:29,222

is just to make me more accustomed.)

57
00:03:28,102 --> 00:03:30,222
Sheng, don't be nervous.

58
00:03:30,382 --> 00:03:30,901
Although I know

59
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:32,262
suddenly being looked at by Mr. Mo

60
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:33,861
may indeed make it hard for you
to stay calm,

61
00:03:34,502 --> 00:03:36,382
you just need to get used to it.

62
00:03:36,502 --> 00:03:37,502
That's enough.

63
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:40,702
Let's do an official recording.

64
00:03:40,822 --> 00:03:42,422
Sheng, don't be nervous.

65
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:44,542
Then we'll check out
where it needs improvement

66
00:03:44,662 --> 00:03:45,822
and fix it, alright?

67
00:03:46,382 --> 00:03:47,142
Wait a moment.

68
00:03:47,382 --> 00:03:49,341
I actually think
the chorus part is quite good.

69
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:52,021
You sing "We drink from the same cup".

70
00:03:52,502 --> 00:03:53,936
I sing "And we share joy and sorrow".

71
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,461
This is like a dialogue.

72
00:03:58,341 --> 00:03:59,901
See? He's so professional.

73
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:00,702
Right.

74
00:04:01,822 --> 00:04:04,502
By the way, don't forget that
during Section B,

75
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:07,021
- we take turns singing.
- Okay.

76
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:11,021
Let's do it one more time.

77
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:13,781

What's this?

111
00:06:58,382 --> 00:07:00,021
This is cheating.

112
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:01,781

Okay, done.

136
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:54,941
Awesome, Mo Qingcheng.
Your monologue is brilliant.

137
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:57,222
I think as soon
as this version is released,

138
00:08:57,382 --> 00:08:59,742
it will instantly overshadow
all the previous covers.

139
00:08:59,862 --> 00:09:00,462
I agree.

140
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,862
I bet if this version is released,
the download and play counts

141
00:09:02,982 --> 00:09:04,262
will break the record in three hours.

142
00:09:04,421 --> 00:09:06,301
You really underestimate him.

143
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,382
I bet it'll break the record
in just one hour.

144
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:11,661
Alright.

145
00:09:13,222 --> 00:09:14,102
What do you think?

146
00:09:14,982 --> 00:09:15,941
It's perfect.

147
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,862
I mean,

148
00:09:19,982 --> 00:09:24,262
your singing and monologue
are all incredibly perfect.

149
00:09:26,021 --> 00:09:26,502
Thank you.

150
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:29,701
Sheng, how is it? Are you touched?

151
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,301
Your heart must be beating fast.

152
00:09:32,301 --> 00:09:34,941
I'm a guy, and I can hardly contain
my excitement, let alone a girl.

153
00:09:35,502 --> 00:09:36,742
You two bad guys.

154
00:09:37,181 --> 00:09:37,781
What's up?

155
00:09:39,102 --> 00:09:39,661
Nothing.

156
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:44,262
- Let's go out and take a break.
- Okay.

157
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:47,021
Here they come.

158
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:54,582
Tell me,

159
00:09:54,742 --> 00:09:57,142
you've had the lines prepared, right?

160
00:09:57,301 --> 00:09:59,462
You waited for Sheng to come
so you could say them to her.

161
00:09:59,582 --> 00:10:00,462
I think so.

162
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:02,982
Alright. No more joking.

163
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:04,661
Otherwise, Sheng will think
it is a den of wolves

164
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:05,712
and not dare to come again.

165
00:10:06,502 --> 00:10:08,342
Mao, what do you think?
Is this version good?

166
00:10:09,102 --> 00:10:09,901
It's pretty good,

167
00:10:10,262 --> 00:10:13,742
especially those lines
you improvised on the spot.

168
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:17,262
Sheng, have some water first.

169
00:10:17,382 --> 00:10:18,541
There are some lines

170
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,301
that we might need
to sing separately later.

171
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:21,821
Okay.

172
00:10:25,862 --> 00:10:26,382
Over there.

173
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:33,541
Great.

174
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:36,021
It's so impressive.

175
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:40,742
Do you need anything?

176
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:44,021
- I'd like a cup of water.
- Okay.

177
00:10:50,781 --> 00:10:51,701
Be careful. It's hot.

178
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:52,382
Thank you.

179
00:10:52,382 --> 00:10:53,622
The environment here is good, right?

180
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:57,502
This is my first time
in such a big recording studio.

181
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:04,661
Shengshengman?

182
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:08,222
Don't worry. I'll keep it secret.

183
00:11:08,382 --> 00:11:09,342
It's professional ethics.

184
00:11:09,622 --> 00:11:11,862
I'm the new intern here.
My name is Xiyou.

185
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:14,021
I just heard

186
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,742
you were singing with Mr. Mo.

187
00:11:19,301 --> 00:11:20,781
You're the one who...

188
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:23,421
I'm the one who made the Weibo post.

189
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:26,982
How did you come to know Mr. Mo?

190
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:32,742
I just ran into him.

191
00:11:34,382 --> 00:11:36,661
(I can't exactly say that one morning,)

192
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:38,862
(he somehow entered my audio room)

193
00:11:38,862 --> 00:11:40,142
(and taught me to cook, right?)

194
00:11:40,862 --> 00:11:43,342
You can't tell me. I get it.

195
00:11:45,502 --> 00:11:46,222
I have another...

196
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:46,862
Shengshengman,

197
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:50,301
it's your turn now.

198
00:11:52,342 --> 00:11:52,982
Thank you.

199
00:11:57,021 --> 00:11:58,102
Should I go in now?

200
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:00,622
Sorry, I was late today.

201
00:12:02,982 --> 00:12:04,982
I thought you weren't coming today.

202
00:12:06,262 --> 00:12:07,502
I almost couldn't make it.

203
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:12,301
- Is it because of work?
- Yes.

204
00:12:17,181 --> 00:12:18,061
Are you whispering?

205
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:19,742
No, not at all.

206
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:21,222
I was drinking water, and he called me.

207
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:23,781
You don't have to explain it to me.

208
00:12:23,941 --> 00:12:26,382
You two have one more minute
before wrapping up, okay?

209
00:12:32,382 --> 00:12:34,382
- I'll go in first.
- Okay.

210
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:42,382
How is it?

211
00:12:43,661 --> 00:12:45,901
- Let her prepare first, Mao.
- Okay.

212
00:12:46,102 --> 00:12:48,821
She simply went out to drink water,
and he followed.

213
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:49,982
He was afraid she would leave.

214
00:12:50,821 --> 00:12:52,821
She wouldn't.
Her backpack is still here.

215
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:54,102
It's so heavy.

216
00:12:54,781 --> 00:12:56,781
Her bag is so heavy,
and she still brought us snacks.

217
00:12:56,862 --> 00:12:57,982
She is so nice.

218
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:00,112
I think the backpack
is also full of food.

219
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,320
It must be stuffed by her parents
as she is returning to school.

220
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,021
It happened to me before. My parents
prepared a huge bag of food for me back then.

221
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:06,181
I was exhausted.

222
00:13:07,262 --> 00:13:08,901
I didn't carry a backpack
when I was in school.

223
00:13:09,061 --> 00:13:09,982
Yeah.

224
00:13:10,342 --> 00:13:12,181
That's why
I didn't get to eat any snacks from you.

225
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:13,181
It is quite heavy.

226
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:17,181
- Mao, shall we start?
- Okay.

227
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:22,142
With him supervising,
it will take at least 20 rounds.

228
00:13:22,941 --> 00:13:25,061
I guess it won't be done
any sooner than 6 PM.

229
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,862
I'll go find something to eat first.

230
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:27,982
I'm starving.

231
00:13:28,502 --> 00:13:29,301
I'm going too.

232
00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:32,421
- I'll take a nap somewhere.
- I'll go to the bathroom.

233
00:13:34,462 --> 00:13:35,181
Keep going.

234
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,821
Close the door.

235
00:13:38,262 --> 00:13:41,821
Sheng, let's work hard
and finish it in one go.

236
00:13:41,982 --> 00:13:43,142
So you won't have to come back.

237
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:44,582
Okay, no problem.

238
00:13:45,622 --> 00:13:47,382
Keep going. Let's get started.

239
00:14:24,301 --> 00:14:25,901
Sheng, overall, it's pretty good.

240
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:28,821
- Try to tone down your emotions a bit.
- Okay.

241
00:14:29,941 --> 00:14:30,382
Keep going.

242
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:55,982
Mr. Mo,

243
00:14:57,061 --> 00:15:00,622
from my perspective
as a professional singer,

244
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:02,701
this is already very good.

245
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:05,502
I think it's already perfect.

246
00:15:06,622 --> 00:15:07,622
I am okay with it either.

247
00:15:13,382 --> 00:15:15,301
Sheng, this version is good enough.

248
00:15:15,742 --> 00:15:17,021
Really? Is it really good?

249
00:15:17,982 --> 00:15:18,781
It's excellent.

250
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:19,941
Everyone thinks it's good.

251
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:21,582
Good job. You can come out now.

252
00:15:22,862 --> 00:15:23,862
Okay, thank you.

253
00:15:25,781 --> 00:15:27,262
Good job. Great.

254
00:15:27,502 --> 00:15:28,502
- It's very good.
- Right.

255
00:15:28,502 --> 00:15:29,102
It is not easy.

256
00:15:29,102 --> 00:15:30,742
Why does it sound so good?

257
00:15:34,862 --> 00:15:35,502
Great job.

258
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,742
Well done.

259
00:15:36,982 --> 00:15:37,781
You sang it so well.

260
00:15:37,781 --> 00:15:39,742
Take a rest. You must be tired.

261
00:15:39,862 --> 00:15:41,862
His standards are usually high.

262
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:43,901
You'll get used to it.
Don't mind. You sang really well.

263
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:45,584
I did what I should do.

264
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,061
See?

265
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,901
You two are definitely perfectionists.

266
00:15:50,021 --> 00:15:51,382
I'm starving.

267
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:53,382
All I can think about

268
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:55,421
is hot pot, barbecue, and grilled meat.

269
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,061
I feel even more hungry now.

270
00:15:57,061 --> 00:16:00,222
You don't understand.
It is what we call a spiritual exchange.

271
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:02,701
All good relationships

272
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:05,901
have to start
with the exchange of beautiful voices.

273
00:16:06,262 --> 00:16:07,222
Stop nagging.

274
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,421
I heard that you had been communicating
for two months

275
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:11,742
before deciding to meet offline.

276
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:14,701
Can't Sheng shut you up
with all the food she brought?

277
00:16:15,421 --> 00:16:16,342
I almost forgot.

278
00:16:17,021 --> 00:16:17,582
Sheng,

279
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:19,382
do you have time tonight
to have dinner with us?

280
00:16:19,502 --> 00:16:20,742
Tonight?

281
00:16:21,301 --> 00:16:22,941
Tonight, I have to return to school.

282
00:16:23,102 --> 00:16:25,061
I probably won't be able
to have dinner with all of you.

283
00:16:26,742 --> 00:16:29,552
This is your first time here,
and you are in our studio.

284
00:16:29,552 --> 00:16:31,262
Letting you leave
on an empty stomach isn't good.

285
00:16:31,462 --> 00:16:32,421
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

286
00:16:32,502 --> 00:16:34,742
This isn't our way of treating guests.

287
00:16:34,982 --> 00:16:35,821
You are our only guest.

288
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:36,982
We're all hosts here.

289
00:16:36,982 --> 00:16:38,541
We must treat you well.

290
00:16:39,421 --> 00:16:40,382
There is no need for that.

291
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:42,061
Sheng, just let us treat you.

292
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:43,862
We really don't dare make fun of him.

293
00:16:43,982 --> 00:16:45,222
Now that you're here,

294
00:16:45,342 --> 00:16:47,021
it's so much fun
that we can all tease him.

295
00:16:47,742 --> 00:16:48,982
You dare to joke about him?

296
00:16:49,102 --> 00:16:51,262
Aren't you afraid that he'll cut you up?

297
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:52,821
Stop saying that.

298
00:16:53,382 --> 00:16:55,781
It's getting late.
I should go back to school.

299
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:58,582
We can have dinner together next time.

300
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:01,021
We'll see you off.

301
00:17:01,582 --> 00:17:03,061
I'm on your way. I'll accompany you.

302
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:06,542
Then, we won't see you off.

303
00:17:06,661 --> 00:17:07,661
You won't stay for dinner?

304
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:13,221
- Take care.
- Let me carry it for you.

305
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:14,302
- No need.
- It's okay.

306
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:18,901
You guys wrap up. We'll go first.

307
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,142
- You are welcome. We are supposed to do it.
- You can leave it to us.

308
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:22,461
Just ignore us.

309
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,142
Okay, let's go.

310
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:25,461
Mao,

311
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:27,582
keep all the tracks for me.

312
00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:28,901
And pick up the vocals for me first.

313
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:32,542
Someone is missing you.

314
00:17:32,582 --> 00:17:34,302
- Goodbye.
- Thank you for your hard work.

315
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:35,302
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

316
00:17:35,302 --> 00:17:36,221
Take care.

317
00:17:38,062 --> 00:17:40,701
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

318
00:17:41,822 --> 00:17:43,382
You scared me.

319
00:17:53,981 --> 00:17:56,261
This backpack is pretty heavy.
I can carry it myself.

320
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:57,022
It's okay.

321
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:02,142
It's not very late yet.

322
00:18:02,862 --> 00:18:03,941
Is your school far from here?

323
00:18:04,782 --> 00:18:05,582
Not too far.

324
00:18:05,661 --> 00:18:08,342
If the bus comes on time,
it will take about 20 minutes.

325
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:09,741
That's good.

326
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,501
(It's really impolite to let him
carry my backpack when we first met.)

327
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:17,941
They were too noisy just now.

328
00:18:18,342 --> 00:18:19,421
If you're not in a hurry,

329
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:21,936
I'll accompany you to have a simple meal
before escorting you back.

330
00:18:23,862 --> 00:18:24,816
What would you like to eat?

331
00:18:28,622 --> 00:18:30,102
How about bamboo shoot soup?

332
00:18:32,261 --> 00:18:34,342
If you have no objection,
let's have bamboo shoot soup.

333
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:37,261
This season is just right for having it.

334
00:18:38,741 --> 00:18:39,062
Let's go.

335
00:18:48,622 --> 00:18:50,022
(Back Alley)
Take care. Come again!

336
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:51,261
Alright, goodbye.

337
00:18:53,356 --> 00:18:56,976
(Back Alley Private Cuisine)

338
00:18:59,661 --> 00:19:00,221
Welcome.

339
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:02,221
- This way, please.
- Okay.

340
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:05,342
Mr. Mo, you're quite early today.

341
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:06,102
Right.

342
00:19:08,062 --> 00:19:09,461
- Who will do the ordering?
- I will.

343
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:11,536
The bamboo shoot soup takes a while.
Let's start with that.

344
00:19:11,661 --> 00:19:13,501
Alright, take your time with the menu.

345
00:19:13,782 --> 00:19:15,261
I'll tell the chef
to start on that for you.

346
00:19:15,302 --> 00:19:16,221
Okay, thank you, Wang.

347
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:16,822
You're welcome.

348
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:19,152
Start with the bamboo shoot soup.

349
00:19:19,342 --> 00:19:20,181
Got it.

350
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:24,048
I'm not familiar with this place.
You should do the ordering.

351
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:26,421
Then I'll order for us.

352
00:19:28,142 --> 00:19:29,622
Let's have a few specialties.

353
00:19:32,181 --> 00:19:34,822
Three meat dishes and one vegetable dish.
And the bamboo shoot soup.

354
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:36,022
Isn't that too much?

355
00:19:36,022 --> 00:19:37,941
Two meat dishes and one vegetable dish
should be enough.

356
00:19:37,941 --> 00:19:40,464
If need be,
order an additional cold dish.

357
00:19:41,062 --> 00:19:41,661
Grilled gluten?

358
00:19:45,342 --> 00:19:47,582
Okay. Beverage or tea?

359
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:49,382
Tea.

360
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:50,701
What kind of tea?

361
00:19:50,862 --> 00:19:52,661
Chrysanthemum? Pu-erh?

362
00:19:53,822 --> 00:19:54,342
Either will do.

363
00:19:55,342 --> 00:19:56,102
Pu-erh.

364
00:19:57,461 --> 00:19:58,622
Okay. Wait a second.

365
00:20:03,062 --> 00:20:04,822
One of these...

366
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:13,022
Thank you.

367
00:20:15,701 --> 00:20:17,022
This place is like our dining hall.

368
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:18,461
When we're too busy,

369
00:20:18,622 --> 00:20:19,661
we simply notify the boss,

370
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:21,261
and the food will be delivered
to our door.

371
00:20:22,582 --> 00:20:24,382
I see you and the boss
are familiar with each other.

372
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:43,782
How does it taste? Is it to your liking?

373
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:47,022
The bamboo shoot soup here
is very tasty.

374
00:20:47,382 --> 00:20:48,582
I particularly enjoy it.

375
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:50,862
Me too.

376
00:20:51,142 --> 00:20:54,382
But usually, it's my parents
who cook it for me at home.

377
00:20:54,582 --> 00:20:55,582
I rarely eat out.

378
00:20:55,901 --> 00:20:57,181
My parents were very busy with work.

379
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:59,661
It's mostly just me cooking.

380
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:02,622
After graduation,
I started living with Juemei.

381
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:05,181
When we were too lazy to cook,
we went out to eat together.

382
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:08,102
Have you tried cooking it?

383
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:11,261
No.

384
00:21:11,622 --> 00:21:12,501
It's simple.

385
00:21:13,062 --> 00:21:15,142
Blanch chunks of fresh bamboo shoots
in hot water first.

386
00:21:15,302 --> 00:21:17,822
Then use cold water to soak salty meat
and dried bamboo shoots

387
00:21:17,941 --> 00:21:19,582
to remove the saltiness.

388
00:21:22,862 --> 00:21:23,382
Thank you.

389
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:27,981
Put the scallion and ginger
in the cold water.

390
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:30,701
After the water boils,
add the salty meat and ribs to it.

391
00:21:31,382 --> 00:21:33,382
But sometimes
I also like to add salty pig's feet.

392
00:21:34,981 --> 00:21:37,102
When the soup is turned
into such a milky white one,

393
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:40,062
turn to low heat
and cook for another hour.

394
00:21:41,382 --> 00:21:42,822
What about the tied tofu skin?

395
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:44,382
Don't rush.

396
00:21:44,944 --> 00:21:47,382
Finally, add the tied tofu skin
and simmer for a quarter of an hour

397
00:21:47,782 --> 00:21:49,102
before sprinkling some chopped chives.

398
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:50,261
Then it can be served.

399
00:21:56,142 --> 00:21:59,302
You seem to enjoy talking about recipes.

400
00:22:02,941 --> 00:22:04,102
Do you want to hear the truth?

401
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:06,501
Sure.

402
00:22:08,622 --> 00:22:12,382
Actually, I don't really know
what to say to you.

403
00:22:13,261 --> 00:22:15,822
But it seems
that you don't resist recipes.

404
00:22:18,261 --> 00:22:19,542
Of course not.

405
00:22:19,741 --> 00:22:21,022
I actually really enjoy them.

406
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:23,622
Every time you talk about recipes,
I take notes seriously,

407
00:22:23,782 --> 00:22:25,741
thinking there will be a chance
for me to try them out.

408
00:22:26,862 --> 00:22:27,382
Really?

409
00:22:28,382 --> 00:22:29,461
I'm glad I helped.

410
00:22:31,622 --> 00:22:32,142
Are you full?

411
00:22:33,261 --> 00:22:33,822
Yes.

412
00:22:35,261 --> 00:22:37,941
- Bill, please.
- Coming.

413
00:22:40,261 --> 00:22:42,461
Here. It's a total of 187 yuan.

414
00:22:43,582 --> 00:22:45,981
Is this your new employee?
She's so young.

415
00:22:46,941 --> 00:22:48,661
No. She's still a student.

416
00:22:49,941 --> 00:22:52,261
It's the first time you've come
with a girl. I'll give you a discount.

417
00:22:52,542 --> 00:22:54,421
That's 150 yuan.

418
00:22:56,302 --> 00:22:57,382
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

419
00:23:00,022 --> 00:23:01,221
- It's done.
- Okay.

420
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:03,102
Thank you.

421
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:03,741
You're welcome.

422
00:23:05,221 --> 00:23:05,941
Thank you.

423
00:23:07,102 --> 00:23:07,822
You're welcome.

424
00:23:08,981 --> 00:23:11,461
Well, let's go then.

425
00:23:11,981 --> 00:23:14,062
Your school is far away from here.

426
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:16,421
- We need to hurry.
- Okay.

427
00:23:21,862 --> 00:23:22,741
Let me carry that.

428
00:23:22,741 --> 00:23:23,782
- It's okay.
- It is too heavy.

429
00:23:23,782 --> 00:23:24,822
You can put on your scarf.

430
00:23:24,941 --> 00:23:26,782
Mo Qingcheng?

431
00:23:28,261 --> 00:23:28,901
Sheng.

432
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,501
Didn't you say you were going to
escort her back to school?

433
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,221
But it's been 40 or 50 minutes already,

434
00:23:34,221 --> 00:23:36,181
and you are still
around the recording studio.

435
00:23:36,302 --> 00:23:37,981
Stop talking, you silly.

436
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,382
The food here is pretty good, right?

437
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,622
You can come here often.

438
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:45,181
You guys had bamboo shoot soup?

439
00:23:45,302 --> 00:23:46,121
I thought we were friends.

440
00:23:46,121 --> 00:23:48,142
I've been talking about it for days
and you wouldn't come with me.

441
00:23:48,142 --> 00:23:49,941
He has Sheng now
and has no time for you.

442
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:51,062
How about I eat with you?

443
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:51,981
Okay, then it's settled.

444
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:53,461
Don't just stand there. Come and sit.

445
00:23:53,622 --> 00:23:55,062
- Coming.
- Here.

446
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:56,941
You two keep going.

447
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:58,342
Just pretend I weren't here.

448
00:24:00,421 --> 00:24:01,022
Then let's go.

449
00:24:03,102 --> 00:24:04,221
We're leaving. Enjoy your meal.

450
00:24:04,261 --> 00:24:05,421
Escort her back safely.

451
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:06,062
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

452
00:24:06,062 --> 00:24:06,741
Goodbye, Sheng.

453
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:07,421
See you, Sheng.

454
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:08,261
We're leaving, Wang.

455
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:09,302
Wang,

456
00:24:09,421 --> 00:24:10,221
we need to order now.

457
00:24:10,221 --> 00:24:10,901
I'm coming.

458
00:24:11,382 --> 00:24:12,382
We want bamboo shoot soup too.

459
00:24:12,382 --> 00:24:12,981
No problem.

460
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:14,382
I'll have them
start preparing yours first.

461
00:24:14,382 --> 00:24:15,440
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

462
00:24:16,862 --> 00:24:18,261
They're used to joking with me.

463
00:24:18,421 --> 00:24:19,542
Don't take it to heart.

464
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:20,822
It's fine.

465
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:23,501
They like to joke around online.

466
00:24:24,661 --> 00:24:25,461
Give me the backpack.

467
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:26,022
It's fine.

468
00:24:27,102 --> 00:24:28,261
Really, it's fine.

469
00:24:28,822 --> 00:24:30,822
This doesn't weigh much for me at all.

470
00:24:31,741 --> 00:24:33,221
I'm returning to school today.

471
00:24:33,382 --> 00:24:35,901
So I brought more things than usual,
making it heavier.

472
00:24:36,181 --> 00:24:38,302
I feel bad for having you carry it.

473
00:24:41,542 --> 00:24:43,661
It's getting dark.
I'll go back to school myself.

474
00:24:44,741 --> 00:24:45,741
It's because it's getting dark

475
00:24:45,862 --> 00:24:48,701
that I want to escort you back.
Let's go.

476
00:24:59,661 --> 00:25:00,421
My bus is here.

477
00:25:13,022 --> 00:25:13,862
Give me the backpack.

478
00:25:41,221 --> 00:25:42,981
It's from the hospital... Just a moment.

479
00:25:43,941 --> 00:25:45,542
I'm okay. Take your time.

480
00:25:58,382 --> 00:26:00,181
I thought

481
00:26:00,862 --> 00:26:03,221
you were good at dubbing
and didn't like singing.

482
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:05,102
Why is that?

483
00:26:06,862 --> 00:26:08,382
I rarely hear you sing.

484
00:26:08,622 --> 00:26:10,022
Your singing is so beautiful.

485
00:26:10,421 --> 00:26:13,142
Why don't you sing but only do dubbing?

486
00:26:14,261 --> 00:26:17,302
Singing takes more effort.

487
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:20,701
I feel dubbing is more tiring.

488
00:26:22,802 --> 00:26:24,742
Every profession
produces its own leading practitioner.

489
00:26:25,822 --> 00:26:29,022
It's better for us
to do what we are good at.

490
00:26:30,181 --> 00:26:34,102
- But your singing is really beautiful.
- Thanks.

491
00:26:38,822 --> 00:26:41,622
The path to our recording studio
has nice scenery.

492
00:26:44,862 --> 00:26:47,382
I'll take you for a walk
next time you come again.

When did you come back?

510
00:28:30,822 --> 00:28:31,701
This afternoon.

511
00:28:35,062 --> 00:28:35,862
Not bad.

512
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:38,461
You misunderstood.

513
00:28:38,941 --> 00:28:40,822
I did? So he is your brother?

514
00:28:42,342 --> 00:28:43,102
No.

515
00:28:43,302 --> 00:28:44,941
Then I didn't misunderstand.

516
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,102
I won't disturb you.

517
00:28:51,901 --> 00:28:53,941
I've arrived.

518
00:28:54,302 --> 00:28:54,941
Thank you.

519
00:28:55,661 --> 00:28:56,782
Okay. See you next time.

520
00:28:58,181 --> 00:28:58,901
See you.

521
00:28:59,862 --> 00:29:01,102
Go inside. I should go too.

522
00:29:02,261 --> 00:29:03,741
Have a safe journey.

523
00:29:10,622 --> 00:29:11,822
(It's so heavy.)

524
00:29:11,822 --> 00:29:13,582
(If I knew
he would carry it all the way,)

525
00:29:13,941 --> 00:29:15,461
(I definitely wouldn't bring
so many snacks.)

526
00:29:27,022 --> 00:29:29,181
What are you doing
standing there, Sheng?

527
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:35,661
Why are you doing here?

528
00:29:38,421 --> 00:29:39,382
How did you feel to see him?

529
00:29:39,421 --> 00:29:40,901
Were you nervous or excited?

530
00:29:43,622 --> 00:29:44,701
Yes, I was excited.

531
00:29:46,142 --> 00:29:47,741
Juemei told me on WeChat,

532
00:29:47,981 --> 00:29:50,062
saying Qiang Qingci personally
escorted you to school.

533
00:29:50,062 --> 00:29:51,382
Is he handsome?

534
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,461
He is not handsome?

535
00:29:56,022 --> 00:29:57,102
But it doesn't matter.

536
00:29:57,181 --> 00:29:58,622
Anyway, you don't judge by appearances.

537
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:02,102
Let me help you.

538
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:05,062
What's in it? It's so heavy.

539
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:08,421
Meat mooncakes, egg yolk pastry,

540
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:10,421
duck gizzards, duck necks, chips,

541
00:30:10,501 --> 00:30:12,741
deboned chicken feet, dried pork,

542
00:30:12,822 --> 00:30:15,261
and daily nuts.

543
00:30:17,461 --> 00:30:21,461
Does your mother fatten you up?

544
00:30:21,782 --> 00:30:22,782
No way.

545
00:30:22,941 --> 00:30:24,582
It's just that all four of my brothers

546
00:30:24,701 --> 00:30:25,981
each bought me some snacks.

547
00:30:25,981 --> 00:30:27,302
I couldn't choose, right?

548
00:30:27,302 --> 00:30:28,782
So I brought all the snacks. Let's go.

549
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:31,181
Is he handsome?

550
00:30:32,941 --> 00:30:34,542
He seems alright.

551
00:30:38,941 --> 00:30:39,701
Mo Qingcheng?

552
00:30:40,941 --> 00:30:41,622
Mr. Lin.

553
00:30:42,701 --> 00:30:43,661
It really is you.

554
00:30:43,661 --> 00:30:44,501
Long time no see.

555
00:30:44,981 --> 00:30:46,448
It's been years since you graduated.

556
00:30:46,822 --> 00:30:48,981
Good. You're looking more spirited.

557
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,941
You too. You are still charming.

558
00:30:51,941 --> 00:30:52,816
How's your health?

559
00:30:53,062 --> 00:30:53,822
I'm quite well.

560
00:30:54,022 --> 00:30:55,542
Do you know about the School of Media?

561
00:30:55,822 --> 00:30:56,822
The School of Media?

562
00:30:57,342 --> 00:30:59,901
I do. It's a newly established school.

563
00:31:00,142 --> 00:31:01,941
It used to belong
to the School of Literature.

564
00:31:02,142 --> 00:31:03,542
It has been formed for only a few years.

565
00:31:04,022 --> 00:31:04,701
No wonder

566
00:31:05,102 --> 00:31:07,302
I don't recall hearing about it
when I was studying.

567
00:31:07,302 --> 00:31:08,062
That's right.

568
00:31:08,822 --> 00:31:10,901
Why do you want to know
about the School of Media?

569
00:31:12,181 --> 00:31:14,622
I happen to have a junior there.

570
00:31:15,822 --> 00:31:16,501
A junior.

571
00:31:17,582 --> 00:31:18,822
Mr. Lin, please excuse me.

572
00:31:18,981 --> 00:31:19,622
I'll head back now.

573
00:31:19,941 --> 00:31:22,461
Okay, take care.
Come by when you have time.

574
00:31:22,782 --> 00:31:23,302
Stay in touch.

575
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:24,501
Alright. Goodbye.

576
00:31:24,501 --> 00:31:25,062
Take care.

577
00:31:25,421 --> 00:31:26,102
Thank you.

578
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:26,782
Goodbye.

579
00:31:27,741 --> 00:31:29,421
Juemei is tall

580
00:31:29,582 --> 00:31:31,461
and quite imposing
when he is not joking.

581
00:31:32,022 --> 00:31:33,392
He's more imposing than in the videos.

582
00:31:34,261 --> 00:31:36,701
Why don't you join me
at an event next time?

583
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:38,221
Something is going on between you.

584
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:39,822
No, there isn't.

585
00:31:39,862 --> 00:31:40,901
Don't talk nonsense.

586
00:31:41,022 --> 00:31:42,022
Are you sure?

587
00:31:42,022 --> 00:31:44,661
He even let you
eavesdrop on an internal event.

588
00:31:44,661 --> 00:31:45,941
That was because...

589
00:31:46,461 --> 00:31:47,741
What are you up there for?

590
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:48,542
I'm tidying up the bed.

591
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:53,901
Anyway, I feel
that Qiang Qingci has feelings for you.

592
00:31:54,302 --> 00:31:56,622
He even escorted you back to school.

593
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:01,501
He did it out of politeness.

594
00:32:03,661 --> 00:32:04,261
Politeness?

595
00:32:04,782 --> 00:32:07,062
So he took a bus for more than 20 stops,

596
00:32:07,062 --> 00:32:09,941
which covered almost an entire bus line,
out of pure politeness?

597
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:12,582
That was really an unprecedented level
of politeness.

598
00:32:12,582 --> 00:32:14,221
I'll have to go to the music club later.

599
00:32:16,062 --> 00:32:18,261
Just take your time to think it over
if he is interested in you.

600
00:32:18,261 --> 00:32:18,941
I'm late.

601
00:32:18,941 --> 00:32:20,302
And if you two actually get together...

602
00:32:23,622 --> 00:32:26,142
It's more like
something is going on between you two.

603
00:32:28,501 --> 00:32:30,142
You sent her back to school, and then?

604
00:32:30,822 --> 00:32:31,701
That's the end?

605
00:32:32,221 --> 00:32:32,741
Yes.

606
00:32:35,382 --> 00:32:36,142
Look at him.

607
00:32:54,661 --> 00:32:56,582
Why would you snoop
on someone else's phone?

608
00:32:57,261 --> 00:32:58,022
What a bad habit.

609
00:32:58,421 --> 00:33:00,661
It seems like
you haven't connected to the Wi-Fi.

610
00:33:06,582 --> 00:33:09,701
You have to strike
while the iron is hot.

611
00:33:10,062 --> 00:33:10,822
That's right.

612
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,822
You are a doctor, after all.

613
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:14,022
You have to live your day
as if it were 36 hours.

614
00:33:14,102 --> 00:33:15,582
You better use the new year's holiday

615
00:33:15,701 --> 00:33:16,782
and pursue the girl

616
00:33:16,901 --> 00:33:18,542
until you make her happy
with one fell swoop.

617
00:33:18,661 --> 00:33:21,022
Then, next year, you can bring her home
as your girlfriend.

618
00:33:21,102 --> 00:33:22,782
Right. And the year after that,
you propose to her.

619
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:24,342
You're rushing things.

620
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:25,221
I'm not.

621
00:33:30,536 --> 00:33:32,848
♪It's hard to convey the lovesickness♪

622
00:33:32,848 --> 00:33:36,468
♪Over millions of miles♪

623
00:33:37,261 --> 00:33:37,862
You're back.

624
00:33:40,302 --> 00:33:43,022
I want to listen to the song
I recorded this afternoon.

625
00:33:45,342 --> 00:33:46,102
It's not done yet.

626
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:48,142
I just selected the vocals
and haven't done the mixdown.

627
00:33:49,302 --> 00:33:50,582
I'm not feeling very well lately.

628
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:51,981
I really don't have the energy.

629
00:33:52,062 --> 00:33:52,862
Wait a little longer.

630
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:55,022
You should take some medicine.

631
00:33:55,622 --> 00:33:56,382
I can do it myself.

632
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:57,542
You'll do it yourself?

633
00:33:58,062 --> 00:34:00,302
I haven't seen you
personally work on anything for years.

634
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:03,261
You are sick, and it's the new year.

635
00:34:03,382 --> 00:34:04,661
I should let you get some rest.

636
00:34:04,862 --> 00:34:05,582
Are you sure?

637
00:34:07,582 --> 00:34:09,462
- Then I'll leave it to you.
- No problem.

638
00:34:10,221 --> 00:34:10,861
Dress warmly.

639
00:34:11,261 --> 00:34:11,982
Okay.

640
00:34:15,912 --> 00:34:19,472
♪Grinding the memories into ink♪

641
00:34:19,472 --> 00:34:21,936

He is taking medicine.

644
00:34:26,781 --> 00:34:27,942
What's wrong, Mao?

645
00:34:28,102 --> 00:34:28,741
Are you okay?

646
00:34:29,341 --> 00:34:31,142
I got a cold.

647
00:34:32,622 --> 00:34:33,622
You should rest more.

648
00:34:34,142 --> 00:34:35,181
Rest? Sure.

649
00:34:35,422 --> 00:34:36,582
There are clothes at my place.

650
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,902
Put them on later.

651
00:34:39,902 --> 00:34:40,422
By the way,

652
00:34:41,982 --> 00:34:43,102
what happened today?

653
00:34:43,261 --> 00:34:44,661
Why is he
doing post-production himself?

654
00:34:48,661 --> 00:34:52,462
Mao, don't you think
that Qiang Qingci was especially kind

655
00:34:52,582 --> 00:34:53,582
to Shengshengman,

656
00:34:53,982 --> 00:34:57,861
who came for the recording today?

657
00:34:58,582 --> 00:34:59,701
Yes, you are right.

658
00:35:01,502 --> 00:35:03,741
Didn't you say
it was their second meeting today?

659
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:08,221
What if they fell in love
at first sight?

660
00:35:08,741 --> 00:35:09,821
It doesn't seem like it.

661
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:12,102
Isn't Qiang Qingci a slow starter?

662
00:35:13,462 --> 00:35:16,102
In the beginning, we all thought so.

663
00:35:21,701 --> 00:35:23,781
Qiang Qingci is really unfathomable.

664
00:35:26,102 --> 00:35:27,902
Pretending to be profound.

665
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:29,142
Let's drink.

666
00:36:06,388 --> 00:36:08,144
(Mixdown for Return with You)

667
00:36:10,388 --> 00:36:12,240
(Mixdown)

668
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:17,968
(Chat history with Shengshengman)

669
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:25,942
(Should I ask if he has arrived?)

670
00:36:26,301 --> 00:36:27,261
(Maybe not?)

671
00:36:28,301 --> 00:36:32,062
(Is it a bit strange to ask
if we're not very familiar?)

672
00:36:34,462 --> 00:36:35,181
Gu Sheng.

673
00:36:36,582 --> 00:36:37,781
Goodness!

674
00:36:39,422 --> 00:36:41,582
If they fell over, I would have to
help you for a while.

675
00:36:42,261 --> 00:36:43,341
Why are you here?

676
00:36:44,261 --> 00:36:45,341
To pick you up.

677
00:36:45,462 --> 00:36:47,422
The club leader asked me
to fetch you on my way back.

678
00:36:47,542 --> 00:36:49,741
Otherwise,
it would be a long walk for you.

679
00:36:49,781 --> 00:36:50,960
And it's not worth taking a taxi.

680
00:36:51,381 --> 00:36:52,821
You got a new bike?

681
00:36:53,661 --> 00:36:55,821
The old one was always
running out of power halfway.

682
00:36:55,942 --> 00:36:57,502
So I gritted my teeth and got a new one.

683
00:36:57,661 --> 00:36:59,462
I heard it can be used for ten years.

684
00:36:59,462 --> 00:37:00,022
Really?

685
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:04,982
What are you looking at?

686
00:37:05,062 --> 00:37:06,542
You are blushing.

687
00:37:07,181 --> 00:37:07,781
Am I?

688
00:37:08,102 --> 00:37:10,781
Who are you thinking of?
You are smiling so radiantly.

689
00:37:11,102 --> 00:37:13,542
- Not at all. It's hot.
- If you say so.

690
00:37:14,301 --> 00:37:14,741
Done.

691
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:18,741
Get on.

692
00:37:21,381 --> 00:37:21,902
Let's go.

693
00:37:22,301 --> 00:37:23,422
Hold tight. Off we go.

694
00:37:30,341 --> 00:37:31,221
Thank you, everyone.

695
00:37:31,341 --> 00:37:32,542
Let's take a quick break.

696
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:34,181
I'll sing with you later.

697
00:37:35,741 --> 00:37:36,341
We are back.

698
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:38,341
Thank goodness
someone is replacing me now.

699
00:37:38,502 --> 00:37:39,821
My throat is going to hurt.

700
00:37:41,582 --> 00:37:42,422
Hello, everyone.

701
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:44,102
Next, our club's Shengshengman

702
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:45,542
will continue to sing with you.

703
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:47,781
Just wait a moment. Here.

704
00:37:47,942 --> 00:37:50,462
Where is Off Key?
Isn't he supposed to be here too?

705
00:37:51,462 --> 00:37:52,381
He went on a date.

706
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:56,422
He said it took him 20 years
to be confessed to for the first time,

707
00:37:56,422 --> 00:37:58,622
and he had to go to that date.

708
00:37:58,622 --> 00:37:59,701
Then we should bless him.

709
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:01,982
Don't push yourself too hard.

710
00:38:01,982 --> 00:38:03,781
It should be about time
after you sing two more songs.

711
00:38:03,902 --> 00:38:05,221
I'm going to log into my own account.

712
00:38:05,462 --> 00:38:06,672
I'll get you something to drink.

713
00:38:13,261 --> 00:38:15,301
Hello, everyone. I am Shengshengman.

714
00:38:18,781 --> 00:38:19,422
(I'm home now.)

715
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:26,341
Sorry, I have to make a call first.

716
00:38:32,301 --> 00:38:35,462
(That's great. Thank you
for escorting me back to school today.)

717
00:38:37,701 --> 00:38:40,341
(How come we suddenly seem so familiar?)

718
00:38:41,062 --> 00:38:42,502
(He even told me about his whereabouts.)

719
00:38:47,622 --> 00:38:49,462
(I'm on the air. Let's talk later.)

(Shengshengman)

722
00:39:07,942 --> 00:39:10,622
Today, let's start
with the song Green Plums,

723
00:39:10,741 --> 00:39:13,902
because I just heard someone singing it.

724
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:18,864

Are my eyes tricking me?

748

The online audience
exceeded ten thousand.

749
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,792
(Online members: 12007)

750
00:41:25,686 --> 00:41:26,261
(Qiang Qingci)

751
00:41:26,261 --> 00:41:28,942
Look. Isn't that Qiang Qingci?

752
00:41:29,502 --> 00:41:30,861
(Qiang Qingci)
Yes, it's him.

753
00:41:31,062 --> 00:41:32,661
It's really Qiang Qingci.

754
00:41:32,661 --> 00:41:34,381
Qiang Qingci has come
to our live broadcast.

755
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:36,976
(Qiang Qingci)

756
00:41:38,022 --> 00:41:38,861
Isn't that right?

757
00:41:38,982 --> 00:41:39,982
Welcome.

758
00:41:40,102 --> 00:41:42,701
For our small club,
having a guest such as yourself

759
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:43,861
is a great honor.

760
00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:47,221
I wonder if we could invite you
to our next singing event.

761
00:41:47,221 --> 00:41:48,240
What are you talking about?

762
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:53,902
(If I'm not too busy with work,
I should be able to come.)

763
00:41:56,102 --> 00:41:57,622
That's my idol!

764
00:41:57,942 --> 00:41:59,221
Show some restraint.

765
00:41:59,381 --> 00:42:00,982
Sheng, say something.

766
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:03,102
He is here as a guest.
We need to be hospitable.

767
00:42:03,381 --> 00:42:04,462
Reply to him.

768
00:42:05,381 --> 00:42:05,982
What should...

769
00:42:07,022 --> 00:42:09,142
I don't know how to play host.

770
00:42:09,142 --> 00:42:12,464
(Shengshengman)
(Interaction)

771
00:42:16,781 --> 00:42:17,781
- You two met in person?
- They did?

772
00:42:21,181 --> 00:42:23,142
But it wasn't just any meeting.

773
00:42:23,221 --> 00:42:25,142
It was for recording a song.

774
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:28,142
- You two actually met in person?
- Right.

775
00:42:29,102 --> 00:42:30,861
But there were so many other people
at the scene.

776
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:33,221
They were all
from the Perfect Voice Studio?

777
00:42:35,462 --> 00:42:37,902
Have you heard?
Isn't she just too lucky?

778
00:42:37,942 --> 00:42:39,982
Talk about that later.
Let Sheng greet our esteemed guest now.

779
00:42:40,102 --> 00:42:42,422
He is a rare guest.
We should entertain him properly.

780
00:42:43,462 --> 00:42:44,422
Entertain... Entertain...

781
00:42:44,741 --> 00:42:46,022
Sheng, the private message.

782
00:42:46,781 --> 00:42:47,542
The private message.

783
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:50,422
Please give them some privacy.

784
00:42:50,422 --> 00:42:52,022
No wonder you can't find a girlfriend.

785
00:42:52,261 --> 00:42:53,221
Look quickly, Sheng.

786
00:42:53,381 --> 00:42:55,022
Qiang Qingci is looking for you
for something.

787
00:42:55,142 --> 00:42:57,181
If he suddenly contacts you,
it must be something important.

788
00:42:58,221 --> 00:42:59,462
It might not be him.

789
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:01,142
Why don't you take a look?

790
00:43:01,741 --> 00:43:02,582
Let's go!

791
00:43:02,582 --> 00:43:03,341
What's wrong?

792
00:43:03,341 --> 00:43:04,781
We'll wait outside for you.

793
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:13,381
(My phone is running out of power.
I just wanted to say hi to you.)

794
00:43:16,102 --> 00:43:16,582
(Okay.)

795
00:43:40,462 --> 00:43:41,261
It's all set?

796
00:43:41,422 --> 00:43:42,861
Listen and see if there are any issues.

797
00:43:43,022 --> 00:43:44,272
If there are problems, let me know.

798
00:43:50,741 --> 00:43:52,142
About that girl today,

799
00:43:53,181 --> 00:43:55,701
I heard you were quite special to her.

800
00:44:01,142 --> 00:44:02,062
Have you taken medicine?

801
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,142
Of course.

802
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,142
It's rare to find a girl you fall for.

803
00:44:06,261 --> 00:44:07,622
You have to put in extra effort.

804
00:44:08,261 --> 00:44:10,341
But you need to control
the degree and timing well.

805
00:44:10,861 --> 00:44:11,861
Don't be too forceful.

806
00:44:12,502 --> 00:44:13,462
Did you hear me?

807
00:44:17,582 --> 00:44:18,181
Let me hear.

808
00:44:27,502 --> 00:44:30,422
