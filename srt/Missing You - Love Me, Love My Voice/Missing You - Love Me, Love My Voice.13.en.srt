Mom.

27
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,840
It's the weekend.
Aren't you going to sleep more?

28
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,659
I'll help out at the supermarket
for you on this weekend.

29
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,340
Help out at the supermarket for me?

30
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:06,779
Is there really nothing else?

31
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,539
No.

32
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:13,420
- Here, eat your dad's food first.
- Okay.

33
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,779
Let's go home.

34
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,759
- You got up, Sheng.
- Dad.

35
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:26,299
Honey, I just got a call from my mom.
She wants me to go to her place.

36
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:28,219
Why don't you
go to the supermarket first?

37
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:33,539
- Sheng said she'll go.
- She is going?

38
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:41,979
What's going on, Sheng? This is so rare.

39
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,780
I want to help out at the supermarket,
as I'm free today. Isn't that alright?

40
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:55,499
It's alright. It's just that
this is very unusual, which worries me.

41
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:01,760
- If it bothers you, just go yourself.
- See? I knew you didn't mean it.

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,260
Alright, enough with the squabbling.
Wash your hands and pack the lunch.

43
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,040
- Okay.
- Sheng, you can eat first.

44
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,219
It's time to pack the lunch, Peanut.

45
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,072
Slow down.

(Wangjia Supermarket)

47
00:03:34,499 --> 00:03:35,099
Brother!

48
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,959
- Aren't you going to buy some figures?
- I was planning to get them after work.

49
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,840
Why don't you go now? It should be
less packed after lunchtime.

50
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,819
Are you sure? Then I'm off.

51
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,580
- Stay here. I'll be back soon.
- Okay, see you later.

52
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:12,779
- You actually came.
- You told me to come. How could I not?

53
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,099
What do you want to eat?

54
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:22,039
I just performed surgery. The cafeteria
is closed, and I don't want takeout.

55
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:25,100
Let's see what boxed lunches you have.

56
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,220
Which do you want? Kung Pao Chicken
or Pork with Preserved Vegetable?

57
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:31,180
I'll take one of each.
Feng Yasong didn't eat either.

58
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:33,780
Alright.

59
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,060
- You often help out here on weekends?
- Sometimes.

60
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,620
Give me those. I'll get you a bag.

61
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,139
- Should I heat them for you?
- We got a microwave in the hospital.

62
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,860
You don't have to pay. It's on me.

63
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:04,980
But this is your parents' supermarket.
It'll be awkward next time I meet them.

64
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:11,180
Welcome!

65
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,339
- Why were you up so late last night?
- Later than when you texted me.

66
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:20,339
Why?

67
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,180
I couldn't sleep.

68
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,120
- Are you not feeling well again?
- Not that.

69
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,819
Really?

70
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,579
I'm a doctor. Trust me.

71
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,580
- After you.
- Thank you.

72
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,699
Give them to me.

73
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,070
Have a nice day.

74
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,819
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

75
00:05:57,939 --> 00:05:58,540
These are on me.

76
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,220
- But it's my family's supermarket.
- I'll pay for them.

77
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:04,939
Alright.

78
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,740
I'll have more patients and an extra
surgery. I may stay till after 10 PM.

79
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:15,019
I may not come here for dinner.

80
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,660
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

82

Dr. Mo.

83
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:20,860
INR is low. What is the dose
of warfarin you have taken recently?

84
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,300
Once a day, and half a tablet each time.

85
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,900
Make that one tablet each time.
Come back for a recheck in three days.

86
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,620
- Okay. Thank you, Dr. Mo.
- You're welcome.

(Patient No. 3, Wang Linbo,
please go to Room 4.)

88
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:02,660
Brother, I have something to attend to.
I'll go first.

89
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,340
You are leaving?

90
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,299
Sheng, are you leaving? I'm free.
How about I treat you to a movie?

91
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:10,820
I'm busy.

92
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:15,039
I'll go with you in 10 minutes. Mom is
at Grandpa's. I need to pick her up.

93
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,120
- I'm really busy. Bye.
- Then, maybe next time.

94
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,379
- Bye.
- Bye.

95
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,060
Why doesn't she
even want me to go with her?

96
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,099
- What? I'm not working today.
- Then why are you here?

97
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,640
I love everything about my work.
Can't I just come here to eat and drink?

98
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,420
Fine. Suit yourself.

99
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,000
- Why are you leaving?
- Unlike you, I'm at work now.

100
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,260
- I am paid, so I need to work.
- Can't you chat with me for a while?

101
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,660
Even cafes do not have such a service.
What do you expect from a supermarket?

102
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:14,980
You might attract customers this way.
This place might become an attraction.

103
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,619
Alright.

104
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,939
What's wrong? What happened? Tell me.

105
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:39,780
I applied for a job
at a recording studio but didn't get it.

106
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:43,420
So you tried to change your career,
but you failed.

107
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:51,140
- I can only say that you had it coming.
- Can you stop being so mean?

108
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,440
I'm just kidding.
Don't take it to heart.

109
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,440
Just quit messing around all the time.
Look at you. All you do is slacking.

110
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,420
I can't believe you.

111
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:08,699
Make sure you're not late for work
on Monday.

112
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:13,219
I'm not like you, the owner's relative.
You've never been punctual.

113
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:18,740
Dong Yiru,
are you picking a fight with me?

114
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,579
Yes, that's my intention.

115
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,979
- Fine. I will let you win this.
- Thank you.

(Nursing Station)

117
00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:52,219
Excuse me, who are you looking for?

118
00:10:55,339 --> 00:11:02,520
I'm the delivery person. Can you
give this to Mo Qingcheng for me?

119
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,979
You're the delivery person?

120
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:07,300
Yes, I am.

121
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,979
Dr. Mo is performing the operation
and can't give you the delivery code.

122
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:18,479
- That's okay. I'll ask the sender.
- Okay.

123
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:24,459
- Please give this to him in person.
- I see. Don't worry.

124
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:27,560
- Have a great weekend.
- You too.

125
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,219
Thank you.

126
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:51,099
(My grandpa's cold noodles are the best.
Eat them as your dinner. From Sheng.)

127
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:43,140
Grandpa.

128
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:48,420
Is there something happy
you want to share with me?

129
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,579
Grandpa,

130
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,579
could you teach me
how to make cold noodles someday?

131
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:04,600
No problem. The most important thing
is the sauce. And my sauce is the best.

132
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,880
Grandpa, you're making me hungry.
Why don't you teach now?

133
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,939
- Sure, I've been craving this.
- Let's go.

134
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,739
I'll teach you how to make cold noodles.

135
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:33,260
You act like you're in a secret romance,
even in your own supermarket.

136
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,899
You don't know how much trouble
it'll be if my brothers find out.

137
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:38,979
I suppose.

138
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,900
Her brothers
are all overly protective of her.

139
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,020
Is the Perfect Voice Studio quite big?

140
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:53,080
- Yes. There are several rooms.
- Really?

141
00:13:53,080 --> 00:14:02,420
Who do you often see when you go there?
Do they all work there or individually?

142
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:12,460
I don't always see them all.
The leader, Juemei, has his own company.

143
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:17,520
Vice leader Doudou works full-time.
As for Qiang Qingci and Feng Yasong,

144
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,620
both of them are doctors
and are usually extremely busy.

145
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,900
They only dub when they have time off.
So it's not certain if I'll see them.

146
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:30,180
So, as someone's official girlfriend,
you can give us a tour, right?

147
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,739
Let's talk about it
after we date for a little longer.

148
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,819
I need to leave for an elective course.

149
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:47,152
- You've become shy.
- Not at all.

150
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:47,939
Go on then.

151
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:49,819
Bye.

152
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:56,540
- Wait. I have an elective course too.
- So you're leaving me alone here.

153
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:15,601
(Jueme...)

154
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:18,518
(Jueme...)

155
00:15:40,979 --> 00:15:44,619
- Doudou, when will the newcomer arrive?
- Tomorrow.

156
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:49,839
Tomorrow? I happen to have a game
that needs new character voices.

157
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,900
- Will he be here tomorrow morning?
- Yes, I told him to come at 9 AM.

158
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,819
- Well, I...
- Mao...

159
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:01,819
Where is Mao?

160
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:11,260
If a girl likes a boy, will she
take the initiative to contact him?

161
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,619
Like sending him a WeChat message
or something.

162
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:23,579
It depends. For me, I definitely will,
but some girls are too shy to act.

163
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:27,339
Why is that?

164
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:34,060
They don't want to be found out
or be bothersome when it is not mutual.

165
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:41,744
It's an avoidant attachment personality.
The more they like, the more they avoid.

166
00:16:45,008 --> 00:16:46,500
The more they like, the more they avoid?

167
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:51,459
Alright, I see.

168
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,540
So, who have you fallen for?

169
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,740
There is no one. It's just
I've been dubbing a TV drama lately.

170
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,899
There's a character setting in there
that I don't think feels right.

171
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:11,499
The character setting is a problem
for the crew instead of us.

172
00:17:11,499 --> 00:17:15,300
Aren't you going to dub just because
you think the drama is not right?

173
00:17:17,139 --> 00:17:23,700
Right. It's our job.
I'm just needlessly worrying.

174
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,940
- Alright, I got it.
- Okay.

175
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,619
- Thank you. I'm leaving you alone.
- No problem.

176
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:34,579
Let's see how long you can hold it.

177
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:42,619
- Take a look. What do you say?
- Let me see.

178
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:46,419
I look awesome. Indeed,
clothes make the man. Thank you.

179
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,399
I feel like a mother preparing clothes
for her daughter who is a new bride.

180
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:56,440
- I feel the same way.
- Stop teasing me.

181
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,980
I'm happy for you. Do your best
at Perfect Voice, and don't let us down.

182
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,120
Sure. I will definitely
learn from my idol, Feng Yasong,

183
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,760
and be an excellent modern slash youth.

184
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,300
When I have learned everything,
I will come back to help our club.

185
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,739
- But I'm scared to meet one person.
- Who?

186
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:24,560
- Qiang Qingci?
- Yeah.

187
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,640
Qiang Qingci is so high-profile
in chasing Sheng online.

188
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,940
While Sheng's boyfriend is excellent,
and he even treated us to a meal.

189
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,899
Knowing that I'm Sheng's friend,
Qiang Qingci will ask. What should I do?

190
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:46,400
Sheng is good and worthy of good people.
Also, it's her own business.

191
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,540
As long as Sheng is happy,
she can choose whoever she wants.

192
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,899
As for you, you're going to work here.
Just listen, observe, and learn more.

193
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,579
Tomorrow, I will send you
to Perfect Voice to encourage you.

194
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:02,980
Thank you, guys.

195
00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:10,060
We've arrived. It's right here.

196
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:15,220
The entire third floor
is the Perfect Voice's.

197
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:22,040
That's big. If only we could
reach such a scale one day.

198
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,099
We'll take it step by step.
A great building rises from the ground.

199
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,940
I finally found a decent job
that I genuinely like.

200
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,729
When are you planning to tell Sheng?
The leader and I have known it.

201
00:19:34,729 --> 00:19:38,340
- It will upset her if you keep quiet.
- I'll tell her today.

202
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,060
I will tell her as soon as I go upstairs
and sign the contract.

203
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:46,899
Without taking the final step,
I feel uneasy and dare not tell her.

204
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,220
Tell her as you eat dinner at the club.
I'm sure she'll be happy for you.

205
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,500
- Okay.
- Go up.

206
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,240
- Can you be gentler?
- My hands are strong. Bear with it.

207
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,920
Call me before you get off work.
If I have time, I'll pick you up.

208
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,479
I hate to bother you. Charging this bike
must be quite troublesome, right?

209
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:09,360
It's a new bike with good endurance.
Just remember to call me.

210
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,300
Alright, then I won't
stand on ceremony with you.

211
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,579
- I'm leaving now.
- I bid you farewell.

212
00:20:28,339 --> 00:20:30,879
- You're here. Come on in.
- Hello.

213
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:34,619
- Xiyou, Off Key is here.
- Okay.

214
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,400
- Reporting for duty?
- Yes.

215
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,640
Today is also my first day
as a full-time employee.

216
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,060
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

217
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,130
- Here.
- These are the internship contract

218
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,519
and the form required by HR.
Go over there and fill them out.

219
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,179
Thank you.

220
00:20:57,139 --> 00:20:59,120
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

221
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,499
- We are the only two new interns.
- Really?

222
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:04,260
- Let's eat lunch together to celebrate.
- That sounds good.

223
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,780
- Mr. Juemei.
- Mr. Juemei.

224
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,820
I need to record a demo urgently.
Drop what you're doing and come here.

225
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,500
- Okay.
- Come on.

226
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:33,619
Come in.

227
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,899
By the way, Mr. Mo just came back
and is taking a nap.

228
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:45,139
- No, he is awake. I will call him.
- Okay, thanks.

229
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,980
- Should I make you some tea or coffee?
- No need. You can go back to work.

230
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,480
It's okay. This is part of my work.
How about some milk tea instead?

231
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,680
- Thank you. I'd like to wash my hands.
- Turn right over there.

232
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,419
Okay.

233
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,940
- Let's go to our main recording room.
- Okay.

234
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,540
This way.

235
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:16,060
Good timing. Let me introduce them.
This is your fan, Off Key.

236
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:20,020
- Aren't you...
- What?

237
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:28,379
- The senior?
- Hello, my name is Qiang Qingci.

238
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,099
- You took away his attention instantly.
- I also find it strange.

239
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:53,019
- I met him once.
- Yes, we met once.

240
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:54,179
Off Key?

241
00:22:56,619 --> 00:22:59,260
I didn't know you guys...

242
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,740
It's pretty good.

243
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:09,379
This is Off Key, a very good friend
of mine from the club.

244
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:13,780
How come you are here?

245
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:20,540
- Didn't you tell Sheng?
- I am an official employee here now.

246
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,619
Really?

247
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,479
Why didn't you tell me?

248
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:30,119
I planned to tell you at the club
tonight after signing the contract.

249
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:34,480
Are you afraid I will stand you up?
I personally made the phone call.

250
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,580
No. It's simply too surprising
and doesn't seem realistic.

251
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,140
- Hello, idol.
- Finally, it's my turn.

252
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:46,879
I was too shocked just now. I didn't
expect Qiang Qingci to look like this.

253
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:51,080
What do you mean?
Was his look disappointing for you?

254
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,060
No, not at all.

255
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:58,660
Alright, let's talk over lunch.
I need them to finish a task first.

256
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,060
- Let's go.
- I'll go too.

257
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,520
Why didn't you tell me?

258
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,780
It's better for him to tell you
the good news in person.

259
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,280
- He is reliable. Trust me.
- I do.

260
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,020
Sheng is here today. I wonder if we can
have the lunch made by Mr. Mo.

261
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:23,599
- Yeah, that's right.
- That won't be a problem.

262
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:24,379
Really?

263
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:27,980
Let's cook.

264
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:34,643
(Awards won by the Perfect Voice Studio)

265
00:24:34,943 --> 00:24:36,819
(Perfect Voice Studio)

266
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:41,819
Today, two new members have joined us.
Let's welcome them.

267
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:45,000
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

268
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,192
I want to say something.

269
00:24:47,376 --> 00:24:54,120
I've been a fan of Perfect Voice
for ten years. My dream came true.

270
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,760
I want to say something too. Unlike Mei,
I didn't study broadcasting and hosting.

271
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,639
I am purely self-taught.
I'll drink to that.

272
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:05,379
- Me too.
- No more drinking.

273
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:08,000
- No need to be too polite.
- Don't be courteous.

274
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,600
Perfect Voice was once a community,
with half of its members being amateurs.

275
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,139
As for the Top Three, Feng Yasong
and Qiang Qingci are both doctors.

276
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:22,460
The rest is not important.
Anyway, not all of us are professionals.

277
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,820
Later, when we had the recording studio,
more and more professionals joined.

278
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,019
- Right.
- That's right.

279
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:31,850
Don't belittle yourself or use it
as an excuse to slack off. Do your best.

280
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:34,200
- I'll definitely do my best.
- Keep it up.

281
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,220
- Come on.
- Cheers.

282
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,659
- Let's drink.
- Cheers.

283
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:38,859
Welcome, guys.

284
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,540
- What are you still cooking?
- Chicken gizzards, soybeans and pickle.

285
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,920
- How's the lunch outside?
- Pretty good. Everyone enjoys the food.

286
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,712
I feel everyone quite likes Off Key.

287
00:26:06,768 --> 00:26:08,940
- Yes, Feng Yasong in particular.
- Really?

288
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,379
That's good.

289
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:14,500
Help me cook, okay?

290
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,300
- It smells so good.
- Right?

291
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,139
After stir-frying to smell good,
add the chicken gizzards,

292
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,220
oyster sauce,

293
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,899
and the pickle.

294
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,300
Just looking at this makes me hungry.

295
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:46,700
Green soybeans.

296
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:49,899
And, finally, sugar.

297
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:54,980
Okay.

298
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:03,379
- Get that lunch box for some rice.
- Okay.

299
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,579
Are you taking it
to eat at the hospital?

300
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,020
It's dinner for Off Key, so he
can save some money on a meal.

301
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,500
It tastes really good.

302
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,659
Yeah, it tastes really good.

303
00:27:52,899 --> 00:27:57,780
- We are just waiting for this dish.
- It's ready, and there's one more soup.

304
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:01,019
Okay, I won't disturb you then.

305
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:05,160
There's no room for us to sit.
We won't go out then.

306
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,260
Understood.
I'll close the door for you two.

307
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:16,999
- The new dish is here.
- Great.

308
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:18,399
Put it here.

309
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,000
- The soup is coming soon. Just wait.
- Okay.

310
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,359
- Off Key, go sit by Feng Yasong.
- This is delicious.

311
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:26,819
- Can I?
- Yes, go ahead. Take my seat.

312
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,339
- It's a bit spicy.
- It's not.

313
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,619
- Just a bit.
- Mr. Feng.

314
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,499
You don't need to be so polite with me.

315
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:42,700
I entered the industry 10 years earlier.
There's no difference between us. Eat.

316
00:28:43,899 --> 00:28:44,460
Thank you.

317
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:50,080
- How is the onboarding going?
- I just finished filling in everything.

318
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,859
That's good.

319
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:54,220
We get paid at the end of each month.
Do you have any savings?

320
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,519
- Will you be all right this month?
- No problem.

321
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:57,980
- Tell me if you have any problems.
- Okay.

322
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:04,580
I went through what you went through.
We're comrades with a decade between us.

323
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,720
I know. In one interview, you mentioned
that your favorite food is buns.

324
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,139
You could only have one meal a day
when you were poor, which was buns.

325
00:29:13,139 --> 00:29:16,440
- You know that old interview?
- Buns are nothing.

326
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:22,340
Back then, I got food poisoning
from eating seafood at a birthday party.

327
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,272
I was laid up, throwing up.

328
00:29:24,976 --> 00:29:30,300
I asked my roommate to get some medicine
and share it with me.

329
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:35,220
- That's miserable.
- If only you had known Feishao earlier.

330
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,864
- Then you could have enough medicine.
- Enough medicine?

331
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,979
- Weren't you a medical student before?
- That was back in high school.

332
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:50,379
Even though my first seafood experience
was a bit painful, it was delicious.

333
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:54,139
- Yeah, it was.
- The first experience is the best.

334
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,740
Try this.

335
00:29:58,099 --> 00:29:58,980
Are you thirsty?

336
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:03,619
- You know me well.
- Sweet talk won't get you anywhere.

337
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,220
- Thank you.
- Doudou is so kind to you, Feng Yasong.

338
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,700
She is biased.

339
00:30:11,504 --> 00:30:14,380
(Script of Capital at Night,
exclusive for Qiang Qingci)

340
00:30:16,179 --> 00:30:18,899
Exclusive for Qiang Qingci.

341
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,659
I'm not supposed to look at this, am I?

342
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,220
In principle, you are not.

343
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:37,400
The last time I came, I was
in such a big studio for the first time.

344
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,099
There were so many people then. I didn't
have the courage to look around.

345
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,500
Now you can take your time to look.

346
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:52,139
This one is much more professional
and better equipped compared to ours.

347
00:31:13,899 --> 00:31:14,540
What's the matter?

348
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:20,740
I am thinking that we can start
getting to know each other.

349
00:31:24,379 --> 00:31:26,220
What do you mean?

350
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:35,579
We know nothing beyond each other's
online IDs, careers, and home addresses.

351
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,020
I'm 29 years old.

352
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,300
I'm 22.

353
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,780
I was born on December 14th.

354
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:52,519
Finally, I know
what day your birthday is.

355
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:56,460
I can't find any information online,
and you don't celebrate your birthday.

356
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:00,220
- We wonder what your zodiac sign is.
- Really?

357
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:05,899
- I was born on March...
- 20th.

358
00:32:10,339 --> 00:32:11,419
You know it?

359
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:13,819
Pisces.

360
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,740
I have to do my homework

361
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,139
ahead of time for my girlfriend.

362
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,500
So, what do you like to eat?

363
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:28,179
Me?

364
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:34,980
I went through all your Weibo posts.
It seems you eat pretty much anything.

365
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,419
It's hard to pin down your taste.

366
00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:39,980
I like strawberries for fruit.

367
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,419
I like grapes for fruit.

368
00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:46,020
For dishes, I like spicy ones.

369
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,020
Same as you.

370
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,580
- What color do you like?
- White.

371
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,419
White. What else?

372
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:54,260
Blue.

373
00:32:55,376 --> 00:32:57,619
- I like green and white.
- What are you looking at?

374
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:04,656
Why are you pushing me?

375
00:33:07,379 --> 00:33:09,579
Have they officially been together yet?

376
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,020
I think they must have.

377
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:18,500
They don't need to keep their distance.
They don't seem intimate at all.

378
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,139
Don't you know what he is like?
He is always restrained and secretive.

379
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,220
He's worried
that we'll say he's unprincipled.

380
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,060
Speaking of which, I...

381
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:36,339
You two

382
00:33:37,379 --> 00:33:42,340
- seem quite free.
- Free? No.

383
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:46,096
Can you finish that dubbing you owe me
by tonight? No more chatting, okay?

384
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,759
Didn't I give it to you long ago?

385
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:52,500
That is for last month.
What about the one for this month?

386
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,240
You still need to do dubbing for two
TV commercials and one animated film.

387
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,419
And over 100 lines for a video game.

388
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,179
- Alright.
- When are you going to finish them?

389
00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:00,859
You haven't finished the dubbing
for the game yet?

390
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:02,700
- You told her you finished it?
- I did.

391
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,859
- What are you doing?
- It's due tomorrow.

392
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:07,740
Stop yelling at me.
You're always keeping an eye on me.

393
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,020
They are dating in the studio.
Why are you keeping an eye on me?

394
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,980
Just put yourself together and hurry up.

395
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,579
- Alright. I'm leaving.
- Hurry up.

396
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:17,779
Look at him. He's slacking off all day.

397
00:34:22,299 --> 00:34:23,179
So unreliable.

398
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:30,739
Do you have a remix to do?

399
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:34,340
I'll do it right now.

400
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,420
As for the movie, I...

401
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,259
- Mao.
- You are chatting?

402
00:34:43,299 --> 00:34:45,540
I'll leave you guys to yourselves.

403
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:50,739
When will you finish?

404
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,179
It will be late into the night.

405
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:57,808
Then I'll go home first.
Let me know when you finish.

406
00:34:58,832 --> 00:35:00,980
- I'll call a taxi for you.
- No need. I'm fine.

407
00:35:04,699 --> 00:35:05,860
- Mao.
- Take care.

408
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:07,900
Goodbye.

409
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,739
I've seen it clearly.

410
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,020
She is pretty.

411
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:23,379
Without Tianshi Sect's circle, villages
would have been destroyed by beasts.

412
00:35:23,379 --> 00:35:28,939
I heard that the circles of other sects
were also taught by them.

413
00:35:28,939 --> 00:35:32,659
Therefore, they're the Alliance leader.
They have made great contributions.

414
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,739
Why are you defending those guys?
Did you forget their grudges against us?

415
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,140
You startled me. I thought
I was being assigned a new task again.

416
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:51,139
- It's your job. What are you afraid of?
- It's my first day here. I'm nervous.

417
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,420
There were too many people.

418
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,639
As your friend, I want to congratulate
you on getting your dream job.

419
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:01,540
Thank you, Gu Sheng.

420
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:05,380
- When will you record this?
- Tomorrow.

421
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,600
Today is my first day.
I simply recorded a demo for them.

422
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,700
I had to record the demo over and over
in the studio.

423
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,860
I feel apologetic
to the recording engineer.

424
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:17,439
They asked the best engineer
in this studio to record for us newbies.

425
00:36:17,439 --> 00:36:19,940
- Mao?
- Yes, it's him.

426
00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:24,540
- So, are you getting off work now?
- Doudou said I can go off work.

427
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,380
But many seniors are still working.
I dare not leave.

428
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,139
I might as well
diligently study the lyrics.

429
00:36:33,219 --> 00:36:34,099
Off Key.

430
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:39,099
Your work is done.
Why are you still here?

431
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,140
It's your first day here. You simply
need to cooperate with HR for paperwork,

432
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:50,640
and get familiar with your colleagues.
Everyone's time goes with the workload.

433
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:56,060
- Take the food given by Mr. Mo.
- Thank you, Doudou. Thanks Mr. Mo.

434
00:36:57,659 --> 00:37:00,020
Doudou, we'll be going. Bye.

435
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,380
- Bye.
- Bye. Take care.

436
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,619
- Don't be late tomorrow at 10 AM.
- Okay, bye.

437
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:06,340
- Bye.
- Bye.

438
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:13,579
- Let's have milk tea to celebrate.
- Then I want double fruit.

439
00:37:20,259 --> 00:37:20,739
Hold on.

440
00:37:22,299 --> 00:37:23,860
What? Did you forget something?

441
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,340
I think it was you
who forgot to give us an explanation.

442
00:37:35,299 --> 00:37:38,740
Why didn't you tell us
that he is Qiang Qingci?

443
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:42,139
- You don't see us as a family, do you?
- Confess now.

444
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:45,420
I am wrong.

445
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:55,619
You guys scared me by suddenly
coming in. I didn't know what to say.

446
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:03,500
I am wrong.

447
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,760
I am really wrong.

448
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,699
It's all my fault. I will make up.
I will reflect on myself.

449
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:18,480
- This must not happen again.
- Okay.

450
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:22,020
Well, we forgive you.

451
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,099
This must not happen again.

452
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:32,939
- So you guys are not mad?
- We thought Qiang Qingci would be mad.

453
00:38:32,939 --> 00:38:37,360
We treated him as a chef back then.
We didn't leave a good impression.

454
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,540
No, he likes this place.
I swear he said that himself.

455
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:45,820
He said it reminded him of the time
when Tianzi No. 1 was first established.

456
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,020
The conditions back then
were more difficult than ours.

457
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:53,392
They rented a place on their own
and made free work with enthusiasm.

458
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,960
He also said that his works back then
had fewer click-through rates than ours.

459
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,620
They would read 100 comments
back and forth several times.

460
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,400
- It's similar to our situation now.
- Yeah, right.

461
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,060
I check our club's comments
every night, or I can't sleep.

462
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:13,179
One day, we might be able to grow
as big as Tianzi No. 1.

463
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,980
- We definitely can.
- Keep striving.

464
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,900
- How was your first day at work?
- Right.

465
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,119
It was eye-opening.
The big studio is different.

466
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:30,160
- Let me show you employment contract.
- Let me see.

467
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,340
And there is a brochure,

468
00:39:34,779 --> 00:39:35,739
a portfolio,

469
00:39:36,779 --> 00:39:37,860
and my access card.

470
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,780
(Profile of Qiang Qingci)
When our club gets bigger, we also

471
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,759
(Profile of Qiang Qingci)
need to hire as formally as they do.

472
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:50,820
(I knew today.
It's December 14th. A Sagittarius.)

473
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,760
By the way, Mr. Mo made me
a big box of food. Have a taste.

474
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,460
- Where? Why didn't you say earlier?
- Hurry up.

475
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,299
(Go on.)

476
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:24,860
- This is too delicious.
- Off Key, leave some for us.

477
00:40:33,259 --> 00:40:33,940
(Go on with what?)

478
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:45,619
(Knowing each other.)

479
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,420
(You're quite strange.)

480
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,872
(What's strange about me?)

481
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:06,259
(You're keen to confirm relationship,
but we don't know each other very well.)

482
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:13,299
(I'm afraid
that there will be other suitors.)

483
00:41:15,259 --> 00:41:19,940
(We can take our time to know
each other. It's me being sincere.)

484
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,219
(What if we don't match?)

485
00:41:25,779 --> 00:41:27,699
(You've said this for the second time.)

486
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:29,940
(You should be more confident.)

487
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,968
Actually, besides joining the internet
and the industry earlier,

488
00:41:46,992 --> 00:41:50,500
and having a timing advantage
over later comers, I'm not special.

489
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:56,219
As you've seen these days,
I am very busy in real life.

490
00:41:57,299 --> 00:42:00,540
Maintaining a relationship is hard
for someone like me.

491
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:06,200
In our line of work, sometimes we even
don't have time for our sick family.

492
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,579
Because there are more patients
who need our help in front of us.

493
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:17,060
We hardly have any personal lives.
Let alone being with girlfriends.

494
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,739
(I understand.)

495
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,776
(What do you want to eat?)

496
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,460
Why are we suddenly talking about food?

497
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:44,499
I only have some spare time
to make you something tasty.

498
00:42:44,499 --> 00:42:48,099
As a boyfriend,
I'm not quite up to standard.

499
00:42:58,139 --> 00:42:59,139
Now?

500
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:02,540
I'll have it ready by tomorrow
and send it to your school.

501
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,619
But I can't decide what I want to eat.

502
00:43:15,779 --> 00:43:16,860
Any special requests?

503
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,299
Something appetizing and filling.

504
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:29,040
Actually, you can just
make a main dish that's filling.

505
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,340
This way, I won't have to get food
from the canteen.

506
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:37,099
