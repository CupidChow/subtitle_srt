=Episode 15=

25
00:01:41,842 --> 00:01:46,096
(That's because we met in the winter.)

26
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:47,417
Eat these.

27
00:01:50,496 --> 00:01:51,337
This is good.

28
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:57,576
- We have to listen to Mr. Mo to eat.
- Definitely.

29
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:58,437
Thank you.

30
00:01:58,437 --> 00:02:04,897
If it's too spicy, add some vinegar.
I just heard you say it was spicy.

31
00:02:06,537 --> 00:02:07,456
Okay, thanks.

32
00:02:08,736 --> 00:02:09,417
That's enough.

33
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:09,937
It's enough.

34
00:02:09,937 --> 00:02:10,456
Thanks.

35
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:19,736
I'm also spiced out. It's so spicy.
Can you pour me some too?

36
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:22,877
Should I give you a cup?

37
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:26,097
No wonder you were dumped
with such a bad attitude.

38
00:02:26,097 --> 00:02:32,417
Our breakup was peaceful. Men shouldn't
speak ill of their exes, understand?

39
00:02:33,977 --> 00:02:35,037
Well said.

40
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:36,176
Are you single?

41
00:02:40,016 --> 00:02:40,837
Single.

42
00:02:40,837 --> 00:02:43,417
I've heard online
that you have a girlfriend.

43
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:46,776
That's all gossip and rumors
they fabricated and spread.

44
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:49,957
Who did it? Clarify.

45
00:02:49,957 --> 00:02:53,196
I saw that post. Wasn't that
a girl called Shanshan?

46
00:02:53,196 --> 00:02:53,757
What?

47
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:57,057
She was wrapped around your arm
in the photo, smiling so sweetly.

48
00:02:57,057 --> 00:02:58,217
Don't you know he's single?

49
00:02:59,377 --> 00:02:59,937
I meant to.

50
00:02:59,937 --> 00:03:02,077
Who told you?
You can't just blabber, you know.

51
00:03:02,077 --> 00:03:03,537
I told you to stop talking nonsense.

52
00:03:03,537 --> 00:03:04,576
Getting anxious now.

53
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:09,717
Mr. Juemei is really nice.

54
00:03:09,717 --> 00:03:13,417
Sheng, do you have
any suitable single friends around you?

55
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:16,817
Around me?

56
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:25,977
Why? You look down on him?

57
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:35,657
No. I-I-I don't want
a boyfriend for now.

58
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:42,377
I can tell, you're single too.
Why don't you want a boyfriend?

59
00:03:48,217 --> 00:03:49,657
Why? I'm not done eating.

60
00:03:49,657 --> 00:03:52,377
I'll get you more soup so you won't be
thirsty from talking too much.

61
00:03:56,176 --> 00:03:58,077
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

62
00:03:58,077 --> 00:03:59,077
Let's take a picture.

63
00:03:59,077 --> 00:04:00,377
(Passenger Port)
Quite a long line.

64
00:04:00,377 --> 00:04:01,897
- He's here.
- Mr. Zhu is here.

65
00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:06,037
Let me introduce this to you.
We'll be taking a cruise

66
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:11,236
across the river from this dock later.
Soon we'll see the famous Lijiang River.

67
00:04:11,236 --> 00:04:16,917
It's mentioned in many literary works,
like "stretches of green mountains".

68
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:23,017
We can also see the pattern at the back
of the 20-yuan bill here. Let's go.

69
00:04:23,017 --> 00:04:29,697
I bought first-class seats for you.
We can sit at the bow to enjoy the view.

70
00:04:29,697 --> 00:04:31,417
- Thanks.
- You're so nice, Mr. Zhu.

71
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:32,376
Thanks.

72
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:33,557
I take it.

73
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:35,317
Such an expense.

74
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:39,957
I-I-I get seasick.
Is there another way to go?

75
00:04:39,957 --> 00:04:43,617
You get seasick? Even on a large cruise?

76
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:48,397
I've been seasick since childhood.
Once I get on board, I'm dizzy and puke.

77
00:04:48,397 --> 00:04:50,817
You can go by car. We have cars.

78
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:55,177
Many bad sailors choose to go by land.
The scenery along the way is good, too.

79
00:04:55,177 --> 00:04:57,617
Well, I'm going to take the car.

80
00:04:59,336 --> 00:05:00,656
Then I will accompany you.

81
00:05:00,656 --> 00:05:02,377
It's okay. I can manage on my own.

82
00:05:02,377 --> 00:05:03,336
Let me accompany you.

83
00:05:04,776 --> 00:05:07,177
Otherwise, you will ride so long alone
without anyone with you.

84
00:05:08,216 --> 00:05:10,776
Then you can't enjoy
the scenery by boat.

85
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:12,456
That's okay for me.

86
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:14,697
Alright, it's settled.

87
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:17,837
Let Zhou Zheng keep you company.
At least you'll have someone to talk to.

88
00:05:17,837 --> 00:05:20,697
I'm okay, really. You go take your boat.
I can truly handle it alone.

89
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:24,496
I'll accompany you, alright? I come here
often, but it's your first time.

90
00:05:24,496 --> 00:05:29,817
You accompany me. We haven't seen
each other for so long. Go with me.

91
00:05:29,817 --> 00:05:31,297
Return your ticket to me.

92
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:32,297
Give me.

93
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:38,016
Juemei, as the elder,
you take care of her for us.

94
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,257
Let's go.

95
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,277
Accompany us.

96
00:05:42,277 --> 00:05:43,057
Go.

97
00:05:44,737 --> 00:05:46,456
Don't worry about it.
Then we will be on our way.

98
00:05:48,257 --> 00:05:52,177
I'm really sorry for the inconvenience.
See you in Yangshuo.

99
00:05:54,576 --> 00:05:59,056
Rest assured. Juemei is good at
taking care of people.

100
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:01,257
Let's go.

101
00:06:07,177 --> 00:06:08,616
Follow me. Come on.

102
00:06:08,616 --> 00:06:09,416
Is this the one?

103
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,297
This.

104
00:06:10,297 --> 00:06:11,197
Just this.

105
00:06:11,197 --> 00:06:14,497
Why is this only three-star? I saw
a five-star one on the other side.

106
00:06:14,497 --> 00:06:15,576
No, this is the highest rank.

107
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,096
68. A good figure.

108
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:17,616
Okay.

109
00:06:17,616 --> 00:06:18,717
This one is big and long.

110
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:20,437
Watch the steps.

111
00:06:20,437 --> 00:06:21,337
Guys.

112
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:22,817
What great views of the mountains.

113
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,337
Good. Let's take a picture
and show Zhou Zheng.

114
00:06:26,337 --> 00:06:27,857
Hurry up.

115
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:30,197
Together.

116
00:06:30,197 --> 00:06:30,896
Let's take a picture.

117
00:06:33,737 --> 00:06:34,697
The breeze.

118
00:06:34,697 --> 00:06:35,337
Nice, isn't it?

119
00:06:35,337 --> 00:06:36,776
The breeze is so comfortable.

120
00:06:36,776 --> 00:06:37,776
Come on.

121
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:40,216
Get on. The boat is about to start.

122
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:41,237
The weather is good today.

123
00:06:41,237 --> 00:06:43,557
We'll take photos later.
Let's go in first.

124
00:06:43,557 --> 00:06:45,276
Go in.

125
00:06:45,276 --> 00:06:46,257
How beautiful.

126
00:06:48,137 --> 00:06:48,817
Let's go.

127
00:06:48,817 --> 00:06:49,836
Go.

128
00:06:49,836 --> 00:06:50,656
Let's go.

129
00:06:50,656 --> 00:06:51,576
Let's go to our room.

130
00:06:52,976 --> 00:06:53,957
There's air conditioning.

131
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:57,976
Our room is there. Today, nobody is
on the second floor. Sit anywhere.

132
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:00,496
It's cool.

133
00:07:00,496 --> 00:07:01,497
There's more inside.

134
00:07:02,737 --> 00:07:04,096
Hear. What you're saying.

135
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:07,077
Make yourself at home.

136
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:08,497
This place is good.

137
00:07:09,817 --> 00:07:10,757
The view is good.

138
00:07:10,757 --> 00:07:12,137
It's different.

139
00:07:12,137 --> 00:07:14,137
Just sit here. We'll order
some tea to drink later.

140
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:27,996
Come on. Don't just sit.
Let's play cards.

141
00:07:27,996 --> 00:07:30,677
Come on. Are you gonna
play cards, Feng Yasong?

142
00:07:30,677 --> 00:07:31,920
Sure. Come on.

143
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,556
Sheng, are you gonna play?

144
00:07:33,556 --> 00:07:34,957
No.

145
00:07:34,957 --> 00:07:37,797
Do you want some snacks?
I'll go buy some.

146
00:07:37,797 --> 00:07:39,316
I'll go with you. Let's go.

147
00:07:39,316 --> 00:07:40,277
Have a seat.

148
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:42,897
Do you have any new games?
Always the cards.

149
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:44,397
It doesn't require brain power.

150
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,996
I'll draw first. Come on.

151
00:07:45,996 --> 00:07:47,016
Then my turn.

152
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:48,077
Shall we go out?

153
00:07:48,077 --> 00:07:48,957
Okay.

154
00:07:48,957 --> 00:07:51,656
- A good hand. You better watch out.
- Draw your cards.

155
00:07:51,656 --> 00:07:53,397
Stop bluffing.

156
00:07:53,397 --> 00:07:54,257
Draw your cards.

157
00:07:55,697 --> 00:07:57,177
A good hand.

158
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,377
Only one.

159
00:08:12,497 --> 00:08:15,696
I heard before the landscape
was incomparable.

160
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,716
It's indescribable.

161
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:21,417
Let me take a photo for you.

162
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,257
Okay.

163
00:08:25,817 --> 00:08:27,576
Strike a pose. I'll do it.

164
00:08:31,857 --> 00:08:32,457
Is it okay?

165
00:08:39,857 --> 00:08:40,377
How is it?

166
00:08:42,257 --> 00:08:44,957
Do you want to take a photo with me?

167
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:45,696
Sure.

168
00:08:51,857 --> 00:08:54,257
W-W-Wait a minute.
Let me fix my hair.

169
00:08:58,857 --> 00:08:59,936
The wind's too strong.

170
00:09:03,257 --> 00:09:03,656
Okay.

171
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,656
Make it horizontal.

172
00:09:18,656 --> 00:09:20,217
But if it's horizontal,

173
00:09:20,217 --> 00:09:21,896
we won't capture
the green mountains at the back.

174
00:09:24,337 --> 00:09:25,656
You're right. We can't capture them.

175
00:09:27,497 --> 00:09:28,416
Then just keep it vertical.

176
00:09:35,536 --> 00:09:37,816
Or you could get a bit closer.

177
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,737
Wait. I didn't smile well
in this one. Let's retake it.

178
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:53,517
Mo Qingcheng, do you want
to take a good photo? Wait. Stop it.

179
00:09:53,517 --> 00:09:54,656
Okay, I'll take good photos.

180
00:10:01,716 --> 00:10:02,337
Look at the camera.

181
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:32,517
You'd think after seeing other people
in love so much, one would grow numb.

182
00:10:32,517 --> 00:10:36,496
But watching Qiang Qingci fall in love
gets me more and more excited.

183
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:39,737
It feels a bit like
first love, doesn't it?

184
00:10:39,737 --> 00:10:40,296
Right.

185
00:10:40,296 --> 00:10:41,497
Exactly.

186
00:10:41,497 --> 00:10:42,297
Doesn't it?

187
00:10:42,297 --> 00:10:45,537
Mr. Qiang is naturally innocent,
not like you.

188
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:46,717
What's wrong with me?

189
00:10:46,717 --> 00:10:48,736
You just look like a playboy.

190
00:10:48,736 --> 00:10:49,904
You don't understand.

191
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,197
Good looks don't equal a wandering eye.
Pass.

192
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,176
I only said you were a playboy.
I never said you were handsome.

193
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:00,917
You...

194
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:07,737
He's been single for years. I am not
less popular. Why did I end up alone?

195
00:11:07,737 --> 00:11:10,637
Come on, kid. Show some spirit.

196
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:11,617
Yeah.

197
00:11:13,776 --> 00:11:15,056
And you throw cards?

198
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:20,536
Show some spirit! Learn from Zhou Zheng.
He could give up the view for a girl.

199
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,776
Mu, translate for me.

200
00:11:26,377 --> 00:11:27,217
What's he saying?

201
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:34,977
It's his guess. As far as I can tell,
there's nothing between them.

202
00:11:36,577 --> 00:11:37,777
You're talking about whom?

203
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:39,037
Sheng's classmate.

204
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:40,277
The short-haired one.

205
00:11:40,277 --> 00:11:44,356
You didn't notice it, but since they got
on the bus, they haven't been apart.

206
00:11:44,356 --> 00:11:46,777
Quick. The back of the 20-yuan bill.
Let's all go to the deck.

207
00:11:46,777 --> 00:11:47,457
Let's take photos.

208
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:48,137
The 20-yuan bill.

209
00:11:48,137 --> 00:11:49,497
20 yuan.

210
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:52,417
Don't disturb them. Let's go upstairs.

211
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:53,097
Go.

212
00:11:53,097 --> 00:11:53,856
Upwards.

213
00:11:53,856 --> 00:11:55,416
Have some awareness. Don't bother them.

214
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:03,977
The two mountains on this bill
are right in front. Don't miss them.

215
00:12:03,977 --> 00:12:04,717
- Thanks.
-Thanks.

216
00:12:04,717 --> 00:12:05,424
Not at all.

217
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:11,437
Are we there?

218
00:12:11,437 --> 00:12:12,757
Where is it?

219
00:12:12,757 --> 00:12:14,757
I guess it's there.

220
00:12:14,757 --> 00:12:15,397
That one?

221
00:12:15,397 --> 00:12:16,817
Not there yet.

222
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:19,497
- Sheng, come up.
- Come on up.

223
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:20,377
The view is great up top.

224
00:12:20,377 --> 00:12:20,977
Let's take photos.

225
00:12:20,977 --> 00:12:21,696
You can see it here.

226
00:12:21,696 --> 00:12:22,897
Hurry up.

227
00:12:22,897 --> 00:12:25,416
They've all gone to the top.
Should we go up?

228
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,656
It's windy there.

229
00:12:27,936 --> 00:12:29,236
Okay, we'll go up in a bit.

230
00:12:29,236 --> 00:12:31,317
The higher you stand,
the farther you see. The wind.

231
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,557
Slightly higher.

232
00:12:32,557 --> 00:12:33,317
Let's take a photo.

233
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:34,356
Come on.

234
00:12:34,356 --> 00:12:35,656
One.

235
00:12:37,497 --> 00:12:38,457
Good.

236
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:39,637
What?

237
00:12:39,637 --> 00:12:41,637
What a beautiful sky it is.

238
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:44,016
Come on, everyone takes one each.

239
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:44,977
Have we arrived, Mr. Zhu?

240
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:45,497
Let me look.

241
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:46,657
Where are we?

242
00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:47,497
Just ahead.

243
00:12:47,497 --> 00:12:48,177
Which one is it?

244
00:12:48,177 --> 00:12:49,056
That one!

245
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:58,657
I haven't used bills for so long.
Do you think in another ten years,

246
00:12:58,657 --> 00:13:03,397
kids will still be familiar
with the 20-yuan bill?

247
00:13:03,397 --> 00:13:04,337
Possibly not.

248
00:13:09,137 --> 00:13:11,697
How come we're not included?
You're excluding us.

249
00:13:11,697 --> 00:13:12,457
Excluding us.

250
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:13,377
You hold this.

251
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:15,396
- That's too much.
- Everyone will be captured.

252
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:16,676
Are you ready?

253
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:17,617
Cheese.

254
00:13:17,617 --> 00:13:19,097
Cheese.

255
00:13:28,816 --> 00:13:29,317
It's raining.

256
00:13:29,317 --> 00:13:30,497
Why did it suddenly start raining?

257
00:13:32,737 --> 00:13:33,536
You're wet.

258
00:13:36,337 --> 00:13:37,457
Do you want to go inside?

259
00:13:38,656 --> 00:13:39,176
Either is fine.

260
00:13:41,016 --> 00:13:44,296
Just a pity. Who knows
when we'll come here again?

261
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:49,217
You go inside and wait.
When we're almost there, I'll tell you.

262
00:13:49,217 --> 00:13:50,097
No, you...

263
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:51,056
You wait inside.

264
00:13:58,737 --> 00:13:59,816
It's raining heavier.

265
00:13:59,816 --> 00:14:01,137
It's too heavy.

266
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:02,297
How can it rain so much?

267
00:14:02,297 --> 00:14:03,097
It's common here.

268
00:14:03,097 --> 00:14:03,617
Is it that?

269
00:14:03,617 --> 00:14:04,617
It rains frequently here.

270
00:14:04,617 --> 00:14:05,917
It'll stop soon.

271
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:06,857
Thanks.

272
00:14:08,857 --> 00:14:11,297
Why insist on
waiting outside in the rain?

273
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:17,437
The real scenes from the bill. Exciting.
Let's take lots of photos later.

274
00:14:17,437 --> 00:14:23,397
There must be lots of pictures online.
Why not just download them?

275
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:26,817
Mu, being too sensible
can make people dislike you.

276
00:14:26,817 --> 00:14:29,997
I've told him 100 times already.
He's just unromantic.

277
00:14:29,997 --> 00:14:31,697
Get ready to take photos.
We're almost there.

278
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:35,977
Just take a few. The mountains
all look similar. Photoshop them later.

279
00:14:35,977 --> 00:14:37,296
Got it.

280
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:39,137

turn up the temperature?

00:18:54,597 --> 00:18:55,216
Okay.

353
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:02,257
You came here, but you're not taking
a boat. You'll miss a lot of scenery.

354
00:19:02,257 --> 00:19:10,137
It was sad to think she'd be alone
in the car with no one's company.

355
00:19:14,297 --> 00:19:14,817
You're awake.

356
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:21,216
I saw you were sleeping when the car
just stopped, so I didn't wake you up.

357
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,517
What is this?

358
00:19:24,517 --> 00:19:30,017
It's hot milk tea. I was afraid it would

359
00:19:32,817 --> 00:19:34,057
It's raining now.

360
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:36,696
Didn't you get...?

361
00:19:36,696 --> 00:19:37,617
It's okay.

362
00:19:38,857 --> 00:19:39,577
You have a try.

363
00:19:49,617 --> 00:19:50,377
Is it good?

364
00:19:50,377 --> 00:19:51,537
It's really good.

365
00:19:54,097 --> 00:19:56,496
Of course, it's cooked
from real tea leaves.

366
00:19:58,537 --> 00:20:00,597
Sir, where are you from in Guilin?

367
00:20:00,597 --> 00:20:04,637
I'm from Yangshuo. After I drop you off,
I will go home for dinner.

368
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:11,497
Stay awake later. When the rain stops,
I'll stop for you to take pictures.

369
00:20:11,497 --> 00:20:17,976
Thank you. I don't care, but it is
her first time on a long trip.

370
00:20:44,256 --> 00:20:44,997
A pair of five.

371
00:20:44,997 --> 00:20:46,157
A pair of five?

372
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:47,256
A pair of five?

373
00:20:47,256 --> 00:20:47,916
Bomb.

374
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,416
It was just a pair of five.

375
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,617
- Why did you play that?
- Puzzling.

376
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:52,097
- Let me play this.
- Just messing around.

377
00:20:52,097 --> 00:20:54,337
What's this? Wait.
Why didn't you play a bomb just now?

378
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:55,457
I'll play one.

379
00:20:55,457 --> 00:20:56,656
He's serving food. Look.

380
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:01,097
I just asked. It's half an hour away.
Let's have this to kill time.

381
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:04,936
How can you always find
delicious food wherever you go?

382
00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:08,537
Because many of my friends are foodies.

383
00:21:10,297 --> 00:21:11,317
There's only one dish?

384
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:12,197
Go get some.

385
00:21:12,197 --> 00:21:13,097
Why don't you get it?

386
00:21:15,097 --> 00:21:16,337
- Here it comes.

- The environment is nice.
- It's here.

500
00:26:31,097 --> 00:26:32,717
I've got a sore back
from sitting for so long.

501
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,656
I'm almost stuffed to death from eating.

502
00:26:35,696 --> 00:26:39,436
Weren't you on a boat? How could you
still manage to eat so much?

503
00:26:39,436 --> 00:26:41,704
First, he served me a dish
of river snails.

504
00:26:41,704 --> 00:26:44,658
It's said to be bred in the Lijiang River
and it's fresh.

505
00:26:44,658 --> 00:26:47,917
I didn't finish it
before the second dish is served.

506
00:26:47,917 --> 00:26:55,857
Then came a dish of stir-fried shrimp.
I ate them all so as not to waste them.

507
00:26:57,777 --> 00:26:59,857
You're clearly showing off.

508
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:05,697
I was hesitating just now.

509
00:27:05,697 --> 00:27:07,097

510
00:27:08,696 --> 00:27:15,377
I was thinking about whether you
wanted to stay with me or him.

511
00:27:15,377 --> 00:27:17,256
Of course, I wanted to stay with you.

512
00:27:22,936 --> 00:27:23,976

into summer clothes.

514
00:27:35,537 --> 00:27:40,797

to order a room with a king-sized bed.

515
00:27:40,797 --> 00:27:41,816
Can we change it?

516
00:27:41,816 --> 00:27:42,377
No.

520
00:28:06,537 --> 00:28:07,137

521
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:14,417
I'll sleep there.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

522
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:16,936
Call the hotel to get
a new set of bedding.

523
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:22,437
Why not share a bed? See how spacious.
What are you going to do?

524
00:28:22,437 --> 00:28:23,256

00:29:14,696 --> 00:29:17,176
(Free activities today,
group activities tomorrow.)

533
00:29:18,496 --> 00:29:20,857
(Do you want to go see alpacas?)

534
00:29:23,297 --> 00:29:24,017
(After I dry my hair.)

535
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:45,603
(I've started location sharing.)

536
00:29:50,817 --> 00:29:54,097
Xiaoxing, I'll go out with Mo Qingcheng.
Don't wait for me tonight.

537
00:30:32,817 --> 00:30:35,317
You're moving so slowly, Sheng.

538
00:30:35,317 --> 00:30:37,017
I can barely recognize you.

539
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:38,617
Why?

540
00:30:39,696 --> 00:30:41,097
I've never seen you in summer clothes.

541
00:30:43,696 --> 00:30:46,537
That's because we met in the winter.

542
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:49,577
Try it.

543
00:30:58,976 --> 00:30:59,857
That one is big.

544
00:31:01,857 --> 00:31:03,216
And this side.

545
00:31:13,696 --> 00:31:15,817
Won't they get full
from eating all the time?

546
00:31:18,656 --> 00:31:19,577
That's a good question.

547
00:31:21,216 --> 00:31:26,617
Maybe we can let them digest. Let's go
for a walk before we feed them again.

548
00:31:26,617 --> 00:31:27,456
Okay.

549
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:32,137
A tandem.

550
00:31:34,137 --> 00:31:35,397
Can you ride a bike?

551
00:31:35,397 --> 00:31:38,064
Yeah, I learned it as a pupil.

552
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:42,897
But after a fall
when learning riding bikes with my cousin,

553
00:31:42,897 --> 00:31:44,034
I can't get on or off.

554
00:31:44,034 --> 00:31:49,797
I only do it with my foot planted
and choose bikes with the lowest seats.

555
00:31:49,797 --> 00:31:50,976
The lowest.

556
00:31:54,176 --> 00:31:55,537
How many cousins do you have?

557
00:31:55,537 --> 00:31:57,376
Five maternal ones.

558
00:31:57,376 --> 00:32:02,777
And also two paternal ones who are
much older with no common interest.

559
00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:04,857
Are you the only girl in the family?

560
00:32:04,857 --> 00:32:08,017
Yes, it's just me.
So they all call me their treasure.

561
00:32:09,496 --> 00:32:10,137
Treasure?

562
00:32:11,857 --> 00:32:13,017
Everyone dotes on you.

563
00:32:14,656 --> 00:32:21,557
I used to think it was quite good.
I could receive a lot of gifts.

564
00:32:21,557 --> 00:32:27,116
But then slowly, I didn't feel so. They
grew up and all turned like my parents.

565
00:32:27,116 --> 00:32:29,097
So, I got to have many parents.

566
00:32:30,656 --> 00:32:34,096
This time, a cousin even wanted to take
leave to accompany me. Terrifying.

567
00:32:34,096 --> 00:32:34,817
Just give it a try.

568
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,097
Is it okay?

569
00:32:41,496 --> 00:32:45,316
My parents don't have many relatives.

570
00:32:45,316 --> 00:32:48,836
I envy you since I'm usually alone.

571
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:51,216
No wonder you like being with them.

572
00:32:52,297 --> 00:32:53,337
It's obvious?

573
00:32:53,337 --> 00:33:00,137
You don't speak much, but it can be seen
that you like that lively atmosphere.

574
00:33:03,337 --> 00:33:03,936
Let's go.

575
00:33:06,857 --> 00:33:09,896
Don't ride in front of me.
I'm afraid I'll hit you.

576
00:33:13,377 --> 00:33:17,057
Also, don't ride next to me.
I'll get distracted.

577
00:33:18,137 --> 00:33:19,097
Okay, I will follow you.

578
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:19,617
Okay.

579
00:33:30,577 --> 00:33:33,017
I read in the description
that that's the Lijiang River.

580
00:33:33,017 --> 00:33:34,956
We can take a bamboo raft and go eat.

581
00:33:34,956 --> 00:33:36,656
Okay, let's scout out the path first.

582
00:33:39,057 --> 00:33:39,936
Slow down on the slopes.

583
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:40,577
Okay.

584
00:34:00,216 --> 00:34:01,337
Isn't it hot outside?

585
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:08,457
A calm heart keeps you cool.

586
00:34:10,017 --> 00:34:12,497
Stop pretending.
I know you. What happened?

587
00:34:13,816 --> 00:34:17,336
Those annoying kids are playing mahjong
in my room. I can't even take a nap.

588
00:34:18,776 --> 00:34:19,856
See. I knew it.

589
00:34:21,216 --> 00:34:24,816
Zhou, I want to tell you something.
Haven't I got six sponsors this time?

590
00:34:24,816 --> 00:34:28,037
One of them just withdrew
their sponsorship. It was very sudden.

591
00:34:28,037 --> 00:34:29,897
I knew it wouldn't be good news
when you came to me.

592
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,696
I'll make up for the funding. Carry on.

593
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:36,937
Rich and generous.

594
00:34:36,937 --> 00:34:37,696
The same to you.

595
00:34:42,376 --> 00:34:43,696
What's her name?

596
00:34:49,897 --> 00:34:50,577
Xiaoxing.

597
00:34:50,577 --> 00:34:53,556
Isn't it hot for you to sit outside?
After a short walk, I started sweating.

598
00:34:53,556 --> 00:34:55,077
Just now, I asked him the same question.

599
00:34:55,077 --> 00:34:57,256
We've ordered high tea inside.
Do you want to join us?

600
00:34:58,736 --> 00:34:59,776
There's air conditioning.

601
00:35:01,696 --> 00:35:04,716
Sure, but how do I get upstairs?

602
00:35:04,716 --> 00:35:05,376
From there.

603
00:35:05,376 --> 00:35:06,017
This way.

604
00:35:06,017 --> 00:35:07,137
Wait for me a moment.

605
00:35:11,497 --> 00:35:12,776
When did you order afternoon tea?

606
00:35:14,216 --> 00:35:16,977
Ordering it now will still be in time.
Just say you insisted on ordering it.

607
00:35:16,977 --> 00:35:18,456
Why are you pinning that on me?

608
00:35:18,456 --> 00:35:21,716
It has to be coincidental. Only then
can she enjoy it without guilt.

609
00:35:21,716 --> 00:35:25,397
When it comes to gentlemen,
you must be mentioned.

610
00:35:25,397 --> 00:35:26,417
Hurry to order food.

611
00:35:27,937 --> 00:35:29,377
- Go.
- You go order yourself.

612
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,537
I'm pulling out funding.

613
00:35:31,776 --> 00:35:33,597
Go. Don't dawdle.

614
00:35:33,597 --> 00:35:34,696
Xiaoxing.

615
00:35:34,696 --> 00:35:35,717
Mr. Zhu.

616
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:36,577
Go.

617
00:35:42,856 --> 00:35:43,577
You can sit here.

618
00:35:58,417 --> 00:35:59,917
Have you sorted out your things?

619
00:35:59,917 --> 00:36:01,176
Yes.

620
00:36:02,376 --> 00:36:05,417
On such a scorching day,
why were you walking outside alone?

621
00:36:05,417 --> 00:36:10,176
I wanted to take some photos
but I didn't expect it to be this hot.

622
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:16,216
Quite hot, so I invited you in
to eat something and cool off.

623
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:29,176
It will be ready soon.
This place serves Western food... Sorry.

624
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:35,357
Xiaoxing, as one of our partners,
are you satisfied with this hotel?

625
00:36:35,357 --> 00:36:38,777
Yes. This is my first time staying
in such a nice hotel. Thanks.

626
00:36:38,777 --> 00:36:39,696
Zhou Zheng chose it.

627
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:42,736
A friend of mine recommended it.

628
00:36:46,816 --> 00:36:47,897
The air is nice here.

629
00:36:47,897 --> 00:36:48,997
It's quite refreshing.

630
00:36:48,997 --> 00:36:50,696
My hometown has a good view.

631
00:36:54,577 --> 00:36:58,537
Sometimes, I-I-I just feel homesick
when I'm out of town.

632
00:36:58,537 --> 00:36:59,176
(Why?)

633
00:37:03,856 --> 00:37:05,696
(You need to transfer
the meal expense to me, 250 yuan.)

634
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:11,716
(Then I won't fund you anymore.)

635
00:37:11,716 --> 00:37:15,736
(Transfer the money and also support me,
or I won't act with you.)

636
00:37:18,057 --> 00:37:19,597
(Serves you right for breaking up.)

637
00:37:19,597 --> 00:37:21,977
Do I interrupt your work?

638
00:37:21,977 --> 00:37:23,376
- No.
- No.

639
00:37:33,577 --> 00:37:34,176
Look.

640
00:37:35,216 --> 00:37:36,336
These ducks are so beautiful.

641
00:37:38,537 --> 00:37:40,296
They're raised for eating.

642
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:51,736
They're too good-looking to eat.
Don't they look pretty?

643
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:55,296
Those white ones over there
are for laying eggs.

644
00:37:58,097 --> 00:37:59,577
I won't eat duck for a few days.

Let me go down
to see if the slope is big.

660
00:39:23,137 --> 00:39:24,417
Be careful.

661
00:39:29,017 --> 00:39:30,736

Let's go.

666
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:54,256
There's a bamboo raft.

667
00:39:55,336 --> 00:39:57,736
Excuse me, can we take a ride now?

668
00:39:57,736 --> 00:39:59,457
How many of you are there?

669
00:39:59,457 --> 00:40:00,317
Two.

670
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:04,096
Each trip needs four people,
so wait a bit more.

671
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,856
Then let's wait.

672
00:40:04,856 --> 00:40:07,457
We can't start the boat
until there are enough people.

673
00:40:07,457 --> 00:40:08,336
Okay.

674
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:13,577
It's too sunny here. How about
sitting on the vine chair over there?

675
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,137
Alright, let's go.

676
00:40:20,296 --> 00:40:22,437
Sis, slow down.
There's a big slope ahead.

677
00:40:22,437 --> 00:40:25,497
Hold onto the brakes with both hands,
or you'll be thrown off.

678
00:40:26,577 --> 00:40:31,617
I wouldn't have come with you
if you hadn't begged me. Don't dawdle.

679
00:40:33,256 --> 00:40:37,376
Isn't it almost our anniversary?
Do you want me to go on stage bruised?

680
00:40:42,897 --> 00:40:43,617
Sheng.

681
00:40:46,816 --> 00:40:49,437
What a coincidence. I thought you guys
left the hotel a long time ago.

682
00:40:49,437 --> 00:40:51,397
We're waiting to take the bamboo raft.

683
00:40:51,397 --> 00:40:55,728
We two just went and there weren't
enough people. Now there are four.

684
00:40:55,728 --> 00:40:56,563
Let's get on aboard.

685
00:40:56,597 --> 00:40:57,216
- Let's go.
- Okay.

686
00:41:00,617 --> 00:41:03,897
It's rare to see you dress up, Mr. Mo.

687
00:41:03,897 --> 00:41:07,476
People dress up for the ones they love.
Mr. Mo is no exception.

688
00:41:07,476 --> 00:41:12,336
You two are dressed quite simply, so you
don't have much interest in each other.

689
00:41:13,856 --> 00:41:14,716
He is provoking us.

690
00:41:14,716 --> 00:41:18,417
We've acted as a couple many times.
How can we be disgusted with each other?

691
00:41:18,417 --> 00:41:19,296
She's right.

692
00:41:20,897 --> 00:41:23,077
We should hurry and board
the raft before it gets dark.

693
00:41:23,077 --> 00:41:24,417
Hurry up, Doudou.

694
00:41:31,256 --> 00:41:32,316
Really not interested in me?

695
00:41:32,316 --> 00:41:35,816
You have been influenced by them,
wanting to fall in love?

696
00:41:35,816 --> 00:41:36,937
Me?

697
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:40,776
I'm pretty good being alone.

698
00:42:34,057 --> 00:42:35,637
We haven't had a rest
like this for so long.

699
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:39,057
Yeah, I've almost forgotten
what leisurely life is like.

700
00:42:40,577 --> 00:42:42,537
Just the recording studio
and the hospital every day.

701
00:42:44,977 --> 00:42:47,037
Did you two graduate
from the same school?

702
00:42:47,037 --> 00:42:52,517
Yes, we met online during high school.
He later helped me select my university.

703
00:42:52,517 --> 00:42:54,576
And I ended up attending
his university directly.

704
00:42:54,576 --> 00:42:58,836
Mo Qingcheng had a lot of classes,
so I tutored Feng Yasong.

705
00:42:58,836 --> 00:43:00,777
You only taught me math.

706
00:43:00,777 --> 00:43:02,017
So did you get in?

707
00:43:03,256 --> 00:43:04,036
Yes, I did.

708
00:43:04,036 --> 00:43:06,177
Then you're considered my senior too.

709
00:43:06,177 --> 00:43:06,957
That's right.

710
00:43:06,957 --> 00:43:08,417
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

711
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:11,417
I didn't dare to say, fearing
someone would think I was buttering up.

712
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:24,296
Look.

713
00:43:26,057 --> 00:43:29,256
Is it hollow down there?
Can I snorkel in?

714
00:43:31,497 --> 00:43:34,996
Yes, it's possible,
but you tourists cannot go down.

715
00:43:34,996 --> 00:43:39,776
What's down there?
Like the stalactite caves in movies?

716
00:43:41,296 --> 00:43:47,077
Roughly, every year when the fishing ban
is over, we often catch fish there.

717
00:43:47,077 --> 00:43:52,397
There are a lot of fish down there.
Hold on tight. The rapids are ahead.

718
00:43:52,397 --> 00:43:53,176
Okay.

719
00:43:58,336 --> 00:43:58,856
