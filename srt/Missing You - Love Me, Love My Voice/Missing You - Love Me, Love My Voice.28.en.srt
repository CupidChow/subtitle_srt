48
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:52,285
Look, many of his fans are limners.
They created many drawings for him.

- Qiang Qingci?
- Mr. Qiang? Really?

75
00:05:31,524 --> 00:05:34,324
- Is he really the one?
- You've worked hard!

76
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:39,365
Hello, Mr. Qiang. A few years ago,
I worked with you on an audio drama.

77
00:05:39,524 --> 00:05:41,125
I played your apprentice.
Do you remember?

78
00:05:41,404 --> 00:05:43,725
- Of course. Nice to meet you.
- Thank you, Mr. Qiang.

79
00:05:44,165 --> 00:05:46,204
- Keep going.
- No problem! Thank you!

80
00:05:46,284 --> 00:05:49,165
- I am particularly fond of you.
- May I have a photo taken with you?

81
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:50,245
- Of course.
- All right.

82
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:55,925
- Thank you.
- I'm one of your fans. I love your voice.

83

Come on, three, two, one, cheese!

86
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:06,964
Thank you for your hard work.

87
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:10,805
Mr. Qiang, you are my idol.
I entered this field because of you.

88
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:12,245
You are my dream.

89

to pursue their dreams.)

- Just take whatever you want.
- Thank you.

97
00:06:54,605 --> 00:06:56,565
There're new ones in the studio.
I'll go back and get it for you.

98

140
00:10:00,404 --> 00:10:01,284

141
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:07,005
However, I have outpatient appointments
at the branch hospital tomorrow.

142
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,205
After that, I will come to pick you up.

- What is it?
- It's nothing.

152

Dr. Mo, there's another patient.

00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,125
Yeah.

But I didn't get
an appointment this morning.

The nurse said you'd see
dozens of patients more every day.

162
00:12:16,284 --> 00:12:18,965
She helped me make an appointment
and asked me to take my chances.

She said it'd be up to you. If you're not
willing, I have to come next time.

I'll take on one more patient.

I have multiple elder brothers.

They've been protective of me since young.
They won't let me find a boyfriend.

169
00:13:04,804 --> 00:13:08,845
They heard my boyfriend
was coming for dinner today,

170
00:13:09,044 --> 00:13:10,354
so they'd all come.

171
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:13,125
One of them was on a business trip
in Beijing. He has returned for this.

- Since last night,

I've been particularly unwell.

174
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:23,284
I've lain awake all night,
tossing and turning.

175
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:27,205
This morning, my heartbeat quickened.

176
00:13:28,404 --> 00:13:29,445
What should I do, doctor?

177
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:34,164
You're experiencing too much stress.

178
00:13:35,924 --> 00:13:36,605
Yes.

179
00:13:38,205 --> 00:13:39,524
Issues regarding meeting with parents,

180
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,044
your boyfriend will handle it.

181
00:13:43,644 --> 00:13:50,284
You should eat well,
drink well and sleep well. Understand?

182
00:13:53,804 --> 00:13:58,485
I got it. Thank you, doctor.
You're awesome.

183
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,164
After your words, I'm feeling better.
You healed me.

184
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:03,085
- You're so brilliant.
- You are welcome.

185
00:14:03,605 --> 00:14:05,564
And for now,

186
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,284
you just need to get some rest.

187
00:14:29,884 --> 00:14:30,884
Need an electrocardiogram?

188
00:14:39,524 --> 00:14:41,764
If yes, I'll write you a prescription,
and you can come in the afternoon.

189
00:14:42,804 --> 00:14:46,524
If not, let's go out for dinner now.

190
00:14:56,644 --> 00:14:58,845
Why are you standing here?
I asked you to go to Dr. Mo for signature?

191
00:14:59,924 --> 00:15:01,684
Dr. Mo has scheduled a meal
with this patient.

192
00:15:02,884 --> 00:15:03,564
Now?

193
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:22,445
- So formal?
- Should I not place importance on it?

194
00:15:26,205 --> 00:15:27,485
- I need to change my clothes.
- Okay.

195
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,725
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

196
00:16:15,404 --> 00:16:15,965
Then let's go.

197
00:16:22,485 --> 00:16:24,205
- I'm not sure.
- No.

198
00:16:26,524 --> 00:16:28,965
- Dr. Mo, sign here.
- Okay.

199
00:16:42,444 --> 00:16:42,965
Okay.

200
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,764
- Done.
- Okay.

201
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:00,164
This is my girlfriend.

202
00:17:02,245 --> 00:17:05,005
- Dr. Mo, we'll leave you two alone.
- Let's go.

203
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:06,965
- Thank you!
- His girlfriend.

204
00:17:11,645 --> 00:17:14,084
It's your fault. They thought
you were having a date with a patient.

205
00:17:16,005 --> 00:17:18,844
It's you who discredited me
by pretending to be a patient.

206
00:17:20,564 --> 00:17:25,804
- Do you have a good reputation?
- Without a doubt. Let's go.

207
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:38,564
Isn't he here yet?

208
00:17:44,804 --> 00:17:47,645
Why are you so nervous?
It's her boyfriend after all.

209
00:17:47,804 --> 00:17:49,885
All of you left work early
and are back now.

210
00:17:50,165 --> 00:17:52,284
Especially the eldest brother,
who ended his business trip early.

211
00:17:52,524 --> 00:17:55,205
The elders are occupied with work.
As her brothers,

212
00:17:55,364 --> 00:17:59,205
- we must be concerned about her with this.
- Right.

213
00:17:59,965 --> 00:18:00,564
Jia.

214
00:18:01,925 --> 00:18:03,844
Adult men are a different story.

215
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:08,005
As married individuals,
my brother and I understand men the best.

216
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:11,405
What's most significant
is her thoughts. She likes him.

217
00:18:11,685 --> 00:18:15,524
- Well...
- Right. The key is she likes him.

218
00:18:17,445 --> 00:18:18,205
Wait a bit.

219
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:21,485
There's never a parking space
available here.

220
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:26,044
There is a ground-level parking lot
next to the shopping mall ahead. Go there.

221
00:18:28,005 --> 00:18:30,364
There are many items in the trunk.
Let's leave them here.

222
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:34,564
- What items?
- Some gifts for my first visit.

223
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,084
I am inexperienced.

224
00:18:40,524 --> 00:18:44,485
You park the car to the side.
I'll have them come down to collect them.

225
00:18:48,364 --> 00:18:53,885
- Grandpa, we're on the same side.
- Sheng. Where are you now?

226
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,124
Is there a traffic jam?

227
00:18:58,284 --> 00:18:59,965
Park in my parking space.

228
00:19:00,084 --> 00:19:03,764
- I can move my car. Nearby...
- Brother, listen to me.

229
00:19:03,885 --> 00:19:06,725
Parking here is challenging.

230
00:19:07,165 --> 00:19:08,725
And he is a stranger here.

231
00:19:08,885 --> 00:19:10,284
He is bound to lose his way.

232
00:19:10,284 --> 00:19:12,925
- Hello?
- It's your first visit. Your mom is nervous.

233
00:19:12,925 --> 00:19:15,165
- She asked me to give you a call.
- We are your elder brothers.

234
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:17,364
How is it going? Where are you?
Have you seen them?

235
00:19:18,165 --> 00:19:21,044
I'm busy.
We'll discuss it when I get back.

236
00:19:21,445 --> 00:19:24,205
- Stay there. I'll come to you.
- I can hardly wait.

237
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:27,445
We're at the entrance of the alley.
Come out and help us with the stuff.

238
00:19:27,445 --> 00:19:29,844
- Hello?
- Come get the stuff. We'll talk later.

239
00:19:30,324 --> 00:19:32,284
Okay! We're coming now!

240
00:19:32,324 --> 00:19:34,124
Can't I even inquire?

241
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:37,324
- Why aren't you responding?
- Okay, I got it.

242
00:19:42,564 --> 00:19:43,405
- Hurry up!
- What's wrong?

243
00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:45,925
- We need to move the items.
- Come on!

244
00:19:46,005 --> 00:19:48,844
- Hurry up!
- Not all of you.

245
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:51,645
- Don't frighten him.
- That's right!

246
00:19:51,885 --> 00:19:53,124
- I will stay.
- You just got back. Stay here.

247
00:19:53,124 --> 00:19:54,844
- I'm not finished yet.
- I'll go with them.

248
00:19:54,925 --> 00:19:56,405
- Can you?
- Of course!

249
00:19:56,524 --> 00:19:57,364
- Okay!
- Let's go.

250
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,364
- Come on!
- Come on!

251
00:19:59,885 --> 00:20:00,405
Come on!

252
00:20:02,364 --> 00:20:04,764
My brothers are hard to deal with.

253
00:20:06,124 --> 00:20:08,804
Don't smile later. Be serious.

254
00:20:10,885 --> 00:20:14,764
- Cheer up.
- Don't be so fiendish, second brother.

255
00:20:16,725 --> 00:20:20,124
- Be serious.
- They are here! Close the window.

256
00:20:20,445 --> 00:20:23,245
Don't go out!
They'll keep interrogating you.

257
00:20:23,445 --> 00:20:24,925
- Okay!
- Is this the car?

258
00:20:24,965 --> 00:20:26,084
- That's the car?
- Brothers.

259
00:20:26,524 --> 00:20:28,245
- Here.
- Over here.

260
00:20:29,405 --> 00:20:32,208
- Look away now. Go!
- Shouldn't we say hello?

261
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,124
No! Go! Just move the stuff.

262
00:20:35,124 --> 00:20:36,725
- What are all these items?
- We can't park the car here.

263
00:20:53,604 --> 00:20:55,564
Buddy, nice.

264
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:59,205
- Hello, brothers.
- Some goods bought you over?

265
00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:03,685
- Brothers, let's deal with the items.
- Get the items first.

266
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,165
- Get them first.
- Come on.

267
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,084
And this one.

268
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:09,284
- Look away now.
- Here you are, third brother.

269
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:10,925
- We must not park here.
- Look away now.

270
00:21:10,925 --> 00:21:12,764
- Won't he come out to help?
- He has to park the car.

271
00:21:12,764 --> 00:21:16,564
- What Vintage year is this wine?
- Don't gossip, second brother.

272
00:21:16,564 --> 00:21:18,965
Come on. Third brother. Don't gossip.

273
00:21:19,564 --> 00:21:20,764
We're going to park the car.

274
00:21:20,925 --> 00:21:24,044
You can park in my parking space.
I can move my car.

275
00:21:24,205 --> 00:21:26,324
- No need!
- Parking space?

276
00:21:26,324 --> 00:21:28,844
- Come on. Let's go.
- What's all this stuff?

277
00:21:29,005 --> 00:21:32,604
- Didn't he wear sunglasses?
- Second brother.

278
00:21:32,804 --> 00:21:34,645
- Come on.
- Third brother.

279
00:21:35,124 --> 00:21:37,965
- Let's go.
- Where to?

280
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:41,044
The shopping mall is ahead.
There's a parking lot behind it.

281
00:21:52,405 --> 00:21:56,685
- They're nice, but they chatter non-stop.
- It's okay.

282
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:01,764
They are here.

283
00:22:04,245 --> 00:22:08,124
Grandpa, this is Mo Qingcheng.

284
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:11,165
Hello, Grandpa. Hello, brothers.

285
00:22:14,965 --> 00:22:17,324
Hello, welcome. Have a seat please.

286
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:24,124
What are you guys waiting for?
Get the tea ready and cut some fruit.

287
00:22:26,885 --> 00:22:29,485
- What would you like to eat?
- Anything. Just go.

288
00:22:30,925 --> 00:22:33,965
- Dr. Mo, we are old acquaintances.
- Right, hello.

289
00:22:34,124 --> 00:22:35,205
Please have a seat.

290
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:40,645
- It's my turn. Hello, I'm Zhao Cheng.
- Hello.

291
00:22:40,645 --> 00:22:42,604
- Hello, I'm Shen Yao.
- Hello.

292
00:22:42,764 --> 00:22:43,485
A Chinese server player.

293
00:22:46,284 --> 00:22:51,284
- I heard you...
- No manners. The elder has yet to speak.

294
00:22:51,405 --> 00:22:53,925
Dr. Mo, can we chat?

295
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:55,965
- Right.
- Please have a seat.

296
00:22:55,965 --> 00:22:57,084
- Sit down.
- Sit down.

297
00:22:59,084 --> 00:23:02,965
- Grandpa.
- Did she mention it to you?

298
00:23:03,324 --> 00:23:06,205
- I have also been a doctor.
- Yes.

299
00:23:07,124 --> 00:23:09,084
Our family also has doctors.
My parents are both doctors.

300
00:23:10,885 --> 00:23:14,725
They are doctors. No one looked after you
when you were young, right?

301
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:18,645
I'm accustomed to taking care of myself.

302
00:23:20,564 --> 00:23:23,764
Sheng, are you aware of this situation?

303
00:23:26,124 --> 00:23:29,524
I knew. However,
he seldom mentioned this.

304
00:23:31,564 --> 00:23:35,485
- Have you just become acquainted?
- It's been a long time.

305
00:23:37,925 --> 00:23:41,445
Grandpa, what is your preferred tea?

306
00:23:42,645 --> 00:23:46,124
- I like fresh tea.
- Excellent. So does my father.

307
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:50,284
My father has instructed me
to bring you some fresh tea.

308
00:23:50,885 --> 00:23:52,165
- Good.
- Grandpa, have some tea.

309
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:54,645
- Say thank you for me to your father.
- You're welcome.

310
00:23:56,445 --> 00:23:57,124
Try the tea.

311
00:24:00,844 --> 00:24:01,405
Be careful.

312
00:24:02,564 --> 00:24:04,084
Is it truly your first time?

313
00:24:05,804 --> 00:24:06,524
What's on your mind?

314
00:24:10,645 --> 00:24:14,005
What are you doing? How could you
let the guest pour me the tea?

315
00:24:14,284 --> 00:24:16,005
He has just taken it away.

316
00:24:16,965 --> 00:24:18,245
It's okay, Grandpa.

317
00:24:18,445 --> 00:24:20,084
- Fruit is ready.
- Where's your etiquette?

318
00:24:21,245 --> 00:24:23,084
- Thank you.
- Come on.

319
00:24:23,685 --> 00:24:24,885
- Thank you, brother.
- Please.

320
00:24:34,604 --> 00:24:37,604
What's wrong with you
still standing here?

321
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:42,084
The guest is here.
Go shop for groceries for the dinner.

322
00:24:43,445 --> 00:24:45,965
- Let's go.
- Gu Jia, stay and have a chat with us.

323
00:24:46,005 --> 00:24:47,445
- You hear that?
- Okay, Grandpa.

324
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:48,685
- You go shopping.
- You guys go!

325
00:24:48,685 --> 00:24:50,764
- You too.
- Me?

326
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:52,645
- Come on.
- Come on.

327
00:24:52,645 --> 00:24:54,165
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

328
00:24:54,524 --> 00:24:55,844
- Go.
- Everyone?

329
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:57,725
- All of you.
- Go.

330
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:01,645
- You're the best, Grandpa.
- Enjoying the tea.

331
00:25:01,645 --> 00:25:04,084
- Thank you.
- Is there anything you cannot eat?

332
00:25:04,364 --> 00:25:05,084
No, brother.

333
00:25:06,764 --> 00:25:07,364
Thank you.

334
00:25:10,804 --> 00:25:12,524
- Where should we go?
- The wet market.

335
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:13,245
Stop!

336
00:25:16,124 --> 00:25:17,725
- You'd better get back.
- What for?

337
00:25:17,804 --> 00:25:20,844
- To listen to what they chat about.
- Come on.

338
00:25:21,005 --> 00:25:22,764
- Whatever they discuss.
- What do you want?

339
00:25:22,965 --> 00:25:25,324
- Go. Hurry up.
- Nothing, just an undercover.

340
00:25:25,965 --> 00:25:27,844
- You are a deep card.
- Wait for me!

341
00:25:29,165 --> 00:25:30,324
At the store, I first...

342
00:25:33,604 --> 00:25:38,165
- Why are you back?
- They asked me to have a chat with Dr. Mo.

343
00:25:41,564 --> 00:25:43,885
Do you play games on usual days, Dr. Mo?

344
00:25:45,324 --> 00:25:46,844
I can't play games.

345
00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:52,445
I usually enjoy listening to music.
I used to play basketball.

346
00:25:52,564 --> 00:25:54,524
But now I need to protect my hands,
so I'm not playing anymore.

347
00:25:55,364 --> 00:25:59,445
- That's great. Sheng sings very well.
- I know.

348
00:26:01,084 --> 00:26:02,205
She is also a talented songwriter.

349
00:26:03,324 --> 00:26:05,445
We got to know each other
due to the songs she wrote.

350
00:26:06,804 --> 00:26:09,245
I'm one of her unknown fans.

351
00:26:10,084 --> 00:26:13,165
That's right. I've heard it online.

352
00:26:13,245 --> 00:26:17,245
Lovers who appreciate each other
can last a long time.

353
00:26:17,364 --> 00:26:19,324
Lovers should appreciate each other.

354
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:24,005
- She is young, but she is talented.
- Yes.

355
00:26:25,245 --> 00:26:26,124
More accomplished than me.

356
00:26:27,405 --> 00:26:32,165
Dr. Mo, I'd like to share with you a song
that Sheng has recently composed.

357
00:26:33,324 --> 00:26:37,445
Grandpa, I'll take him
upstairs for a tour.

358
00:26:37,685 --> 00:26:38,485
Okay.

359
00:26:39,645 --> 00:26:41,725
I was in a good chat with Dr. Mo.

360
00:26:43,524 --> 00:26:45,205
Grandpa, we're heading upstairs now.

361
00:26:45,405 --> 00:26:49,044
- Take it easy. Feel at home.
- Okay.

362
00:26:49,564 --> 00:26:51,324
Dr. Mo, may I friend you on WeChat?
We can play games together.

363
00:26:51,324 --> 00:26:53,284
- I will learn to play games from you.
- Okay.

364
00:26:53,324 --> 00:26:55,685
- Sit down.
- Are you polite?

365
00:26:55,804 --> 00:26:57,685
- Was I wrong?
- It's his first visit here.

366
00:26:57,764 --> 00:27:00,044
Don't talk such rot!
Go away and play your games!

367
00:27:00,524 --> 00:27:03,405
- Have you been living here since young?
- More or less.

368
00:27:03,685 --> 00:27:06,485
Ever since my grandma passed away,
my brothers took turns to live here.

369
00:27:06,564 --> 00:27:09,844
I moved here after junior high school.
This way.

370
00:27:15,324 --> 00:27:17,284
This is my grandpa's room.

371
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:21,725
This is my room.

372
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:26,645
Can I come in?

373
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:31,485
Such a cozy room!

374
00:27:37,925 --> 00:27:39,925
- This is you in childhood?
- Right.

375
00:27:42,364 --> 00:27:43,485
This is where you compose music?

376
00:27:44,044 --> 00:27:45,965
All of my songs were composed here.

377
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:58,685
What are you looking at?

378
00:28:01,044 --> 00:28:03,445
I would like to know
about your sight from here.

379
00:28:04,965 --> 00:28:07,124
Just the streets and residents.

380
00:28:17,925 --> 00:28:19,925
I have had this piano
since I was five years old.

381
00:28:22,524 --> 00:28:24,925
You've taken good care of it.
You must not have been practicing hard.

382
00:28:25,165 --> 00:28:27,804
I practice every day.

383
00:28:30,005 --> 00:28:35,485
You told many lies just now.
You're not one of my fans.

384
00:28:36,645 --> 00:28:38,005
They could be too easily found out.

385
00:28:40,005 --> 00:28:41,844
Some are true and some are false.

386
00:28:44,364 --> 00:28:45,645
All false.

387
00:28:48,205 --> 00:28:48,764
Not really.

388
00:28:50,764 --> 00:28:54,405
- Alright, let's go upstairs.
- Okay.

389
00:29:04,165 --> 00:29:05,364
Be careful.

390
00:29:06,685 --> 00:29:07,445
You first.

391
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:13,764
Nice. The small courtyard upstairs
is quite cozy.

392
00:29:14,405 --> 00:29:16,324
I often jumped rope here
when I was young.

393
00:29:17,885 --> 00:29:20,725
Anyway, it's your house downstairs,
so no one's likely to complain.

394
00:29:21,564 --> 00:29:25,008
No complaints.
But someone called the police.

395
00:29:25,936 --> 00:29:26,645
So serious?

396
00:29:27,604 --> 00:29:29,885
Once I gained a bit of weight
and wanted to lose it.

397
00:29:30,044 --> 00:29:32,485
I couldn't fall asleep at night,
so I climbed up here and jumped rope.

398
00:29:32,524 --> 00:29:35,205
I felt quite tired after more than 100 jumps.

399
00:29:36,284 --> 00:29:40,044
I was pacing back and forth
and enjoying the scenery here.

400
00:29:40,205 --> 00:29:42,364
Then, the newly arrived neighbor
called the police.

401
00:29:42,485 --> 00:29:43,764
He assumed I was contemplating suicide.

402
00:29:49,524 --> 00:29:52,804
- Female crab.
- You're not skilled in cooking.

403
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:55,485
Crabs are not easy to cook.

404
00:29:56,005 --> 00:29:59,124
What are you talking about?
Grandpa likes it. Right, Grandpa?

405
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:03,925
Forget it. Wait for Sheng's mother
to come back to cook it.

406
00:30:04,485 --> 00:30:07,084
I'll hire a cook later to deal with it.

407
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:10,124
- You're too arrogant.
- All female crabs.

408
00:30:10,405 --> 00:30:11,485
Brothers.

409
00:30:13,965 --> 00:30:16,485
Brothers, let me try.

410
00:30:17,844 --> 00:30:18,604
You?

411
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:20,925
You can cook?

412
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:24,084
I learned a bit because my family
likes to eat crabs.

413
00:30:27,245 --> 00:30:29,005
This dish is challenging to prepare.

414
00:30:30,005 --> 00:30:33,124
Indeed. So, I just said I'd try it.

415
00:30:36,005 --> 00:30:38,564
Okay, we will wait for the meal.

416
00:30:40,044 --> 00:30:40,764
Take this for me.

417
00:30:45,084 --> 00:30:47,764
Sheng, Dr. Mo is working hard.

418
00:30:48,245 --> 00:30:50,524
He is trying
to conquer our family this evening.

419
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:53,284
Just wait for the meal.
Take this and hang it outside.

420
00:30:54,044 --> 00:30:55,205
- I...
- Go.

421
00:30:55,245 --> 00:30:57,324
- Be careful with your hands.
- Brother.

422
00:30:57,604 --> 00:31:00,245
What are you doing here? Get out.

423
00:31:00,245 --> 00:31:01,925
- Can you?
- I will assist him.

424
00:31:01,925 --> 00:31:03,084
- Cook the rice.
- So do you, eldest brother.

425
00:31:03,084 --> 00:31:05,524
- Take care, both of you.
- Bye. Yes, don't worry.

426
00:31:05,524 --> 00:31:06,925
- The vegetables haven't been washed.
- Bye.

427
00:31:09,205 --> 00:31:10,725
It's your specialty.

428
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,005
Only this one?

429
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:19,284
Will they search for recipes?

430
00:31:19,284 --> 00:31:22,284
It's not easy to instantly
master and apply. Let's wait.

431
00:31:23,445 --> 00:31:25,844
Grandpa is a master of local cuisine.
He's really picky.

432
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:29,524
He might just be in the line of fire.

433
00:31:30,124 --> 00:31:32,564
- Let's go.
- Grandpa, someone is preparing the meal.

434
00:31:47,084 --> 00:31:48,005
Pass me some flour.

435
00:32:09,084 --> 00:32:12,405
I forgot to tell you
I prefer thin strips of rice cake.

436
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:17,685
It's okay. This is for stir-frying.
I'll cut into strips for you later.

437
00:33:17,324 --> 00:33:19,645
I'm cooking. It's hot here.

438
00:33:20,524 --> 00:33:25,284
This is too easy for you.
I have to add something for you.

439
00:33:25,485 --> 00:33:26,844
I'm increasing the difficulty for you.

440
00:33:29,364 --> 00:33:30,725
Hurry up and focus your attention.

441
00:33:44,804 --> 00:33:46,965
- Does it smell good?
- It smells good.

442
00:33:54,725 --> 00:33:55,844
The crabs are ready.

443
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:02,725
- It looks nice.
- Grandpa, try it later.

444
00:34:03,925 --> 00:34:06,324
- Good cooking.
- The smell is good. Have a try.

445
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,124
- Have you washed your hands?
- Let's try it.

446
00:34:09,805 --> 00:34:11,285
Sheng, let's go to the kitchen
to help him.

447
00:34:11,285 --> 00:34:14,365
No need. Just set the table.
We'll eat soon.

448
00:34:14,365 --> 00:34:15,325
Really?

449
00:34:15,325 --> 00:34:17,365
There's no need.
He's already working on the next dish.

450
00:34:17,485 --> 00:34:19,124
Don't complicate matters.

451
00:34:20,405 --> 00:34:22,724
Okay! Let's set the table.

452
00:34:22,765 --> 00:34:24,365
- Right!
- Take the stools.

453
00:34:24,365 --> 00:34:25,604
Looks pretty good.

454
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:29,365
Stewed pomfret is ready.

455
00:34:29,365 --> 00:34:31,405
- So fast?
- He is a quick cook.

456
00:34:33,044 --> 00:34:34,485
This fish looks tasty.

457
00:34:35,524 --> 00:34:37,604
- Sauteed alfalfa with rice wine.
- Another one?

458
00:34:37,604 --> 00:34:38,965
Shrimps with scallion oil.

459
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,604
I like this one.

460
00:34:42,044 --> 00:34:43,124
- The fourth.
- Okay.

461
00:34:43,724 --> 00:34:44,805
Move the zizania there.

462
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:49,524
- Baked gluten and mutton pot.
- Here, give them to me.

463
00:34:49,805 --> 00:34:50,604
Be careful.

464
00:34:52,365 --> 00:34:54,885
You just let the guest
work alone in the kitchen?

465
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:57,124
Sheng prevents us from entering.

466
00:34:57,325 --> 00:34:59,604
Yes. Grandpa. Sheng chased us out.

467
00:35:01,805 --> 00:35:03,244
Apart from my aunt and grandpa,

468
00:35:03,244 --> 00:35:07,365
I've never seen anyone who can prepare
such a large table of local cuisine.

469
00:35:08,084 --> 00:35:09,965
Sheng is truly fortunate.

470
00:35:10,084 --> 00:35:13,445
Not only can her mother cook,
but her boyfriend is also a chef.

471
00:35:13,885 --> 00:35:15,204
- You're really talkative.
- I'll start with this.

472
00:35:15,204 --> 00:35:15,885
Don't move.

473
00:35:17,204 --> 00:35:19,005
I'll go and prepare the rice.

474
00:35:29,325 --> 00:35:30,644
Serve the rice.

475
00:35:32,524 --> 00:35:33,845
He's performing well.

476
00:35:35,044 --> 00:35:35,684
Just go out.

477
00:35:37,925 --> 00:35:39,485
We will wash in a moment.

478
00:35:39,564 --> 00:35:42,445
- If you stay longer, I'll starve.
- Okay!

479
00:35:46,805 --> 00:35:50,365
Let's raise our glasses
and welcome Dr. Mo here to visit.

480
00:35:50,724 --> 00:35:52,805
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

481
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:56,724
I'm also very happy to meet grandpa
and the brothers this time.

482
00:35:56,925 --> 00:35:57,805
Cheers!

483
00:36:02,885 --> 00:36:04,965
I didn't expect
you took charge of cooking

484
00:36:05,005 --> 00:36:07,684
on your first visit to our home.
We didn't treat you well, Dr. Mo.

485
00:36:07,684 --> 00:36:09,005
It's my honor.

486
00:36:09,524 --> 00:36:13,124
Sheng is the only daughter
in our family.

487
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,524
We have been shielding her
since her childhood.

488
00:36:16,244 --> 00:36:19,765
- So, we're a bit harsh on boys.
- Yes.

489
00:36:19,765 --> 00:36:23,084
It's for this reason
that she has only now found a boyfriend.

490
00:36:23,405 --> 00:36:27,445
- What kind of talk is that?
- I didn't have anyone I liked before.

491
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:32,204
Now you've encountered Dr. Mo
whom you like.

492
00:36:35,684 --> 00:36:38,644
- Grandpa, try some. He cooked them.
- Okay.

493
00:36:44,485 --> 00:36:46,524
Quite impressive, almost matching mine.

494
00:36:47,724 --> 00:36:50,244
Not even close. I hope to learn more
from you in the future.

495
00:36:50,485 --> 00:36:52,005
- Come often in the future.
- Okay.

496
00:36:52,005 --> 00:36:53,365
- Come on.
- Come on.

497
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:55,365
- Come on.
- Have a taste.

498
00:36:55,805 --> 00:36:57,164
Have a taste. I believe it's quite good.

499
00:36:57,164 --> 00:37:00,285
I want to try a vegetable dish.
Vegetable dishes require skills.

500
00:37:00,724 --> 00:37:04,204
This is absolutely delicious.
Can you tell me how to make it?

501
00:37:04,285 --> 00:37:06,005
- Okay.
- It's absolutely delicious.

502
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,564
- It's really good.
- Here. Welcome, Dr. Mo.

503
00:37:10,724 --> 00:37:12,285
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

504
00:37:13,925 --> 00:37:15,724
- This meat is truly excellent.
- So soft and well-done.

505
00:37:16,524 --> 00:37:19,524
- I'm glad you like them.
- The cooking time is well-controlled.

506
00:37:20,564 --> 00:37:22,724
- Not bad.
- Learn from it.

507
00:37:22,765 --> 00:37:25,564
- This takes a long time to stew.
- Stop gaming and hurry up.

508
00:37:28,765 --> 00:37:29,765
You'll never learn, anyway.

509
00:37:45,604 --> 00:37:48,885
- I want to introduce you to someone.
- Who?

510
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:52,405
You've met her,
but she doesn't know who you are.

511
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:55,684
Okay.

512
00:38:04,644 --> 00:38:08,044
- Welcome.
- Welcome. You're here.

513
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:09,885
Yiru.

514
00:38:11,965 --> 00:38:13,044
Boyfriend?

515
00:38:14,124 --> 00:38:16,524
Let me introduce you. He is...

516
00:38:16,524 --> 00:38:20,005
I know. Dr. Mo, the young talent
from the hospital across the street.

517
00:38:20,084 --> 00:38:22,084
A frequent customer here. I know.

518
00:38:26,285 --> 00:38:29,164
Hello, I'm Qiang Qingci.

519
00:38:41,325 --> 00:38:45,405
We've met a few times in the past,
but I never told you my stage name.

520
00:38:45,485 --> 00:38:48,204
- Because...
- I know.

521
00:38:48,845 --> 00:38:53,244
Upon recognition,
it would disrupt your regular work.

522
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:54,965
I know.

523
00:38:58,325 --> 00:39:04,885
I heard
you were going to take a back seat.

524
00:39:05,005 --> 00:39:07,244
I thought you were quite pitiful.

525
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,405
Moreover, Sheng has a new boyfriend.

526
00:39:09,405 --> 00:39:12,564
How upset you will be. Sheng.

527
00:39:12,765 --> 00:39:16,204
You two are really a couple now. Sheng.

528
00:39:16,204 --> 00:39:19,164
- Calm down.
- I can't hold it.

529
00:39:19,204 --> 00:39:22,204
I noticed the poster
you left for me this morning.

530
00:39:22,204 --> 00:39:23,765
I was quite upset.

531
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:27,365
She reserved that poster for you?

532
00:39:28,244 --> 00:39:31,684
Of course, who else could it be?

533
00:39:33,325 --> 00:39:37,084
- Am I considered a family member?
- Of course.

534
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:40,765
I accidentally became a family member.

535
00:39:41,164 --> 00:39:43,365
I'll treat you some snacks.

536
00:39:44,644 --> 00:39:48,084
- Hold on a minute.
- Get some more. We'll head to the studio.

537
00:39:48,164 --> 00:39:50,365
I'll bring everything for you.

538
00:39:50,365 --> 00:39:52,084
Take all of them. It's on me.

539
00:39:52,325 --> 00:39:54,684
No way. It shall be on me.

540
00:39:54,724 --> 00:39:56,724
If you regard me as a friend,
then let me pay.

541
00:39:57,124 --> 00:39:59,765
- Okay, then.
- Okay.

542
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:03,365
- Thank you on behalf of everyone.
- Nah, it's not a big deal.

543
00:40:03,445 --> 00:40:05,204
We are all good friends.

544
00:40:06,244 --> 00:40:08,524
Take some snacks you like.

545
00:40:08,564 --> 00:40:09,925
I know.

546
00:40:13,012 --> 00:40:14,604
(Wangjia Supermarket)

547
00:40:14,604 --> 00:40:17,232
- Okay. It's enough.
- It's enough. Yiru.

548
00:40:17,232 --> 00:40:18,124
- It's enough.
- Okay.

549
00:40:30,797 --> 00:40:33,648
(Weibo of Qiang Qingci's fans)

550
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:40,752
(Congratulations on your retirement,
Mr. Qiang.)

551
00:40:43,604 --> 00:40:45,765
Your table manners.
I don't know what to say.

552
00:40:45,765 --> 00:40:46,925
- Add some nuts.
- No.

553
00:40:46,965 --> 00:40:49,124
- Adding nuts enhances the taste.
- Nuts are delicious.

554
00:40:49,365 --> 00:40:50,325
He doesn't know it.

555
00:41:02,405 --> 00:41:03,244
What are you looking at?

556
00:41:05,244 --> 00:41:08,005
Those artworks created
by the limners for you.

557
00:41:08,524 --> 00:41:12,765
I planned to create a photo album
for you as a memento.

558
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:16,244
However, your fans love you more than me.
They are already making it.

559
00:41:58,765 --> 00:41:59,524
It's rum flavor.

560
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:04,644
My favorite flavor. Rum is a spirit.

561
00:42:05,244 --> 00:42:06,684
I remember the first time I tasted it.

562
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:10,164
I thought it would be quite odd
to combine it with milk.

563
00:42:10,724 --> 00:42:14,965
But it turned out to be delicious.
Sweet milk plus wine and red grapes.

564
00:42:15,684 --> 00:42:18,405
What a brilliant recipe!

565
00:42:27,084 --> 00:42:30,644
Your voice is perfect
for ice cream commercials.

566
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:36,124
I've done some before,
just not this flavor.

567
00:42:37,365 --> 00:42:42,485
You must be so confused,
having voiced so many commercials.

568
00:42:44,885 --> 00:42:46,684
I still remember them.

569
00:42:49,124 --> 00:42:53,724
Being at the top in voice acting,
all good resources are for you.

570
00:42:54,365 --> 00:42:56,164
Do you have any thoughts to share?

571
00:43:01,285 --> 00:43:05,965
As a perfectionist,
I experience significant pressure.

572
00:43:09,405 --> 00:43:13,644
So many eyes
are watching you with anticipation.

573
00:43:15,044 --> 00:43:20,644
Being the same is lagging behind.
Each work should progress slightly.

574
00:43:20,845 --> 00:43:24,684
Otherwise,
I cannot even convince myself.

575
00:43:33,005 --> 00:43:35,044
