25
00:01:41,904 --> 00:01:45,044
(Hello, Sheng. I'm Qiang Qingci.)

26
00:02:03,972 --> 00:02:05,132
Did you check Weibo?

27
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:08,731
Tell you what, I was almost in tears.

28
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:11,331
Do you know that my favorite
posted 20 minutes ago

29
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,652
on Weibo about his favorite voice?

30
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:16,451
I was so touched.

31
00:02:17,652 --> 00:02:18,891
I'm at work right now.

32
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:20,692
Let's talk
when we get home tonight, okay?

33
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:27,092
(It's not so coincidental, right?)

34
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:32,932
Yiru, have you eaten?

35
00:02:32,932 --> 00:02:35,051
I haven't,
but I'll get off work with you

36
00:02:35,051 --> 00:02:36,051
when your dad comes.

37
00:02:42,644 --> 00:02:45,104
(Wangjia Supermarket)

38
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:11,731
Sheng, do you have
a favorite dubbing actor?

39
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:19,372
I haven't really delved into it.

40
00:03:19,372 --> 00:03:20,571
I guess they all sound pretty good.

41
00:03:21,692 --> 00:03:25,532
There are actually a lot of good voices
on the internet.

42
00:03:25,532 --> 00:03:27,692
For example, in some of our TV shows,

43
00:03:27,692 --> 00:03:30,932
the actor might be the one talking,
but the voice may be not theirs.

44
00:03:30,932 --> 00:03:32,412
It could be dubbed by a dubbing actor.

45
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:35,171
I know.

46
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:37,171
And there are a lot of radio dramas,

47
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:39,171
in which voice actors gather
to voice their favorite novels

48
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:40,932
for sharing the same interest.

49
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:43,812
I see.

50
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:49,809
(Voicemail, Moqingcheng)

51
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:50,731
(Qiang Qingci?)

52
00:03:58,412 --> 00:03:59,972
(It's not that I don't want
to listen to it,)

53
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:01,891
(but your fan is right next to me.)

54
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:07,372
I know you're at work,

55
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,011
but I think something big has happened.

56
00:04:10,011 --> 00:04:10,932
You know what?

57
00:04:10,932 --> 00:04:13,171
Qiang Qingci shared our song
ten minutes ago.

58
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:14,252
I mean the one we made

59
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:16,932
ten days ago to celebrate
the 16th anniversary of his debut.

60
00:04:16,932 --> 00:04:17,451
I...

61
00:04:19,852 --> 00:04:23,091
Sorry, I played it on speaker.

62
00:04:23,091 --> 00:04:26,651
(Wangjia Supermarket)
It's okay. No customer anyway. Go ahead.

63
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:28,211
Thank you.

64
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:32,292
Let me catch my breath.

65
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:34,732
I'm going to tell you
another devastating news.

66
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,612
You know, when he shared our song,

67
00:04:36,612 --> 00:04:38,651
we wished him
to be out of bachelorhood soon.

68
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:40,531
And he said... Wait.

69
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:41,651
Let me catch my breath again.

70
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:43,732
He replied with one simple sentence,

71
00:04:43,732 --> 00:04:45,132
"Thank you, I'm trying".

72
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:47,056
Listen, it's not "I will try".

73
00:04:47,056 --> 00:04:49,311
It's "I'm trying",
in present continuous tense!

74
00:04:49,311 --> 00:04:51,551
I'll wager a truckload of cucumbers.
It's definitely Shengshengman.

75
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:55,451
I... I'll raise the bet.
It must be Shengshengman.

76
00:04:57,651 --> 00:04:58,891
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

77
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:16,331
(Gu Sheng, stay calm.
He is Qiang Qingci after all.)

78
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:18,411
(He hasn't really said anything.)

79
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:21,132
(Besides, even if he has,
it has nothing to do with you.)

80
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:29,331
(No, I can't stay calm at all.)

81
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:32,292
(It's not good to have too much contact
with someone who has a halo.)

82
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:33,812
(It's too easy to let my mind wander.)

83
00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:43,984
(Wangjia Supermarket)

84
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,211
Thank you.

85
00:05:53,211 --> 00:05:55,292
One of you can get off work,
and the other can go home for dinner.

86
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:56,331
- Thanks, dad.
- Thanks, boss.

87
00:05:59,771 --> 00:06:02,891
Dong, how was your day?
Have you gotten used to it?

88
00:06:02,891 --> 00:06:04,292
It's pretty good.

89
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:05,132
Thanks, boss.

90
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:10,768
I just finished a busy period.
I might sleep until midnight.

91
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,331
Just leave a message
if you need something.

92
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:15,411
I'll see it when I wake up.

93
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:18,091
Goodbye, boss.

94
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:18,651
Goodbye.

95
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:23,771
Sheng, you haven't left yet.
Aren't you hungry?

96
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:25,292
I'm leaving now.

97
00:06:25,292 --> 00:06:26,128
Okay.

98
00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:32,612
I can't find my keys.
Where are my bike keys?

99
00:06:32,612 --> 00:06:33,971
I know. Let me get them for you.

100
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:34,480
You don't have to.

101
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,284
Just stay here.

102
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:38,411
What's wrong?

103
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:39,211
She forgot her keys.

104
00:06:39,211 --> 00:06:39,891
Bye, boss.

105
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:40,571
See you.

106
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:45,372
Look, here they are.
You must have forgotten them.

107
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:45,891
Thank you.

108
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:49,584
You're welcome.
Sheng, your face is red. Are you okay?

109
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:51,472
Really?

110
00:06:53,852 --> 00:06:55,011
My dad is really not frugal.

111
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:57,651
He turns the AC so high.
It's making me hot.

112
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:59,571
Alright then, I'm leaving now. Goodbye.

113
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:00,172
Goodbye.

114
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:00,816
Goodbye.

115
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:07,211
Call me when you get home.

116
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:08,692
(Happy New Year)
Okay, just go back.

117
00:07:08,692 --> 00:07:09,492
Okay.

118
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,432
(Performing audio export)

119
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,211
Perfect.

120
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:47,292
It's already 11 o'clock.

121
00:07:49,531 --> 00:07:50,292
(I woke up.)

122
00:07:56,011 --> 00:07:58,372
(Didn't he say
he's going to sleep till 1 a.m.?)

123
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:04,411
(It's hard to stay up late, isn't it?)

124
00:08:04,411 --> 00:08:06,372
(Do you want to drink some water
and go back to sleep?)

125
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:10,172
(I'm reading emails.)

126
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:17,891
(That means he's busy?)

127
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:21,651
(Are you busy?)

128
00:08:24,091 --> 00:08:26,651
(I just have finished a song
and have some free time.)

129
00:08:29,252 --> 00:08:31,011
(What is it? Did you write it?)

130
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:35,771
(Whether It's Dawn or Dusk
in a young master's voice.)

131
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:55,411
The water fairy is about to leave
by riding a carp.

132
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:59,332
The spring night retreats
in teary redness.

133
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:03,051
Whether it's dawn or dusk,

134
00:09:03,051 --> 00:09:05,972
even ten cups of fine wine
fail to intoxicate.

135
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:10,691
When will the trifles of love end?

136
00:09:10,691 --> 00:09:14,372
Sobriety announces
the conferring of a peerage.

137
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,531
(You are really too good at picking.)

138
00:09:20,531 --> 00:09:23,372
(The nest lines of the song
are all here.)

139
00:09:26,612 --> 00:09:27,651
Exactly this song.

140
00:09:29,732 --> 00:09:33,212
The lyrics are quite interesting.
I just found them.

141
00:09:48,492 --> 00:09:50,972
(Next time, don't stay so late.
It's very damaging to your voice.)

142
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:56,016
(Go get some sesame oil in the kitchen,
and take a small sip.)

143
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:57,291
(You'll feel better tomorrow morning.)

144
00:10:00,372 --> 00:10:01,452
(Will it work?)

145
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:11,411
Sesame oil...

146
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:29,252
(Better indeed.)

147
00:10:53,931 --> 00:10:54,931
(I've had some.)

148
00:10:57,132 --> 00:10:59,612
(Typing is a bit tiresome.
Can we have voice chat?)

149
00:11:14,212 --> 00:11:14,811
(OK.)

150
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,684
(Moqingcheng has invited you
to a voice call)

151
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:20,592
Hello?

152
00:11:21,852 --> 00:11:22,452
I'm listening.

153
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:25,011
You may go on then.

154
00:11:26,732 --> 00:11:27,891
(Go on? With what?)

155
00:11:30,852 --> 00:11:33,811
I just went to drink some sesame oil.

156
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:35,811
Aren't you sleepy now?

157
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:39,092
I just woke up,
thinking of finding something to eat.

158
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,931
(Silence is even more awkward.)

159
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:51,252
I just went to the kitchen
and saw the conch meat my mom prepared.

160
00:11:52,304 --> 00:11:52,852
Really?

161
00:11:52,852 --> 00:11:56,411
Tomorrow noon,
we might eat scalded conch meat slices.

162
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:58,051
Actually, I quite like it.

163
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:00,972
I will check the recipe.

164
00:12:07,011 --> 00:12:07,612
You are awake.

165
00:12:08,468 --> 00:12:09,136
(Sheng)

166
00:12:10,732 --> 00:12:11,972
How much longer do you guys need?

167
00:12:11,972 --> 00:12:14,531
About an hour. We're almost done.

168
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:15,931
By the way, don't leave.

169
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:18,132
Once they're done recording,
I'll record your parts.

170
00:12:18,132 --> 00:12:20,212
After finishing recording,
we can go out and eat something.

171
00:12:20,212 --> 00:12:20,811
Okay.

172
00:12:27,771 --> 00:12:29,092
I'll start reading.

173
00:12:33,572 --> 00:12:38,732
Cut the conch meat into large slices,
and rinse them clean with warm water.

174
00:12:38,732 --> 00:12:41,691
Blanch the flowering cabbages
and mushroom with boiling water.

175
00:12:41,691 --> 00:12:46,011
Mix chopped spring onions and ginger
with rice wine and water to get juice.

176
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:47,952
Then mince the chicken meat

177
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:51,252
and knead it into balls
with a diameter of about one centimeter.

178
00:12:51,252 --> 00:12:55,291
Then scald the conch slices
and chicken meat balls in boiling water.

179
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,811
Finally,
pour everything hot into the soup bowl.

180
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:00,771
It will be ready to eat.

181
00:13:03,171 --> 00:13:05,452
I know
it's a famous dish in Shandong cuisine.

182
00:13:10,132 --> 00:13:11,171
I seem even hungrier now.

183
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:17,332
I was wrong.
I shouldn't talk about food at night.

184
00:13:17,332 --> 00:13:18,011
It's okay.

185
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:22,252
It's getting a bit late now.

186
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:24,092
Are you going to sleep?

187
00:13:25,891 --> 00:13:27,531
Almost.

188
00:13:27,531 --> 00:13:30,691
Then rest early. Good night.

189
00:13:30,691 --> 00:13:31,452
Good night.

190
00:13:42,092 --> 00:13:42,891
Good night.

191
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:03,132
What are you doing?

192
00:14:03,132 --> 00:14:04,232
Ordering takeout for everyone.

193
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,291
I heard you booked a recording studio.

194
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,612
Are you going to meet Shengshengman?

195
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:12,852
It's for work.

196
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:14,852
Mr. Mo.

197
00:14:15,852 --> 00:14:16,651
Are you...

198
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:22,051
He's the new intern, Xiyou,
responsible for the receptionist work.

199
00:14:22,051 --> 00:14:26,252
If you need to print documents
or order takeout, just ask him.

200
00:14:26,252 --> 00:14:26,931
Hello, Mr. Mo.

201
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:29,651
Hello, Xiyou.

202
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:33,051
Mr. Mo, do you have an online name?

203
00:14:34,092 --> 00:14:36,372
No sharing of work photos.

204
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:38,492
No sharing of employee information.

205
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:39,771
Didn't Doudou tell you?

206
00:14:39,771 --> 00:14:43,332
She did. And I signed a contract
that includes a NDA.

207
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:47,452
So Mr. Mo, are you really Qiang Qingci?

208
00:14:51,452 --> 00:14:53,011
Yes, I am.

209
00:14:53,011 --> 00:14:53,531
M...

210
00:14:53,531 --> 00:14:55,771
Find out
what everyone wants to eat for me.

211
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:58,252
I'm treating tonight. Thank you.

212
00:14:58,252 --> 00:14:59,972
Sure, you're welcome.

213
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:06,132
M-Mao...

214
00:15:06,132 --> 00:15:08,891
Enough. I know you're excited.

215
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:11,291
Mao, I've been his fan for many years.

216
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,011
It's not because he's famous,

217
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:14,171
but that I really like his work.

218
00:15:14,171 --> 00:15:16,252
Understood. Listen.

219
00:15:16,252 --> 00:15:18,291
If you learn voice acting well
at Perfect Voice,

220
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:22,092
you'll witness the birth
of more of his outstanding works.

221
00:15:22,092 --> 00:15:23,051
Okay, Mao.

222
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:24,372
Young man!

223
00:15:24,372 --> 00:15:27,092
Mao, what do you want to eat tonight?
I'll order for you.

224
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:27,856
Don't get too excited.

225
00:15:37,372 --> 00:15:40,411
(Weibo post of Xiyou)
(My first day as an intern in the recording studio.)

226
00:15:40,411 --> 00:15:43,612
(And I actually saw my idol,
Qiang Qingci.)

227
00:15:43,612 --> 00:15:45,651
(Idol, please rest assured.
As I promised,)

228
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:48,771
(I will never
leak any of your photos or information.)

229
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:51,011
(But, can I just be honest?)

230
00:15:51,011 --> 00:15:53,291
(Idol, you truly are so handsome.)

231
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,411
(Lucky you, Shengshengman.)

232
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:01,452
Aren't you curious about
what Qiang Qingci looks like?

233
00:16:05,212 --> 00:16:08,291
Actually, it's alright.

234
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:12,411
'Alright'?
He's been your idol for so many years.

235
00:16:15,811 --> 00:16:19,811
Many people online know each other
for years without meeting face to face.

236
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:20,612
It's quite normal.

237
00:16:22,011 --> 00:16:22,852
Keep concealing.

238
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:25,051
I'm not concealing.

239
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:31,931
Aren't you the least bit
curious about his looks?

240
00:16:33,811 --> 00:16:37,011
No. I'm going to play piano for a while.

241
00:16:57,011 --> 00:17:00,891
I'm going to our studio to record a song
in a couple of days.

242
00:17:00,891 --> 00:17:02,448
What song are you recording
on a major holiday?

243
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:06,411
It's the pre-release
in collaboration with the Perfect Voice.

244
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:08,292
I promised them during the New Year.

245
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:10,572
I recorded a demo during these days
and gave it to them.

246
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,411
Seems they're not quite satisfied
with it on their side.

247
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:13,872
We've discussed
about doing a re-recording.

248
00:17:13,872 --> 00:17:15,772
Our studio just got prepared,

249
00:17:15,772 --> 00:17:18,411
so the effect might be better
if we record there.

250
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:20,572
No problem. I'll give you the door card.
You can go anytime.

251
00:17:22,211 --> 00:17:24,731
But our studio
hires freelance sound engineers.

252
00:17:24,731 --> 00:17:26,992
During such a major holiday,
there may be no one available for you.

253
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:28,971
Well...

254
00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:35,760
(Voicemail from Moqingcheng)

255
00:17:41,731 --> 00:17:43,332
How did
the scalded conch meat slices taste?

256
00:17:49,772 --> 00:17:54,211
(Oh, my God. Gu Sheng,)
are you fantasizing about him?

257
00:17:55,812 --> 00:17:57,691
(No, no, no.)

258
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:01,132
(It must be the rumors
that gave me the psychological hint.)

259
00:18:01,132 --> 00:18:03,372
(He has no feelings for me.
Absolutely no feelings.)

260
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:08,292
(I must not over-interpret things.
Wake up. Wake up.)

261
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:10,651
(Don't take everything
on the internet seriously.)

262
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:16,612
(It's quite tasty.)

263
00:18:25,491 --> 00:18:26,812
(Have you eaten?)

264
00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:34,092
(I'm having a boxed lunch.)

265
00:18:36,572 --> 00:18:37,372
(Are you not at home?)

266
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:43,491
(Didn't somebody mention you in Weibo,
saying they saw me at the studio?)

267
00:18:53,691 --> 00:18:55,292
(I haven't gotten around
to checking Weibo.)

268
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:03,012
I heard you weren't very satisfied
with the demo.

269
00:19:12,411 --> 00:19:15,852
If it could be recorded in the studio,
the effect would be much better.

270
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:21,411
But the current effect
is almost all right.

271
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,552
I've scheduled the recording time
for this song with the planner

272
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,504
and booked the recording studio.

273
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:31,344
That's great if you have...

274
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:35,092
(He scheduled a time
and booked the studio?)

275
00:19:36,651 --> 00:19:39,092
(He means he wants to record with me?)

276
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:43,891
What's wrong?

277
00:19:45,772 --> 00:19:46,691
Nothing.

278
00:19:50,012 --> 00:19:53,451
(He means he wants to meet me.)

279
00:20:03,171 --> 00:20:04,891
It's temporarily set for Sunday
at 3:00 p.m.

280
00:20:06,612 --> 00:20:07,332
See you on Sunday.

281
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:13,292
See you on Sunday.

282
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,251
Who are you going to see on Sunday?
What demo are you going to record?

283
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:18,171
Do I know him?

284
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:23,491
Nothing. A friend wants me
to help him record a song.

285
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:24,651
Friend? What friend?

286
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,612
It's someone you don't know.
I'll continue to play.

Yes, I know.

if I were a boy.

Is Mr. Qiang Qingci not coming today?

347

He has something urgent to deal with.

348

But don't worry. He's entrusted me
to take good care of you

350
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,651
and not let these guys scare you.

00:25:27,451 --> 00:25:29,092
I heard the lead actress is here.

356
00:25:29,092 --> 00:25:31,171
I can't even happily sleep knowing this.

357
00:25:31,171 --> 00:25:33,171
Let me introduce myself. I'm Wang Ke.

358
00:25:35,012 --> 00:25:36,411
Hello.

359
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:38,451
We were talking about
not getting scared by you guys.

360
00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:40,251
Please don't mind.
We've known each other for years.

361
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:41,211
We just like to joke around.

362
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,092
It's completely okay.

363
00:25:44,092 --> 00:25:44,971
Yeah, joking around.

364
00:25:46,052 --> 00:25:47,731
Pour a glass of water.

365
00:25:47,731 --> 00:25:48,931
She's right. Just go.

366
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:50,612
You, go pour a glass of water. Quickly.

367
00:25:50,612 --> 00:25:51,411
Okay.

368
00:25:52,411 --> 00:25:53,572
I'll do it.

369
00:25:53,572 --> 00:25:54,608
Look at Xiyou.

370
00:25:55,664 --> 00:25:57,691
Look at how proactive he is.

371
00:26:03,491 --> 00:26:05,332
You will have to record later.

372
00:26:05,332 --> 00:26:07,411
So I poured some warm water for you.

373
00:26:07,411 --> 00:26:08,211
Thank you.

374
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:09,171
Considerate, huh?

375
00:26:16,012 --> 00:26:16,891
Drink it.

376
00:26:19,171 --> 00:26:22,171
I have to go back to school in a bit.

377
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:26,532
Then let's hurry up
and get down to business, okay?

378
00:26:26,532 --> 00:26:27,451
Yeah. Right. Let's do it.

379
00:26:27,451 --> 00:26:29,012
Or Shengshengman
will be late for going back.

380
00:26:29,012 --> 00:26:31,292
That's right. The lyrics
have been printed and placed inside.

381
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:33,248
But you probably don't need them
since you've memorized them all, right?

382
00:26:33,852 --> 00:26:35,171
Since Mr. Mo can't make it back,

383
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:38,572
it'll just be you, me, Wang Ke,
and Doudou, the four of us recording.

384
00:26:38,572 --> 00:26:40,852
Two people need to stay to
deliver the vocals and match the timing.

385
00:26:40,852 --> 00:26:42,612
She needs to go back to school.
Let her record first.

386
00:26:42,612 --> 00:26:43,292
Okay.

387
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:44,772
It's okay for me anyway.

388
00:26:44,772 --> 00:26:46,491
- It's fine.
- You go first.

389
00:26:46,491 --> 00:26:48,092
We'll be here all the time.
There's no rush.

390
00:26:48,092 --> 00:26:49,971
- Right. Come on.
- Let's go.

391
00:26:49,971 --> 00:26:50,544
Let's go.

392
00:26:51,772 --> 00:26:53,651
So Sheng records first, right?

393
00:26:53,651 --> 00:26:55,132
I'll adjust the microphone for you.

394
00:26:55,132 --> 00:26:56,651
Give me the backpack.

395
00:26:56,651 --> 00:26:57,451
Thank you.

396
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:58,128
Go ahead.

397
00:27:44,891 --> 00:27:46,052
Can you hear me?

398
00:27:47,772 --> 00:27:48,891
Yes.

399
00:27:48,891 --> 00:27:51,572
You are too close to the microphone.
Can you move back a bit?

400
00:27:54,332 --> 00:27:56,332
- That's right.
- She's a bit nervous.

401
00:27:56,332 --> 00:27:57,891
Alright.
If you are ready, let's get started.

As far as I know,

403
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:19,372
Shengshengman is definitely not simple.

404
00:28:19,372 --> 00:28:20,612
- Right.
- She and Mr. Mo...

405
00:28:23,132 --> 00:28:24,092
Mr. Mo.

Is that a photo or a video, Mr. Mo?

462
00:32:51,931 --> 00:32:55,411
You haven't secretly
posted a video online, have you?

463
00:32:55,411 --> 00:32:56,971

We've met before.

466
00:33:08,292 --> 00:33:10,651
I'm just not sure if you remember.

467
00:33:12,251 --> 00:33:16,171
I do. You were walking a dog.

468
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:23,171
I never thought it would be you.

469
00:33:24,812 --> 00:33:27,132
Likewise. I didn't expect it to be you.

470
00:33:28,612 --> 00:33:32,971
Wait. What are you guys talking about?
We don't quite understand.

471
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:34,532
Wait. How did you guys meet?

472
00:33:34,532 --> 00:33:35,491

and make a fuss.

00:33:41,008 --> 00:33:41,532
Alright.

476
00:33:41,532 --> 00:33:44,411
They met before
but saying it's the first time.

477
00:33:47,052 --> 00:33:49,012
I'll go record first. Let's talk later.

478
00:33:51,852 --> 00:33:53,052
Ask later.

479
00:33:53,052 --> 00:33:53,891
Why don't you ask?

480
00:33:53,891 --> 00:33:54,812
You ask.

481
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:08,052
Just ask.

482
00:34:09,052 --> 00:34:10,932
Sheng, how did you...

483
00:34:10,932 --> 00:34:11,932
What are you two up to?

484
00:34:11,932 --> 00:34:13,811
Sheng, we shouldn't linger here.

485
00:34:13,811 --> 00:34:16,291
Let me take you to have a look around.

486
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:17,291
Doudou.

487
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:20,211
My favorite place is here, the pantry.

488
00:34:21,932 --> 00:34:23,412
Doudou.

489
00:34:23,412 --> 00:34:26,492
Here we have beverages,
fruits, and snacks.

490
00:34:26,492 --> 00:34:27,251
Help yourself.

491
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:31,851
There's quite a variety
of things available here.

492
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:34,171
You even have game machines
and the medical kit.

493
00:34:34,171 --> 00:34:36,171
They don't usually
take care of their health.

494
00:34:36,171 --> 00:34:37,572
I have to prepare everything.

495
00:34:37,572 --> 00:34:40,816
We have stomach medicine
and cold medicine inside. Sit down.

496
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:46,771
Doudou, you are so thoughtful.

497
00:34:46,771 --> 00:34:50,492
It's mainly because we've worked together
for so many years.

498
00:34:50,492 --> 00:34:52,412
We're like a family now.

499
00:34:52,412 --> 00:34:54,691
I heard from Juemei
you're a senior this year.

500
00:34:54,691 --> 00:34:55,472
Did you find a job?

501
00:34:56,532 --> 00:34:57,771
I got accepted into graduate school.

502
00:34:57,771 --> 00:35:01,040
A top student, huh?
You and Mo Qingcheng are quite alike.

503
00:35:02,096 --> 00:35:03,452
Does he also have good grades?

504
00:35:03,452 --> 00:35:07,012
More than good. He basically advances
without having to take tests.

505
00:35:07,012 --> 00:35:08,251
So I said you two are alike.

506
00:35:09,851 --> 00:35:14,736
Sheng, where did you meet
Mo Qingcheng before?

507
00:35:18,771 --> 00:35:20,211
You can't say it
because it's a special place?

508
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:23,132
He won't let you say it, right?

509
00:35:23,132 --> 00:35:26,851
No, it was just a coincidence.

510
00:35:26,851 --> 00:35:28,932
We met in the supermarket of my family.

511
00:35:28,932 --> 00:35:31,371
In the supermarket of your family?
Were you having a blind date there?

512
00:35:31,371 --> 00:35:33,211
No, it was a coincidence.

513
00:35:33,211 --> 00:35:37,251
A coincidence?
That's too much of a coincidence.

514
00:35:37,251 --> 00:35:39,972
I also find it incredible.

515
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:43,501
Doudou, Mr. Mo said
he's finished recording.

516
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:44,291
You can come in.

517
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:47,892
So fast? He is getting quicker.

518
00:35:49,371 --> 00:35:50,211
Come. This way.

519
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:56,251
Mao, play it again.

520
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:56,492
Again?

521
00:35:56,492 --> 00:35:57,691
How is it?

522
00:35:57,691 --> 00:36:00,452
I have an iron flute of south

523
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:02,892
that wants to lean
on a fragrant, snowy twig.

524
00:36:02,892 --> 00:36:05,171
Blowing through the jade dawn,

525
00:36:05,171 --> 00:36:07,211
its clear shadow is hard to catch

526
00:36:08,691 --> 00:36:12,171
in the fluff flying across the sky.

527
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:12,691
This one is good.

528
00:36:12,691 --> 00:36:16,331
Drifting away, I and you
paddle on the cloud.

529
00:36:16,331 --> 00:36:17,612
Play it again, Mao.

530
00:36:17,612 --> 00:36:18,972
Again?

531
00:36:18,972 --> 00:36:20,892
I have an iron flute of south

532
00:36:21,892 --> 00:36:24,492
that wants to lean
on a fragrant, snowy twig.

533
00:36:24,492 --> 00:36:26,851
Blowing through the jade dawn,

534
00:36:28,612 --> 00:36:30,771
its clear shadow is hard to catch...

535
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:31,691
This one is also acceptable.

536
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:34,052
... in the fluff flying across the sky.

537
00:36:35,731 --> 00:36:38,211
Drifting away, I and you...

538
00:36:38,211 --> 00:36:40,412
I think the last two versions
are both good.

539
00:36:40,412 --> 00:36:42,132
... paddle on the cloud.

540
00:36:43,211 --> 00:36:44,691
I prefer the second one.

541
00:36:45,892 --> 00:36:46,452
Sheng.

542
00:36:48,132 --> 00:36:49,052
Which one do you prefer?

543
00:36:58,972 --> 00:37:01,731
I like them both. They are both good.

544
00:37:04,452 --> 00:37:05,132
Can't make a choice?

545
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:07,691
No, I can't.

546
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,851
Basically, to young girls,

547
00:37:10,851 --> 00:37:13,052
100 versions of you are equally good.

548
00:37:13,052 --> 00:37:17,132
Don't you have confidence
in your own voice?

549
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,052
Then let me think about it again.

550
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,371
Mao, play it two more times.

551
00:37:25,371 --> 00:37:26,811
Two more times? Alright.

552
00:37:28,851 --> 00:37:31,572
I have an iron flute of south

553
00:37:31,572 --> 00:37:34,251
that wants to lean
on a fragrant, snowy twig.

554
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:36,412
Blowing through the jade dawn,

555
00:37:36,412 --> 00:37:38,052
its clear shadow is hard to catch...

556
00:37:38,052 --> 00:37:39,972
Shengshengman, isn't it strange?

557
00:37:39,972 --> 00:37:41,331
... in the fluff flying across the sky.

558
00:37:41,331 --> 00:37:42,576
I mean the way he eats.

559
00:37:43,771 --> 00:37:46,651
Drifting away, I and you

560
00:37:46,651 --> 00:37:48,371
paddle on the cloud.

561
00:37:48,371 --> 00:37:51,291
He really cherishes
his thumb and index finger.

562
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:54,000
Because of work, he has eaten chips
like this since he was in school.

563
00:37:56,052 --> 00:37:57,092
She believed?

564
00:37:57,092 --> 00:37:58,171
Just kidding.

565
00:37:58,171 --> 00:38:00,976
We've said it one hundred times
and he still won't change his bad habit.

566
00:38:03,892 --> 00:38:05,171
I can do this too. I'll show you.

567
00:38:06,211 --> 00:38:07,412
Seriously?

568
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:08,211
Hold it like this.

569
00:38:10,572 --> 00:38:13,371
Never mind.
Let's think about what to eat tonight.

570
00:38:13,371 --> 00:38:15,972
Leave this part
for the post-production period.

571
00:38:15,972 --> 00:38:17,892
Leaving it to post-production
means leaving it to me, right?

572
00:38:17,892 --> 00:38:20,016
Great. I'm already hungry.

573
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:22,291
Oh no, I'm hungry too.

574
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:23,251
Wait a bit.

575
00:38:23,251 --> 00:38:24,251
Just wait a moment.

576
00:38:24,251 --> 00:38:25,932
Let's sit for a while.

577
00:38:25,932 --> 00:38:26,612
Sit for a while.

578
00:38:26,612 --> 00:38:27,572
What's going on?

579
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:28,092
Come on.

580
00:38:29,211 --> 00:38:30,612
I have a proposal.

581
00:38:30,612 --> 00:38:34,651
How about we have some memento
before we leave?

582
00:38:34,651 --> 00:38:36,932
What kind of memento?
You must be up to no good.

583
00:38:36,932 --> 00:38:40,331
Look, Sheng loves
Mr. Mo's voice the most.

584
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:41,731
We can all see that.

585
00:38:41,731 --> 00:38:44,651
Mr. Mo also said that
he loves Sheng's voice the most.

586
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:46,612
Now that we're here
in the recording studio,

587
00:38:46,612 --> 00:38:50,251
why not take this rare opportunity
to record a few more songs as a memento?

588
00:38:50,251 --> 00:38:53,584
In my opinion,
since you love each other so much

589
00:38:56,012 --> 00:38:56,691
in terms of voice,

590
00:38:57,892 --> 00:38:59,851
why not collaborate on a song right now?

591
00:39:00,892 --> 00:39:01,612
How about that?

592
00:39:01,612 --> 00:39:03,092
It's not a bad idea.

593
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:03,932
I agree.

594
00:39:03,932 --> 00:39:04,731
I second that.

595
00:39:07,492 --> 00:39:08,331
That sounds good.

596
00:39:09,771 --> 00:39:11,572
Come on. Mr. Mo, you understand me.

597
00:39:13,132 --> 00:39:16,412
Consider it a Valentine's Day gift
for the fans.

598
00:39:16,412 --> 00:39:18,132
Yes, it's almost Valentine's Day.

599
00:39:18,132 --> 00:39:19,532
It's right after the New Year.

600
00:39:19,532 --> 00:39:21,452
Good days just keep coming.

601
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:25,291
How about

602
00:39:28,012 --> 00:39:30,171
Return with You?

603
00:39:32,211 --> 00:39:33,251
This song...

604
00:39:34,492 --> 00:39:36,331
I thought
it was only their second meeting.

605
00:39:36,331 --> 00:39:37,572
Return with You already?

606
00:39:37,572 --> 00:39:39,371
That's too high-profile.

607
00:39:39,371 --> 00:39:41,651
He's never been in a relationship.
He wants to skip straight to the end.

608
00:39:41,651 --> 00:39:44,052
He's being overly anxious.

609
00:39:47,811 --> 00:39:49,532
You two go on.

610
00:39:52,171 --> 00:39:55,371
I don't sing very often.
I'm familiar with this one only.

611
00:39:55,371 --> 00:39:57,572
I'm also quite familiar with it.

612
00:39:59,331 --> 00:40:01,851
Is this song composed by you?

613
00:40:01,851 --> 00:40:02,651
Yes.

614
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:04,331
This song is quite popular, isn't it?

615
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:05,731
I remember since I was young...

616
00:40:05,731 --> 00:40:06,651
You...

617
00:40:06,651 --> 00:40:08,811
No, I've really listened to it
many times.

618
00:40:08,811 --> 00:40:11,412
In the past, when I listened to it,
I only noticed who sang it.

619
00:40:11,412 --> 00:40:12,851
I didn't pay attention
to the composition.

620
00:40:14,691 --> 00:40:15,412
Then let's sing it.

621
00:40:17,572 --> 00:40:18,532
Okay.

622
00:40:28,892 --> 00:40:30,251
You use this.

623
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:31,132
Okay, thank you.

624
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:33,331
Come closer. Let me see the height.

625
00:40:38,572 --> 00:40:40,572
Here, the lyrics.

626
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:41,612
Thank you.

627
00:40:45,211 --> 00:40:46,132
Look at him.

628
00:40:52,012 --> 00:40:53,731
Do you need to review the lyrics?

629
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:58,171
I'm not very familiar with the lyrics.

630
00:40:58,171 --> 00:41:01,731
I might need to practice
with the instrumental version once.

631
00:41:01,731 --> 00:41:03,211
How do you want to perform the duet?

632
00:41:04,731 --> 00:41:05,731
The key is quite high.

633
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:10,771
I think you should sing part A1.

634
00:41:10,771 --> 00:41:12,656
(Return with You)
And then I'll sing part A2.

635
00:41:12,656 --> 00:41:15,691
In section B, we take turns.

636
00:41:18,811 --> 00:41:22,251
As for chorus,
we harmonize with each other.

637
00:41:23,371 --> 00:41:24,932
In fact, I haven't figured it out yet.

638
00:41:24,932 --> 00:41:28,932
Why don't we feel it first
with the accompaniment?

639
00:41:28,932 --> 00:41:32,691
Okay. This song is quite high-pitched.

640
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:37,132
When I wrote it, I thought
it was more suitable for a female voice.

641
00:41:38,251 --> 00:41:39,532
Can you handle the chorus?

642
00:41:41,412 --> 00:41:41,932
No problem.

643
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:46,932
He's totally ignoring us.

644
00:41:46,932 --> 00:41:47,932
How considerate.

645
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:51,371
How's it? Ready? Let's get started.

646
00:41:51,371 --> 00:41:52,432
No, Mao.

647
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:56,052
We need to familiarize ourselves
with the lyrics. Play the accompaniment.

648
00:41:57,291 --> 00:41:58,052
Okay.

649
00:42:14,851 --> 00:42:16,171
I'm ready, Mr. Qiang Qingci.

650
00:42:18,811 --> 00:42:22,160
You can call me Qiang Qingci
or Mo Qingcheng.

651
00:42:23,251 --> 00:42:24,851
You don't need to call me "Mr".

652
00:42:24,851 --> 00:42:28,371
You can call him Qingcheng or Qingci.

653
00:42:29,691 --> 00:42:32,052
Sheng, call him Mo Qingcheng.

654
00:42:32,052 --> 00:42:33,492
Qiang Qingci sounds a little unfamiliar.

655
00:42:33,492 --> 00:42:35,184
I agree. Mo Qingcheng is fine.

656
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,731
If you want to become friends
in real life,

657
00:42:38,731 --> 00:42:40,572
it's better to call him Mo Qingcheng.

658
00:42:42,132 --> 00:42:43,932
It doesn't matter.

659
00:42:43,932 --> 00:42:45,291
I just don't want you
to feel constrained.

660
00:42:50,452 --> 00:42:51,972
Mo Qingcheng.

661
00:42:53,012 --> 00:42:55,811
See? It sounds much better.

662
00:42:55,811 --> 00:42:57,291
Can I call you that?

663
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:58,532
Of course.

664
00:43:00,052 --> 00:43:00,771
Are you ready?

665
00:43:02,132 --> 00:43:04,731
Let's find the right feeling first,
then officially start recording.

666
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:07,851
Keep the energy for the end.

667
00:43:09,492 --> 00:43:10,331
Mao.

668
00:43:11,972 --> 00:43:12,892
Yes?

669
00:43:12,892 --> 00:43:16,336
Let's start from section B.

670
00:43:16,336 --> 00:43:16,932
Okay.

671
00:43:16,932 --> 00:43:17,731
Section B.

672
00:43:17,731 --> 00:43:18,251
Okay.

673
00:43:18,251 --> 00:43:20,171
Let's first try the chorus.

674
00:43:20,171 --> 00:43:21,571
I'll familiarize myself with the lyrics.
