(Whether I'm Qiang Qingci
or Mo Qingcheng, I'm serious.)

26
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:47,099
Sheng.

27
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:54,659
He didn't lie to you.
He's really busy with his work.

28
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,060
Then I better eat a bit more.

29
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,260
Otherwise, I don't know
when the next meal with you will be.

30
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:01,819
Next time… Let me think.

31
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,099
How about two weeks from now?

32
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,620
- Really?
- Really?

33
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:07,900
If I don't work overtime.

34
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,060
Then it's a deal.

35
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:09,740
I'll wait for you.

36
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:13,460
Try this.

37
00:02:17,859 --> 00:02:19,580
Is the rain outside getting heavier?

38
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,379
Yes. It's really pouring out there.

39
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:24,500
You can't go back now, right?

40
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,780
Let's think about what to eat
for the late-night snack.

41
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:30,580
No way. I have the early shift tomorrow.

42
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:31,859
I have to go back tonight.

43
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,939
The early shift?

44
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,780
But I can stay a bit longer.

45
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,419
What do you want to eat?

46
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,180
Can I say it?

47
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,740
Stop joking.

48
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,139
It's pouring outside.
Grocery shopping is impossible for now.

49
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,900
Wouldn't that be too much trouble?

50
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,300
Would it?

51
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:52,419
How about
I make some Yangzhou fried rice later?

52
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,819
- I'll make a bit more.
- That's great!

53
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,740
Can I take some with me?

54
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,460
Sure, as long
as there are enough ingredients.

55
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:00,780
Yangzhou fried rice is my favorite.

56
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:01,859
I'm cooking the rice now.

57
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:02,419
Just eat first.

58
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:03,060
I'll help you.

59
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,259
You don't know where the rice is.

60
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:05,580
The food will be cold.

61
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,500
Right.

62
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,699
Go ahead and eat.

63
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,539
Thank you.

64
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:18,099
What for?

65
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,859
For being responsive to them.

66
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,220
Aren't they all your friends?
It's just a small favor.

67
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,500
Seeing them eat so happily

68
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,379
makes me happy too.

69
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,099
Let's play Truth or Dare tonight.

70
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,379
We'll draw cards to determine the order.

71
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:46,979
The one who draws the largest card
is the loser,

72
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:49,060
and we can ask him questions.
How about that?

73
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,419
- Okay.
- Good idea.

74
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:54,340
- Let's do it.
- Let's start with Mr. Mo.

75
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,139
- Okay.
- Sheng.

76
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:03,859
Wait a moment.

77
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,979
As the person in charge of the studio,
I'd like to say something.

78
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:08,900
It's raining heavily outside today,

79
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:10,780
so we can't play Dare.

80
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:14,259
We have to play Truth only.

81
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:15,139
- Truth.
- Okay.

82
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:16,900
We'll show our cards together
when I count to one.

83
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,460
Three, two, one.

84
00:04:23,499 --> 00:04:27,059
Which one of you pursued the other?

85
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,739
I pursued her.

86
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:36,419
Alright, the second round.

87
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,140
Three, two, one.

88
00:04:45,739 --> 00:04:47,659
Sheng got the largest card. I'll ask.

89
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:51,780
Which one of you likes the other more?

90
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,580
Hey, no cheating.

91
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:02,419
I didn't speak just now.

92
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,700
Okay, I'll let you pass. Next round.

93
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,419
Three, two, one.

94
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,820
Me?

95
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:20,220
Where did you first meet?

96
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:22,659
The supermarket.

97
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,099
I see.

98
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,659
- Let's do it again.
- Come on.

99
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,140
Three, two, one.

100
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,299
Sheng has the largest card.

101
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:37,140
Wait. Why do we
always get the largest cards?

102
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:38,299
Are you guys cheating?

103
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:40,859
You have to admit defeat, Shengshengman.

104
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:41,700
- Right.
- Right.

105
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,059
I'll shuffle.

106
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:47,739
It won't be me.

107
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:49,580
- Okay.
- Come on.

108
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,220
Look at you!

109
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,580
- Did you fall for Sheng at first sight?
- Yes.

110
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,900
- I knew it!
- I knew it!

111
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,380
Now it's Sheng's turn.

112
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,260
Did you ever kiss?

113
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:07,460
Of course not.

114
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:07,979
Three.

115
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:12,260
When do you plan to kiss her?
Have you thought about it?

116
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,179
Even secretly?

117
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,260
Tell us.

118
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,380
Go easy on her,
and let's play Dare for this round.

119
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:20,499
No way.

120
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:21,059
No.

121
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,099
Alright, let them do that.

122
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:24,739
Mr. Mo is our guest after all.

123
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,260
No, I need to get an answer.

124
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,580
- Think about the Yangzhou fried rice.
- Okay.

125
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,700
You can do that.

126
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,659
Okay, then. Can you sing?

127
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,220
Since you're here,
you might as well sing a song.

128
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,460
I'm just average at singing.

129
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:39,780
- That's okay.
- That's okay.

130
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:41,099
We are not picky listeners.

131
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,419
And you are not a singer.

132
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:44,140
Right, just pick any song.

133
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,859
I'll play the guitar.

134
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,179
I'll join you.

135
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,659
No need. I'll do it myself.

136
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:50,659
Okay.

137
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:51,260
Okay.

138
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:59,099
But I don't play very well.

139
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,140
Just bear with my playing.

140
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:03,020

They remind me of the dubbing team
I used to be part of.

154
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,499
Feng Yasong came from a poor family.

155
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,899
When we first started working
at the hospital,

156
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:46,700
he wouldn't eat at the cafeteria.

157
00:08:47,979 --> 00:08:50,820
Later, I would often make extra food
for him to take.

158
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,820
Then he was really fortunate.

159
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,499
This rain is heavier.

160
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,060
There are only two umbrellas.

161
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:25,300
How about you use mine?

162
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,940
It's a bit cute, if you don't mind.

163
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,220
It's okay.

164
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:35,859
Then I'll go ahead.

165
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,099
What's your relationship now?

166
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:41,619
You even won't share an umbrella.

167
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,859
We just started.

168
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:48,619
Just started?

169
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,420
You're finally admitting it.

170
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,859
There's nothing to deny.

171
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:53,580
There is.

172
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,060
He's being quite obvious toward you.

173
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,099
And you're being elusive toward him.

174
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,099
That's understandable.
You are shy in front of us, right?

175
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,820
Better hurry.
Don't you need to catch the last bus?

176
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:03,739
Let's go.

177
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,540
Watch your step.

178
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:26,979
You guys chat. I'll wait over here.

179
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:31,664
(Jiaodong University Station)

180
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:36,060
Thank you for escorting me
back to school

181
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,619
and for cooking for us.

182
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,499
Isn't that a bit too formal?

183
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:44,820
I mean, you shouldn't thank me,
given our relationship.

184
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,300
Why not tell them who I am?

185
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,420
You don't show up in front of people.

186
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:03,779
I thought you wouldn't enjoy that.

187
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,739
But they're your friends.
It's different.

188
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:13,940
But...

189
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,220
But what?

190
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:24,460
What if we don't end up together?

191
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,940
It's not good
to let others know who you are.

192
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:33,180
Why are you laughing?

193
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:39,099
What have I done today
to upset you so much?

194
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,379
Not at all.

195
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,259
Then why are you contemplating a breakup

196
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,060
before I left?

197
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:56,460
I said that casually.

198
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,340
I am rational.

199
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,820
Then let me say it again.

200
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,180
I am serious.

201
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:19,220

202
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,739
or Mo Qingcheng,

203
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,859
I am serious.

I don't know what to say.

208
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:56,779
I've thought about it for a long time
and still don't know.

209
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,700
I just feel like I'm dreaming.

210
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,859
I'm not used to this.
I have no experience.

211
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,180
What I said earlier
was just a hypothetical one.

212
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,540
Because you have many fans.

213
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:22,700
From your perspective, the fewer
people who know it, the better.

214
00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:26,700
I am also serious.

215
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,499
I know.

216
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,499
The last train is coming.
You should go quickly.

217
00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:44,739
It's hard to get a taxi here
when it's raining.

218
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:47,660
Remember to send me a message.

219
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,420
If I can't reply in time,

220
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,940
it means I'm in the operating room.

221
00:13:55,619 --> 00:13:57,899
Or I'm in the outpatient clinic
or doing rounds.

222
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:00,499
I'll reply when I see it.

223
00:14:05,814 --> 00:14:08,255
Keep it.
My friend and I can share an umbrella.

224
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,574
There's a convenience store
at my destination.

225
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:11,974
I'll buy another one then.

226
00:14:12,415 --> 00:14:13,375
With such heavy rain,

227
00:14:13,574 --> 00:14:15,854
it's easy for both of you
to get wet by sharing an umbrella.

228
00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:18,535
Okay then.

229
00:14:20,854 --> 00:14:22,614
Don't keep your friend waiting. Just go.

230
00:14:24,015 --> 00:14:27,334
- I'll go after you leave.
- Okay.

00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,854
I was worried
he would miss the last train.

238
00:15:00,055 --> 00:15:01,135
Qiang Qingci lost.

239
00:15:03,055 --> 00:15:05,375
I said Qiang Qingci lost.

240
00:15:06,015 --> 00:15:08,495
You obviously like Mr. Mo more.

241
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:11,015
Maybe.

Let's go. Hurry up.

244
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:23,655
Okay.

245
00:15:32,094 --> 00:15:34,214
Our school environment is pretty, right?

246
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:37,214
Aren't you going to compliment it
after the tour?

247
00:15:39,854 --> 00:15:40,464
It is pretty.

248
00:15:49,495 --> 00:15:50,655
(Isn't he leaving?)

249
00:15:53,015 --> 00:15:54,415
Well, it's raining heavily.

250
00:15:55,295 --> 00:15:58,974
I'm afraid you might get wet
if I let you go now.

251
00:16:00,814 --> 00:16:04,015
Well, let's stay a little longer then.

252
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:06,775
Okay. I have nothing else to do anyway.

253
00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:17,934
What do you do for a living?

254
00:16:18,135 --> 00:16:21,255
You seem fairly free, being able
to stay around my school for a day.

255
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:25,734
I run my own company,
and I have pretty flexible time.

256
00:16:32,094 --> 00:16:32,375
What?

257
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:36,694
Nothing.

258
00:16:37,734 --> 00:16:40,334
It's the first time I've met someone

259
00:16:41,015 --> 00:16:43,094
who compliments himself
for being capable.

260
00:16:44,694 --> 00:16:47,015
I'm actually not that capable.

261
00:16:47,295 --> 00:16:50,334
My company is not large,
and my annual income is enough to spend.

262
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:57,734
It's also the first time
I've met someone who is not modest.

263
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:16,334
Are you thinking of leaving?

264
00:17:16,455 --> 00:17:17,055
No.

265
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:22,094
I noticed you've been
tapping the steering wheel.

266
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:25,015
Usually, when I'm impatient,
I like to do the same thing.

267
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:27,094
No, I am wondering

268
00:17:28,455 --> 00:17:30,055
if you are usually very busy.

269
00:17:31,174 --> 00:17:33,174
Sometimes, I want to message you.

270
00:17:33,495 --> 00:17:36,255
But I feel a bit shy,

271
00:17:36,775 --> 00:17:38,455
being afraid of disturbing you.

272
00:17:39,134 --> 00:17:42,134
I'm not busy.
You can contact me anytime.

273
00:17:42,374 --> 00:17:42,935
Really?

274
00:17:45,495 --> 00:17:49,894
Okay. I'm usually free as well.

275
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:54,495
Except sometimes
when I'm in the recording studio.

276
00:17:54,614 --> 00:17:55,854
I'm not busy at any other time.

277
00:17:57,134 --> 00:17:59,334
Okay, let's stay in touch.

278
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:00,935
Okay.

279
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:10,055
Sheng is back.

280
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:11,535
Well, goodbye then.

281
00:18:17,814 --> 00:18:19,295

282
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:22,814
Where is your umbrella?

283
00:18:22,975 --> 00:18:23,535
I forgot.

284
00:18:24,455 --> 00:18:26,174

Thank you.

What are you doing?

291
00:18:56,295 --> 00:18:58,015
I want to see what he looks like.

292
00:18:58,775 --> 00:18:59,614
I'm sorry.

293
00:18:59,695 --> 00:19:00,215
It's alrighty.

294
00:19:00,255 --> 00:19:01,134
She is naughty.

Hey, let me tell you a secret.

296
00:19:03,574 --> 00:19:05,334
All doctors look alike.

297
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:06,854
Only their eyes differ.

298
00:19:08,374 --> 00:19:09,574
Next time you come to the hospital

299
00:19:09,854 --> 00:19:10,935
and see someone like me

300
00:19:11,055 --> 00:19:12,735
who covers everything but their eyes

301
00:19:13,295 --> 00:19:14,854
and wears a nameplate like this
on their chest,

302
00:19:15,695 --> 00:19:18,094
that's someone who can treat you,
got it?

303
00:19:20,455 --> 00:19:23,094
Doctor, please look at my child first.

304
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:24,775
He suddenly fainted.
I don't know what happened.

305
00:19:24,775 --> 00:19:25,414
- Come in.
- Okay.

306
00:19:25,574 --> 00:19:27,535
What's happening?

307
00:19:29,854 --> 00:19:31,174
I've been waiting in line.

308
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:32,455
How could you let him in first

309
00:19:32,535 --> 00:19:34,255
without even asking me?

310
00:19:34,334 --> 00:19:35,215
It's urgent.

311
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,094
Didn't you see
the child was unconscious?

312
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:39,215
Is their time more valuable

313
00:19:39,334 --> 00:19:40,414
than mine?

314
00:19:41,134 --> 00:19:42,975
We should all follow the rules
and wait our turn.

315
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:44,015
I am really sorry.

What's going on?

321
00:19:51,255 --> 00:19:52,695
Can't you let them save the child first?

322
00:19:53,894 --> 00:19:55,094
What department are you in?

323
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:57,055
Is this your business to meddle in?

324
00:19:58,455 --> 00:20:01,015
Life matters most. Being unconscious
could be life-threatening.

325
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,255
Alright.

326
00:20:03,374 --> 00:20:05,414
- That child is in danger.
- Let go.

Let them see the doctor first.

329
00:20:08,134 --> 00:20:10,775
- Mother, stay away.
- Right. Aren't we all waiting?

330
00:20:10,894 --> 00:20:12,094
They went in because it was urgent.

337
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,574

340
00:20:29,455 --> 00:20:30,832

- Then I'll get back to work.
- Okay.

to let me see if it's real.

Yes.

363
00:22:33,094 --> 00:22:33,935
Impressive.

00:22:35,614 --> 00:22:36,814
We were just talking about you.

365
00:22:37,295 --> 00:22:40,614
I heard you did a good deed
in pediatrics today.

366
00:22:40,894 --> 00:22:41,735
Are you okay?

367
00:22:42,814 --> 00:22:43,695
I'm fine.

368
00:22:43,735 --> 00:22:45,735
Pediatrics is full of worrying parents.

369
00:22:45,854 --> 00:22:48,374
It's easy for a couple of them
to get anxious.

370
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:51,574
I've heard their department hasn't
filled all their positions this year.

371
00:22:51,894 --> 00:22:53,134
There will be fewer doctors later.

372
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,094
Eventually,
when there are no pediatricians,

373
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:56,574
everyone will know
how precious they are.

374
00:22:57,814 --> 00:22:58,814
It's tough for everyone.

375
00:22:59,535 --> 00:23:01,255
You haven't eaten, right?

376
00:23:01,695 --> 00:23:03,814
While you are not busy,
you should eat now.

377
00:23:04,094 --> 00:23:04,735
Good idea.

378
00:23:06,015 --> 00:23:07,935
No need. I brought you food.

379
00:23:08,495 --> 00:23:09,894
I've heated it up. Go ahead and eat it.

380
00:23:12,775 --> 00:23:14,614
Then you eat. I'm going back to work.

381
00:23:14,854 --> 00:23:15,775
Dr. Mo, I'm leaving.

382
00:23:19,695 --> 00:23:22,894
All the hunger I've suffered
is worth it when I can eat

383
00:23:23,015 --> 00:23:23,894
what you cook.

384
00:23:26,414 --> 00:23:28,334
By the way,
help me look at this medical record.

385
00:23:28,495 --> 00:23:29,255
Meanwhile, I'll eat.

386
00:23:33,015 --> 00:23:33,654
What's wrong?

387
00:23:34,935 --> 00:23:37,614
Nothing, maybe I got a cold.

388
00:23:38,094 --> 00:23:39,854
Got a cold?

389
00:23:39,975 --> 00:23:41,935
I'll find you some medicine.

390
00:23:42,134 --> 00:23:45,735
As a doctor, don't you know
how important your health is?

391
00:23:46,015 --> 00:23:47,174
I'll brew a packet for you.

392
00:23:48,174 --> 00:23:49,495
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

393
00:23:50,632 --> 00:23:53,968
(Jiayuan)

394
00:24:12,735 --> 00:24:14,535
- What are you doing?
- Let's talk.

395
00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:19,894
You talk, and I'll listen.

396
00:24:20,814 --> 00:24:22,735
I don't see you often in this place.

397
00:24:23,174 --> 00:24:25,695
We are almost becoming strangers.

398
00:24:26,735 --> 00:24:28,614
You talk, and I'll listen.

399
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:30,614
Alright.

400
00:24:33,094 --> 00:24:35,814
How many times did you
meet Shengshengman

401
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,232
before you started pursuing her?

402
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:38,255
Wasn't it too impulsive?

403
00:24:40,574 --> 00:24:41,975
I think when it comes to love,

404
00:24:42,295 --> 00:24:44,455
you need to slow down
to get to know her.

405
00:24:45,535 --> 00:24:46,055
Well,

406
00:24:46,894 --> 00:24:48,975
you need to know her perspective, right?

407
00:24:49,935 --> 00:24:51,535
For example, her views on love,

408
00:24:51,735 --> 00:24:52,814
her values,

409
00:24:52,814 --> 00:24:53,935
and her outlook on life.

410
00:24:54,215 --> 00:24:55,255
You have to know all of these.

411
00:24:55,935 --> 00:24:58,814
And you also need to know
her attitude towards her parents,

412
00:24:59,015 --> 00:25:00,215
towards kids,

413
00:25:00,854 --> 00:25:02,015
and towards small animals.

414
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:04,535
You can't be too impulsive, right?

415
00:25:04,695 --> 00:25:06,574
You not only need to know what she likes

416
00:25:06,574 --> 00:25:08,614
but also what she dislikes.

417
00:25:08,894 --> 00:25:11,134
You have to know
whether she doesn't like

418
00:25:13,015 --> 00:25:14,455
those who are too muscular,

419
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:19,055
or men with small eyes,

420
00:25:19,775 --> 00:25:23,894
or men who are too old, right?

421
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:25,374
Do you have someone in mind?

422
00:25:27,174 --> 00:25:27,854
No.

423
00:25:27,975 --> 00:25:28,775
I don't.

424
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:29,854
Aren't we talking about you?

425
00:25:36,015 --> 00:25:38,574
If you're unsure,
I suggest you wait until another day.

426
00:25:38,775 --> 00:25:39,854
No, let's talk today.

427
00:25:39,975 --> 00:25:42,614
Just a bit more.

428
00:25:43,055 --> 00:25:44,215
Don't sleep. It's still early.

429
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:33,654
Come on. Let's talk.

430
00:26:35,574 --> 00:26:36,215
About perspectives.

431
00:26:36,854 --> 00:26:37,695
No. Just sleep.

432
00:26:37,735 --> 00:26:38,935
No more talking.

433
00:26:47,574 --> 00:26:49,094
Get up.

434
00:26:49,094 --> 00:26:51,334
(Girl's Dorm Building 3)
My boyfriend is treating you to snacks.

435
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:52,614
Here you are.

436
00:26:53,174 --> 00:26:53,814
So many.

437
00:26:55,295 --> 00:26:57,894
Sheng, here you are.

438
00:26:58,134 --> 00:26:59,414
Thank you.

439
00:27:00,455 --> 00:27:01,695
You and your boyfriend

440
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:04,334
make me believe
that love is still worth believing in.

441
00:27:04,495 --> 00:27:05,894
Do you want to be in love too?

442
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:07,894
Why don't you hurry up
and find a boyfriend?

443
00:27:08,134 --> 00:27:10,295
(Heading to the hospital. See you.)
Love can bring joy.

444
00:27:10,814 --> 00:27:12,094
(He should get off work now.)

445
00:27:12,535 --> 00:27:14,215
(Why hasn't he sent me any messages?)

446
00:27:40,495 --> 00:27:41,215
Wake up.

447
00:27:42,414 --> 00:27:43,174
It's ten AM.

448
00:27:43,894 --> 00:27:44,495
Get up now.

449
00:27:46,854 --> 00:27:48,134
Pour me a glass of hot water, please.

450
00:27:49,094 --> 00:27:49,695
What's wrong?

451
00:27:51,055 --> 00:27:52,094
I'm feeling a bit unwell.

452
00:27:54,535 --> 00:27:55,414
You got a cold?

453
00:27:55,535 --> 00:27:57,174
Why didn't you
cover yourself with a quilt?

454
00:27:57,854 --> 00:27:59,174
Next time, just sleep in your own room.

455
00:27:59,255 --> 00:28:00,495
Then I can cover myself with a quilt.

456
00:28:12,735 --> 00:28:13,495
The water is here.

457
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:14,535
Thanks.

458
00:28:18,134 --> 00:28:20,495
You seem to have a fever.
Shall I take you to the hospital?

459
00:28:21,695 --> 00:28:22,735
I'll just lie down for a bit.

460
00:28:23,455 --> 00:28:25,654
I'm off work today.
I've taken sick leave.

461
00:28:27,094 --> 00:28:28,334
If it gets worse,

462
00:28:28,654 --> 00:28:30,384
I'll get checked
when I go to work tomorrow.

463
00:28:32,854 --> 00:28:33,455
Alright.

464
00:28:34,015 --> 00:28:34,854
Drink the water.

465
00:28:34,975 --> 00:28:36,455
- Do you have any medicine?
- Yes.

466
00:28:37,094 --> 00:28:38,614
I'll read the script.
Call me if you need me.

467
00:28:39,854 --> 00:28:40,775
Keep warm.

468
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:49,520
(Heading to the hospital. See you.)

469
00:28:53,174 --> 00:28:54,334
What are you thinking about?

470
00:28:58,455 --> 00:28:59,455
Look at her.

471
00:28:59,574 --> 00:29:01,854
Ever since she was with my idol,

472
00:29:02,255 --> 00:29:03,654
there has been nothing else on her mind,

473
00:29:03,854 --> 00:29:06,854
but the image of that man.

474
00:29:07,174 --> 00:29:09,055
- One mustn't get lost in love.
- You will lose yourself.

475
00:29:09,055 --> 00:29:10,215
It's dangerous.

476
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:10,935
Gu Sheng.

477
00:29:10,935 --> 00:29:13,894
I'm just worried
he's oversleeping from working late.

478
00:29:14,174 --> 00:29:15,854
I wonder if it's good
to send a message now.

479
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,055
I'll stop staring at my phone, okay?

480
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,215
No. What if your boyfriend
slips through your fingers?

481
00:29:23,215 --> 00:29:25,255
What a pity that would be.

482
00:29:26,215 --> 00:29:27,654
He's been pretty nice to you.

483
00:29:27,775 --> 00:29:28,535
That's right.

484
00:29:30,654 --> 00:29:32,055
What exactly do you want?

485
00:29:33,695 --> 00:29:36,255
Of course, I want you to be happy.

486
00:29:36,414 --> 00:29:37,574
Of course.

487
00:29:40,775 --> 00:29:41,574
Where are you going?

488
00:29:41,854 --> 00:29:43,455
To see Mr. Qiang?

489
00:29:43,455 --> 00:29:44,374
Highly likely.

490
00:29:45,374 --> 00:29:46,935
I'm going to the library.

491
00:29:47,094 --> 00:29:47,735
Have you forgotten?

492
00:29:47,735 --> 00:29:49,414
We promised to help the teacher
organize books.

493
00:29:50,654 --> 00:29:52,495
Right. Sheng, wait for me.

494
00:30:07,495 --> 00:30:08,215
Zhou Zheng?

495
00:30:11,094 --> 00:30:12,334
Z-Zhou Zheng?

496
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:35,015
These two books go over there as well.
Thank you.

497
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:45,535
By the way, Sheng,
how is your thesis coming along?

498
00:30:46,695 --> 00:30:48,975
It's almost done.
I just want to make some adjustments.

499
00:30:49,295 --> 00:30:50,854
But I haven't figured out
how to adjust it yet.

500
00:30:51,455 --> 00:30:52,695
Really?

501
00:30:53,094 --> 00:30:55,255
Our top student also has times
when she's stumped?

502
00:30:56,695 --> 00:30:57,255
Xiaoxing.

503
00:30:57,495 --> 00:30:59,295
Come help me decide
where to put this book.

504
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:01,055
Right, I forgot to tell you. Which one?

505
00:31:03,134 --> 00:31:04,374
I thought you weren't coming today.

506
00:31:05,574 --> 00:31:07,535
It was the task assigned by the teacher.
I would come.

507
00:31:08,775 --> 00:31:09,814
Are you stuck with your thesis?

508
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:15,055
If you have time,
maybe we can discuss it together.

509
00:31:15,775 --> 00:31:16,295
Sure.

510
00:31:16,654 --> 00:31:17,735
How about today?

511
00:31:20,894 --> 00:31:21,574
I'm free today.

512
00:31:21,574 --> 00:31:22,414
(Off Key)
(Are you okay?)

513
00:31:23,614 --> 00:31:25,894
I'll give you a message
when I've thought about it.

514
00:31:26,055 --> 00:31:27,735
Okay, I'll wait for your message.

515
00:31:27,814 --> 00:31:29,015
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

516
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,455
(Yes. What's wrong?)

517
00:31:34,854 --> 00:31:36,374
(I noticed
that you haven't posted on Weibo.)

518
00:31:36,614 --> 00:31:38,614
(I thought you were affected
by those posts.)

519
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,134
(Fame attracts criticism.)

520
00:31:41,455 --> 00:31:43,374
(Hang in there, Shengshengman.)

521
00:31:49,046 --> 00:31:50,735
(Comments)

522
00:31:50,735 --> 00:31:52,215
(From a professional perspective,)

523
00:31:52,215 --> 00:31:54,255
(Shengshengman's composition
is just average.)

524
00:31:54,735 --> 00:31:57,935
(I don't understand
why it is said she is talented.)

525
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:00,374
(I can't believe Qiang Qingci
is recommending her.)

526
00:32:00,654 --> 00:32:02,134
(What a bandwagon jumper!)

527
00:32:06,935 --> 00:32:08,614
Are you not feeling well?

528
00:32:09,935 --> 00:32:12,455
No, maybe I'm just hungry.

529
00:32:13,614 --> 00:32:14,654
Then let's go eat together.

530
00:32:16,695 --> 00:32:18,975
By the way, I saw the class leader
looking for you just now.

531
00:32:19,094 --> 00:32:19,814
Is something up?

532
00:32:21,695 --> 00:32:23,495
It's about the thesis.

533
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:26,814
Just the thesis?

534
00:32:27,814 --> 00:32:29,455
Let's go to eat.

535
00:32:29,975 --> 00:32:31,614
A full belly solves all worries.

536
00:32:31,775 --> 00:32:33,654
I want to have
minced pork and vermicelli casserole.

537
00:32:34,814 --> 00:32:35,495
Wait.

538
00:32:36,735 --> 00:32:39,414
You don't look right.

539
00:32:39,975 --> 00:32:41,215
Who upsets you?

540
00:32:41,695 --> 00:32:43,215
Tell me, and I'll stand up for you.

541
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:50,854
I just saw some unpleasant posts

542
00:32:51,414 --> 00:32:56,814
and got a bit affected emotionally.

543
00:32:58,015 --> 00:33:00,055
(Mo Qingcheng)
It's those online posts about you?

544
00:33:00,176 --> 00:33:01,414
- Sheng...
- Help me with this.

545
00:33:01,574 --> 00:33:02,695
I need to take this call.

546
00:33:02,735 --> 00:33:03,295
I...

547
00:33:03,854 --> 00:33:04,374
Hello?

548
00:33:08,495 --> 00:33:09,614
I just took a nap

549
00:33:10,854 --> 00:33:11,975
and haven't fully woken up yet.

550
00:33:12,814 --> 00:33:14,174
I'll sleep for another two hours

551
00:33:15,134 --> 00:33:16,334
before calling you, okay?

552
00:33:16,455 --> 00:33:17,935
Are you sick?

553
00:33:20,495 --> 00:33:22,935
I have a bit
of a sore throat and a fever.

554
00:33:23,695 --> 00:33:25,695
Did you take your temperature?

555
00:33:28,495 --> 00:33:29,134
Yes, I did.

556
00:33:29,695 --> 00:33:32,814
Then maybe you should
sleep a little more.

557
00:33:33,535 --> 00:33:36,574
- I'll call you when I wake up.
- Bye.

558
00:33:43,334 --> 00:33:43,854
Sheng,

559
00:33:44,654 --> 00:33:46,374
don't be upset
over things on the internet.

560
00:33:49,614 --> 00:33:51,975
It's not like that. I have to go now.

561
00:33:51,975 --> 00:33:53,374
I'm almost done here.
Go back when you finish.

562
00:33:53,374 --> 00:33:55,174
Wait. I... The books...

563
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,912
(Mo Qingcheng)

564
00:34:13,694 --> 00:34:15,415
(He should still be asleep.)

565
00:34:25,895 --> 00:34:29,455
What's wrong? Forgot your access card?

566
00:34:30,975 --> 00:34:33,055
My boyfriend is sleeping.

567
00:34:33,214 --> 00:34:34,614
I'm afraid calling him will wake him up.

568
00:34:35,415 --> 00:34:36,134
Come on in.

569
00:34:36,335 --> 00:34:36,935
Thank you.

570
00:34:37,134 --> 00:34:38,495
Madam, let me carry them for you.

571
00:34:39,174 --> 00:34:39,895
Thank you so much.

572
00:34:42,574 --> 00:34:43,294
Thank you.

573
00:34:43,535 --> 00:34:44,214
Thank you.

574
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:50,455
Which floor?

575
00:34:51,694 --> 00:34:52,734
The 16th floor as well.

576
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:55,335
What a coincidence!

577
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:58,094
Who is your boyfriend?

578
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:03,654
Is it Dr. Mo who doesn't like to talk?

579
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:06,774
Doctor is good. We've arrived.

580
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:11,015
Give them to me. I live right there.

581
00:35:11,174 --> 00:35:12,694
No worries. I can carry them for you.

582
00:35:12,935 --> 00:35:13,734
Thank you.

583
00:35:24,855 --> 00:35:25,552
Give them to me.

584
00:35:26,015 --> 00:35:27,174
Please take care.

585
00:35:28,134 --> 00:35:29,254
Go find Dr. Mo quickly.

586
00:35:29,734 --> 00:35:30,455
Thank you.

587
00:35:31,415 --> 00:35:31,935
Goodbye.

588
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:12,174
(I hope he's not delirious with fever.)

589
00:36:23,935 --> 00:36:24,815
Why did you come?

590
00:36:26,535 --> 00:36:27,455
Are you okay?

591
00:36:31,574 --> 00:36:32,254
Come in first.

592
00:36:38,455 --> 00:36:39,335
Here are the slippers.

593
00:36:39,855 --> 00:36:41,574
I'll go into the room first.
I'm not wearing much.

594
00:37:26,294 --> 00:37:28,935
Are you still feeling unwell?

595
00:37:29,574 --> 00:37:31,174
Do you want to go to the hospital?

596
00:37:38,174 --> 00:37:41,015
Lie down and rest for a bit.

597
00:37:41,734 --> 00:37:43,455
I'll get you some hot water in a moment.

598
00:37:49,055 --> 00:37:51,134
Aren't you cold in a skirt?

599
00:37:52,495 --> 00:37:54,895
It was quite warm
when I left in the morning.

600
00:37:55,055 --> 00:37:55,935
It's not cold for me.

601
00:37:56,495 --> 00:37:58,134
How about
I get you a pair of sports pants?

602
00:37:58,455 --> 00:37:59,855
There's a problem with the heating here.

603
00:38:01,214 --> 00:38:02,094
It's not very warm.

604
00:38:02,535 --> 00:38:04,855
Just lie down
and take a good rest first.

605
00:38:05,174 --> 00:38:07,734
You are the patient here.
Just ignore me.

606
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:44,055
Have you taken the medicine?

607
00:38:53,815 --> 00:38:55,055
Why is it still so hot?

608
00:39:07,654 --> 00:39:09,055
Why are your hands so cold?

609
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,855
I wanted to tell you last time.

610
00:39:17,415 --> 00:39:20,975
In winter,
you must wear skirts less often.

611
00:39:21,855 --> 00:39:23,184
It'll be better for your health.

612
00:39:24,574 --> 00:39:25,614
You must keep warm.

613
00:39:32,574 --> 00:39:35,774
What color is your towel?

614
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:39,495
Let me wet it and help you cool down.

615
00:39:40,535 --> 00:39:41,294
It's white.

616
00:40:45,553 --> 00:40:46,960
(38 degrees)

617
00:41:29,855 --> 00:41:33,134
Staying together in a room
can be contagious.

618
00:41:34,694 --> 00:41:35,574
Maybe

619
00:41:40,855 --> 00:41:42,174
you should go out and sit for a while.

620
00:41:45,415 --> 00:41:48,254
It's okay. I'll keep you company.

621
00:41:49,815 --> 00:41:50,535
Just go.

622
00:41:52,455 --> 00:41:53,855
I'm here to see you.

623
00:41:54,574 --> 00:41:56,694
I'm the doctor. Listen to me.

624
00:41:57,654 --> 00:42:01,094
Well, this towel...

625
00:42:05,134 --> 00:42:07,734
I will use it later.

626
00:43:08,716 --> 00:43:13,072
(A Lifetime in Jiangnan)

627
00:43:44,535 --> 00:43:45,895
No wonder I'm hungry.

628
00:44:12,774 --> 00:44:13,574
This is delicious too.

629
00:44:33,535 --> 00:44:34,375
