25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,376
(Do you miss me?)

26
00:01:43,632 --> 00:01:45,712
(Yes, I miss you a lot.)

27
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:01,699
What did you just ask me?

28
00:02:07,059 --> 00:02:10,859
Didn't you say you knew?

29
00:02:15,258 --> 00:02:15,899
I knew?

30
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:26,459
You mean the bus?

31
00:02:29,658 --> 00:02:31,859
There is no direct bus around here.

32
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:37,139
- We can only take the subway.
- Then why did you say you knew?

33
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:43,698
I wasn't paying attention
to what you were saying.

34
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:53,019
So the throat lozenge

35
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:57,299
was your plan all along.

36
00:03:01,818 --> 00:03:04,378
Let's go up?

37
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:08,658
- No.
- Why?

38
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:19,184
We just came down. If we go up now
without anything in our hands,

39
00:03:20,272 --> 00:03:23,498
they will start wondering where we went.

40
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:27,739
That's true.

41
00:03:30,698 --> 00:03:31,498
Then...

42
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:38,098
- How about I take you back to school?
- Okay. I will go up to get my backpack.

43
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:43,299
Wait here. I'll go get it.

44
00:04:03,538 --> 00:04:04,459
Wait for me here.

45
00:04:38,498 --> 00:04:39,458
What are you looking at?

46
00:05:03,378 --> 00:05:05,779
I have been busy
since we returned from Yangshuo.

47
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:08,739
I've really wanted to see you.

48
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,179
Only 'hmm'?

49
00:05:15,818 --> 00:05:19,159
I've also really wanted to see you.
If you didn't meet me at school today,

50
00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:21,776
I was thinking about helping out
at the store tomorrow for the weekend

51
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:23,138
so that I could see you.

52
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:39,719
Are you busy later?
If not, let's go to some other place.

53
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:44,099
I don't want to stand here holding hands
and being watched by others.

54
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,219
Where are we going?

55
00:05:49,258 --> 00:05:51,698
At this hour, there are many places
in our school that are not occupied.

56
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:56,859
Okay then. Let's stroll around.

57
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:10,299
Sheng? Sheng.

58
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,698
Is he...

59
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:17,659
Yes, he is.

60
00:06:24,378 --> 00:06:25,099
A classmate?

61
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:28,659
She is my roommate.
I told you about her.

62
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:30,659
Qi Yao?

63
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:37,458
I-I wanted to control myself, but...

64
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:40,219
I finally saw you in person.

65
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:45,299
- I'm your loyal fan.
- Thank you.

66
00:06:47,138 --> 00:06:49,839
If the class hadn't ended early,
I would have missed you guys.

67
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,679
Sheng has been very protective of you.
She wouldn't tell us anything.

68
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,479
She wouldn't even show us photos.

69
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:59,919
I don't mind at all. As your girlfriend,
she is definitely doing the right thing

70
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,898
to protect you.

71
00:07:02,578 --> 00:07:06,039
I'm too busy with work. Otherwise,
I would've treated all of you to a meal.

72
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:09,059
- You are all Sheng's classmates.
- That's really not necessary.

73
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:17,518
You two are going on a date, right?
Go ahead. A quick look is enough for me.

74
00:07:17,518 --> 00:07:24,578
- No, I'm just seeing him off.
- Now? It's early. You can't do that.

75
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:30,539
Our school has really beautiful scenery,
with many famous spots for dating.

76
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:34,299
Go over there.
The atmosphere is good. You know it.

77
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:41,419
- You know?
- No. I've never dated there.

78
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,059
I simply went there to take a look
when I was a freshman.

79
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:49,018
I can vouch for her. We went together.
It's a must-visit place for freshmen.

80
00:07:54,258 --> 00:07:57,619
My boyfriend is still waiting
for my call. You guys, carry on.

81
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:01,299
- Come by often.
- I will.

82
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:04,539
- Then we'll take our leave.
- Okay. Hurry.

83
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:06,539
See you next time.

84
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:07,818
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

85
00:08:24,258 --> 00:08:27,378
So, this is the unoccupied place
you were talking about?

86
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:32,539
It's just that the lights here
are quite bright.

87
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:41,419
Isn't it good? They prevent tripping
and can keep the bad guys away.

88
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:04,978
(He wouldn't want to kiss me here,
would he?)

89
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:07,139
I want to ask you a question.

90
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:15,458
What time does the dorm close?

91
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:21,818
It should be... Wait...

92
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:24,978
It seems...

93
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:31,978
It should definitely be 11 p.m.

94
00:09:35,499 --> 00:09:36,338
So, it's still early.

95
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:43,376
Let's walk some more.

96
00:09:58,576 --> 00:10:02,928
(Girl's Dorm Building 3)

97
00:10:10,098 --> 00:10:11,659
(No matter which part of me you like,)

98
00:10:12,818 --> 00:10:14,064
(it's all me, right?)

99
00:10:15,152 --> 00:10:16,698
(There's nothing wrong
with liking my voice.)

100
00:10:18,578 --> 00:10:19,578
(It's better than)

101
00:10:21,218 --> 00:10:23,059
(me not being attractive to you, right?)

102
00:10:55,458 --> 00:11:01,839
(When he opened his eyes, the red door
was open. No one was outside,)

103
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,779
(yet there lingered the bustling aura
of a vibrant morning.)

104
00:11:10,218 --> 00:11:14,419
(Deep in the blooming flowers,
his world is full of life.)

105
00:11:28,858 --> 00:11:31,819
- What's wrong? Are you okay?
- Are you sleepwalking?

106
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:38,499
Sheng, thank you.
I'm so excited that I still can't sleep.

107
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:42,658
That's enough.
You've been talking about it all night.

108
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:47,239
I understand you are a fan.
But please don't do this at midnight.

109
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:51,312
- I almost fell off the bed.
- Sorry if I woke you.

110
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:55,299
- Were you two asleep?
- No.

111
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:58,899
I couldn't fall asleep.

112
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:05,019
Something on your mind?

113
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:13,259
I just remembered that I haven't
finished my report on Yangshuo.

114
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:17,619
Sheng, how are the photos you took?
Mine aren't very good.

115
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:20,592
I was performing that day
and had no chance to take photos.

116
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:23,519
I only took a few
during the rehearsal and stage setup.

117
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,519
But I'm not a pro.
My photos are not very good.

118
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,599
There must have been a photographer
that day. Why don't you ask them?

119
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:33,978
Juemei hired a photographer
to do the whole shooting. Just ask him.

120
00:12:36,978 --> 00:12:41,168
We haven't been in touch since Yangshuo.
I don't think I should do that.

121
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:45,424
Weren't you getting close back then?
You played mahjong all night.

122
00:12:46,576 --> 00:12:51,319
You played mahjong with him all night?
Geng Xiaoxing, you're so lucky.

123
00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:55,098
There were also many other people.
I was just making up the numbers.

124
00:13:14,352 --> 00:13:16,880
(I heard you...)

125
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:27,419
Isn't this Qiang Qingci's drink?
Be careful. He will go after you.

126
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,379
- You can buy more for him tomorrow.
- Why me?

127
00:13:33,738 --> 00:13:34,578
It's a joint punishment.

128
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:36,779
You are out of your mind.

129
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,239
It's late. Who is it?

130
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:44,618
(I heard you brought a photographer
to Yangshuo. Do you have any photos?)

131
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,208
(Zhou Zheng)

132
00:13:53,338 --> 00:13:55,499
What's wrong? Who is calling you?

133
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:57,659
It's my mother.

134
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:08,938
- Hello?
- Hello, this is Juemei.

135
00:14:10,338 --> 00:14:13,398
I know.
We are voice-chatting on WeChat now.

136
00:14:13,398 --> 00:14:18,959
Sorry. You sent me a message this late.
I thought you had something urgent.

137
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,458
So I called you.

138
00:14:22,698 --> 00:14:25,979
It's just past 1 a.m.
There is nothing urgent.

139
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:31,038
I thought it was urgent
exactly because it's just past 1 a.m.

140
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:34,098
I was working on
the report about Yangshuo.

141
00:14:34,098 --> 00:14:36,528
I think I might have disturbed you.

142
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:38,539
I'm sorry.
I didn't notice the time.

143
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:41,040
You didn't disturb me.
I didn't sleep as well.

144
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:43,939
We are kind of
sharing a common plight, right?

145
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:46,779
Do you have any special requirements?
Just tell me.

146
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:51,039
The photos are used in the presentation.
So they just need to look good.

147
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:53,744
That's all? Sounds simple.

148
00:14:53,744 --> 00:14:56,459
I will find them and
send them to you later, okay?

149
00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:01,419
Just take your time. After all,
midnight is personal time.

150
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:03,019
I didn't want to disturb you.

151
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:08,978
No, not at all. I was just enjoying
the barbecue and drinks with my buddy.

152
00:15:10,938 --> 00:15:12,938
Calling in to check, huh? Allow me.

153
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:20,779
To whoever is on the phone,
can you hear me? I'll vouch for him.

154
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:25,479
I am a male of 40.
I'm a dinner and card game partner.

155
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:28,898
And occasionally, I give life advice
to Juemei. Come on. Cheers!

156
00:15:28,898 --> 00:15:31,239
Alright. Just go eat your food.

157
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:34,479
I'm sorry.
My friend is a little talkative.

158
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:36,379
It's okay. I'm used to it.

159
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:41,779
When you are free these days,
just send them to me. Then, goodbye.

160
00:15:43,218 --> 00:15:43,978
No.

161
00:15:46,698 --> 00:15:47,379
Good night.

162
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:50,539
Good night. Rest early.

163
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:09,059
You finished? What's the matter?
Why did you answer it in the corridor?

164
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:15,559
I was afraid to disturb your rest.
It's nothing. Let's sleep. I'm so tired.

165
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,938
Having a late-night snack, huh?

166
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,359
What brings you here?

167
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:22,918
I couldn't sleep at home.
I remembered you were here, so I came

168
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:24,938
to see if there's anything
that can be recorded now.

169
00:16:28,978 --> 00:16:30,938
- It's past 1 a.m.
- And you are here to work?

170
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:33,919
I couldn't sleep anyway.

171
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:39,218
Mo Bai said you guys went to the KTV.
Did you run off with Gu Sheng halfway?

172
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:43,818
I see why you couldn't sleep.
You just came back from a date.

173
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:49,918
Mao, can you pick something
that is short and easy for me first?

174
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:54,379
- I'll be back after taking a shower.
- Look at him. He is shy.

175
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:57,699
No. Get mine ready. I'll record first.

176
00:16:57,699 --> 00:17:01,520
- First come, first served, alright?
- No, it's not about who comes first.

177
00:17:02,032 --> 00:17:06,079
- Check the time. It's so late.
- I have things to do in a bit. Hurry.

178
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,119
I really can't understand
you young people.

179
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,858
- How about this part?
- Which...

180
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:13,658
No sleep for tonight.

181
00:17:15,858 --> 00:17:16,418
Fine.

182
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:22,384
Let's get everything done today
so I can have a good sleep tomorrow.

183
00:17:23,504 --> 00:17:25,578
I'll bite whoever dares wake me up.

184
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:36,219
Are you full?

185
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:38,098
Almost.

186
00:17:41,178 --> 00:17:45,618
- It's 6 a.m. Did you stay up all night?
- Yes.

187
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,098
We just finished work
and are going home to sleep.

188
00:17:49,098 --> 00:17:52,439
Is the work so urgent that it requires
all three of you to stay up all night?

189
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:53,699
It's a one-time thing.

190
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,238
- Time to go.
- Okay.

191
00:17:55,238 --> 00:17:58,979
- Back to sleep. See you tonight.
- Bye.

192
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:01,699
What's this? I'm leaving.

193
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:06,578
What happened?

194
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:10,759
I'm already used to it. Aren't you?

195
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:13,296
Ever since Mo got a girlfriend,

196
00:18:13,296 --> 00:18:15,338
he's been passionate
about work and life.

197
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,459
Then what about Juemei?

198
00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:22,259
I don't know.

199
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:26,839
He was the first one
to finish recording last night.

200
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,739
Then he kept
looking through photos of Guilin.

201
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:35,138
All that enthusiasm at midnight.
What's there to choose from?

202
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:41,498
By the way, where is Feng Yasong?
I haven't seen him for days.

203
00:18:41,498 --> 00:18:43,519
He's gone to Beijing again.

204
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:48,528
I'll get a friend there to record
the dubbing he owes us and send it over.

205
00:18:49,616 --> 00:18:54,019
Doudou, you are really resourceful.
You've saved me trouble again.

206
00:18:55,459 --> 00:18:57,479
Try this steamed bun. It's pretty good.

207
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:59,979
- What did you buy?
- Try this.

208
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:02,898
The soup dumplings!

209
00:19:04,338 --> 00:19:07,178
- Buns and dumplings!
- Let's eat together.

210
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:55,059
It's pretty good.

211
00:19:56,338 --> 00:20:00,178
It's okay.
And the last part was just so-so.

212
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:03,856
Ever since you two got together,
you've stopped posting on Weibo.

213
00:20:03,856 --> 00:20:06,128
People come to our club's live-stream room
every day waiting for you.

214
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,939
- Why do they do that?
- To see you display your affection.

215
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:11,499
There is nothing to be displayed.

216
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:17,299
The fans of your boyfriend
really like you.

217
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,579
They say that you've disappeared
since you were with him,

218
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:22,579
and you never displayed your affection.

219
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:27,419
Especially after your statement,
'I'm so happy', was seen by the public,

220
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:29,658
you never posted anything
about your relationship again.

221
00:20:31,219 --> 00:20:33,119
I had no experience at first.

222
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:35,056
Later, I realized people
were paying attention,

223
00:20:35,056 --> 00:20:36,272
so I stopped posting.

224
00:20:36,272 --> 00:20:38,659
Otherwise, it would cause much trouble
and provoke public discussion.

225
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:42,669
No wonder that you two are a couple.
You have the same character.

226
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:45,679
If his girlfriend were someone else,

227
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,098
they would be prancing around,
displaying their love whenever they can.

228
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,899
It's good to be low-key
so that you don't make mistakes.

229
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:56,138
- Circles come with conflicts.
- That's right.

230
00:20:57,378 --> 00:20:59,679
But your boyfriend loves to display.

231
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,919
This is the first time I've seen a man
display his love like this.

232
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:05,638
That's why Sheng
makes others even more jealous.

233
00:21:05,638 --> 00:21:09,658
Her boyfriend keeps telling others
he's taken. It gives a lot of security.

234
00:21:16,418 --> 00:21:19,298
- This song is good.
- It's for Linglong.

235
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:22,998
If you like it, I will write a new one
for you once I get inspiration.

236
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:24,016
Linglong?

237
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,738
Isn't there a rumor
that she was once with Qiang Qingci?

238
00:21:26,738 --> 00:21:28,208
If this song gets released,

239
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,872
aren't you afraid that
people online would gossip?

240
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,159
That's what worries me.

241
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,979
Maybe I should use a different name
for that song, like an alias?

242
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:39,378
Let's discuss it later.

243
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:47,119
- I won't eat with you tonight. Bye.
- Where are you going?

244
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,138
It's Friday. Where else could she go?
She is eating at her boyfriend's place.

245
00:21:52,818 --> 00:21:53,898
It's the weekend again.

246
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:59,984
To be honest, he's pretty dependable.
He spends time with you every weekend.

247
00:22:00,816 --> 00:22:06,439
Sheng is talented and good-looking.
She totally deserves someone that good.

248
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:09,458
I'm so overwhelmed by your compliment.

249
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,379
I should go.

250
00:22:11,379 --> 00:22:13,369
There's a big box of
meat mooncakes in the fridge.

251
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:15,519
- Remember to eat them.
- Okay.

252
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:16,618
- I'm off then. See you.
- Bye.

253
00:23:26,098 --> 00:23:26,858
You are here, Sheng.

254
00:23:28,499 --> 00:23:32,038
I wanted to open the door for you.
But Mo forbade me.

255
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:35,838
He said that you've never used your key.
He insists on letting you use it.

256
00:23:35,838 --> 00:23:37,178
Look at him, being all crafty.

257
00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:43,019
You're co-renting. I was worried
that you might feel uncomfortable.

258
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:47,579
Not at all. You're being too formal.
I got you some orange juice.

259
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:48,299
Thank you.

260
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:01,979
I'm making salt-and-pepper mushrooms.

261
00:24:13,858 --> 00:24:15,138
Let them all be coated in the batter.

262
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:43,898
Done.

263
00:24:49,939 --> 00:24:53,658
- Smells great. I'll take it out first.
- Wait a moment.

264
00:24:56,939 --> 00:24:58,969
You can sneak a piece.

265
00:24:58,969 --> 00:25:03,178
- The freshly-fried ones are the best.
- Are you sure?

266
00:25:08,699 --> 00:25:09,338
It's so tasty.

267
00:25:11,818 --> 00:25:16,699
You use your middle and ring fingers
when eating. Is it because of your job?

268
00:25:18,418 --> 00:25:20,179
No, it's just a personal habit.

269
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:24,858
These are for surgery,
and these are for food.

270
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:30,299
I see. I was wondering
why my grandfather didn't do this.

271
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:32,098
Have another piece.

272
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:37,939
It's so delicious.

273
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:41,338
Not bad.

274
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:47,219
You lick your fingers as much as I do,
especially when eating food with spice.

275
00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:51,338
I always eat potato chips this way,
and my mother would criticize me.

276
00:26:13,459 --> 00:26:14,138
Do you miss me?

277
00:26:17,219 --> 00:26:17,818
Yes.

278
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:21,138
How much?

279
00:26:31,138 --> 00:26:33,178
I miss you a lot.

280
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:57,178
Take it out. I'll cook the next dish.

281
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:06,739
Who would force someone else
to sweet talk?

282
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:30,578
- Have some fruit.
- Thank you.

283
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:37,719
Well, he is listening to the ending show
of the dubbing competition.

284
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:41,699
Just be quiet. He is the online guest
who is going to speak.

300
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:16,119
(Excuse me, may I interrupt?
Can I confess to... No.)

301
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:19,559
(Can I confess to one of the judges?)

302
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,779
( Don't be nervous. You definitely can.)

303
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:26,259
(I was wondering if any contestants
would interact with the judges.)

304
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:30,459
(Well, Mr. Qiang only served as a judge
in two competitions.)

305
00:29:30,459 --> 00:29:35,139
(- So I have never had the chance.
- Yes, but)

306
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:42,699
(Mr. Qiang seems to be taken already.
You need to be cautious about this.)

307
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:47,338
(- It's a different kind of confession.
- Oh, I see.)

308
00:29:47,338 --> 00:29:50,224
(- The one being confessed is so calm.
- Let me ask something first.)

309
00:29:51,024 --> 00:29:55,459
(Mr. Qiang Qingci, are you listening?)

310
00:29:57,418 --> 00:29:58,218
I am.

311
00:29:58,218 --> 00:30:02,199
(Actually, I've always enjoyed listening
to audio dramas since I was young.)

312
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:05,038
(I've always had a dream)

313
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:08,944
(of becoming a professional broadcaster
or a dubbing actor.)

314
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,770
(But due to some mishaps,
I missed out on)

315
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,639
(the related majors and colleges
during the college entrance exams.)

316
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:19,218
(But later, I had a close friend
who knew about my dream.)

317
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:23,699
(She told me she often
listened to some audio dramas online.)

318
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:27,819
(They were not of a professional nature,
but some actors are very talented,)

319
00:30:27,819 --> 00:30:30,618
(and they eventually became pros
who do commercial dubbing.)

320
00:30:30,618 --> 00:30:36,099
(At first, I was rather disdainful,
thinking that it was sensationalism.)

321
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:40,059
(But later,
after she showed me your work,)

322
00:30:41,459 --> 00:30:42,898
(I was completely convinced.)

323
00:30:45,979 --> 00:30:50,096
(What I want to say is
thank you, Mr. Qiang.)

324
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,618
(- Thanks to you, I entered this circle.
- How many people has he changed?)

325
00:30:54,618 --> 00:30:58,739
(- I have this new dream and goal.
- There must be quite a lot.)

326
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:04,098
Thank you too.

327
00:31:05,378 --> 00:31:08,499
I wish you success,
and you must be more successful than me.

328
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:15,939
(Is that all? Even I am moved by her.
Can't you talk a bit more with her?)

329
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:16,739
Keep going.

330
00:31:24,818 --> 00:31:25,338
I...

331
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:30,338
I was really moved by what I just heard.
Why didn't you say a few more words?

332
00:31:31,898 --> 00:31:34,459
If I said too much,
it might be bad for her.

333
00:31:36,699 --> 00:31:41,099
Right. You can't show any preference.
Otherwise, people will say

334
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,418
she used her confession to you
as a chance to get famous.

335
00:31:49,219 --> 00:31:50,338
There are so many comments.

336
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:55,759
I don't accept mentions from strangers.

337
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:56,839
Only friends can mention me.

338
00:31:56,912 --> 00:31:58,559
And the private message feature
is turned off.

339
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,529
I haven't quite got
this new comment feature.

340
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:04,858
That's why I received them.

341
00:32:07,178 --> 00:32:08,098
You're not angry, right?

342
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:11,499
Just a bit.

343
00:32:14,858 --> 00:32:18,096
I thought earlier
that if I had a girlfriend one day,

344
00:32:18,992 --> 00:32:21,858
she'd probably fall out with me
when seeing these.

345
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:28,319
I was kidding. I've seen these before.
'Honey, I love you' and all that.

346
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,699
I am immune to them.

347
00:32:33,739 --> 00:32:34,259
Thank you.

348
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,546
(Na: In this world full of beauty, Mr. Qiang
loves the golden piglet the most.)

349
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:50,539
I really like this artist.
Do you know her?

350
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:53,539
A friend I met from the beginning.

351
00:32:54,898 --> 00:32:57,618
It's good to have debuted early,
knowing everyone from the beginning.

352
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:05,039
(In this world full of beauty, Mr. Qiang
loves the golden piglet the most.)

353
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,219
When did I become a golden piglet?

354
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:11,539
Well.

355
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,378
What a coincidence!
Even the food is a strawberry.

356
00:33:19,939 --> 00:33:24,979
(Thanks, but the piglet isn't fat.
It's thin and can be held in hands.)

357
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,178
(When have you ever held me?)

358
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:38,939
I want to make it very clear to others
that I already have a girlfriend.

359
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:42,219
This way, a lot of unnecessary problems
can be avoided.

360
00:33:44,578 --> 00:33:46,499
So we need to be high-profile.

361
00:33:49,219 --> 00:33:51,059
It's so high-profile
that even I'm not used to it.

362
00:33:52,499 --> 00:33:54,178
You think I'm used to it?

363
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:15,539
Just as I thought.

364
00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:17,899
It can be held in hands.

365
00:34:27,218 --> 00:34:28,218
I have something for you.

A few days ago.

377
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:22,138

lots and lots of snacks tomorrow.

00:36:22,578 --> 00:36:24,819

It's very sweet.

Golden Piglet, I've finished.
Can I have some more?

391
00:36:58,899 --> 00:37:00,439
What's the matter, Golden Piglet?

392
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:03,658
- So it was you.
- What?

393
00:37:04,698 --> 00:37:07,578
Did you tell someone else
we were eating strawberries?

394
00:37:09,578 --> 00:37:13,379
Are you talking about Na's painting?
She asked me what Qiang was doing.

395
00:37:13,379 --> 00:37:15,019
I said you two were eating strawberries.

396
00:37:17,218 --> 00:37:19,664
We go way back.

397
00:37:19,664 --> 00:37:22,958
When you two get married,
they will all come.

398
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:24,859
Don't be shy. You'll get used to it.

399
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:32,819
Okay, I won't say anymore. I'm leaving.
Just pack the strawberries for me.

400
00:37:53,618 --> 00:37:54,258
It's raining.

401
00:37:56,738 --> 00:37:58,578
My car was borrowed by Wang Ke.

402
00:38:02,419 --> 00:38:04,539
Going back in such heavy rain
isn't very convenient.

403
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:08,658
How about staying here tonight?

404
00:38:15,778 --> 00:38:19,579
If it still rains this hard at 10 p.m.,
just stay here tonight.

405
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:21,979
You can sleep in my room,
and I'll sleep with Juemei.

406
00:38:27,218 --> 00:38:31,059
I need to get up early tomorrow. You can
go home by yourself when you wake up.

407
00:38:32,618 --> 00:38:35,138
- You need to get up early?
- I have a shift in the morning.

408
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,979
Then, I'll stay here.

409
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:44,979
You were hesitating just now.
Why did you suddenly agree?

410
00:38:46,379 --> 00:38:49,939
It's okay. If you don't want to stay,
I can take you back home.

411
00:38:51,339 --> 00:38:56,599
You need to get up early. You won't get
enough sleep if you take me home now.

412
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:59,899
It's fine. I'll sleep here
and go back by myself tomorrow.

413
00:39:06,298 --> 00:39:08,618
Don't worry. I won't do anything.

414
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:12,539
There's nothing to worry about.

415
00:39:14,738 --> 00:39:15,778
I'll get you some hot milk.

416
00:39:37,939 --> 00:39:40,400
Are you going to the hospital?
I can take Sheng home.

417
00:39:40,464 --> 00:39:41,378
No need.

418
00:39:41,378 --> 00:39:42,778
Don't be polite with me.

419
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:45,200
She'll stay here tonight.

420
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:50,499
S-She will?

421
00:39:53,298 --> 00:39:54,379
Alright, don't mind me.

422
00:39:57,298 --> 00:39:59,819
I won't hear anything either.

423
00:40:10,258 --> 00:40:11,379
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

424
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:14,298
Go brush your teeth after you finish.

425
00:40:18,224 --> 00:40:20,839
In the second drawer under the cabinet
on the right side of the bathroom,

426
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:23,658
you can find the new toiletries.
Just take them out and use them.

427
00:40:28,098 --> 00:40:28,859
Which one do you want?

428
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:32,778
As pajamas.

429
00:40:36,899 --> 00:40:38,459
I'm okay with anything.

430
00:40:40,578 --> 00:40:41,379
Then...

431
00:40:42,459 --> 00:40:42,859
This one?

432
00:40:45,578 --> 00:40:47,658
And a pair of pants.

433
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:56,178
I'll go out. You can take a shower now.

434
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:02,459
I won't close the door of the next room.
If you need anything, just call me.

435
00:41:06,859 --> 00:41:07,438
Night.

436
00:41:08,778 --> 00:41:09,258
Night.

437
00:41:14,698 --> 00:41:15,218
By the way,

438
00:41:16,578 --> 00:41:19,738
I may come over early tomorrow
to change clothes. Don't lock the door.

439
00:41:32,138 --> 00:41:34,179
- Why are you out again?
- I'm going to sleep.

440
00:41:34,179 --> 00:41:35,178
Where are you going to sleep?

441
00:41:49,979 --> 00:41:50,379
Wait.

442
00:41:51,459 --> 00:41:52,419
Are you sleeping with me?

443
00:41:53,499 --> 00:41:55,504
If I don't sleep with you,
who else should I sleep with?

444
00:41:56,624 --> 00:41:57,859
Go to sleep with your girlfriend.

445
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:02,738
Wait.
