(Two years later)

43
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,291
(The ending of this story is a bit long.
Are you ready?)

44
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,530
- What are you looking at? Your studio again?
- You scared me.

45
00:04:19,611 --> 00:04:21,811
No. This is our recording studio.

46
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,090
This is the registration form.
Everyone, please fill it out.

47
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,420
Our dubbing class this summer
has a total of 60 trainees.

48
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,330
And you are the last batch. Welcome.

49
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:45,571
- Off Key.
- Mr. Zhou Zheng.

50
00:04:46,148 --> 00:04:50,547
You and Xiyou go sort out this material
and print the schedule in the afternoon.

51
00:04:50,948 --> 00:04:53,068
These new trainees
are all in your care now.

52
00:04:53,787 --> 00:04:55,388
- Okay? Go ahead.
- Just rest assured.

53
00:04:57,388 --> 00:05:00,907
- You should take good care of newcomers.
- Don't worry. Leave it to me.

54
00:05:02,227 --> 00:05:05,308
Come on, everyone. Fill out the form.
If you have any questions, just ask me.

55
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:06,748
- Alright?
- Okay.

56
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:12,308
I've prepared red date tea for you all.
You can take your time.

57
00:05:12,628 --> 00:05:15,787
Before the third year of Tianqi,
I lived in the heart of Shu.

58
00:05:16,227 --> 00:05:20,907
Until one afternoon a few months ago,
a child delivered a folding fan

59
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:22,064
and a place name to me.

60
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:25,987
I remembered that fan.
I would never forget it in my lifetime.

61
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:32,948
Feishao, you need
to re-record this part.

62
00:05:33,948 --> 00:05:36,907
Alright. Come out and have some water.
I'll tell you what the problem is later.

63
00:05:37,068 --> 00:05:37,667
Okay.

64
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:43,987
Take a look at this notification
for a commercial dubbing this weekend.

65
00:05:45,427 --> 00:05:48,188
I can't do the weekend.
I'm working overtime.

66
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:54,268
- Zhou Zheng, are you free this weekend?
- I should be. What's up?

67
00:05:56,748 --> 00:05:59,547
- Then you'll be the director.
- Okay. Leave it to me.

68
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:01,708
The actors this time
are all from other studios.

69
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,464
Only a few newbies are from our studio.
I'll feel more at ease with you there.

70
00:06:05,107 --> 00:06:07,268
- Okay. No problem.
- Then I'll put you in it.

71
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,828
- Sheng.
- Happy early...

72
00:06:26,948 --> 00:06:30,508
- Graduation!
- Graduation!

73
00:06:36,948 --> 00:06:39,347
Thank goodness you came quickly,
or the pretending couldn't go on.

74
00:06:42,188 --> 00:06:43,828
- Come on.
- I don't know how to open it.

75
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:45,227
Are you still surprised?

76
00:06:50,188 --> 00:06:55,467
I was wondering why you guys ignored me,
as if you didn't see me at all.

77
00:06:57,748 --> 00:07:00,508
- How is that possible?
- Here, Sheng.

78
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:02,748
Thank you.

79
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:07,708
- The Golden Piglet enters the society now.
- Bravo!

80
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:11,778
Now that you're a member of the society,
you need to act like one.

81
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:14,268
Sheng, you should carry him home tonight.

82
00:07:15,547 --> 00:07:21,427
Mo was planning to sneak on anyway.
Don't expose him.

83
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:25,328
It's just a graduation celebration.
Don't make it look like a wedding night.

84
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:26,868
- Tone it down.
- Be gentle, will you?

85
00:07:28,508 --> 00:07:30,948
- Cheers?
- Okay. Cheers!

86
00:07:31,188 --> 00:07:35,467
- Let's all wish Sheng...
- Happy graduation!

87
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:36,347
Thank you.

88
00:07:39,948 --> 00:07:41,547
- Let's cut the cake.
- I want some cake.

89
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:42,667
- It's quite strong.
- Come on.

90
00:07:45,227 --> 00:07:46,587
Help yourself.

91
00:07:48,587 --> 00:07:52,427
- I still need half an hour.
- It's okay. Keep working. I'll wait.

92
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,272
Everyone, hurry up and eat.

93
00:07:56,272 --> 00:07:59,312
After we finish recording this part,
Feng Yasong has to go on a blind date.

94
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,427
Don't make him late.

95
00:08:02,188 --> 00:08:05,148
What? Given Feng Yasong's look,
he can't even find a date himself?

96
00:08:05,148 --> 00:08:07,708
- I can't believe it.
- Exactly. He is not that bad, right?

97
00:08:07,948 --> 00:08:09,667
The blind date was arranged
by my landlady.

98
00:08:09,868 --> 00:08:12,667
She is over 90 years old.
I don't want to make her upset.

99
00:08:13,347 --> 00:08:16,587
Shouldn't you wear a shirt, then?
It'll make you look a bit more formal.

100
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:19,824
Isn't it just going to be
a regular meal?

101
00:08:20,592 --> 00:08:24,268
He is dressed like this on purpose,
afraid that his date will fall for him.

102
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:27,667
Alright. Stop talking about me,
as I'm the easy target here.

103
00:08:27,828 --> 00:08:29,628
Let's get to work.

104
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:38,547
Feng,

105
00:08:40,427 --> 00:08:44,468
I've prepared a suit for you in Room 2.
It's ironed. Go and change.

106
00:08:46,628 --> 00:08:48,228
- That won't be necessary.
- Go change.

107
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:52,176
You are the only single man
among the Top Three.

108
00:08:52,176 --> 00:08:53,588
Try to look good on the blind date.

109
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,827
Formalism? Okay, then I'll go change.

110
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:16,272
- You look good. Who are you going to see?
- I've said it many times. I'm leaving.

111
00:09:17,296 --> 00:09:17,808
Come back.

112
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:20,972
This shoulder bag
doesn't go with your outfit.

113
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:22,512
Just take your cellphone with you.

114
00:09:23,787 --> 00:09:25,508
- I'm leaving.
- Take a cup of milk tea with you.

115
00:09:25,508 --> 00:09:26,228
Are you sure?

116
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:28,538
By the way, Doudou,

117
00:09:28,538 --> 00:09:30,187
- Mu has a favor to ask.
- Thank you.

118
00:09:31,228 --> 00:09:34,628
- Thanks.
- We are friends. Just say it.

119
00:09:35,187 --> 00:09:36,897
My company is
organizing a pairing activity

120
00:09:36,897 --> 00:09:37,947
for singles this afternoon.

121
00:09:37,947 --> 00:09:39,868
Men can bring a girlfriend
if they have one, so...

122
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:45,360
What are you doing?

123
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,438
Do you want my partner
to pretend to be your girlfriend?

124
00:09:47,438 --> 00:09:48,707
Yes, that's what I'm asking.

125
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:53,787
Sure, I'm free today anyway.

126
00:09:54,947 --> 00:09:56,144
Who says you're free?

127
00:09:57,187 --> 00:10:00,947
We've just recruited some trainees,
and there is a training class and such.

128
00:10:00,947 --> 00:10:02,427
There's a lot to be busy with.

129
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,547
Doudou didn't say no. You...

130
00:10:09,827 --> 00:10:11,868
That's right. Mu can't go alone, right?

131
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:15,067
Am I not a friend to you?

132
00:10:17,388 --> 00:10:20,307
No. It's just that she is a single girl.
And you guys...

133
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:31,868
Never mind. Do whatever you want.
I'm leaving. It's too sweet.

134
00:10:32,868 --> 00:10:33,388
You...

135
00:10:34,547 --> 00:10:35,707
What's wrong with him?

136
00:10:42,027 --> 00:10:44,307
- Do I need to prepare anything?
- Xiyou, have some milk tea.

137
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:46,827
Just change into something formal.

138
00:10:48,628 --> 00:10:50,667
- Thank you for agreeing to do that.
- When did you buy these?

139
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,887
I'm not very familiar
with my female coworkers.

140
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:55,427
It's okay. We're friends.
There's no need to be polite.

141
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,707
Rest assured. I will change into
something nice. I won't embarrass you.

142
00:10:58,868 --> 00:10:59,907
I-It's not necessary.

143
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:02,827
Why are you back?

144
00:11:04,388 --> 00:11:07,907
I'm back for the car keys.
It's getting late. I'll drive there.

145
00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:21,268
You don't have to do anything.
We'll leave after a while.

146
00:11:24,707 --> 00:11:26,827
I'm leaving now.

147
00:11:28,148 --> 00:11:28,988
Are you coming back?

148
00:11:30,307 --> 00:11:32,464
I will come back after the date.
Don't wait for me for dinner.

149
00:11:35,348 --> 00:11:38,468
Actually, I don't really want to go,
but I have no choice.

150
00:11:39,988 --> 00:11:43,696
- Then send me the time later.
- I'm really leaving.

151
00:11:45,427 --> 00:11:48,427
Just go ahead. Aren't you in a hurry?
And drive slowly.

152
00:11:49,787 --> 00:11:50,307
Goodbye.

153
00:11:56,827 --> 00:11:59,228
- Come on.
- Happy weekend!

154
00:12:04,588 --> 00:12:07,348
- How do you know Mu?
- Yeah, tell us all about it.

155
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:11,148
- We just...
- Are you a cosplayer too?

156
00:12:11,827 --> 00:12:13,827
- Yes, I am.
- No wonder. That explains it.

157
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:15,468
- Right.
- They're such a good match.

158
00:12:15,787 --> 00:12:20,787
- Mu is nice. He just doesn't talk much.
- Right. Just be more patient with him.

159
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:21,707
- Yes.
- Okay.

160
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:24,187
- How long have you known each other?
- Why are you so curious?

161
00:12:26,388 --> 00:12:28,388
- Let's eat.
- Okay. Let's eat.

162
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,064
(Where are you? What are you doing?)

163
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:50,748
Would you like to eat something?

164
00:12:52,827 --> 00:12:53,427
Okay.

165
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,800
(Seafood)

166
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:11,216
I'm sorry. Honestly,

167
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:14,707
I came as I didn't want
to disappoint my landlady.

168
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:23,027
You can order whatever you'd like today
and consider it my treat.

169
00:13:23,547 --> 00:13:28,307
- I got it. So you have a girlfriend?
- How could that be possible?

170
00:13:28,547 --> 00:13:31,588
If I had a girlfriend and still came,
what kind of person would that make me?

171
00:13:31,947 --> 00:13:33,108
Then you...

172
00:13:34,187 --> 00:13:36,748
I don't know either.
Maybe I'm just destined

173
00:13:37,787 --> 00:13:38,588
to be alone.

174
00:13:43,307 --> 00:13:48,667
Well, let me see.
King crab? Or maybe a lobster?

175
00:13:50,027 --> 00:13:51,667
Are you starting
with the expensive items?

176
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,588
Having you come all this way,
I should treat you something nice.

177
00:13:56,947 --> 00:13:57,748
A steak will be fine.

178
00:13:58,228 --> 00:13:59,907
- Who chose this place? It's nice.
- Okay.

179
00:13:59,988 --> 00:14:02,307
- Then, hurry back.
- Come back soon. We're waiting for you.

180
00:14:15,148 --> 00:14:16,988
If not, let's watch a movie.

181
00:14:29,588 --> 00:14:35,348
(Dear friends, after saying farewell
to tonight, we'll reunite in the spring.)

182
00:14:35,468 --> 00:14:40,468
(Here, a 5,000-year-old dream
glimmers and blooms resplendently.)

183
00:14:40,827 --> 00:14:42,987
- (This is our 5,000-year-old home.)
- Feng Yasong?

184
00:14:42,987 --> 00:14:47,988
- (It's prosperous and full of life.)
- Why didn't you go home for the Festival?

185
00:14:48,827 --> 00:14:52,988
I only have one day off this year.
And I have to be on call. I'm staying.

186
00:14:55,307 --> 00:14:59,628
It's quite a meal you ordered today.

187
00:14:59,787 --> 00:15:04,268
- The Spring Festival is once a year.
- So I'm lucky to catch this.

188
00:15:05,748 --> 00:15:09,268
You are here in time. How about we
celebrate the Spring Festival together?

189
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:11,148
Okay. Wait for me to get a cup.

190
00:15:16,508 --> 00:15:18,027
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

191
00:15:23,707 --> 00:15:24,388
Cool.

192
00:16:00,268 --> 00:16:01,268
So,

193
00:16:02,348 --> 00:16:03,988
do you have a secret girlfriend or not?

194
00:16:07,827 --> 00:16:13,707
If I had a girlfriend, I'd make it public.
Why would I have a secret relationship?

195
00:16:25,187 --> 00:16:27,787
Well, it's quite funny for both of us.

196
00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:31,108
We are pretty good-looking,
yet we have been single until now.

197
00:16:34,508 --> 00:16:39,468
You had a few suitors, and they were good.
Why didn't you accept them?

198
00:16:41,388 --> 00:16:42,448
I had no feelings for them.

199
00:16:44,947 --> 00:16:47,707
Feelings are too elusive, aren't they?

200
00:16:49,027 --> 00:16:50,427
Only you girls believe in them.

201
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:55,628
Feelings are important
in a relationship, alright?

202
00:16:57,988 --> 00:17:02,588
Feelings are not reliable.
They might come, and they might leave.

203
00:17:11,068 --> 00:17:15,267
Hurry up. It's the countdown.
Come on. Come on.

204
00:17:16,388 --> 00:17:20,227
- Five! Four! Three! Two! One!
- Five! Four! Three! Two! One!

205
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:22,128
- Happy Chinese New Year!
- Happy Chinese New Year!

206
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:54,788
I drank a bit too much.
I'll go home now.

207
00:17:56,148 --> 00:17:58,308
- Can you do that?
- I...

208
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:00,108
Sure.

209
00:18:01,187 --> 00:18:02,828
Then, take care.

210
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,868
I'll clean this up.

211
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:09,467
No need. Let me do it. I can do it.

212
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:14,987
Okay, then I am leaving.

213
00:18:17,456 --> 00:18:20,907
I'll come back tomorrow morning.
Let's have breakfast together.

214
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:22,467
Okay.

215
00:18:23,907 --> 00:18:26,028
- My cellphone.
- Here. Take it.

216
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:27,028
Then, I'm off.

217
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:29,388
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

218
00:18:29,828 --> 00:18:33,068
- Take care. Let me know when you're home.
- Okay.

219
00:18:52,788 --> 00:18:56,048
What's wrong? If you don't like this,
I can take you home first.

220
00:18:57,104 --> 00:18:59,824
Not at all.
Your coworkers are all quite funny.

221
00:19:00,868 --> 00:19:04,747
I probably didn't get enough rest
yesterday. I'm a little tired.

222
00:19:07,308 --> 00:19:09,628
- I thought you were upset.
- No.

223
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:18,227
I wonder
how Feng Yasong's blind date is going.

224
00:19:19,907 --> 00:19:24,308
He's finally decided to find
a girlfriend. He should take the chance.

225
00:19:27,308 --> 00:19:29,616
Dates introduced by acquaintances
are more likely to work out

226
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,888
as they know each other better.

227
00:19:32,747 --> 00:19:33,388
Don't worry.

228
00:19:37,227 --> 00:19:37,707
That's good.

229
00:19:39,788 --> 00:19:40,987
You are quite experienced.

230
00:19:42,267 --> 00:19:43,028
It's what others say.

231
00:19:44,548 --> 00:19:45,267
I'll go in first.

232
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:47,108
I'll be there soon.

233
00:20:09,392 --> 00:20:11,792
(Mo Bai)

234
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:23,467
- Hello?
- Hello, this is Feng Yasong.

235
00:20:24,028 --> 00:20:26,788
- Is everything okay with Doudou?
- What could possibly go wrong?

236
00:20:26,907 --> 00:20:29,588
Going out with one of our own people
is the safest.

237
00:20:29,947 --> 00:20:31,588
- Alright. I'm hanging up now.
- Wait. She...

238
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:36,667
Is there something urgent?

239
00:20:37,707 --> 00:20:39,548
You seemed pretty anxious
when you were paying the bill.

240
00:20:40,028 --> 00:20:42,128
If you have something urgent,
you can go first. It's okay.

241
00:20:43,028 --> 00:20:44,907
I do have something urgent. I'm sorry.

242
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:49,308
If your friends' or relatives' children
need medical attention in the future,

243
00:20:49,427 --> 00:20:50,068
you can tell me.

244
00:20:50,588 --> 00:20:53,068
- I have to go now. Bye.
- Bye.

245
00:20:59,628 --> 00:21:01,548
You and Mu
look better and better together.

246
00:21:01,987 --> 00:21:04,628
He's never mentioned having a girlfriend
when he's at school.

247
00:21:04,747 --> 00:21:06,348
We always thought he was single.

248
00:21:07,707 --> 00:21:12,667
- We're usually busy, so...
- I understand.

249
00:21:38,907 --> 00:21:39,828
Is he your friend?

250
00:21:41,308 --> 00:21:42,348
He is

251
00:21:43,507 --> 00:21:44,187
my younger brother.

252
00:21:45,828 --> 00:21:47,348
- Hello.
- Hi.

253
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:50,320
Why didn't you respond
to my WeChat messages?

254
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:52,267
You sent me WeChat messages?

255
00:21:53,868 --> 00:21:54,828
I didn't check my phone.

256
00:21:56,907 --> 00:21:57,968
Why didn't you answer my call?

257
00:21:58,947 --> 00:22:01,667
Would you come over so quickly
if I answered?

258
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:10,348
Your brother really cares about you.
You must love him a lot.

259
00:22:15,108 --> 00:22:17,068
Let's hurry up and leave
before it starts raining heavily.

260
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:19,628
- Bye.
- Bye.

261
00:22:19,747 --> 00:22:20,308
Goodbye.

262
00:22:24,588 --> 00:22:29,707
- Doudou, you have worked hard today.
- What's hard about being with you three?

263
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,227
- I'll sit in the back row.
- Why?

264
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:33,868
Mo Bai, come in.

265
00:22:35,068 --> 00:22:37,788
Why are you jostling for the back row?
I can't believe him.

266
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:25,348
What?

267
00:23:32,068 --> 00:23:34,868
Why are the two of you here?
To watch the show?

268
00:23:37,108 --> 00:23:37,628
I...

269
00:23:39,227 --> 00:23:43,987
Feng said he's worried about you.
He insisted on coming to have a look.

270
00:23:45,187 --> 00:23:48,467
I am not 'single' today.
What's there to worry about?

271
00:23:50,588 --> 00:23:53,947
You're too deep in character.
Mu didn't take it seriously. You did.

272
00:23:54,907 --> 00:23:58,308
- What's the attitude? I'm your sister.
- Who said you were my sister?

273
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:03,148
Haven't you been calling me that
for so many years?

274
00:24:15,068 --> 00:24:17,707
I came to pick you up,
and you didn't even thank me.

275
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:24,227
Thank you. Alright?

276
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:26,548
Childish.

277
00:24:33,028 --> 00:24:33,628
They two...

278
00:24:47,707 --> 00:24:50,148
Let's go as soon as
we get out of the car.

279
00:25:49,987 --> 00:25:50,667
It smells good.

280
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,947
- Bring over the tomatoes for me.
- The tomatoes?

281
00:26:22,828 --> 00:26:23,568
Careful. It's hot.

282
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,588
Check my phone for me.
Is it the hospital?

283
00:26:51,947 --> 00:26:57,788
It's Mu. He said Doudou didn't eat well
tonight, and we should cook her share.

284
00:27:00,628 --> 00:27:01,267
I guessed it.

285
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:03,628
You could even guess this?

286
00:27:05,628 --> 00:27:08,828
Open the refrigerator.
Take out the breaded pork chops in it

287
00:27:08,947 --> 00:27:12,588
- and the vacuum-packed steak.
- Okay.

288
00:27:13,148 --> 00:27:15,308
- Then...
- It's okay. You can keep my phone.

289
00:27:15,507 --> 00:27:18,588
Keep an eye on my messages and calls.
If it's from the hospital, let me know.

290
00:27:19,588 --> 00:27:22,427
So transparent?
Aren't you afraid I'll look?

291
00:27:24,707 --> 00:27:25,427
Feel free to look.

292
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:27,028
Okay.

293
00:27:42,548 --> 00:27:46,187
You haven't told me how you knew
Doudou didn't eat well tonight.

294
00:27:48,427 --> 00:27:50,348
Maybe you'll know in a moment.

295
00:27:59,747 --> 00:28:02,287
Wait. Don't go in yet. Come over here.

296
00:28:02,287 --> 00:28:04,947
What's up?
I've been putting up with you.

297
00:28:05,068 --> 00:28:07,536
I've been putting up with you all day.

298
00:28:07,536 --> 00:28:08,987
What did I do
to make you put up with me?

299
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,388
You know what you did.

300
00:28:11,947 --> 00:28:14,068
- Did I mess up your blind date?
- No.

301
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:16,304
You pretended to be other's girlfriend.

302
00:28:16,304 --> 00:28:18,467
What's wrong with that?
I was willing to.

303
00:28:19,108 --> 00:28:21,227
Besides, it's none of your business.

304
00:28:23,308 --> 00:28:26,788
D-Didn't you say I was your brother?
Of course, I have a say in this.

305
00:28:31,947 --> 00:28:35,987
- Wait a moment.
- Stop it. I'm tired.

306
00:28:36,068 --> 00:28:39,747
You thought it wouldn't be tiring
to eat and drink with strangers all day?

307
00:28:40,308 --> 00:28:43,068
I told you not to go,
but you insisted on going.

308
00:28:43,068 --> 00:28:46,907
Mu and Mo Bai are my friends,
and they simply asked for a favor.

309
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:51,588
Besides, I have nothing better to do
this afternoon.

310
00:28:52,628 --> 00:28:56,148
You can tell me if you want
to go somewhere. I can accompany you.

311
00:29:04,227 --> 00:29:07,828
Feng, have you forgotten
where you went this afternoon?

312
00:29:11,467 --> 00:29:12,947
- I can't believe you.
- Wait.

313
00:29:12,987 --> 00:29:15,227
I haven't finished yet.
Why are you in such a hurry?

314
00:29:15,348 --> 00:29:18,267
- Go inside if you have anything to say.
- There are other people inside.

315
00:29:18,388 --> 00:29:20,507
- What can't we say in front of others?
- I...

316
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:29,108
Sheng.

317
00:29:37,707 --> 00:29:41,548
I saw you two coming back.
I wanted to get something from the car.

318
00:29:43,467 --> 00:29:45,227
- Here.
- Thank you.

319
00:29:46,427 --> 00:29:48,028
- Then we'll go inside first.
- Okay.

320
00:30:07,828 --> 00:30:08,472
Welcome back.

321
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:11,427
- Have you eaten?
- Yes, I have.

322
00:30:14,028 --> 00:30:16,868
I guess you didn't eat enough.
How about we eat some more together?

323
00:30:19,028 --> 00:30:22,907
Mu said that Doudou didn't eat well
and asked me to make more food.

324
00:30:24,868 --> 00:30:27,308
There were too many people.
I was just busy talking.

325
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:31,388
He really cares about you.

326
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:42,507
Sheng.

327
00:30:44,028 --> 00:30:46,096
You should've told me to get the drinks.

328
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:47,348
It's okay.

329
00:30:47,987 --> 00:30:51,068
We heard you two quarreled,
so we dared not let you get them.

330
00:30:51,548 --> 00:30:54,507
- No, we didn't.
- Right, we didn't.

331
00:30:54,947 --> 00:30:59,308
- We are getting along just fine.
- Who is getting along with you?

332
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,187
- Don't touch me.
- Well...

333
00:31:05,068 --> 00:31:06,908
So you went to
pick her up after your date?

334
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:08,267
Yes, I picked her up on the way.

335
00:31:08,628 --> 00:31:11,747
That's right. Mu and Mo Bai
were supposed to come back with us.

336
00:31:11,868 --> 00:31:14,968
But they got off just before we arrived.

337
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:15,548
Right.

338
00:31:15,828 --> 00:31:17,907
- The four of us came back together.
- Yes, together.

339
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:22,868
You two are quite in sync today.
You quarrel and make up quickly.

340
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:25,747
We didn't quarrel.

341
00:31:28,227 --> 00:31:30,588
Well, I'm going to wash a few cups.

342
00:31:31,707 --> 00:31:33,148
I will help you.

343
00:31:45,388 --> 00:31:47,267
Did Feng Yasong get jealous
because he likes Doudou?

344
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:51,028
- When did it begin?
- I don't know.

345
00:31:51,628 --> 00:31:54,308
- Are you keeping from me again?
- I really don't know.

346
00:31:55,507 --> 00:31:57,427
Well, it was just a hunch.

347
00:31:57,907 --> 00:32:01,747
I've known them for too long.
I can sense if something is off.

348
00:32:02,068 --> 00:32:04,108
When was the earliest time
you sensed it?

349
00:32:04,628 --> 00:32:07,267
It was on the first day
of the Chinese New Year.

350
00:32:07,388 --> 00:32:10,788
I saw them have breakfast in the studio
when I came back from working overtime.

351
00:32:12,267 --> 00:32:13,068
It should be that time.

352
00:32:17,747 --> 00:32:18,788
No need. I'll wash these.

353
00:32:36,947 --> 00:32:37,907
Don't tell people

354
00:32:38,947 --> 00:32:40,272
that I'm your younger brother anymore.

355
00:32:41,227 --> 00:32:43,667
I have been calling you that
for so many years.

356
00:32:44,828 --> 00:32:46,068
Then don't do that starting today.

357
00:32:48,987 --> 00:32:49,628
Did you hear me?

358
00:32:53,456 --> 00:32:54,288
Give it to me.

359
00:33:06,148 --> 00:33:07,108
Starting now,

360
00:33:08,148 --> 00:33:09,987
if you call me your brother again,
I'll get mad at you.

361
00:33:13,507 --> 00:33:14,907
Do you think I'm scared of you?

362
00:33:18,108 --> 00:33:19,187
I'm scared of you, alright?

363
00:33:26,068 --> 00:33:26,388
Give me.

364
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:09,707
Why are you smiling at me?
I'm not Gu Sheng.

365
00:34:11,187 --> 00:34:14,948
Perhaps you know better than I do
why I'm smiling at you.

366
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:19,468
I...

367
00:34:21,508 --> 00:34:22,544
You have something to say?

368
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,064
Even if you have something to say,
it's no use telling me.

369
00:34:27,088 --> 00:34:29,347
I don't have anything to say.

370
00:34:30,428 --> 00:34:31,908
Even if I do, I won't say it to you.

371
00:34:33,508 --> 00:34:34,588
Smart choice.

372
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:37,548
Aren't there bowls outside?
Why do you get more?

373
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:39,728
They're for drinking soup.

374
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:43,267
Here come the bowls.

375
00:34:53,307 --> 00:34:53,787
Okay.

376
00:34:57,267 --> 00:34:58,548
You went away for a long time.

377
00:35:00,468 --> 00:35:04,998
My grandma often makes
borscht during the Spring Festival.

378
00:35:04,998 --> 00:35:07,148
It goes perfectly with rice.

379
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:10,707
Like this?

380
00:35:15,468 --> 00:35:16,108
Thank you.

381
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:31,408
Let me serve you some.

382
00:35:32,272 --> 00:35:33,776
You can also soak the rice in it.

383
00:35:38,384 --> 00:35:39,307
Okay.

384
00:35:54,387 --> 00:35:55,728
- Thank you.
- Eat it while it's hot.

385
00:36:07,187 --> 00:36:12,304
Come on, get ready.
Smile. Three, two, one.

386
00:36:13,028 --> 00:36:16,747
One more. Three, two, one.

387
00:36:17,747 --> 00:36:19,387
Okay, it's my turn now. Come on.

388
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:22,628
- Wait a moment. I haven't finished yet.
- Hurry up and help me take a picture.

389
00:36:25,347 --> 00:36:26,707
Hurry up.

390
00:36:29,148 --> 00:36:29,588
Come on.

391
00:36:31,468 --> 00:36:31,948
Come on.

392
00:36:33,428 --> 00:36:36,347
Why did you two start hugging?
Just hurry up and take the picture.

393
00:36:37,468 --> 00:36:40,908
Okay. Three, two, one.

394
00:36:41,707 --> 00:36:44,628
- I'll take a wide shot for you guys.
- Okay, be quick.

395
00:36:47,028 --> 00:36:49,187
Three, two...

396
00:36:55,227 --> 00:36:57,067
Which one is your boyfriend?

397
00:36:57,067 --> 00:36:59,667
Today, we can finally
meet your boyfriend.

398
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:01,347
Both of them look pretty good.

399
00:37:02,347 --> 00:37:05,428
- What brings you here?
- I came to see you.

400
00:37:06,428 --> 00:37:08,108
- Congratulations on graduating!
- Thank you.

401
00:37:08,428 --> 00:37:11,707
Aren't you going to take a photo
with him in your cap and gown?

402
00:37:12,307 --> 00:37:14,827
- Hurry up.
- Then I'll go ahead.

403
00:37:15,468 --> 00:37:16,667
Come down now, Sheng.

404
00:37:17,108 --> 00:37:18,187
- Just go.
- Go.

405
00:37:19,707 --> 00:37:20,784
I'll take a photo for you.

406
00:37:23,148 --> 00:37:24,628
Don't you think it's hot?

407
00:37:26,747 --> 00:37:28,827
Just ignore him.

408
00:37:31,387 --> 00:37:33,588
- Let's go. I'll take photos for you.
- Okay.

409
00:37:34,227 --> 00:37:35,867
Forget it. There are too many people.

410
00:37:36,948 --> 00:37:38,160
Wasn't it you who jumped at me?

411
00:37:39,187 --> 00:37:42,032
- I was too happy just now.
- You are not happy anymore?

412
00:37:43,088 --> 00:37:46,108
Now, I can't out-talk you.

413
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:48,667
When were you ever able to out-talk me?

414
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:54,512
Would you like to come over
and take a picture with me?

415
00:37:56,628 --> 00:37:57,227
Happy graduation!

416
00:37:58,003 --> 00:38:01,549
(Flight to Guilin)

417
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:05,988
- When did you buy these?
- Last night.

418
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:09,227
When is the flight?

419
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:15,347
- This afternoon.
- Today? I will be taking photos then.

420
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:20,068
I go pack my stuff ten minutes after this.
Will that be too late?

421
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:23,227
No. I have to go and pack now,
or I'll be late.

422
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:27,747
Xiaoxing, will you help me pack?
My flight to Yangshuo is this afternoon.

423
00:38:27,747 --> 00:38:31,227
Wait, I've agreed to take photos
with them. They are waiting for me.

424
00:38:31,948 --> 00:38:33,667
Alright, then I'll go back
and pack up first.

425
00:38:33,787 --> 00:38:36,707
- I'm going back to the dorm now.
- I've packed up for you.

426
00:38:37,988 --> 00:38:41,148
Mo has already arranged everything
in case it's too late.

427
00:39:03,227 --> 00:39:07,148
I've missed you guys so much.
Sheng, you really are my lucky star.

428
00:39:07,307 --> 00:39:10,747
Only you can make the Perfect Voice
accompany you on a graduation trip.

429
00:39:11,747 --> 00:39:13,548
- Do you want to eat beer fish?
- Yes!

430
00:39:13,588 --> 00:39:15,108
- Let's go and check in first.
- Let's go.

431
00:39:15,108 --> 00:39:16,267
- Let's go.
- Okay.

432
00:39:19,347 --> 00:39:21,428
What are you thinking about,
smiling so happily?

433
00:39:21,908 --> 00:39:25,747
The river snails rice noodles,
stir-fried river shrimp, and that hotpot.

434
00:39:26,468 --> 00:39:30,988
- Spotted fish hotpot?
- Yes, the spotted fish hotpot.

435
00:39:31,347 --> 00:39:32,707
Come. This way.

436
00:39:34,148 --> 00:39:36,112
Everything is arranged.
Just check in with your ID cards.

437
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:38,307
- Where is my ID card?
- Here it is.

438
00:39:41,787 --> 00:39:42,307
For you two.

439
00:39:43,707 --> 00:39:44,827
A private place only for you.

440
00:39:46,827 --> 00:39:47,984
You're so thoughtful, Mr. Zhu.

441
00:39:48,148 --> 00:39:50,628
Of course. This is your second visit.
I have to perform well.

442
00:39:51,227 --> 00:39:52,827
- Just take it.
- No, thank you.

443
00:39:52,948 --> 00:39:55,908
We can stay, just like everyone else.
Don't make it special for us.

444
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,737
I let him book it. It's peak season now.

445
00:39:58,737 --> 00:40:01,428
You need to book a villa
a month in advance.

446
00:40:01,628 --> 00:40:03,428
- That's right.
- A month in advance?

447
00:40:03,428 --> 00:40:06,387
- Yes.
- And he said it was a spontaneous idea.

448
00:40:06,508 --> 00:40:10,387
- You shouldn't believe what he said.
- You guys check in quickly.

449
00:40:10,628 --> 00:40:12,707
- Mr. Zhu.
- Stop fussing.

450
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,428
Isn't there one for the two of us?

451
00:40:16,787 --> 00:40:17,680
It should be this one.

452
00:40:21,187 --> 00:40:24,468
We all came together.
Is it good if we live here alone?

453
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,256
Of course, it is.

454
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:32,080
Aren't we telling the whole world
that we are living together?

455
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:34,544
Aren't we supposed to live together?

456
00:40:38,707 --> 00:40:39,187
We're here.

457
00:40:45,948 --> 00:40:47,504
Please come in, Ms. Shengshengman.

458
00:40:48,548 --> 00:40:49,988
Okay, Mr. Qiang.

459
00:40:55,028 --> 00:40:55,387
Allow me.

460
00:40:59,428 --> 00:41:02,707
- How is it?
- Not bad. There's also a yard.

461
00:41:28,187 --> 00:41:30,068
- I forgot to tell you something.
- What's it?

462
00:41:30,747 --> 00:41:32,068
I bought a place

463
00:41:34,028 --> 00:41:34,948
next to the studio.

464
00:41:36,908 --> 00:41:38,707
I wanted to tell you
after the renovation is done.

465
00:41:39,827 --> 00:41:44,307
I want you to decide on decoration styles
since it will be your home too.

466
00:41:48,468 --> 00:41:52,688
I've already found a designer.
Let's meet with them when we go back

467
00:41:53,712 --> 00:41:55,120
and tell them the style you like.

468
00:42:00,227 --> 00:42:01,908
Really? Are you serious?

469
00:42:04,787 --> 00:42:07,497
A duplex with three bedrooms,
one living room,

470
00:42:07,497 --> 00:42:10,548
an open kitchen, two bathrooms,
and a walk-in closet.

471
00:42:12,068 --> 00:42:12,656
So big?

472
00:42:13,712 --> 00:42:14,288
It's not bad.

473
00:42:15,307 --> 00:42:17,168
It's bigger than the one
Zhou Zheng and I rented.

474
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:20,108
Considering our future living needs,

475
00:42:21,307 --> 00:42:22,628
three bedrooms are necessary.

476
00:42:27,984 --> 00:42:28,988
And it has two balconies.

477
00:42:32,068 --> 00:42:32,747
That's about it.

478
00:42:34,307 --> 00:42:35,347
Anything else you want to know?

479
00:42:37,867 --> 00:42:38,588
Let me think.

480
00:42:40,387 --> 00:42:42,867
Take your time.
I'll go inside and take a look.

481
00:42:54,347 --> 00:42:55,824
When did this happen?

482
00:42:57,028 --> 00:43:01,667
- The idea, or the time looking for it?
- When did the thought first occur?

483
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:08,428
It was two years ago. It was the day
I first told you I wanted to marry you.

484
00:43:09,468 --> 00:43:12,272
- That early?
- I have been busy with work.

485
00:43:13,148 --> 00:43:15,428
So I looked for condos
on and off for a long time.

486
00:43:16,387 --> 00:43:19,387
It's not scientific. I didn't notice
that you were looking for a place.

487
00:43:19,747 --> 00:43:20,707
How isn't it scientific?

488
00:43:21,948 --> 00:43:23,667
But I did not contribute a penny.

489
00:43:24,787 --> 00:43:29,588
But even if I want to, I can't.
I'll have to work for at least two years.

490
00:43:31,428 --> 00:43:34,508
It's so embarrassing to have you
buy the apartment all by yourself.

491
00:43:36,368 --> 00:43:36,944
How about

492
00:43:37,988 --> 00:43:40,148
we buy another one
after I earn a lot of money?

493
00:43:40,548 --> 00:43:43,908
So we can live in one place for some days
and the other days in another.

494
00:43:44,028 --> 00:43:46,707
On the weekends,
we can either go to your place or mine.

495
00:43:48,272 --> 00:43:49,387
I am serious.

496
00:43:50,468 --> 00:43:51,028
Okay.

497
00:43:52,347 --> 00:43:52,988
Your call.

498
00:43:56,108 --> 00:43:56,827
Are you happy?

499
00:43:59,187 --> 00:43:59,787
Yes.

500
00:44:00,988 --> 00:44:03,504
It's just indescribable.

501
00:44:04,548 --> 00:44:06,704
- Suddenly, we have our own place.
- "Suddenly"?

502
00:44:07,856 --> 00:44:08,656
Isn't it so?

503
00:44:09,667 --> 00:44:12,336
I waited for you from your senior year
