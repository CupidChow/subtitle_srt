=Episode 14=

25
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:44,636
(This is my girlfriend, Gu Sheng)

26
00:01:47,076 --> 00:01:50,315
But I can't decide what to eat.

27
00:01:53,476 --> 00:01:54,556
Any particular requirements?

28
00:01:58,716 --> 00:02:00,996
Something appetizing and filling.

29
00:02:02,435 --> 00:02:06,736
No need to make such complicated dishes.
A staple that can fill me up is enough.

30
00:02:06,736 --> 00:02:09,036
That way I don't have to
go to the canteen.

31
00:02:14,436 --> 00:02:14,795
OK.

32
00:02:15,955 --> 00:02:21,175
Mr. Mo, it's almost ready inside.
We'll start in half an hour.

33
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:25,656
- OK, I'll go cook some rice.
- Cooking rice now? Why?

34
00:02:25,656 --> 00:02:28,515
I will need it for tomorrow morning.
Fried overnight rice tastes good.

35
00:02:29,995 --> 00:02:33,475
- It's his hobby. You don't understand.
- It's a pity he's not a chef.

36
00:02:33,475 --> 00:02:40,475
Mr. Mo is so serious, whether at work,
in cooking or in love.

37
00:02:40,475 --> 00:02:43,795
That's right. A serious man
is the most attractive.

38
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:50,856
What about you? Half an hour to go.
Show us your seriousness in a while.

39
00:02:50,856 --> 00:02:52,675
Show us your charm.

40
00:02:57,596 --> 00:02:59,115
- Let's do it.
- What?

41
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:00,755
Don't wait for half an hour.
Let's do it now.

42
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:03,576
Record my part first. Come on.
I'll get started right away.

43
00:03:03,576 --> 00:03:05,235
- Now?
- Right.

44
00:03:06,476 --> 00:03:07,476
What's wrong with this guy?

45
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:09,995
Why are you so proactive today?

46
00:03:12,036 --> 00:03:13,515
Be careful with my wires.
They're expensive.

47
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:20,876
Is he crazy?

48
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:23,036
Come on.

49
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:46,196
- Too early even for the morning shift.
- Go back to sleep.

50
00:04:47,316 --> 00:04:48,395
What are you cooking?

51
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:50,355
Sour cabbage fried rice.

52
00:04:51,395 --> 00:04:52,196
Why are you up?

53
00:04:53,915 --> 00:04:54,636
Went to the bathroom.

54
00:04:56,355 --> 00:04:58,116
You didn't eat enough last night?

55
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,556
- It smells so good.
- With enough ingredients, after all.

56
00:05:09,636 --> 00:05:11,076
You're good at cooking everything.

57
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:17,196
Smells so good at five in the morning.
Now I can't fall back asleep.

58
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:19,475
Go to sleep. It's not for you.

59
00:05:21,796 --> 00:05:22,595
Not for me?

60
00:05:41,636 --> 00:05:42,756
Save me some.

61
00:05:45,196 --> 00:05:48,775
This is too much for a girl.

62
00:05:48,775 --> 00:05:51,395
- She has roommates.
- Roommates?

63
00:05:53,515 --> 00:05:54,236
Geng Xiaoxing.

64
00:05:58,915 --> 00:06:03,155
Okay, there's congee in the pot.
Find some pickles and make do with it.

65
00:06:06,436 --> 00:06:11,035
- What pickles? Where?
- There. Salted eggs are in the fridge.

66
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,196
What the heck?

67
00:06:25,196 --> 00:06:26,636
- Morning, Gu Sheng.
- Morning.

68
00:06:32,236 --> 00:06:35,236
- You're up.
- You went out?

69
00:06:35,236 --> 00:06:37,935
She set an early alarm
and left in the morning.

70
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:41,696
- And what's that?
- Lunch.

71
00:06:41,696 --> 00:06:43,636
Is it from your family's supermarket?

72
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:47,395
Someone made it. He cooked it
before going to work this morning.

73
00:06:49,515 --> 00:06:53,636
Our school is not without a canteen.
He sent it over is to make us jealous?

74
00:06:53,636 --> 00:06:56,676
That's right. I'm jealous
even though I have a boyfriend.

75
00:06:56,676 --> 00:06:59,515
I'll share it with you guys.
He specially made multiple servings.

76
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:05,356
- Mr. Qiang is the best!
- Sheng, I take back what I just said.

77
00:07:05,356 --> 00:07:06,475
You brush your teeth first.

78
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,640
- Sheng, I want a large portion, okay?
- Alright.

79
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,236
Didn't think I'd have the chance to...

80
00:07:12,236 --> 00:07:16,496
- Stop talking. Let me brush first.
- That's my idol's meal. I go first.

81
00:07:16,496 --> 00:07:20,035
- So what? I will eat the most later.
- Enough. Stop talking and just brush.

82
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:24,196
- I'm on a diet, but I can eat a lot.
- Don't eat so much when you're dieting.

83
00:07:32,996 --> 00:07:35,516
And this, too? Okay.

84
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:38,475
Next month won't be as busy.
It'll be hard this month.

85
00:07:42,316 --> 00:07:45,236
This is at 3:20 PM.

86
00:07:46,996 --> 00:07:50,116
It's at 3:20 PM.

87
00:07:58,595 --> 00:07:59,035
Like this?

88
00:08:02,676 --> 00:08:04,715
They are only available today
from 10 to 12 o'clock.

89
00:08:06,116 --> 00:08:08,275
- What are you doing?
- Arranging shifts.

90
00:08:13,756 --> 00:08:15,035
Note this down.

91
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:22,796
How's the collaboration
with the charity app going?

92
00:08:22,796 --> 00:08:26,316
- It's proceeding as usual.
- What do you mean, as usual?

93
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:30,496
- I'm serious. Be more serious.
- I am quite serious.

94
00:08:30,496 --> 00:08:35,115
Don't you never care about such things?
You always leave it to me.

95
00:08:39,316 --> 00:08:42,775
But this time, it's important.
Our 10th-anniversary celebration.

96
00:08:42,775 --> 00:08:45,796
So, it's proceeding as usual.
You don't have to worry about it.

97
00:08:51,595 --> 00:08:53,076
- Let me see.
- One is missing.

98
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,156
I have an idea.

99
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:03,755
Go ahead.

100
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,156
How long has it been
since we last saw Zhu?

101
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,995
It's been quite a while.
What has he been up to?

102
00:09:11,995 --> 00:09:15,896
He wants to do a large dubbing drama
in Guilin for May Day.

103
00:09:15,896 --> 00:09:18,076
He just learned about
our 10th-anniversary celebration.

104
00:09:18,076 --> 00:09:21,715
I was thinking about taking advantage
of that to gather around.

105
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:27,076
I've never been there. And indeed,
it's been a long time since we saw Zhu.

106
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:30,755
Right? Our team-building activity
this year isn't settled yet, is it?

107
00:09:30,755 --> 00:09:34,512
The dubbing drama, our 10th anniversary
and the charity app project.

108
00:09:34,512 --> 00:09:37,956
Multiple tasks will be achieved at once.
What do you think?

109
00:09:37,956 --> 00:09:39,935
- That's perfect.
- Great, right?

110
00:09:39,935 --> 00:09:42,076
I'll discuss it
with Geng Xiaoxing tomorrow.

111
00:09:45,595 --> 00:09:49,196
Yes, you need to. It's a big deal.
Have a good talk, face-to-face with her.

112
00:09:51,595 --> 00:09:54,316
But my schedule is full tomorrow.
I might not have time to go to school.

113
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:59,616
But you can invite her
to our recording studio, right?

114
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:01,095
Let's talk in the recording studio.

115
00:10:01,095 --> 00:10:03,916
The partner hasn't even seen
our recording studio. It's not right.

116
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:06,755
Makes sense.

117
00:10:08,635 --> 00:10:12,955
Let's tidy up our place tomorrow
and arrange for afternoon tea.

118
00:10:14,235 --> 00:10:16,895
Clean it thoroughly

119
00:10:16,895 --> 00:10:20,956
- since the partner will come. Got it?
- Yes. And when?

120
00:10:20,956 --> 00:10:25,835
At 3 PM tomorrow. I'm available
at 3 PM. Let's talk at that time, okay?

121
00:10:27,635 --> 00:10:30,516
- Okay.
- That's settled then.

122
00:10:30,516 --> 00:10:31,796
At 3 PM tomorrow.

123
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:54,556
- You're back. Was it crowded?
- Not at all. Hurry over.

124
00:10:54,556 --> 00:10:56,235
Alright, I'll go after washing my socks.

125
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:11,675
- Hello, Doudou.
- It's me. About our cooperation.

126
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:13,235
There's some great news now.

127
00:11:14,595 --> 00:11:17,876
- What good news?
- I'll keep you in suspense for now.

128
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:23,516
Are you free at 3 PM tomorrow? I'd like
to invite you over for afternoon tea.

129
00:11:25,595 --> 00:11:29,755
- Sure. I won't have class.
- I'll be waiting for you with Juemei.

130
00:11:32,115 --> 00:11:35,276
- Okay, see you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

131
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:38,196
Okay, see you tomorrow.

132
00:11:44,196 --> 00:11:47,115
- I've made an appointment.
- Have you?

133
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:51,076
You have. Good. That was quick.

134
00:12:04,196 --> 00:12:08,396
Where are you going to hang this pair
of jeans? So heavy. Can it sustain this?

135
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:09,436
Right.

136
00:12:12,436 --> 00:12:13,316
I'll hang it with this.

137
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:47,235
Doudou, there's someone at the door.

138
00:12:58,355 --> 00:12:59,156
Xiaoxing.

139
00:13:00,715 --> 00:13:02,636
- Doudou.
- It's me.

140
00:13:02,636 --> 00:13:06,376
I finally see you in person. I only saw
your photos on WeChat Moments before.

141
00:13:06,376 --> 00:13:07,676
Hurry in.

142
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:13,076
Juemei is dubbing inside.
Do you want to have a look?

143
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:16,896
L-L-Look at what?

144
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:20,715
It's your first time here. Don't you
want to see him dubbing in person?

145
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:24,115
- Sure.
- Let's go.

146
00:13:29,036 --> 00:13:31,735
- In the stillness of the night,
- Hold on a second. Almost done.

147
00:13:31,735 --> 00:13:34,288
he looked at the pale moon
in the clouds,

148
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,595
thinking the dawn was near.

149
00:13:59,156 --> 00:14:05,295
- Mao, last section. Almost 3 PM now.
- You get ready. Let's do it anytime.

150
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:06,635
He can't see us.

151
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:12,336
The client wants us to dub
some behind-the-scenes footage.

152
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:17,595
He insists on backlight.
Now he can only see his reflection.

153
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,264
I see.

154
00:14:24,436 --> 00:14:30,736
When he opened his eyes, the red door
was open. No one was outside,

155
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:36,036
yet there lingered the bustling aura
of a vibrant morning.

156
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:41,196
Deep in the blooming flowers,
his world was full of life.

157
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:46,235
How's it?

158
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:49,956
I think it's alright. It's 3 PM.

159
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:53,476
- I think there are no problems.
- Great, then there are no problems.

160
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,456
The lighting today looks pretty good.

161
00:14:56,456 --> 00:15:00,676
Look at me. Don't I look
unusually handsome today?

162
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:05,476
- Narcissist.
- You're the most handsome guy.

163
00:15:05,476 --> 00:15:09,876
- Take some pictures for me. Come on.
- Take them yourself.

164
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:12,115
Hurry up. I seldom take pictures.

165
00:15:13,196 --> 00:15:14,036
I'll take a few selfies.

166
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:19,516
- Okay. Did Geng Xiaoxing come?
- I...

167
00:15:19,516 --> 00:15:20,996
Be quiet. Sit down.

168
00:15:20,996 --> 00:15:23,475
- Geng Xiaoxing? Which Xiaoxing?
- Stay quiet.

169
00:15:26,076 --> 00:15:31,696
No, not yet. Is she lost?
Why don't you pick her up?

170
00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:34,796
Wait, didn't I tell you to call
and ask her? Didn't you call?

171
00:15:36,516 --> 00:15:41,755
- I don't know her well. I forgot.
- What? How do you manage your task?

172
00:15:43,196 --> 00:15:47,396
What's with that girl? What time is it?
She's late on her first day.

173
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:52,755
- So, what shall I say later?
- Just tease him.

174
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,995
I entrusted you
with such a trivial matter...

175
00:16:07,196 --> 00:16:08,396
When did you get here?

176
00:16:10,796 --> 00:16:12,396
I just got here.

177
00:16:19,556 --> 00:16:20,396
Long time no see.

178
00:16:21,835 --> 00:16:22,995
Long time no see.

179
00:16:26,355 --> 00:16:30,835
- How have you been doing recently?
- I'm doing fine. How about you?

180
00:16:33,276 --> 00:16:34,156
I'm doing fine as well.

181
00:16:35,475 --> 00:16:38,215
That's good.

182
00:16:38,608 --> 00:16:42,675
Excuse me for interrupting.
Are you reading from a script?

183
00:16:42,675 --> 00:16:46,556
Mr. Juemei, the recording is over.
You don't have to play the character.

184
00:16:48,076 --> 00:16:49,264
W-W-Why are you laughing?

185
00:16:49,936 --> 00:16:52,875
Check the last two sections just now.
I think they're both good.

186
00:16:53,995 --> 00:16:55,396
The penultimate one, alright?

187
00:16:55,396 --> 00:16:58,156
- You can just send it to the client.
- Okay.

188
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:03,955
Well,

189
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:07,195
shall we talk outside then?

190
00:17:09,276 --> 00:17:11,835
- Okay, let's go out then.
- Okay.

191
00:17:20,395 --> 00:17:23,595
- Doudou.
- You guys go ahead. I need to rehearse.

192
00:17:25,556 --> 00:17:26,155
Go ahead.

193
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,076
Would you like some fruit?

194
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:41,036
No, thank you.

195
00:17:50,595 --> 00:17:54,635
Did Doudou tell you
what she was gonna discuss with you?

196
00:17:55,835 --> 00:17:59,236
No, but she said it was good news.

197
00:18:00,316 --> 00:18:01,435
It's indeed good news.

198
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:14,996
- You were amazing just now.
- Thank you.

199
00:18:14,996 --> 00:18:20,796
I've listened to your works before.
This time, I got to listen to it live.

200
00:18:22,395 --> 00:18:25,635
- You've even listened to my works?
- Of course.

201
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:33,275
- Weren't you green about our biz?
- I was in the past.

202
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:37,576
But my roommates, Sheng and Qi Yao,

203
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:39,195
really like you guys.

204
00:18:41,716 --> 00:18:47,195
Since we need to collaborate,
so I listened to a lot of your works.

205
00:18:52,155 --> 00:18:53,115
Thanks for your attention.

206
00:18:57,915 --> 00:19:02,536
Didn't you two communicate before?
Why are you still so polite now?

207
00:19:02,536 --> 00:19:07,476
Juemei, are you being too serious?
Aren't you usually quite casual?

208
00:19:07,476 --> 00:19:13,276
- This is business. What do you know?
- What business? That's not our style.

209
00:19:13,276 --> 00:19:17,476
Moreover, we'll travel to Guilin later
as good friends, won't we?

210
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:20,115
Guilin?

211
00:19:24,835 --> 00:19:29,135
Let's talk about it later.
Can you bring the afternoon tea, Xiyou?

212
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:29,556
Okay.

213
00:19:33,316 --> 00:19:35,155
- Thanks. Get back to your work.
- Okay.

214
00:19:36,716 --> 00:19:38,236
How about this? It looks pretty good.

215
00:19:40,595 --> 00:19:42,236
- Here.
- Thank you.

216
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:50,756
Yummy.

217
00:19:53,635 --> 00:19:58,296
- Doudou, why are we going to Guilin?
- This is a surprise bonus.

218
00:19:58,296 --> 00:20:02,915
I discussed it with Juemei yesterday,
and I want to discuss it with you today.

219
00:20:04,395 --> 00:20:10,216
- We want to celebrate in Guilin.
- To be precise, in Yangshuo, Guilin.

220
00:20:10,216 --> 00:20:12,355
So we want to ask
if you have any opinions.

221
00:20:14,476 --> 00:20:20,595
I-I-I obviously have no objections.
But who is going to pay?

222
00:20:22,036 --> 00:20:23,076
About the money...

223
00:20:24,476 --> 00:20:26,316
I didn't mean it that way, Doudou.

224
00:20:28,236 --> 00:20:34,316
Our app is charitable. The production
and operation all rely on donations.

225
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:41,156
We don't get paid, so we don't have
money to go to Yangshuo.

226
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:47,135
The flights and accommodation
will cost money, so...

227
00:20:47,135 --> 00:20:51,456
No need to worry because this time,
we're invited by the organizer

228
00:20:51,456 --> 00:20:56,656
who is our friend. He wants to record
a big dubbing drama in Yangshuo.

229
00:20:56,656 --> 00:21:00,556
We'll take advantage of it to hold
our 10th-anniversary celebration.

230
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:05,476
By the way, every year, we have
a long-standing employee bonus

231
00:21:05,476 --> 00:21:08,296
where we all go on a trip, right?

232
00:21:08,296 --> 00:21:13,856
We'll cover all the costs of your trip
to Yangshuo with your buddies.

233
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,076
No, this is too much.

234
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:19,255
- Doudou, I think we...
- It's okay.

235
00:21:19,255 --> 00:21:24,596
We're given three family member spots,
and Sheng will take one.

236
00:21:24,596 --> 00:21:27,396
- There are two more. You're in.
- Yes, yes.

237
00:21:27,396 --> 00:21:32,115
- As your family member.
- No. You make it sound like

238
00:21:32,115 --> 00:21:35,956
- I'm taking advantage of her.
- Just a name in theory.

239
00:21:35,956 --> 00:21:39,196
We'll eat to our hearts' content
and make the most of this opportunity.

240
00:21:39,196 --> 00:21:41,915
Right. Eat and drink whatever you want.

241
00:21:44,996 --> 00:21:49,520
Doudou, I think
I will participate remotely.

242
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:53,236
It won't cost anything
and will save everyone's money.

243
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:54,956
Can I?

244
00:22:01,476 --> 00:22:07,476
Don't hesitate anymore,
Xiaoxing. Xingfu, it's settled.

245
00:22:08,756 --> 00:22:13,395
- We'll meet in Yangshuo on May Day.
- Yangshuo?

246
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:18,216
- You must be joking.
- Going to Yangshuo for an event?

247
00:22:18,216 --> 00:22:22,796
- Right. We're going to Yangshuo.
- Your event seems to be getting bigger.

248
00:22:23,835 --> 00:22:27,355
Are you kidding me? You all forgot about
the dubbing drama scheduled this year?

249
00:22:28,635 --> 00:22:30,556
Isn't it supposed to be held nearby?

250
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,872
Memories of Jiangnan
[*Regions south of the Yangtze River]

251
00:22:34,316 --> 00:22:38,596
- Some place by the river in Jiangnan.
- That's what I remember, too.

252
00:22:38,596 --> 00:22:41,072
From the start till now, how many
different versions have there been?

253
00:22:42,192 --> 00:22:46,875
You've been too busy with work,
so I didn't update you on the progress.

254
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:47,675
Right, Doudou?

255
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,064
(About this drama)
What about Feng Yasong?

256
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,156
I asked him. He can switch shifts.

257
00:22:53,156 --> 00:22:58,775
Zhou Zheng reminded me this time.
Didn't we say to travel this spring?

258
00:22:58,775 --> 00:23:02,796
Because you and Feng Yasong
have been busy, it's delayed until now.

259
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:07,296
- Exactly.
- Luckily, the sponsor is generous

260
00:23:07,296 --> 00:23:09,456
and will help us with our trip.

261
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:12,996
It doesn't seem right.
The budget for this event is very tight.

262
00:23:12,996 --> 00:23:16,276
- Both you and I are like volunteers.
- That's what I thought too.

263
00:23:16,276 --> 00:23:21,116
But Doudou was so enthusiastic. They
happen to have a project in Yangshuo.

264
00:23:21,116 --> 00:23:26,435
They're going on a team-building trip,
so they will cover our travel expenses.

265
00:23:26,435 --> 00:23:28,016
It'll be fun with a lot of people.

266
00:23:29,072 --> 00:23:33,476
- Feels like something's off.
- It's not right.

267
00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:38,856
Don't look at me. We decided this
together, right, Doudou?

268
00:23:38,856 --> 00:23:42,515
We saw that everyone
had been working hard recently,

269
00:23:42,515 --> 00:23:44,848
so I was looking for an opportunity
for us to go out together.

270
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,456
- To have a rest.
- Yeah, to have a rest.

271
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:51,836
- We all need to rest.
- Okay, I have no objections.

272
00:23:51,836 --> 00:23:55,456
Then I'll adjust my schedule
to cooperate with you.

273
00:23:55,456 --> 00:23:59,595
- How can you say you are cooperating?
- You don't want my cooperation?

274
00:24:01,456 --> 00:24:02,960
Now that I think about it, I...

275
00:24:04,144 --> 00:24:09,416
Sacrificing my weekends for months
for a holiday is not worth it.

276
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:13,796
- Or maybe I should not go.
- No, you must come.

277
00:24:13,796 --> 00:24:16,816
Please cooperate. Consider it
a favor for me, okay?

278
00:24:16,816 --> 00:24:20,515
The furthest I've traveled
is within the free shipping zone.

279
00:24:20,515 --> 00:24:26,396
- I've never flown that far before.
- The furthest I've been is Suzhou.

280
00:24:26,396 --> 00:24:32,776
One real and one fake family member
will travel together. So enviable.

281
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:39,115
- It's all for work.
- So it's your first trip together.

282
00:24:44,835 --> 00:24:45,615
Sheng,

283
00:24:45,615 --> 00:24:49,915
I know for your first trip out with him,
you must dress well. I will help you.

284
00:24:52,635 --> 00:24:53,276
What's wrong?

285
00:24:54,675 --> 00:24:59,356
I'm not sure how to tell my family.
What if they don't agree?

286
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:06,176
If you are going this time, it'll be
your first trip with Shengshengman.

287
00:25:06,176 --> 00:25:07,716
Really? The first time?

288
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:17,476
- Isn't it for work?
- Yes, but it's different for you.

289
00:25:19,856 --> 00:25:22,155
Okay, I'll cooperate.

290
00:25:23,536 --> 00:25:28,996
Now, look at Mr. Mo. He kept making me
ask him and persuade him.

291
00:25:28,996 --> 00:25:32,556
At last, it was his own idea, wasn't it?

292
00:25:32,556 --> 00:25:35,416
Well, why don't you guys go?

293
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:39,756
I can take advantage of this holiday
to go on a trip with her alone, right?

294
00:25:39,756 --> 00:25:42,096
- You know I never go to offline events.
- Exactly.

295
00:25:42,096 --> 00:25:44,596
We can just video call each other then.

296
00:25:44,596 --> 00:25:48,716
- That's settled then.
- You can't leave. You have to go.

297
00:25:48,716 --> 00:25:51,115
Sorry, my stupid mouth is to blame.

298
00:25:51,115 --> 00:25:52,716
- Keep it up.
- You can't leave.

299
00:25:52,716 --> 00:25:54,756
-Doudou
-Exactly. You're so annoying.

300
00:25:54,756 --> 00:25:56,916
All the nonsense
and you can't even win against him.

301
00:25:56,916 --> 00:26:01,696
But, Mr. Mo, we really do have
a lot to deal with this time.

302
00:26:01,696 --> 00:26:06,356
Booking plane tickets and hotels
and preparing for the 10th anniversary.

303
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,816
Won't it be better for me to make
arrangements if you decide asap?

304
00:26:09,155 --> 00:26:12,556
Yes. You have to go, Mo.
If you don't go, I won't go either.

305
00:26:12,556 --> 00:26:16,716
I beg you. If you don't say yes,
I won't let go.

306
00:26:16,716 --> 00:26:18,376
- If you don't go, I won't let go.
- Okay.

307
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:21,435
- Really? You're really going?
- Yes.

308
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:26,136
Finally. You tired me out.

309
00:26:26,136 --> 00:26:28,956
Alright, so it's decided. Dismissed.

310
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:33,376
- I disagree.
- I don't agree either.

311
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:37,415
You two young girls go out
with a company? It must be a scam.

312
00:26:37,415 --> 00:26:40,896
- Were you tricked by a shady company?
- Exactly.

313
00:26:40,896 --> 00:26:44,676
They are not schemers.
It's a well-known dubbing company.

314
00:26:44,676 --> 00:26:49,056
Yes. I can vouch for that. I'll go
as the representative of the company.

315
00:26:49,056 --> 00:26:51,036
Sheng is our planner.

316
00:26:51,036 --> 00:26:55,256
We're a legitimate company working
on a charitable app. Rest assured.

317
00:26:55,256 --> 00:26:58,396
- What's an app?
- But she is a planner...

318
00:26:58,396 --> 00:27:04,856
Alright, we are not exactly paranoid,
but it's your first time flying so far.

319
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:08,696
Even if they aren't scammers,
can you take care of yourselves?

320
00:27:08,696 --> 00:27:09,956
- Can you?
- Can you?

321
00:27:09,956 --> 00:27:13,635
How about this? I will ask for leave
from the team and accompany you two?

322
00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:16,236
- No need.
- Gentlemen.

323
00:27:16,236 --> 00:27:18,176
Sheng is about to apply
for postgraduate studies.

324
00:27:18,176 --> 00:27:22,556
She's at the legal age to get married.
You want to control her for a lifetime?

325
00:27:22,556 --> 00:27:24,796
- Eat your sunflower seeds.
- Exactly, Grandpa.

326
00:27:24,796 --> 00:27:28,875
Gu Jia, although the youngest,
is the most sensible.

327
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:33,436
Sheng, if not for graduate studies,
she would have started working.

328
00:27:33,436 --> 00:27:37,276
If she went on a business trip,
would you take leave to accompany her?

329
00:27:37,276 --> 00:27:38,516
- Would you?
- I...

330
00:27:39,756 --> 00:27:41,476
- It's too far.
- Grandpa.

331
00:27:41,476 --> 00:27:46,395
I have a friend in Guilin. I'll give him
a call to ask him to take care of her.

332
00:27:46,395 --> 00:27:50,195
- Good idea.
- I don't want it. Grandpa, look at him.

333
00:27:50,195 --> 00:27:52,976
What's wrong?
My buddy runs a travel agency.

334
00:27:52,976 --> 00:27:56,776
He has connections and vehicles.
I'll feel at ease if he accompanies you.

335
00:27:56,776 --> 00:28:01,155
- But I don't know him. Why should I?
- Once you go, you'll get to know him.

336
00:28:01,155 --> 00:28:02,976
- Right. With his company...
- I don't want to.

337
00:28:02,976 --> 00:28:06,936
It's natural to worry
when your younger cousin goes out.

338
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:11,515
- But don't push it. She's free to go.
- Right.

339
00:28:11,515 --> 00:28:14,435
- There are so many bad people nowadays.
- Yes.

340
00:28:14,435 --> 00:28:16,076
We're worried about the two young girls.

341
00:28:16,076 --> 00:28:17,956
- No way.
- It's too far, isn't it?

342
00:28:17,956 --> 00:28:20,915
- The world is a complex mix.
- Everyone.

343
00:28:22,115 --> 00:28:27,176
These are our contract
and the business license.

344
00:28:27,176 --> 00:28:30,875
This is our itinerary for Yangshuo,
including the hotel we'll be staying at.

345
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,835
It is all arranged in great detail.
You can take a look.

346
00:28:33,835 --> 00:28:36,036
- She can't go there.
- It's so detailed.

347
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:41,536
Sheng, if you want to visit Yangshuo,

348
00:28:41,536 --> 00:28:45,016
we can go as a family
during the National Day holidays.

349
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:48,376
- Exactly.
- Besides, she's the project leader,

350
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:51,375
and you're just a planner. No need
for you to tag along, right?

351
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:54,136
She doesn't know them.

352
00:28:54,136 --> 00:28:57,056
How boring it would be for her?
She'll have company if I go with her.

353
00:28:57,056 --> 00:28:58,776
- Isn't that okay? Can't I go?
- She's right.

354
00:28:58,776 --> 00:29:03,195
And I'm afraid of the dark
and sleeping alone. If she goes with me,

355
00:29:03,195 --> 00:29:04,895
we can look after each other, right?

356
00:29:04,895 --> 00:29:08,675
- It's not safe for you young girls.
- Hey, let's not discuss this anymore.

357
00:29:08,675 --> 00:29:11,956
- I agree to let Sheng go.
- Grandpa.

358
00:29:11,956 --> 00:29:15,595
- Thank you, Grandpa.
- I'll speak to your parents about it.

359
00:29:16,835 --> 00:29:20,976
- Let me have a look at that.
- Grandpa, thank you.

360
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:26,755
Impression Liu Sanjie. This is good.
I've been there with my old classmates.

361
00:29:26,755 --> 00:29:32,015
Look at these terraces.
They're beautiful. It's worth a visit.

362
00:29:32,015 --> 00:29:33,956
Got it, Grandpa. I will definitely go.

363
00:29:33,956 --> 00:29:35,756
- And...
- Anyway, I don't agree.

364
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,296
- Should I check the suitcase again?
- Isn't it unnecessary?

365
00:29:50,296 --> 00:29:52,195
You've checked it so many times.

366
00:30:02,516 --> 00:30:04,875
- Can you sleep?
- No.

367
00:30:06,516 --> 00:30:08,395
- I'm quite excited.
- I knew it.

368
00:30:11,036 --> 00:30:16,736
I just went through it in my mind.
When I first asked for your help,

369
00:30:16,736 --> 00:30:21,676
I didn't even know what the dubbing
and the traditional music circles were.

370
00:30:21,676 --> 00:30:25,756
And now I'm actually going
to the celebration in Yangshuo.

371
00:30:30,115 --> 00:30:31,516
It was before the Spring Festival,
right?

372
00:30:35,024 --> 00:30:37,716
Right, before the Spring Festival.

373
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:41,996
At that time,

374
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:46,635
I didn't even know him.

375
00:30:48,915 --> 00:30:51,835
Now you've started
to miss him, Gu Sheng.

376
00:30:54,476 --> 00:30:58,375
Why haven't you two girls gone to sleep?
Isn't the flight early tomorrow?

377
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:01,395
- We are going to sleep, Grandpa.
- Alright.

378
00:31:01,395 --> 00:31:02,696
- It's okay?
- It's fine.

379
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:04,395
My grandpa's hearing is really sharp.

380
00:31:13,155 --> 00:31:16,076
Playing guitar this late.
How can you bear it?

381
00:31:17,195 --> 00:31:20,056
A guy in the neighborhood got dumped.

382
00:31:20,056 --> 00:31:23,236
He sent a fruit basket
to every household around us.

383
00:31:23,236 --> 00:31:26,128
He said he needed three days' rest
and asked for our understanding.

384
00:31:27,312 --> 00:31:30,595
Poor thing. He's heartbroken.
It's okay. It'll stop soon.

385
00:31:32,076 --> 00:31:33,195
A person worthy of pity.

386
00:31:34,316 --> 00:31:37,635
But this song
is actually quite pleasant to the ears.

387
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:43,655
Do you think it's possible
that he will compose a masterpiece

388
00:31:43,655 --> 00:31:46,636
and from then on become famous
and reach the pinnacle of life?

389
00:31:46,636 --> 00:31:49,675
Can't you have some sympathy?
He's heartbroken.

390
00:31:54,236 --> 00:31:59,135
- If you're dumped, I'll write for you.
- I won't ever get dumped.

391
00:31:59,135 --> 00:32:04,675
But, may your heart never be broken
and may you and Mo always be together.

392
00:32:08,155 --> 00:32:10,476
Being in love is really wonderful.

393
00:32:42,224 --> 00:32:44,784
(Guilin)

394
00:32:45,395 --> 00:32:48,636
Let's head outside. Zhu said
he'll be waiting in the parking lot.

395
00:32:48,636 --> 00:32:49,276
- Alright.
- Okay.

396
00:32:50,796 --> 00:32:51,956
Did you sleep well last night?

397
00:32:53,036 --> 00:32:56,395
- I was too excited and couldn't sleep.
- No wonder you just kept dozing off.

398
00:33:02,076 --> 00:33:05,195
He said to meet in the parking lot.
We should probably head that way.

399
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:13,596
- Long time no see.
- You've lost weight.

400
00:33:13,596 --> 00:33:14,355
Not bad.

401
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:20,016
- You guys kept me up last night.
- Stop it, will you?

402
00:33:20,016 --> 00:33:23,196
- Wasn't it because you were lovelorn?
- Don't say it out loud.

403
00:33:23,196 --> 00:33:25,236
- He's right.
- Qiang Qingci.

404
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:28,855
You've been so elusive these years.
I thought you were going to quit again.

405
00:33:28,855 --> 00:33:30,276
I have really been too busy with work.

406
00:33:31,556 --> 00:33:37,156
Work and life should be well balanced.
Isn't that what you taught me?

407
00:33:37,156 --> 00:33:41,556
This is my girlfriend Gu Sheng,
and her classmate, Geng Xiaoxing.

408
00:33:41,556 --> 00:33:43,395
Hi, I'm Geng Xiaoxing.

409
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:51,675
Shengshengman, right?

410
00:33:53,635 --> 00:33:57,716
- Hello, just call me Sheng.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

411
00:33:57,716 --> 00:34:00,716
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm happier to meet you.

412
00:34:00,716 --> 00:34:02,675
I've been following her
for several months.

413
00:34:02,675 --> 00:34:05,716
I was wondering what she was like,
and today I finally see her in person.

414
00:34:05,716 --> 00:34:12,195
Sometimes he'd secretly ask me
whether Qiang Qingci could win her over.

415
00:34:12,195 --> 00:34:15,616
I was so anxious. I was afraid
he couldn't make it work.

416
00:34:15,616 --> 00:34:20,256
Zhu, let's save
the pleasantries for later.

417
00:34:20,256 --> 00:34:22,235
- Shall we get on the bus first?
- Right, it's so hot.

418
00:34:22,235 --> 00:34:25,056
Right. I can't have you big stars
wasting time at the airport entrance.

419
00:34:25,056 --> 00:34:27,595
- Get on the bus to go for lunch.
- Let's go.

420
00:34:27,595 --> 00:34:29,836
- There will be two mysterious guests.
- Mysterious guests?

421
00:34:29,836 --> 00:34:31,396
You'll know when you see them. Let's go.

422
00:34:31,396 --> 00:34:33,036
- Do you know who they are?
- No idea.

423
00:34:34,755 --> 00:34:36,596
- Who are they?
- Right here.

424
00:34:36,596 --> 00:34:37,556
Li.

425
00:34:38,635 --> 00:34:39,675
Can all these fit in?

426
00:34:40,916 --> 00:34:42,175
Probably not.

427
00:34:42,175 --> 00:34:44,416
- Then we will carry ours inside.
- Okay.

428
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,076
- This way.
- How come I haven't seen Mao?

429
00:34:47,076 --> 00:34:51,455
- He will arrive in a few days.
- Let me see who they are.

430
00:34:51,455 --> 00:34:52,235
This one.

431
00:34:53,996 --> 00:34:58,275
- Mu, Mo Bai, it's been a while.
- We've waited for an hour already.

432
00:34:59,715 --> 00:35:02,796
- Where are the others from your club?
- They left already.

433
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:06,116
We couldn't fit anymore,
so we two old folks offered our seats.

434
00:35:06,116 --> 00:35:09,656
You insisted on staying when you heard
Qiang Qingci was coming.

435
00:35:09,656 --> 00:35:13,056
Could you please speak with reserve?

436
00:35:13,056 --> 00:35:14,846
It's you two. I was wondering.

437
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,315
- Doudou.
- Long time no see.

438
00:35:16,315 --> 00:35:18,536
- Feng Yasong.
- A new friend, Geng Xiaoxing.

439
00:35:18,536 --> 00:35:21,195
- Sit here. The view is good.
- Okay.

440
00:35:22,795 --> 00:35:24,536
- Mo Bai.
- Mu.

441
00:35:24,536 --> 00:35:26,536
- My name's Xiaoxing.
- Get a seat.

442
00:35:26,536 --> 00:35:29,196
- Do you want to have chicken feet?
- No, thank you.

443
00:35:29,196 --> 00:35:30,635
- Pass me that. Come on.
- Here.

444
00:35:33,635 --> 00:35:34,155
Shengshengman.

445
00:35:35,755 --> 00:35:36,396
It's you guys.

446
00:35:39,235 --> 00:35:43,616
- Do you prefer the front or the back?
- In the front, the view is better.

447
00:35:43,616 --> 00:35:48,436
The back. You can see the scenery
and what those in the front are doing.

448
00:35:48,436 --> 00:35:49,676
And I have lots of snacks here.

449
00:35:49,676 --> 00:35:52,976
It's been long since I last saw
Qiang Qingci. So bad of you.

450
00:35:52,976 --> 00:35:55,936
Do you think I can see him often?
He doesn't go anywhere these years.

451
00:35:55,936 --> 00:36:00,356
- Didn't you see him two months ago?
- Stop talking nonsense.

452
00:36:00,356 --> 00:36:02,936
You need to break your lying habit.

453
00:36:02,936 --> 00:36:07,235
- How about we let Sheng choose?
- You choose. No pressure.

454
00:36:09,076 --> 00:36:09,916
It's both the same to me.

455
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:14,036
The back can be a bit bumpy
when the bus is moving. Let's sit here.

456
00:36:15,996 --> 00:36:17,315
Good choice.

457
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:23,755
- Juemei.
- I knew it's you two.

458
00:36:30,635 --> 00:36:32,315
Can I sit here?

459
00:36:47,115 --> 00:36:47,916
Everyone's here, right?

460
00:36:49,396 --> 00:36:49,876
Let's roll.

461
00:37:14,836 --> 00:37:15,516
Your seat belt.

462
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:31,275
Love is knocking at Juemei's door.

463
00:37:38,795 --> 00:37:40,076
I must not alert him.

464
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:53,816
Sheng, it's your first time in Guilin.
I'll give you a proper introduction.

465
00:37:53,816 --> 00:37:56,536
Do you know why it's called Guilin?
It's because of the osmanthus trees.

466
00:37:56,536 --> 00:38:00,836
Every year during the flowering season,
the fragrance fills everywhere.

467
00:38:00,836 --> 00:38:02,136
Its scent is indescribable.

468
00:38:02,136 --> 00:38:05,635
- Can't we see them now?
- No. But that's okay.

469
00:38:07,275 --> 00:38:09,856
There are various beverages
and foods made from osmanthus flowers.

470
00:38:09,856 --> 00:38:13,776
- I'll give some to you all.
- Thank you.

471
00:38:13,936 --> 00:38:18,796
Zhu, you only talk to them as if
we weren't here. We want to hear too.

472
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,195
I'm speaking loudly to everyone.

473
00:38:21,195 --> 00:38:23,556
- Who's speaking now?
- We can't hear you.

474
00:38:24,715 --> 00:38:26,796
Fine.

475
00:38:26,796 --> 00:38:33,396
Esteemed figures from the dubbing
and traditional music industry.

476
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:37,435
And the two well-known cosers,

477
00:38:37,435 --> 00:38:39,396
welcome to Guilin.

478
00:38:39,396 --> 00:38:44,356
For the next few days, I will be
your private tour guide. Thank you.

479
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:45,896
-Well said.
-Well said. Brilliant.

480
00:38:45,896 --> 00:38:46,916
I'm so honored.

481
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:51,476
- So touching.
- Your eyes are closed. Not sincere.

482
00:38:51,476 --> 00:38:54,275
Can you be serious? You haven't uttered
a single serious word till now.

483
00:38:54,275 --> 00:38:59,816
Sir, can we change the tour guide?
I'll pay more for a professional one.

484
00:38:59,816 --> 00:39:04,416
- Agreed.
- Buzzcut, you are so arrogant.

485
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:07,896
- I hired him. Who do you wanna replace?
- You.

486
00:39:07,896 --> 00:39:11,115
- Li, eject him from the seat.
- I fastened my seatbelt, so you can't.

487
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:14,036
Fight! Choose violence.
Don't use your words.

488
00:39:15,155 --> 00:39:16,956
Are they too loud?
I'll ask them to keep it down.

489
00:39:17,936 --> 00:39:19,795
No need. It's quite fun.

490
00:39:21,715 --> 00:39:24,915
- Your friends are so interesting.
- Just seemingly.

491
00:39:24,915 --> 00:39:27,115
Don't bother with them.
Few of them are serious people.

492
00:39:30,195 --> 00:39:34,715
Look. I do feel like
they don't want to talk to me.

493
00:39:35,795 --> 00:39:41,235
Mo Bai, let's switch seats. I just
got dumped. Seeing couples is painful.

494
00:39:41,235 --> 00:39:43,156
Now you remember me?

495
00:39:43,156 --> 00:39:46,336
Enough with the jokes. Can you
take your job as a tour guide seriously?

496
00:39:46,336 --> 00:39:49,036
Fine, I'll behave. I am a tour guide.

497
00:39:49,036 --> 00:39:52,715
Everyone, our destination
for this trip is Yangshuo.

498
00:39:54,155 --> 00:39:58,356
You must have heard of this.
Guilin landscape tops those elsewhere.

499
00:39:59,675 --> 00:40:05,195
But there's a follow-up to that saying.
Yangshuo landscape tops that of Guilin.

500
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:08,755
- Good poem.
- Good.

501
00:40:27,516 --> 00:40:28,635
- Good.
- Right here.

502
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,956
- We've arrived.
- It'll be a while before we get on board.

503
00:40:30,956 --> 00:40:33,556
Let's have lunch during this time.
There are many restaurants over there.

504
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,876
- OK.
- Let's go.

505
00:40:34,876 --> 00:40:36,256
Let's get off.

506
00:40:36,256 --> 00:40:39,016
- I'm starving.
- Let's go.

507
00:40:39,016 --> 00:40:40,315
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

508
00:40:41,635 --> 00:40:44,376
What's your local specialty here?
What do you all like to eat?

509
00:40:44,376 --> 00:40:45,520
Bamboo shoots.

510
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,755
- In Guilin rice noodles?
- Correct.

511
00:40:47,755 --> 00:40:50,356
- And in river snails rice noodles too.
- Correct.

512
00:40:50,356 --> 00:40:54,155
Lunar March is the month for cherries
and bamboo shoots. We're just in time.

513
00:40:55,516 --> 00:40:58,036
Shall we have rice noodles
at that restaurant over there?

514
00:40:58,036 --> 00:40:58,996
- OK.
- Sure.

515
00:40:58,996 --> 00:40:59,856
- Let's go.
- Go.

516
00:40:59,856 --> 00:41:02,216
- Let's go.
- We're going to have rice noodles.

517
00:41:02,216 --> 00:41:08,576
You can add any side dishes. I guess
you'd choose pig's knuckles.

518
00:41:08,576 --> 00:41:13,676
You make me sound like a foodie.
But I really do want to eat them.

519
00:41:13,676 --> 00:41:17,676
- But won't it leave an odor?
- I have a solution, don't worry.

520
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:23,376
Come on. Juemei drives me out every time
I eat river snails rice noodles.

521
00:41:23,376 --> 00:41:26,876
Have everyone eat it together.
Then we will all be stinky.

522
00:41:26,876 --> 00:41:29,996
- Can that be a solution?
- You can eat Guilin rice noodles.

523
00:41:29,996 --> 00:41:32,916
- You must try it or it will be a pity.
- Right.

524
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:33,486
Right.

525
00:41:33,486 --> 00:41:34,556
- Let's go.
- Go.

526
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:53,675
Here are Guilin rice noodles.

527
00:41:57,795 --> 00:42:01,036
- Sir, your rice noodles smell good.
- Thank you.

528
00:42:02,115 --> 00:42:05,076
- Thank you, sir.
- I've never had rice noodles in sauce.

529
00:42:05,076 --> 00:42:08,155
Authentic Guilin rice noodles
are all in sauce.

530
00:42:08,155 --> 00:42:10,255
- Are they?
- Bro, you should take a break.

531
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:16,495
- Let Mr. Mo explain it with feelings.
- Make it sound like a food show.

532
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:19,136
The essence of Guilin rice noodles
is their marinade.

533
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:22,336
So to fully taste this marinade,

534
00:42:22,336 --> 00:42:23,896
I recommend you eat it without soup.

535
00:42:23,896 --> 00:42:28,096
There's another authentic way to eat it.
To taste both flavors.

536
00:42:28,096 --> 00:42:32,375
First, eat it without soup. When you are
almost done, add the bone soup.

537
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:34,156
- Right.
- You really know how to eat.

538
00:42:34,156 --> 00:42:36,275
- Oh, no. I already added my soup.
- Eat a piece of meat.

539
00:42:40,396 --> 00:42:42,275
- Is it good?
- Yes.

540
00:42:42,275 --> 00:42:45,795
The duck feet in your bowl
look pretty good.

541
00:42:54,315 --> 00:42:58,975
- Where is he going?
- Probably to get some chili oil.

542
00:42:58,975 --> 00:43:03,876
It's not spicy enough?
My tears are even coming out.

543
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:05,436
Then you should eat slower.

544
00:43:10,476 --> 00:43:12,396
It's spicy, but indeed
the taste is superb.

545
00:43:13,436 --> 00:43:15,795
- Where have the two of them gone?
- Eat these.

546
00:43:18,704 --> 00:43:19,675
This is good.

547
00:43:23,795 --> 00:43:25,755
- Mo sure knows how to eat.
- Definitely.

548
00:43:25,755 --> 00:43:26,320
Thank you.

549
00:43:27,235 --> 00:43:30,356
If any of you find it too spicy,
add some vinegar to neutralize it.

550
00:43:30,356 --> 00:43:33,235
I just heard you say it was spicy.
Let me add some for you.

551
00:43:34,876 --> 00:43:35,795
Okay, thanks.

552
00:43:37,076 --> 00:43:38,795
- Okay?
- That's enough.Thanks.
