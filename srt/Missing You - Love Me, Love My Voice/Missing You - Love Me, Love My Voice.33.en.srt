25
00:01:41,994 --> 00:01:45,933
(If you don't mind, we'll take
the wedding photos here.)

26
00:01:46,996 --> 00:01:49,036
Sir, madam,
where should I put your suitcase?

27
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:50,276
- Put it there. Thanks.
- Okay.

28
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,036
Give it to me.

29
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:53,155
Call me if you're in need.

30
00:01:54,116 --> 00:01:58,075
- Then I'll put it inside.
- Mr. Mo, as you asked,

31
00:01:58,196 --> 00:02:01,795
I've had the girl's clothes ironed.
Your suit will be delivered shortly.

32
00:02:02,075 --> 00:02:04,756
- Thank you.
- Wishing you a happy wedding.

33
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:17,435
Have a look.

34
00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:46,356
The view of Guilin is good.

35
00:02:47,595 --> 00:02:48,396
If you don't mind,

36
00:02:50,276 --> 00:02:51,516
we'll take the wedding photos here.

37
00:02:58,635 --> 00:02:59,956
It took quite a long time to choose.

38
00:03:01,356 --> 00:03:02,676
I asked your best friends around you.

39
00:03:03,796 --> 00:03:04,875
Based on everyone's opinions.

40
00:03:09,195 --> 00:03:10,705
No need to be too nervous.

41
00:03:10,705 --> 00:03:13,956
This isn't a wedding dress.
It's just for taking pictures.

42
00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:18,116
As for the formal dress,
you'll choose it yourself.

43
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,356
And I especially chose today.

44
00:03:25,595 --> 00:03:26,996
It's memorable for you.

45
00:03:30,516 --> 00:03:31,116
Happy graduation.

46
00:03:47,516 --> 00:03:48,236
But

47
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:54,276
I'm too shy to take pictures
in front of so many people,

48
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:56,315
especially of this kind.

49
00:04:00,276 --> 00:04:00,996
They don't know.

50
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:03,635
They don't know?

51
00:04:05,956 --> 00:04:06,915
Thinking you'd feel uneasy,

52
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,416
I just told them I wanted
to pick out a formal dress for you

53
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,435
and didn't mention
this outdoor shoot in Yangshuo.

54
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:18,556
Then we...

55
00:04:20,236 --> 00:04:20,835
Secretly.

56
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:41,036
- Still the same.
- Right.

57
00:04:44,755 --> 00:04:47,195
- You two finally arrived.
- Long time no see.

58
00:04:47,195 --> 00:04:50,036
I've been by the water all afternoon,
just watching the sun.

59
00:04:50,116 --> 00:04:52,596
I was afraid it would set too soon
and it'd miss your shoot.

60
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:54,556
Your boyfriend has really good taste,

61
00:04:54,556 --> 00:04:56,716
choosing Yangshuo as the place
for the wedding photos.

62
00:04:57,356 --> 00:04:58,835
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

63
00:04:59,195 --> 00:05:02,045
I love any happy occasion,
sharing happiness.

64
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:02,755
Mr. Qiang.

65
00:05:04,116 --> 00:05:07,075
- You're here.
- Those two say they are your friends.

66
00:05:07,075 --> 00:05:07,716
Yes, they are.

67
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,075
Do you remember me?

68
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,275
You were the photographer
on the 10th anniversary two years ago.

69
00:05:18,395 --> 00:05:21,635
You remember me. I didn't
come all the way from downtown in vain.

70
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:24,676
- I'll leave you guys to chat.
- Okay.

71
00:05:25,796 --> 00:05:27,835
As for me, I'm a stranger to you.

72
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:29,796
A nobody in the Perfect Voice Studio
in the past.

73
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,116
- I'll do your makeup styling today.
- Hello.

74
00:05:34,315 --> 00:05:38,195
- I finally held Mr. Qiang's girlfriend.
- Be reserved.

75
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,275
You don't understand. It is the feeling
of a club veteran for Mr. Qiang.

76
00:05:41,395 --> 00:05:44,515
Seeing his girlfriend made me happy
from the bottom of my heart.

77
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:47,195
Alright, make the most of the time.
Let's finish shooting before dark.

78
00:05:47,676 --> 00:05:49,356
Half an hour for makeup
and hair styling, okay?

79
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:51,996
- A piece of cake.
- Then let's go upstairs.

80
00:05:52,156 --> 00:05:53,515
- Okay.
- Let's go. This way.

81
00:05:53,515 --> 00:05:54,476
Okay. Let's go.

82
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:57,435
Over there.

83
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:00,635
Come.

84
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:09,315
The lady just now

85
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:12,476
specially cleared this room for you
to do makeup. Go ahead and start.

86
00:06:13,435 --> 00:06:15,515
- Sit.
- Come.

87
00:06:16,556 --> 00:06:19,875
Enjoy the view, scroll
through your phone, fill up your cart

88
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:21,315
and let Mr. Qiang pay for the items.

89
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,796
Then you go ahead. I'll go downstairs.

90
00:06:33,716 --> 00:06:36,395
- Worrying that he'll run away?
- No.

91
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:39,984
I remember you were in college
when he pursued you, right?

92
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:41,275
Senior year.

93
00:06:41,596 --> 00:06:44,676
- And now, where are you working?
- I officially graduated today.

94
00:06:44,796 --> 00:06:46,596
I just attended
the grad school ceremony.

95
00:06:46,996 --> 00:06:49,488
You flew here right
after the ceremony this morning?

96
00:06:50,384 --> 00:06:52,395
Graduation photos in the morning
and wedding photos in the afternoon.

97
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:54,556
That's awesome.

98
00:06:55,676 --> 00:06:58,635
I didn't expect this.
It is a surprise for me.

are you forced to marry him?

Be happier. You are taking
outdoor wedding photos.

139
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,956
- With green mountains as the backdrop.
- I'm not unhappy.

140
00:10:50,956 --> 00:10:52,515
I just lack experience.

141
00:10:55,436 --> 00:10:58,076
What are you doing?
You scared me to death.

142
00:10:58,236 --> 00:10:59,996
If you don't laugh, I'll pick you up.

143

144
00:11:04,356 --> 00:11:07,755
No. The boat will really capsize
if you do this.

145
00:11:08,996 --> 00:11:10,035
Okay, this is nice.

146
00:11:12,436 --> 00:11:14,275
Keep going.

147
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:19,436
Very good. So beautiful.

148
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:29,316
- Keep it up.
- Does anyone want to see a kiss? Kiss.

149
00:11:30,915 --> 00:11:33,795
- In broad daylight?
- And it's outdoors.

150
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:38,555
No, no way.

151
00:11:38,675 --> 00:11:41,076
- You'd fall into the water.
- The water isn't deep anyway.

152
00:11:41,716 --> 00:11:44,106
Right, we can shoot
some behind-the-scenes.

153
00:11:44,106 --> 00:11:46,448
Lots of good photos
were shot in the water.

154
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:48,675
Mr. Qiang, you're in a suit.

155
00:11:48,836 --> 00:11:51,076
Get in the water,
and your erotic appeal will come out.

156
00:11:51,635 --> 00:11:55,155
Agree, Mr. Qiang. Sheng wants to see it.

157
00:11:55,155 --> 00:11:58,316
It's summer and we've been shooting
for so long. Aren't you hot?

158
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:02,236
Getting into the water to cool off.
Come on. How nice it will be!

159
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:05,275
This is Yangshuo in Guilin.
A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

160
00:12:05,596 --> 00:12:08,116
- It's a lot more fun than the seaside.
- Exactly.

161
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:17,716
Look at them.

162
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:19,875
Be reserved.

163
00:12:22,196 --> 00:12:23,596
I can't suppress it anymore.

164
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:25,716
- Just a moment. Do it fast.
- Okay.

165
00:12:26,275 --> 00:12:27,236
Into the water.

166
00:12:33,076 --> 00:12:36,356
- No, I won't go down.
- How are we gonna shoot if you don't?

167
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,116
I really won't go down.

168
00:12:39,196 --> 00:12:40,116
I'll carry you onshore.

169
00:12:44,635 --> 00:12:45,956
I really...

170
00:12:47,196 --> 00:12:50,035
- No. Put me down!
- Don't move. I'll take you onshore.

171
00:12:50,476 --> 00:12:51,996
- No, put me down!
- Don't move.

172
00:12:52,076 --> 00:12:54,035
- Put me down!
- You're gonna fall in the water.

173
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:57,996
- But my veil will get wet.
- It belongs to you already.

174
00:13:23,356 --> 00:13:25,035
- Look at me.
- We'll take a lot of photos.

175
00:13:25,035 --> 00:13:26,596
- Yes, it's really good.
- So happy.

176
00:13:26,596 --> 00:13:30,436
- Go forward. It's really good.
- So envious.

177
00:13:32,755 --> 00:13:33,436
Satisfied now?

178
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,356
Yes, very much so.

179
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:51,875
How come we encounter such a good thing?

180
00:13:53,196 --> 00:13:54,476
This is a hidden Easter egg.

181
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:56,795
Really happy.

182
00:13:58,915 --> 00:14:01,935
- Why are you so happy?
- Qiang Qingci is a man.

183
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,155
His love story has come to fruition.

184
00:14:04,155 --> 00:14:08,076
Come look this way.
Mr. Qiang, smile. Right.

185
00:14:08,836 --> 00:14:12,436
Super handsome.
Golden Piglet, hug him. Right.

186
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:14,515
So beautiful.

187
00:14:14,515 --> 00:14:17,555
If we go now, can we still catch up
with Sheng shooting on the shore?

188
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:19,956
Get closer. Good.

189
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:26,356
Sheng is shy.
If we go now, she'll act unnatural.

190
00:14:37,996 --> 00:14:38,795
Really happy.

191
00:14:45,755 --> 00:14:46,836
So you can smile.

192
00:15:04,996 --> 00:15:07,076
What a pity for your suit.

193
00:15:08,356 --> 00:15:10,755
Not getting in the water yourself
but urging me.

194
00:15:11,555 --> 00:15:13,675
Not having even a bit of guilt
and still laughing.

195
00:15:14,716 --> 00:15:16,275
But the photos are very good.

196
00:15:17,555 --> 00:15:21,356
- As long as you think they're good.
- Aren't they? They're really beautiful.

197
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:25,836
I got so mad at the time.

198
00:15:25,836 --> 00:15:28,795
As soon as I saw her, a pretty girl,
I knelt down right away.

199
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:31,836
- Was it successful?
- So chill.

200
00:15:31,836 --> 00:15:33,675
- Really?
- It was many years ago.

201
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:40,836
Where did you two go just now?
How did you get here earlier than us?

202
00:15:42,596 --> 00:15:46,116
- We've just arrived too.
- Let's go. Don't disturb them.

203
00:15:46,836 --> 00:15:49,635
- Let's go.
- You guys keep staring.

204
00:15:49,635 --> 00:15:51,305
What about the wedding dress?

205
00:15:51,305 --> 00:15:54,116
I agreed with the owner
to pack it up later tonight.

206
00:15:57,476 --> 00:15:58,196
Let's go downstairs.

207
00:15:59,476 --> 00:16:01,755
Come on in. Sit anywhere at this table.

208
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:05,596
We've prepared oil tea for everyone.
You can drink it.

209
00:16:06,316 --> 00:16:09,395
- Mr. Zhu has got into someone again.
- Looking forward to coming here.

210
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:13,515
My apologies first.
Tonight, there will be only fish dishes.

211
00:16:14,555 --> 00:16:16,956
- Please forgive us.
- Is there nothing else except fish?

212
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:18,555
There's also oil tea.

213
00:16:23,555 --> 00:16:26,236
What a big restaurant
and you only have one dish?

214
00:16:27,035 --> 00:16:28,395
And it isn't closed yet?

215
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:30,956
That's really something.

216
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:36,275
- Deliberate cliffhanger.
- Sorry.

217
00:16:36,436 --> 00:16:38,236
- He's like this.
- Shut up, okay?

218
00:16:38,436 --> 00:16:41,236
- The fish dishes here are different.
- What's the difference?

219
00:16:41,236 --> 00:16:45,555
- What is it?
- Actually, we have other dishes here,

220
00:16:46,116 --> 00:16:50,155
but today, I specially invited a chef.

221
00:16:50,316 --> 00:16:54,476
I asked him to cook ten dishes
with the fish from the Lijiang River.

222
00:16:57,956 --> 00:16:58,755
So that's how it is.

223
00:16:59,755 --> 00:17:01,996
- So it's Chef Mo.
- It's you.

224
00:17:02,996 --> 00:17:06,315
The kitchen is ready, and the fish
were all freshly caught today.

225
00:17:06,436 --> 00:17:08,355
- Okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

226
00:17:10,075 --> 00:17:12,876
Mo's fish dishes are second
to none in the world.

227
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:15,835
- They're good.
- Thank you, Mr. Qiang.

228
00:17:16,315 --> 00:17:19,716
He told me that his cooking skills
were quite good. It's true?

229
00:17:19,716 --> 00:17:20,315
- Yes.
- True.

230
00:17:20,476 --> 00:17:25,035
- That's more than just good.
- How did you convince him to cook?

231
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:27,145
It's usually quite difficult to

232
00:17:27,145 --> 00:17:28,555
- get him into the kitchen.
- Indeed.

233
00:17:28,676 --> 00:17:33,196
I didn't trick him.
He insisted on cooking himself.

234
00:17:33,755 --> 00:17:37,956
He told me the people
who'd come today are his best friends.

235
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:41,236
He said that you were busy
with work and didn't meet often.

236
00:17:41,716 --> 00:17:45,835
So, he wanted to prepare a meal
with the local fish for everyone today.

237
00:17:47,595 --> 00:17:48,355
This man is truly...

238
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,555
- Alright.
- I'll leave you guys to chat.

239
00:17:53,676 --> 00:17:55,436
Let me know if you want
more oil tea. I gotta go.

240
00:17:55,476 --> 00:17:57,355
- Okay, thank you, madam.
- You're welcome.

241
00:17:59,115 --> 00:18:02,636
- How can you, Sheng?
- You're so tight-lipped.

242
00:18:02,636 --> 00:18:04,996
- That's right.
- You didn't even tell me.

243
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:07,636
I'll go in to see if my help is needed.
Make yourselves at home.

244
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,315
- She's feeling shy.
- She gets shy easily.

245
00:18:11,876 --> 00:18:14,355
Stop the noise. Does any of you feel

246
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:17,555
something seems off
with those two today?

247
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:21,355
Right. And we're sitting
at such a big table.

248
00:18:21,795 --> 00:18:25,595
- Doesn't it kind of resemble...?
- Resemble what?

249
00:18:25,996 --> 00:18:29,755
- You know that.
- A wedding party.

250
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,916
- Exactly.
- Put on the suit for me.

251
00:18:32,436 --> 00:18:33,595
- Red envelopes!
- I didn't bring a red envelope.

252
00:18:33,595 --> 00:18:36,396
- I didn't bring cash.
- Transferring is fine.

253
00:18:56,716 --> 00:18:58,075
- It smells so good.
- Be careful.

254
00:19:00,876 --> 00:19:01,355
Come on.

255
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,636
Hello, I'm Xiaoxing, Geng Xiaoxing.

256
00:19:06,636 --> 00:19:07,795
- Hello.
- Hello.

257
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:27,196
- Another dish.
- This one is nice, too.

258
00:19:27,515 --> 00:19:29,676
- Another one.
- This is poached fish in chili oil.

259
00:19:29,676 --> 00:19:31,275
- Eat it.
- Really nice. Have a taste.

260
00:19:31,396 --> 00:19:33,436
- Here's another dish.
- This is so delicious.

261
00:19:33,436 --> 00:19:34,956
The Peacock Train Fish.

262
00:19:37,396 --> 00:19:38,436
Beautiful plating.

263
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:58,795
- Cheers.
- It's a joyful reunion.

264
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:19,636
Here it comes, the beer fish.

265
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:25,396
Qiang Qingci,
you made our signature dish.

266
00:20:25,476 --> 00:20:27,196
How dare you make it
in front of us locals?

267
00:20:27,676 --> 00:20:29,236
Madam, come have a taste
and see how he did.

268
00:20:29,236 --> 00:20:30,476
Come to taste it.

269
00:20:30,476 --> 00:20:32,196
- I'm coming.
- This place setting is untouched.

270
00:20:33,196 --> 00:20:35,355
- Have a taste.
- Taste it.

271
00:20:40,075 --> 00:20:41,396
- Authentic.
- Not bad.

272
00:20:41,555 --> 00:20:44,636
- Qiang Qingci, did you hear that?
- Try this.

273
00:20:45,075 --> 00:20:46,876
- Taste it.
- Put it aside.

274
00:20:46,876 --> 00:20:48,115
What's coming now?

275
00:20:50,236 --> 00:20:51,835
The last dish.

276
00:20:53,236 --> 00:20:55,676
- Come on.
- This is our restaurant's signature dish.

277
00:20:55,676 --> 00:20:56,716
You can even make this.

278
00:20:57,196 --> 00:20:58,996
What if the chef in our restaurant
sees this tomorrow

279
00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:01,035
and decides to resign?
Will you work for me instead?

280
00:21:02,075 --> 00:21:03,156
- Be careful.
- The pot.

281
00:21:05,315 --> 00:21:07,476
Sheng ordered this dish for everyone

282
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,515
when getting out of the car.

283
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:14,355
The spotted fish hotpot. We had it
at this restaurant on our first visit.

284
00:21:14,476 --> 00:21:20,035
Right. Since we are
on this subject, let's start eating.

285
00:21:20,035 --> 00:21:22,676
Mr. Mo has been cooking
and hasn't eaten a little yet.

286
00:21:22,755 --> 00:21:26,196
- Let's toast him.
- Come on.

287
00:21:26,196 --> 00:21:28,075
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Cheers.

288
00:21:28,075 --> 00:21:30,585
First of all,
we should thank Mr. Mo for paying

289
00:21:30,585 --> 00:21:32,355
to take us on this nostalgic trip.

290
00:21:32,515 --> 00:21:35,636
Next, we need to say
some auspicious words.

291
00:21:36,835 --> 00:21:38,476
What should we say? Let's each say some.

292
00:21:38,835 --> 00:21:41,716
I'll go first. I'm not very eloquent,
so I'll say the easy ones.

293
00:21:43,396 --> 00:21:45,755
- May all go well.
- Don't embarrass us.

294
00:21:45,755 --> 00:21:49,035
- What's wrong?
- It should be for a couple.

295
00:21:49,636 --> 00:21:51,156
- May your love be solid.
- Right.

296
00:21:51,956 --> 00:21:53,156
- Isn't it good?
- This is good.

297
00:21:53,156 --> 00:21:56,035
- Good.
- Your words sound like...

298
00:21:56,515 --> 00:22:00,275
Actually, I think it really sounds like
we're at a wedding feast.

299
00:22:01,636 --> 00:22:04,275
Be casual. Sheng is shy.

300
00:22:04,396 --> 00:22:07,916
I'd like to say thank you.
Sheng and I graduated together today.

301
00:22:08,075 --> 00:22:10,595
Celebrating our graduation here
is just perfect.

302
00:22:12,476 --> 00:22:15,876
- You're welcome.
- Great! Thanks, Mr. Qiang.

303
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:19,476
Perfect Voice for a perfect evening.

304
00:22:19,476 --> 00:22:22,355
- Is this your late-night radio show?
- Come on.

305
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:26,035
Let's save whatever we have to say
for their real wedding, okay?

306
00:22:26,196 --> 00:22:28,236
I'll speak for everyone.
Then we'll start eating.

307
00:22:29,196 --> 00:22:34,075
- May we all never part ways.
- Well said.

308
00:22:34,075 --> 00:22:36,916
- Long live our friendship!
- Long live our friendship!

309
00:22:41,835 --> 00:22:43,595
Everyone, here are some condiments.

310
00:22:43,716 --> 00:22:45,676
Season to your own taste.
I'll leave you to it.

311
00:22:45,795 --> 00:22:48,355
- Okay.
- That kumquat is especially delicious.

312
00:22:48,355 --> 00:22:50,315
- I'll season it for you.
- Super delicious.

313
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,716
- Help me season one.
- Help me with this, please.

314
00:22:53,716 --> 00:22:56,636
- Come with me.
- It's really tasty. You should try it.

315
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,156
- Soy sauce.
- Soy sauce.

316
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,716
You prepared
an extra portion separately?

317
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:07,436
Let's eat alone.

318
00:23:12,075 --> 00:23:15,355
Is it nice if we eat here by ourselves?

319
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:24,835
It is special today.

320
00:23:31,315 --> 00:23:32,956
- Is it tasty?
- Yes.

321
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:42,716
- Come on.
- Eat the soup.

322
00:23:42,835 --> 00:23:46,075
- It's tasty.
- I'm tired of saying "tasty" tonight.

323
00:23:48,676 --> 00:23:51,636
Come on. Anyway,
it's Qiang Qingci's treat.

324
00:23:51,795 --> 00:23:55,156
- Don't stand on ceremony. Fill up.
- Others may think you're paying.

325
00:23:55,156 --> 00:23:56,876
- Don't just drink. Eat it.
- It's hot.

326
00:23:57,555 --> 00:23:59,396
- This is the essence.
- Fine.

327
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:03,876
Try this.

328
00:24:09,035 --> 00:24:10,156
Enough. So annoying.

329
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:15,035
I have a question, Juemei.
I have been wondering

330
00:24:15,676 --> 00:24:17,835
when exactly you two started dating.

331
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,676
Yeah, we tried to deduce the time
but just couldn't figure it out.

332
00:24:22,555 --> 00:24:25,315
At least tell us how you
formally confessed your feelings.

333
00:24:25,396 --> 00:24:26,476
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

334
00:24:32,115 --> 00:24:36,716
- Eat it.
- What? There wasn't a formal confession?

335
00:24:37,515 --> 00:24:39,835
- You were wrong, Zhou.
- Yes.

336
00:24:40,515 --> 00:24:42,685
Can you stop worrying about this?

337
00:24:42,685 --> 00:24:45,755
When it's meant to be,
you just end up together.

338
00:24:48,515 --> 00:24:52,595
Xiaoxing, sorry. He let you down
as a man from our dubbing team.

339
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:55,996
But this is definitely not on us.

340
00:24:56,436 --> 00:24:59,755
- It's his problem alone.
- If it were me, I'd confess in person.

341
00:24:59,755 --> 00:25:02,795
- Do you even have a crush?
- Zhou's tall and big,

342
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:05,876
- but he's shy and stubborn.
- Exactly.

343
00:25:05,996 --> 00:25:06,716
Watch your words.

344
00:25:08,636 --> 00:25:09,476
Right?

345
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:13,595
I just love that he's shy and stubborn.

346
00:25:16,636 --> 00:25:19,075
- My goosebumps.
- Here's to being stubborn. I'll drink.

347
00:25:20,795 --> 00:25:21,795
Here's to a sharp tongue.

348
00:25:28,075 --> 00:25:30,315
- Where are you going, Doudou?
- I'm going out for some fresh air.

349
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:34,916
- Eat it.
- Eat this soup.

350
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,315
- It is nutritious.
- I'll try it.

351
00:25:46,928 --> 00:25:47,760
I just had a breakup.

352
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,956
I can't bear to
listen to them talk about this.

353
00:25:51,396 --> 00:25:55,355
So are you by yourself or...?

354
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:57,636
I have so many chefs and waiters here.

355
00:25:58,595 --> 00:26:01,676
You know how to chat. Cheers.

356
00:26:35,075 --> 00:26:36,275
When I first met you,

357
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:39,595
I was a high school student,

358
00:26:41,795 --> 00:26:42,716
and you were in college.

359
00:26:44,676 --> 00:26:45,716
No matter how I thought,

360
00:26:48,236 --> 00:26:49,315
you wouldn't like me.

361
00:26:53,436 --> 00:26:54,476
Later,

362
00:26:56,676 --> 00:26:58,275
every time I stood in front of you,

363
00:27:02,236 --> 00:27:03,676
I could only act
like a high school student.

364
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,115
I...

365
00:27:21,115 --> 00:27:21,996
Well...

366
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:27,236
I don't know what to say.

367
00:27:28,835 --> 00:27:29,835
Or can you

368
00:27:32,515 --> 00:27:33,396
feel it?

369
00:28:17,795 --> 00:28:20,515
Well, I...

370
00:28:25,156 --> 00:28:26,636
Don't speak.

371
00:29:07,436 --> 00:29:09,075
- The bar is still there.
- What?

372
00:29:11,156 --> 00:29:13,315
- Where do you guys want to go?
- Let's go that way.

373
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:14,436
- That way.
- Right.

374
00:29:14,436 --> 00:29:16,515
(Durian House)

375
00:29:16,515 --> 00:29:17,876
Do you remember the baked durian?

376
00:29:18,835 --> 00:29:20,515
Yes. You want to eat it again?

377
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:23,876
Let's go.

378
00:29:25,755 --> 00:29:30,236
Baked durian.
Freshly baked durian in Yangshuo.

379
00:29:30,315 --> 00:29:32,555
- What would you like?
- Two servings of baked durian.

380
00:29:32,555 --> 00:29:35,355
Alright, would you also like
some durian ice cream? It's popular.

381
00:29:36,716 --> 00:29:37,956
- Okay, I'll have one.
- Alright.

382
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:39,636
- How much is it in total?
- 35.

383
00:29:48,595 --> 00:29:52,275
The photo was taken two years ago
during the 10th anniversary

384
00:29:52,396 --> 00:29:55,275
of a large dubbing club.
Our boss is a fan.

385
00:29:55,676 --> 00:29:57,916
There are many autographs on it.

386
00:30:08,852 --> 00:30:10,000
(Ten years of dreams and love)

387
00:30:25,275 --> 00:30:25,835
Here you go.

388
00:30:27,275 --> 00:30:28,716
- Your order.
- Thank you.

389
00:30:29,636 --> 00:30:32,996
Tell your boss we love
her baked durian so much.

390
00:30:33,156 --> 00:30:34,835
It's been two years
and we still can't forget it.

391
00:30:35,436 --> 00:30:36,956
You watched the 10th anniversary, too?

392
00:30:39,555 --> 00:30:41,396
We really like the Perfect Voice Studio.

393
00:30:43,035 --> 00:30:45,996
- Alright then, take care.
- Okay. Let's go.

394
00:30:48,884 --> 00:30:52,528
(Qiang Qingci)

395
00:30:54,115 --> 00:30:55,555
- You're back.
- Yes.

396
00:30:56,716 --> 00:31:00,115
Right, just now two people mentioned
they enjoyed our baked durian a lot.

397
00:31:00,436 --> 00:31:03,436
They like that dubbing team
just like you do.

398
00:31:03,755 --> 00:31:05,355
Really? Did you give them a discount?

399
00:31:05,436 --> 00:31:07,716
- I didn't.
- Remember to give a discount next time.

400
00:31:12,756 --> 00:31:14,224
(Qiang Qingci)

401
00:31:15,196 --> 00:31:16,075
Who wrote this?

402
00:31:19,156 --> 00:31:19,996
I don't know.

403
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:21,648
(Qiang Qingci)

404
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:28,315
- Was it those two people from earlier?
- I have no idea.

405
00:31:31,275 --> 00:31:32,236
What's the matter?

406
00:31:34,236 --> 00:31:36,035
Say it again.
What did those two look like?

407
00:31:36,035 --> 00:31:40,436
I-I-It was a man and a woman.
T-T-They seemed to be a couple.

408
00:31:40,555 --> 00:31:41,436
What did they look like?

409
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:46,355
The g-g-guy was quite handsome,
and the w-w-woman was pretty.

410
00:32:02,156 --> 00:32:05,115
This one. Their liquor
is exceptionally tasty.

411
00:32:06,835 --> 00:32:10,315
It's just that after a few drinks,
it tends to make someone talkative.

412
00:32:12,636 --> 00:32:15,436
I didn't say anything
I shouldn't have that day, did I?

413
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:19,236
Hurry and tell me.

414
00:32:25,515 --> 00:32:29,236
Did you intend to kiss me on the day

415
00:32:31,476 --> 00:32:32,515
of the performance?

416
00:32:34,355 --> 00:32:34,755
Forget it.

417
00:32:36,315 --> 00:32:39,156
Mo Qingcheng,
if you don't tell me, I'll be mad.

418
00:32:41,476 --> 00:32:44,436
Knowing you for such a long time,
I've never seen you angry.

419
00:32:44,835 --> 00:32:46,355
Come on, give me a demonstration.

420
00:32:48,396 --> 00:32:49,315
Come on, show me.

421
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:52,035
Tell me or I'm not leaving.

422
00:32:54,716 --> 00:32:56,595
If you don't leave,
others will be watching us.

423
00:32:58,075 --> 00:33:00,275
You must tell me what I said.

424
00:33:00,275 --> 00:33:02,436
I know I talk a lot when I'm drunk.

425
00:33:03,436 --> 00:33:05,436
You must tell me what I said.

426
00:33:05,876 --> 00:33:09,236
The past is the past. I don't mind.

427
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:12,595
- Let's go.
- I'm really not going to leave.

428
00:33:14,676 --> 00:33:15,156
Okay.

429
00:33:17,876 --> 00:33:18,956
Mo Qingcheng.

430
00:33:21,315 --> 00:33:22,236
Mo Qingcheng.

431
00:33:23,956 --> 00:33:25,236
Mo Qingcheng.

432
00:33:26,996 --> 00:33:30,676
Mo Qingcheng, just tell me.
What did I say that day?

433
00:33:31,396 --> 00:33:33,236
- Please.
- Okay, I'll tell you.

434
00:33:35,396 --> 00:33:38,476
On that day, you asked me
why I didn't kiss you.

435
00:33:39,115 --> 00:33:43,795
How was that possible?
How could I ask that question?

436
00:33:49,075 --> 00:33:51,755
I can't believe it. How was it possible,
Mo Qingcheng? Don't you always...?

00:38:10,301 --> 00:38:11,921

without knowing the end.)

512
00:38:11,921 --> 00:38:15,161
(Just for this one life and this passion
which never extinguishes.)

513
00:38:29,595 --> 00:38:31,515
Isn't this the place
for our 10th anniversary?

514
00:38:32,996 --> 00:38:34,756
You go in first.
Cars aren't allowed to park here.

515
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:36,155
I'll come to you after I park it.

517
00:38:39,756 --> 00:38:40,675
I've made arrangements.

00:39:29,356 --> 00:39:31,996

for the theme song.)

519

(They want you to help them
with the harmony. Anyway,)

520
00:39:36,316 --> 00:39:40,476
I think you'll be fine
because you're the best.

521
00:39:42,115 --> 00:39:43,115
I am the best.

523

00:41:41,756 --> 00:41:45,115
- I'm ready, Mr. Qiang.
- You can call me Qiang Qingci

535
00:41:45,515 --> 00:41:47,635
or Mo Qingcheng.
No need to call me Mr. Qiang.

536
00:41:48,396 --> 00:41:53,035

to go? I'll pick you up this Sunday.)

Are you shocked?

543
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:14,675
(Be my guest. It's my place.
I can afford it.)

544
00:42:15,155 --> 00:42:16,956
(I just want to see you after a day.)

545
00:42:17,155 --> 00:42:20,876

in my voice chat room that day?)

some spare time and was browsing online)

548
00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:35,396

to enter your voice chat room?)

the ID of Shengshengman anymore,)

or sorrowful, I will be with you.)
