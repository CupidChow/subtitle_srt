(Sudden Wedding Fever)

26
00:01:53,283 --> 00:01:58,543
I was just thinking
our audience feedback was so positive,

27
00:01:58,543 --> 00:02:03,564
and I could ask you for something wild,
but you ended up just hugging her.

28
00:02:03,564 --> 00:02:07,284
You wasted a 24-hour live broadcast.

29
00:02:07,284 --> 00:02:12,044
I'm a cosplayer, but my voice is hoarser
than those of you voice actors.

30
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:15,624
Don't you know him? Mr. Qiang has
a sharp tongue but he's thin-skinned.

31
00:02:15,624 --> 00:02:20,484
Be patient. Mr. Qiang will do
something wilder once he gets off.

32
00:02:20,484 --> 00:02:22,003
- Really?
- Is it true?

33
00:02:22,003 --> 00:02:22,896
Right.

34
00:02:24,163 --> 00:02:27,644
- Is it true, Sheng?
- Sheng has thin skin. Please help her.

35
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:33,944
Stop. Sheng is a girl. You guys
can't talk about her like that.

36
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:38,404
Watch your words. You guys
have so many fans. Be serious.

37
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:40,644
- Don't you know any better?
- Right.

38
00:02:40,644 --> 00:02:43,084
Sheng is from our singer department.
How could you behave like this?

39
00:02:43,084 --> 00:02:45,484
- Right, it's you.
- We're really disappointed in you.

40
00:02:45,484 --> 00:02:48,644
You were really bold tonight,
even saying Sheng was your girl.

41
00:02:50,443 --> 00:02:52,244
Your throat is better?

42
00:02:53,443 --> 00:02:56,563
- No, I'm gonna drink some water.
- Drink a lot.

43
00:02:59,723 --> 00:03:01,456
- Don't worry.
- Thanks.

44
00:03:02,512 --> 00:03:03,568
N-Not at all.

45
00:03:05,964 --> 00:03:12,824
- Did you ever see a dubbed play before?
- No, it was my first time.

46
00:03:12,824 --> 00:03:19,443
- What do you think?
- Quite stunning. I'm still excited.

47
00:03:21,443 --> 00:03:25,084
Really? I didn't manage
to play to my full strength.

48
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:31,304
They just love to joke around.
The best solution is to ignore them.

49
00:03:31,304 --> 00:03:33,883
Otherwise, once I respond,
they'll never stop.

50
00:03:37,123 --> 00:03:37,603
Are you tired?

51
00:03:38,764 --> 00:03:41,484
Singing was not tiring,
but being nervous exhausted me.

52
00:03:50,324 --> 00:03:53,924
- Really angry? Why?
- Being petty, aren't you?

53
00:04:14,084 --> 00:04:18,744
The estimated number was 3,000,000.
Tonight, it was over 20,000,000!

54
00:04:18,744 --> 00:04:23,124
- The Perfect Voice is too awesome.
- Not sleeping yet? It's about time.

55
00:04:23,124 --> 00:04:27,964
Don't I have to write a report? Anyway,
I'm still excited and can't sleep.

56
00:04:31,124 --> 00:04:33,324
Once I finish writing,
we can let loose and enjoy ourselves.

57
00:04:40,675 --> 00:04:41,635
It's about time to leave.

58
00:05:08,635 --> 00:05:09,435
What's on your mind?

59
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:12,675
I'm sleepy. I woke up too early.

60
00:05:14,435 --> 00:05:18,115
I'm used to it. I often get up
at 5 AM or 6 AM for the early shift.

61
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:26,495
Mr. Zhu, where are we going today?
Why don't you introduce it?

62
00:05:26,495 --> 00:05:27,274
Okay.

63
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:32,034
Today, everyone will visit
the Longji Rice Terraces, our last stop.

64
00:05:34,154 --> 00:05:37,914
What's wrong with you? You seem to be
in a low mood and a bit sentimental.

65
00:05:39,555 --> 00:05:45,635
- Do you want eye drops for a good cry?
- Stop. I didn't rest well yesterday.

66
00:05:51,474 --> 00:05:55,114
With such a good response, it'll be
easier to get sponsors next time.

67
00:05:55,114 --> 00:05:59,792
You can start planning the next play
once we leave tomorrow.

68
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,955
- Deal?
- Yes. Deal.

69
00:06:02,955 --> 00:06:06,075
He's the hardest to ask. He said yes.
It means our studio said yes.

70
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:07,395
- Right.
- Right.

71
00:06:07,395 --> 00:06:07,954
I'll join too.

72
00:06:09,195 --> 00:06:09,875
Okay.

73
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,855
- A better mood now.
- You're brightened.

74
00:06:12,855 --> 00:06:17,514
Mr. Zhu, you're the best. So,
where are we going finally today?

75
00:06:17,514 --> 00:06:19,575
- Isn't it time for an introduction?
- Do introduce it.

76
00:06:19,575 --> 00:06:23,535
- Stand up, professional guide.
- Come on.

77
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:30,495
Our last stop is Longji Rice Terraces,
a national 4A-level scenic area.

78
00:06:30,495 --> 00:06:34,934
- Wow!
- Stunning views and a pleasant climate.

79
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:38,320
A lush green expanse, so beautiful.
Seriously, you all need to take a look.

80
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,434
I really suggest you buy
a house there if you can.

81
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:45,495
Stop. You are not taking us
to appreciate the Longji Rice Terraces.

82
00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:48,315
- You're urging us to buy land there.
- Exactly.

83
00:06:48,315 --> 00:06:49,755
- We should buy
- We will.

84
00:06:49,755 --> 00:06:51,714
- since it's Mr. Zhu's order.
- Mr. Zhu, why don't you buy

85
00:06:51,714 --> 00:06:55,034
- a house big enough to hold us all?
- Who has so much money?

86
00:06:55,034 --> 00:06:56,514
- So what? You must.
- Is that what you mean?

87
00:06:57,755 --> 00:06:58,795
Just buy one.

So pretty. Let's go rent ones too.

104
00:07:58,035 --> 00:08:00,375
- Sure. Where is it?
- I saw it on the way.

105
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:03,334
There are Miao and Zhuang costumes.
Let's each pick one to take photos.

106

- Alright.
- Wait for a moment.

108
00:08:15,914 --> 00:08:20,034
- Make me look better on the camera.
- How do you feel when it's almost over?

My feelings.

110
00:08:25,514 --> 00:08:31,755
- I have a sudden wedding fever.
- Are you not afraid of scaring her?

111
00:08:38,954 --> 00:08:43,915
- What do you think? Am I pretty?
- Amazing. I almost don't recognize you.

112
00:08:57,075 --> 00:08:58,915
- Take it.
- I will take photos for you.

113

Yes.

115
00:09:08,155 --> 00:09:13,615
- What do the locals wear for weddings?
- I didn't ask. Do you want to rent one?

116
00:09:13,615 --> 00:09:18,435
I'm single. I'm asking for someone.

117
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:26,714
- Let's go there to take some photos.
- Okay.

118
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:31,515
- They're leaving.
- They're shy.

119
00:09:31,515 --> 00:09:34,554
- Forget them. Let's continue. Come on.
- Come on.

120
00:09:34,554 --> 00:09:36,464
- Come join us.
- Together.

121
00:09:36,464 --> 00:09:38,315
- You hold this.
- Okay. The four of us together.

122
00:09:38,315 --> 00:09:39,234
- Come on.
- Come on.

123
00:09:40,994 --> 00:09:42,954
- Give me your phone.
- Okay.

124
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:51,675
Are you ready? One, two, three.

125
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:55,954
One, two, three.

126
00:09:58,354 --> 00:09:59,714
One, two, three.

127
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:11,315
- What are you looking at?
- Watch your step. Many steps.

128
00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:17,435
Slow down. Walk behind me.

129
00:10:19,155 --> 00:10:22,854
- Why should I walk behind?
- The steps are too narrow.

130
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:26,795
If you slip, I'm ahead
to stop you from rolling down.

131
00:10:34,714 --> 00:10:37,435
I can't see the end at all.
How much longer do we have to walk?

132
00:10:39,035 --> 00:10:39,714
Take it slow.

133
00:10:40,954 --> 00:10:42,395
There's no rush anyway.

134
00:10:43,754 --> 00:10:46,234
Normally, work is crazy busy.

135
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:50,195
It's rare to not be in a hurry
and to walk slowly like this.

136
00:10:56,594 --> 00:10:58,634
Slow down. The ground is slippery.

137
00:10:59,754 --> 00:11:02,615
If I were your girlfriend,
I'd be annoyed by your dawdling.

138
00:11:02,615 --> 00:11:07,235
If you fall, your shoes will get wet,
and your trousers will be damaged.

139
00:11:07,235 --> 00:11:12,814
- You'll have to pay for the clothes.
- Yes, you're absolutely right.

140
00:11:12,814 --> 00:11:20,775
- Can we still get down before dusk?
- I'm doing this for your own good.

141
00:11:20,775 --> 00:11:26,895
- You're older but more reckless.
- Do you have to emphasize my age?

142
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:32,794
Yes. When you want to curse me,
remember to be kind to the young.

143
00:11:32,794 --> 00:11:36,555
When did I curse you?
Tell me when I cursed you.

144
00:11:37,954 --> 00:11:39,994
- Let's go. You're blocking the way.
- I...

145
00:11:42,195 --> 00:11:45,435
- Slow down. You stepped on my skirt.
- You told me not to dawdle. Let's go.

146
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:49,035
Slow down.

147
00:11:52,315 --> 00:11:55,994
- So beautiful.
- I'll hold you ahead. Walk slowly.

148
00:11:55,994 --> 00:12:01,794
- Why are you two changing places? Fun?
- He's caring for his girlfriend.

149
00:12:01,794 --> 00:12:05,835
You could never be
as considerate as Mr. Qiang.

150
00:12:05,835 --> 00:12:08,315
I say one thing and here comes lectures.

151
00:12:08,315 --> 00:12:11,674
Because I'm angry. Without you,
I would have arrived before them.

152
00:12:11,674 --> 00:12:16,975
All my effort protecting you
was in vain. My hand is all stiff now.

153
00:12:16,975 --> 00:12:21,255
What do you want? Let me massage it.
Mr. Feng, you've worked hard.

154
00:12:21,255 --> 00:12:24,114
Be cautious. Don't fall.

155
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:33,275
Underneath is firewood.

156
00:12:34,594 --> 00:12:39,354
Have you noticed underneath the houses
we've come across are all woodsheds?

157
00:12:40,675 --> 00:12:43,555
The overall area is damp.
The first floor is not habitable.

158
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:48,435
What took you so long?
Do you want something to drink?

159
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:53,215
- Do you want?
- No, thank you. I won't drink.

160
00:12:53,215 --> 00:12:54,994
- Let's take a break.
- Okay.

161
00:13:02,594 --> 00:13:04,754
It's time to go back.
I'm reluctant to leave.

162
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:08,816
What can't you part with?

163
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:14,384
The beer fish,
the spotted fish or the oil tea?

164
00:13:15,536 --> 00:13:16,474
All of them.

165
00:13:17,754 --> 00:13:19,754
And the hundred thousand green hills.

166
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:23,594
How do they reckon there are
a hundred thousand green hills?

167
00:13:26,234 --> 00:13:27,234
They stretch unbroken.

168
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:29,555
It's over a hundred thousand.

169
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:36,208
- You've searched it?
- Days ago, I recorded an audiobook.

170
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:41,735
It tells of a revolutionary general
from Guilin during the warlord era.

171
00:13:41,735 --> 00:13:46,714
He fought a lot, battling warlords
and resisting the Japan's Army.

172
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:50,354
But in the end, he didn't return here.

173
00:13:53,035 --> 00:13:54,555
This is his mother's hometown.

174
00:13:55,954 --> 00:14:01,195
The place where he grew up.
He mentioned the green hills

175
00:14:02,435 --> 00:14:03,536
and Lijiang River many times.

176
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:06,634
People of that era

177
00:14:07,874 --> 00:14:08,754
are admirable.

178
00:14:10,594 --> 00:14:13,354
You make me want
to write a song so badly.

179
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:20,594
I'm getting busier and busier
and hardly have time for recording.

180
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:25,834
However, I still keep recording
audiobooks as it forces me to read.

181
00:14:26,994 --> 00:14:32,275
Moreover, I've enjoyed listening to
audiobooks alone since childhood.

182
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:37,834
Then, when I started recording,
I felt that listening to audiobooks

183
00:14:40,075 --> 00:14:42,114
was like accompanying real persons.

184
00:14:49,195 --> 00:14:51,954
I suddenly found
this type of clothing is quite nice.

185
00:14:53,795 --> 00:14:58,735
At home, as long as you hear
the sound from the clothes,

186
00:14:58,735 --> 00:15:02,515
you know someone's back
and it's time to cook.

187
00:15:04,714 --> 00:15:08,474
What if a group of girls
pass by the house?

188
00:15:10,315 --> 00:15:11,714
Then,

189
00:15:14,354 --> 00:15:16,915
I'll add a few more bells
to your necklace.

190
00:15:19,114 --> 00:15:20,155
Different from others.

191
00:15:22,954 --> 00:15:26,755
Qiang Qingci will use up
all his sweet talk on Shengshengman.

192
00:15:26,755 --> 00:15:30,554
- Isn't that how it should be?
- Aren't you over the constant dissing?

193
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:34,174
You guys always gang up on Qiang Qingci.

194
00:15:34,174 --> 00:15:37,235
- I didn't go that far.
- I...

195
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:41,754
Mu is an expert at dissing people,
so I never provoke him.

196
00:15:46,874 --> 00:15:50,755
We only have time to visit this place.
Next time, you can...

197
00:15:50,755 --> 00:15:53,075
- They're back.
- They're back.

198
00:15:53,075 --> 00:15:54,896
- They're back.
- Looking strange after the change.

199
00:15:58,234 --> 00:15:59,435
- It's the last day.
- Hungry?

200
00:15:59,435 --> 00:16:01,954
- It's hard for me to part.
- A little bit.

201
00:16:03,435 --> 00:16:06,575
Speaking of which,
it's hardest for me to part.

202
00:16:06,575 --> 00:16:11,414
It's rare to have such an event
where all you big shots get together.

203
00:16:11,414 --> 00:16:15,216
Our flight is early tomorrow morning.
It's 1 PM now.

204
00:16:16,336 --> 00:16:20,715
Though it's a nice day with great views,
no need to say goodbye so early, right?

205
00:16:20,715 --> 00:16:27,615
- More emotional than voice actors.
- We need to be understanding.

206
00:16:27,615 --> 00:16:30,435
- The cue for music now.
- The emotion time.

207
00:16:30,435 --> 00:16:34,354
- Look.
- You never understand my tenderness.

208
00:16:34,354 --> 00:16:38,195
Alright, I'll hold it in, okay?
Let's go on the bus.

209
00:16:43,954 --> 00:16:46,555
What are you staring at?
Not leaving and being naughty?

210
00:16:46,555 --> 00:16:50,055
All the cars here are chartered. If you
don't leave, there will be no cars left.

211
00:16:50,608 --> 00:16:55,115
You're too emotional.
It's 1 PM, and we haven't even eaten.

212
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:59,635
Another 2-hour ride before we eat
will make us never visit you again.

213
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:03,536
Meal time. I've arranged
the restaurant. You made me forget.

214
00:17:04,115 --> 00:17:05,315
- Let's go.
- Thanks, Mr. Zhu.

215
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,795
- Let's go this way.
- Go.

216
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:09,795
Mr. Zhu, you're very considerate.

217
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:13,520
(Zhuang Country-style Cuisines)
Starving.

218
00:17:14,352 --> 00:17:15,215
So hot.

219
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:19,194
- You took so long to get two bottles?
- I can't stand the thirst anymore.

220
00:17:19,194 --> 00:17:22,194
Not for drinking. It's for washing
tableware. You still don't know it?

221
00:17:22,194 --> 00:17:25,475
- Clueless.
- I was just about to do it.

222
00:17:25,475 --> 00:17:27,355
- Wash it for me.
- Muddleheaded, aren't you?

223
00:17:27,355 --> 00:17:31,095
- What are the specialties here?
- Waitress, the menu.

224
00:17:31,095 --> 00:17:36,215
You've eaten almost everything. The rice
in bamboo tubes here is the best.

225
00:17:36,215 --> 00:17:37,595
So I brought you here today.

226
00:17:37,595 --> 00:17:38,795
(Rice in Bamboo Tubes)
The rice in bamboo tubes.

227
00:17:38,795 --> 00:17:44,075
This is all cooked on the fire.
There's both regular and glutinous rice.

228
00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:50,915
Many flavors, pickled bamboo shoots,
chopped beef, oil tofu, smoked meat.

229
00:17:50,915 --> 00:17:52,955
- There are many.
- One of each flavor.

230
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:57,335
- I think this is tasty.
- I'd like to try a bit of each dish.

231
00:17:57,335 --> 00:17:59,394
Osmanthus wine.

232
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:05,195
- Right. It should be paired with wine.
- To pair with the rice and...

233
00:18:05,195 --> 00:18:08,974
- Stir-fried bamboo shoots with eggs.
- Mr. Qiang, you understand too well.

234
00:18:08,974 --> 00:18:13,594
The bamboo shoots were just dug up
from the mountain after the rain.

235
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:19,755
No other place has such fresh shoots.
Crisp, sweet and refreshing.

236
00:18:21,035 --> 00:18:24,354
If you stir-fry it with some eggs,
it'll be even tenderer than eggs.

237
00:18:26,394 --> 00:18:29,055
Zhu, you might as well become
a food vlogger as a side job.

238
00:18:29,055 --> 00:18:33,975
These two would make the best team.
One cooks and one eats.

239
00:18:33,975 --> 00:18:39,874
I'm busy managing my large business.
Usually, it's my secretary's duty.

240
00:18:39,874 --> 00:18:43,614
If it weren't for our friendship,
you wouldn't even be able to see me.

241
00:18:43,614 --> 00:18:45,995
- Getting cocky.
- Putting on airs.

242
00:18:45,995 --> 00:18:48,834
- Keep your back straight when you talk.
- Yes.

243
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:52,295
He used to insist on tipping me
when listening to my live-stream?

244
00:18:52,295 --> 00:18:55,095
- He's being shy.
- You're exposing someone's past.

245
00:18:55,095 --> 00:18:57,815
- His filter was too strong back then.
- Stop it.

246
00:18:57,815 --> 00:18:59,575
You start to sweat. Look.

247
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:03,995
How about this?
I'll order two of each flavor

248
00:19:03,995 --> 00:19:05,935
- for you all, okay?
- Okay.

249
00:19:05,935 --> 00:19:07,434
- Wait a moment. It's okay.
- Thank you.

250
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:08,315
You drink so fast.

251
00:19:09,795 --> 00:19:13,075
You're always making fun of him.
Is he really the biggest sponsor?

252
00:19:14,515 --> 00:19:15,874
His business is doing quite well.

253
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:21,815
When we first met at a restaurant, he
entered and said he owned a share of it.

254
00:19:21,815 --> 00:19:26,115
We all thought it was a joke, but then
the owner came over to greet us!

255
00:19:26,115 --> 00:19:29,055
And back then he was really shy.
You couldn't tell at all.

256
00:19:29,055 --> 00:19:32,295
- Right. Not like now.
- What about me now?

257
00:19:32,295 --> 00:19:35,475
You gave me a fright.
Speak of the devil.

258
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:39,554
- Only these dishes now?
- How could I not be shy? All big shots.

259
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:42,655
But let me tell you.
This is what's interesting online.

260
00:19:42,655 --> 00:19:46,395
No matter in your everyday life,
how rich you are or what you look like,

261
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:49,835
if you want others to respect you,
you must be capable, right?

262
00:19:49,835 --> 00:19:51,795
- Right.
- Well said.

263
00:19:51,795 --> 00:19:54,075
- I'll go have a look.
- Hurry up.

264
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:56,275
Give it a taste.

265
00:19:58,914 --> 00:20:01,175
- What's there to choose from?
- She says this is delicious.

266
00:20:01,175 --> 00:20:05,235
- Here's the rice in bamboo tubes.
- Considerate.

267
00:20:05,235 --> 00:20:08,435
- Great! Put them here.
- Hot.

268
00:20:08,435 --> 00:20:11,635
- Take away the plates.
- The dishes. Here are all the dishes.

269
00:20:11,635 --> 00:20:13,315
- Spin it to eat what you want.
- Alright.

270
00:20:13,315 --> 00:20:15,914
- We have the same.
- This is minced meat. The same.

271
00:20:17,035 --> 00:20:17,995
I'll try mine.

272
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:26,354
So good. This is glutinous rice.

273
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:29,515
- Try this. It's made with rice.
- Okay.

274
00:20:30,795 --> 00:20:31,515
Rice.

275
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:37,515
It's also good.

276
00:20:38,674 --> 00:20:40,035
- Try this.
- Okay.

277
00:20:44,914 --> 00:20:45,874
Fresh and sweet.

278
00:20:48,434 --> 00:20:51,735
I plan to read some food-related books
and learn more words later.

279
00:20:51,735 --> 00:20:56,154
Otherwise, I can only say
it's delicious and fresh.

280
00:20:57,315 --> 00:20:57,995
That's fine too.

281
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:03,115
What are you laughing at?

282
00:21:03,115 --> 00:21:05,434
Zhu, you used to be quite shy.
Why are you like this now?

283
00:21:05,434 --> 00:21:07,435
- What's wrong with me?
- Perform a shy act for everyone.

284
00:21:07,435 --> 00:21:10,995
- Do it.
- I'm too old for that.

285
00:21:10,995 --> 00:21:13,555
Zhu, I'll toast you.

286
00:21:20,394 --> 00:21:21,834
Thanks for your hard work this time.

287
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:26,834
- An honor to have Mr. Qiang's toast.
- Thank you.

288
00:21:28,475 --> 00:21:29,275
You drank it all?

289
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:32,314
- Quite a drinker.
- Good tolerance.

290
00:21:32,314 --> 00:21:33,194
Another glass.

291
00:21:35,114 --> 00:21:38,255
It was a public performance yesterday.
Today, it's for us.

292
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,475
- Here's to our own tenth anniversary.
- Cheers.

293
00:21:41,475 --> 00:21:44,434
- To our tenth anniversary.
- To our tenth anniversary.

294
00:21:44,434 --> 00:21:46,755
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

295
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:57,434
You overate again.
I told you to eat slower.

296
00:21:58,715 --> 00:22:01,194
For the last night,
I've booked a villa suite for you.

297
00:22:03,674 --> 00:22:11,315
The beautiful scenery, the river
and the green mountains, and the villa.

298
00:22:12,354 --> 00:22:14,675
- It's out of date, Zhu.
- No, it's not.

299
00:22:14,675 --> 00:22:16,795
Let me tell you something, Sheng.

300
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:21,335
Zhu knows we are leaving tomorrow.
He booked a villa suite for us to party.

301
00:22:21,335 --> 00:22:22,555
Reserved for you.

302
00:22:22,555 --> 00:22:26,194
- Thank you, Mr. Zhu.
- Thank you, Mr. Zhu.

303
00:22:26,194 --> 00:22:29,095
Don't mention it.
You gave it up yourself.

304
00:22:29,095 --> 00:22:33,375
- It's our last day, after all.
- Thank you, Mr. Zhu.

305
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:36,595
- Is one enough?
- No.

306
00:22:36,595 --> 00:22:39,394
- One room per person.
- We want two more rooms.

307
00:22:39,394 --> 00:22:43,194
- Quite quiet here.
- Let's turn here.

308
00:22:45,194 --> 00:22:48,275
- Let's go. What do you think?
- Magnificent.

309
00:22:50,834 --> 00:22:51,515
Have a look.

310
00:22:52,874 --> 00:22:55,194
- It's by the river.
- And a yard too.

311
00:22:55,194 --> 00:22:58,355
- This is really good.
- Come and take a look.

312
00:22:58,355 --> 00:23:00,475
- Look over there.
- It lifts our spirits.

313
00:23:00,475 --> 00:23:04,555
- We can have a barbecue at night.
- The water is suitable for swimming.

314
00:23:04,555 --> 00:23:06,955
- The tea set is nice too.
- All of these are particularly good.

315
00:23:08,114 --> 00:23:09,915
- Let's play mahjong.
- Okay, I'll get the mahjong set.

316
00:23:09,915 --> 00:23:12,475
- Anyone up for playing mahjong?
- Me!

317
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,295
- Sheng, I'm heading over there.
- Let's go.

318
00:23:14,295 --> 00:23:17,114
- Where did you find it?
- Mahjong.

319
00:23:20,035 --> 00:23:22,655
- Let's go out for a walk.
- Where are we going?

320
00:23:22,655 --> 00:23:26,555
- The West Street. Go tidy up first.
- Okay.

321
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:30,515
Come on.

322
00:23:32,114 --> 00:23:33,840
Smile. Be happier.

323
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,215
- Handsome.
- Make sure to get the sun in the photo.

324
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,235
- Of course.
- Let me check it out.

325
00:23:41,235 --> 00:23:43,955
The scenery is so beautiful.
I really don't want to leave.

326
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:48,914
- How about we open a restaurant here?
- I refuse. I want to pursue my career.

327
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,035
I'm not giving you the picture.

328
00:23:55,434 --> 00:24:00,195
- Where are you two going? Together.
- Are you trying to be a third wheel?

329
00:24:00,195 --> 00:24:01,872
If it rains, I can hold
an umbrella for them.

330
00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:05,855
- Where are you going?
- The West Street. You can come join us.

331
00:24:05,855 --> 00:24:08,194
- Alright
- Let's go.

332
00:24:11,755 --> 00:24:14,475
- Which place do you want to go to?
- Hurry up.

333
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:17,545
Look at this.

334
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,695
Catch it.

335
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:24,754
- A piglet.
- So cute.

336
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,515
- Don't run.
- Help them!

337
00:24:27,795 --> 00:24:29,194
- Come on.
- Feishao, you fool. Stop there.

338
00:24:30,315 --> 00:24:31,755
- So clumsy.
- Should we go help them?

339
00:24:31,755 --> 00:24:37,555
- Chase. It can run so fast.
- Hurry to the back.

340
00:24:37,555 --> 00:24:41,255
- Why are you so clumsy? Together.
- Just block for me. Won't that do?

341
00:24:41,255 --> 00:24:43,440
- I take the left. You take the right.
- Alright. Come on.

342
00:24:47,955 --> 00:24:50,715
You're so skilled.
It seems to like you a lot.

343
00:24:52,434 --> 00:24:54,955
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

344
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:02,075
Really? Even animals can't resist you!

345
00:25:02,075 --> 00:25:04,475
That's what he gets.
Not something you can have.

346
00:25:05,874 --> 00:25:09,675
Can I go to another department?
He disses me every day.

347
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,914
Go ahead, but there'll be
even more people dissing you.

348
00:25:14,715 --> 00:25:19,035
The sharp-tongued ones, Zhou Zheng
and Feng Yasong. Real headache.

349
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:33,194
- It's really hot.
- There are quite a few tea shops.

350
00:25:33,194 --> 00:25:35,275
They have
handmade brittle candies there.

351
00:25:35,461 --> 00:25:37,235
(Zhuang Handmade Brittle Candies)

352
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:41,274
Let's go buy some. Some people in studio
didn't come due to some family matters.

353
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:44,215
- I'll buy some specialties for them.
- I'll buy some for my family too.

354
00:25:44,215 --> 00:25:47,514
- One of my roommates is your fan.
- May I try it?

355
00:25:47,514 --> 00:25:48,315
- Try any.
- Really?

356
00:25:50,235 --> 00:25:51,495
It's quite pretty.

357
00:25:51,495 --> 00:25:53,555
- Let's have a taste first.
- Okay.

358
00:25:59,504 --> 00:26:00,208
Is it tasty?

359
00:26:01,354 --> 00:26:03,474
Yeah, very tasty.

360
00:26:03,474 --> 00:26:06,874
- How much is the osmanthus cake?
- 28 for a box which contains 20 pieces.

361
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:10,215
- I'd like ten bags.
- Okay.

362
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:13,974
- Take some home as well.
- You're so generous?

363
00:26:13,974 --> 00:26:18,635
Thank you two for helping Sheng
accomplish her first live performance

364
00:26:18,635 --> 00:26:22,115
that created a record
with millions of people watching.

365
00:26:22,115 --> 00:26:25,675
Going by what you said, we should
buy something for Shengshengman.

366
00:26:25,675 --> 00:26:28,775
- After all, she did backing vocals.
- Thanks for offering such timely help.

367
00:26:28,775 --> 00:26:32,475
You'll have plenty of chances
to thank her, but now it's my chance.

368
00:26:35,114 --> 00:26:36,674
- Cut the formality.
- Alright.

369
00:26:37,755 --> 00:26:38,955
Let's go and have a look over there.

370
00:26:38,955 --> 00:26:40,434
- Is that tasty?
- It's quite tasty.

371
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,794
- What flavor is this?
- It's rose-flavored.

372
00:26:42,794 --> 00:26:44,794
- Try some.
- This tastes good.

373
00:26:44,794 --> 00:26:46,615
- Ten bags, please.
- Okay.

374
00:26:46,615 --> 00:26:47,315
Try this.

375
00:26:48,555 --> 00:26:51,035
Our local specialty has been around
since the Qing Dynasty.

376
00:26:52,315 --> 00:26:55,034
- This one is a must-buy.
- Then ten bags of this too.

377
00:26:55,034 --> 00:26:55,715
Okay.

378
00:27:00,475 --> 00:27:00,874
You eat.

379
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:04,834
Like matcha-flavored one?

380
00:27:09,874 --> 00:27:10,515
Come here.

381
00:27:12,634 --> 00:27:16,275
- It's early to stroll around here.
- Yes, and the shops ahead seem similar.

382
00:27:16,275 --> 00:27:18,154
- Really?
- Is this okay?

383
00:27:19,434 --> 00:27:21,594
This is the place where we are gonna
show gratitude to you.

384
00:27:24,715 --> 00:27:28,534
- How is it?
- You're embarrassing me.

385
00:27:28,534 --> 00:27:33,075
Just relax. He's just using you
as an excuse to drink.

386
00:27:34,275 --> 00:27:36,295
- I'll go check for a table inside.
- Okay.

387
00:27:36,295 --> 00:27:39,914
- You guys drink. I won't.
- Can you drink?

388
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:44,715
- I can try a little.
- Then drink a little. Let's go.

389
00:27:46,075 --> 00:27:47,315
- Just put it here.
- Come on.

390
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:49,515
A soft drink.

391
00:27:51,154 --> 00:27:52,114
- Go.
- Go.

392
00:27:54,594 --> 00:27:55,874
- The menu, please.
- Wait a moment.

393
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,254
- Sheng, do you drink alcohol normally?
- Let me look.

394
00:27:58,254 --> 00:28:02,874
To tell the truth, I'm very grateful.
Only you can handle him.

395
00:28:05,275 --> 00:28:10,674
You're more like good friends
than a couple.

396
00:28:12,795 --> 00:28:14,874
Do you feel shy because you just
started your relationship?

397
00:28:17,168 --> 00:28:18,384
What would you like to drink?

398
00:28:19,515 --> 00:28:20,154
Fine.

399
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,674
Hello, five of these, please.

400
00:28:38,864 --> 00:28:39,674
The same.

401
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,496
(Yitian West Street)

402
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:56,394
- Cheers.
- May our studio get better and better.

403
00:28:56,394 --> 00:28:57,434
Don't drink too fast.

404
00:29:04,755 --> 00:29:08,035
He said he wouldn't drink but ended up
being drunk like this again.

405
00:29:10,288 --> 00:29:13,655
- Should we take him to...
- Alright. I'll take him to throw up.

406
00:29:13,655 --> 00:29:16,555
Feishao, it's time to go on stage.

407
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:21,034
- Which song to sing?
- White Horse into Reed. Let's go.

408
00:29:21,034 --> 00:29:22,655
I'll take you to the stage.

409
00:29:22,655 --> 00:29:24,435
- Can you do it on your own?
- Yes, it's alright.

410
00:29:24,435 --> 00:29:26,235
- Come on. Take it slow.
- Be careful.

411
00:29:26,235 --> 00:29:27,914
Lean on me. Let's go.

412
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,755
This is hawthorn-flavored.

413
00:29:35,194 --> 00:29:37,154
I've noticed
that you can hold your liquor well.

414
00:29:39,634 --> 00:29:42,634
Nobody can tell if I'm drunk.

415
00:29:45,275 --> 00:29:49,655
- Are you now?
- Not now.

416
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:55,135
If I am, I'll say a lot of words.

417
00:29:55,135 --> 00:30:02,375
I'll be blunt, and others can't tell.
And I'll say whatever I want to say.

418
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:03,834
What do you want to say now?

419
00:30:14,352 --> 00:30:15,194
Did you intend

420
00:30:17,091 --> 00:30:18,050
to kiss me on the day

421
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,290
of the performance?

422
00:30:41,611 --> 00:30:42,411
What do you think?

423
00:30:45,651 --> 00:30:47,171
I think

424
00:30:48,851 --> 00:30:49,290
that it is.

425
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,490
If you say so, then it is.

426
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,931
I'm asking you. You should answer me.

427
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:06,411
It really smells like hawthorn.

428
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,010
Now?

429
00:31:27,171 --> 00:31:27,770
No.

430
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,490
Of course not in public.

431
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:43,490
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, he just threw up.

432
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:49,511
- You carry Feishao. I pay the bill.
- No way. My treat.

433
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:53,424
How can I let you pay for my first time
drinking with my girlfriend?

434
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:56,171
Fine, you always have a reason.

435
00:31:56,171 --> 00:31:58,290
Stand properly.

436
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,210
Let me carry the bag.
Wait a moment. Okay.

437
00:32:04,171 --> 00:32:07,770
- Pick up the things.
- Here you go.

438
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:10,311
- Then we're heading outside slowly.
- Okay.

439
00:32:10,311 --> 00:32:11,450
- You guys hurry up.
- Okay.

440
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,411
Do you want to drink more?

441
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,048
- Want more to drink?
- No.

442
00:32:29,168 --> 00:32:32,770
Aren't we waiting for Wang Ke to return?
When they return, we will leave.

443
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:35,571
Right.

444
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:52,656
(You guys go ahead and call a ride back.
I will wait a little longer.)

445
00:32:55,131 --> 00:32:57,250
Alright. Then we'll go back.

446
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:06,891
With such a low tolerance,
why were you bragging?

447
00:33:06,891 --> 00:33:11,811
- We can't get a cab here.
- Let me sing a song for you.

448
00:33:11,811 --> 00:33:15,391
No. Carrying you is embarrassing enough.
Please don't sing. I'm begging you.

449
00:33:15,391 --> 00:33:23,611
Silver bowl filled with snow,
bright moon hides the heron.

450
00:33:23,611 --> 00:33:27,631
Sing but hold on tight,
or you'll fall off.

451
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:31,210
Sounds of the flute. Travelers...

452
00:33:39,411 --> 00:33:42,931
- Why haven't they come back yet?
- They've already left.

453
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:45,171
They've gone back?

454
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:50,050
- Are you sober now?
- I'm not drunk.

455
00:33:52,651 --> 00:33:56,611
- The drink was good. Did you have some?
- Yes, I did.

456
00:33:56,611 --> 00:34:01,610
Why did they leave? Who will take
our candies now that they have left?

457
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,690
- Don't worry. Be careful.
- The candies...

458
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,050
Are you alright?

459
00:34:10,891 --> 00:34:11,610
This is not right.

460
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:18,251
It should be like this.

461
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:23,610
Okay.

462
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,691
- Let's go this way.
- Right.

463
00:34:33,691 --> 00:34:36,530
- Can I ask you a question?
- Go ahead.

464
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:41,050
Do I look good?

465
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:04,291
Yes, undoubtedly.

466
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:23,891
I think so too.

467
00:35:37,811 --> 00:35:38,288
Your turn.

468
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,951
- South Wind.
- A good hand.

469
00:35:42,951 --> 00:35:44,030
- A bad hand.
- Three of bamboo.

470
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,891
- Pong.
- Pong.

471
00:35:45,891 --> 00:35:47,971
- You can't tell her.
- You can see both of their tiles.

472
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:50,651
- She can't play. Can't I help her?
- Play it yourself.

473
00:35:50,651 --> 00:35:51,671
- Who?
- Open the door.

474
00:35:51,671 --> 00:35:52,211
Who is there?

475
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,030
- Open the door.
- Hurry up. Pong or not?

476
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,130
- Help him.
- Who is it?

477
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,650
- What happened?
- Did he get beaten up?

478
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:02,090
- He's just drunk. Give a hand, now.
- How much did he drink?

479
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,191
Come on.

480
00:36:03,191 --> 00:36:06,211
- Take him into the room.
- No, don't go inside the room.

481
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:08,851
- White sheets. Put him on the couch.
- The couch.

482
00:36:08,851 --> 00:36:10,050
- How stingy you are.
- Be careful.

483
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,530
Wait. His head.

484
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:16,411
- A couple's suite ended up like this.
- He fell down.

485
00:36:16,411 --> 00:36:18,810
- How much did he drink?
- Not much.

486
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:23,511
- Didn't Mr. Mo go with you?
- They went to somewhere else.

487
00:36:23,511 --> 00:36:26,371
- Somewhere else?
- To bask in the moonlight.

488
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:29,831
- Share the local specialties later on.
- Basking in the moonlight.

489
00:36:29,831 --> 00:36:34,610
- Leave some for Xiaoxing and Sheng.
- Including me?

490
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,650
They were bought
by your roommate's boyfriend.

491
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:42,411
- Mr. Qiang is so nice.
- He has a truly high EQ.

492
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:43,871
- Let me take a look.
- Look later.

493
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:46,331
- Continue to play.
- Come on. Whose turn was it just now?

494
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:47,931
- The three of bamboo.
- Pong or not?

495
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:49,530
- Pong.
- You need to flip it out.

496
00:36:51,691 --> 00:36:55,090
I started practicing the piano
four hours every day as a kid.

497
00:36:56,570 --> 00:37:01,250
I cried and even ran away from home,
but my parents never gave in.

498
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:06,671
Later, when I was upset, I could easily
play and compose a piece of music.

499
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:08,211
I started being truly grateful
to my parents.

500
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:11,871
- Be careful.
- Think about it.

501
00:37:11,871 --> 00:37:17,211
If I didn't learn it, I couldn't compose
and I wouldn't be Shengshengman.

502
00:37:17,211 --> 00:37:22,830
If I weren't Shengshengman,
I wouldn't have joined online clubs,

503
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,851
- Nor would I've had my voice chat room.
- Be careful.

504
00:37:27,691 --> 00:37:38,211
I also wouldn't have chatted
with Xiaoxing in the room that morning

505
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,530
and then met you.

506
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:47,024
- So I should thank my parents, right?
- Right.

507
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:54,411
Why were you
in my voice chat room that day?

508
00:37:55,931 --> 00:37:56,650
You want to know?

509
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,610
At first, I was wondering too.

510
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:14,331
Wondering why I suddenly had
some spare time and was browsing online.

511
00:38:15,891 --> 00:38:17,450
Wondering

512
00:38:19,211 --> 00:38:20,450
why I just happened

513
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,331
to enter your voice chat room.

514
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,691
Aren't you happy about it?

515
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:30,931
An unexpected delight.

516
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,650
Yeah.

517
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:37,371
Why?

518
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:40,931
It's destined.

519
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:49,490
- Young man, over here.
- Coming.

520
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:59,011
- The hot tea and blanket are all ready.
- Okay, thank you.

521
00:38:59,011 --> 00:39:03,170
- What are these preparations for?
- A night cruise on the Lijing River.

522
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,970
- We have a flight tomorrow morning.
- I know.

523
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:12,720
With me here, you can rest assured.

524
00:39:13,776 --> 00:39:15,371
Did you forget who woke you up that day?

525
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:18,331
Let's go.

526
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:20,411
Be careful.

527
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:24,291
Slow down.

528
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,851
Put on this life jacket.

529
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:44,411
Sit.

530
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:56,331
- All set, sir.
- Okay, let's sail.

531
00:39:59,851 --> 00:40:03,331
- Isn't there an engine?
- He was afraid it'd be too noisy

532
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:09,270
and asked me if there is another way
to propel the bamboo raft.

533
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:15,651
In the era without engines,
didn't people use poles to paddle?

534
00:40:15,651 --> 00:40:17,970
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Hang on.

535
00:40:24,848 --> 00:40:26,192
- I have drawn it.
- You won again.

536
00:40:26,192 --> 00:40:31,050
- How come you always win?
- I must have a lucky star.

537
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,211
With you by my side, I keep winning.

538
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,331
Look at yourself.

539
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:42,111
What's wrong? I'm a lucky star,
but I didn't cheat, so why the stare?

540
00:40:42,111 --> 00:40:47,110
- You do have some integrity.
- Yes, businessmen care about Fengshui.

541
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,231
Those who have a thriving business
are seen as lucky stars.

542
00:40:49,231 --> 00:40:52,131
I don't like what you're saying.
I'm a businessman too. Why didn't I win?

543
00:40:52,131 --> 00:40:54,490
Because he's more powerful than you.

544
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:01,731
- Is there any water?
- No. The water's been cut off.

545
00:41:01,731 --> 00:41:07,671
- Your logistics are getting worse.
- Look how drunk he is.

546
00:41:07,671 --> 00:41:09,488
- Focus on tiles.
- He's forgotten we're in Yangshuo.

547
00:41:09,488 --> 00:41:12,170
- Come on. Continue.
- Here's a bottle of water.

548
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:23,090
It's so comfortable here.

549
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:25,691
It's very quiet.

550
00:41:38,691 --> 00:41:45,551
The water here is shallow and safe.
Take your time and appreciate the view.

551
00:41:45,551 --> 00:41:47,371
If you're tired, just sleep.

552
00:41:48,931 --> 00:41:49,490
Thank you.

553
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:25,371
The osmanthus-flavored food I've eaten
these days makes me smell like it.
