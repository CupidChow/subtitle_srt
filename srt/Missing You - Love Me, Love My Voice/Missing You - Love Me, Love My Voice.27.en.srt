- He won't let me eat it.
- You eat it raw?

27
00:01:55,876 --> 00:01:56,637
Don't talk to me!

28
00:01:58,037 --> 00:01:58,832
Does it smell good?

29
00:02:04,837 --> 00:02:06,156
You know what it's like to be ignored?

30
00:02:07,516 --> 00:02:11,517
If you know you're ignored,
then accept it.

31
00:02:16,156 --> 00:02:16,676
Here.

32
00:02:33,316 --> 00:02:34,797
- Need help?
- I'm fine.

33
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:45,916
- Okay, next.
- Come on, next.

34
00:02:48,117 --> 00:02:49,237
- You're back!
- You're back!

35
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:50,036
We're back!

36
00:02:52,077 --> 00:02:55,277
- What a nice smell!
- Calm down a bit.

37
00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:57,156
You will smell this fragrance all night.

38
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,476
- Mr. Mo is cooking pig's feet.
- Really?

39
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:02,196
I'm so hungry!

40
00:03:02,997 --> 00:03:06,237
It seems like
we can't use the kitchen today.

41
00:03:06,756 --> 00:03:08,036
Certainly not.

42
00:03:10,756 --> 00:03:14,397
- Then we can order some skewers.
- Skewers! Nice!

43
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:16,596
- Right?
- Who wants to order skewers?

44
00:03:17,316 --> 00:03:18,557
- Mao!
- Order more!

45
00:03:18,557 --> 00:03:20,156
- Order more, seriously!
- We're starving.

46
00:03:20,277 --> 00:03:22,036
Your hearings are really sharp.

47
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:27,916
Only skewers can make up for our pain
of seeing but not being able to eat.

48
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,436
You can smell them before we even order?

49
00:03:31,636 --> 00:03:32,677
Why has the chef come out?

50
00:03:32,997 --> 00:03:35,677
Two stoves, simmer for an hour.
I'll take a little rest.

51
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,636
The chef also wants to eat barbecue,
huh?

52
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:49,797
You haven't slept much this week,
have you?

53
00:03:51,156 --> 00:03:52,517
- It's alright.
- It's okay.

54
00:03:53,397 --> 00:03:56,476
What do you think?
It's not easy to be the chief director!

55
00:03:56,596 --> 00:03:57,397
Chief planner.

56
00:04:05,196 --> 00:04:06,636
- It smells good.
- Here.

57
00:04:14,156 --> 00:04:14,957
Done.

58
00:04:23,157 --> 00:04:25,836
- It's ready to be served.
- Okay, I'll go get the lunch box.

59
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:31,076
Wanna taste it?

60
00:04:33,677 --> 00:04:35,636
I thought you wouldn't
allow me to eat it.

61
00:04:37,636 --> 00:04:39,196
This is a pot
privately kept by the chef.

62
00:04:56,477 --> 00:04:58,396
- Go eat in secret.
- Okay.

63
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:18,516
It's delicious, just a bit spicy.

64
00:05:19,956 --> 00:05:21,477
There's no rice left.
I'll get you some water.

65
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:38,956
Wait until I finish this bite.

66
00:05:41,037 --> 00:05:43,196
If you like it,
I'll cook more for you in the future.

67
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:48,196
You don't understand. It's most memorable
when you taste it for the first time.

68
00:05:51,836 --> 00:05:54,157
- Eat slowly.
- Do you need...

69
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:56,836
Help?

70
00:05:59,157 --> 00:06:01,072
You're stealing good food!

71
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:05,357
This was meant to be your midnight snack.
Hurry up and take it out.

72
00:06:06,037 --> 00:06:07,557
That's better. Take it.

73
00:06:08,276 --> 00:06:10,477
I'll take it away first.
Mu, the chopsticks.

74
00:06:12,157 --> 00:06:13,797
Guys, our midnight snack is here!

75
00:06:14,836 --> 00:06:16,636
- Didn't you say it's not allowed?
- Water.

76
00:06:23,276 --> 00:06:23,917
Have a try.

77
00:06:32,597 --> 00:06:33,276
It's not bad.

78
00:06:34,557 --> 00:06:35,836
Praising yourself, huh?

79
00:06:36,956 --> 00:06:38,196
Don't I deserve to be praised?

80
00:06:39,237 --> 00:06:42,117
You do. You're
the most deserving person in the world.

81
00:06:43,956 --> 00:06:47,196
Eat a bit more. You still have to
work later into the night.

82
00:07:12,836 --> 00:07:15,717
Mao, can you hear me?

83
00:07:17,597 --> 00:07:22,876
- Turn up the feedback volume a little.
- Alright, give me a moment.

84
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,357
- Try it again.
- Okay.

85
00:07:33,357 --> 00:07:36,677
Everyone,
this is our final technical rehearsal.

86
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:39,677
Let's all cheer up. Let's do it
like it's the real thing, okay?

87
00:07:41,677 --> 00:07:45,196
- Cheer up, okay?
- Okay!

88
00:07:45,276 --> 00:07:47,076
- Okay!
- Okay, Mr. Juemei!

89
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:47,997
- You're on.
- Okay.

90
00:07:47,997 --> 00:07:48,677
I'll go down there.

91
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,597
- Everyone, get ready.
- I'll listen down there.

92
00:07:52,037 --> 00:07:55,196
- Guai, are you nervous?
- No, I'm excited.

93
00:07:55,797 --> 00:08:00,917
- Good, you are a true master.
- They're all my seniors, I wouldn't dare.

94
00:08:01,316 --> 00:08:05,636
I was excited to watch your Yangshuo live,
busy with bullet chatting

95
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:08,272
about Zhaozhaomumu Music Studio
and Shengshengman.

96
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:11,076
I never thought
I'd be sitting on stage today.

97
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:15,797
This is much bigger
than the one in Yangshuo.

98
00:08:18,677 --> 00:08:22,237
- Just kidding.
- Right. It's a grand gala today.

99
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:23,477
That's right.

100
00:08:24,516 --> 00:08:25,477
Okay, get ready.

101
00:08:26,224 --> 00:08:28,357
Everyone, get ready.

102
00:08:36,556 --> 00:08:38,276
Let's go. It's time.

103
00:08:43,676 --> 00:08:45,396
Come on, let's take a picture.

104
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:49,357
That's him!

105
00:09:03,957 --> 00:09:05,796
- This row, thank you.
- That row.

106
00:09:06,156 --> 00:09:06,756
Thank you.

107
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:11,837
Here!

108
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:13,676
- Reserve a seat for Gu Sheng.
- OK.

109
00:09:15,957 --> 00:09:16,636
It's so big!

110
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:18,544
There are so many people!

111
00:09:18,544 --> 00:09:20,197
- So many.
- It's so big and beautiful.

112
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:22,396
- Look at this.
- Look, there's gauze above.

113
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:25,036
- It's very traditional.
- The stage is so big.

115
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:30,276
- What's this?
- It's for you. Take it.

116
00:09:32,077 --> 00:09:33,477
Hold it high later.

117
00:09:37,597 --> 00:09:40,437
- Hello.
- Do you sit here?

118
00:09:40,477 --> 00:09:43,837
- There's a song today composed by Sheng.
- Really?

119
00:09:45,197 --> 00:09:47,636
- What's it called?
- It's called Qi Yu.

120
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:51,556
- I'll tell you when it's time.
- That's great.

is so beautiful.

00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:19,756
Yes!

Hurry up! Don't delay, I told you!
The show has started, there's no time!

126
00:10:24,636 --> 00:10:26,676
- I'm sorry! Excuse me!
- It's okay. Be careful.

128
00:10:28,957 --> 00:10:29,957

00:15:18,396 --> 00:15:19,597
- My name is on it!
- Right.

198
00:15:24,317 --> 00:15:26,676
Qi Yu! This is it!

199
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:33,437
Singing this song for the first time
on this stage shows her fondness for it.

200
00:15:34,676 --> 00:15:37,676
My composition skills are quite good,
Mr. Qiang Qingci.

I'm even more excited than
when I saw Sheng on stage in Yangshuo.

207
00:16:09,717 --> 00:16:12,997
Of course, she sang harmony last time.
But this is a song she wrote herself,

208
00:16:13,156 --> 00:16:15,636
and Linglong sings.
It certainly feels different!

209
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:19,556
Also! The music is composed by Sheng,
and the lyrics are proposed by Off Key.

210
00:16:19,597 --> 00:16:21,197
That girl in the folk music ensemble
is Guai.

211
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:22,837
We've got three people
contributed to the song.

212
00:16:22,837 --> 00:16:24,396
- Which one?
- The one playing the guzheng.

213
00:16:24,556 --> 00:16:27,077
- I was too excited to introduce her.
- That girl! Super cool!

214
00:16:27,077 --> 00:16:28,036
Exactly!

At today's fine feast,
our joy is hard to fully express.

227
00:17:21,397 --> 00:17:24,556
The zither sounds lively.
A new song is introduced wonderfully.

228
00:17:24,556 --> 00:17:27,516
- Sheng is incredible!
- Thanks for the song Linglong brought us,

229
00:17:27,516 --> 00:17:29,677
- the dreamlike Qi Yu.
- So beautiful!

230
00:17:29,677 --> 00:17:30,677
It's well written, too.

231
00:17:31,377 --> 00:17:33,168
- Let's enjoy the next performance.
- Let's head backstage.

232
00:17:36,036 --> 00:17:38,917
- Off Key!
- Sheng!

233
00:17:40,197 --> 00:17:41,036
Did you just see that?

234
00:17:42,157 --> 00:17:46,397
It's just wonderful!
Miss Linglong is truly stunning!

235
00:17:46,877 --> 00:17:48,397
- Mr. Mo.
- Alright.

236
00:17:49,157 --> 00:17:51,556
- Are you ready to go on stage?
- The next one.

237
00:17:51,957 --> 00:17:52,717
Don't be nervous.

238
00:17:53,437 --> 00:17:55,356
By then,
all the lights offstage will be out.

239
00:17:55,637 --> 00:17:57,556
You just need to watch Mu
and the others perform on stage.

240
00:17:57,556 --> 00:18:00,917
Got it. I will definitely live up to
The Perfect Voice Studio and do you proud.

241
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:04,496
It's most important
to do justice to yourself.

242
00:18:06,556 --> 00:18:09,957
- Go for it!
- It's okay! We are all here for you.

243
00:18:10,997 --> 00:18:13,917
I cheered for you in Yangshuo,
now it's your turn to cheer for me.

244
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:16,197
I'll be cheering you on
from under the stage!

245
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:19,076
I'll join Xiaoxing and the others.

246
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,356
Go for it! Goodbye.

247
00:18:23,796 --> 00:18:25,516
- Let's go, I'll accompany you.
- Okay.

248
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:30,036
I'm still excited.

249
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:31,276
- Sheng!
- So good!

250
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,197
- You're amazing!
- Here!

251
00:18:34,276 --> 00:18:35,237
Come over here.

252
00:18:38,596 --> 00:18:40,316
Your song is really beautiful.

253
00:18:40,316 --> 00:18:43,717
It makes up for not going to Yangshuo
to see you perform last time.

254
00:18:43,796 --> 00:18:46,796
Let me tell you, this is the first time
my song is performed on stage.

255
00:18:46,957 --> 00:18:49,076
I'm more nervous
than when I was in Yangshuo.

256
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:53,237
It was fantastic. You were great,
and the chief planner did an amazing job.

257
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:55,036
And don't forget the chief director.

258
00:18:56,157 --> 00:18:57,596
I was really nervous just now.

259
00:18:57,717 --> 00:19:02,197
Up next is The Perfect Voice Studio,
presenting a dubbing clip.

260
00:19:02,556 --> 00:19:06,192
This clip is taken from last year's
dubbing drama, Memories of Jiangnan.

261
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:11,157
IEMs.

262
00:19:12,877 --> 00:19:13,316
Let's go.

263
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:26,477
Brother, Auntie wants to betroth me
to some man.

264
00:19:28,237 --> 00:19:29,316
I don't want to get married.

265
00:19:31,356 --> 00:19:32,976
If you can receive this letter,

266
00:19:34,036 --> 00:19:36,076
please find a way to get me out of this.

267
00:19:37,717 --> 00:19:38,556
If...

268
00:19:43,477 --> 00:19:44,796
If I must marry,

269
00:19:46,356 --> 00:19:48,556
I have decided
not to become a burden to you.

270
00:19:51,717 --> 00:19:53,877
If people find out
I am the sister of Shen Ce,

271
00:19:57,637 --> 00:19:59,796
I will certainly take my own life.

272
00:20:06,677 --> 00:20:09,717
Quick, someone wants to see you.
Your brother sent someone to pick you up.

273
00:20:19,796 --> 00:20:20,437
Brother.

274
00:20:25,276 --> 00:20:26,397
Do you still recognize me?

275
00:20:29,116 --> 00:20:32,516
I still love how you ran over by yourself
when you were a kid.

276
00:20:39,836 --> 00:20:41,116
I've got nothing.

277
00:20:42,316 --> 00:20:43,568
Only good news of winning battles.

278
00:20:44,624 --> 00:20:46,116
All good news of winning battles.

279
00:20:47,796 --> 00:20:51,516
They're about to marry me off
and all you do is war.

280
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:57,437
You said,

281
00:20:58,756 --> 00:20:59,877
wherever I am,

282
00:21:01,116 --> 00:21:02,157
you will be there.

283
00:21:04,528 --> 00:21:06,397
It was all lie.

284
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,076
My hard-earned reputation
is almost wiped out by you.

285
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:24,796
Time is of the essence.
There is no time for lengthy explanations.

286
00:21:24,957 --> 00:21:27,556
- Can't you even stay for a while?
- No.

287
00:21:28,477 --> 00:21:32,677
- Then the next time...
- You can't stay there since it is exposed.

288
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,717
You want to take me back
to the military?

289
00:21:37,237 --> 00:21:39,316
Yes, I'm taking you with me.

290
00:22:00,796 --> 00:22:01,756
We are home.

291
00:22:03,717 --> 00:22:04,437
Zhaozhao.

292
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,397
They changed clothes too quickly!

293
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:15,437
We joined the army to defend our homeland,
and to avenge our families.

294
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,116
I am just like you.

295
00:22:19,152 --> 00:22:20,336
There's no difference.

296
00:22:21,392 --> 00:22:22,736
We all have the same concerns

297
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:25,116
and the same aspirations.

298
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:27,248
Today,

299
00:22:28,276 --> 00:22:33,036
I found my younger sister Shen Zhaozhao.
It is the greatest happiness of my life.

300
00:22:38,036 --> 00:22:40,592
This blade has been with me
for several years.

301
00:22:41,677 --> 00:22:43,664
It has slain emperor
and felled renowned generals,

302
00:22:44,717 --> 00:22:46,036
yet it has never had a name.

303
00:22:47,717 --> 00:22:52,036
- From now on, it shall be named Zhao.
- Amazing.

304
00:22:53,076 --> 00:22:54,516
May the fortune of this day

305
00:22:55,556 --> 00:22:56,656
reside with the blade.

306
00:22:57,717 --> 00:23:02,197
May my people in Chaisang
stay close to me like my kin.

307
00:23:02,556 --> 00:23:07,637
May Chaisang army guard the river for long
and remain undefeated in hundred battles.

308
00:23:07,957 --> 00:23:12,944
May the day come when we
finally drive out foreign tribes,

309
00:23:12,944 --> 00:23:16,596
and forever eliminate war and chaos.

310
00:23:18,836 --> 00:23:21,437
- So good!
- Good!

311
00:23:23,917 --> 00:23:25,637
- That's awesome!
- It's giving me goosebumps!

312
00:23:26,637 --> 00:23:27,596
That's fantastic!

313
00:23:32,157 --> 00:23:34,276
- Raise it higher, higher!
- That's enough!

314
00:23:34,397 --> 00:23:35,677
You have to let him see it!

315
00:23:47,477 --> 00:23:50,128
- Zhou Zheng!
- Feishao! - Doudou!

316
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:54,157
Thank you for attending
the Traditional Music Gala tonight.

317
00:23:54,197 --> 00:23:58,157
We also want to thank you
for continuous encouragement and support.

318
00:23:58,276 --> 00:24:01,796
We will strive to present
more excellent works in the future.

319
00:24:01,877 --> 00:24:04,316
- We'll...
- See you next year!

320
00:24:36,717 --> 00:24:38,157
Doudou looks so beautiful!

321
00:24:48,596 --> 00:24:51,796
- Encore!
- Encore!

322
00:24:51,917 --> 00:25:03,677
- Encore!
- Encore!

323
00:25:37,076 --> 00:25:38,356
This is Qiang Qingci, right?

324
00:25:40,877 --> 00:25:41,596

The traditional music gala tonight
has officially come to an end.

375
00:32:01,157 --> 00:32:05,796
Thank you very much for attending.
Please take all your personal belongings.

376
00:32:06,116 --> 00:32:09,276
Watch your steps.
And make a safe departure.

377
00:32:21,437 --> 00:32:21,877
Let's go.

378
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:25,877
Sheng.

379
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:27,756
He posted on Weibo.

380
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:30,960
(Guys,)

381
00:32:31,537 --> 00:32:32,677
(thank you for everything tonight.)

382
00:32:33,836 --> 00:32:34,637
(Starting from today,)

383
00:32:35,796 --> 00:32:40,976

will step back to the back stage.)

over the years.)

385
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:47,836
- (All is engraved in my heart.)
- You must be heartbreaking.

386
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:53,717
We had discussed
his retirement long ago.

387
00:32:54,512 --> 00:32:57,556
But I'm still upset
now that I saw his post.

388
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:08,076

396
00:33:48,796 --> 00:33:49,917

(What I want to say is,)

401
00:34:06,877 --> 00:34:10,397
do not fall too much for someone
because you are enchanted by the voice.

402
00:34:11,317 --> 00:34:16,596
(You will never know who it is
on the other side of the internet.)

403
00:34:16,716 --> 00:34:19,957
I just feel like I'm dreaming.

406

Everyone has emotions.

410
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:42,116
If we're meant to be separated,
it's better not to meet.

411
00:34:42,556 --> 00:34:44,766
(I used it for two years.)

412

I changed it.)

00:34:51,837 --> 00:34:52,837
it's only appropriate.

Don't mind me.

439
00:37:16,636 --> 00:37:20,716
My favorite Qiang Qingci
is about to retire.

440
00:37:21,676 --> 00:37:23,277
My heart is about to break.

441
00:37:31,236 --> 00:37:32,236
Actually,

442
00:37:34,716 --> 00:37:36,596
there's no such thing as retiring.

443
00:37:39,997 --> 00:37:41,156
In this circle,

444
00:37:44,877 --> 00:37:46,277
some people get tired,

445
00:37:49,317 --> 00:37:52,516
some are troubled by right and wrong,
and there are others

446
00:37:53,957 --> 00:37:55,556
who are busy with work in real life.

447
00:37:57,837 --> 00:37:59,344
They'll eventually leave
one after another.

448
00:38:06,196 --> 00:38:08,116
I don't want
to hear such formal expressions.

449
00:38:10,636 --> 00:38:11,917
As a fan,

450
00:38:13,957 --> 00:38:16,516
my heart is almost shattered to pieces.

451
00:38:19,357 --> 00:38:21,196
- It's alright.
- It's not alright anymore.

452
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:26,596
Okay.

453
00:38:28,116 --> 00:38:29,196
Then calm down a bit.

454
00:38:31,556 --> 00:38:32,437
Calm down.

455
00:38:33,636 --> 00:38:34,957
I can't calm down anymore.

456
00:38:35,957 --> 00:38:37,397
Is this how you comfort others?

457
00:38:39,156 --> 00:38:40,317
Then,

458
00:38:41,516 --> 00:38:42,757
let's go eat?

459
00:38:45,397 --> 00:38:46,797
That's all you've got.

460
00:38:49,636 --> 00:38:52,036
Who said that? It's not just that!

461
00:38:53,837 --> 00:39:00,957
I can also treat illnesses, cook,
do dubbing, and sing.

462
00:39:02,437 --> 00:39:04,076
And I can fish too.

463
00:39:06,116 --> 00:39:08,997
- And also...
- And also play the guitar.

464
00:39:09,397 --> 00:39:11,636
Yes, I can also play the guitar.

465
00:39:13,156 --> 00:39:17,357
Don't tease me.
You need to respect me as a fan.

466
00:39:34,357 --> 00:39:34,997
Shengshengman.

467
00:39:39,196 --> 00:39:40,317
Qiang Qingci

468
00:39:44,236 --> 00:39:45,076
will never leave.

469
00:40:24,477 --> 00:40:25,716
You all are my friends.

470
00:40:31,277 --> 00:40:32,596
Every single person online,

471
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:39,156
as long as they have listened
to my dubbing

472
00:40:40,676 --> 00:40:41,676
and my song,

473
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:47,156
they are all my friends.

474
00:40:55,477 --> 00:40:56,917
I am actually not good at talking.

475
00:41:00,477 --> 00:41:01,317
So,

476
00:41:04,437 --> 00:41:05,957
I seldom speak online.

477
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:13,636
Sometimes,

478
00:41:16,877 --> 00:41:17,997
I'm afraid of my talking too much

479
00:41:20,156 --> 00:41:21,596
might be misinterpreted by others,

480
00:41:25,957 --> 00:41:26,928
causing trouble

481
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:28,917
to people who like me

482
00:41:30,437 --> 00:41:31,236
and people around me.

483
00:41:40,236 --> 00:41:41,797
But actually, I have a lot to say.

484
00:41:50,156 --> 00:41:51,236
I will also be reluctant

485
00:41:59,116 --> 00:41:59,917
and sad.

486
00:42:04,716 --> 00:42:05,957
Qiang Qingci,

487
00:42:07,357 --> 00:42:10,556
whether it's sadness or grief,

488
00:42:14,116 --> 00:42:15,036
Shengshengman

489
00:42:16,837 --> 00:42:17,877
will be always with you.

490
00:42:35,556 --> 00:42:36,196
Calm down now?

491
00:42:41,757 --> 00:42:42,397
Better.

492
00:42:44,917 --> 00:42:45,957
Then,

493
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:47,997
let's go eat something.

494
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:52,837
Let's go.

495
00:42:59,437 --> 00:43:01,837
- So good.
- Tasty!

496
00:43:02,757 --> 00:43:03,477
Here they are.

497
00:43:04,797 --> 00:43:05,957
Have you watched our show?

498
00:43:10,036 --> 00:43:11,116
Are they all inside?

499
00:43:14,636 --> 00:43:16,116
Then, why not go in?

500
00:43:21,957 --> 00:43:24,636
Because he is aware
and afraid of being pranked.

501
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:27,116
- Come in for the cake, here.
- We're waiting for you guys.

502
00:43:30,076 --> 00:43:33,997
