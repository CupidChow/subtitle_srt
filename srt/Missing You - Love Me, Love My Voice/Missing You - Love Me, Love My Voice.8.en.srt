25
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:44,948
(I like you a lot.
Will you be my girlfriend?)

26
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,627
I heard
that you signed a contract today.

27
00:02:04,308 --> 00:02:05,072
Yes, I did.

28
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:13,827
How was it? Did it go well?

29
00:02:15,388 --> 00:02:16,147
Very.

30
00:02:17,188 --> 00:02:19,600
It was kind of a thrill
to be fully trusted.

31
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:22,547
What a great partner indeed!

32
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:26,027
And, you know...

33
00:02:29,668 --> 00:02:30,508
What are you doing?

34
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:35,120
Get up early tomorrow
and buy groceries with me.

35
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:38,468
Let's finish recording the 20 lines
of the game's dialogue tonight.

36
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:40,720
Okay.

37
00:02:42,948 --> 00:02:43,600
Let's do it.

38
00:02:45,508 --> 00:02:47,628
We'll start in ten minutes.
I'll warm up first.

39
00:02:49,348 --> 00:02:51,388
Alright, time to get to work.

40
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:54,427
Here we go.

41
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:11,348
Mom, I'm not eating at home tonight.

42
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:15,987
The celery I bought today
is really fresh.

43
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,707
I was planning to make you some wontons.

44
00:03:17,707 --> 00:03:18,788
Are you going back to school?

45
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:21,904
I'm going to a classmate's place.

46
00:03:22,948 --> 00:03:24,948
Don't you need
to go back to school today?

47
00:03:24,948 --> 00:03:25,547
I have no classes.

48
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:27,468
No?

49
00:03:29,388 --> 00:03:33,388
Then go to the supermarket
and grab some snacks.

50
00:03:33,388 --> 00:03:36,508
You can't go to your classmate's place
empty-handed.

51
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,068
Okay. Thanks, mom. Gotta go.

52
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:53,232
(Jiayuan)

53
00:04:11,888 --> 00:04:12,468
Thank you.

54
00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:13,188
Don't mention it.

55
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,108
1602.

56
00:04:39,507 --> 00:04:41,067
East Wind!

57
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:43,067
Wait a minute. I think I won.

58
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:44,427
I've won. I've won.

59
00:04:44,427 --> 00:04:45,547
Wait, how did you win this?

60
00:04:45,547 --> 00:04:46,908
It's an East Wind, right?

61
00:04:46,908 --> 00:04:48,387
No, that's not correct.

62
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:49,747
You have Six and Seven, but not Nine.

63
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,307
This is a false win.

64
00:04:51,307 --> 00:04:52,788
I don't want to play with you anymore.

65
00:04:52,788 --> 00:04:54,708
- Somebody's ringing the doorbell.
- Who is it?

66
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:55,668
I'll go. It's the delivery.

67
00:04:55,668 --> 00:04:56,588
You go. Open the door.

68
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,747
What delivery?

69
00:04:57,747 --> 00:04:58,788
Who ordered it?

70
00:05:00,987 --> 00:05:03,828
Sheng, you've arrived so early.
Ah, you shouldn't have brought these.

71
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:05,507
We're playing mahjong.
Mo's in the kitchen.

72
00:05:05,507 --> 00:05:06,228
I'm killing them.

73
00:05:06,228 --> 00:05:07,908
- Sheng's here!
- Sheng's here!

74
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:08,867
Come in, Sheng.

75
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:09,987
Come on in.

76
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:10,987
Is it cold outside? Come in.

77
00:05:10,987 --> 00:05:11,668
You bought snacks.

78
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:13,387
Mo has specially prepared
these slippers for you.

79
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:15,627
Thank you.

80
00:05:15,627 --> 00:05:17,387
You two should learn from her.

81
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:19,947
You live off of others every day
without even contributing food.

82
00:05:19,947 --> 00:05:21,148
Give me the backpack.

83
00:05:21,148 --> 00:05:22,268
Okay, thank you.

84
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:25,507
Make yourself at home.

85
00:05:25,507 --> 00:05:27,747
If you keep playing like that,
I won't play with you anymore.

86
00:05:27,747 --> 00:05:29,968
Sheng is here.
Can we turn on the air conditioner now?

87
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:31,920
Of course. Turn it on.

88
00:05:32,947 --> 00:05:33,908
Well, now that Sheng's here.

89
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:35,947
That's purely a double standard.

90
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:38,867
Look, I'm frozen to death.

91
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:39,708
Come on, Sheng.

92
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:43,507
Try these strawberries.
I just washed them. They're very sweet.

93
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:44,547
Okay, thank you.

94
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,588
- They are really sweet.
- Right?

95
00:05:49,588 --> 00:05:52,627
Now that Sheng is here,
can we try some too?

96
00:05:52,627 --> 00:05:54,788
Okay, now you're allowed to have one.

97
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:57,307
- Thank you.
- Dirty hands.

98
00:05:57,307 --> 00:05:57,840
Right.

99
00:06:01,187 --> 00:06:02,987
Sheng, why don't you join us
to play mahjong?

100
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:03,708
Can you play?

101
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,228
Come on and try. You can replace him.

102
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:06,947
He had four false wins
out of five rounds.

103
00:06:06,947 --> 00:06:09,348
That's unbearable, you know?

104
00:06:10,588 --> 00:06:13,348
Why didn't you call me before coming up?

105
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:15,507
Someone opened the door downstairs.
So I came straight up.

106
00:06:16,547 --> 00:06:18,747
Isn't that good?
No need to be so formal.

107
00:06:18,747 --> 00:06:20,148
Exactly. Why so formal?

108
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:22,228
How will we get along in the future
if you are so formal?

109
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:23,187
You're not an outsider.

110
00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:24,507
Right.

111
00:06:24,507 --> 00:06:27,268
Sheng, do you want
to play mahjong with us

112
00:06:27,268 --> 00:06:28,987
or watch Mo cook?

113
00:06:28,987 --> 00:06:29,867
Play mahjong with us.

114
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:32,788
- Quick.
- Take my place.

115
00:06:32,788 --> 00:06:35,307
I think I'd better help
with the cooking.

116
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:40,148
Alright, then go.

117
00:06:40,148 --> 00:06:42,387
But I doubt you'll be of much help.

118
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:44,108
You can go inside
and just watch him cook.

119
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:46,128
Come in.

120
00:06:47,547 --> 00:06:48,228
What was that?

121
00:06:48,228 --> 00:06:50,668
What?
I told her to go in and take a break.

122
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:53,148
Can I help with anything?

123
00:06:53,148 --> 00:06:55,427
Actually, there is no need.

124
00:06:55,427 --> 00:06:57,788
I can wash and cut vegetables.

125
00:06:57,788 --> 00:07:00,028
Do you want to drink something?
There's orange juice in the fridge.

126
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,387
Okay.

127
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:03,668
- I want to drink too.
- Me too.

128
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:05,268
- Me too.
- I also want to drink orange juice.

129
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,947
There are four boxes of orange juice
in the fridge.

130
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:12,268
Help yourself if you want to drink it.

131
00:07:12,268 --> 00:07:13,468
If you don't, keep playing mahjong.

132
00:07:15,987 --> 00:07:17,547
What was the result
of the last round again?

133
00:07:17,547 --> 00:07:18,908
It was a false win. It's on him.

134
00:07:18,908 --> 00:07:20,427
You called a fake win,
and revealed my hand.

135
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:22,867
The cups are at the top.

136
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,228
Do you want some orange juice?

137
00:08:11,947 --> 00:08:12,668
Then...

138
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:16,228
My hands are occupied.

139
00:08:24,307 --> 00:08:25,148
Well.

140
00:08:45,348 --> 00:08:45,968
All right.

141
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:48,816
Thank you.

142
00:08:51,188 --> 00:08:51,728
You're welcome.

143
00:09:21,907 --> 00:09:22,548
Zhou Zheng.

144
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,428
Please clean the dining table.
We are about to start cooking.

145
00:09:27,428 --> 00:09:28,068
Sure.

146
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:31,828
Why not assign me something to do
as well?

147
00:09:33,747 --> 00:09:34,428
Are you sure?

148
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:37,328
Then let's cook.

149
00:09:38,548 --> 00:09:39,088
Okay.

150
00:09:40,387 --> 00:09:42,948
It's crispy-skinned fish
in chili sauce. It's quite simple.

151
00:09:44,348 --> 00:09:47,948
First, make slits on both sides
of the fish like this.

152
00:09:50,747 --> 00:09:51,428
On this side too.

153
00:09:59,787 --> 00:10:00,308
Okay.

154
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:06,428
Then add some salt to the mixture
of egg and starch prepared in advance.

155
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:06,948
About this much.

156
00:10:08,747 --> 00:10:12,188
After mixing,
apply it all over the fish.

157
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,387
When we start cooking later,

158
00:10:22,387 --> 00:10:24,627
just put the entire fish into the pan.

159
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:27,228
Fry it until it gets golden,
then take it out and put it on a plate.

160
00:10:28,348 --> 00:10:30,108
Leave some oil in the pan

161
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:32,667
to stir-fry minced ginger and garlic
until they become fragrant.

162
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:38,188
Then add chili, soy sauce, salt,
and sugar, and stir them well.

163
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:41,108
Finally, pour the mixture onto the fish
with chopped chives.

164
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:43,907
Isn't it simple?

165
00:10:45,588 --> 00:10:46,667
Did you remember it all?

166
00:10:48,387 --> 00:10:49,027
Almost.

167
00:10:58,387 --> 00:11:00,667
I am a doctor, you know.

168
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:03,747
Yes, I know.

169
00:11:05,228 --> 00:11:06,188
My parents are too.

170
00:11:08,188 --> 00:11:10,267
We're always very busy

171
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:11,867
and don't get to see each other often.

172
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:17,428
So when I have some spare time,
I start doing voice-acting.

173
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:24,828
I am not complicated.
I'm a simple person.

174
00:11:37,188 --> 00:11:39,267
Step back a bit.
Be careful not to burn yourself.

175
00:12:18,828 --> 00:12:21,588
See? It's the golden color we want.

176
00:12:21,588 --> 00:12:24,108
Don't fry it for too long,
or the fish will become tough.

177
00:12:37,828 --> 00:12:38,416
Sheng.

178
00:12:45,468 --> 00:12:47,987
The fish is fried until golden.

179
00:12:49,308 --> 00:12:54,507
Then stir-fry the ginger and garlic,
right?

180
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:13,428
I like you a lot.

181
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,428
Will you be my girlfriend?

182
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:37,507
I'm serious.

183
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:50,308
We've only met a few times.

184
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:52,147
It has nothing to do
with how many times we've met.

185
00:14:10,627 --> 00:14:11,627
What if

186
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:15,588
we're not suited for each other?

187
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,667
And what if we are?

188
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:22,387
If we don't start,

189
00:14:25,428 --> 00:14:26,627
we won't know the end,

190
00:14:31,588 --> 00:14:32,176
right?

191
00:14:58,308 --> 00:15:00,108
Use the oil from the bottom of the pan

192
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,907
to stir-fry the ginger and garlic.

193
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:21,867
Smells good?

194
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:26,627
Yes.

195
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:27,428
Eat more later.

196
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,000
Okay.

197
00:16:00,507 --> 00:16:02,987
The table is set. Need any help?

198
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:03,708
I'm almost done.

199
00:16:08,348 --> 00:16:09,667
Sheng, what's with your face?

200
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:14,267
Look at you, Mo.
You've even turned Sheng's face red

201
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:16,108
when frying the fish.

202
00:16:19,068 --> 00:16:20,708
Let me help you with the dishes.

203
00:16:26,468 --> 00:16:27,348
Well done, Mo.

204
00:16:27,348 --> 00:16:28,027
Okay.

205
00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:28,708
Here we go.

206
00:16:33,387 --> 00:16:35,507
- The food is coming.
- Nice.

207
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:38,588
Great presentation.

208
00:16:38,588 --> 00:16:40,627
Alright, you can go out and wait.
It's a bit smoky in here.

209
00:16:47,747 --> 00:16:48,747
Here, Sheng, sit down.

210
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:51,152
Come, Sheng. Sit between me and Doudou.

211
00:16:52,987 --> 00:16:56,147
Here, fish-flavored eggplant.
It goes really well with rice.

212
00:16:56,147 --> 00:16:57,747
This is really quite a feast.

213
00:16:57,747 --> 00:17:00,144
There are even three to four soups.

214
00:17:01,267 --> 00:17:04,348
We have braised pork ribs
and braised clams.

215
00:17:04,348 --> 00:17:06,768
And conch soup
and pork stomach and chicken soup.

216
00:17:07,867 --> 00:17:10,788
He even cooked bamboo shoot soup.
Oh, my goodness.

217
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:12,427
(All the dishes
that we've talked about.)

218
00:17:12,427 --> 00:17:15,227
This is steamed fish with chili.

219
00:17:15,227 --> 00:17:15,792
Right.

220
00:17:16,947 --> 00:17:18,387
It's crispy-skinned fish in chili sauce.

221
00:17:18,387 --> 00:17:21,136
- You two, stop creating names for dishes.
- Don't pretend to know it all.

222
00:17:21,136 --> 00:17:22,187
She knows better than you.

223
00:17:22,187 --> 00:17:23,792
Yeah, that's true.

224
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:27,427
Today, we can eat so many tasty dishes,
mainly because of Sheng.

225
00:17:27,427 --> 00:17:30,147
Sheng, how did you first get
into the traditional music circle?

226
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:33,508
Initially, a friend asked me

227
00:17:33,508 --> 00:17:36,627
to rearrange a piece of music for her.

228
00:17:36,627 --> 00:17:38,227
Then I came to know about this circle.

229
00:17:39,748 --> 00:17:42,828
So did you join a club
or were you on your own

230
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,600
at the very beginning?

231
00:17:44,656 --> 00:17:46,387
I was alone at first.

232
00:17:46,387 --> 00:17:50,748
Then the club leader approached me
after listening to several of my pieces.

233
00:17:50,748 --> 00:17:52,707
And then I joined the club.

234
00:17:52,707 --> 00:17:54,227
You're indeed talented.

235
00:17:54,227 --> 00:17:55,947
Her works are quite famous.

236
00:17:55,947 --> 00:17:58,627
Yes, I know.
We've probably all heard them.

237
00:17:58,627 --> 00:17:59,788
Yes, we have.

238
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,548
We've all heard 'Return With You',
right?

239
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:04,187
Besides, it's rare to find someone

240
00:18:04,187 --> 00:18:07,147
who can both compose and arrange music.
And she can also sing.

241
00:18:07,147 --> 00:18:10,427
How should I put it?
She's like an all-in-one machine.

242
00:18:10,427 --> 00:18:12,108
A rare genius.

243
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:14,108
What metaphor is that?
An all-in-one machine?

244
00:18:14,108 --> 00:18:17,667
My singing really can't compare
with that of professionals.

245
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:19,988
I mainly compose and arrange.

246
00:18:19,988 --> 00:18:21,627
You're being too modest.

247
00:18:21,627 --> 00:18:21,988
Right.

248
00:18:21,988 --> 00:18:23,308
How great it is to be able to compose!

249
00:18:23,308 --> 00:18:25,508
Many clubs don't have composers.

250
00:18:25,508 --> 00:18:25,748
Right.

251
00:18:25,748 --> 00:18:26,960
Your club leader is really lucky.

252
00:18:28,028 --> 00:18:31,627
I'll take the liberty to call the shots.
Sheng, you should join us.

253
00:18:31,627 --> 00:18:33,788
There's not only a dubbing club
at Tianzi No. 1 Recording Studio.

254
00:18:33,788 --> 00:18:37,108
We also have a traditional music club,
and the two of us are the leaders.

255
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:39,788
Right, we're both leaders.

256
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:43,548
Sorry. I'm really close
to the people in my club.

257
00:18:43,548 --> 00:18:44,627
Just come to our place...

258
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:46,627
That's okay, Sheng.
They're just kidding.

259
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:47,627
Stop talking nonsense.

260
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:50,427
Not only is her club leader lucky,

261
00:18:50,427 --> 00:18:52,548
but they also have a keen eye.
We are not that fortunate.

262
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,588
We can only envy.
We haven't found anyone like her.

263
00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:57,387
Here, the food is ready.

264
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,268
- Thank you, Mo.
- Quickly join us.

265
00:18:59,268 --> 00:19:00,867
Shrimp-stuffed okra.

266
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,108
Thanks for all the food.

267
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:04,752
This is a feast.

268
00:19:05,788 --> 00:19:08,427
Well, let me say a few words.

269
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:10,467
Thanks to Sheng,

270
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:13,627
we could have such a feast

271
00:19:13,627 --> 00:19:15,548
prepared by Mo.

272
00:19:15,548 --> 00:19:16,387
Well said.

273
00:19:16,387 --> 00:19:17,907
Here's a toast to all.

274
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,108
- Okay. Cheers!
- Cheers!

275
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:20,707
Thank you, Sheng.

276
00:19:20,707 --> 00:19:22,308
- Thank you, Sheng.
- Thank you, Sheng.

277
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:23,667
It feels like we are at your home.

278
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:28,907
Let's start eating.

279
00:19:28,907 --> 00:19:30,508
I'll help myself.

280
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:31,947
It's been a long time
since I've had fish.

281
00:19:31,947 --> 00:19:33,387
Didn't you say it smelled good?
Eat more.

282
00:19:36,867 --> 00:19:38,788
The bamboo shoot soup you made

283
00:19:38,788 --> 00:19:40,828
tastes just like the one at Wang's.

284
00:19:40,828 --> 00:19:41,627
Try some.

285
00:19:41,627 --> 00:19:42,160
I'll try it.

286
00:19:56,548 --> 00:19:57,108
Is it good?

287
00:20:03,508 --> 00:20:05,907
Aren't you guys eating?
If not, Mo will eat all the fish.

288
00:20:07,028 --> 00:20:08,068
Hurry.

289
00:20:08,068 --> 00:20:11,467
Mo's fish is second to none
in the world.

290
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:12,508
It's tasty.

291
00:20:12,508 --> 00:20:13,068
Really?

292
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:39,707
Hurry up. You're too slow.

293
00:20:40,828 --> 00:20:42,467
Don't be so hasty.

294
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:45,867
If you think we're slow,
you could buy a mahjong machine.

295
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:50,147
Right, from now on, we'll come every day
for the mahjong machine.

296
00:20:52,508 --> 00:20:54,588
I have an online event tonight.

297
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:55,667
I'll escort you back home first.

298
00:20:59,028 --> 00:21:00,548
Let me get changed first.

299
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:02,227
Okay.

300
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:09,427
Then I'll go outside first.

301
00:21:12,548 --> 00:21:13,308
Hurry up.

302
00:21:14,748 --> 00:21:15,748
What's the use of this tile?

303
00:21:15,748 --> 00:21:16,748
Two of Circles.

304
00:21:16,748 --> 00:21:17,296
Fa Cai.

305
00:21:18,467 --> 00:21:21,867
Fa Cai? It broke your kong.
It's your turn now.

306
00:21:21,867 --> 00:21:25,867
- Sheng, coming? We just started.
- Do you want to play?

307
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,147
- Come.
- Join us.

308
00:21:27,147 --> 00:21:28,187
No, thank you.

309
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:29,947
I'm fine just watching you play.
I have juice here.

310
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:33,040
Thank you.

311
00:21:38,508 --> 00:21:40,147
This place is pretty close
to the hospital.

312
00:21:41,907 --> 00:21:44,187
That's exactly why
I chose this neighborhood.

313
00:21:45,588 --> 00:21:48,467
It's roughly the same principle
my grandfather used.

314
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:52,432
He bought his house because it was
within walking distance to the hospital.

315
00:21:53,947 --> 00:21:56,627
Being a doctor means
you have to be on call at any time.

316
00:21:57,947 --> 00:21:59,627
Ever since I found out
you were a doctor,

317
00:21:59,627 --> 00:22:02,028
I've come to understand
why you can't be online often.

318
00:22:04,028 --> 00:22:07,024
It was actually okay before,
but I got busier since graduate school.

319
00:22:08,108 --> 00:22:08,907
And even busier later.

320
00:22:11,068 --> 00:22:12,947
I'll take the bus back myself.

321
00:22:12,947 --> 00:22:14,548
Now is the rush hour
for getting off work.

322
00:22:14,548 --> 00:22:17,748
If you drive me, you might get stuck
in traffic and be late for your event.

323
00:22:19,348 --> 00:22:22,627
Then let's take the subway.
I won't get stuck in traffic or be late.

324
00:22:26,548 --> 00:22:30,227
(The train to Sanlinli
will soon arrive at the station.)

325
00:22:30,227 --> 00:22:32,988
(Please stand behind the safety line
while waiting.)

326
00:22:32,988 --> 00:22:35,828
(Sound and Soulmates)
(Please don't lean on or hold the door.)

327
00:22:35,828 --> 00:22:37,648
(Online judge: Qiang Qingci)
(Please mind your steps.)

328
00:22:44,468 --> 00:22:46,032
(Sound and Soulmates)

329
00:22:47,268 --> 00:22:49,748
When will your event start?

330
00:22:49,748 --> 00:22:50,268
It's 8:30 p.m.

331
00:22:52,988 --> 00:22:59,068
That's seven stops.
It takes about an hour for a round trip.

332
00:22:59,068 --> 00:23:01,667
Don't worry. I've calculated the time.
It won't delay the work.

333
00:23:04,627 --> 00:23:05,387
I need to take a call.

334
00:23:05,387 --> 00:23:09,068
Hurry up! I have to go back
and watch the online event.

335
00:23:09,068 --> 00:23:10,707
It's not too late.

336
00:23:10,707 --> 00:23:11,147
Hello?

337
00:23:11,147 --> 00:23:13,147
Tonight's judges are all big shots.

338
00:23:14,544 --> 00:23:15,068
Yes.

339
00:23:15,068 --> 00:23:15,748
I can't miss it.

340
00:23:16,988 --> 00:23:18,748
It's a voice-acting contest?

341
00:23:18,748 --> 00:23:21,988
Yes, and the judges invited tonight
are all famous dubbing actors.

342
00:23:21,988 --> 00:23:22,508
This year...

343
00:23:22,508 --> 00:23:25,548
You've surely heard many of their voices
but can't match them to the person.

344
00:23:25,548 --> 00:23:28,508
If I want to continue my studies,
it'll be next year. I'm busy this year.

345
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:29,627
I'm exhausted.

346
00:23:32,068 --> 00:23:35,627
All right, I gotta go.
The subway train is coming.

347
00:23:35,627 --> 00:23:38,544
(Sound and Soulmates)

348
00:23:41,147 --> 00:23:41,988
Give me the backpack.

349
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:42,907
Okay.

350
00:23:42,907 --> 00:23:43,947
It's crowded.

351
00:23:43,947 --> 00:23:44,528
Let's go.

352
00:23:49,707 --> 00:23:51,907
Excuse us. Thank you.

353
00:23:52,907 --> 00:23:56,947
(The next stop
is the People's Hospital Station.)

354
00:23:56,947 --> 00:24:01,068
(Passengers going to
the People's Hospital, please be ready.)

355
00:24:01,068 --> 00:24:04,187
(Please get off at the doors

00:24:04,187 --> 00:24:08,788
(Please mind the gap between the train
and the platform when you get off.)

357
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:17,988
Were they talking about the event
you're going to tonight?

358
00:24:17,988 --> 00:24:18,672
Yes.

359
00:24:20,427 --> 00:24:23,867
The industry has improved lately,
and more people know about it.

360
00:24:23,867 --> 00:24:26,467
In the past,
not many people know about it.

361
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:32,748
Yeah, most of the discussions
were online in the past.

362
00:24:39,947 --> 00:24:44,508
When was the first time
you heard my voice?

363
00:24:47,828 --> 00:24:51,627
The second year
after the release of your first work.

364
00:24:54,907 --> 00:24:56,028
That's a pretty long time ago.

365
00:24:58,627 --> 00:25:02,788
Back then, I was only a few years
into the industry. Where were you then?

366
00:25:02,788 --> 00:25:04,348
I was in junior high school.

367
00:25:06,907 --> 00:25:08,068
We knew each other pretty early.

368
00:25:12,788 --> 00:25:13,867
Excuse me.

369
00:25:33,947 --> 00:25:36,867
Are you sure
you're not going to be late?

370
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:40,988
I don't joke about work.

371
00:25:54,268 --> 00:25:56,147
(Why doesn't Geng Xiaoxing contact me?)

372
00:25:58,068 --> 00:25:59,707
(Did I say something wrong?)

373
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:15,627
Cutting fruit is simple.
What's with all that noise?

374
00:26:15,627 --> 00:26:16,988
There's not even a fork.

375
00:26:16,988 --> 00:26:19,427
Are we going to eat or not?

376
00:26:19,427 --> 00:26:22,748
Why not?
If you two don't eat, I'll have it all.

377
00:26:25,187 --> 00:26:26,028
Your knife work is good.

378
00:26:29,867 --> 00:26:31,427
It's all yours. Eat up.

379
00:26:31,427 --> 00:26:32,588
What is he doing?

380
00:26:32,588 --> 00:26:34,028
What's wrong with him?

381
00:26:34,028 --> 00:26:34,588
I have no idea.

382
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:47,792
Eat.

383
00:26:50,187 --> 00:26:51,707
You took a fork?

384
00:26:51,707 --> 00:26:52,788
You are so attentive today.

385
00:26:55,068 --> 00:26:56,348
Have a try.

386
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:57,348
No problem at all.

387
00:27:01,467 --> 00:27:02,108
It's so sweet.

388
00:27:03,387 --> 00:27:03,907

390
00:27:26,108 --> 00:27:27,308
You ask him.

391
00:27:27,308 --> 00:27:29,867
- Why don't you ask?
- Doudou, you ask.

(It's okay.)

394
00:27:50,187 --> 00:27:52,272
What are you looking at? Just eat.

395
00:27:53,947 --> 00:27:55,268
I'll cut some more for you later.

396
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,028
This is really odd.

397
00:28:03,427 --> 00:28:05,907
Is he under too much pressure

398
00:28:05,907 --> 00:28:08,304
because he has been single for too long
and can't find a date?

399
00:28:09,348 --> 00:28:11,707
You'll never figure out
what an older man is thinking.

401

(My phone broke the other day.
I just got a new one.)

402
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:28,667
(Let's meet up.)

403
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:45,387
(Why?)

404
00:28:48,867 --> 00:28:50,187
Maybe I shouldn't send this?

405
00:28:54,548 --> 00:28:57,108
(They accidentally
dirtied the contract yesterday.)

406
00:28:57,108 --> 00:28:58,308
(We need to sign a new one.)

407
00:29:05,068 --> 00:29:06,467
(Can't you mail it?)

408
00:29:12,387 --> 00:29:15,508
(I'm passing by your school tomorrow.
How about we meet tomorrow morning?)

409
00:29:21,548 --> 00:29:24,508
(Alright then, let's say 10 a.m.
My class ends at that time.)

410
00:29:38,627 --> 00:29:39,508
What's so funny?

411
00:29:40,548 --> 00:29:41,108
What?

412
00:29:41,108 --> 00:29:42,147
Are you not going to the show?

413
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,068
It's still early.
There's plenty of time.

414
00:29:45,068 --> 00:29:47,588
There is not.
Quickly change your clothes.

415
00:29:47,588 --> 00:29:50,028
The organizer wants you to wear glasses.

416
00:29:50,028 --> 00:29:51,627
Why? Why glasses?

417
00:29:51,627 --> 00:29:54,788
They said you look more handsome
in glasses.

418
00:29:57,748 --> 00:29:58,548
Okay, got it.

419
00:29:58,548 --> 00:29:59,387
Don't be late.

420
00:29:59,387 --> 00:30:00,176
Okay.

421
00:30:01,627 --> 00:30:03,147
Glasses or not, I'm always handsome.

422
00:30:09,548 --> 00:30:10,068
Be careful.

423
00:30:12,028 --> 00:30:13,268
So many people at this stop.

424
00:30:13,268 --> 00:30:15,588
It's a transfer station.
Of course there are a lot of people.

425
00:30:15,588 --> 00:30:16,467
Hold on tight.

426
00:30:17,907 --> 00:30:20,467
Do you want
to move a little further closer?

427
00:30:31,988 --> 00:30:33,387
There are two more stops.

428
00:30:39,108 --> 00:30:41,588
When we arrive, you can directly go up
after you get off the train.

429
00:30:41,588 --> 00:30:43,748
It's a five-minute walk
from Gate No. 2 to your school.

430
00:30:47,268 --> 00:30:51,120
If a stranger tries to talk to you
on the way, just ignore them.

431
00:30:53,588 --> 00:30:54,707
I'm not a child.

432
00:30:57,867 --> 00:30:59,548
Then I won't walk you upstairs in a bit.

433
00:30:59,548 --> 00:31:01,328
I must take the subway
on the other side right away.

434
00:31:04,548 --> 00:31:06,947
Next time, I'll definitely walk you
to your dorm building.

Maybe I should walk you up.

Exiting the station
will require an extra fare.

I mean, officially start.
Did he confess to you?

472
00:33:30,947 --> 00:33:34,947
At first, it was because he would chew
on straws and the ends of his pens.

473

He would even chew
on the mouth of bottled drinks.

If it were the same for everyone,

480
00:33:52,788 --> 00:33:54,867
wouldn't they all like the same person?

00:36:30,948 --> 00:36:32,548
Does he have a girlfriend?

534
00:36:32,548 --> 00:36:34,588
How would I know?

535
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,068
(Zhou Zheng)

536
00:36:38,068 --> 00:36:39,627
He has quite a good image.

537
00:36:42,196 --> 00:36:42,928
(WeChat Moqingcheng)

538
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:48,267
Quite a few people are watching today.

539
00:36:48,267 --> 00:36:48,848
(I've arrived.)

540
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,456
(Sheng: Okay.)

541
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,776
(It's okay.)

542
00:36:59,028 --> 00:37:01,747
Nowadays, dubbing actors really
get more and more attention.

543
00:37:01,747 --> 00:37:03,827
That's great. Back in our days...

544
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:07,388
Who are you two texting?

545
00:37:08,548 --> 00:37:09,347
- My dad.
- My mom.

546
00:37:11,707 --> 00:37:13,787
Was I telling my monologue?

547
00:37:13,787 --> 00:37:14,307
Look.

548
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:31,908
Mr. Qiang, are you ready?

549
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:34,747
Then we can start at any time.

550
00:37:43,468 --> 00:37:44,267
(It's about to start.)

551
00:37:44,267 --> 00:37:47,187
Look at the comments. Everyone's talking
about Qiang Qingci and Juemei.

552
00:37:48,692 --> 00:37:50,000
(Okay.)

553
00:37:52,988 --> 00:37:55,028
(Have fun. I'm getting prepared.)

554
00:37:58,347 --> 00:37:59,468
(Okay.)
Just as I thought,

555
00:37:59,468 --> 00:38:02,267
they're all fans
of the Perfect Voice Studio.

556
00:38:03,428 --> 00:38:08,468
Hello, all the viewers at the scene
and those watching the live broadcast.

557
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:14,428
This is the live broadcast
of the Sound and Soulmates Contest.

558
00:38:14,428 --> 00:38:17,468
Today is our first stop of the contest.

559
00:38:17,468 --> 00:38:20,868
(Sound and Soulmates)
On the big screens on both sides

560
00:38:20,868 --> 00:38:23,428
are the real-time comments
and interactions

561
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:25,908
(Sound and Soulmates Contest Live Room)
from online friends.

562
00:38:28,147 --> 00:38:30,267
They're all fans of our judges.

563
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,988
First,

564
00:38:31,988 --> 00:38:37,147
let me introduce our five judges
for tonight.

565
00:38:37,147 --> 00:38:38,028
(They are...)

566
00:38:38,028 --> 00:38:38,827
Just as I thought.

567
00:38:38,827 --> 00:38:39,627
(Miss Zhang Xiao'ou.)

568
00:38:39,627 --> 00:38:40,868
My idol won't show up.

569
00:38:40,868 --> 00:38:42,227
(Mr. Shen Ming.)

570
00:38:42,227 --> 00:38:43,747
(We look forward to your review)

571
00:38:43,747 --> 00:38:45,388
Hello, everyone. I'm Shen Ming.

572
00:38:45,388 --> 00:38:47,347
Mr. Zhou Zheng.

573
00:38:52,827 --> 00:38:55,548
Hello, everyone.
I'm Zhou Zheng, aka Juemei Shayi.

574
00:38:57,548 --> 00:38:58,227
He's so handsome.

575
00:38:58,227 --> 00:38:59,347
(Mr. Zhao Tianyi.)

576
00:38:59,988 --> 00:39:01,456
(Juemei, look at me!
Mr. Tianyi, I love you!)

577
00:39:03,187 --> 00:39:07,667
And Mr. Qiang Qingci,
whom you've all been looking forward to.

578
00:39:08,707 --> 00:39:10,187
Hello, everyone. I'm Qiang Qingci.

579
00:39:12,147 --> 00:39:14,028
My idol has appeared.

580
00:39:15,307 --> 00:39:17,508
His voice is too pleasant to the ear.

581
00:39:17,508 --> 00:39:19,428
I'm so envious of you, Sheng.

582
00:39:19,428 --> 00:39:22,347
Sheng, won't Qiang Qingci
be on stage tonight?

583
00:39:22,347 --> 00:39:24,068
No, he won't.

584
00:39:24,068 --> 00:39:27,307
Next, let's welcome
our first contestant of today.

585
00:39:27,307 --> 00:39:30,388
Du Qiufei.
Let's give her a warm welcome.

586
00:39:31,056 --> 00:39:32,176
(Sound and Soulmates)

587
00:39:36,347 --> 00:39:37,908
Hello, everyone. Hello, dear judges.

588
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:40,307
I'm contestant No. 1, Du Qiufei.

589
00:39:40,307 --> 00:39:41,988
The performance
I'm bringing for you today

590
00:39:41,988 --> 00:39:44,747
is an excerpt
from A Lifetime in Jiangnan.

591
00:39:44,747 --> 00:39:47,948
I'm so looking forward to it.
Now let's hand the stage over to her.

592
00:39:48,244 --> 00:39:51,024
(Sound and Soulmates)

593
00:39:54,068 --> 00:39:55,312
(When I planned to avenge you,)

594
00:39:56,548 --> 00:39:57,787
(I thought about this.)

595
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:03,536
(If Shen's army failed
and was finally annihilated,)

596
00:40:04,432 --> 00:40:05,948
(I'd definitely be caught.)

597
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:09,227
Sheng, someone's
mentioning your name. Look.

598
00:40:09,227 --> 00:40:10,028
Let me quit now.

599
00:40:10,028 --> 00:40:11,428
- No.
- Hang on.

600
00:40:11,428 --> 00:40:12,028
It's okay.

601
00:40:13,068 --> 00:40:15,347
Everyone thinks we're here
to watch the show. It's okay.

602
00:40:15,347 --> 00:40:16,627
Plus, quitting looks intentional.

603
00:40:16,627 --> 00:40:17,508
Exactly.

604
00:40:18,324 --> 00:40:19,508
(Two-way love)

605
00:40:19,508 --> 00:40:22,307
I also have a spare account. So...

606
00:40:22,307 --> 00:40:24,588
No. The ID of 'Shengshengman'
has already appeared.

607
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,388
If you exit now, it will be even worse.

608
00:40:26,388 --> 00:40:28,112
It's okay. Just stay put.

609
00:40:28,112 --> 00:40:30,028
- Stay calm and eat noodles.
- It's fine.

610
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:32,187
(Then I could get my revenge.)

611
00:40:32,187 --> 00:40:33,232
(I shouldn't have been born.)

612
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:35,548
My fate has been cursed.

613
00:40:37,147 --> 00:40:40,988
In Jiangnan, it was you who bound me.

614
00:40:42,388 --> 00:40:43,428
I survived

615
00:40:44,787 --> 00:40:48,468
because you were born that year.

616
00:40:52,227 --> 00:40:55,760
Thank you, Chen Shaojie,
for your wonderful performance.

617
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,707
First, we'll invite all the contestants

618
00:40:57,707 --> 00:41:01,028
who have just appeared
to come back on stage.

619
00:41:01,028 --> 00:41:04,068
Next, we will invite Qiang Qingci
to give comments online

620
00:41:04,068 --> 00:41:06,096
(for our first group of contestants.)

621
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,147
- Qiang Qingci is here.
- Nice.

622
00:41:07,147 --> 00:41:08,068
Welcome.

623
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:13,827
These are tonight's
first group of contestants.

624
00:41:13,827 --> 00:41:16,908
Some of the contestants
presented us with great voice-acting.

625
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:20,028
It was very powerful,
with good rendering of lines.

626
00:41:20,028 --> 00:41:21,648
(But why didn't they get high scores?)

627
00:41:22,707 --> 00:41:25,267
(Actually, the opinions of us judges
are the same.)

628
00:41:25,267 --> 00:41:27,108
(Your voices are all pretty good.)

629
00:41:27,108 --> 00:41:29,988
But your interpretation of the lines
was a bit too superficial.

630
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:34,868
Every character has their own feelings
and background of growth.

631
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:38,388
Even when they speak,
due to their own personality and stance,

632
00:41:38,388 --> 00:41:41,028
their mental activity
and purpose in speaking vary.

633
00:41:42,147 --> 00:41:44,147
(Of course, we might haven't given you)

634
00:41:44,147 --> 00:41:46,787
(all this background information
in detail.)

635
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:48,388
(But this is where you can improvise.)

636
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:50,667
Let me give you a small example.

637
00:41:51,827 --> 00:41:54,827
For a line for a character,

638
00:41:54,827 --> 00:41:56,707
I remember one contestant
interpreting it this way:

639
00:41:58,068 --> 00:42:01,147
"I shouldn't have been born.
My fate has been cursed."

640
00:42:02,227 --> 00:42:03,588
That's exactly the same.

641
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:05,068
It's exactly like that contestant's.

642
00:42:05,068 --> 00:42:08,468
No, to be precise,
although the timbre is a bit different,

643
00:42:08,468 --> 00:42:12,147
the tone, the pause, and the feeling
are all the same.

644
00:42:13,428 --> 00:42:15,108
"You were born that year."

645
00:42:20,468 --> 00:42:22,388
It does sound
very tragic and sad this way.

646
00:42:22,388 --> 00:42:25,388
But if the emotion is too exaggerated,

647
00:42:25,388 --> 00:42:29,068
if the actor is too eager
to affect the audience with their voice,

648
00:42:29,068 --> 00:42:33,068
it actually lacks the emotional impact
that can move the audience.

649
00:42:33,068 --> 00:42:36,147
What really moves people
is the character's own emotions.

650
00:42:36,147 --> 00:42:37,747
So trust me,

651
00:42:37,747 --> 00:42:40,707
a normal person
wouldn't speak like that.

652
00:42:41,707 --> 00:42:45,267
This line can be interpreted
in various ways.

653
00:42:46,428 --> 00:42:50,468
For example, you can show self-mockery
and self-loathing.

654
00:42:55,028 --> 00:42:56,108
I shouldn't have been born.

655
00:42:58,388 --> 00:42:59,948
(My fate has been cursed.)

656
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:07,108
In Jiangnan, it was you who bound me.

657
00:43:10,147 --> 00:43:11,108
(I survived)

658
00:43:13,827 --> 00:43:15,627
because you were born that year.

659
00:43:25,347 --> 00:43:28,827
(You can also choose to express
the guilt about the past)

660
00:43:30,267 --> 00:43:31,508
and the hope deep within.

661
00:43:38,787 --> 00:43:39,827
I shouldn't have been born.

662
00:43:42,147 --> 00:43:43,307
(My fate has been cursed.)

663
00:43:47,187 --> 00:43:50,187
In Jiangnan, it was you who bound me.

664
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:55,307
I survived

665
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,068
because you were born that year.
