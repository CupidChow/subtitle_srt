=Episode 31=

25
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:46,100
(I want to marry you, Sheng.)

26
00:02:12,404 --> 00:02:14,883
- I'm hungry.
- You are?

27
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:31,163
- What do you want to eat?
- Coconut rice.

28
00:02:33,844 --> 00:02:34,723
Since I met you,

29
00:02:40,043 --> 00:02:41,883
I've used up all the vacation days
I've saved for years.

30
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:50,923
Does that mean
our next trip will be years away?

31
00:02:54,163 --> 00:02:54,723
It's possible.

32
00:03:03,203 --> 00:03:08,004
However, sometimes I have meetings
all over the country.

33
00:03:09,883 --> 00:03:10,844
If you have the time,

34
00:03:12,643 --> 00:03:16,883
during breaks from meetings,
I can accompany you to snack streets,

35
00:03:18,483 --> 00:03:19,763
famous sites, and such.

36
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:33,923
I've gotten used
to seeing you every day,

37
00:03:35,524 --> 00:03:39,883
seeing you all day long,
and saying goodnight face-to-face.

38
00:04:45,963 --> 00:04:48,364
- What are you doing?
- It's too hot. I'm going back.

39
00:04:48,843 --> 00:04:53,843
- Too... Take me with you.
- You're such a tag-along.

40
00:04:55,283 --> 00:04:58,443
The parting is near, and the atmosphere
between them is killing me.

41
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,203
I can't stay here anymore.

42
00:05:18,724 --> 00:05:20,004
The weather today is good, isn't it?

43
00:05:22,244 --> 00:05:23,564
The breeze is quite comfortable too.

44
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:04,124
You are awake.

45
00:06:07,564 --> 00:06:08,283
Did you sleep well?

46
00:06:13,364 --> 00:06:14,684
There are less than 20 hours left.

47
00:06:15,963 --> 00:06:20,403
Let's find something to do.
Don't waste this rare holiday.

48
00:06:41,124 --> 00:06:45,604
- What are you doing here? Isn't it hot?
- She...

49
00:06:49,004 --> 00:06:52,684
The sunshine is nice. It'd be a waste
if we didn't come out to bask.

50
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:57,643
Also, there are fruits and water here.
It's nice that we play with our phones.

51
00:07:01,643 --> 00:07:04,564
(Actually, she has to go back,
but she doesn't want to part with you.)

52
00:07:05,004 --> 00:07:09,643
(She doesn't want to disturb you.
So she sits here to see more of you.)

53
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:14,004
We are going out to eat in a while.
Why not join us?

54
00:07:15,484 --> 00:07:19,604
- Are you sure? Aren't you on a date?
- It's okay. Let's go together.

55
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,843
What's with the reservedness?
Let's go. It's such a good opportunity.

56
00:07:23,763 --> 00:07:26,364
Yeah, the more, the merrier.
Let's go together.

57
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:32,484
If you don't mind,
I'll go back to the room to get my bag.

58
00:07:32,763 --> 00:07:34,203
- I'll go get a power bank.
- Okay.

59
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:41,124
She's your fan.
She wants to see more of you.

60
00:07:41,283 --> 00:07:44,124
- She's afraid she won't see you again.
- I guessed it.

61
00:07:45,124 --> 00:07:46,124
You could even guess this?

62
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:50,244
There must be a reason why you
suddenly invited them to eat with us.

63
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:51,843
It was easy to figure it out.

64
00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:05,484
What's wrong?

65
00:08:12,604 --> 00:08:16,403
Mr. Mo, how about we see
who can get to the platform first?

66
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:18,164
Sure.

67
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,684
- Dong Yiru, what are you doing?
- I just don't want you to win.

68
00:08:30,963 --> 00:08:34,324
I'll tell my aunt
to dock your pay when I get back.

69
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:37,084
- Then I'll accuse you of jobbery.
- They are quite interesting.

70
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:40,683
They're often like this.
I'm used to it. My brother is too.

71
00:08:42,444 --> 00:08:44,854
Why don't we take a break over there
and enjoy the view there?

72
00:08:44,854 --> 00:08:45,283
Okay.

73
00:08:47,163 --> 00:08:48,004
Ouch!

74
00:08:49,124 --> 00:08:50,643
- I'm going up.
- Let's go.

75
00:08:51,403 --> 00:08:53,244
You can't catch up.

76
00:08:59,844 --> 00:09:03,163
It's so beautiful. So pretty.

77
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:07,364
The weather is so good. It'd be nice
if it could be like this every day.

78
00:09:07,883 --> 00:09:09,403
Yeah, it'd be nice
if every day could be like this.

79
00:09:09,523 --> 00:09:11,883
If you do this every day,
it will be the end of me.

80
00:09:12,043 --> 00:09:16,084
I'm in a good mood today.
I'll let you off.

81
00:09:22,204 --> 00:09:25,643
Yiru, these are for you.

82
00:09:27,223 --> 00:09:28,176
(Qiang Qingci)

83
00:09:28,803 --> 00:09:29,763
For me?

84
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:36,688
(Autographs
of all the Perfect Voice members)

85
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,163
The autographs of all of you!

86
00:09:39,964 --> 00:09:42,043
Thank you very much for supporting us.

87
00:09:43,923 --> 00:09:46,523
- Well...
- Say thank you.

88
00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:52,244
Thank you, Mr. Mo. I couldn't get these
even after waiting in line last time.

89
00:09:52,563 --> 00:09:54,444
Could you express my gratitude

90
00:09:54,444 --> 00:09:56,803
to the other members who are not here?
I've liked you guys for a long time.

91
00:09:56,803 --> 00:09:58,964
Alright, no need to be polite with me.
We are friends now.

92
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:00,883
We will see each other again
in the future, right?

93
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:03,643
Wait.

94
00:10:04,883 --> 00:10:08,163
Alright, if you want to thank them,
you can tell them yourself.

95
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:09,444
Okay.

96
00:10:10,604 --> 00:10:13,403
- Alright.
- Sheng, you are amazing.

97
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:15,683
- Let me take a look.
- No.

98
00:10:16,084 --> 00:10:18,283
Stingy. So few?

99
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:23,084
Like I said,

100
00:10:24,084 --> 00:10:25,643
there is definitely no problem
with Mr. Mo's character.

101
00:10:26,844 --> 00:10:28,604
- He's really not bad.
- Right?

102
00:10:28,604 --> 00:10:32,763
But it's still early days.
There is a long way to go.

103
00:10:32,964 --> 00:10:35,124
Being confident in him today
doesn't mean forever.

104
00:10:36,484 --> 00:10:39,604
Mr. Mo is genuine gold.
He can definitely withstand any test.

105
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:40,803
It's starting again, huh?

106
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:44,763
- Oh, my goodness.
- Let me see.

107
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:46,124
- No.
- Just one.

108
00:10:46,124 --> 00:10:47,484
- No.
- This one.

109
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:50,444
Don't!

110
00:10:52,004 --> 00:10:54,324
- What's the matter?
- You are so annoying.

111
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,883
So precious?
Okay, I'll take them all then.

112
00:11:00,484 --> 00:11:01,124
Thank you.

113
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:07,803
Thank you all as well.

114
00:11:41,803 --> 00:11:43,043
I'll go get the luggage first.

115
00:12:09,484 --> 00:12:11,204
Then, I'm leaving.

116
00:12:14,523 --> 00:12:17,004
Call me when you get home.

117
00:12:18,043 --> 00:12:18,724
Okay.

118
00:12:32,364 --> 00:12:33,883
I don't want to let you go
all of a sudden.

119
00:12:36,563 --> 00:12:39,124
I just toughened up to say goodbye,
but now I've lost that feeling.

120
00:12:43,124 --> 00:12:47,004
Then, how about I accompany you upstairs
to meet your parents?

121
00:12:49,844 --> 00:12:50,964
They are all asleep.

122
00:12:53,244 --> 00:12:54,403
I was joking with you.

123
00:12:55,403 --> 00:12:56,444
You scared me.

124
00:13:12,004 --> 00:13:14,604
Well, I'm really leaving now.

125
00:13:19,923 --> 00:13:23,004
- Good night.
- Good night.

126
00:13:31,803 --> 00:13:33,643
- Bye.
- Bye.

127
00:13:49,084 --> 00:13:50,043
- Let's go.
- Okay.

128
00:13:50,244 --> 00:13:50,604
Go.

129
00:13:55,163 --> 00:13:56,244
Don't be reluctant.

130
00:15:03,324 --> 00:15:03,883
Still not sleeping?

131
00:15:06,163 --> 00:15:06,923
I slept enough.

132
00:15:14,683 --> 00:15:15,803
Did you?

133
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:17,803
Or are you bothered?

134
00:15:25,283 --> 00:15:29,364
The whole world knows you like her,
but you refuse to admit it.

135
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:39,043
I just fear that once it starts,

136
00:15:40,043 --> 00:15:42,683
we won't even be able to be friends
if we break up.

137
00:15:57,084 --> 00:15:59,763
You forced out my inner thoughts.
Aren't you going to comment?

138
00:16:01,604 --> 00:16:02,283
I have no opinion.

139
00:16:03,324 --> 00:16:03,964
I wish you good luck.

140
00:16:05,844 --> 00:16:07,084
I didn't say I was going to confess.

141
00:16:08,403 --> 00:16:09,124
It's a wish in advance.

142
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:13,643
What if I get rejected after confessing?

143
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:22,643
Show your sincerity

144
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:24,364
and keep up.

145
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:43,312
(Mo Qingcheng)

146
00:16:56,364 --> 00:16:56,883
Hello?

147
00:16:57,444 --> 00:16:59,763
I couldn't sleep well,
so I came straight to the hospital.

148
00:17:00,744 --> 00:17:01,683
Did you sleep well last night?

149
00:17:03,844 --> 00:17:04,644
I miss you.

150
00:17:08,283 --> 00:17:08,884
For how much?

151
00:17:15,164 --> 00:17:17,803
I miss you a lot.

152
00:17:23,123 --> 00:17:26,083
I'll go to the supermarket later
and see if they have coconuts.

153
00:17:26,563 --> 00:17:27,843
Don't you want to eat coconut rice?

154
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:32,404
I'll make it for you.

155
00:17:36,484 --> 00:17:38,644
Still sleepy? Go back to sleep.

156
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,444
- Go.
- Okay. Bye.

157
00:18:09,603 --> 00:18:11,484
- Mao.
- We are back!

158
00:18:12,323 --> 00:18:14,763
- You are back.
- We brought you some local specialties.

159
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:18,004
- Right.
- I'm glad you guys remembered me.

160
00:18:18,644 --> 00:18:21,363
It wasn't in vain that I worked overtime
every night to let you two run wild.

161
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,523
Isn't it because your wife
wouldn't let you go with us?

162
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,644
Nonsense. That's called respect.

163
00:18:27,803 --> 00:18:30,043
How could Mao leave his wife
alone at home during the holiday?

164
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:33,043
Alright. How was this trip?

165
00:18:35,363 --> 00:18:38,204
I heard that Shengshengman's brother
went too.

166
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:42,244
Don't mention it.
Her brother was like a hovering hawk,

167
00:18:42,323 --> 00:18:43,684
following her closely.

168
00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:47,644
If it were not for us holding him back,
Mo's vacation would have been in vain.

169
00:18:48,964 --> 00:18:50,603
Will her brother
talk nonsense when he goes back?

170
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:55,164
Shouldn't you have a little more faith
in our prominent figure?

171
00:18:55,763 --> 00:18:58,724
Or we would've soaked her brother
in water for three hours for nothing.

172
00:18:59,363 --> 00:19:00,964
- Right.
- His skin was all wrinkled.

173
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:04,043
- Soaked in water?
- It was a pool party.

174
00:19:04,523 --> 00:19:06,964
- It was fun.
- Good for you.

175
00:19:07,684 --> 00:19:10,204
Mao, do you know? During this vacation,

176
00:19:10,323 --> 00:19:13,563
the relationship between Mo and Sheng
has been gradually warming up.

177
00:19:14,244 --> 00:19:16,843
But the luckiest one
is actually someone else.

178
00:19:17,004 --> 00:19:19,323
By all accounts,
Zhou Zheng should also pick up the pace.

179
00:19:20,123 --> 00:19:23,964
He seems like a lady-killer.
But when it comes to a critical moment,

180
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,884
his cowardice makes me anxious.

181
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:28,283
- How did you know?
- Right, how did you know?

182
00:19:28,404 --> 00:19:29,484
How couldn't I know?

183
00:19:30,843 --> 00:19:34,043
You sit at home and know everything
that's happening in the world.

184
00:19:34,283 --> 00:19:36,123
- You are admirable.
- It's nothing.

185
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,244
- For me?
- Yes.

186
00:19:39,363 --> 00:19:43,244
- Thank you, then.
- Mao, I bought it.

187
00:19:45,244 --> 00:19:47,283
- Let's get to work.
- Okay.

188
00:19:47,323 --> 00:19:50,404
- Just warm it up, and you can eat.
- He knows. No need to remind him.

189
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,323
- Let's start working.
- I chose it.

190
00:20:00,803 --> 00:20:02,283
- Haven't I told you?
- Stop.

191
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:05,363
Just watch TV at home and rest well
during the weekends.

192
00:20:05,563 --> 00:20:08,484
Didn't we come here just to help you
with the housework? Third brother.

193
00:20:08,484 --> 00:20:09,484
- Brother...
- Third brother.

194
00:20:10,763 --> 00:20:12,204
- Yes?
- I told you to collect the laundry.

195
00:20:12,323 --> 00:20:16,763
- How could you let Sheng do that?
- I forgot. I am cooking fish.

196
00:20:16,763 --> 00:20:19,684
If you were busy, let me know.
Hurry up to check on that fish.

197
00:20:20,283 --> 00:20:21,724
- Alright.
- It's okay.

198
00:20:21,724 --> 00:20:22,843
Come on. Have a seat.

199
00:20:24,204 --> 00:20:25,404
I'll help you with that.

200
00:20:27,404 --> 00:20:31,563
S-Sheng, a-a buddy of mine
sent me a message saying

201
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,244
the hospital across from our store is on fire
and the firefighters have gone there.

202
00:20:34,244 --> 00:20:37,323
- It's on fire? What happened?
- I'll make a call. Gu Jia is there.

203
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:38,363
Right. Ask him now.

204
00:20:42,884 --> 00:20:46,123
- How is it?
- He's not answering. I'll try again.

205
00:20:56,684 --> 00:20:58,644
I will go take a look myself.
He's not answering the phone.

206
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:02,563
(Mo Qingcheng)

207
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:03,884
- Sheng, are you going out?
- Sorry,

208
00:21:03,884 --> 00:21:05,603
the number you have dialed
is powered off.

209
00:21:09,323 --> 00:21:11,724
Sorry, the number you have dialed...

210
00:21:28,603 --> 00:21:32,444
- Hello, Sheng, what's up?
- Xiaoxing, can you get in touch with Juemei?

211
00:21:32,843 --> 00:21:34,083
G-Get in touch with him?

212
00:21:36,123 --> 00:21:38,644
I-I might not be able to do that.

213
00:21:39,684 --> 00:21:43,204
- Is there something wrong?
- Mo's cell phone is switched off.

214
00:21:43,444 --> 00:21:45,164
I don't know what happened,
and I can't find him.

215
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,803
Now, I don't know whether I should
go to the hospital or his place.

216
00:21:47,884 --> 00:21:49,444
I want to ask Juemei
if he's home or not.

217
00:21:51,123 --> 00:21:56,484
Perhaps his phone will be turned on
in a while. Don't worry.

218
00:21:59,523 --> 00:22:02,803
What's wrong? Your voice sounds like
something has happened.

219
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:06,843
His hospital is on fire. I can't find him.
I'm really worried about him.

220
00:22:07,884 --> 00:22:12,083
I'm sure he's okay. Perhaps his phone
is just out of battery, right?

221
00:22:12,684 --> 00:22:13,924
How can you be sure?

222
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:24,204
It's just... I believe in my heart
that he's okay.

223
00:22:27,523 --> 00:22:29,484
Have you seen where Mo is?

224
00:22:32,724 --> 00:22:33,484
Geng Xiaoxing!

225
00:22:37,884 --> 00:22:43,404
I'll tell you the truth.
I'm at Juemei's place.

226
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:49,484
Come over. It seems Mr. Mo is sleeping.

227
00:22:51,724 --> 00:22:55,204
- Alright, I'm coming now. Bye.
- I actually haven't...

228
00:23:58,763 --> 00:24:00,043
Juemei woke me up.

229
00:24:01,043 --> 00:24:03,484
He said you were coming over. What's up?

230
00:24:09,404 --> 00:24:10,083
Did you miss me?

231
00:24:33,644 --> 00:24:35,164
Is your phone out of battery?

232
00:24:36,244 --> 00:24:36,884
Out of battery?

233
00:24:42,803 --> 00:24:43,884
Seems like it is out of battery.

234
00:25:11,563 --> 00:25:14,523
I really wish to see you every day
when I wake up.

235
00:25:20,684 --> 00:25:22,164
I worked overtime
until 2 a.m. last night.

236
00:25:24,404 --> 00:25:25,323
You just woke up?

237
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:32,724
I slept for less than two hours.

238
00:25:36,283 --> 00:25:37,644
I'm still sleepy.

239
00:25:44,283 --> 00:25:45,843
Can you sleep with me for a while?

240
00:26:00,323 --> 00:26:01,964
There are fresh coconuts in the fridge.

241
00:26:03,924 --> 00:26:05,644
I'll make you
some coconut rice in a bit.

242
00:26:08,603 --> 00:26:09,843
You bought them?

243
00:26:11,283 --> 00:26:13,603
Is that enough for four people?

244
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:17,884
It's not for four people.

245
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,004
Just you and me.

246
00:26:24,924 --> 00:26:28,283
Are Juemei and Xiaoxing
going out to eat?

247
00:26:32,603 --> 00:26:33,123
Sheng,

248
00:26:37,123 --> 00:26:42,004
do you want to see me every day?

249
00:26:44,204 --> 00:26:45,004
Yes, I do.

250
00:26:46,444 --> 00:26:49,283
But you are very busy.

251
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:51,763
I can understand that.

252
00:26:53,843 --> 00:26:56,964
My grandfather was also this busy
when he was young.

253
00:26:58,123 --> 00:26:59,283
He often tells me about that.

254
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:03,323
Do you

255
00:27:06,363 --> 00:27:07,843
want to be able to find me at any time?

256
00:27:10,283 --> 00:27:11,164
Of course, I do.

257
00:27:13,484 --> 00:27:14,603
Do you want

258
00:27:17,363 --> 00:27:19,204
to sleep in our bed, waiting for me

259
00:27:20,644 --> 00:27:22,484
to come back at dawn,
even when I'm not home at night

260
00:27:23,724 --> 00:27:24,964
because of work?

261
00:27:37,644 --> 00:27:38,644
Do you

262
00:27:43,123 --> 00:27:44,684
want to hear my voice every day

263
00:27:48,404 --> 00:27:49,164
and have me

264
00:27:52,244 --> 00:27:53,684
lull you to sleep,
no matter how late it is?

265
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:03,603
Yes, I do.

266
00:28:08,323 --> 00:28:08,924
I'm glad that you do.

267
00:28:14,924 --> 00:28:15,763
So,

268
00:28:19,204 --> 00:28:20,123
from now on,

269
00:28:22,684 --> 00:28:23,644
it's just you and me.

270
00:28:27,964 --> 00:28:29,803
I'll only cook for my wife.

271
00:28:50,123 --> 00:28:50,803
Are you shocked?

272
00:28:56,323 --> 00:28:57,323
We are on the bed now.

273
00:28:58,884 --> 00:29:02,083
How could you

274
00:29:03,964 --> 00:29:06,603
ask...

275
00:29:08,603 --> 00:29:09,244
Ask for what?

276
00:29:13,123 --> 00:29:14,523
Ask...

277
00:29:23,204 --> 00:29:24,004
Ask...

278
00:29:33,924 --> 00:29:35,763
- Ask...
- I ask you to marry me.

279
00:29:53,323 --> 00:29:56,164
I want to marry you, Sheng.

305

Explain what?
There's nothing to explain.

306
00:31:58,603 --> 00:31:59,843
What? Isn't there?

307
00:32:03,763 --> 00:32:09,404
Well. If you say there's something,
that's it, okay?

308

311
00:32:19,363 --> 00:32:21,323
Okay, don't stand here. Have a seat.

312
00:32:21,884 --> 00:32:24,803
What should we say later,
if Sheng finds out?

313
00:32:31,444 --> 00:32:32,684
Let me tell you a story.

314
00:32:35,803 --> 00:32:36,204
Okay.

315
00:32:40,164 --> 00:32:46,283
(A few years ago, one day
I was resting in the on-call room.)

316
00:32:58,603 --> 00:33:00,843
How many night shifts did you have
to make you so tired?

317
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:02,603
I don't remember clearly.

318
00:33:04,043 --> 00:33:06,884
- Eat something.
- Thank you.

319
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:19,484
It's delicious.

320
00:33:21,523 --> 00:33:24,444
Our club wants
to make an album this year.

321
00:33:24,763 --> 00:33:26,644
They asked me
to help select a dozen songs.

322
00:33:27,684 --> 00:33:29,484
- Could you listen to them for me?
- Okay.

323
00:33:34,924 --> 00:33:35,484
Here we go.

335
00:34:44,043 --> 00:34:45,243
Why doesn't this song have a name?

336
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,964
You also think it sounds good, right?

337
00:34:50,603 --> 00:34:54,444
The arrangement, composition,
and the vocal are all quite good.

338
00:34:56,404 --> 00:34:58,924
Who is the composer?
And who's the singer?

339
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:01,964
Too bad I can't find the composer.

340
00:35:06,444 --> 00:35:07,004
You can't?

341
00:35:08,364 --> 00:35:12,043
We heard this song
in the library of submitted songs.

342
00:35:12,203 --> 00:35:15,444
Many new composers
submit their music to us.

343
00:35:15,804 --> 00:35:19,083
We all thought this song
was particularly good after finding it.

344
00:35:19,643 --> 00:35:22,203
But it has no name
and no information about the composer.

345
00:35:22,603 --> 00:35:25,364
As you know,
I take copyright issues very seriously.

346
00:35:25,683 --> 00:35:28,203
If I can't find the composer,
I can't use it.

347
00:35:31,844 --> 00:35:35,484
How about you send this song to me,
and I'll try to find its composer?

348
00:35:51,924 --> 00:35:54,284
(Then I searched
a lot of music libraries.)

349
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:59,723
(Back then, a lot of the music libraries
had incomplete song information.)

350
00:36:01,603 --> 00:36:05,444
(I couldn't find that voice.)

351
00:36:14,523 --> 00:36:17,203
You're not going to tell me
it's the song I uploaded?

352
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:19,444
What do you think?

353
00:36:20,563 --> 00:36:25,123
I did record and upload a few demos.
I was a complete newbie at that time.

354
00:36:25,243 --> 00:36:27,924
I didn't even get an online ID.
I was just singing for fun.

355
00:36:29,203 --> 00:36:32,163
And I don't even remember
how many platforms I uploaded it to.

356
00:36:32,563 --> 00:36:36,723
There were hundreds of similar pieces
to download back then, all nameless.

357
00:36:37,043 --> 00:36:38,324
How did you know it was me?

358
00:36:39,844 --> 00:36:42,484
- I didn't.
- Then...

359
00:36:44,004 --> 00:36:47,884
I searched for a long time
and got no results, so I gave up.

360
00:36:50,523 --> 00:36:51,683
But I remember your voice.

361
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:53,643
It's very special.

362
00:36:55,664 --> 00:36:57,203
Even if years had passed
before I heard it again,

363
00:36:59,143 --> 00:37:00,004
I could still recognize it.

364
00:37:06,404 --> 00:37:11,723
(Feng Yasong and I would go to various
unfamiliar chat rooms to listen to people talk.)

365
00:37:13,284 --> 00:37:14,992
(Both of us are busy with work.)

366
00:37:14,992 --> 00:37:17,924
(Shengshengman)
(But a dubbing actor needs to experience life.)

367
00:37:17,924 --> 00:37:20,283
- (Listening to strangers' chat)
- That pepper pork belly chicken is superb.

368
00:37:20,283 --> 00:37:21,163
(is kind of a method.)

369
00:37:23,163 --> 00:37:27,364
We ordered a red and white pot.
The white part is fresh soup.

370
00:37:27,723 --> 00:37:29,964
The red part is blood and tofu
from Taiwan, China.

371
00:37:31,284 --> 00:37:34,928
(Shengshengman)
Do you know how great that soup

372
00:37:34,928 --> 00:37:37,123
- tastes?
- Sheng,

373
00:37:37,444 --> 00:37:40,123
are you tormenting yourself
or taking revenge on me?

374
00:37:41,444 --> 00:37:44,004
(Shengshengman)
To be honest, it's my first time knowing

375
00:37:44,243 --> 00:37:47,163
pork belly and chicken stewed together
are so tasty.

376
00:37:47,764 --> 00:37:50,884
Imagine brewing the soup
until it turns milky white.

377
00:37:51,123 --> 00:37:54,123
And it is filled with a rich taste
of herbs and the aroma of pepper.

378
00:37:55,924 --> 00:37:57,924
I swear, that one next to the hospital

379
00:37:58,004 --> 00:38:00,243
absolutely ranks in the top three
of pork belly chicken hotpots.

380
00:38:08,484 --> 00:38:09,603
Why aren't you speaking?

381
00:38:17,123 --> 00:38:18,723
This is a famous Hakka dish
from Guangdong.

382
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:21,444
If you have time,

383
00:38:22,844 --> 00:38:23,964
you can also make it at home.

384
00:38:24,048 --> 00:38:25,884
(Qiang Qingci)

385
00:38:25,884 --> 00:38:29,284
Actually, it's not hard to make it.
It just needs some time.

386
00:38:30,004 --> 00:38:32,884
And cleaning the pork belly
can be a bit troublesome.

387
00:38:33,683 --> 00:38:36,324
Try to have all the ingredients.
It will be very nourishing.

388
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:44,243
I remember there are red dates,
codonopsis, polygonatum, and goji berries.

389
00:38:45,643 --> 00:38:48,364
The rest
are some commonly used seasonings,

390
00:38:49,284 --> 00:38:50,563
such as salt and white peppercorns.

391
00:38:51,804 --> 00:38:52,364
Of course,

392
00:38:53,804 --> 00:38:57,723
- you also need cooking wine and ginger.
- Can you hear me talking?

393
00:38:58,043 --> 00:39:00,683
Put the chicken inside the pork belly
and seal the pork belly with toothpicks.

394
00:39:01,804 --> 00:39:02,643
Then simmer them.

395
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:07,324
I'm in a tunnel.
The signal is not very good.

396
00:39:09,884 --> 00:39:13,444
(Then one day. I was working overtime
and went to a supermarket to buy things.)

Then?

Then...

406
00:40:00,804 --> 00:40:04,364
- It's time to make coconut rice.
- Why don't you finish the story?

407
00:40:05,004 --> 00:40:06,603
Finish it first.

408
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:22,444
- Mr. Mo.
- You are here.

Sheng.

410
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:35,083
Zheng, didn't you say you were alone?

411
00:40:35,284 --> 00:40:38,444
This makes me feel very embarrassed.
I should have invited Feishao over too.

412
00:40:38,924 --> 00:40:41,284
- What's to be embarrassed about? Sit.
- Fine.

413
00:40:45,683 --> 00:40:46,203
Continue.

414
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:49,243
- Let me cook first.
- I want to hear it.

415
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:52,043
- Right, cook first. I'm hungry.
- See?

416
00:40:54,043 --> 00:40:55,804
You sit as well. Why are you standing?

417
00:40:59,643 --> 00:41:03,376
- Tell me the story.
- You two carry on.

418
00:41:03,376 --> 00:41:05,243
- I'll close the door for you.
- Thank you.

419
00:41:07,643 --> 00:41:08,203
Tell me.

420
00:41:09,844 --> 00:41:14,163
I wanted to make this for you only.
Now it looks like you'll have to share.

421
00:41:14,523 --> 00:41:16,884
I like eating with everyone else.
Just tell me the story.

422
00:41:18,163 --> 00:41:21,444
- Let me cook first.
- Can't you talk while cooking?

423
00:41:21,523 --> 00:41:24,123
Of course not.
I need to focus while cooking.

424
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:26,603
Do you like it a bit sweeter?

425
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,484
This is for you. It's a bit sweeter.

426
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:57,203
How long does it take to steam these?

427
00:41:58,804 --> 00:42:01,964
Over an hour. And they need to simmer
for another half an hour after that.

428
00:42:04,364 --> 00:42:06,964
Perfect. You can tell me the story now.
Go ahead, tell me.

429
00:42:11,203 --> 00:42:12,123
You know everything

430
00:42:14,804 --> 00:42:15,804
about what happened later.

431
00:42:19,444 --> 00:42:20,764
So we've known each other
for a long time.

432
00:42:24,384 --> 00:42:25,444
It's just that you were unaware.

433
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,324
Did you compose this song?

434
00:42:46,444 --> 00:42:47,284
Did you mention it to him?

435
00:42:48,284 --> 00:42:50,123
Yes, she saved a few on my computer.
I listen to them often.

436
00:42:50,924 --> 00:42:53,844
Because working at the hospital
is usually tiring and busy.

437
00:42:54,243 --> 00:42:57,964
Listening to her songs relaxes me a lot.
It's a very nice pastime.

438
00:42:58,324 --> 00:43:00,484
We got to know each other
due to the songs she wrote.

439
00:43:01,964 --> 00:43:04,324
I'm one of her unknown fans.

440
00:43:04,844 --> 00:43:07,484
You told many lies just now.

441
00:43:08,163 --> 00:43:10,444
You're not one of my fans.

442
00:43:11,643 --> 00:43:12,924
They could be too easily found out.

443
00:43:14,243 --> 00:43:16,123
Some are true and some are false.

444
00:43:19,404 --> 00:43:21,163
If you hadn't told me, I wouldn't...

445
00:43:30,004 --> 00:43:31,603
Even if you have said it now,

446
00:43:34,844 --> 00:43:35,804
I dare not fully believe it.

447
00:43:47,404 --> 00:43:48,163
I will not lie to you.

448
00:43:50,723 --> 00:43:54,004
