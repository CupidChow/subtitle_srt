I shouldn't have been born.

27
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:55,270
So, my life has always been hard.

28
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,150
In Jiangnan, it was you who bound me.

29
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:11,031
I survived because
you were born that year.

30
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,471
So charming.

31
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,790
Sheng, he's indeed your idol
you have been in love with for years.

32
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:23,191
Brilliant.

33
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,871
(Sound and Soulmates)
The comments are endless.

34

Look at that one.

Other flowers fade away once I bloom.

36

Exquisite.

37
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:34,271
Thank you, Mr. Qiang Qingci.

38
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,790
There is no specific background.

39
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,390
It's up to the contestants to interpret.

40
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,910
Whatever kind of interpretation
is not wrong.

41
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,151
The most important thing
is as long as you can touch us.

42
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:48,670
Okay, thank

43
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,031
Mr. Qiang Qingci
for his insightful comments.

44
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,191
They are helpful to the contestants.

45
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:55,950
Thank our first group of contestants
for your hard work.

46
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,790
Have a break backstage. Thank you.

47
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:05,031
Next up, we'll be welcoming
the second group of participants.

48
00:03:05,191 --> 00:03:07,510
Let's hand over the stage to them.

49
00:03:13,191 --> 00:03:14,711
The live broadcast is exhausting.

50
00:03:14,871 --> 00:03:16,191
We're getting tired just by watching.

51
00:03:16,311 --> 00:03:18,031
It must be more tiring
to record the show on-site.

52
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,510
You're feeling sorry for him?

53
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,311
I mean everyone onsite.

54
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,390
But he is a doctor.

55
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:29,431
He often works
for 36 or 48 hours straight.

56
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:31,390
This should be a piece of cake for him.

57
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:34,431
Qiang Qingci is a doctor?

58
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,431
Did she tell you about it?

59
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:38,991
No.

60
00:03:41,991 --> 00:03:45,151
Well, we have only met a few times.
I haven't had the chance to tell you.

61
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:47,311
Gu Sheng, you've changed.

62
00:03:47,431 --> 00:03:49,991
Geng Xiaoxing, we never
hide anything from you.

63
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:53,311
I even told you the details of
how my partner kissed me.

64
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,790
How could you not
share with us your dating process?

65
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,390
Right?

66
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,230
Yes. Tell us the truth.

67
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,230
- The host is coming. Hurry. Look.
- Come here.

68
00:04:09,991 --> 00:04:12,431
So, that brings us
to the end of tonight's competition.

69
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:14,751
We also want to say a big thank you
to all of the judges on site,

70
00:04:14,871 --> 00:04:17,191
the audiences and all the staff

71
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:20,070
for being with our contestants tonight.

72
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,751
After our live broadcast ends,

73
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,950
there is a bonus waiting for you

74
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,871
in our online live room.

75
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,830
(A mysterious gift.)

76
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,791
There is a bonus.

77
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:31,830
(To be given out to you.)

78
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:33,871
Let's look at the big screen together.

79
00:04:35,751 --> 00:04:37,630
- Let's have a meal when you're free.
- Sure.

80
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:45,808
(Qiang Qingci)

81
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,470
Qiang Qingci.

82
00:04:55,911 --> 00:04:56,470
Feng Yasong.

83
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,911
Doudoubing

84
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,630
Wang Ke and Feishao.

85
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,710
All from the Perfect Voice Studio.

86
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,551
This is the Voice of Fleeting Years.

87
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,911
Voice of Fleeting Years Studio.

88
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,470
How many guests did they invite?

89
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:13,311
It is specifically for the competition.

90
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:14,991
Of course, because
they are based here and there.

91
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,431
Because of the Internet speed.

92
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:18,070
They will be coming online gradually.

93
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,311
Please be patient.

94
00:05:21,351 --> 00:05:23,030
It's not just the Perfect Voice Studio.

95
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:25,751
The oldest four top clubs are all here.

96
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:27,991
They definitely weren't
invited by the show.

97
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,470
It must have been Qiang Qingci
and Juemei who invited them.

98
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:34,111
In fact, I really envy those

99
00:05:34,111 --> 00:05:35,791
who made friends
when they were nobodies.

100
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:38,710
You bet.

101
00:05:39,751 --> 00:05:42,150
Don't disturb me
from enjoying the impressive lineup.

102
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,150
So many guests.

103
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,830
They are all slowly gathering.

104
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,751
Is there anyone you like in there?

105
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:48,911
- Yes.
- Yes.

106
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:49,751
Yes.

107
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:54,030
Tonight will definitely be
a night full of surprises and perks.

108
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:57,751
It could also be considered
a belated Valentine's Day gift.

109
00:05:57,751 --> 00:06:01,590
So, I will peacefully be
a little fan with you

110
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:04,590
and wait for their gifts.

111
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:10,150
Long time no see, everyone.

112
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,390
I'm on my way to the airport.

113
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,431
The signal might not be great in a bit.

114
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,431
Please forgive me.

115
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,431
It's okay.

116
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,070
Because among us old friends,

117
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:24,111
I'm the only one who is an online host.

118
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:25,671
So, I will be the host

119
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:27,510
for this midnight session today.

120
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,390
Today, other than
one or two who couldn't make it,

121
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,231
almost everyone is here.

122
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,030
Right, Mr. Qiang Qingci?

123
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,991
The whole world likes to tease him.

124
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,311
It must be because today is
the day after Valentine's Day,

125
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:44,150
Mr. Qiang must have been busy yesterday.

126
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:46,231
What were you doing?

127
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,791
What were you doing?

128
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,390
Me?

129
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,351
I was doing what I should do.

130
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,871
What he should do.

131
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,911
Tell us honestly where you have been.

132
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:09,911
Let's watch the live first.

133
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,390
Alright.

134
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,231
Tonight's opening song
for the midnight show is a medley.

135
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:15,671
How?

136
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,351
The most beautiful
four beauties of tonight

137
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,950
will bring you an explosive opening
that ignites the stage.

138

Please let me paint your face

00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:04,551
As is initially.

213
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:07,311
As is originally.

214
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,950
All friends on the scene and online,

215
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:20,551
all the bonus sessions ended.

216
00:12:20,631 --> 00:12:23,191
Once again, thank you all
for your participation.

217
00:12:23,311 --> 00:12:24,590
Thank you everyone.

219
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:52,631
(Are you busy?)

220
00:13:06,271 --> 00:13:08,791
(Yeah, some things.)

221
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:11,710
(Go ahead.)

222
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,350
(Play by yourself for a while.)

223
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,750
(I'll call you when I finish.)

224
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:23,590
(Okay.)

227
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,031
(I wrap up, but it's too late.)

228
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,230
(I won't call you then. Good night.)

229
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,911
(Or, good morning.)

230
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:14,950
Missing a boy?

231
00:14:16,551 --> 00:14:18,551
No. "Missing him."

232
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:20,271
Go away.

233
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,151
Working the night shift again.

234
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:32,870
I came temporarily.

235
00:14:33,391 --> 00:14:34,990
How is the patient in bed nineteen?

236
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:36,191
Pretty good.

237
00:14:36,311 --> 00:14:38,511
He's being discharged and waiting for
his family to pick him up.

238
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,110
Is he your friend's family?

239
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,870
My friend's grandpa.

240
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,311
Zhao.

241
00:14:49,911 --> 00:14:51,110
Discuss something with you.

242
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,230
May I leave the hospital on my own?

243
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,870
It's a weekday.

244
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,311
It's not appropriate for the kids
to take time off to get me.

245
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:01,870
That won't do.

246
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:04,870
You're a doctor yourself.
You should understand.

247
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:06,590
If your family doesn't come,

248
00:15:06,671 --> 00:15:07,990
and given your age,

249
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,631
how could we possibly let you go?

250
00:15:10,151 --> 00:15:11,511
Alright. I'll listen to you.

251
00:15:27,631 --> 00:15:28,151
Morning.

252
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,230
Hi, Doudou.

253
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:35,950
You alone? Where are they?

254
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,431
Mr. Mo is taking a nap inside.

255
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,990
I'm really worried.

256
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:50,311
He finally got a girlfriend.

257
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,110
He has surgeries today, then tomorrow.

258
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:53,470
Overnight shift the day after tomorrow

259
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,671
and then the hospital
calls him back again.

260
00:15:56,191 --> 00:15:59,551
Eventually, the girlfriend will be gone.

261
00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:02,990
What do you have?

262
00:16:06,511 --> 00:16:07,631
I'll pass. I'm leaving.

263
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,671
Where are you going?

264
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,311
I, well, have to go to the company.

265
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,870
I bought a lot today. Have some.

266
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,511
I'll pass. This is enough for me.

267
00:16:15,511 --> 00:16:16,311
Take a cup of soy milk.

268
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:26,791
I-I have to attend PE class.

269
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,631
Where is the contract?
Give it to me and I'll sign it.

270
00:16:30,431 --> 00:16:31,830
Where's your PE class? Is it far?

271
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:33,990
Yes. It takes ten minutes to get there.

272
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,350
I'll sign the contract.

273
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,990
How about I give you a ride?

274
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,110
Stop it. Let's go. Get in the car.

275
00:16:41,191 --> 00:16:42,391
Aren't you running out of time? Go.

276
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,990
T-Thank you.

277
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:45,590
Let's go.

278
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:46,470
Thank you.

279
00:16:50,671 --> 00:16:51,631
(What happened?)

280
00:16:52,031 --> 00:16:54,151
(Someone drives you
to attend even PE class.)

281
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,110
Buckle your seatbelt, will you?

282
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,271
Need a hand?

283
00:17:00,391 --> 00:17:01,911
No, thanks. I am good.

284
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:07,310
- Just tell me how to get there.
- Alright.

285
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,071
I caught up. Thank you so much.

286
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,831
- I'll be leaving.
- All right.

287
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,431
The contract.

288
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,750
I'll sign it for you after class.

289
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:06,431
Help me press it down again.

290
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,230
(Why do you sit PE exams
in your senior year?)

291
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,591
(It's an exceptional case.)

292
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:42,111
Geng Xiaoxing.

293
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:44,030
I'm here.

294
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:46,631
- I'm going over there.
- Okay.

295
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:48,911
Came for the exam?

296
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:50,671
You've done that paper.

297
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,191
Just finish these two tests.

298
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,871
Thank you, Sir.

299
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,191
Go. Start with the ball.

300
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,671
(What to eat tonight?)

301
00:19:25,391 --> 00:19:26,671
(I still have a class today.)

302
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:27,911
(I can't go home until tonight.)

303
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,710
Really?

304
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:40,790
What are you doing here?

305
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,550
I took a rest today.

306
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,431
Came to accompany you for class.

307
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,950
Have a meal, then go home.

308
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,230
How did you know I attend this class?

309
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,470
I got your schedule.

310
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,151
The teacher.

311
00:20:03,431 --> 00:20:05,710
(Luckily, it's an optional course
and no one knows each other.)

312
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,710
Students, wait a moment.

313
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,550
I'm going to upload the materials.

314
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,790
(Pretend.)

315
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,391
(It's an optional course.
It doesn't matter.)

316
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,510
Today, we will appreciate
a gunfight action movie.

317
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,911
While watching,

318
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:33,871
pay attention

319
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:36,151
to the coordination between
the rhythm of the music and the screen.

320
00:20:36,831 --> 00:20:37,431
Wait a moment.

321
00:20:37,431 --> 00:20:38,064
(Black and White)

322
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,638
(Qiang Qingci dubbed Cheng Quanyun,
March 28, 2020)

323
00:20:42,831 --> 00:20:44,790
The movie we're going to appreciate

324
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:46,310
is a gunfight action movie.

325
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:48,790
While watching,

326
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,671
notice the rhythm.

327
00:20:49,671 --> 00:20:53,191
Could you help me
with the curtain later?

328
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,550
Sure.

329
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,191
Congratulations on your graduation.

330
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:22,911
Amazing.

331
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,351
Thank you, Sir. Thank you.

332
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,191
You are the best.

333
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,871
Go ahead. Your boyfriend
has been waiting for a long time.

334
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:34,750
No, no. He's not my boyfriend.

335
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,790
H-He is just a friend, Sir.

336
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,790
Go ahead. You've finished the exam.

337
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:40,510
Thank you, Sir.

338
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,391
- Goodbye, Sir.
- Bye-bye.

339
00:21:43,431 --> 00:21:45,191
Goodbye. I passed. Goodbye.

340
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:45,710
Goodbye.

341
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,871
Next student.

342
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,671
In the blue shirt, come on.

343
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,871
Have a rest here.

344
00:21:58,391 --> 00:21:59,151
The exam is over.

345
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,111
Finally, it is over.

346
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:02,911
Thank you.

347
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:05,111
Thanks for driving me here.

348
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,790
Otherwise, I would have failed.

349
00:22:07,671 --> 00:22:08,831
Finally finished the exam.

350
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,950
Why did you need to take PE exams
even in your senior year?

351
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,111
I went on an exchange
during my sophomore and junior year.

352
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,391
I didn't get a chance to take it.

353
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:20,871
So it had to be moved to now.

354
00:22:30,111 --> 00:22:30,631
Thank you.

355
00:22:43,351 --> 00:22:45,111
Is there any place I didn't clean?

356
00:22:48,391 --> 00:22:49,750
Here. A little bit.

357
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,510
Let me sign the contract.

358
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,871
The contract is in the car.

359
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,831
Have a rest. We can get it later.

360
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,790
Cool. After I rest,

361
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,310
- I'll go with you.
- Okay.

362
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,911
If I knew you were taking PE,

363
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,111
I would have bought you a bubble tea.

364
00:23:19,911 --> 00:23:21,510
I'm okay. I'm not thirsty.

365
00:23:26,151 --> 00:23:27,391
I'd better go buy one.

366
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,790
I mean I have already finished the exam.

367
00:23:36,431 --> 00:23:37,710
I'll go with you and get it.

368
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:41,230
Okay. Let's go then.

369
00:23:42,831 --> 00:23:43,470
Alright.

370
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,351
Tired, huh?

371
00:23:54,631 --> 00:23:55,310
A little.

372
00:24:28,631 --> 00:24:31,911
Isn't this course
Western Classical Music History?

373
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,431
Lights off?

374
00:24:34,351 --> 00:24:37,831
The teacher changed it last minute
to Film and TV Masterpiece Appreciation.

375
00:24:38,831 --> 00:24:41,431
- Coincidence. We can watch the movie.
- That sounds good.

376
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,071
Sir, I can't see clearly.
May I change my seat?

377
00:24:46,191 --> 00:24:46,871
Yes.

378
00:24:47,591 --> 00:24:49,151
The students who need to change seats.

379
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,950
Please do it now,
so you won't have to get up later.

380
00:24:59,270 --> 00:24:59,911
Excuse me.

381
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:02,671
Thank you.

382
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:03,710
You're welcome.

383
00:25:07,871 --> 00:25:10,470
Can we eat snacks, Sir?

384
00:25:10,591 --> 00:25:11,990
How about get you some popcorn?

385
00:25:12,351 --> 00:25:14,191
I think I should prepare well
for you next time.

386
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,750
For those who want to date,

387
00:25:16,351 --> 00:25:17,990
you can do it after class,

388
00:25:18,431 --> 00:25:21,230
but when it comes to watching movies,
we need to stay serious.

389
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:26,950
Why are they all looking at me?

390
00:25:59,831 --> 00:26:02,790
Mr. Mo was called back
to the hospital again?

391
00:26:04,111 --> 00:26:05,871
I think he went to find Sheng.

392
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,351
What a steel will.

393
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:17,351
He's already handsome and yet still
pursues love with a fighting spirit.

394
00:26:20,431 --> 00:26:21,351
Where's Juemei?

395
00:26:21,911 --> 00:26:23,550
He said he went to sign a contract.

396
00:26:23,671 --> 00:26:25,270
It should be a company matter.

397
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:29,990
He's so rich now. Can't he take a break?

398
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,351
Are you busy these days?

399
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,631
Not really. Chill.

400
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,871
I've completed all the credit hours.
I'm just waiting to graduate.

401
00:26:52,071 --> 00:26:54,230
I took the optional class today

402
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,111
because there are not many
serious classes this semester.

403
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:57,790
Randomly.

404
00:26:58,591 --> 00:27:00,270
That course is actually fun.

405
00:27:00,431 --> 00:27:02,550
He makes each class
sound like a stand-up comedy.

406
00:27:05,831 --> 00:27:07,071
I thought you were really busy.

407
00:27:08,871 --> 00:27:09,950
Why?

408
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:15,631
When I checked my phone after work,
I didn't find any messages from you.

409
00:27:16,831 --> 00:27:20,151
I didn't know what to send.

410
00:27:21,671 --> 00:27:23,710
I thought we could chat at any time.

411
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:30,111
Before.

412
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,310
Now there's nothing to chat about?

413
00:27:36,431 --> 00:27:39,950
What are you doing here today?

414
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,151
What else could I be doing here?

415
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,191
I mean, besides finding me,

416
00:27:46,191 --> 00:27:48,030
is there anything else you need to do?

417
00:27:48,631 --> 00:27:51,310
Do I need to do anything else
besides finding you?

418
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,631
(Canteen 3)
Did you bring me to eat at the canteen?

419
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,550
No. I didn't think too much
and came over here.

420
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,431
Let me treat you at the canteen.

421
00:28:03,671 --> 00:28:05,631
Our school has a Xinjiang restaurant.

422
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,990
- Their saute spicy chicken is yummy.
- Sounds good.

423
00:28:09,391 --> 00:28:10,270
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

424
00:28:16,191 --> 00:28:17,550
The saute spicy chicken is sold out.

425
00:28:19,591 --> 00:28:21,591
It's alright. We can eat this.

426
00:28:22,431 --> 00:28:23,671
Come earlier next time.

427
00:28:24,191 --> 00:28:24,750
Sure.

428
00:28:28,071 --> 00:28:29,310
You like saute spicy chicken?

429
00:28:31,191 --> 00:28:32,071
I could make it for you.

430
00:28:32,351 --> 00:28:33,270
Great.

431
00:28:33,391 --> 00:28:34,831
You can even cook saute spicy chicken.

432
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,270
Yes, I can.

433
00:28:39,431 --> 00:28:41,030
Why do you like cooking?

434
00:28:43,111 --> 00:28:44,391
When I was a kid, my parents were busy.

435
00:28:44,591 --> 00:28:47,270
I had nothing to do at home,
so I started learning to cook.

436
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,911
Then I cooked better and better.

437
00:28:50,591 --> 00:28:52,591
They began taking the meals
I prepared to the hospital.

438
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:56,470
Later, I often cooked for them.

439
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,750
Such a dutiful person.

440
00:28:59,911 --> 00:29:00,710
Dutiful?

441
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,750
No. It's gifted.

442
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,351
My parents were busy when I was young.

443
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,831
So, I lived with my grandfather.

444
00:29:10,071 --> 00:29:11,671
I wanted to learn to cook myself.

445
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:13,990
However,

446
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:18,790
my cooking has an indescribable taste.

447
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,230
I kind of want to give it a try.

448
00:29:29,591 --> 00:29:33,030
What plans do you have after dinner?

449
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:37,071
- None.
- Me neither.

450
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:43,191
- Let's find something to do later.
- Okay.

451
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:53,591
What did you do on your dates?

452
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,310
I have never dated.

453
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:06,871
Really?

454
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,550
Yeah.

455
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:12,431
- What about you?
- The same.

456
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,790
Like you, I have never dated.

457
00:30:20,911 --> 00:30:22,111
Why are you laughing?

458
00:30:22,591 --> 00:30:26,111
Isn't it normal for me
given I am younger than you?

459
00:30:27,071 --> 00:30:27,671
Indeed.

460
00:30:43,871 --> 00:30:44,671
No worries.

461
00:30:45,631 --> 00:30:47,911
I can make saute spicy chicken
anytime you feel like eating it.

462
00:30:48,391 --> 00:30:51,111
- The taste won't be worse than here.
- Okay.

463
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,671
- What's wrong?
- I forgot it.

464
00:30:58,871 --> 00:31:00,631
I have to clean the studio today.

465
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,631
The studio?

466
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:05,431
We rented a place in an old community

467
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,310
and renovated it into
a recording studio.

468
00:31:08,071 --> 00:31:10,470
Of course, it can't be compared
with your Tianzi No. 1 Recording Studio.

469
00:31:10,631 --> 00:31:11,310
We just started it.

470
00:31:11,431 --> 00:31:13,750
Today is my turn to clean.

471
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,631
They always go on time.

472
00:31:18,591 --> 00:31:20,750
How about I drop you
at the subway station

473
00:31:20,871 --> 00:31:22,111
before I go clean it?

474
00:31:22,911 --> 00:31:23,510
I'll go with you.

475
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,750
It isn't suitable.

476
00:31:26,911 --> 00:31:28,591
You came all this way to be with me

477
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,470
and I'm having you watch me clean.

478
00:31:30,591 --> 00:31:31,831
I came to meet you today.

479
00:31:32,431 --> 00:31:34,230
Anything else doesn't matter.

480
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,071
- Let's go. Take me with you.
- Let's go.

481
00:31:45,591 --> 00:31:46,270
Here is it.

482
00:31:47,151 --> 00:31:48,631
The colored glass part
on the second floor.

483
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,431
- The environment here is good.
- Yes.

484
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,111
There is another gate up front.

485
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,151
It's a very long downhill
and extremely beautiful.

486
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,671
- Let's take that way next time.
- Sure.

487
00:32:01,431 --> 00:32:03,550
Look, this is my studio.

488
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,526
(Zhaozhaomumu Music Studio)

489
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,710
Over here is our collection of work.

490
00:32:10,831 --> 00:32:12,191
(Works Display Panel)
Though not many...

491
00:32:17,391 --> 00:32:19,351
Our place, though not as large as yours,

492
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,470
is still small and cozy enough.

493
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,431
Gu Sheng, you're so loud.

494
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,351
You woke me up
before I got enough sleep.

495
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,631
My head is hurting.

496
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:36,351
Should I talk?

497
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:39,671
This sofa is so hard.
It gives me backaches.

498
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,950
You can say whatever you want.

499
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:43,710
But try not to sound like you...

500
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,351
Specifically, don't sound
like Qiang Qingci.

501
00:32:58,631 --> 00:33:00,631
Why are you sleeping here?

502
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,550
I forgot my keys.

503
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,111
Then why didn't you turn on the AC?
In case catch a cold.

504
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,550
Save energy. Who's he?

505
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:16,790
He is my friend.

506
00:33:18,391 --> 00:33:19,151
A good friend.

507
00:33:22,151 --> 00:33:22,631
Hello.

508
00:33:25,391 --> 00:33:26,591
Have we met before?

509
00:33:29,351 --> 00:33:32,470
Probably not.

510
00:33:37,111 --> 00:33:39,750
Then why does your voice
sound so familiar?

511
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,871
Familiar? It's just a common voice.

512
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,710
I'll go brush my teeth now.

513
00:33:56,431 --> 00:33:58,591
It's fine. He's nice.

514
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,470
Come over here. Sit.

515
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,391
Stop chatting, Sheng.

516
00:34:00,911 --> 00:34:01,831
Clean up now.

517
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:03,270
Wait a moment.

518
00:34:03,391 --> 00:34:04,750
It'll just take an hour.

519
00:34:11,471 --> 00:34:12,830
- Wait a moment.
- What?

520
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,870
Isn't Qiang Qingci pursuing you?

521
00:34:15,591 --> 00:34:16,750
What's going on with you?

522
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:19,710
You mustn't covet more
after obtaining something.

523
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:21,750
It's not like that.

524
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,031
What do you mean?

525
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:24,910
Look at the way
you two are glancing at each other,

526
00:34:25,031 --> 00:34:26,511
so romantically ambiguous.

527
00:34:28,551 --> 00:34:31,551
Listen, my idol is a good person.

528
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,551
I don't know
if he has any issues in terms of looks.

529
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,551
But his character is impeccable.

530
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,951
After all, he is Qiang Qingci,
the dream and ideal of many.

531
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,511
I know.

532
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:44,151
Even knowing that,
you still flirt with that guy?

533
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:52,910
He's a senior at the school next door.

534
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:57,031
The most dangerous word is "senior."

535
00:34:57,671 --> 00:34:58,951
You've never been a senior?

536
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,151
I would never covet a junior sister.

537
00:35:02,031 --> 00:35:04,111
Fine. I won't talk with you.
I'll go clean up.

538
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,830
I'll do it. I'll do it.

539
00:35:13,991 --> 00:35:15,951
What's the point of inviting you over
if you have to work?

540
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,350
It's okay.

541
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:19,230
I have nothing to do
when sitting here. Move around.

542
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,230
(How is my idol any inferior to him?)

543
00:36:00,111 --> 00:36:00,790
You are here.

544
00:36:07,191 --> 00:36:08,471
Why did you all come?

545
00:36:09,071 --> 00:36:10,511
Off Key said he had no money for food.

546
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:11,951
We came to deliver food.

547
00:36:15,991 --> 00:36:17,471
Who is this?

548
00:36:21,071 --> 00:36:23,151
Off Key, your friend?

549
00:36:25,991 --> 00:36:27,111
My friend.

550
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,191
Yes. It is her friend.

551
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,430
He's a senior
from her neighboring school.

552
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,111
- Hello.
- Hello.

553
00:36:37,591 --> 00:36:39,870
How can we
ask a guest to clean up in our studio?

554
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:41,031
Come on. Let's all help.

555
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,511
It's fine. No worries.

556
00:36:43,111 --> 00:36:45,151
Sheng, go keep your friend company.

557
00:36:45,191 --> 00:36:45,951
- Don't bother.
- Go.

558
00:36:47,031 --> 00:36:49,270
No. Stay still, everybody.

559
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:51,151
It's my turn today.

560
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:53,031
It was supposed to be
my cleaning day anyway.

561
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:54,511
Silly girl.

562
00:36:54,591 --> 00:36:56,031
You're the only one following the rules.

563
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,191
Off Key even had me
clean for him last week.

564
00:36:58,511 --> 00:37:00,230
Can you finish what you're saying?

565
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,991
Why don't you mention
I treated you to a meal?

566
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,390
Fold it yourself.

567
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,111
Or, how about this?

568
00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:06,710
I'll treat you to a meal.

569
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:08,270
Don't bother.

570
00:37:09,071 --> 00:37:10,551
We could eat at your school's cafeteria.

571
00:37:10,631 --> 00:37:12,230
- We'll use your card.
- Sure.

572
00:37:12,551 --> 00:37:14,151
I've been wanting to try
the saute spicy chicken.

573
00:37:15,071 --> 00:37:17,071
It is usually sold out by noon.

574
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,471
Sold out again?

575
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,671
I'll make it.

576
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,310
It's too much trouble.

577
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,591
Let's just order takeout.

578
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,511
Takeout won't taste
as good as what I make.

579
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,151
Gu Sheng has had it.

580
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,750
She knows. You can ask her.

581
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:41,270
Tastes really good indeed.

582
00:37:42,071 --> 00:37:44,270
Off Key, go with him to buy groceries.

583
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,310
We'll clean up.

584
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,350
Let's go then, neighbor senior.

585
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,790
I'll wait for you outside.

586
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:52,870
Alright.

587
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:54,390
I'm heading out.

588
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,790
- Give me.
- Okay.

589
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,310
Please be careful.

590
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,471
Who's him? He's chasing you?

591
00:38:04,591 --> 00:38:05,471
Looks pretty good.

592
00:38:05,471 --> 00:38:06,151
Quite serious.

593
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:07,591
He's diligent, not delicate.

594
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,591
He can also cook.

595
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,071
How do you feel about it?

596
00:38:10,191 --> 00:38:11,151
Want a relationship?

597
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,390
What about Qiang Qingci?

598
00:38:20,151 --> 00:38:22,031
Dude, you seem to have ulterior motives.

599
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,111
You see it through?

600
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:25,870
Nonsense.

601
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,471
I am a man too.

602
00:38:27,591 --> 00:38:29,631
I see through your little schemes.

603
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,750
How long have you been chasing her?

604
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:35,270
A long time.

605
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:37,230
But it's useless.

606
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:40,551
To tell you the truth,
there are many people chasing her.

607
00:38:41,671 --> 00:38:42,230
Really?

608
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,471
I guess I need to try harder then.

609
00:38:44,471 --> 00:38:45,511
It may be futile.

610
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,071
She has a suitor who is quite famous.

611
00:38:48,471 --> 00:38:50,270
He's a famous dubbing actor.

612
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,471
He has millions of fans.

613
00:38:52,151 --> 00:38:53,910
He's always dropping hints on his Weibo.

614
00:38:53,991 --> 00:38:55,270
His pursuit is quite high-profile.

615
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,551
What do you do? Do you have a job?

616
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:00,551
I am a doctor.

617
00:39:01,591 --> 00:39:02,310
A doctor.

618
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:05,111
Grandma, where are you going?

619
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,350
I'm almost home around the corner.

620
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,151
Let me help you.

621
00:39:08,151 --> 00:39:08,830
It's fine.

622
00:39:09,991 --> 00:39:11,390
Young man, you are kind.

623
00:39:12,191 --> 00:39:13,071
You're welcome, grandma.

624
00:39:15,031 --> 00:39:16,031
This is my home.

625
00:39:16,031 --> 00:39:16,750
This one, right?

626
00:39:17,031 --> 00:39:18,111
Yes. This one.

627
00:39:19,671 --> 00:39:22,830
(A doctor is a good job indeed.)

628
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:25,111
(He looks good,
does housework and can cook.)

629
00:39:25,111 --> 00:39:25,830
Take care, grandma.

630
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,671
(Even if I am
a diehard fan of Qiang Qingci,)

631
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:29,830
(I am also a buddy of Sheng's.)

632
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,710
- It's fine. There you up.
- Okay.

633
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,350
(If I have to choose,
Sheng is more important.)

634
00:39:34,631 --> 00:39:35,671
- Bye, grandma.
- Thank you.

635
00:39:35,671 --> 00:39:37,591
- (Forget it. Let's see who she likes.)
- You're welcome.

636
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,390
You came all the way to see me.

637
00:39:52,591 --> 00:39:54,151
You've been cleaning and cooking too.

638
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,310
I'm quite embarrassed.

639
00:39:56,591 --> 00:39:58,790
Didn't I promise to make
saute spicy chicken for you at noon?

640
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,591
Since everyone wants to eat it,

641
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,471
isn't it just right?

642
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,790
They have always been very good to me.

643
00:40:04,991 --> 00:40:06,870
We are a nobody club,

644
00:40:06,991 --> 00:40:08,471
but we get along well.

645
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:09,951
I can tell.

646
00:40:11,111 --> 00:40:14,430
Actually, Off Key and Guai
don't earn much.

647
00:40:14,671 --> 00:40:15,750
Especially Off Key.

648
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:19,111
He can't afford to rent a house.

649
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:20,910
He lives in the company's dormitory.

650
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:22,511
Occasionally, he would
come to live here.

651
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:25,071
It's because
one of his roommates got married.

652
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:26,511
Once his wife comes,

653
00:40:26,631 --> 00:40:29,310
he would willingly give up
space for their family gathering.

654
00:40:32,551 --> 00:40:35,270
We used to be a small club too.

655
00:40:35,631 --> 00:40:38,270
At first, everyone
pooled money to rent a house.

656
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,591
Then, we got more and more dubbing work.

657
00:40:41,671 --> 00:40:42,591
So things improved.

658
00:40:43,471 --> 00:40:45,750
Later on, everyone started working.

659
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,671
When we had salaries,
things got even better.

660
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:51,910
May not be enough.

661
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:52,591
Add a little more.

662
00:40:53,191 --> 00:40:55,151
I have hinted enough at you

663
00:40:55,151 --> 00:40:55,991
to learn cooking.

664
00:40:56,471 --> 00:40:58,230
We bought so many
kitchen utensils and seasonings.

665
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,111
The first time cooking happens
when guests come over.

666
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,151
Is that appropriate?

667
00:41:01,631 --> 00:41:02,310
Did you hear that?

668
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,710
My cooking skills are not good.

669
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:06,270
Even if I cook,
you don't like to eat it.

670
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,551
I think he's not bad.

671
00:41:09,111 --> 00:41:09,750
I think so too.

672
00:41:11,151 --> 00:41:12,350
Yes.

673
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:14,031
But I always feel something is off.

674
00:41:14,511 --> 00:41:16,551
The other day,
I saw my idol, Qiang Qingci,

675
00:41:16,671 --> 00:41:17,710
posted a new song on Weibo.

676
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,310
- It's said they went to an exhibit.
- Really?

677
00:41:22,551 --> 00:41:23,230
But...

678
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:26,551
Sheng and Qiang Qingci
haven't met many times.

679
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:29,191
I don't think sparks flew between them.

680
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,320
They must have made it clear.

681
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,071
Makes sense.

682
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,511
Sheng is not someone who will two-time.

683
00:41:36,551 --> 00:41:38,031
It must be because
they don't have chemistry.

684
00:41:38,511 --> 00:41:41,151
That's why we have the senior
who can cook saute spicy chicken.

685
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:44,111
No. I just knew

686
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,991
they had known each other for long.

687
00:41:49,191 --> 00:41:52,951
- Rice wine.
- Rice wine. Here you go.

688
00:41:57,031 --> 00:41:57,551
Smells great.

689
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,071
So good.

690
00:42:00,511 --> 00:42:03,031
Learn from this skill.

691
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:07,991
I'm a bit behind
in preparing the things below.

692
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:09,071
Could you all help me?

693
00:42:09,191 --> 00:42:09,910
- I'm in.
- Okay.

694
00:42:10,151 --> 00:42:11,790
I always help my mom at home.

695
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:12,591
I can do it, too.

696
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:13,710
What dishes are there?

697
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,191
There are cumin lamb

698
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,151
and belt noodles.

699
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,310
I've also prepared some kebobs.

700
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:19,870
Once they're done, I will take them out.

701
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:21,951
We haven't decided on the vegetables.

702
00:42:23,191 --> 00:42:24,671
How about spicy and sour cabbage?

703
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,230
- Impressive.
- Here.

704
00:42:32,991 --> 00:42:35,790
The last main dish, the belt noodles.

705
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,631
My favorite.

706
00:42:37,631 --> 00:42:38,151
While it's hot.

707
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:38,671
I want it.

708
00:42:38,671 --> 00:42:40,191
- Eat up.
- Let me have a taste. I'm starving.

709
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,631
How is it? Is it delicious?

710
00:42:45,151 --> 00:42:47,350
It is much better
than the ones made outside.

711
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,031
Really?

712
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:50,071
- If it's good, eat more.
- Right.

713
00:42:50,511 --> 00:42:51,551
Try this quickly. Try this.

714
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,790
- Delicious.
- The chicken isn't dry at all.

715
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,951
Why don't you come over
every week, senior next door?

716
00:42:59,951 --> 00:43:01,071
I'll do the grocery shopping.

717
00:43:01,471 --> 00:43:04,031
Senior, I will cover
all of Sheng's duty days.

718
00:43:04,151 --> 00:43:06,991
As long as you come once a week.

719
00:43:07,511 --> 00:43:08,430
I'd like to.

720
00:43:08,551 --> 00:43:09,671
But I don't usually have time.

721
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:10,671
It's rare for today.

722
00:43:12,111 --> 00:43:13,710
- Sheng.
- Sheng.

723
00:43:17,991 --> 00:43:19,910
He did not lie to you.

724
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:21,270
He is really busy.

725
00:43:21,951 --> 00:43:23,671
Then I have to eat a few more bites.

726
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:25,870
Otherwise, I don't know
when I will eat next.

727
00:43:25,991 --> 00:43:27,031
Next time, hmm.

728
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:28,430
Let me think about it.

729
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:31,710
What about two weeks later?

730
00:43:32,111 --> 00:43:33,230
- Really?
- Really?

731
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,511
If I don't have to work overtime.

732
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:35,671
Deal.

733
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:36,350
I'll wait for you.

734
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:39,991
