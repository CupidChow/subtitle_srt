What do I do? I hope it's simple.

54

It's okay. Don't worry. You got this.

55
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,519
Just say something.

56
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,120

Yes, I do.

Love scenes are not
as complicated as you think.

66
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,919
You don't have to be experienced.

67
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,600
The key is to make the audience

68
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,600
feel the sincerity in your lines.

69
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,640
Dig deep. Know yourselves.

70
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,799
Keep practicing. That's it.

71
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:17,359
Amazing. That was awesome.

72
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,760
It sounded real.

73
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,359
He's a professional dubbing actor.

74
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:25,919
Of course, he sounds real.

75
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,679
He's said that line many times.

76
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,999
I'll show you next time.

77
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,040
I really admire his acting partners.

78
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,720
How did they handle the confession?

79
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,080
Didn't they fall in love with him?

80
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,200
No idea.

81
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,919
Isn't there any gossip about him?

82
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,160
He never dated anyone from work?

83
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,960
No idea.

84
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,280
You know better. Think harder.

85
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,520
I think there were some rumors.

86
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,280
That was nice. It sounded even better

87
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,176
than in those shows.

88
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,960
Do you hear the booming sound

89
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,119

90
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,760
How many times
have you said "I love you" in shows?

91
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,960
I don't remember,
but surely not as many as you.

92
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,280
Dig deep. Keep practicing.

93
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:22,520

94
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,160

103

I got some for her too.

104
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,999
You know what?

105
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:08,679
Qiang Qingci said "I love you" to her.

106
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:09,840
Really? When?

107
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,960
Really.

108
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,239
It was a line from the rehearsal.

109
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,840
You scared me.

110
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,960

someone says that to you.

111

112
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,960
Yeah, why can't I get so lucky?

113

He hasn't worked with someone for years.

114
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,520
Sheng, you were lucky.

115
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,439
He was the first guy who confessed to you.
You were so lucky.

116
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:32,400

Let's go.

131
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,520
Oh, you mentioned the gossip

132
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,239
about Qiang Qingci yesterday.

133
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,160
Is there someone

134
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,080
widely seen as his official couple?

135
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,840
- No.
- No.

136
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,496
Why not? Nobody brought it up?

137
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,839
He introduced himself briefly

138
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,240
when he first joined the studio.

139
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,160

- (I'm single.)

- (I'll inform you once I get a girlfriend.)

142
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:53,240
So serious.
No one dared to make fun of him.

143
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,000
And his fans are the toughest.

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,280
Better not offend them.

145
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,064
Yeah.

146
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:00,160
So scary?

147
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,280
Dig in. We have tests later.

148
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,719
Yeah, right.

149
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,120

150

classes, and class numbers first.

155
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,799
Stay quiet during the test.

156
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,799
No conversing.

157
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,360

174
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:42,799
Which app?

175

The one with Shengshengman?

176
00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:56,120
I spoke to them.

177

178

179

What are we having tonight?

187
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,520
I'll book a place for a barbecue?

188
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,319
Alright.

189
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,640
I have so many parcels to get.

190
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,552
Let me get them.

191
00:11:33,552 --> 00:11:34,599
Need a hand?

192
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:35,480
No, thanks.

193
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,959
Let me check on my Weibo.

194
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,400
You still remember that?

195
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,728
Your 200 fans, do you still have them?

At least, none of them is a robot.

197
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,280
I've known many of them.

198
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,199
They've been following me for two years.

199
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:56,839
Our club leader told me
to verify my account after the tests.

200
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:58,959
It's more formal. I'll need your help.

201
00:11:58,959 --> 00:11:59,679
I'm new to this.

202
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,599
Why do I have so many new fans?

203
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,679

00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:21,480
Not really.

Qiang Qingci is following you, Sheng.

210
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,120
Why is he following you?

211
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,520
No idea. What happened?

212
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,120
What happened indeed?

213
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,360
He told you "I love you".

214
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,032
Stop making fun of me or I'll lose it.

You can't be a dubbing actress.

216
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,704
You blush too easily.

217
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,559
Examine your posts
for anything inappropriate.

218
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,439
Let's leave a good impression.

219
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,439
There's nothing.

220
00:12:58,439 --> 00:12:59,480
Just some complaints.

221
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,199
I post mainly about what to eat

(ID verification, Requirements)
Click on the page for verification.

229
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,719
It needs verification from my friends?

230
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:27,360
Yeah, get some verified members
to verify for you.

231

I don't have many friends like that.

232

from the system.

to follow you.

00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,839
It's medium spicy and easy to make.

370
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:50,280
It's just hard to clean the clams.

371
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:58,399
Soak them in salt water for 30 minutes

372
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:01,799
to make the clams spit out the sand
and clean them well.

373
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,760
Put them in boiled water
so that they open up.

374
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,879
(I hope I can record this for his fans.)

375
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:10,480
Prepare two seasonings,
one with soy sauce,

376
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,200
sugar, cooking wine,
white pepper, and broth.

377
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,799
Mix them well.

378
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:19,399
Add some oil to the frying pan.

379
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:22,240
Fry the fermented soya beans
and smashed garlic.

380
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,720
Cook the stem of scallion,
red peppers, and shredded ginger.

381
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,879
Add the clams and sauce
and cook on high fire.

382
00:21:29,879 --> 00:21:31,639
Once half the water evaporates,

383
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:33,799
pour in starch water and keep stirring.

384
00:21:34,832 --> 00:21:38,359
In the end,
add the green leaves of the scallion.

385
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:45,712
Got it?

386
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,920
Got it. Thanks.

387
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,000
I have to go.
When will you sing for me again?

388
00:21:56,112 --> 00:21:57,440
Again?

389
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,559
This is the only time?

390
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,359
Tell me whenever you're free.

391
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,000
Okay.

392
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:09,960
Bye.

393
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,680
Bye.

394
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,000
What is she doing?

395
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,480
Have you booked the restaurant?

396
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,559
Yeah.

397
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,480
Where are you with Qiang Qingci now?

398
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,240
You're secretly meeting
in his chat room?

399
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,079
Aren't you scared of his fans?

400
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:53,119
You met in his private chat room?

401
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:55,639
I just sang a song for him.

402
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:57,720
You sang a song for him
in his private chat room?

403
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,520
Yeah, it looks like that.

404
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,599
But it's not like that.

405
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:06,040
Get up. Get changed.

406
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,440
We finished the tests.
The barbecue matters the most.

407
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,240
Sheng, when did you become so close?

408
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,960
There's nothing between us.

409
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,839
I forgot a parcel. Let me get it. Bye.

410
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:19,639
Sheng.

411
00:23:33,639 --> 00:23:35,480
Dr. Mo became Chef Mo?

412
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,640
I downed my food with those "clams".

413
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,359
You're welcome.

414
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,879
Mo Qingcheng, the chef slash doctor.

415
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:45,799
Aren't you busy?

416
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,824
I'm swamped.
The Spring Festival is coming.

417
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,879
Oh, got any plans for the festival?

418
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:53,319
Stay and work. What else?

419
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:00,280
Condolence from another single guy.

420
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,240
Zheng, it's for me?

421
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,319
No, I'm checking on this unmarried man.

422
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:10,559
Alright, go ahead.

423
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:10,960
Alright.

424
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,399
I'll do rounds.

425
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:12,440
Okay.

426
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,680
Why are you here?

427
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,928
Aren't you flying soon?

428
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,040
You look miserable alone.
So I brought you some supplies.

429
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,960
Thanks.

430
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,000
Don't mention it.

431
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,240
You always work at the hospital

432
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,512
or the studio
during the Spring Festival.

433
00:24:31,568 --> 00:24:33,240
It's quite sad to think about it.

434
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:37,200
Isn't that nice? It's fulfilling.

435
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,119
Stop kidding me.

436
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,879
Should I book you a ticket?

437
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:43,399
Celebrate the Spring Festival with me.

438
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,472
All my nephews and nieces
are old enough to run around. It's fun.

439
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,599
And it's snowing in the Northeast.
It's gorgeous.

440
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:54,359
I can't leave. Besides, I'm used to it.

441
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,792
It's nice to be alone.

442
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,048
Think of it as a vacation
for the Spring Festival.

443
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:03,119
Fine, I know I can't change your mind.

444
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:05,879
Doudou got you food at the studio.

445
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,839
Cook for yourself
on the Lunar New Year's Eve.

446
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,319
We'll keep you company online.

447
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,319
Okay.

448
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:13,359
I'm heading to the airport now.

449
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,159
Okay, safe trip. See you around.

450
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,680
Take care.

451
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,599
Send my regards.

452
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,280
Bye.

453
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:22,839
Take care.

454
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:23,408
Okay.

455
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,000
Playing chess?

456
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,639
Yeah.

457
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,159
Keep it straight, boss.

458
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:30,119
(Fortune)
Rest assured.

459
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:35,960
Uncle, you have a red envelope for me?

460
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,720
Kiddo, it's too early for that.
Get back to work.

461
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,599
Tell Auntie to make some fish.

462
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:41,440
Alright.

463
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,079
What's for dinner, Uncle?

464
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,639
(Fortune)
Let me show you.

465
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:46,159
Hurry up.

466
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,000
Coming, Grandpa.

467
00:25:49,008 --> 00:25:49,520
Wait.

468
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,040
Here?

469
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,399
No, it should be on the left.

470
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:54,480
You're so illiterate.

471
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,879
Oh, fine. Let me see.

472
00:25:55,879 --> 00:25:56,639
Is it okay?

473
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:58,800
Yeah. Good. The horizontal scroll.

474
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,399
Okay.

475
00:25:59,399 --> 00:25:59,960
Here.

476
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,879
(Star of Fortune shines upon us)
Alright. Press it.

477
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,520
- Okay.
- Good.

478
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,480
Spring Festival.

479
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,359
Star of Fortune shines upon us.
It brings us fortune and happiness.

480
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:28,200
I wish you a happy Lunar New Year's Eve
from the North.

481
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,848
Happy New Year.

482
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,680
Happy New Year to you too.

483
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:38,288
Sheng, let's close down early today.

484
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,960
Stop playing on the phone.
Get the flowers in.

485
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,799
Why don't you do it?

486
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:45,799
I'm busy. Come on. Hurry up.

487
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:49,944
(Wangjia Supermarket)

488
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,079
It's a hospital. Do your job!

489
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:55,639
Easy.

490
00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:57,639
Our kid waited
for the doctor till midnight.

491
00:26:57,639 --> 00:27:00,839
Sir, listen to me. You got us wrong.

492
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:02,680
No more excuses.
"There are too many kids"?

493
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,119
My kid was sick too.

494
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,319
Again?

495
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:09,960
They're bothering the doctors.

496
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,440
Looks like it.

497
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,680
It happens all the time.

498
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,119
They'll learn to behave
when nobody wants to be a doctor.

499
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:17,399
Too many kids are getting sick.

500
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:20,000
You think I won't hit you
because you're a woman?

501
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,839
Get your supervisor here!

502
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:22,960
Do you hear me?

503
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,079
Please calm down. We can explain.

504
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,760
Please don't fight.

505
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,799
Please don't fight.

506
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,879
Who are you? None of your business.

507
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,040
What's wrong? You scared me.

508
00:27:34,064 --> 00:27:34,640
Security!

509
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,359
Are you okay?

510
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,119
Geez.

511
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:38,639
Let me help you.

512
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:42,040
Bring me that small box from the back.

513
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,119
(Wangjia Supermarket)
Please calm down.

514
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:44,720
Are you okay?

515
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,399
Are you okay?

516
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,200
I'm fine. Take them in. Are you okay?

517
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,776
We're fine.

518
00:27:49,776 --> 00:27:50,960
Let's go.

519
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,148
We deserve an explanation.

520
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:52,848
(For ambulance only)

521
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:55,920
Put it here.

522
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,608
(First People's Hospital)

523
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:09,168
What are you looking at? You know them?

524
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,319
I saw the doctor
who came for the yogurt.

525
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:17,200
And you read his fortune.

526
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:21,040
Yeah, he's quite a decent man.

527
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,399
He protected the girls.

528
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:26,559
I'll give him a discount next time.

529
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,280
Yeah, you'll cover the shortage.

530
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,839
Is Dr. Mo back?

531
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:48,799
He's in there. Just a second.

532
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,119
Someone was looking for trouble.

533
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:53,359
He tried to help and got hit.

534
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,079
We're already overwhelmed
during the Spring Festival.

535
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:57,040
And this on top of that?

536
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,960
You found an ice pack?
I thought I'd bring you one.

537
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,680
Guess I'm too late.

538
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,928
- Dr. Mo.
- Dr. Mo.

539
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,360
It's okay. Sit.

540
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,480
Okay.

541
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,879
They came to say thank you.

542
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,839
Sorry about that.

543
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:18,200
It's okay. What did they want?

544
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,960
Too many kids
are having fevers these days.

545
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,639
Several kids came
at the same time last night.

546
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:26,839
She got overwhelmed.

547
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:28,920
Those parents accused her of being slow

548
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,200
and came to look for trouble today.

549
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:35,359
Dr. Mo, are you okay?

550
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,359
I'm okay.

551
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,240
Do something. They're worried.

552
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,079
Right.

553
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,079
It's fine now.

554
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,920
Dr. Mo, thank you so much.

555
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,920
Thank you.

556
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,040
Don't mention it.

557
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,920
Don't rush to leave. Have some water.

558
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,448
Rest a bit.

559
00:29:58,448 --> 00:29:59,559
Okay, thanks.

560
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:01,359
I have things to do.

561
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:02,240
Okay.

562
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,760
Zhang Lele, come with me.

563
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,639
What?

564
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,599
Should I sit there

565
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:12,480
and listen to them saying thank you?

566
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,200
What's wrong with that?

567
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,879
We're late for dinner.

568
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:19,408
The supermarket sells packed meals.

569
00:30:19,408 --> 00:30:21,760
They taste good. My treat.

570
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,060
Let's go.

571
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,008
(Wangjia Supermarket)

572
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,720
Sheng, come and help me in the storage
once you post the notice.

573
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,319
Okay.

574
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,079
(Happy New Year)
What would you like?

575
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,559
Anything will do.

576
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:48,960
Why are the lights out?

577
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,159
Yeah, why is it dark?

578
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:52,350
(Wangjia Supermarket)
What's going on?

579
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:57,720
(10:00 to 18:00 during the festival)
What a shame.

580
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:02,960
Never mind. Let's go over there.

581
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,600
Let's go.

582
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,240
Let's go.

583
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,079
(Wangjia Supermarket)
Go. Let me lock up.

584
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,359
- Hello, Xiaoxing.
- Go online tonight.

585
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:19,440
The Perfect Voice
invites us to their event.

586
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,680
What should we do?

587
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,760
Should we prepare a show?

588
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,960
No need.
They want to discuss the pre-release.

589
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,960
You have to be there.

590
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,540
I'll celebrate with my family
and may not make it.

591
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,240
Don't forget it.

592
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,079
Okay, got it.

593
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:29,680
Bye.

594
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,079
Put on the helmet.

595
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:34,599
Okay.

596
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,359
See you later.

597
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,159
See you later.

598
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,760
(The sound of firecrackers
marks the beginning of the year.)

599
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,280
(The whole nation welcomes
the new year together.)

600
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,799
(Let's follow the reporter)

601
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:59,639
(and take a look at the special dinners
on Lunar New Year's Eve.)

602
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:02,832
Sis, make some fried tomatoes.

603
00:32:02,832 --> 00:32:03,520
Okay.

604
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,440
Aren't these enough for you?

605
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,280
But I want tomatoes.

606
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,599
We're running out of space.

607
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,240
Give it to me.

608
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,799
They closed the supermarket too soon.

609
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:19,520
You've been busy the whole year.

610
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,000
Why do you feel bad about
some petty money from those meals?

611
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,639
You have no idea.

612
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:26,119
The doctors
from the hospital across the street

613
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,920
like the meals I make.

614
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:32,520
Now I have to see
what nice dishes you've been

615
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,200
serving them.

616
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,520
Nice. They look amazing and smell nice.

617
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,639
We can heat them and share them.

618
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:38,864
Okay.

619
00:32:38,864 --> 00:32:40,440
And there are clams.

620
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,399
Sheng wrote me the recipe.

621
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,680
Sheng, I'm impressed.

622
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,079
What's wrong?

623
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,159
Smells great. So many dishes.

624
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:58,200
I heard you were writing recipes.

625
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,920
What? Are you learning cooking
from your mom?

626
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,520
Me? Even Peanut

627
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,000
wouldn't eat what I make.

628
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,639
She's never good at cooking.

629
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:11,839
That won't do.

630
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:14,799
Who's going to cook
once your parents grow old?

631
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,760
Will you get takeouts for them all day?

632
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,359
Find someone who can cook.

633
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,960
Well, in that case,

634
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,879
Sheng must look for someone
who can cook.

635
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:26,680
That's the top criterion.

636
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,240
Go ahead. See you.

637
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,760
She's so shy.

638
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,040
She's a grown kid now.

00:33:37,876 --> 00:33:40,336
(First People's Hospital)

640
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:52,079
They're working overtime
and someone came to pick on them.

641
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:54,480
Take it to the pediatrician
for condolence.

642
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,799
We know each other well.
It's not needed.

643
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,319
It's the Lunar New Year's Eve.

644
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:02,440
I'm off now.

645
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,440
Take it to them.

646
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,528
Say it's from you.

647
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:08,240
I'm getting the credit for what you did?

648
00:34:09,279 --> 00:34:10,079
You...

649
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,159
Take care.

650
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,239
Bye.

651
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:26,440
Wait, I'm off work too.

652
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,079
Sheng, I went to the heating company.

653
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,599
They said it wasn't easy
to add heating to old houses.

654
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:36,759
So I got you a heater.

655
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:37,800
Get by with it.

656
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,000
Thank you, big brother.

657
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,480
Thank you.

658
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,199
You boys.

659
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,679
I fixed your window.

660
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,119
It's sealed now.

661
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,119
Your hands won't freeze
when you play the piano now.

662
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,279
Do you like the new paper cut?

663
00:34:49,279 --> 00:34:50,520
Yeah, thank you, fourth brother.

664
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,400
No problem.

665
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,320
I bought you an air heater.

666
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,719
Turn it on if the heater isn't enough.

667
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,440
One is enough.

668
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,079
That's unnecessary.

669
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,920
She feels cold.

670
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,800
It's the same as big brother's.

671
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,199
You should have asked him. It's too hot.

672
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:07,279
Easy. I like it, third brother.

673
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:09,480
I like it a lot. Thanks.

674
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,239
Okay, give it to me.

675
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,000
I got this.

676
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,239
Let me.

677
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,719
No need. You don't know where it is.

678
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:15,279
Sheng, come here.

679
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,279
Check out the diet recipe

680
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:18,599
I prepared for you.

681
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:19,480
Sauces included.

682
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,559
You only have to warm it.

683
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:23,199
No need.
We're right next to the grocery stores.

684
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:25,960
Yeah, it's unnecessary.

685
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,599
You have to wash those before cooking.

686
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:31,400
Now, Sheng can watch TV
and have fun with Grandpa.

687
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,119
Or she can play the piano
and write songs, right?

688
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:33,559
Come on.

689
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:36,239
Second brother, I love it.

690
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,440
I even put fruits.

691
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,800
It's fine. Big brother.

692
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,159
- Any drinks?
- I got this.

693
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:41,000
So talkative.

694
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
You got a humidifier, huh?

695
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,480
It's just the winter holiday.

696
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,079
Why are they so nervous?

697
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,880
What? You're jealous?

698
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,119
I dare not.

699
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:51,800
She's our only sister.

700
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,079
I dare not envy her.

701
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:55,239
She's born lucky.

702
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,119
That's right.

703
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,119
Come on. Help with the chores.

704

Mr. Mo, aren't you going home?

My parents aren't there. I'll be alone.

736
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,624
Online relationship.

737
00:37:40,624 --> 00:37:41,199
Nonsense.

738
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,000
Online relationship.

739
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,840
I...

740
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,339
(It's almost nine. Where are you?)
I don't have time for that.

741
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:44,840
It's nine.

742
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,904
I'll be in my room.

743
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,880
Sheng is going upstairs.

744
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,759
Give her some food.

745
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:49,599
Yeah, take some.

746
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,719
No need. Too much. That's enough.

747
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:54,960
Pork jerky. Duck neck.

748
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,040
Wait.

749
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,279
You gave her so many snacks.

750
00:37:57,279 --> 00:37:59,280
She's going to be thirsty. Take it.

751
00:38:00,304 --> 00:38:01,960
Thanks. See you later.

752
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,480
Alright.

753
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:02,992
Hold on.

754
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,040
You swear you're not
dating someone, fourth brother?

755
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,920
Come on, don't be so gossipy.

756
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,199
See you. I'll be upstairs. Have fun.

757
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:13,159
I'll be upstairs.

758
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:14,079
So many snacks.

759
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:23,376
Shengshengman is here.

760
00:38:23,376 --> 00:38:24,592
(Happy New Year, Mr. Qiang)

761
00:38:29,584 --> 00:38:30,512
(Shengshengman is the admin?)

762
00:38:30,512 --> 00:38:32,248
(No prying. Focus on the works
Calling Shengshengman)

763
00:38:32,628 --> 00:38:36,048
(Admin: Shengshengman)

764
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,040
(1 message from Qiang Qingci)
(When did I become an admin?)

765
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:44,079
(We made you a temporary admin
just to make things easier.)

766
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,480
(Okay, thanks.)

767
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:53,400
(Enter the admin's room.
We're talking about a song recording.)

768
00:38:54,836 --> 00:38:56,559
(Admin group of the Perfect Voice)

769
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:59,239
(Wang Ke)
As the leader of the Perfect Voice,

770
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:03,000
I suggest we come up with a pre-release

771
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,960
as a gift for the fans.

772
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,639
Then we'll release

773
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:09,480
the official song
as a formal gift on the anniversary.

774
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,159
Good idea.

775
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:13,840
We can take our time
and work on the formal song.

776
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,880
The pre-release can be easy.

777
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,040
Let's find something we all like.

778
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,920
You're a senior member. I'm the leader.
But neither of us have a say.

779
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,360
It's been three years.
Our protagonist is Qiang Qingci.

780
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:29,639
Sheng.

781
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,119
I'm here.

782
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,800
I remember you like
the traditional Chinese style.

783
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,759
Yeah.

784
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:42,759
What's your favorite song?

785
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:46,840
Golden Age.

786
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,664
Golden Age?

787
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,000
That's it then.

788
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:55,040
Fine by me.

789
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,480
It's quite known.

790
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,119
And it needs many singers.

791
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:02,199
We need six singers and one narrator.

792
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,360
We're the Perfect Voice.

793
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,079
I say we present it
with the best casting.

794
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:08,480
So many singers? So sudden?

795
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,559
And the best casting?

796
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:12,239
It's the festival.
How do we even invite them?

797
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:16,320
Sheng, who do you have in mind?

798
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,079
Me?

799
00:40:19,279 --> 00:40:23,239
Who would you invite
if you were the producer?

800
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,159
Feishao, Linglong, Momo'er,

801
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:31,800
Wang Ke, Beidou, Jianjian.

802
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,599
And you have to be the narrator.

803
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,000
Me?

804
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:48,656
That's easy.
But the singers you mentioned...

805
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:51,000
They are quite senior in this circle.

806
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,440
Many only hold concerts
and don't sing new songs.

807
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,599
Some don't even hold concerts.

808
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,320
They're just gone

809
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,759
and become legends.

810
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,679
For example, Momo'er.

811
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:05,559
Momo'er.

812
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:10,608
What do you think, Doudoubing?

813
00:41:10,608 --> 00:41:11,952
(Welcome home)

814
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:18,279
Alright, Sheng. I'm flattered.

815
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:19,280
I'm Momo'er.

816
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,599
Very surprising, huh?

817
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:28,480
Doudou, you're Momo'er?

818
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,279
That's me.

819
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,840
But you've been gone for ages.

820
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,960
I never knew that you'd be hiding
in the Perfect Voice Studio.

821
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,288
(Feng Yasong)
Surprise, huh?

822
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:40,719
Doudou has two major accounts.

823
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:42,880
You're praising me? That's rare.

824
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,920
I'm just stating the fact.

825
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,559
Let's see if the others

826
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:49,920
will join us for the sake of Mr. Qiang.

827
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,800
Okay, I'll ask them.

828
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,840
But...

829
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,599
But if I remember it right,

830
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,599
Linglong is

831
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,800
a hardcore fan of Qiang Qingci.

832
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,639
A hardcore fan. Sheng, think it through.

833
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:06,320
Will you give up Qiang Qingci to her?

834
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:12,800
We don't need her.
Let Shengshengman sing that part.

835
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:21,440
Sheng, you'll go viral.

836
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,800
No, I can't.

837
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,759
Have some faith in yourself.

838
00:42:26,759 --> 00:42:28,960
We're not on the same level.

839
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,840
They're seniors. I'm a newbie.

840
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,599
And I work behind the screen.

841
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:36,199
I can compose and write lyrics.
But singing...

842
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:37,159
You got this.

843
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,079
It's not about popularity.
It's about capability.

844
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:46,239
Yeah, hasn't everyone
started from the ground up?

845
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:49,239
Try it. It's just a pre-release anyway.

846
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:50,800
It's a gift for the fans.

847
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,800
Take it easy.

848
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,759
Okay, I'll try it.

849
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,800
They're my favorite singers.

850
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,679
I never even dreamed of
working with them.

851
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:08,000
