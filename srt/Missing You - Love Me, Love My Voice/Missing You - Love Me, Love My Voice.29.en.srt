25
00:01:42,608 --> 00:01:44,816
(What do you think
is behind the island?)

26
00:01:48,196 --> 00:01:50,317
Mr. Qiang, go for it!

27
00:01:59,517 --> 00:02:00,077
Right,

28
00:02:01,317 --> 00:02:02,437
I just thought of something.

29
00:02:05,196 --> 00:02:07,440
How will you spend
your National Holiday?

30
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:10,916
National Holiday?
I haven't thought about it.

31
00:02:13,076 --> 00:02:15,877
I'll have a seminar in Qiandao Lake
for the first four days.

32
00:02:16,317 --> 00:02:20,676
If you are not doing anything,
come to Qiandao Lake with us.

33
00:02:21,796 --> 00:02:24,356
Sure. Qiandao Lake.

34
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,756
- I haven't been there yet.
- That's a deal then.

35
00:02:31,157 --> 00:02:33,756
Last time I told my parents
that I was in Yangshuo for business.

36
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:40,796
How should I tell my parents this time?
They are quite strict.

37
00:02:43,157 --> 00:02:46,236
I met your grandfather. If needed,

38
00:02:46,676 --> 00:02:48,956
I can arrange for my parents to meet
your parents.

39
00:02:51,956 --> 00:02:52,837
I'm serious.

40
00:02:55,756 --> 00:03:00,317
No need. I'll think of a way.

41
00:03:01,837 --> 00:03:02,956
By myself.

42
00:03:03,956 --> 00:03:04,956
Myself.

43
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:15,397
(Wangjia Supermarket)

44
00:03:15,397 --> 00:03:19,236
Okay, I can go together with you.
So that your parents can rest assured.

45
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:22,877
- Who dares to act out when I'm there?
- What are you talking about?

46
00:03:22,956 --> 00:03:24,437
Mr. Mo has nothing to hide.

47
00:03:24,557 --> 00:03:26,756
He will act properly
even though you are not there.

48
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:29,117
Fine, you are always right.

49
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:32,676
The Perfect Voice Studio appreciated it
a lot that you treated them with snacks.

50
00:03:32,756 --> 00:03:34,288
We can go together if you are available.

51
00:03:35,397 --> 00:03:38,877
I didn't say yes for you.
I'm afraid you already have plans.

52
00:03:38,956 --> 00:03:42,157
- No, I don't have any plan.
- Look at you.

53
00:03:42,277 --> 00:03:44,277
Show some of the spirit you use on me
and be proud for once.

54
00:03:44,277 --> 00:03:46,992
Say you need to go home.

55
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:48,752
I'm never proud
when facing brilliant people.

56
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:53,437
Sheng, when will you leave?
Let me know. I will check the tickets.

57
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:56,756
We will buy tickets together
and settle the money later.

58
00:03:57,597 --> 00:04:00,756
Thank them for me. I'll definitely go.

59
00:04:00,877 --> 00:04:02,997
- Got it.
- I'm going to work now.

60
00:04:05,277 --> 00:04:09,717
Sheng, I can go for you.
So the money for the hotel and plane...

61
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:13,476
How can you be so shameless?
You go out and let your sister pay?

62
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:18,052
Fine, I'll reluctantly pay myself

63
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:21,651
to go enjoy a holiday
with the one you admire.

64
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:25,771
Others can't get this kind of chance,
and you are picky about it.

65
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:29,452
- I don't know him. That's your idol.
- Alright, get off.

66
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:39,651
(May all the people in Chaisang
never leave their families like me.)

67
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:44,411
- (May all soldiers guard rivers...)
- This speech is so touching.

68
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:50,480
- Right?
- (May we expel the outsiders one day)

69
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,032
- Your phone's ringing.
- (and forever eliminate warfare.)

70
00:04:54,032 --> 00:04:55,024
Your phone is ringing.

71
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:00,560
(Zhou Zheng)

72
00:05:04,548 --> 00:05:06,949
You continue. I'll take a call.

73
00:05:14,108 --> 00:05:16,949
- Hello?
- Hey, long time no see.

74
00:05:19,228 --> 00:05:25,509
Not that long. My roommates and I
went to see your show last time.

75
00:05:26,228 --> 00:05:27,629
We've kind of met then.

76
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:31,629
How would you spend your holiday?

77
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:39,548
- I have no idea.
- Then what about we spend it together?

78
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:42,749
The Top Three in Perfect Voice
are excellent.

79
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:45,108
Look at Juemei, so good-shaped.

80
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,629
Another flower high upon the ridges.
I wonder who will get him.

81
00:05:59,908 --> 00:06:03,709
- Uh, I...
- Thank your friend for me.

82
00:06:23,228 --> 00:06:24,269
Still feel regretful?

83
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,896
Am I?

84
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:31,389
You didn't even eat.
You may fool others but not me.

85
00:06:33,988 --> 00:06:37,389
I'm not upset.

86
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:43,548
It's just Perfect Voice hosts this event
and Mr. Qiang will withdraw.

87
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:47,108
I feel pity that I can't participate in.

88
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:53,424
But I feel happy Off Key can be there.
Anyway, newcomers can take over.

89
00:06:54,468 --> 00:06:55,709
You grow up.

90
00:06:57,228 --> 00:06:58,800
Now showing the demeanor of the elder.

91
00:06:59,428 --> 00:07:02,749
It's as if you're so much older
and I'm so much younger.

92
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:05,189
- I don't eat.
- Don't eat?

93
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:08,788
I was gonna share some delicious food
from the fridge with you.

94
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:11,269
- Forget about it.
- No, don't forget it.

95
00:07:11,908 --> 00:07:14,228
It's my fault.

96
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:17,348
- What? I can't hear you.
- My fault.

97
00:07:26,428 --> 00:07:31,949
- The braised duck legs made by my dad.
- That's my favorite.

98
00:07:32,548 --> 00:07:34,308
- Especially made for me?
- Of course!

99
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:36,269
He asked me to take it cuz you love it.

100
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,829
Last night he didn't let me
eat a lot to save them for you.

101
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:41,868
Say thanks to him for me.
He is like my half dad.

102
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:48,308
No, if one day you fall in love with me.
Then he would be my father-in-law.

103
00:07:48,788 --> 00:07:52,788
- My dad doesn't have that fortune.
- Stop that. I don't have that fortune.

104
00:07:52,908 --> 00:07:56,069
- Your parents are so kind.
- That's her parents.

105
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:58,149
That won't make Doudou
fall in love with you.

106
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:01,749
I don't expect her to like me.
I just want braised duck legs.

107
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:03,389
Eat.

108
00:08:12,548 --> 00:08:14,388
What? Are you in love with me?

109
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:17,108
Don't smile so sweet,
or I may confess to you.

110
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:21,629
Doudou, come back.

111
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:27,788
Mr. Mo will have a meeting next week
and he lets us go together to have fun.

112
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:29,328
You can organize it.

113
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:33,668
- Why you two don't do it?
- Let me help you.

114
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:37,708
Let him help you. I might not go.

115
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:41,269
I can only take a day off for holiday.
I will see how it goes.

116
00:08:42,068 --> 00:08:44,149
You can only take one day off?

117
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:47,068
No choice. We're short-staffed.

118
00:08:48,948 --> 00:08:51,029
What, do you want me to go?

119
00:08:54,428 --> 00:08:56,848
Everyone wants you to go.
Everyone should be there.

120
00:08:57,948 --> 00:08:58,588

if there's anything you want to eat,
drink, or play,

147
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:46,029
just let me know.
I'm familiar with here.

148

Feishao, aren't you from Ancheng?

expand to Qiandao Lake?

You are truly a businessman.

151
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,296
Do you have any recommendations?

152
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,908
Off-roaders and hot air balloons,
have you tried? They're available here.

153
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:03,869
Off-roaders? On the island?

154
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:08,029
Yes, in the mud. It's thrilling.
I play it every time I come here.

155
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:09,509
No more rolling?

156
00:11:09,989 --> 00:11:12,989
- Can we go and try this?
- I will go with you if you want to.

157
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:18,948
Sleepy?

158
00:11:20,788 --> 00:11:23,978
Yesterday, I had to do both
recording songs and live streaming.

159
00:11:23,978 --> 00:11:25,828
I didn't even get two hours of sleep.

160
00:11:25,828 --> 00:11:29,349
- Get some sleep as we get to the hotel.
- Then the whole morning would be wasted.

161
00:11:30,788 --> 00:11:33,869
Sleep first to have the energy
to have fun, right?

162

The environment is quite nice, isn't it?

163

- Must be!

164
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:11,788
Guys, the place isn't inferior to that
Zhu organized in Yangshuo, is it?

165
00:12:11,788 --> 00:12:13,428
- Better.
- Much better.

166
00:12:13,548 --> 00:12:15,788
- Not bad.
- I booked all the three buildings.

167
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:19,428
One with two floors, for four.
Let me make the arrangement.

168
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:24,629
Mr. Mo, you two stay in this building.
It's more peaceful for a couple.

169
00:12:24,948 --> 00:12:27,149
- Xiaoxing, stay with me.
- Sure.

170
00:12:27,308 --> 00:12:29,389
- Xiaoxing, get the room card.
- Then I will stay with Mr. Mo.

171
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,389
No, no, no, I need to stay
with my sister.

172
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,548
I'm in an unfamiliar place, so awkward.
Can you stay with me?

173
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:37,749
I'm no less unfamiliar with this
place than you are.

174
00:12:37,749 --> 00:12:40,208
Yiru, we can share a bed.
We four stay together.

175
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,389
- Yes, you stay with us.
- Alright.

176
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:43,708
Come on, cut the crap.
You live in this building.

177
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:44,908
- Come on.
- Room card, room card.

178
00:12:44,908 --> 00:12:45,828
- Give me.
- That way.

179
00:12:45,828 --> 00:12:48,068
- Come with us.
- This way, this way.

180
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:49,749
- Room 932.
- Let's go.

181
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:51,509
- Hurry up.
- You come with us.

182
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:54,068
-Let's go, brothers.
-Let's go, guys.

183
00:12:54,188 --> 00:12:56,469
We are the four single wolves
in the wind.

184
00:12:59,188 --> 00:13:00,469
- Be careful.
- It's ok. Let me do it.

185
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:07,349
- Xiaoxing, we choose the second floor.
- Sure.

186
00:13:08,469 --> 00:13:09,908
Sure, come on.

187
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:11,989
- What about the luggages?
- I'll help you carry it.

188
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:13,588
- Let's go.
- Go upstairs to see.

189
00:13:20,788 --> 00:13:22,389
The view is so charming, Sheng.

190
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:24,908
- A big forest.
- I'll place the luggages here.

191
00:13:24,908 --> 00:13:26,509
- Call us if you need help.
- Thanks.

192
00:13:26,668 --> 00:13:28,229
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

193
00:13:32,548 --> 00:13:36,989
Sheng, I'll take a shower and have a rest.
I felt too excited yesterday to sleep.

194
00:13:37,229 --> 00:13:37,708
Okay.

195
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:43,708
- You just lie here in such a good day?
- Tired.

196
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:44,908
So comfortable!

197
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:47,749
Mr. Mo, where are we going
in the afternoon?

198
00:13:48,948 --> 00:13:49,989
No idea yet.

199
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:52,668
I'll go get you some drinks.

200
00:13:52,828 --> 00:13:54,989
- I want coke.
- Me too, thanks.

201
00:13:56,428 --> 00:14:01,269
- You won't go out?
- Sleepy. I was on duty last night.

202
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:03,349
I'm embarrassed

203
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:06,869
to sleep with Gu Sheng's brother
on one large double bed.

204
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:10,188
I would rather do sunbathe outside.

205
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:13,149
Why is Mu also asleep?

206
00:14:14,668 --> 00:14:18,828
He had a parents' meeting yesterday.
Lots of parents talked to him.

207
00:14:18,948 --> 00:14:22,588
After coming home, his mom
talked about dating with him.

208
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:27,629
And his sister woke him up to talk
because she has pressure on study.

209
00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:29,149
That really wore him out.

210
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:33,428
- How come you know everything?
- He complained the whole way.

211
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:48,269
- Do you want to see the lake?
- Not in a hurry.

212
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:50,708
You said you are sleepy. So sleep first.

213
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:55,629
I don't want
to waste three days sleeping.

214
00:14:58,068 --> 00:15:01,828
I've gone on long journeys
with you twice.

215
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:06,908
It's my great honor.

216
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:20,029
Sheng, do you want some drinks?

217
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,629
No, thank you.

218
00:15:31,188 --> 00:15:36,149
I'll go change into clean clothes.
I've been sitting in the car all day.

219
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,788
Juemei went out for a walk.
You can stay in my room for a while.

220
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:40,428
Let's go.

221
00:16:47,349 --> 00:16:48,029
Sleepy?

222
00:16:49,428 --> 00:16:53,828
Little. Xiaoxing occupied the whole
bed when sleeping upstairs.

223
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:57,708
Maybe you can rest a little in bed
and then we can go out.

224
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:10,909
Don't you feel tired after all the
meetings? Do you want to sleep a little?

225
00:17:11,628 --> 00:17:12,304
I'm fine.

226
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:17,509
We're out for a vacation, after all.
Sleep if you're tired, and go out later.

227
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:19,588
You sleep. I'll read books for a while.

Quietly.

252
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:24,269
I will go upstairs and get ready.

253
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:38,949
The air is so fresh after the rain.

254
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:41,509
It was drizzling just now.

255
00:20:45,388 --> 00:20:45,989
Are you happy?

256
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:51,108
Yes. Very happy.

257
00:20:53,949 --> 00:20:57,308
- Where did you go?
- Just went out and walked a while.

258
00:20:57,588 --> 00:20:59,348
To see what's good to eat and
where can we have fun.

259
00:20:59,628 --> 00:21:01,749
So I can take you there
after you wake up.

260
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:22,388
See, there's a lovely island.

261
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:30,588
That one?

262
00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:37,308
Can you tell what's behind the island?

263
00:21:41,628 --> 00:21:42,308
You want to know?

264
00:21:58,029 --> 00:21:59,548
Wow! So beautiful!

265
00:22:03,308 --> 00:22:04,148
Careful!

266
00:22:07,388 --> 00:22:07,868
See.

267
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:12,749
That island.

268
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:15,909
Now you know what's behind there.

269
00:22:17,068 --> 00:22:17,989
I know now.

270
00:22:19,469 --> 00:22:19,989
See!

271
00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:10,308
Coming!

272
00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:13,949
- Zhou Zheng, hurry.
- Come on, come on, come on.

273
00:23:14,588 --> 00:23:15,749
You throw it so far.

274
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:20,029
- Ready to jump.
- One, two, three, go!

275
00:23:23,868 --> 00:23:25,388
- Let's go
- You first.

276
00:23:28,348 --> 00:23:29,229
So fun!

277
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:33,669
Wait, where is my sister?
Where did she go?

278
00:23:34,068 --> 00:23:35,989
- I will go look for her.
- Wait.

279
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:37,949
You go down first!

280
00:23:39,989 --> 00:23:40,868
Splash water on him.

281
00:23:47,108 --> 00:23:47,989
Are there any balls?

282
00:23:51,308 --> 00:23:54,669
Zhou Zheng, what are you doing?
You don't take off your clothes or swim.

283
00:23:54,788 --> 00:23:56,348
- That's true.
- You arranged us to swim.

284
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:57,949
But now you don't do anything.

285
00:23:58,068 --> 00:24:01,588
Juemei, have you grown wings or a tail?
Why aren't you swimming?

286
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:03,068
Exactly.

287
00:24:03,788 --> 00:24:04,909
Can't I just warm-up?

288
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:15,148
- Sorry I am late.
- Baby.

289
00:24:15,548 --> 00:24:16,029
Quickly, come.

290
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,509
He took off.

291
00:24:28,469 --> 00:24:30,429
- Good body shape!
- Wow.

292
00:24:32,108 --> 00:24:34,068
You see, he just wants to show off.

293
00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:40,229
- Wow!
- Cool!

294
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:43,068
- A large black fish.
- That's cool.

295
00:24:43,989 --> 00:24:44,588
Go!

296
00:24:45,828 --> 00:24:49,469
Yiru, you should thank Xiaoxing. We
can't get such benefits without her.

297
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:51,429
- What are you talking about?
- Thank you, Xiaoxing.

298
00:24:51,628 --> 00:24:55,989
I was wondering why he was delaying.
He was waiting for someone, huh?

299
00:24:55,989 --> 00:24:59,788
- Keep your voice down. Embarrassing.
- There is something we don't know.

300
00:24:59,868 --> 00:25:02,108
Scheming boy, come here.

301
00:25:02,148 --> 00:25:04,108
- Coming.
- Coming.

302
00:25:04,108 --> 00:25:06,669
- You don't go swimming?
- No, I don't.

303
00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:08,509
- And you?
- Me neither.

304
00:25:08,828 --> 00:25:10,709
I'll go then.

305
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:15,669
Feng Yasong, I'm coming!

306
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,229
- So cold!
- The water is so cold.

307
00:25:23,709 --> 00:25:24,828
Hurry up!

308
00:25:27,548 --> 00:25:31,949
Dong Yiru, why my sister isn't here yet?
Is she with Mo Qingcheng?

309
00:25:32,068 --> 00:25:35,348
- I have to go and find her.
- No.

310
00:25:35,348 --> 00:25:36,909
Come here.

311
00:26:27,229 --> 00:26:29,548
Is that fine that we don't go swimming?

312
00:26:30,949 --> 00:26:33,429
They are too noisy. Let them have fun.

313
00:26:35,229 --> 00:26:37,029
It's dark now, anyway.

314
00:26:38,588 --> 00:26:39,828
I guess they will come back soon.

315
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:05,348
So beautiful! So many stars!

316
00:27:06,788 --> 00:27:09,388
Normally, we can't see so
many stars in the city.

317
00:27:11,068 --> 00:27:12,469
Have you seen Sagittarius constellation?

318
00:27:14,709 --> 00:27:16,269
Which one is it?

319
00:27:17,949 --> 00:27:18,469
That one.

320
00:27:23,888 --> 00:27:24,464
Which one?

321
00:27:25,548 --> 00:27:26,709
Sit down.

322
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:30,480
- Where?
- There.

323
00:27:31,536 --> 00:27:32,688
There, do you see?

324
00:27:33,776 --> 00:27:36,749
There's a triangle on top
and a quadrilateral at the bottom.

325
00:27:38,348 --> 00:27:42,068
I see. A quadrilateral on the bottom
and a triangle on top.

326
00:27:45,108 --> 00:27:46,388
What other constellations are there?

327
00:27:47,588 --> 00:27:48,229
Let me see.

328
00:27:51,348 --> 00:27:52,269
Let's lie down.

329
00:27:59,429 --> 00:27:59,868
There.

330
00:28:00,949 --> 00:28:02,308
In that direction, a bit farther away.

331
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:07,628
- That one is the Scorpio constellation.
- Scorpio, what does it look like?

332
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:12,148
- "S" shape.
- "S" shape?

333
00:28:15,588 --> 00:28:17,429
Like this. Do you see?

334
00:28:19,628 --> 00:28:21,229
I see. "S" shape.

335
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:23,760
So beautiful.

336
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:28,308
It's a pity I didn't bring my phone.
It would be nice to have some music.

337
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:40,308
The last song you sang that day
was particularly beautiful.

338
00:28:42,469 --> 00:28:42,949
You like it?

339
00:28:46,909 --> 00:28:48,144
Actually that day,

340
00:28:49,189 --> 00:28:50,909
I sang it too serious.

00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:53,949
Is there any way not serious?

342
00:28:57,148 --> 00:28:57,868
Want to hear?

343
00:28:59,949 --> 00:29:01,148
How about you sing it without music?

344
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,469
Okay.

357
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:35,868
It's not your sister.

358
00:30:36,828 --> 00:30:39,469
Well, why in such a hurry?

359
00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:42,229
Your sister has already grown up.
She can't get lost.

360
00:30:42,229 --> 00:30:44,108
Go, quickly!

361
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:51,189
- Gu Jia, what's wrong? Slow down!
- Dong Yiru, hurry up!

362
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:55,828
What are you doing? I'm getting along
well with my idol happily.

363
00:30:55,949 --> 00:30:58,949
- But why did you call me back?
- I didn't drag you down today.

364
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:02,469
After all, my sister didn't come today.
I am just worried.

365
00:31:02,588 --> 00:31:06,229
What could happen to your sister when
she's with someone else? She's an adult.

366
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:07,749
Be mature.

367
00:31:09,709 --> 00:31:10,308
See.

368
00:31:14,348 --> 00:31:18,308
This cola is obviously just poured.
It's still cold.

369
00:31:22,308 --> 00:31:25,189
- Is it cold? Isn't it nice to drink?
- I don't want to talk to you.

370
00:31:27,108 --> 00:31:29,828
No, what are you doing, Gu Jia?

371
00:31:29,949 --> 00:31:32,068
I did just see this light
flicker off for a moment.

372
00:31:32,189 --> 00:31:34,108
Could you please stop being so
suspicious and paranoid?

373
00:31:34,348 --> 00:31:37,429
- Gu Sheng.
- Wait.

374
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:41,029
You are impolite when they are here,
and you are awkward when they aren't.

375
00:31:41,709 --> 00:31:44,788
Here, play with me,
and I'll search with you, okay?

376
00:31:46,108 --> 00:31:49,269
- Play while searching.
- Play while searching. Is that okay?

377
00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:51,068
Okay, hurry up.

378
00:31:51,068 --> 00:31:52,949
- Play while searching.
- Play while searching.

379
00:31:53,348 --> 00:31:56,189
Look, how lively it is over there.
They must be enjoying the night.

380
00:31:56,189 --> 00:31:57,348
- How can they go back?
- There.

381
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,308
Yes. See, there. Let's go.

382
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:04,909
- Seems like they are gone.
- Gone.

383
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:13,229
Wait, wait, don't turn it on.
What if they come back?

384
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:20,669
- It's not right.
- What's wrong?

385
00:32:21,229 --> 00:32:24,788
We just sat in the courtyard.
We didn't really do anything.

386
00:32:26,148 --> 00:32:29,388
Hiding like this makes it seem as if
we've really done something wrong.

387
00:32:35,108 --> 00:32:37,709
Do you want coke? I'll pour you a glass.

388
00:32:39,308 --> 00:32:41,469
Keep your voice down, in case they hear.

389
00:32:43,348 --> 00:32:44,029
Okay.

390
00:33:07,628 --> 00:33:08,308
Sleepy?

391
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:13,548
I just slept a little in the afternoon.

392
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:35,749
I will lower the AC for you.

393
00:33:37,469 --> 00:33:39,068
It's comfortable
to sleep with the blanket.

394
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:14,548
- Good night.
- Good night.

395
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:16,548
Let's sleep.

396
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:31,429
Actually swimming is quite easy.

397
00:34:31,548 --> 00:34:33,949
Tilt your head back, sweep with
your hands, and push with your feet.

398
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:34,909
(Don't come back tonight.)

399
00:34:39,309 --> 00:34:41,668
(Sheng is asleep.
You go somewhere else to sleep.)

400
00:34:45,029 --> 00:34:46,389
What's wrong? Why are you laughing?

401
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:54,108
Are you hungry? How about we find a
restaurant and have a late-night meal?

402
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:56,789
Sure!

403
00:35:03,628 --> 00:35:06,789
My throat is a bit uncomfortable.
I may have a cold. Do you have medicine?

404
00:35:06,989 --> 00:35:08,429
I do. I will get it for you.

405
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:11,148
- So you go first. I'll find you later.
- Okay.

406
00:35:11,148 --> 00:35:12,628
- I'll send you the address.
- Okay.

407
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:15,268
Doudou, we also feel sick.
Let's go together.

408
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:17,228
- I don't.
- You do.

409
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:18,309
- Me?
- Go.

410
00:35:18,309 --> 00:35:19,668
- Let's go get some medicine.
- Go.

411
00:35:20,228 --> 00:35:21,789
- I will catch up with you later.
- Okay.

412
00:35:24,949 --> 00:35:29,588
- Why are they all sick?
- Maybe poor physical condition.

413
00:35:32,989 --> 00:35:35,009
In the afternoon,
I saw a restaurant over there

414
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:37,068
with quite a few people.
The food should be good.

415
00:35:37,228 --> 00:35:38,509
How about we go there to eat?

416
00:35:39,668 --> 00:35:40,912
- Good idea.
- Let's go.

417
00:35:41,968 --> 00:35:42,608
Go.

418
00:35:49,268 --> 00:35:49,909
Wait.

419
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:56,628
- What's wrong? You took it seriously?
- Why did you come back?

420
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:03,469
- What's wrong, Dong Yiru?
- Something's happening.

421
00:36:08,748 --> 00:36:10,509
I thought you are really sick.

422
00:36:14,469 --> 00:36:17,548
If they notice it, you feel embarrassed,
and if they don't, you are impolite.

423
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:22,148
- Something's happening.
- It's not good to stay long. Go.

424
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:25,029
Let's go. Stop looking.

425
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:36,029
Cold beverages in such cold weather?
I think you'll need that medicine.

426
00:36:36,509 --> 00:36:37,029
Cold?

427
00:36:39,188 --> 00:36:42,268
You are so annoying.

428
00:37:00,389 --> 00:37:04,029
Mr. Mo falls in love and
Zhou Zheng likes that girl.

429
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,469
The only singles are you and me.

430
00:37:13,029 --> 00:37:14,256
Is there any place that we can play?

431
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:16,429
Around here?

432
00:37:17,588 --> 00:37:18,668
Seems like nothing.

433
00:37:20,228 --> 00:37:24,668
Taking this vacation is so uneventful.
A day won't pass by like this, right?

434
00:37:27,188 --> 00:37:31,148
No, it's still two hours to pass.

435
00:37:33,628 --> 00:37:36,628
No, we must do something to do
if everyone else has already.

436
00:37:36,909 --> 00:37:39,188
We can't just go back to sleep
like this. It would be such a waste.

437
00:37:46,628 --> 00:37:47,188
What's wrong?

438
00:37:48,228 --> 00:37:50,108
Forget about it. I don't want to go now.

439
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:52,628
I'd rather stay with you!

440
00:37:54,389 --> 00:37:57,309
You've said everything. Impressive.

441
00:38:02,588 --> 00:38:05,309
Bachelors are not suitable for
couple activities.

442
00:38:10,628 --> 00:38:14,389
Haven't you thought
of having a boyfriend?

443
00:38:16,029 --> 00:38:21,628
- You are single, too. Why rush me?
- Me? I don't have time.

444
00:38:22,548 --> 00:38:23,888
I have time?

445
00:38:23,888 --> 00:38:26,708
You three are busy with your own things,
leaving the recording studio to me.

446
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:30,148
So I need to be dedicated to the studio.
I have time?

447
00:38:31,068 --> 00:38:33,509
And we didn't even bring any medicine
with us when we went out.

448
00:38:33,628 --> 00:38:35,909
I'm in this situation purely because of
being delayed by you guys.

449
00:38:36,068 --> 00:38:40,789
- I would be guilty if you say this.
- Then you better be guilty.

450
00:38:42,108 --> 00:38:45,232
You owe me.
Remember to repay it in the future.

451
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:50,789
Okay, I'll remember this favor.
I won't forget it.

452
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:11,668
Why are you looking at me?
Have you figured out how to repay it?

453
00:39:28,389 --> 00:39:29,429
So tasty.

454
00:39:31,148 --> 00:39:32,909
And this one also!

455
00:39:41,389 --> 00:39:43,909
You weren't full for dinner?
Why are you eating so much?

456
00:39:45,748 --> 00:39:46,608
No, no.

457
00:39:47,628 --> 00:39:52,148
This restaurant is so amazing.
I couldn't stop.

458
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:55,268
I would probably gain
a lot of weight later.

459
00:39:56,349 --> 00:40:00,309
If you're afraid of gaining weight,
I'll go for a walk with you later.

460
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:01,628
To help digest.

461
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:29,268
You always took care of me
when we were in Yangshuo.

462
00:40:31,068 --> 00:40:31,708
Thank you.

463
00:40:34,628 --> 00:40:40,108
I wanted to treat you meal
after we were back to thank you.

464
00:40:40,668 --> 00:40:41,429
However,

465
00:40:42,668 --> 00:40:44,349
I never got a chance.

466
00:40:46,588 --> 00:40:48,068
How about let me treat

467
00:40:49,148 --> 00:40:49,829
this time?

468
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:52,989
No, I've paid the bill.

469
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:56,108
But,

470
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:01,469
after coming back from Yangshuo,

471
00:41:02,949 --> 00:41:07,748
I also wanted to find a chance to drink
coffee or have a meal with you.

472
00:41:09,228 --> 00:41:13,029
I was afraid you might be too busy,
so I didn't dare to disturb you.

473
00:41:25,228 --> 00:41:26,309
But,

474
00:41:33,469 --> 00:41:35,628
but I want to see you.

475
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:42,029
You see me now.

476
00:41:56,628 --> 00:41:59,548
Want a smoothie?
I see they have it here. I'll go buy it.

477
00:42:05,548 --> 00:42:06,509
It's okay.

478
00:42:25,429 --> 00:42:27,228
Didn't you catch a cold?

479
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:29,068
We recovered.

480
00:42:35,188 --> 00:42:35,708
We recovered.

481
00:42:39,548 --> 00:42:43,389
- I will get some smoothies. Want some?
- Mango flavor, please.

482
00:42:43,509 --> 00:42:46,429
- We will go buy it.
- No, tonight it's on me.

483
00:42:47,628 --> 00:42:50,268
So I will go buy it.
You can sit here and wait.

484
00:42:51,509 --> 00:42:53,268
Aren't you sick? Still want smoothies?

485
00:42:55,029 --> 00:42:55,856
Such a coincidence.

486
00:42:57,029 --> 00:42:59,228
What coincidence? What's the point of
pretending now? She has left.

487
00:43:00,068 --> 00:43:02,869
- We encountered. Not to disturb you.
- That's true.

488
00:43:03,349 --> 00:43:04,628
What are you talking about?

489
00:43:04,989 --> 00:43:06,989
She wasn't full
so I just came with her to eat.

490
00:43:07,228 --> 00:43:11,469
Mo Qingcheng is all over his wife,
and doesn't care about her classmate.

491
00:43:19,989 --> 00:43:23,429
- Is it the wrong time for us to come?
- You are late to catch on.

492
00:43:24,148 --> 00:43:25,469
Should we leave now?

493
00:43:25,949 --> 00:43:28,509
And make her throw away the smoothies?
