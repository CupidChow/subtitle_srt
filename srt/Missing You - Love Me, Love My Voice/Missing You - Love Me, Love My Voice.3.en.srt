It's about capability.

27
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:53,053
Yeah, hasn't everyone
started from the ground up?

28
00:01:53,053 --> 00:01:56,053
You try it. It's just
a pre-release anyway.

A gift given back to the fans.

Okay, I'll try.

32

They're all my favorite singers.

33
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,584
I never dreamed of being able
to collaborate with them.

34
00:02:13,584 --> 00:02:14,812
I'll give it my all.

35
00:02:17,092 --> 00:02:21,212
Only Shengshengman is brave enough
to consider a lineup like this.

36
00:02:21,212 --> 00:02:24,133
Only Qiang Qingci can

37
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:26,372
invite so many people.

38
00:02:26,372 --> 00:02:27,772
We haven't collaborated for a long time.

39
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:31,440
It's quite interesting

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,492
to gather together sometimes.

41
00:02:34,372 --> 00:02:35,013
Grandpa.

42
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:38,053
Don't you watch the CCTV Gala?

43
00:02:38,053 --> 00:02:40,053
I've watched it all on Weibo.

44
00:02:40,053 --> 00:02:42,812
It's the Spring Festival.
You won't chat with us?

45
00:02:43,932 --> 00:02:46,252
I'm talking with a few friends
about work.

46
00:02:47,413 --> 00:02:48,092
Dad.

47
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:50,772
You're here.

48
00:02:50,772 --> 00:02:53,013
Sheng, they're about to leave.
Go downstairs.

49
00:02:53,013 --> 00:02:54,013
Right, see them out.

50
00:02:54,013 --> 00:02:54,613
Together.

51
00:02:54,613 --> 00:02:55,573
Okay.

52

(Admin Shengshengman: Excuse me.)

53
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,573
Shengshengman is offline?

54
00:03:02,372 --> 00:03:04,893
It is Lunar New Year's Eve after all.
Family time.

55
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:09,053
Mr. Mo, can I be considered
part of your family?

56
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,492
You flatter me. But it's heartwarming.

57
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:15,333
I made dinner. Would you like some?

58
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,453
No need. Thanks.

59
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:18,733
I'll go back.

60
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:20,893
You're wearing so little. It's cold.

61
00:03:20,893 --> 00:03:22,053
You should wear a coat.

62
00:03:22,053 --> 00:03:23,152
I'll be back shortly.

63
00:03:24,212 --> 00:03:26,453
Uncle, Auntie,
you don't need to see me off.

64
00:03:26,453 --> 00:03:28,573
It's cold, and Grandpa is at home alone.

65
00:03:28,573 --> 00:03:30,013
We'll walk you a bit more.

66
00:03:30,013 --> 00:03:31,492
How about this?

67
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:32,853
You and Sheng go back.

68
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:34,413
I'll see them off.

69
00:03:35,613 --> 00:03:38,652
Okay then. Come to visit another day.

70
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:39,333
Bye.

71
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,112
- Bye.
- Bye.

72
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:42,652
We're leaving.

73
00:03:42,652 --> 00:03:43,413
Come again.

74
00:03:43,413 --> 00:03:44,092
Okay.

75
00:03:44,092 --> 00:03:45,372
Just hurry back.

76
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:48,372
What are you doing?

77
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:48,613
Mom.

78
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:50,492
You've been restless all night.

79
00:03:50,492 --> 00:03:51,893
I just went offline hastily.

80
00:03:51,893 --> 00:03:53,613
I'm afraid they'd misunderstood.

81
00:03:53,613 --> 00:03:54,772
Misunderstood what?

82
00:03:54,772 --> 00:03:57,613
It's nearly midnight.
People should be asleep.

83
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:00,293
Mom, I must hurry.
They tend to sleep late.

84
00:04:00,293 --> 00:04:00,692
You.

85
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:02,212

I'm here.

89
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,492
Why don't you
put on a little show for us?

90
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:15,133
Sure.

91
00:04:16,213 --> 00:04:17,252

some gifts for the festival.

96
00:04:30,692 --> 00:04:32,093
What kind of gifts?

97
00:04:32,093 --> 00:04:33,008
(Here he is. What's it?)

98
00:04:33,008 --> 00:04:33,872

99

Wait. Coming.

Is singing good?

107

- Singing?

108

Sheng, add the subtitles.

109
00:05:02,773 --> 00:05:05,093
I type slowly,
and I haven't done it before.

110
00:05:05,093 --> 00:05:07,053
I'm afraid I can't keep up with you.

111
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:11,408
It doesn't matter. Just feel free.

113
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:19,173

Qiang Qingci anymore.

hear the live version. It's superb.

(Have a great new year. Love you forever.)
(Love you. Glad to meet you.)

00:08:34,293 --> 00:08:35,612
I want to tell you.

170
00:08:37,732 --> 00:08:39,293
Don't be infatuated
with a person too much

171
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:42,133
because of their voice.

172
00:08:44,452 --> 00:08:46,812
You will never know

173
00:08:46,812 --> 00:08:50,212
who the voice
on the other end belongs to,

174
00:08:51,493 --> 00:08:52,092
right?

175
00:08:56,732 --> 00:09:00,253
(Juemei Shayi)
It's okay to like just the voice.

176
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:03,133
Be rational.

177
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:05,413
Never get deceived because of the voice.

Well,

what can I do for you, Mr. Qiang?

210
00:11:29,013 --> 00:11:31,053
(Is it too formal?)

211
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:33,424
Nothing much.

212
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:35,133
I remember you owe me a song.

213

You want to hear it now?

214

Now?

No, what I meant was...

216
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,812
It's too late now. Tomorrow, okay?

217
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:06,452
(He must be busy.)

218
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:14,053
Let me find a song.

219
00:12:21,012 --> 00:12:22,224
(Hold to talk)

220
00:12:22,893 --> 00:12:24,452
(He left so many voice messages.)

221
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:35,692
It's been so long
since I last told you a recipe.

222
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:38,852
Black pepper stir-fried ribs.

223
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,452
It is really good.

224
00:12:42,692 --> 00:12:45,692
Use baby beef ribs.

225
00:12:51,413 --> 00:12:54,653
Debone the ribs.
Add crushed black pepper,

226
00:12:55,653 --> 00:12:58,212
black pepper sauce and rice wine.

227
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:03,280
Then add oil and stir-fry on high heat

228
00:13:04,413 --> 00:13:05,972
until the meat changes color.

229
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:11,533
Then add green onions,
winter bamboo shoots and colored pepper.

230
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,304
Stir-fry on high heat until cooked
and then it's finished.

231
00:13:17,424 --> 00:13:21,612
Black pepper brings
a rich barbecue flavor. It's very nice.

232
00:13:21,612 --> 00:13:26,452
If you don't want baby beef ribs,
you can use beef loin.

233
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:28,612
But baby beef ribs are more suitable.

234
00:13:29,732 --> 00:13:34,253
Okay, it's very late.
Go to bed early. Good night.

235

I lay down,

242
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,173
but I remembered
the kitchen window was not closed.

243
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:48,732

There's a countertop here.

292

293

What's that? It's so cute.

295

00:23:56,213 --> 00:23:56,812
Um.

363
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:08,293
So, have you woken up now?

364
00:24:12,372 --> 00:24:12,973
Um.

365
00:24:20,053 --> 00:24:22,652
Can I talk about something now?

366
00:24:26,892 --> 00:24:27,493
Um.

367
00:24:36,733 --> 00:24:39,172
(Forget it. I won't say it.)

368
00:24:41,973 --> 00:24:45,572
I forgot what I wanted to say.

369
00:24:47,013 --> 00:24:49,693
You can continue to sleep.

370
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:09,533
We can just chat about anything.

371
00:25:13,844 --> 00:25:16,944
(Doctors should be benevolent)

372
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:19,053
Okay.

373
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:25,132
What should we talk about?

374
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,224
(Moqingcheng)

375
00:25:52,812 --> 00:25:54,132
Hello?

376
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:54,896
Hello?

377
00:25:57,652 --> 00:26:00,892
Mr. Qiang, are you not busy?

378
00:26:03,092 --> 00:26:03,812
I am resting.

379
00:26:15,092 --> 00:26:18,733
What do you like to do
when you're resting?

380
00:26:20,253 --> 00:26:22,773
Sleep, or go to the recording studio.

381
00:26:26,372 --> 00:26:29,332
(If I were that hardworking,
I would've won all the awards.)

382
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,372
(Why isn't he speaking?)

383
00:26:43,053 --> 00:26:46,652
Are you going
to the recording studio today too?

384
00:26:48,852 --> 00:26:51,412
Is it for game voice acting?

385
00:26:54,453 --> 00:26:57,104
Well...

386
00:26:57,104 --> 00:27:02,053
You haven't attended the anniversary
of the studio for three years.

387
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:06,013
Why did you attend this year?

388
00:27:07,852 --> 00:27:10,253
It's the 10th anniversary after all.

389
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,332
I had to attend.

390
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,372
It's like an interview.

391
00:27:21,693 --> 00:27:28,412
That's because I really don't know
what you like to talk about.

392
00:27:29,973 --> 00:27:31,933
I've been inactive online for a while.

393
00:27:31,933 --> 00:27:35,293
You can think of me as a friend
that you know in real life.

394
00:27:35,293 --> 00:27:36,652
Just chat about anything.

395
00:27:43,132 --> 00:27:44,013
So,

396
00:27:45,572 --> 00:27:46,852
have you eaten yet?

397
00:27:50,892 --> 00:27:54,652
Yes, this question is quite boring.

398
00:27:55,973 --> 00:27:59,332
It's OK. It's mainly
because we're not familiar enough.

399
00:28:07,973 --> 00:28:11,812
I remember what I wanted to tell you.

400
00:28:11,812 --> 00:28:13,572
No easy feat. Go ahead.

401
00:28:21,852 --> 00:28:23,372
It's okay. You can say it.

402
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:28,213
It's just that...

403
00:28:29,852 --> 00:28:33,612
Because you helped me get
the chance of the collaborative cover,

404
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:35,493
some negative rumors

405
00:28:37,493 --> 00:28:39,372
appeared online.

406
00:28:39,372 --> 00:28:43,092
Actually, my initial thoughts
were really simple.

407
00:28:43,092 --> 00:28:45,132
Being able to collaborate with masters

408
00:28:45,132 --> 00:28:47,412
must be every unknown's pursuit.

409
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,344
But now, I'm just worried

410
00:28:52,368 --> 00:28:55,253
that it will have
a negative impact on you.

411
00:28:57,213 --> 00:28:57,733
Like?

412
00:29:00,332 --> 00:29:01,852
Like...

413
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:04,852
Losing fans.

414
00:29:06,693 --> 00:29:10,013
Lots of gossip.

415
00:29:14,973 --> 00:29:18,412
(He seems so indifferent
as if he doesn't care.)

416
00:29:22,973 --> 00:29:23,533
Come in.

417
00:29:26,572 --> 00:29:27,973
Dr. Mo, please sign here.

418
00:29:28,548 --> 00:29:29,968
(Voice call duration 01:29)
(Someone's asking for me.)

419
00:29:56,733 --> 00:29:59,412
If online comments make you unhappy,

420
00:29:59,412 --> 00:30:02,213
shut the computer off,
and it'll be nothing.

421
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:05,584
As a dubbing actor,

422
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:08,412
the most important thing is my work.

423
00:30:08,412 --> 00:30:10,812
Other than that, what others say

424
00:30:12,092 --> 00:30:13,213
doesn't matter.

425
00:30:22,892 --> 00:30:27,092
Sheng, do you owe me something?

426
00:30:29,253 --> 00:30:31,132
Oh, right. I still owe him a song.

427
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:39,652
I didn't forget. Mr. Qiang,
what do you want to listen to?

428
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,253
I heard from Juemei
you played an instrument.

429
00:30:46,652 --> 00:30:49,533
I learned a bit. I learned the piano
when I was little.

430
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:52,412
Then I self-studied
the guzheng and the flute,

431
00:30:52,412 --> 00:30:55,372
because I like traditional style music.

432
00:30:55,372 --> 00:30:57,733
Would you like me to sing while playing?

433
00:31:01,213 --> 00:31:02,493
If it's okay for you.

434
00:31:04,372 --> 00:31:09,253
Alright, Mr. Qiang, let me prepare.

435
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:12,293
Easy. I'll go to the studio.

436
00:31:16,973 --> 00:31:17,733
The computer.

437
00:31:33,572 --> 00:31:34,933
Happy New Year, Dr. Mo.

438
00:31:34,933 --> 00:31:35,572
Happy New Year.

439
00:31:42,053 --> 00:31:43,652
Why the rough act?

440
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:45,712
- It's hard to get you to treat us.
- Hey.

441
00:31:45,712 --> 00:31:47,984
Will you eat or not? If not, leave.

442
00:31:49,253 --> 00:31:50,852
Mr. Mo is back.

443
00:31:50,852 --> 00:31:52,053
You're finally back.

444
00:31:52,053 --> 00:31:53,172
Come and do me justice.

445
00:31:53,172 --> 00:31:56,172
They made me go grocery shopping
once I got off the plane.

446
00:31:56,172 --> 00:31:58,493
They only talked but didn't do anything.

447
00:31:58,493 --> 00:32:00,132
They can only babble. Look.

448
00:32:00,132 --> 00:32:04,453
Your team asked us to record
during the Chinese New Year.

449
00:32:04,453 --> 00:32:06,533
Shouldn't you treat us?

450
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:10,132
Isn't my early return
worthy of a hot pot?

451
00:32:10,132 --> 00:32:12,132
It's for Mr. Mo. You think it's for you?

452
00:32:12,132 --> 00:32:13,092
Well said.

453
00:32:13,092 --> 00:32:14,572
Is it OK for you to return?

454
00:32:14,572 --> 00:32:16,973
Yeah. I said I came back early
for a blind date.

455
00:32:16,973 --> 00:32:18,892
You really came up with a good excuse.

456
00:32:18,892 --> 00:32:20,933
What's wrong? What a good excuse.

457
00:32:20,933 --> 00:32:24,773
Especially for an eligible bachelor
of age.

458
00:32:27,372 --> 00:32:29,812
Shut up. Sit and eat together.

459
00:32:29,812 --> 00:32:31,773
- Sit.
- I've got some other things. You eat.

460
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:35,092
You upset him and he's gone.

461
00:32:35,092 --> 00:32:35,812
Not eating?

462
00:32:35,812 --> 00:32:36,612
You eat first.

463
00:32:40,773 --> 00:32:43,693
I think something's off with Mr. Mo.

464
00:32:45,293 --> 00:32:46,892
Do you even need to mention it?

465
00:32:46,892 --> 00:32:49,092
I can tell from your forehead wrinkles.

466
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,733
Get lost. I don't have them.

467
00:32:50,733 --> 00:32:52,013
Go away.

468
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:55,933
This time, the long-standing bachelor
is going to be in love.

469
00:33:00,172 --> 00:33:03,652
Love. It's beyond words.

470
00:33:03,652 --> 00:33:05,253
Come on, cheers.

471
00:33:05,253 --> 00:33:06,512
Let's reconcile.

472
00:33:07,572 --> 00:33:08,372
Narrow-minded.

473
00:33:08,372 --> 00:33:09,293
Why didn't you open it?

474
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:10,453
Reluctant?

475
00:33:10,453 --> 00:33:11,453
A bit insincere.

476
00:33:11,453 --> 00:33:11,973
Geez.

477
00:33:29,693 --> 00:33:30,213
I'm here.

478
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:34,652
I'm ready too.
Please go to the chatroom.

479
00:33:40,612 --> 00:33:41,412
The number is...

480
00:33:41,412 --> 00:33:42,053
I'm here.

481
00:33:43,172 --> 00:33:45,693
(Qiang Qingci, Shengshengman)
I came last time so I still remember it.

482
00:33:51,253 --> 00:33:54,733
I'll give you admin rights then.

483
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:55,812
Okay, thanks.

484
00:34:02,453 --> 00:34:04,053
What do you want to listen to?

485
00:34:04,053 --> 00:34:06,253
Whatever you're used to.

486
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:11,373
Then I'll sing the song
from my club exam.

487
00:34:11,373 --> 00:34:14,333
I sang it while playing the instrument.

488
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:15,612
I remember the score.

489
00:34:16,652 --> 00:34:17,813
You have a nice voice.

490
00:34:19,853 --> 00:34:21,072
Good for unaccompanied singing.

491
00:34:23,612 --> 00:34:24,688
Then I'll start now.

492
00:34:25,692 --> 00:34:26,320
Okay.

493
00:34:41,652 --> 00:34:43,772
Sorry, I'm sorry. I'll restart.

494
00:34:47,053 --> 00:34:49,973

Our music director is really talented.

513

(Doudoubing)
Yes, her casual humming is wonderful.

514
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:45,252
It is pure and natural.

515
00:36:45,252 --> 00:36:47,413
No wonder Qiang Qingci likes it.

516
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,813
Mr. Qiang Qingci, Miss Shengshengman,

517
00:36:49,813 --> 00:36:52,292
(Feng Yasong)
sorry to interrupt your date.

518
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:53,373
(When did they come?)

519
00:36:53,373 --> 00:36:55,212
- Doudoubing asked me here.
- Feishao asked me here.

520
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:56,413
Wang Ke called me over.

521
00:36:56,413 --> 00:36:57,493
I'm having hot pot with Juemei.

522
00:36:57,493 --> 00:36:59,824
I'm chatting with Geng Xiaoxing.

523
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,776
(Geng Xiaoxing entered)
I came in by chance.

524
00:37:03,132 --> 00:37:06,933
(Feishao)
Sheng, Mr. Qiang is quite selfish,

525
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,292
continuously kicking us out.

526
00:37:09,292 --> 00:37:11,132
We only heard in bits and pieces.

527
00:37:11,132 --> 00:37:13,292
Exactly, it's like a seesaw battle.

528
00:37:13,292 --> 00:37:14,692
He kicked, and we entered.

529
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:18,732
We just want to see how he...?

530
00:37:21,092 --> 00:37:22,000
Actually, I...

531
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,432
I made a bet with Sheng. She lost,

532
00:37:25,488 --> 00:37:28,013
so she had to sing a few songs for me.

533
00:37:28,013 --> 00:37:33,413
(Did I? But this seems
to be the most reasonable excuse.)

534
00:37:33,413 --> 00:37:35,652
How could I be missing from a bet?

535
00:37:35,652 --> 00:37:37,292
I'm your die-hard fan.

536
00:37:37,292 --> 00:37:39,252
You'd better stop.

537
00:37:39,252 --> 00:37:42,252
Every time Linglong produces a new song,

538
00:37:42,252 --> 00:37:44,893
she lets Mr. Qiang listen to it.

539
00:37:44,893 --> 00:37:48,652
Does our Mr. Qiang
still need songs to listen to?

540
00:37:52,252 --> 00:37:54,652
(So, Linglong is pursuing Qiang Qingci.)

541
00:37:54,652 --> 00:37:56,853
Linglong has a mature lady's voice.

542
00:37:56,853 --> 00:37:58,572
Qiang definitely isn't into that.

543
00:37:58,572 --> 00:38:01,533
Otherwise, they would have been together
for so many years.

544
00:38:01,533 --> 00:38:02,992
(I guess so.)

545
00:38:02,992 --> 00:38:06,453
Our Qiang is done now.

546
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:07,013
Coming.

547
00:38:08,092 --> 00:38:09,652
The meat's gone.

548
00:38:09,652 --> 00:38:10,572
I'll go get some.

549
00:38:10,572 --> 00:38:11,732
I'll just eat veggies.

550
00:38:13,053 --> 00:38:14,533
There are shrimps in the fridge.

551
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:16,172
Okay, I'll get it.

552
00:38:16,172 --> 00:38:17,013
Season it.

553
00:38:17,013 --> 00:38:19,053
Here, coriander and green onions.

554
00:38:19,053 --> 00:38:19,792
Alright.

555
00:38:21,172 --> 00:38:24,413
Here come the shrimps.
I brought you a drink.

556
00:38:25,732 --> 00:38:27,652
Welcome to our hot pot party.

557
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:30,212
Mo has something.

558
00:38:32,212 --> 00:38:33,008
Wang Ke,

559
00:38:34,032 --> 00:38:34,896
there's bird flu.

560
00:38:35,973 --> 00:38:38,384
Mr. Mo, don't scare me.

561
00:38:39,453 --> 00:38:43,413
You guys are too much. There are still
three women here who haven't eaten yet.

562
00:38:43,413 --> 00:38:47,612
Doudou, Mr. Mo can be
quite scary when he's hungry.

563
00:38:47,612 --> 00:38:50,413
I suggest you wait
until he's finished eating.

564
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:51,056
Alright.

565
00:38:52,973 --> 00:38:54,172
Weibo.

566
00:38:54,172 --> 00:38:54,692
Look.

567
00:38:54,692 --> 00:38:55,853
What's going on?

568
00:38:55,853 --> 00:38:57,453
Nothing other than gossip

569
00:38:57,453 --> 00:38:59,453
can make Doudou so excited. Hurry.

570
00:38:59,453 --> 00:39:01,132
Sheng, Weibo, look at Weibo.

571
00:39:03,828 --> 00:39:05,168
(2103 messages)

572
00:39:14,933 --> 00:39:18,373
(It's confirmed?)
(If Mr. Qiang reposts and reveals)

573
00:39:18,373 --> 00:39:20,272
(his favorite voice,
I'll give a box of Haoshi chocolate)

574
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:22,453
(to everyone who leaves a comment below.)

575
00:39:22,453 --> 00:39:23,013
(Pay now.)

576
00:39:32,493 --> 00:39:33,652
He is gonna be broke.

577
00:39:33,652 --> 00:39:35,252
Sure.

578
00:39:35,252 --> 00:39:38,333
With your repost, Shengshengman
became popular in no time.

579
00:39:41,373 --> 00:39:44,053
Sheng, go and cover for your cousin.

580
00:39:44,053 --> 00:39:45,493
He'll be late for his date.

581
00:39:45,493 --> 00:39:47,533
Your dad and I
will go to the supermarket.

582
00:39:47,533 --> 00:39:49,053
Come home later for lunch.

583
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:49,732
Okay.

584
00:39:53,172 --> 00:39:55,373
Sheng, you lost the connection?

585
00:39:57,893 --> 00:40:01,092
Sorry, I have an urgent matter.
I need to go.

586
00:40:01,092 --> 00:40:03,612
See you next time. Bye.

587
00:40:03,612 --> 00:40:06,413
Oh, no. Is she scared?

588
00:40:06,413 --> 00:40:07,533
It scared her away.

589
00:40:14,572 --> 00:40:16,772
Hurry up. Your cousin is in a hurry.

590
00:40:16,772 --> 00:40:20,373
By the way, the girl
who just arrived today is new here.

591
00:40:20,373 --> 00:40:21,413
Take care of her.

592
00:40:21,413 --> 00:40:21,973
Got it.

593
00:40:37,572 --> 00:40:39,132
(What's the big deal?)

594
00:40:39,132 --> 00:40:40,652
(Truly nothing.)

595
00:40:40,652 --> 00:40:43,612
(That kind of joke
is very common online.)

596
00:40:43,612 --> 00:40:46,933
(Moreover, he just said
he liked my voice.)

597
00:40:46,933 --> 00:40:48,053
(It's nothing.)

598
00:40:53,172 --> 00:40:56,772
(But he made
such a heartfelt recommendation.)

599
00:40:56,772 --> 00:40:59,212
(I need to express some gratitude.)

600
00:40:59,212 --> 00:41:01,853
(After all, his posting
one recommendation)

601
00:41:01,853 --> 00:41:04,092
(is more effective than my cover songs.)

602
00:41:23,092 --> 00:41:26,172
(Thank you for your recommendation.)

603
00:41:26,172 --> 00:41:27,172
Who is that?

604
00:41:30,853 --> 00:41:31,373
Who?

605
00:41:33,373 --> 00:41:35,853
Not at all. I am currently eating.

606
00:41:35,853 --> 00:41:38,692
It's inconvenient for me to type.
How about voice chat?

607
00:41:40,612 --> 00:41:41,132
Okay.

608
00:41:42,893 --> 00:41:46,292
So, do you still owe me a few songs?

609
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:52,612
If you're not tired of it,
I'll sing for you anytime.

610
00:41:55,132 --> 00:41:58,092
He's smiling.

611
00:41:59,813 --> 00:42:01,373
Too low. I can't hear it.

612
00:42:01,373 --> 00:42:02,013
Look.

613
00:42:02,013 --> 00:42:03,453
You're not home.

614
00:42:06,053 --> 00:42:07,813
No, I'm about to ride somewhere.

615
00:42:10,292 --> 00:42:11,172
Riding.

616
00:42:11,172 --> 00:42:13,572
Okay. Let's not talk for now. Be safe.

617
00:42:16,692 --> 00:42:17,772
Alright, goodbye.

618
00:42:31,533 --> 00:42:33,413
I'm becoming increasingly curious

619
00:42:33,413 --> 00:42:36,772
about Shengshengman's look.

620
00:42:36,772 --> 00:42:38,853
Juemei, have you ever seen her?

621
00:42:38,853 --> 00:42:40,092
I didn't have a chance.

622
00:42:41,853 --> 00:42:44,172
Mr. Mo, didn't you
always avoid interacting

623
00:42:44,172 --> 00:42:47,252
with strangers on Weibo?

624
00:42:47,252 --> 00:42:49,292
Her voice is nice, so I recommended her.

625
00:42:51,373 --> 00:42:52,373
Indeed, it is nice.

626
00:42:52,373 --> 00:42:54,652
Understood. You cherish talents.

627
00:42:54,652 --> 00:42:56,252
We trust you.

628
00:42:56,252 --> 00:42:57,072
Yes.

629
00:42:59,853 --> 00:43:00,853
Eat a shrimp.

630
00:43:00,853 --> 00:43:01,572
I cooked one for you.

631
00:43:01,572 --> 00:43:03,053
I forgot about it.

632
00:43:03,053 --> 00:43:04,013
Put it in.

633
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:17,132
Jia.

634
00:43:17,132 --> 00:43:19,132
My good cousin, if you came later,

635
00:43:19,132 --> 00:43:20,732
I'd get roasted by my buddies.

636
00:43:22,413 --> 00:43:24,612
I knew you weren't going
on a blind date.

637
00:43:24,612 --> 00:43:25,493
Team battle.

638
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,053
(Wangjia Supermarket)

639
00:43:29,053 --> 00:43:29,772
Bye.

640
00:43:29,772 --> 00:43:30,533
Bye.

641
00:43:37,732 --> 00:43:38,413
Hello.

642
00:43:39,772 --> 00:43:43,172
Hello, I am Gu Sheng.
You can call me Sheng.

643
00:43:43,172 --> 00:43:44,933
I know you, Gu Jia's cousin.

644
00:43:44,933 --> 00:43:46,212
My name is Dong Yiru.

645
00:43:46,212 --> 00:43:48,053
Today is my first day at work here.

646
00:43:48,053 --> 00:43:51,453
If there's anything I fall short on,
please point it out.

647
00:43:51,453 --> 00:43:53,772
No, it's quite good.

648
00:43:53,772 --> 00:43:56,212
I'll get back to work then.

649
00:43:56,212 --> 00:43:57,572
Alright, thank you.

650
00:43:57,572 --> 00:43:58,933
Don't. It's my job.

651
00:44:17,933 --> 00:44:19,092
Did you check Weibo?

652
00:44:20,813 --> 00:44:23,572
I am about to cry. Do you know that?

653
00:44:23,572 --> 00:44:25,292
My idol just revealed on Weibo

00:44:25,292 --> 00:44:27,612
