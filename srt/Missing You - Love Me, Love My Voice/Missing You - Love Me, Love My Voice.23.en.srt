25
00:01:43,376 --> 00:01:45,072
(Don't worry. I'm here.)

26
00:02:03,684 --> 00:02:06,964
I wanted to have oden.

27
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:10,964
But there wasn't too much left.

28
00:02:12,204 --> 00:02:16,244
I'm not full with the small portion of
river snails rice noodles just now.

29
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,443
I was in a hurry to come here.
I didn't eat much either.

30
00:02:21,484 --> 00:02:21,843
I'm okay.

31
00:02:26,684 --> 00:02:27,524
Are you hungry?

32
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:34,323
How about

33
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:36,763
filling our stomachs first?

34
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:38,804
Do you have a rice cooker?

35
00:02:40,404 --> 00:02:41,603
You want to cook?

36
00:02:42,644 --> 00:02:46,684
We have the stuff right here. The soup.
It's easy if you want to eat something.

37
00:02:46,684 --> 00:02:47,883
Yes. I'll get it.

38
00:02:58,003 --> 00:03:00,003
- Is this okay?
- Yes.

39
00:03:01,003 --> 00:03:04,964
- Hop pot noodles or vermicelli?
- Noodles. It can absorb the soup.

40
00:03:04,964 --> 00:03:06,323
Okay. Let's go.

41
00:03:12,323 --> 00:03:14,684
The rain eased off a little, right?

42
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:17,883
Let's see.

43
00:03:20,684 --> 00:03:22,843
It smells so good.

44
00:03:32,323 --> 00:03:36,443
- So many hearts.
- Yes. So many.

45
00:03:41,524 --> 00:03:42,124
Draw it again.

46
00:03:44,084 --> 00:03:45,644
Okay. It's done.

47
00:03:48,084 --> 00:03:48,883
Give me this.

48
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:57,364
It looks so good
with your casual cooking.

49
00:03:58,003 --> 00:04:03,883
Let's open a small restaurant.
A small one with several tables.

50
00:04:04,204 --> 00:04:08,124
I can assure you they have to wait
for a few months to reserve online.

51
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:10,124
Okay. You can be the lady boss.

52
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:19,643
Try this.

53
00:04:26,364 --> 00:04:26,963
This is for you.

54
00:04:33,164 --> 00:04:35,804
- Is it good?
- So good!

55
00:04:41,963 --> 00:04:44,844
- Okay, enough. I can't eat them all.
- Give me if you can't eat.

56
00:04:59,244 --> 00:05:00,484
This helps digestion.

57
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:02,403
Feel free to eat.

58
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:10,883
It's good indeed.

59
00:05:14,604 --> 00:05:17,844
This meatball is so good.
I'll let my mother buy more.

60
00:05:20,924 --> 00:05:23,376
There's one here. The last one.
You can taste it.

61
00:05:24,403 --> 00:05:26,484
You like it. You can eat it.

62
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,804
Let's eat together.

63
00:05:31,443 --> 00:05:33,804
Stop. Don't give me. Eat.

64
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:40,563
It's hot.

65
00:05:43,523 --> 00:05:47,472
That's right. We have plenty
in the freezer. Anything you want.

66
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:51,284
Help yourself. It's my place.
I can afford it.

67
00:05:51,804 --> 00:05:53,244
- Okay. Eat.
- Right.

68
00:06:11,563 --> 00:06:15,403
(Bad guy, how dare you
infiltrated into the demon world again?)

69
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:20,044
(You had some guts to break into
the forbidden area of Yanbo.)

70
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:23,963
(How did you sneak in?)

71
00:06:25,164 --> 00:06:26,284
(You are threatening me?)

72
00:06:27,364 --> 00:06:28,323
Go have some sleep.

73
00:06:29,643 --> 00:06:31,963
- I really have to get some sleep.
- Go.

74
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:36,604
Take your time.

75
00:07:10,672 --> 00:07:12,176
(Juemei Shayi, My Chat Room)

76
00:07:14,403 --> 00:07:16,464
- Is it still raining?
- It's raining here.

77
00:07:16,464 --> 00:07:17,284
I'll go to Suzhou tomorrow.

78
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:21,844
We have no class tomorrow.
But the school wants us to stay home.

79
00:07:22,003 --> 00:07:24,924
- Me too, but I board at the school.
- (Geng Xiaoxing.)

80
00:07:25,323 --> 00:07:27,244
I live near the school. I'm at home.

81
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:31,284
We can chat longer today.
I can't sleep with the thunder.

82
00:07:31,724 --> 00:07:35,844
Right. And there's no class tomorrow.
We can chat all night.

83
00:07:35,924 --> 00:07:38,763
- (I heard it wrong.)
- Chen, you are a fan of Perfect Voice.

84
00:07:39,003 --> 00:07:41,244
You must know a lot. Where were we?

85
00:07:42,523 --> 00:07:46,244
Juemei. When I was in dubbing circle,
he was popular.

86
00:07:46,604 --> 00:07:50,364
Now there are new voice actors. Current
famous actors are all unknown to me.

87
00:07:50,443 --> 00:07:53,003
But Perfect Voice is
still invincible in the circle.

88
00:07:53,963 --> 00:08:00,244
- Will we be heard by them?
- I hope they can join us.

89
00:08:02,403 --> 00:08:08,804
- They should sleep by now.
- It's fine. We can still talk.

90
00:08:08,924 --> 00:08:13,763
- Chen, you go on.
- (It should be Geng Xiaoxing. Which one?)

91
00:08:13,804 --> 00:08:16,824
I remember the dubbing actors
of Perfect Voice were scattered.

92
00:08:16,824 --> 00:08:19,844
Then the main dubbing actors
moved to the same place.

93
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:25,164
Yes, a main actor talked about this
at one of their anniversaries.

94
00:08:25,403 --> 00:08:31,044
- It was a Golden Age with Top Three.
- It's a pity that I've never seen it.

95
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:33,724
It's this one.

96
00:08:34,763 --> 00:08:38,043
Miss, you must be a new one.
You've missed a lot.

97
00:08:40,124 --> 00:08:45,324
- Have you heard about Juemei's scandal?
- He has a scandal?

98
00:08:45,564 --> 00:08:47,920
Who? Juemei? No way.

99
00:08:48,432 --> 00:08:49,584
He loves to make jokes

100
00:08:49,584 --> 00:08:51,923
but never talks with anyone
except posting ads on Weibo.

101
00:08:52,204 --> 00:08:54,523
I've never seen a real couple.

102
00:08:55,283 --> 00:08:57,683
But I like him with Doudoubing.

103
00:08:58,124 --> 00:08:59,824
A leader and a vice leader.

104
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:01,763
They've known each other
since young and fought together.

105
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:05,763
Me too. They fit so much.

106
00:09:05,763 --> 00:09:10,923
I'm already picturing it.
Their voices also fit.

107
00:09:10,923 --> 00:09:13,763
- (I don't think they fit.)
- Why are you typing?

108
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:19,523
- (My headset is broken. I'm on computer.)
- Then type.

109
00:09:20,043 --> 00:09:22,564
How does it feel with only you
typing on the screen?

110
00:09:23,043 --> 00:09:26,204
I think Feng Yasong has many partners.

111
00:09:26,444 --> 00:09:30,003
He's easy-matching.
He goes well with anyone.

112
00:09:31,124 --> 00:09:34,523
I like Feng Yasong. He's a doctor.
I like someone in a white gown.

113
00:09:34,883 --> 00:09:37,604
- Me too. I liked his voice at first.
- He has many fans.

114
00:09:37,763 --> 00:09:40,204
And I liked him better
when I knew he is a doctor.

115
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:44,763
In regular shows, and at
the anniversary in Yangshuo,

116
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:48,244
he kept helping newcomers proofread
manuscripts backstage. He's kind.

117
00:09:48,683 --> 00:09:51,803
He cures people as a doctor
and helps the new as a dubbing actor.

118
00:09:51,803 --> 00:09:55,763
- He's such a perfect youth. I love him.
- No way.

119
00:09:57,043 --> 00:10:00,484
- He is a good person, and so handsome.
- Feng Yasong.

120
00:10:01,084 --> 00:10:07,683
- A perfect man in the Perfect Voice.
- (He seems to have a girlfriend.)

121
00:10:09,283 --> 00:10:11,084
Who is it?

122
00:10:13,043 --> 00:10:16,124
It's such a big news. Tell us about it.

123
00:10:17,244 --> 00:10:19,283
(It's just a rumor.
I don't know if it's real.)

124
00:10:24,204 --> 00:10:26,204
Let me clarify. That's not true.

125
00:10:27,683 --> 00:10:29,776
- That's actually him.

126
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:31,568
- I knew someone's listening.
- No way.

127
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,643
Is it Feng Yasong?

128
00:10:35,763 --> 00:10:40,364
Yes. It's me. Pretend I'm not here.
You can continue. Anything is fine.

129
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:42,643
I'm just saying I'm single.

130
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,403
Where did you hear it from,
that typing guy?

131
00:10:47,403 --> 00:10:50,003
Don't disgrace my idol.

132
00:10:50,844 --> 00:10:54,288
- You bad guy.
- What else can you say with him here?

133
00:10:56,112 --> 00:11:01,043
(You told Juemei on one of anniversaries.
I'm not lying.)

134
00:11:02,604 --> 00:11:03,803
Juemei?

135
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:06,803
Feng Yasong told Juemei about it.

136
00:11:07,923 --> 00:11:08,883
How did you know this?

137
00:11:10,763 --> 00:11:12,883
Mr. Feng, are you still there?

138
00:11:14,403 --> 00:11:16,084
Say something.

139
00:11:17,084 --> 00:11:20,244
- Really? I don't remember I said this.
- He's serious.

140
00:11:20,564 --> 00:11:23,724
Juemei must have made it up
or remembered it wrong.

141
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,604
(He said that.)

142
00:11:26,643 --> 00:11:30,403
I don't remember. That's not true.
I have to work overtime.

143
00:11:31,003 --> 00:11:37,003
- Mr. Feng, don't go. Let's talk.
- Don't go. It's rare to see you.

144
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,163
It's clean. I'll put it there.

145
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,003
It's almost 4 AM.

146
00:11:52,724 --> 00:11:53,564
Shall we get some sleep?

147
00:11:55,003 --> 00:11:56,523
I'll just go to work from here.

148
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:01,803
It's convenient to live here.
We can come more often.

149
00:12:01,964 --> 00:12:04,003
You can go to work by crossing the road.

150
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:09,043
I'm fine. It's the same as
sleeping in the hospital.

151
00:12:10,244 --> 00:12:15,124
Never mind. We have our homes.
We don't even have a bed here.

152
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:19,043
My father or my brother
sometimes sleeps here.

153
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:23,724
If it's too late after checking
and stacking, they would sleep here.

154
00:12:24,084 --> 00:12:26,244
So it's a single bed.

155
00:12:28,003 --> 00:12:29,484
Your father works so hard.

156
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:34,163
The bed was here before the decoration.
And we didn't want to throw it.

157
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:38,883
It's a bit small,

158
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:42,964
but I think we can get by with it.

159
00:12:45,084 --> 00:12:48,444
How? It's smaller than a single bed.

160
00:12:58,763 --> 00:12:59,604
What happened?

161
00:13:06,883 --> 00:13:08,403
It's okay. I'm here.

162
00:13:14,844 --> 00:13:17,043
The electricity is off?

163
00:13:21,364 --> 00:13:23,643
But the lights across the street are on.

164
00:13:25,364 --> 00:13:28,964
So something is wrong with wires here.
Let's find someone tomorrow.

165
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:36,163
It's not okay to stay here
without electricity.

166
00:13:38,324 --> 00:13:39,923
How about going to the hospital with me?

167
00:13:41,324 --> 00:13:43,523
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

168
00:13:44,643 --> 00:13:47,803
The rain eased now. And the beds
in the duty room are all available.

169
00:13:48,364 --> 00:13:49,844
It's a special occasion. It's okay.

170
00:13:51,604 --> 00:13:52,163
Alright.

171
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:58,403
Mr. Mo, thank you for having a feast
with me and inviting me to the hospital.

172
00:13:59,484 --> 00:14:02,364
In return, I'll get you some food.

173
00:14:12,124 --> 00:14:12,923
Enough, enough.

174
00:14:13,403 --> 00:14:16,643
What will you say to your mother if she
asks you why the supermarket is empty?

175
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:20,683
Every time I go to my friend's,
she would stuff me with many snacks.

176
00:14:20,844 --> 00:14:22,244
She likes to see people eating.

177
00:14:22,484 --> 00:14:24,924
The snacks for the recording studio
last time were given by her.

178
00:14:24,924 --> 00:14:25,683
It's really enough.

179
00:14:27,364 --> 00:14:29,683
Right, we have to put this bed away.

180
00:14:29,883 --> 00:14:33,283
Or she will think someone sneaked in
and slept here.

181
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:35,003
Okay. Let me put it away.

182
00:14:51,763 --> 00:14:52,484
Dr. Mo,

183
00:14:53,403 --> 00:14:57,163
your shift is at the branch hospital.
Why are you here since it's late?

184
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:58,364
Yes. I came back.

185
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,844
Why don't you go back home
with such heavy rain?

186
00:15:03,124 --> 00:15:05,763
I passed here. My house is too far away.
It's not safe to drive now.

187
00:15:08,163 --> 00:15:08,604
Here.

188
00:15:22,364 --> 00:15:23,403
This is my duty room.

189
00:15:27,043 --> 00:15:27,920
Feel free to take a look.

190
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:34,604
I went to my grandpa's office
when I was young.

191
00:15:35,604 --> 00:15:39,883
It's my first time to come to
a duty room of doctors since I grew up.

192
00:15:45,003 --> 00:15:47,124
Do you sleep here
when working overnight?

193
00:15:48,444 --> 00:15:50,794
This is my bed.
I will wash and sleep here

194
00:15:50,794 --> 00:15:53,204
after surgeries
if I'm too tired to go home.

195
00:15:53,763 --> 00:15:55,844
If it's too late in the recording
studio, I'll sleep there.

196
00:16:00,204 --> 00:16:01,574
You've been staying up all night.

197
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:04,043
How about having sleep here?
I'll go to the office next door.

198
00:16:05,204 --> 00:16:07,484
It'd be awkward if someone got in.

199
00:16:08,604 --> 00:16:09,284
Lock the door.

200
00:16:09,648 --> 00:16:11,508
I'll call you
when I'm back tomorrow morning,

201
00:16:11,508 --> 00:16:12,604
then you can open the door.

202
00:16:13,923 --> 00:16:14,403
Okay.

203
00:16:27,763 --> 00:16:30,964
I'll go. Lock the door.
Wait for my call.

204
00:16:34,643 --> 00:16:35,643
- Bye.
- Bye.

205
00:18:29,203 --> 00:18:30,203
I was scared.

206
00:18:40,804 --> 00:18:41,804
You haven't left?

207
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:54,243
(Yes. I'm working overnight.)

208
00:18:56,564 --> 00:18:57,483
You...

209
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:04,564
(What do you want to ask?)

210
00:19:07,844 --> 00:19:11,243
You know so many rumors about
Perfect Voice. You must be a loyal fan.

211
00:19:14,284 --> 00:19:19,364
(Yes. Since their foundation. No,
specifically, before their foundation,)

212
00:19:19,564 --> 00:19:23,524
(when Qiang Qingci and Juemei Shayi were
slightly famous, I was there.)

213
00:19:25,643 --> 00:19:26,163
I see.

214
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,643
(You are a student?
I heard you talking about university.)

215
00:19:48,524 --> 00:19:49,084
Yes.

216
00:19:53,243 --> 00:19:55,844
(It's so late. Aren't you afraid
of disturbing your roommates?)

217
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:04,883
She's watching a film. She's afraid,
so she asked me to stay awake with her.

218
00:20:07,004 --> 00:20:08,403
But I'm too sleepy.

219
00:20:10,203 --> 00:20:11,804
I'll go to sleep. Bye.

220
00:20:28,124 --> 00:20:33,403
With the thunder and the rain,
it's a perfect night to watch this film.

221
00:20:34,044 --> 00:20:38,084
It would be more perfect
if you don't let me stay awake with you.

222
00:20:38,483 --> 00:20:42,124
- I thought you were asleep.
- I promised you. I have to keep it.

223
00:20:42,923 --> 00:20:45,124
You are so nice.

224
00:20:45,804 --> 00:20:52,804
- You've been chatting with others?
- Mostly listen to them.

225
00:20:53,203 --> 00:20:56,524
They were talking about rumors
in a chat room. I thought it was fun.

226
00:20:56,804 --> 00:20:58,923
Why didn't you call me
to hear the rumors?

227
00:20:59,044 --> 00:21:03,243
- You were watching the film.
- What's new? Tell me.

228
00:21:04,804 --> 00:21:09,604
- Feng Yasong has a girlfriend.
- No way. He's known for being single.

229
00:21:09,764 --> 00:21:12,683
He denied it, but he left after a while.

230
00:21:13,443 --> 00:21:14,604
He was online?

231
00:21:16,723 --> 00:21:19,163
- In the chat room?
- Yes.

232
00:21:20,124 --> 00:21:24,084
He listened to his fans chatting in his
own chat room. Was it fun?

233
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:25,963
A strange habit.

234
00:21:27,324 --> 00:21:32,124
Why did I watch the film? I'll wait
for him in the chat room tomorrow.

235
00:21:32,364 --> 00:21:36,044
- Alright. Go to sleep. Good night.
- I'll wash and sleep too.

236
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:37,163
- Good night.
- Good night.

237
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,084
(- Geng Xiaoxing?
- Did you make it home safely?)

238
00:22:00,643 --> 00:22:02,284
No way.

239
00:22:06,963 --> 00:22:09,844
(Reply tomorrow if you are asleep.)

240
00:22:18,124 --> 00:22:22,643
(If I can reply when I'm asleep,
I must have been woken up by you.)

241
00:22:22,764 --> 00:22:27,643
(But then I see you asking me to reply
tomorrow. How do you think I would feel?)

242
00:22:28,324 --> 00:22:29,203
(It's my fault.)

243
00:22:32,683 --> 00:22:33,483
(How to make up for me?)

244
00:22:35,084 --> 00:22:35,804
(Say it.)

245
00:22:46,284 --> 00:22:47,604
(Record an audio for me.)

246
00:22:55,483 --> 00:22:57,723
(You are a dubbing actor.)

247
00:23:01,403 --> 00:23:04,324
(Record counting sheep.
It's the simplest.)

248
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:12,683
(How?)

249
00:23:25,364 --> 00:23:26,804
Listen. I'll teach you.

250
00:23:40,284 --> 00:23:41,804
Listen. I'll teach you.

251
00:23:43,804 --> 00:23:50,364
One sheep, two sheep, three sheep,
four sheep, five sheep,

252
00:23:50,844 --> 00:23:57,403
six sheep, seven sheep, eight sheep,
nine sheep, ten sheep,

253
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:03,243
11 sheep, 12 sheep, 13 sheep, 14 sheep,

254
00:24:03,883 --> 00:24:09,324
15 sheep, 16 sheep, 17 sheep, 18 sheep,

255
00:24:09,923 --> 00:24:14,043
19 sheep, 20 sheep, 21 sheep,

256
00:24:14,043 --> 00:24:18,524
22 sheep, 23 sheep, 24 sheep,

257
00:24:19,203 --> 00:24:23,284
25 sheep, 26 sheep, 27 sheep,

258
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:27,844
28 sheep, 29 sheep, 30 sheep.

259
00:24:43,216 --> 00:24:47,728
(First People's Hospital)

260
00:24:53,712 --> 00:24:56,048
(Outpatient)

261
00:25:15,643 --> 00:25:17,243
Dr. Mo, Pediatrics wants you.

262
00:25:19,564 --> 00:25:19,923
Okay.

263
00:25:22,804 --> 00:25:24,403
Dr. Zhang, don't get in the duty room.

264
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:27,494
Dr. Mo brought his girlfriend here
due to the typhoon yesterday.

265
00:25:27,494 --> 00:25:28,364
She's still asleep.

266
00:25:36,604 --> 00:25:37,004
Morning.

267
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:39,403
Morning.

268
00:25:40,284 --> 00:25:42,364
Dr. Mo was called away.
He'll be back soon.

269
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:44,804
Okay.

270
00:25:46,364 --> 00:25:47,564
You are sleeping?

271
00:25:49,324 --> 00:25:52,432
You can go on. I have to make rounds.

272
00:25:53,443 --> 00:25:54,403
I'll close the door for you.

273
00:25:59,764 --> 00:26:00,804
Lock the door.

274
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,096
(Mo Qingcheng)

275
00:26:26,564 --> 00:26:27,124
Hello.

276
00:26:28,604 --> 00:26:31,124
I thought you asked me
to open the door just now.

277
00:26:31,844 --> 00:26:35,203
I'm in Pediatrics. I was called here
temporarily. Get more sleep.

278
00:26:36,683 --> 00:26:37,124
Okay.

279
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,203
That was awkward.

280
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,524
It's a good day.

281
00:26:52,524 --> 00:26:53,643
Morning, Dr. Mo.

282
00:26:56,923 --> 00:26:57,808
Dr. Mo,

283
00:27:00,524 --> 00:27:04,243
your girlfriend was awake and looked
for you. I told her you'll be back soon.

284
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:05,564
Thank you.

285
00:27:29,723 --> 00:27:30,284
Hello.

286
00:27:31,403 --> 00:27:33,963
- Is it you knocking at the door?
- Yes.

287
00:27:35,203 --> 00:27:35,844
Coming.

288
00:27:52,683 --> 00:27:53,524
How did you sleep?

289
00:27:54,723 --> 00:27:58,163
Great. Your bed is so comfortable
to sleep.

290
00:27:59,963 --> 00:28:04,643
It's 6 AM. My shift hasn't begun.
Let's get some sleep.

291
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:10,883
Let's go.

292
00:28:28,324 --> 00:28:33,243
(It's the duty room at the hospital.
He probably wants to get some sleep.)

293
00:28:37,604 --> 00:28:40,804
It's the duty room at the hospital.
I just want some sleep.

294
00:28:42,324 --> 00:28:44,604
I'll sleep here. You can go on.

295
00:28:48,483 --> 00:28:50,683
Do you need an alarm?

296
00:28:52,683 --> 00:28:53,364
I already had one.

297
00:28:54,683 --> 00:28:55,163
Let's sleep.

298
00:28:56,643 --> 00:28:57,203
I'm so sleepy.

299
00:29:12,124 --> 00:29:12,880
Morning.

300
00:30:14,844 --> 00:30:15,524
Who is it?

301
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:17,524
It's me.

302
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:20,604
What's the matter? I'm sleeping.

303
00:30:22,643 --> 00:30:23,883
Let's discuss the case.

304
00:30:27,124 --> 00:30:27,723
Coming.

305
00:30:33,044 --> 00:30:37,723
I'll go home first. You can come and
find me when you are done with this.

306
00:30:38,923 --> 00:30:39,443
Okay.

307
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:41,564
I'll open the door.

308
00:30:48,443 --> 00:30:48,844
This...

309
00:30:53,963 --> 00:30:58,844
- Sorry. I forgot you were here.
- It's alright. You can go on.

310
00:30:59,604 --> 00:31:00,004
I...

311
00:31:01,243 --> 00:31:01,963
- Bye.
- Bye.

312
00:31:08,203 --> 00:31:09,284
She's gone. Have a seat.

313
00:31:23,243 --> 00:31:23,888
Sheng.

314
00:31:24,944 --> 00:31:29,044
- Grandpa, why are you here alone?
- Come. Have a seat.

315
00:31:29,203 --> 00:31:30,963
It's dangerous to come upstairs.
Don't come alone.

316
00:31:30,963 --> 00:31:32,243
You can tell me if you need anything.

317
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:37,403
- I just want to take a sunbath.
- Okay. Do whatever you like.

318
00:31:40,764 --> 00:31:44,683
- Were you frightened by the storm?
- No.

319
00:31:45,844 --> 00:31:46,364
Right.

320
00:31:47,524 --> 00:31:49,844
You won't be afraid
with someone by your side.

321
00:31:51,524 --> 00:31:51,923
Right.

322
00:31:54,044 --> 00:31:58,284
Your mother asked your father to pick
you up from your schoolmate's house.

323
00:31:59,124 --> 00:32:01,443
- Then?
- Then I told her

324
00:32:01,764 --> 00:32:03,963
you are mature enough
to keep yourself from the storm.

325
00:32:04,643 --> 00:32:10,524
And you should know better if she
doesn't want you to go, right?

326
00:32:16,124 --> 00:32:20,564
Sheng,
are you getting along well with Dr. Mo?

327
00:32:21,923 --> 00:32:27,804
- Yes. Very well.
- Okay. Let me meet him someday.

328
00:32:28,524 --> 00:32:32,844
I have sharp eyes though they are small.
I know about a doctor.

329
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:36,764
I can rest assured when you do,
and we can all rest assured.

330
00:32:38,764 --> 00:32:41,443
- No rush. We have plenty of time.
- Okay.

331
00:32:42,443 --> 00:32:43,324
Okay.

332
00:32:44,203 --> 00:32:45,764
- Sit, grandpa.
- Okay.

333
00:33:01,084 --> 00:33:05,004
- Mr. Feng, when did you come back?
- This morning. I was delayed by storm.

334
00:33:05,243 --> 00:33:08,044
I should have come back last night.
I stayed at the airport the whole night.

335
00:33:09,443 --> 00:33:12,368
The whole night. Then you were bored
and went to the chat room.

336
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:14,324
How did you know?

337
00:33:16,084 --> 00:33:19,324
I- I heard it from others.
It doesn't matter.

338
00:33:23,764 --> 00:33:27,344
- You don't look good. You didn't sleep?
- I don't look good?

339
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,483
Really? Let me see.

340
00:33:31,084 --> 00:33:31,883
It's okay.

341
00:33:33,564 --> 00:33:38,804
- Come. I'll feel your pulse.
- Okay. You haven't felt it for long.

342
00:33:41,564 --> 00:33:44,004
You can apply what you learned.

343
00:33:44,683 --> 00:33:48,243
Why didn't you study Chinese medicine
in college? It's popular now.

344
00:33:48,364 --> 00:33:49,324
Don't disturb me.

345
00:33:54,764 --> 00:34:00,163
What's wrong? I was caught in the rain
last night and now I have a sore throat.

346
00:34:06,604 --> 00:34:08,484
What's wrong?

347
00:34:09,884 --> 00:34:10,884
Tell me.

348
00:34:14,363 --> 00:34:15,484
You are pregnant.

349
00:34:17,283 --> 00:34:18,964
Nonsense.

350
00:34:19,304 --> 00:34:21,136
You know you were caught in the rain
and had a sore throat.

351
00:34:21,136 --> 00:34:22,643
Why don't you take medicine?

352
00:34:23,124 --> 00:34:26,404
- How would you dub later?
- I'm finding it.

353
00:34:38,323 --> 00:34:43,564
But your eyes are bright and there is
light on your forehead. A lucky sign.

354
00:34:44,363 --> 00:34:50,124
- Is there progress in your love life?
- Why is it so hard to talk to you?

355
00:34:51,564 --> 00:34:53,454
It's not hard. You've become stupid.

356
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,408
The wise never fall in love.

357
00:34:55,408 --> 00:34:57,484
You and Qiang Qingci
could compete with me before.

358
00:34:57,604 --> 00:35:00,803
Now you all fell in love. Of course,
you are not as smart as me.

359
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:04,484
Where do you learn that from?

360
00:35:06,763 --> 00:35:10,444
I'll take a shower and do the laundry.
Do you have some clothes to wash?

361
00:35:11,044 --> 00:35:14,163
Why do you have to
wash your clothes with mine?

362
00:35:14,243 --> 00:35:18,763
To save money. It will charge
the same water and electricity fees.

363
00:35:18,763 --> 00:35:20,124
It's better to wash them together.

364
00:35:21,363 --> 00:35:24,604
- Okay. You are good at saving money.
- Good at living.

365
00:35:24,763 --> 00:35:28,124
Here's the milk tea for the best saver
of Tianzi No. 1 Recording Studio.

366
00:35:28,803 --> 00:35:32,884
- Thanks. How much?
- Free. Your style. Two for one.

367
00:35:33,124 --> 00:35:36,163
I'll use the milk tea as wine
to welcome you back.

368
00:35:37,484 --> 00:35:41,004
- Where's mine?
- You have your medicine.

369
00:35:45,363 --> 00:35:49,444
Are you jealous? My friendship with Dou
is beyond yours.

370
00:35:50,163 --> 00:35:52,444
Yes. I'm jealous. Beyond mine.

371
00:35:52,604 --> 00:35:55,120
Cheers for my friendship with Dou.

372
00:35:56,474 --> 00:35:57,964
- Cheers.
- Okay.

373
00:36:06,924 --> 00:36:12,484
Sheng, I like to eat a pomegranate.
It's just quite difficult to peel.

374
00:36:12,524 --> 00:36:15,604
- I'll peel more for you.
- Okay.

375
00:36:18,323 --> 00:36:19,163
(See at the lane entrance.)

376
00:36:21,283 --> 00:36:24,444
- Grandpa, I have to go out for a while.
- Okay.

377
00:36:25,004 --> 00:36:25,924
- Gu Jia.
- What's wrong?

378
00:36:25,924 --> 00:36:28,444
Grandpa wants you
to peel pomegranates for him.

379
00:36:28,444 --> 00:36:30,964
Peel pomegranates?
Then what would you do?

380
00:36:31,484 --> 00:36:34,763
- Grandpa likes it. Peel more for him.
- How could you leave this...

381
00:36:54,404 --> 00:36:56,643
- Where are we going?
- Where do you want to go?

382
00:36:59,163 --> 00:37:01,824
Go to the studio with me if you don't
have any other arrangements.

383
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,484
The sewer was blocked,
so I asked someone to come and fix it.

384
00:37:05,084 --> 00:37:05,723
Okay.

385
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,208
But you've been working all day.

386
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:11,243
And I just ask you to do this with me.
I feel bad.

387
00:37:11,404 --> 00:37:17,484
I just want to see you. It doesn't
matter where to go or what to do.

388
00:37:20,444 --> 00:37:21,044
Let's go.

389
00:37:38,283 --> 00:37:40,564
It feels like taking you home.

390
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:45,484
Off Key.

391
00:37:47,803 --> 00:37:49,933
I thought I was in the wrong place.

392
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:52,004
You thought you were still
in Tianzi No. 1 Recording Studio?

393
00:37:52,004 --> 00:37:57,924
Yes. I didn't see Mr. Mo at Tianzi No.1,
but I see him here.

394
00:37:58,723 --> 00:38:01,203
Guai, your guest of honor is here.

395
00:38:02,404 --> 00:38:03,604
- Come.
- Who is it?

396
00:38:06,643 --> 00:38:12,283
I didn't know you and I thought
you were our senior last time.

397
00:38:12,484 --> 00:38:15,243
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

398
00:38:15,404 --> 00:38:18,004
- Speak normally.
- I am doing that.

399
00:38:18,723 --> 00:38:21,444
He's a senior. I have to respect him.

400
00:38:22,203 --> 00:38:25,444
- You don't have to be so polite to me.
- Right.

401
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:26,480
Mr. Mo, have a seat.

402
00:38:27,524 --> 00:38:29,044
I was sleeping.
I forgot to clean this up.

403
00:38:30,243 --> 00:38:31,643
Mr. Mo, sit here.

404
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:52,763
Why are you so serious and tense?
I don't dare bring him here anymore.

405
00:38:53,776 --> 00:38:57,124
Mr. Qiang is here as a guest.
We have to be polite.

406
00:38:58,763 --> 00:39:03,163
But I'm on your side.
I have to be polite as well.

407
00:39:09,283 --> 00:39:10,004
Okay.

408
00:39:11,803 --> 00:39:14,404
Then I should say,

409
00:39:15,843 --> 00:39:18,884
"Relax, I'll be good to Sheng."

410
00:39:20,964 --> 00:39:23,444
- You are joking again.
- It's not a joke.

411
00:39:24,163 --> 00:39:28,924
It's definitely not a joke. I saw
sincerity in Mr. Qiang's eyes.

412
00:39:30,683 --> 00:39:34,044
I wanted to say it last time
I went here. It's a good place.

413
00:39:34,964 --> 00:39:37,203
It's bigger than the first studio
of Perfect Voice.

414
00:39:37,323 --> 00:39:41,363
Our leader found this place.
She works at a nearby beauty salon.

415
00:39:41,564 --> 00:39:43,856
This used to be
children's art classroom.

416
00:39:43,856 --> 00:39:45,723
The teacher happens to be
a guest of our leader.

417
00:39:45,843 --> 00:39:49,203
- He moved out and we rented this place.
- I see.

418
00:39:51,243 --> 00:39:56,524
I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Guai,
an English teacher in a primary school.

419
00:39:57,363 --> 00:39:59,856
I'm Off Key, an official employee
of Perfect Voice.

420
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:02,604
You are so proud.

421
00:40:02,803 --> 00:40:04,243
I'm just being honest.

422
00:40:04,524 --> 00:40:08,924
Senior, what do you do?
It's okay if you don't want to say.

423
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:10,884
It's okay. I'm a doctor.

424
00:40:12,564 --> 00:40:15,784
A lot of rumors
on the internet didn't say it.

425
00:40:15,784 --> 00:40:18,323
Feng Yasong and you are both doctors.

426
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,243
Haven't you told her?

427
00:40:21,404 --> 00:40:22,672
There are confidentiality agreements.

428
00:40:22,672 --> 00:40:26,363
Doudou said we can't disclose
personal life of anyone in Perfect Voice.

429
00:40:26,803 --> 00:40:29,444
- She never asked.
- Right.

430
00:40:30,044 --> 00:40:33,774
I know you have privacy concerns,
so I never asked Sheng.

431
00:40:33,774 --> 00:40:36,323
You are good friends. That's different.

432
00:40:38,524 --> 00:40:43,124
I haven't poured you some water.
Tea or drinks?

433
00:40:43,243 --> 00:40:45,643
- We have coke, ice tea...
- It's okay. I can help myself.

434
00:40:45,884 --> 00:40:49,203
- Is it okay? I'll go to the kitchen.
- You went there before.

435
00:40:50,163 --> 00:40:50,564
Okay.

436
00:40:51,044 --> 00:40:54,024
I'm on their side today.
I won't be with you.

437
00:40:54,024 --> 00:40:54,524
Right.

438
00:40:55,843 --> 00:40:58,768
He's so nice.

439
00:40:58,768 --> 00:41:01,843
Yes. I'll show you around
Perfect Voice someday.

440
00:41:02,004 --> 00:41:06,484
They are all seniors in the industry
and all of them are kind.

441
00:41:07,243 --> 00:41:08,463
You just show off.

442
00:41:08,463 --> 00:41:11,604
I'm not. Sheng should be
the one showing off. Right?

443
00:41:14,044 --> 00:41:16,604
It's 5 PM.
I have to work this afternoon.

444
00:41:18,444 --> 00:41:22,243
- Mr. Mo, I'll go back to Tianzi No. 1.
- You are leaving?

445
00:41:23,884 --> 00:41:25,044
- Bye.
- Bye.

446
00:41:25,203 --> 00:41:25,924
Bye.

447
00:41:28,564 --> 00:41:30,084
Drink orange juice.

448
00:41:41,843 --> 00:41:47,243
- I... I have a class later.
- You said you didn't have any classes.

449
00:41:49,488 --> 00:41:51,312
I ch-changed.

450
00:41:51,312 --> 00:41:52,848
It's not our first meeting.

451
00:41:52,848 --> 00:41:54,153
You don't have to
find an excuse to leave.

452
00:41:54,256 --> 00:41:56,404
- Yes. Sit.
- Okay.

453
00:41:57,444 --> 00:41:59,763
It's your place. I'm just a guest.

454
00:42:01,763 --> 00:42:03,163
Ri-right.

455
00:42:07,444 --> 00:42:07,803
Let me.

456
00:42:11,004 --> 00:42:11,604
Coming.

457
00:42:12,484 --> 00:42:16,964
- Hello.
- Hello, I am here to repair the sewer.

458
00:42:16,964 --> 00:42:19,404
Yes. The drain next to the washing
machine in the kitchen is broken.

459
00:42:19,564 --> 00:42:21,444
- Okay...
- This way.

460
00:42:24,564 --> 00:42:25,843
Sit. I'll watch.

461
00:42:26,323 --> 00:42:27,763
- Where? This one?
- This.

462
00:42:27,763 --> 00:42:28,363
Okay.

463
00:42:28,683 --> 00:42:33,243
He's not arrogant,
and he's a reliable good man.

464
00:42:40,363 --> 00:42:43,604
- Doudou, there is toast.
- Thank you.

465
00:42:48,723 --> 00:42:49,884
It smells so good.

466
00:42:51,604 --> 00:42:56,243
Does Mr. Feng's family need money?
Why does he have to save like this?

467
00:42:56,723 --> 00:42:57,524
You can see.

468
00:42:58,564 --> 00:43:01,484
He has to spend
less than 15 yuan on takeout.

469
00:43:01,643 --> 00:43:04,803
And he has to let us throw the empty
bottles in cardboard boxes to sell them.

470
00:43:05,004 --> 00:43:08,404
He has used his phone for five years.
It's always unresponsive.

471
00:43:08,604 --> 00:43:11,294
He used a lot of coupons
when buying things,

472
00:43:11,294 --> 00:43:13,924
but he never hesitated
to treat us to meals.

473
00:43:14,084 --> 00:43:14,964
He doesn't look poor.

474
00:43:16,084 --> 00:43:16,843
He's rich.

475
00:43:17,843 --> 00:43:19,203
He's a famous dubbing actor,

476
00:43:19,203 --> 00:43:21,584
a pediatrician from a tertiary hospital
and he can save.

477
00:43:21,584 --> 00:43:22,843
How could he be poor?

478
00:43:25,044 --> 00:43:30,683
He's saving to get married. I seldom see
someone who could save money like him.

479
00:43:32,283 --> 00:43:38,243
It's his habit. He's generous to
his friends, but he's frugal to himself.

480
00:43:38,643 --> 00:43:39,964
He was like this when he was in school.

481
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:46,363
We were not so familiar at first
and we went to lots of expensive places.

482
00:43:46,564 --> 00:43:48,163
It's rare to get out of school.

483
00:43:48,683 --> 00:43:52,444
He was so generous
when we split the bills.

484
00:43:53,084 --> 00:43:56,176
But then Mr. Mo told me that

485
00:43:56,176 --> 00:43:59,803
he earned his living expenses
by doing temporary jobs.

486
00:43:59,924 --> 00:44:01,604
He's so frugal at usual times.

487
00:44:03,004 --> 00:44:04,004
What a good man.

488
00:44:06,843 --> 00:44:08,560
He's famous and popular,

489
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,283
he has a lot of works
and he never had a scandal.

490
00:44:10,283 --> 00:44:11,484
And he has a good temper.

491
00:44:11,643 --> 00:44:13,124
I've never seen him angry with anyone.

492
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:14,608
He was born with a good temper.

493
00:44:14,608 --> 00:44:17,084
He is more patient
after he became a pediatrician.

494
00:44:20,084 --> 00:44:23,323
What do you think his future wife
will look like?

495
00:44:59,876 --> 00:45:04,864
