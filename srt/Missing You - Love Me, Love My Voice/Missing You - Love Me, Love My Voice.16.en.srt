25
00:01:42,128 --> 00:01:44,815
(Because we met in winter.)

26
00:01:46,276 --> 00:01:49,957
- Hold on tight. There are rapids ahead.
- Okay.

27
00:01:54,996 --> 00:01:55,516
Rapids.

28
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,516
- Coward.
- I've already known!

29
00:02:32,076 --> 00:02:34,076
Oh, my god. This is real.

30
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,504
Sir, can we stay here for a while?

31
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,317
- Sure.
- Thank you.

32
00:03:11,556 --> 00:03:18,176
Anyway, you are the last guests.
No rush. You guys can take your time.

33
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:19,676
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

34
00:03:26,836 --> 00:03:35,317
- Take a good one. Artist vibe.
- I've never had a good one. Let me try.

35
00:03:37,437 --> 00:03:41,917
As one of our Top Three,
pay attention to your image. Okay?

36
00:03:43,636 --> 00:03:47,896
It is required. Only post photos
after my review in the future.

37
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:49,757
Why am I the only one
who has this requirement?

38
00:03:51,116 --> 00:03:53,477
He's taken.
No one cares about him anymore.

39
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:59,796
What? Want to show great swimming skills
to Shengshengman?

40
00:04:02,997 --> 00:04:08,437
Qiang Qingci, don't be good at
everything. Though you're extraordinary.

41
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:17,356
Sir, how's the taste of the restaurant
by the shore?

42
00:04:20,037 --> 00:04:24,757
It's good.
Have you tried the spotted fish hotpot?

43
00:04:24,757 --> 00:04:25,637
- No.
- No.

44
00:04:26,837 --> 00:04:30,032
It's one of our local specialties.
That restaurant has it.

45
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,397
- You want to eat that?
- Yes.

46
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:37,397
Okay, sir. Send them back first,
and then take us to the restaurant.

47
00:04:38,957 --> 00:04:45,917
Okay, don't order too much.
Just try the fish.

48
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:54,597
You can order some vegetables. The chef
can cut the fish very thin. It's great!

49
00:04:54,597 --> 00:04:58,796
Since we are here,
we must try everything in the river.

50
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:07,837
You guys are lucky. The owner isn't
always there. But she opens today.

51
00:05:07,837 --> 00:05:12,056
Last week, she took a week off,
and she might close again tomorrow.

52
00:05:12,056 --> 00:05:14,756
Really? Then we are fortunate.

53
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:24,556
You're deliberately teasing them, right?

54
00:05:26,597 --> 00:05:29,556
- You realized?
- If I can't realize it, I'm dumb.

55
00:05:49,277 --> 00:05:53,817
Doudou, how about you go with us?
The more the merrier.

56
00:05:53,817 --> 00:05:55,637
- Okay, I'll go with you.
- I'll accompany you.

57
00:05:58,397 --> 00:06:02,676
- Okay. Sir, let's go there directly.
- Okay.

58
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:06,996
- Hold on. We are moving now.
- Alright.

59
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,556
- Here we are, guys. This is the place.
- This one.

60
00:06:16,556 --> 00:06:22,196
A must-visit spot for tourists.
Come in and have a look.

61
00:06:24,316 --> 00:06:31,376
Here's my business card. I'm Zhang.
If you take bamboo rafts again, call me.

62
00:06:31,376 --> 00:06:35,317
- And we can go farther next time.
- Alright, thank you.

63
00:06:35,317 --> 00:06:37,968
I am about to rest,
and you bring me guests again?

64
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:43,297
These guests have never tried
local dishes. Please take care of them.

65
00:06:43,297 --> 00:06:46,517
Okay, you're the last guests of the day.
I'll give you a 20 percent discount.

66
00:06:46,517 --> 00:06:47,597
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

67
00:06:47,597 --> 00:06:50,957
- You're welcome. Let's go.
- Thank you. Good work.

68
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:52,436
- Bye.
- Thanks. We'll call you next time.

69
00:06:52,436 --> 00:06:52,996
Thanks.

70
00:06:54,637 --> 00:06:55,157
Come on.

71
00:06:58,116 --> 00:07:00,637
- Come. Sit at this table.
- Thank you.

72
00:07:03,077 --> 00:07:08,617
Do you like the landscape? I was
attracted to it when I first came here.

73
00:07:09,072 --> 00:07:13,296
I thought that, Guilin's landscape
is the best all over the world.

74
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:18,276
- And Yangshuo is even better.
- You're beautiful and sweet.

75
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:21,376
I'll give you
an additional 20 percent off.

76
00:07:21,376 --> 00:07:23,920
- Really?
- And I'll choose the best fish for you.

77
00:07:24,752 --> 00:07:26,737
- Can you cook it here?
- Of course.

78
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:30,596
It's rare to see such a beautiful girl.
Whatever you ask for, I will fulfill.

79
00:07:30,596 --> 00:07:33,277
- I'll let chef prepare it. Wait a bit.
- Thanks, ma'am.

80
00:07:43,277 --> 00:07:44,037
Great cutting skills.

81
00:08:07,397 --> 00:08:12,077
Okay, it's done.
Enjoy your meal. I'm off to have mine.

82
00:08:12,656 --> 00:08:15,797
By the way, this is white pepper powder.

83
00:08:15,797 --> 00:08:20,397
Try the soup first. Add some in it.
I personally enjoy it.

84
00:08:20,397 --> 00:08:21,336
Okay.

85
00:08:21,336 --> 00:08:22,957
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

86
00:08:22,957 --> 00:08:23,477
Thanks.

87
00:08:24,597 --> 00:08:28,917
- Remember, three seconds are enough.
- Get it.

88
00:08:29,392 --> 00:08:33,584
Lucky for you, the owner is a woman.
Otherwise, you might get dumped tonight.

89
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:38,377
Image this, there'll be a sports car
parking outside later.

90
00:08:38,377 --> 00:08:40,397
Let's go back to Yuerong manor.

91
00:08:42,676 --> 00:08:46,997
Having pursuers means she's excellent.

92
00:08:49,316 --> 00:08:51,316
- Thank you.
- Come on, try it.

93
00:08:52,637 --> 00:08:52,997
Here.

94
00:08:56,316 --> 00:08:57,037
It's all worth it.

95
00:08:58,196 --> 00:09:02,397
It's delicious and fresh. Try it.
Oh, add pepper powder.

96
00:09:05,476 --> 00:09:08,237
One, two, three.

97
00:09:15,676 --> 00:09:20,037
- How is it?
- Very fresh and tender.

98
00:09:20,037 --> 00:09:24,656
Your respect to food can satisfy
the chef. Your expressions say it all.

99
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,556
And you gain no weight.
You're a truly blessed foodie.

100
00:09:31,796 --> 00:09:35,877
You're so pretty, Sheng.
There must be many people after you.

101
00:09:47,117 --> 00:09:51,157
- She's afraid you'll get jealous.
- You're going to be sleepless tonight.

102
00:09:54,357 --> 00:09:57,997
Since you pay for the dinner, let me ask
a question that can make you happy.

103
00:09:59,196 --> 00:10:04,357
Sheng, among those who are after you,
isn't Mr. Mo the most handsome one?

104
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:05,744
Of course.

105
00:10:06,956 --> 00:10:10,097
- Of course.
- She's so cute.

106
00:10:10,097 --> 00:10:14,556
I know why the owner likes you.
You're cute. So serious about jokes.

107
00:10:16,956 --> 00:10:19,397
Too many questions.
Why don't you pay for the dinner?

108
00:10:21,476 --> 00:10:23,637
Okay, I'll shut up.

109
00:10:41,836 --> 00:10:47,716
Xiaoxing never dares to sleep alone.
I'm afraid she might be scared.

110
00:10:49,556 --> 00:10:50,076
Okay.

111
00:10:57,397 --> 00:11:00,436
I'll call you later from the balcony.

112
00:11:03,316 --> 00:11:04,877
- Good night.
- Good night.

113
00:11:09,637 --> 00:11:10,196
Bye.

114
00:11:18,076 --> 00:11:18,796
Geng Xiaoxing.

115
00:11:21,316 --> 00:11:21,956
Where is she?

116
00:11:27,997 --> 00:11:32,880
- Where are you?
- Playing mahjong. You sleep first.

117
00:12:23,357 --> 00:12:23,920
Turn around.

118
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:28,880
Why are you out again?

119
00:12:29,936 --> 00:12:36,097
My mahjong-loving friend
was taken away by your colleagues.

120
00:12:36,097 --> 00:12:40,496
I'm afraid she might play all night.

121
00:12:40,496 --> 00:12:45,392
Relax. It's just for fun.
They never gamble money.

122
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:49,836
Even if it's the day after tomorrow,
your friend is safe.

123
00:12:53,157 --> 00:12:57,596
It's late. Do you think alpacas are asleep?

124
00:13:00,517 --> 00:13:03,877
Hard to tell. Let's go and see.
Facts speak louder than guessing.

125
00:13:05,836 --> 00:13:06,316
Let's go.

126
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:19,737
- So many mosquitoes.
- Do you want to go back?

127
00:13:19,737 --> 00:13:24,716
No, it's okay. After all,
there's nobody at the room.

128
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:28,997
- What about you? Want to go back?
- I don't want to go back either.

129
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:35,037
We're rarely free. Plus,
we can't be weaker than them, can we?

130
00:13:37,157 --> 00:13:37,637
Let's go.

131
00:13:41,076 --> 00:13:43,476
Shall we walk until dawn?

132
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:45,877
If you want to.

133
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:52,756
Let me go back to get some food.
Then we can take a stroll.

134
00:13:52,756 --> 00:13:57,237
- It's easier to stay up all night.
- I'm going to gain three pounds, right?

135
00:13:58,596 --> 00:14:02,917
- At least five pounds.
- Then I won't eat tomorrow.

136
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:03,716
Really?

137
00:14:04,997 --> 00:14:08,877
- Pity, there're still many specialties.
- What are they?

138
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,637
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

139
00:14:17,196 --> 00:14:18,117
Alpacas!

140
00:14:23,157 --> 00:14:26,237
They've come out! So cute!

141
00:14:27,476 --> 00:14:30,864
- Be careful. They might bite you.
- Yes, be cautious.

142
00:14:31,632 --> 00:14:33,037
- Do you have any carrots?
- Yes.

143
00:14:34,596 --> 00:14:35,637
- Here, take it.
- Thank you.

144
00:14:44,076 --> 00:14:44,997
I don't dare to.

145
00:14:52,997 --> 00:14:58,917
- How do you know they eat carrots?
- I looked it up in advance.

146
00:14:59,956 --> 00:15:01,836
I'm so touched, Mr. Mo.

147
00:15:06,237 --> 00:15:09,476
- Their colors are different.
- Indeed, they're a pair.

148
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:15,196
- Really? Are you making this up?
- It's true, Ms. Shengshengman.

149
00:15:18,757 --> 00:15:23,316
Since I know they like to eat carrots,
why not learn more about them?

150
00:15:24,517 --> 00:15:28,304
Knowing you were coming to see them,
I couldn't be speechless, could I?

151
00:15:29,392 --> 00:15:32,080
You didn't delve into their histories,
did you?

152
00:15:33,328 --> 00:15:36,880
Not quite.
But I have the basic knowledge.

153
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:42,357
A staff said they also have mini pigs.
But it's too late. They should be asleep now.

154
00:16:06,157 --> 00:16:08,836
- Just go in, miss.
- You scared me!

155
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:14,237
I knew it. You were up to no good
when I was not around. How was the date?

156
00:16:15,436 --> 00:16:17,397
We talked all night.

157
00:16:18,676 --> 00:16:22,636
Unplug the phone.
Don't let reception disturb us again.

158
00:16:22,636 --> 00:16:23,637
Okay.

159
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:34,157
I'm so sleepy, too tired to bathe.
Let's just sleep with the smell.

160
00:16:37,117 --> 00:16:40,757
Then let's just sleep, just like this.

161
00:16:42,956 --> 00:16:47,796
We're both smelly, no pointing fingers.
Like we were in the military training.

162
00:16:55,117 --> 00:16:57,796
What did you talk about?

163
00:17:01,596 --> 00:17:05,597
I'll give you three minutes.
Quickly, or I'll really fall asleep.

164
00:17:06,716 --> 00:17:09,557
We talked about everything.

165
00:17:12,236 --> 00:17:14,096
He is your boyfriend now.

166
00:17:15,152 --> 00:17:18,557
You can chat anytime.
Why talking all night?

167
00:17:21,276 --> 00:17:28,560
Actually, I was so sleepy at the end.
I even didn't know what to talk about.

168
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,996
But just sitting with him made me happy.

169
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:35,196
It's good.

170
00:17:41,196 --> 00:17:46,837
- Set an alarm. We'll gather at 3:00 PM.
- Do we need to go so early?

171
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:53,297
I don't know. They said we will watch
the 10th anniversary stage beforehand.

172
00:17:53,297 --> 00:17:57,036
I don't know.
Just don't be late for group activity.

173
00:17:58,516 --> 00:17:59,877
Tomorrow...

174
00:18:20,877 --> 00:18:21,837
Who is it?

175
00:18:33,476 --> 00:18:34,877
I just woke up, sorry.

176
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:40,797
I called you and your room
several times, but no one picked up.

177
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,996
I might have unplugged the phone.

178
00:18:46,397 --> 00:18:48,817
Today we need to drive a great distance
to see a performance.

179
00:18:48,817 --> 00:18:54,097
Yeah, Xiaoxing told me to set an alarm,
but I was so sleepy I forgot.

180
00:18:54,097 --> 00:18:59,297
Is it too late now? You guys go ahead.
It's far. Don't get held up by us.

181
00:18:59,297 --> 00:19:03,157
It's 2:40 PM. You still have time
to take a shower and get ready.

182
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:08,977
- Okay, I'll wake Xiaoxing up and go.
- Meet in the lobby.

183
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:10,196
- Bye.
- Bye.

184
00:19:15,877 --> 00:19:18,157
Geng Xiaoxing, get up!

185
00:19:20,157 --> 00:19:24,157
We have 20 minutes left. You and I
have five minutes each. Hurry, get up!

186
00:19:27,077 --> 00:19:31,797
Five minutes? Didn't you set the alarm?
Sheng, what's the matter?

187
00:19:35,476 --> 00:19:38,917
- I was about to find you.
- I'm getting some sunshine.

188
00:19:39,956 --> 00:19:43,184
It's over 30 degrees today.
Don't you feel hot in the sun?

189
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,760
- Natural light is good for bones.
- Okay, take your time to sunbathe.

190
00:19:48,784 --> 00:19:52,976
And, we stayed up playing mahjong.
Would Sheng and Xiaoxing have overslept?

191
00:19:54,128 --> 00:19:56,676
No, they know how to do.
They won't keep everyone waiting.

192
00:19:58,077 --> 00:20:00,077
Okay, enjoy. I'm leaving.

193
00:20:00,077 --> 00:20:01,077
We are late!

194
00:20:02,476 --> 00:20:06,236
- We'd go upstairs, Sheng, the comb!
- Hurry!

195
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,077
There are so many steps.

196
00:20:10,117 --> 00:20:12,637
- Let's go.
- Good, we're not too late. Go!

197
00:20:16,756 --> 00:20:21,837
- You stayed up but now you're punctual.
- Sheng, I'll get on the bus first.

198
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,896
- How did Mr. Zhu know we stayed up?
- Everyone knows.

199
00:20:27,568 --> 00:20:28,752
You told them?

200
00:20:30,516 --> 00:20:35,516
The mahjong table was in our room.
Do I need to tell him?

201
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,236
I see.

202
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,157
What are you looking at?

203
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:48,637
It's my first time
seeing you in a summer dress.

204
00:20:50,436 --> 00:20:53,756
Because we met in winter.

205
00:20:57,676 --> 00:20:58,837
Let's get on the bus.

206
00:20:59,877 --> 00:21:02,996
Why do I feel like we are just here
to keep them company?

207
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:04,996
That's exactly what it is.

208
00:21:06,837 --> 00:21:09,037
- You two hurry up.
- We're coming.

209
00:21:09,037 --> 00:21:12,837
- Where is Feishao? They're so slow.
- I don't know.

210
00:21:18,157 --> 00:21:20,937
- What's this?
- I bought it this morning.

211
00:21:20,937 --> 00:21:23,597
It heals faster
if you apply it where the mosquito bit.

212
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:46,637
(Is it alright for me
to apply it directly on him?)

213
00:21:50,236 --> 00:21:52,036
I remember
you were also bitten last night.

214
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:54,256
It's okay.

215
00:21:55,996 --> 00:21:58,697
- You can't be lazy.
- I'm really fine.

216
00:21:58,697 --> 00:22:02,877
I saw you scratching all night.
So I bought this. I'm actually okay.

217
00:22:08,557 --> 00:22:09,117

00:23:01,177 --> 00:23:04,557
- Here they come. Hurry up.
- I didn't sleep well last night.

224
00:23:04,557 --> 00:23:08,397
- Exactly, I told you to hurry up.
- You needed to apply the sunscream.

225
00:23:08,397 --> 00:23:09,676
Come on, it was you!

Impression Liu Sanjie,
the most famous performance in Yangshuo.

230
00:23:38,957 --> 00:23:41,537
- My grandpa told me not to miss it.
- Really?

231
00:23:41,537 --> 00:23:44,637
Your grandpa is well-cultured.
Let's go. Go to the grandstand.

232
00:23:47,956 --> 00:23:49,856
- Here?
- Yes.

233
00:23:50,256 --> 00:23:52,617
- Three rooms on the left.
- It's good.

234
00:23:52,617 --> 00:23:54,337
- These three?
- Yes.

235
00:23:54,337 --> 00:23:56,077
Four people each room.
Arrange it by yourselves.

236
00:23:56,077 --> 00:24:00,076
- We can stay in one. Don't hesitate.
- Alright. Let's go.

237
00:24:00,076 --> 00:24:03,757
- Yes, let's sit here.
- What about us?

238
00:24:03,757 --> 00:24:09,840
Sheng'll be with her friend and Qingci.
Me with Feng Yasong or what?

239
00:24:10,896 --> 00:24:11,846
You guys...

240
00:24:11,846 --> 00:24:14,437
- You, Feng Yasong and me, then.
- Okay.

241
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:18,864
Let's go. This is our room.
Yours has the best view. Let's go.

242
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,436
- Let's go then.
- Let's go.

243
00:24:22,476 --> 00:24:23,024
Let's go.

244
00:24:26,276 --> 00:24:27,276
Green bean cake is delicious.

245
00:24:29,157 --> 00:24:32,077
- Help yourself.
- The view is really nice here.

246
00:24:32,077 --> 00:24:35,117
- Purple yam is good.
- Green bean cake is the best.

247
00:24:35,117 --> 00:24:37,956
- The purple yam is good, okay?
- Where would you like to sit? Choose.

248
00:24:39,557 --> 00:24:41,200
- Here.
- Alright.

249
00:24:43,276 --> 00:24:44,276
You... Where are you sitting?

250
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:46,996
I'll sit here.

251
00:24:54,837 --> 00:24:56,624
No need. I'll just go around.

252
00:25:07,363 --> 00:25:07,924
You want some?

253
00:25:09,964 --> 00:25:10,832
- No.

254
00:25:10,832 --> 00:25:12,843
- Then I'll eat.
- You can eat it.

255
00:25:33,404 --> 00:25:36,523
Must have osmanthus cake, right?
It's a special dish here.

256
00:25:37,964 --> 00:25:43,583
This looks good too. Green bean flavor.
But there's only one of each flavor.

257
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:48,884
- Osmanthus or green bean?
- Whichever. We can ask for more.

258
00:25:50,444 --> 00:25:53,204
I can hardly make choice,
especially when it comes to food.

259
00:25:55,884 --> 00:25:59,523
Then, take the osmanthus one.
If I want to eat, I can order again.

260
00:26:04,484 --> 00:26:06,244
- Is it good?
- Yes, it's good.

261
00:26:10,164 --> 00:26:12,364
Imagine how great it would be
if we could perform here.

262
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:16,044
Perform here? Then tie this on your head,
and send Feishao up there.

263
00:26:16,044 --> 00:26:19,363
- And dive straight into the lake.
- Stop it.

264
00:26:23,563 --> 00:26:28,304
It's so quiet here.
I thought you all left.

265
00:26:28,304 --> 00:26:32,864
- Yeah, listening to you is enough.
- Aren't you afraid of complaints?

266
00:26:32,864 --> 00:26:35,600
- We know our limits.
- Exactly.

267
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,244
Besides, it's entrance time now.
Some viewers are noisier than ours.

268
00:26:42,123 --> 00:26:46,864
- Juemei, chat with Sheng's classmate!
- Yeah, aren't you very talkative?

269
00:26:46,864 --> 00:26:49,464
- Why did you become mute now?
- Out of ammo.

270
00:26:49,464 --> 00:26:53,164
Go away.
If I am too eager, that's impolite.

271
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:54,763
I...

272
00:26:56,603 --> 00:27:01,123
- Look, he's shy.
- Macho man with a tender heart.

273
00:27:02,404 --> 00:27:05,404
The charm of this stage
lies in the real scenery.

274
00:27:07,684 --> 00:27:11,544
Zhu chose here just for the landscape.

275
00:27:11,544 --> 00:27:15,603
It's also the first time
we set up a stage in a real place.

276
00:27:17,123 --> 00:27:22,323
A first for Feishao and Wang Ke too.
Performing live in a real setting.

277
00:27:23,724 --> 00:27:25,724
I can hardly wait.

278
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:38,204
(I can't get a word in.
It's so awkward.)

279
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:52,404
(That wasn't sent to me.)

280
00:27:59,363 --> 00:28:01,563
(Just say whatever you want.
It's not like we're in a meeting.)

281
00:28:09,323 --> 00:28:13,424
Let Juemei come up with some topics
to chat with Geng Xiaoxing for a bit.

282
00:28:13,424 --> 00:28:16,884
It's awkward for Xiaoxing to be
sitting there without anyone talking.

283
00:28:20,603 --> 00:28:21,964
They're not familiar with each other.

284
00:28:27,763 --> 00:28:31,283
They've been working on the anniversary.
Aren't they quite familiar?

285
00:28:36,684 --> 00:28:38,444
It depends on themselves.

286
00:28:39,644 --> 00:28:40,964
We can't interfere.

287
00:28:47,484 --> 00:28:48,204
I think...

288
00:29:12,123 --> 00:29:19,404
♪Singing a song♪

289
00:29:21,644 --> 00:29:29,164

00:29:37,244 --> 00:29:47,164

294
00:30:02,484 --> 00:30:06,004
Brother Niu!

295
00:31:01,644 --> 00:31:04,724
Feng Yasong, hurry up. We're waiting.

296
00:31:04,724 --> 00:31:06,608
- I'm coming.
- Slow on everything.

297
00:31:06,608 --> 00:31:08,584
- Don't blame me again.
- They are waiting.

298
00:31:08,584 --> 00:31:10,644
- Just some suggestion.
- What's up?

299
00:31:10,644 --> 00:31:12,424
- Superb!
- What?

300
00:31:12,424 --> 00:31:16,624
I know why you chose Yangshuo.
The natural landscape.

301
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:20,424
Hosting a dubbing drama in Yangshuo
has always been my dream.

302
00:31:20,424 --> 00:31:24,423
Right? Our current capability is good.
Of course, we must pursue our dreams.

303
00:31:24,423 --> 00:31:27,453
Let me tell you. We'll have a full set.

304
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:33,203
The musical, classic singers,
famous cosers, dubbers in one. My dream.

305
00:31:33,203 --> 00:31:38,004
After watching this, we've felt it.
We should prepare for our own show now.

306
00:31:38,004 --> 00:31:43,280
Don't worry. The stage is being built.
We'll do our duties. Leave this to me.

307
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,304
Our Perfect Voice 10th anniversary,
will definitely be a classic.

308
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:49,644
Okay, we'll leave the stage to you.
So next...

309
00:31:53,843 --> 00:31:55,323
Let's go somewhere to eat first?

310
00:31:57,523 --> 00:32:01,044
- I thought you'd say something big.
- But it's Mr. Qiang's style.

311
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:06,884
- No matter what, eat first.
- And it needs to be tasty, not plain.

312
00:32:08,204 --> 00:32:12,024
In fact, the hotel buffet is also good.
Your choice. Let's go.

313
00:32:12,024 --> 00:32:14,604
- What about me and Wang Ke?
- Yeah.

314
00:32:14,604 --> 00:32:18,864
The beer fish in Yangshuo is great.
It's one of Guangxi's top ten dishes.

315
00:32:18,864 --> 00:32:21,644
The food here
is as good as the landscape.

316
00:32:23,724 --> 00:32:26,684
Let's go. He's always so determined
whenever he talks about food.

317
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:32,048
(Sister Xie's Beer Fish)

318
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:51,404
Here, try the beer fish
cooked by the owner himself.

319
00:32:52,803 --> 00:32:54,644
It's the first time
I've seen tomatoes in fish.

320
00:32:54,644 --> 00:32:59,683
Lijiang River water boiled with wild fish.
You'll regret it if you don't taste it.

321
00:32:59,683 --> 00:33:01,924
- You're smart.
- Come on.

322
00:33:03,123 --> 00:33:04,704
- Have a bite, here.
- Thank you.

323
00:33:04,704 --> 00:33:05,603
Taste it.

324
00:33:08,724 --> 00:33:09,603
Is it delicious?

325
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:14,604
- Delicious!
- The tomato is also delicious.

326
00:33:14,604 --> 00:33:16,764
- Really?
- Delicious.

327
00:33:16,764 --> 00:33:22,004
River snails stuffed with meat.
Let me check again.

328
00:33:22,004 --> 00:33:25,224
- River snails stuffed with meat?
- It's also a famous dish.

329
00:33:25,224 --> 00:33:26,824
- Turn it over.
- This is amazing.

330
00:33:26,824 --> 00:33:28,644
- Here, have one.
- Really?

331
00:33:28,644 --> 00:33:30,404
- Another one.
- Roasted chicken.

332
00:33:33,363 --> 00:33:35,644
- Good.
- Eat a chicken leg.

333
00:33:35,644 --> 00:33:37,264
- You can have the chicken leg.
- Thank you.

334
00:33:37,264 --> 00:33:41,184
Chinese bacon, fried bamboo sprouts,
gumbo stuffed with shrimp,

335
00:33:41,184 --> 00:33:45,524
pork steamed with taro, stewed pork,
artemisia argyi rice cake, shrimp.

336
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:46,782
Great!

337
00:33:46,782 --> 00:33:48,863
- Dried radish is good.
- Take one to go.

338
00:33:48,863 --> 00:33:50,724
- So good.
- I'll have one too.

339
00:33:50,724 --> 00:33:51,664
Really, the shoots are good.

340
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:57,043
Mr. Qiang has good taste over food.
It would be a loss for someone who didn't come.

341
00:33:57,043 --> 00:33:59,424
But this is really Mr. Qiang's style.

342
00:33:59,424 --> 00:34:04,363
We have to admit when it comes to food,
Mr. Qiang will never disappoint us.

343
00:34:04,363 --> 00:34:07,604
- Yes.
- You are too blunt.

344
00:34:07,604 --> 00:34:16,343
No. We call this timely realization.
Let's toast to it, shall we?

345
00:34:16,343 --> 00:34:18,844
- Come on, cheers!
- Cheers!

346
00:34:21,203 --> 00:34:27,084
You must visit Xi Street when traveling
in Yangshuo. We have it all.

347
00:34:27,084 --> 00:34:30,603
- Too late to save my stomach now.
- So many people.

348
00:34:30,603 --> 00:34:34,484
- Roasted durian, Yangshuo's specialty.
- Let's buy some next time.

349
00:34:34,484 --> 00:34:37,644
- Roasted durian, Yangshuo's specialty.
- Roasted durian.

350
00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:40,043
Roasted durian, Yangshuo's specialty.

351
00:34:41,523 --> 00:34:43,324
Have a roast durian, freshly roasted.

352
00:34:44,764 --> 00:34:45,844
You can eat durian?

353
00:34:47,404 --> 00:34:49,563
- Smellier than river snails rice noodles.
- Yeah.

354
00:34:49,563 --> 00:34:52,464
We'll have to eat it together,
and stink together.

355
00:34:52,464 --> 00:34:55,844
- Hurry up, eat together! We all eat it.
- Come on.

356
00:34:56,924 --> 00:34:59,404
- Give me one.
- We can share one.

357
00:34:59,404 --> 00:35:02,064
- You all get a share.
- I'll do it.

358
00:35:03,123 --> 00:35:03,804
Good, let's have it.

359
00:35:04,924 --> 00:35:05,884
- I can smell it.
- Come on.

360
00:35:07,163 --> 00:35:09,104
- How does this taste?
- Here.

361
00:35:09,104 --> 00:35:11,243
Yours is not good, for real.
Try mine later. It's super smelly.

362
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:12,883
- Delicious.
- A little rushed.

363
00:35:12,883 --> 00:35:15,623
- Hot? They're not hot.
- Hot.

364
00:35:15,623 --> 00:35:19,044
I was paying here.
Qingci is playing the gentleman there.

365
00:35:19,044 --> 00:35:23,504
- Qingci? You are from Perfect Voice?
- Yes.

366
00:35:23,504 --> 00:35:25,884
I bought your tickets.
I'm going to see your show.

367
00:35:25,884 --> 00:35:27,443
- Really?
- Yes.

368
00:35:27,443 --> 00:35:32,043
- Oh, my god. You are Juemei.
- Hello.

369
00:35:32,043 --> 00:35:34,044
- Good eyes.
- You're Feishao.

370
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:35,404
Yes, he is Feishao.

371
00:35:38,043 --> 00:35:40,043
- Feng Yasong.
- Well.

372
00:35:41,364 --> 00:35:43,583
- It's me! What do you mean?
- You're shamed not to be recognized.

373
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:45,084
- Mu.
- Hello.

374
00:35:45,084 --> 00:35:48,564
Hello, you're Mu's partner, Mo Bai.

375
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:50,824
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

376
00:35:50,824 --> 00:35:55,423
- Where did that person just go?
- Qingci? He left long ago.

377
00:35:55,423 --> 00:35:57,544
I thought I could meet him this time.

378
00:35:57,544 --> 00:36:00,524
Pack up 20 of that for us
and I will take them to our team.

379
00:36:00,524 --> 00:36:04,304
- Ok, let me roast them now.
- 20 more. How much?

380
00:36:04,304 --> 00:36:07,904
- I'll give you a discount.
- No need, just the original price.

381
00:36:07,904 --> 00:36:11,524
- You bought the tickets? What type?
- Just regular ones.

382
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,884
- Here, I'll upgrade you to a VIP seat.
- Really? I didn't get one!

383
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:17,564
- Mr. Zhu is generous.
- Thank you so much.

384
00:36:17,564 --> 00:36:19,123
- Enjoy the show, sister.
- Okay.

385
00:36:19,123 --> 00:36:22,064
- My name is Wang Ke. Listen to my song.
- Sure!

386
00:36:22,064 --> 00:36:24,083
- Enough.
- I paid you 500. Keep the change.

387
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:27,603
- Thank you, Juemei. Thank you.
- Who doesn't know me?

388
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:31,163
Your ability to hide from people
is breathtaking.

389
00:36:38,284 --> 00:36:40,083
I attended offline events
in the early years.

390
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:46,576
- But I didn't use Qiang Qingci.
- Then what did you use?

391
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:51,920
It's different each time.
I'll pick one on the spot for my badge.

392
00:36:53,072 --> 00:36:57,284
So, are you going to never let
your fans know what you look like?

393
00:36:58,444 --> 00:36:59,444
Yes.

394
00:37:04,844 --> 00:37:07,603
They are going to be sad.

395
00:37:21,643 --> 00:37:25,603
- Do I have the smelly flavor left?
- We were eating together. I can't tell.

396
00:37:27,004 --> 00:37:28,123
Then let me brush it again.

397
00:37:38,032 --> 00:37:39,864
(Perfect Voice 10th Anniversary
Live Show Subscribers)

398
00:37:42,163 --> 00:37:42,764
What's wrong?

399
00:37:44,484 --> 00:37:51,744
- Subscribers exceeded 3 million, great.
- Right? I think there are even more.

400
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:56,243
Loyal fans won't bother to subscribe.
They'll just watch it.

401
00:37:57,523 --> 00:37:58,364
Really?

402
00:37:59,924 --> 00:38:01,764
I have to tell them the good news.

403
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:12,304
Is everything ready?
Okay, let's test the sound.

404
00:38:12,304 --> 00:38:15,563
- I'll check the stage. I'll go first.
- Here.

405
00:38:23,163 --> 00:38:26,804
The biggest mortise and tenon structure
I've ever seen. It's beautiful.

406
00:38:27,844 --> 00:38:30,883
Did you like Chinese style and history
since childhood?

407
00:38:30,883 --> 00:38:35,744
My favorite place was museums
when I was young. I loved antiques.

408
00:38:35,744 --> 00:38:39,984
I always feel like I only know a little.

409
00:38:40,464 --> 00:38:42,448
Then you are really like Mo Qingcheng.

410
00:38:43,523 --> 00:38:46,664
- Really? He likes it too?
- Yes.

411
00:38:46,664 --> 00:38:52,364
One, two, one, one, two. Mao,
could you turn the sound louder here?

412
00:38:53,523 --> 00:38:58,784
He seldom goes on stage.
So, what is he testing on stage now?

413
00:38:58,784 --> 00:39:01,704
He is testing the foldback
for Wang Ke and Feishao.

414
00:39:01,704 --> 00:39:07,684
He's always been like this. Not on stage.
But he cares every detail.

415
00:39:07,684 --> 00:39:14,704
Like makeup, styling, the script, etc.
He took care of the entire dubbing team.

416
00:39:14,704 --> 00:39:18,243
One, two, one, two, one, two.

417
00:39:21,804 --> 00:39:24,484
The rain outside is endless.

418
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:31,964
Shen Zhaozhao doesn't know if
it really rains or just in her dreams.

419
00:39:32,592 --> 00:39:38,243
She felt like returning to Chaisang's
General Mansion, a shadow with a lamp.

420
00:39:39,404 --> 00:39:44,964
In the cream yellow light,
she searches for that shadow.

421
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:47,284
Has my brother

422
00:39:49,523 --> 00:39:51,364
passed Luojia Mountain yet?

423
00:39:53,004 --> 00:39:56,163
The general was fighting at the river
and there was no news of his return.

424
00:40:02,364 --> 00:40:03,243
Let's put out

425
00:40:05,163 --> 00:40:06,043
the lamp.

426
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:08,912
Shen Zhaozhao doesn't know

427
00:40:10,203 --> 00:40:12,043
if she will ever see her brother again

428
00:40:14,444 --> 00:40:16,123
before she dies.

429
00:40:17,924 --> 00:40:19,404
Go find the red cloth.

430
00:40:20,804 --> 00:40:26,444
- The palace is a mess. I can't find it.
- Go find the red cloth. Go.

431
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:33,604
This time they change it
to a live dubbing. I watch a few online.

432
00:40:33,604 --> 00:40:35,324
I never heard of those before.

433
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:41,843
In the past, dubbers were behind scenes
and rarely appeared on stage.

434
00:40:41,843 --> 00:40:44,004
So, they can't have this living show.

435
00:40:45,324 --> 00:40:47,923
They were all very appealing.

436
00:40:47,923 --> 00:40:53,264
Although they just read lines on stage,
they were able to get into character.

437
00:40:53,264 --> 00:40:57,984
Half of the generals are disloyal.
They've been thinking of betraying you.

438
00:40:57,984 --> 00:41:02,764
They are all voice actors.
They can draw the viewers into the play.

439
00:41:04,324 --> 00:41:05,328
Go.

440
00:41:06,484 --> 00:41:07,523
Find the red cloth.

441
00:41:09,364 --> 00:41:10,404
This country,

442
00:41:11,563 --> 00:41:12,924
I will hand it to the crown prince.

443
00:41:14,964 --> 00:41:18,844
I finally saw the look in your eyes,
as a fan, looking at your idol.

444
00:41:21,804 --> 00:41:26,523
Okay, I think it's good.
Once it's set, we will have a rehearsal.

445
00:41:27,804 --> 00:41:32,764
Two hours before the official rehearsal.
Shall we go back to the hotel and rest?

446
00:41:32,764 --> 00:41:36,044
Okay, I'll go first then.
Sheng has been waiting for a long time.

447
00:41:36,044 --> 00:41:37,683
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

448
00:41:37,683 --> 00:41:42,284
Our mahjong partner, come on!
We have two hours. Let's play.

449
00:41:42,284 --> 00:41:44,243
Coming. I'll go then.

450
00:41:54,404 --> 00:41:55,004
You're sweating?

451
00:41:56,043 --> 00:41:56,523
Wait a moment.

452
00:42:03,043 --> 00:42:04,004
Is it too hot?

453
00:42:19,284 --> 00:42:20,884
Okay, let's go.

454
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:27,600
Two hours, what to do?

455
00:42:28,688 --> 00:42:30,243
It seems like whatever we do,
it won't be enough.

456
00:42:32,643 --> 00:42:37,164
The staff said there are two roads
behind the mountain.

457
00:42:37,164 --> 00:42:41,064
One takes one hour on bikes.
One takes two hours on bikes.

458
00:42:41,064 --> 00:42:44,764
- Which one should we choose?
- Well, let's choose the further one.

459
00:43:01,643 --> 00:43:04,523
- Someone's fishing. Let's go there.
- Okay.

460
00:43:10,523 --> 00:43:11,004
