00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:44,368
(- Shengshengman.
- I'm here.)

26
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,131
Hurry up. We'll be late for breakfast.

27
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:55,771
Brother.

28
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:03,652
Sheng, I'm here.

29
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:05,411
Can't we talk on the phone?

30
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:07,051
Why the voice chat room?

31
00:02:07,652 --> 00:02:08,931
I'm boosting my EXP.

32
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:10,051
Fine.

33
00:02:10,732 --> 00:02:12,771
You'll be
the music director for the event.

34
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:14,452
Do a good job.

35
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:17,292
- Okay.
- Without a payment, though.

36
00:02:17,732 --> 00:02:18,811
What are you eating?

37
00:02:19,132 --> 00:02:19,972
I tell you.

38
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:24,172
I'm having this amazing bun.

39
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,572
I'll get you one next time.

40
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:30,892
(Ancheng Bus)
The bus is here.

41
00:02:33,252 --> 00:02:34,051
On the bus now.

42
00:02:34,132 --> 00:02:35,531
I'll call you from the dorm.

43
00:02:36,611 --> 00:02:38,412
Don't hang up. Let's keep talking.

44
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,771
How was the birthday dinner
with your cousin?

45
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:42,292
Did you use the coupons?

46
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:43,531
Yeah.

47
00:02:45,012 --> 00:02:48,491
The pork stomach with chicken
was super good.

48
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:49,412
(Geng Xiaoxing)
Sheng.

49
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:52,531
Are you tormenting yourself or me?

50
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:53,732
I tell you.

51
00:02:53,852 --> 00:02:55,412
It's the first time I realized

52
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:58,651
how amazing it is to stew them together.

53
00:02:59,012 --> 00:02:59,811
Think about it.

54
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:02,371
The soup turns white

55
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:06,852
and gives off the aroma
of herbs and pepper.

56
00:03:07,172 --> 00:03:08,012
Geng Xiaoxing.

57
00:03:08,172 --> 00:03:10,252
I'll take you to try it once.

58
00:03:10,412 --> 00:03:11,132
I swear.

59
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:12,611
The one next to

60
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:15,292
the First People's Hospital
is one of the best.

61
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:18,852
Why are you silent?

62
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,252
It's a famous Cantonese Hakka dish.

63
00:03:23,572 --> 00:03:27,371
You can try to make it at home.

64
00:03:27,531 --> 00:03:28,771
(Qiang Qingci)

65
00:03:29,491 --> 00:03:30,611
(It's Qiang Qingci!)

66
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:33,292
(Why is he in my voice chat room?)

67
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:35,651
It just takes time.

68
00:03:36,531 --> 00:03:38,771
And it's troublesome
to wash the pork stomach.

69
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:40,972
It's good for health.

70
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:48,531
I remember there are

71
00:03:49,651 --> 00:03:50,252
dates,

72
00:03:50,972 --> 00:03:51,892
Dang Shen,

73
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:53,931
Polygonatum Root,

74
00:03:54,452 --> 00:03:55,371
goji berries,

75
00:03:57,611 --> 00:04:00,252
and some other common spices.

76
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:06,091
Seal the chicken
in the pork stomach with toothpicks.

77
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:08,572
Stew them well.

78
00:04:09,811 --> 00:04:11,732
(Qiang Qingci)
Mr. Qiang Qingci.

79
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:14,091
Can you hear me?

80
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:20,211
Sheng.

81
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:21,812
Sheng.

82
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,291
(Geng Xiaoxing)
I'm back. Still there?

83
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:28,692
The dorm manager came for an inspection.

84
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:29,651
Go on.

85
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:33,971
Pork stomach with chicken.

86
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:38,091
So you didn't hear Qiang Qingci talking?

87
00:04:38,572 --> 00:04:39,411
Qiang Qingci?

88
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:40,211
What's that?

89
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:43,091
The famous dubbing actor Qiang Qingci.

90
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:44,432
From the Perfect Voice Studio.

91
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:47,091
I know that studio.

92
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:48,132
I've heard of it.

93
00:04:48,692 --> 00:04:49,692
How do you spell his name?

94
00:04:49,971 --> 00:04:51,651
Qiang Qingci.

95
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:54,612
Qiang spells like Q-i-a-n-g.

96
00:04:54,771 --> 00:04:56,411
It means a color.

97
00:04:56,612 --> 00:04:58,971
Ci means "magnetic".

98
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:00,252
Got it?

99
00:05:04,455 --> 00:05:07,344
(Qiang Qingci entered the room.
Qiang Qingci left the room.)

100
00:05:15,052 --> 00:05:17,291
(Qiang Qingci really
entered my voice chat room,)

101
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:19,771
(and taught me a recipe.)

102
00:05:23,737 --> 00:05:26,256
(Tianzi No. 1 Recording Studio)
(The Perfect Voice Studio)

103
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:27,633
(The Perfect Voice Studio)

104
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:29,040
(Recording, Studio A Control Room)

105
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:36,132
(Sound Mixing Room)

106
00:05:36,132 --> 00:05:37,012
This is Qiang Qingci.

107
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:38,692
I'll give it a try.

108
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,651
- Morning, Mr. Juemei.
- Morning.

109
00:05:49,171 --> 00:05:50,012
Morning, Mr. Juemei.

110
00:05:50,012 --> 00:05:50,651
Morning.

111
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:52,731
Is Qiang Qingci back?

112
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:53,331
Yeah.

113
00:05:53,692 --> 00:05:55,612
He's sleeping after
the night shift at the hospital.

114
00:05:55,612 --> 00:05:57,012
See you. Let me talk to him.

115
00:05:57,012 --> 00:05:57,812
Be quiet.

116
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:07,851
Wake up. It's daytime.

117
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,812
Are you coming to the studio's
tenth anniversary ceremony?

118
00:06:15,692 --> 00:06:17,492
Let's wait for the hospital schedule.

119
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:18,692
Juemei.

120
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,132
I'm craving pork stomach with chicken.

121
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,411
I heard the one next to

122
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,252
my hospital is good.

123
00:06:25,091 --> 00:06:26,452
Okay, I'll book a table.

124
00:06:26,892 --> 00:06:27,651
Hurry up.

125
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:31,211
Kids.

126
00:06:31,372 --> 00:06:34,052
It will be the final test
after the New Year Festival.

127
00:06:34,171 --> 00:06:37,012
This is your last test
before graduation.

128
00:06:37,252 --> 00:06:39,372
I hope you can enjoy the last semester

129
00:06:39,492 --> 00:06:41,091
no matter whether you're

130
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:44,692
pursuing further education
or going to work.

131
00:06:44,812 --> 00:06:45,892
Contact me via WeChat

132
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:47,892
if you have any questions.

133
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:49,252
That's it for today.

134
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:50,372
Dismiss.

135
00:06:52,331 --> 00:06:54,132
Goodbye, Madam.

136
00:06:56,052 --> 00:06:57,932
I envy
you secured a place at graduate school.

137
00:06:58,091 --> 00:06:59,132
You don't have to work,

138
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,091
and you can enjoy
more of the school life.

139
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:03,012
We're from the same dorm.

140
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:04,651
Why can't I be like you?

141
00:07:04,932 --> 00:07:05,731
Qi Yao.

142
00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:07,812
Haven't you considered
any graduate programs?

143
00:07:08,851 --> 00:07:10,331
I'm dying to work

144
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:11,851
and support myself.

145
00:07:11,971 --> 00:07:13,651
I can't wait.

146
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,572
You'll see how exhausting it is.

147
00:07:20,012 --> 00:07:21,252
Xiaoxing, are you going

148
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:22,132
to the company?

149
00:07:22,252 --> 00:07:23,291
No.

150
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,531
I'm just an intern.

151
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:26,452
I don't need to punch in every day

152
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,091
as long as I do my job.

153
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:29,851
My only task today

154
00:07:30,012 --> 00:07:31,812
is to contact the Perfect Voice Studio.

155
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:33,171
The Perfect Voice Studio?

156
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:34,452
The Perfect Voice Studio?

157
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:35,531
Unbelievable!

158
00:07:35,651 --> 00:07:37,211
The company I'm working at

159
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:39,252
developed an app and wants to

160
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:40,612
promote it.

161
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:42,372
I told you about it.

162
00:07:42,452 --> 00:07:44,851
I'm making Sheng the music director.

163
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:47,692
You said
you'd make me the music director,

164
00:07:48,252 --> 00:07:50,291
but nothing
about the Perfect Voice Studio.

165
00:07:52,812 --> 00:07:54,012
It's so good.

166
00:07:54,132 --> 00:07:55,531
Try the meat.

167
00:07:58,052 --> 00:07:58,771
They started out

168
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:01,372
doing dubbing online.

169
00:08:01,492 --> 00:08:02,692
It was a small circle.

170
00:08:02,851 --> 00:08:05,612
They did it purely because they loved it

171
00:08:05,731 --> 00:08:07,731
and gained fame over the years.

172
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:09,291
Sheng is my senior.

173
00:08:09,452 --> 00:08:11,171
She's always adored Qiang Qingci.

174
00:08:11,531 --> 00:08:13,932
He wasn't known back then, right?

175
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:17,012
So how did you know him?

176
00:08:17,132 --> 00:08:19,651
It was a promotional video of a game.

177
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:23,091
I happened to see it.

178
00:08:23,892 --> 00:08:26,572
That's when I heard his voice.

179
00:08:30,851 --> 00:08:34,332
I kind of fell in love with his voice.

180
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,451
What does he sound like?

181
00:08:40,691 --> 00:08:42,732
His voice is totally my type.

182
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:44,771
He sounds amazing.

183
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,931
How does he look?

184
00:08:47,651 --> 00:08:48,651
I haven't met him.

185
00:08:50,332 --> 00:08:51,852
No one has.

186
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:54,132
He never shows up.

187
00:08:59,332 --> 00:08:59,931
Here.

188
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:01,691
Here.

189
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:06,012
The meat is amazing.

190
00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:10,132
Mr. Mo is the best.

191
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,492
We always get a treat
the day after the performance.

192
00:09:13,092 --> 00:09:14,012
When has he ever

193
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:15,171
been stingy to you,

194
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:16,012
Wang Ke?

195
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:17,332
Yeah, yeah.

196
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:18,492
Dig in.

197
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:21,771
I have work to do.

198
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:22,531
I'll not drink it.

199
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:23,972
You don't have work today.

200
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:25,252
The hospital work again?

201
00:09:26,092 --> 00:09:28,171
My colleague is giving birth.
I'm taking her shift.

202
00:09:28,612 --> 00:09:29,732
So busy.

203
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,811
About the tenth anniversary ceremony.

204
00:09:32,931 --> 00:09:33,892
Have you decided?

205
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:36,732
Don't count me in.

206
00:09:36,852 --> 00:09:37,571
Too busy.

207
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:39,571
Every time.

208
00:09:40,332 --> 00:09:40,931
Cheers.

209
00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:48,411
But he rarely attends any events.

210
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:51,451
There are two other people
in the Perfect Voice Studio.

211
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:53,691
They are the Top Three in the business.

212
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:54,492
Qiang Qingci.

213
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:55,451
Juemei Shayi.

214
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:56,492
Feng Yasong.

215
00:09:56,651 --> 00:09:57,612
They are quite distinctive

216
00:09:57,732 --> 00:09:59,051
and have many fans.

217
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:01,612
It'd be amazing if you could invite

218
00:10:01,732 --> 00:10:02,931
all three of them.

219
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:03,892
Yeah.

220
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,492
I just love

221
00:10:05,651 --> 00:10:07,531
taking challenges.

222
00:10:13,328 --> 00:10:15,732
(Hello, I'm Geng Xiaoxing.
Would you attend the event I mentioned?)

223
00:10:15,732 --> 00:10:16,931
It's a girl?

224
00:10:17,411 --> 00:10:18,531
Your girlfriend?

225
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,051
Nonsense.

226
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:21,171
Someone

227
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,291
is inviting us to promote their app.

228
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,332
Who do they want?

229
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:26,852
I'm most probably booked.

230
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:29,571
Not you.

231
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:33,972
They want the Top Three dubbing actors
of the Perfect Voice Studio.

232
00:10:35,372 --> 00:10:36,132
Not you.

233
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:40,132
Alright, Top Three.

234
00:10:41,262 --> 00:10:41,972
(App Fufu, Star Child)

235
00:10:41,972 --> 00:10:43,012
Wait.

236
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:45,771
They invited you and Feng Yasong.
I kind of get it.

237
00:10:46,372 --> 00:10:48,612
But who can possibly
get him to an event?

238
00:10:48,852 --> 00:10:50,612
Seriously, I've checked the list.

239
00:10:50,771 --> 00:10:52,212
I don't know anyone.

240
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:52,931
Look.

241
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:55,651
(Main producers)
Do you know Geng Xiaoxing?

242
00:10:55,852 --> 00:10:56,492
No.

243
00:10:56,732 --> 00:10:58,411
Not the rest, either.

244
00:10:58,531 --> 00:11:00,892
(Music director Shengshengman)
And there's a music director.

245
00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:02,012
Shengshengman.

246
00:11:02,132 --> 00:11:02,691
Do you know her?

247
00:11:03,051 --> 00:11:04,252
No.

248
00:11:05,212 --> 00:11:06,171
Shengshengman.

249
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:07,892
What's wrong?

250
00:11:08,012 --> 00:11:08,931
You know her?

251
00:11:12,771 --> 00:11:13,492
I remember something.

252
00:11:16,612 --> 00:11:17,372
What?

253
00:11:17,531 --> 00:11:18,651
What do you remember?

254
00:11:27,847 --> 00:11:30,974
(Do you sense something?)

255
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:35,012
What?

256
00:11:35,771 --> 00:11:38,212
Why are you texting me on WeChat?

257
00:11:44,212 --> 00:11:45,972
Mr. Mo, have some chicken.

258
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:47,612
It's really tender.

259
00:11:47,612 --> 00:11:48,852
Have some soup.

260
00:11:51,012 --> 00:11:51,888
Where are you going?

261
00:11:52,092 --> 00:11:53,012
To get some dipping.

262
00:11:55,051 --> 00:11:55,651
What?

263
00:11:55,811 --> 00:11:59,012
Think about it.
How can he know someone and we don't?

264
00:12:01,212 --> 00:12:02,171
Accept the invitation.

265
00:12:02,332 --> 00:12:03,411
I want to meet Shengshengman.

266
00:12:03,571 --> 00:12:04,931
For what?

267
00:12:05,132 --> 00:12:05,892
To gossip.

268
00:12:06,012 --> 00:12:07,411
It's tiring to talk to you.

269
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:08,291
So insensitive.

270
00:12:09,132 --> 00:12:10,571
Show some respect.

271
00:12:11,571 --> 00:12:12,691
I'll get some dipping.

272
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:28,571
(In this play that lasts for ages,)

273
00:12:29,372 --> 00:12:32,651
(we're both playing our parts.)

274
00:12:35,931 --> 00:12:37,771
(His profile lit up by the lamp)

275
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:41,411
(has the depressing vibe of a playboy.)

276
00:12:42,451 --> 00:12:43,492
(Eventually, she realized...)

277
00:12:43,492 --> 00:12:44,531
Great dubbing.

278
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:45,691
It got me absorbed.

279
00:12:45,691 --> 00:12:47,291
(Between the dim light and shadows...)

280
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,892
Mr. Mo, another masterpiece.

281

(He sits on piles of skeletons)

282
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:55,171
(to defend the nation.)

283
00:12:55,171 --> 00:12:56,732
That was Qiang Qingci.

284
00:12:57,051 --> 00:12:59,092
Attractive and amazing, right?

285
00:12:59,252 --> 00:13:00,132
Sounds amazing.

286
00:13:07,212 --> 00:13:08,732
The food was so good.

287
00:13:09,451 --> 00:13:11,051
Sheng,
your recommended one is really tasty.

288
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:13,291
Did Juemei reply?

289
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:15,212
Let me check.

290
00:13:18,492 --> 00:13:21,972
Not yet. I bet he's not interested
because our app is unknown.

291
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,092
And I stressed

292
00:13:23,212 --> 00:13:25,132
our music director is Shengshengman.

293
00:13:25,492 --> 00:13:27,132
I'm nobody.

294
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,132
They wouldn't know me.

295
00:13:29,252 --> 00:13:30,732
No, you're amazing.

296
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:31,571
Let's wait.

297
00:13:31,732 --> 00:13:32,771
We may be surprised.

298
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:33,811
Stay positive.

299
00:13:33,931 --> 00:13:34,612
Yeah.

300
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:36,212
The car is here. Let's go.

301
00:13:36,571 --> 00:13:38,012
Hurry up.

302
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:42,492
Shengshengman is a poem name, right?

303
00:13:44,972 --> 00:13:46,451
What? Am I wrong?

304
00:13:47,132 --> 00:13:47,852
No.

305
00:13:48,012 --> 00:13:49,291
It's rudimentary knowledge.

306
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:52,212
We can't drive. Did you drive here?

307
00:13:52,411 --> 00:13:53,291
No.

308
00:13:53,691 --> 00:13:54,811
So what do we do?

309
00:13:54,972 --> 00:13:55,732
Got your bus cards?

310
00:13:55,732 --> 00:13:56,651
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:13:57,012 --> 00:13:58,212

316
00:14:34,852 --> 00:14:35,811
Surprising?

What's her name?

318
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:41,852

320
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:44,612
Nice name.

They sound like a couple.

322
00:14:46,531 --> 00:14:48,571
Right? That's what I thought.

323
00:14:48,691 --> 00:14:50,531
But are you sure you got it right?

324
00:14:50,972 --> 00:14:52,972
Mr. Mo barely goes online.

325
00:14:53,171 --> 00:14:55,492

00:14:57,132 --> 00:14:57,691
This may

328
00:14:57,892 --> 00:14:59,132

Mr. Mo, you owe me
a game dubbing this month.

00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:43,051
You're on your own.

378
00:16:45,132 --> 00:16:46,092
(Breaking news.)

379
00:16:46,531 --> 00:16:47,492
(They said yes.)

380
00:16:47,612 --> 00:16:49,291
(The Perfect Voice Studio
will work with us.)

381
00:16:49,972 --> 00:16:51,212
(Breaking News No. 2.)

382
00:16:51,492 --> 00:16:52,372
(Deep breath.)

383
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:55,372
(Today, at 6 PM,)

384
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:57,252
(they want an online meeting with us.)

385
00:16:57,372 --> 00:16:59,852
(At 6 PM, the Top Three will be there.)

386
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:02,931
Gu Jia, what time is it?

387
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:05,731
5:40 PM. Why?

388
00:17:05,731 --> 00:17:06,411
(5:40 PM)

389
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:07,572
(Twenty minutes by bike.)

390
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:09,251
(I won't make it. Ten minutes by car.)

391
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:10,532
(Turn on the PC in five minutes.)

392
00:17:10,532 --> 00:17:11,251
(I'm out of time.)

393
00:17:11,332 --> 00:17:13,812
Gu Jia, I have things to do.
I'm going home.

394
00:17:13,892 --> 00:17:14,612
Watch the store.

395
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:16,211
We're not off work. Where are you going?

396
00:17:16,211 --> 00:17:16,931
It's important.

397
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:18,132
Wait. What's the rush?

398
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:18,772
It's important.

399
00:17:18,892 --> 00:17:20,251
Bye.

400
00:17:20,411 --> 00:17:22,411
Put on the jacket. It's cold outside.

401
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:28,411
Thanks, sir.

402
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:42,332
Hello, Sheng.

403
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:43,572
- Sister.
- Hello, Auntie.

404
00:17:52,892 --> 00:17:53,651
Father, Grandfather.

405
00:17:54,092 --> 00:17:54,931
Hey, there.

406
00:17:56,251 --> 00:17:57,171
I'll be in my room.

407
00:18:01,892 --> 00:18:04,132
What's the rush?

408
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:14,532
Headphones.

409
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,696
(Chat and find friends)
(Shengshengman)

410
00:18:28,491 --> 00:18:30,992
(Doudoubing)
Xiaoxing. I saw your project plan.

411
00:18:30,992 --> 00:18:32,052
I like it. It's meaningful.

412
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:34,132
Thank you, Doudou.

413
00:18:35,092 --> 00:18:38,132
Our next major event will be
the studio's tenth anniversary.

414
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:39,052
(He's not here yet.)

415
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:40,892
We will organize a big promotion.

416
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:43,691
(Geng Xiaoxing, I'm here.)
It's a great chance for cooperation.

417
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:45,292
Juemei.

418
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:46,852
That's exactly what I thought.

419
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:48,572
I remember...

420
00:18:48,572 --> 00:18:49,251
(I'm here.)

421
00:18:49,332 --> 00:18:50,852
We release a musical song

422
00:18:50,852 --> 00:18:51,852
every year.

423
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:53,712
(Wang Ke)
What about this year, Doudou?

424
00:18:53,971 --> 00:18:56,372
(Shengshengman)
It's the same. But do you have time to record it?

425
00:18:56,532 --> 00:18:57,171
Someone's here.

426
00:18:57,651 --> 00:18:58,411
I'm on standby.

427
00:19:05,132 --> 00:19:06,691
(Qiang Qingci)
So you've been there.

428
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:08,731
Why didn't you say something?

429
00:19:09,132 --> 00:19:10,332
I've been here.

430
00:19:10,612 --> 00:19:12,292
But I'm not talking to you.

431
00:19:12,491 --> 00:19:13,292
Close the mic.

432
00:19:13,731 --> 00:19:14,292
Alright.

433
00:19:15,092 --> 00:19:16,880
(Qiang Qingci)

434
00:19:18,011 --> 00:19:18,892
Shengshengman.

435
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:27,971
Yeah.

436
00:19:29,171 --> 00:19:30,052
Shengshengman.

437
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:32,574
(Qiang Qingci)

438
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:34,572
(Geng Xiaoxing)
Sheng, he's calling you.

439
00:19:35,612 --> 00:19:36,612
I'm here.

440
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:37,931
Sheng.

441
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:39,411
Are you there?

442
00:19:40,052 --> 00:19:41,011
Yeah.

443
00:19:43,931 --> 00:19:45,612
I bet she's eating something.

444
00:19:45,731 --> 00:19:47,052
What a foodie.

445
00:19:53,812 --> 00:19:55,132
I forgot the mic.

446
00:19:57,491 --> 00:19:59,931
(Shengshengman)
Sorry, I forgot the mic.

447
00:20:00,211 --> 00:20:01,011
I'm here.

448
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:06,892
Have you tried to make
the pork stomach with chicken?

449
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:09,651
(He remembers.)

450
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,132
Not yet.

451
00:20:14,812 --> 00:20:16,491
I didn't have time.

452
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:21,616
(Shengshengman)

453
00:20:22,812 --> 00:20:24,491
(Is it impolite?)

454
00:20:24,651 --> 00:20:26,892
(He told me
how to make it step by step.)

455
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,292
(I should at least show interest.)

456
00:20:31,411 --> 00:20:34,411
Thank you for your instruction.

457
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:38,971
I will try it for sure.

458
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:46,000
(Your computer needs to be restarted.)

459
00:20:48,903 --> 00:20:50,572
(Qiang Qingci offline)

460
00:20:50,572 --> 00:20:52,292
(Why is he offline?)

461
00:20:52,491 --> 00:20:54,011
(Is he upset?)

462
00:20:57,171 --> 00:20:58,852
On your PC?

463
00:20:59,612 --> 00:21:00,411
Put it away.

464
00:21:00,731 --> 00:21:02,332
Come downstairs.

465
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:05,052
Sheng, hurry up.

466
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:06,971
Got it.

467
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:13,292
Mother.

468
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:14,451
What's wrong?

469
00:21:15,171 --> 00:21:16,132
Your cousin

470
00:21:16,251 --> 00:21:18,491
said you left the supermarket
without having food.

471
00:21:18,572 --> 00:21:19,931
What's the rush?

472
00:21:21,411 --> 00:21:23,251
I didn't have time. I had to talk

473
00:21:23,372 --> 00:21:24,211
to Geng Xiaoxing.

474
00:21:24,411 --> 00:21:25,052
Alright.

475
00:21:25,211 --> 00:21:26,332
Here's the noodle.

476
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:27,372
Eat it.

477
00:21:27,572 --> 00:21:28,332
Thank you, mother.

478
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:29,651
I'll eat upstairs.

479
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,292
Why don't you eat it here?

480
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:33,852
Slow down.

481
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,024
(1 message from Qiang Qingci)

482
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,832
(1 message from Qiang Qingci)

483
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:57,651
(I forgot to tell you.)

484
00:21:57,772 --> 00:22:00,112
(That dish is also called
"Reincarnation of the Phoenix".)

485
00:22:04,251 --> 00:22:05,532
(Thanks.)

486
00:22:06,411 --> 00:22:07,052
(You're welcome.)

487
00:22:07,171 --> 00:22:08,251
(Your name reminds me)

488
00:22:08,332 --> 00:22:09,651
(of a nice dish.)

489
00:22:14,612 --> 00:22:15,491
(What is it?)

490
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:18,011
(Okra stuffed with shrimp paste.)

491
00:22:21,572 --> 00:22:23,052
(Sounds tasty.)

492
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:25,451
(I tried to make it once.)

493
00:22:25,931 --> 00:22:26,491
(It's easy.)

494
00:22:27,491 --> 00:22:29,372
(Chop the shrimp into a paste.)

495
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:31,892
(Add scallion and ginger water,)

496
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:34,772
(cooking wine, salt, MSG,)

497
00:22:35,211 --> 00:22:36,132
(and white pepper.)

498
00:22:36,411 --> 00:22:37,211
(Clean the okra seeds.)

499
00:22:37,931 --> 00:22:39,651
(Fill them up and steam them.)

500
00:22:40,171 --> 00:22:41,651
(Serve with Thai Sweet Chili Sauce.)

501
00:22:42,572 --> 00:22:43,411
(It's really nice.)

502
00:23:00,211 --> 00:23:00,931
Mother.

503
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:03,491
Do we have any meat,

504
00:23:03,612 --> 00:23:04,931
vegetables, or shrimp left?

505
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:07,211
Or just make me an egg.

506
00:23:11,971 --> 00:23:13,651
(He's such a foodie?)

507
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:15,532
(He never mentioned it
in any interviews.)

508
00:23:51,372 --> 00:23:51,892
Mr. Mo.

509
00:23:52,052 --> 00:23:53,651
That's all you have for dinner?

510
00:23:56,132 --> 00:23:57,931
It's so sad. You make lots of money,

511
00:23:58,211 --> 00:23:59,931
but you can't enjoy life.

512
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:05,532
Don't eat that.

513
00:24:05,731 --> 00:24:06,931
It lacks nutrition.

514
00:24:11,411 --> 00:24:12,211
What's the flavor?

515
00:24:12,572 --> 00:24:13,292
Let me see...

516
00:24:18,612 --> 00:24:20,572
Let me see what you put in there.

517
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:22,052
I'll make one for myself.

518
00:24:26,691 --> 00:24:27,572
Did you wash your hands?

519
00:24:27,892 --> 00:24:28,451
No.

520
00:24:30,731 --> 00:24:32,731
Doudou,
do you have disposable chopsticks?

521
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:37,011
- Thanks.
- Want some noodles?

522
00:24:37,812 --> 00:24:38,731
No, thanks.

523
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:39,971
You can't cook.

524
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:42,411
Mr. Mo makes better noodles.

525
00:24:43,651 --> 00:24:45,092
Whatever.

526
00:24:45,211 --> 00:24:46,812
He never saves noodles for anyone.

527
00:24:46,931 --> 00:24:47,931
Stop daydreaming.

528
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:49,211
I'm not anyone.

529
00:24:49,372 --> 00:24:50,572
Of course, he saved me some.

530
00:24:56,772 --> 00:24:57,251
Alright.

531
00:24:58,411 --> 00:24:59,651
I'll get a takeout.

532
00:24:59,772 --> 00:25:00,772
A hot pot.

533
00:25:00,892 --> 00:25:03,572
No, you filled the room
with that smell last time.

534
00:25:03,651 --> 00:25:04,852
Have this.

535
00:25:07,011 --> 00:25:09,451
Fine, it's better than nothing.

536
00:25:12,931 --> 00:25:13,451
Mr. Mo.

537
00:25:15,011 --> 00:25:16,892
I've been dying to ask you something.

538
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:19,812
How did you meet

539
00:25:21,491 --> 00:25:22,812
Shengshengman?

540
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:27,772
You're curious?

541
00:25:29,052 --> 00:25:30,052
Very curious.

542
00:25:30,211 --> 00:25:32,092
Tell me all about it.

543
00:25:35,491 --> 00:25:37,892
It was an accident.

544
00:25:38,612 --> 00:25:39,211
Are you done?

545
00:25:39,211 --> 00:25:40,052
Accident. Wait.

546
00:25:40,691 --> 00:25:41,572
That's it?

547
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,052
How did it happen?

548
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:45,931
Between whom?

549
00:25:46,491 --> 00:25:47,612
So secretive.

550
00:25:51,931 --> 00:25:52,651
Doudou.

551
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:54,971
- Doudou.
- What?

552
00:25:55,132 --> 00:25:56,211
- One question.
- Go ahead.

553
00:25:58,171 --> 00:26:00,211
When are we holding the meeting

554
00:26:00,332 --> 00:26:01,411
for that app promotion?

555
00:26:01,772 --> 00:26:04,491
Just ask me
when we will meet Shengshengman.

556
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,532
When?

557
00:26:08,691 --> 00:26:09,491
In two weeks.

558
00:26:10,892 --> 00:26:12,532
But it's our tenth anniversary.

559
00:26:12,691 --> 00:26:15,572
I can invite them to some events.

560
00:26:15,892 --> 00:26:17,491
I don't know if they'd come, though.

561
00:26:17,772 --> 00:26:19,451
Of course, they would.

562
00:26:20,411 --> 00:26:21,292

it's a common feature

- Got it.

804
00:39:11,451 --> 00:39:12,011
It went well.

805
00:39:12,212 --> 00:39:14,372
The patient is quite stabilized now.

806
00:39:15,971 --> 00:39:17,011
I didn't even have

807
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:19,011
any water last night.

808
00:39:19,131 --> 00:39:20,252
Now I have two more patients.

809

00:39:21,812 --> 00:39:22,732
Alright, no problem.

811

I'll buy you food.

812
00:39:25,692 --> 00:39:29,451
Right, you were gone for 20 minutes
at the supermarket.

813
00:39:30,732 --> 00:39:31,451
Where were you?

814
00:39:31,852 --> 00:39:33,411
I met an old couple

815
00:39:34,571 --> 00:39:35,812
during my shift.

816
00:39:35,892 --> 00:39:37,332
The grandpa had a cerebral hemorrhage.

817
00:39:37,411 --> 00:39:38,411
His kids were not here,

818
00:39:38,571 --> 00:39:40,451
and he didn't know about the procedures.

819
00:39:40,971 --> 00:39:42,292
So I added him on WeChat.

820
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:44,091
Last night,

821
00:39:44,212 --> 00:39:46,091
he got temporarily paralyzed.

822
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:47,931
So,

823
00:39:48,451 --> 00:39:49,652
I went to check on them.

824
00:39:50,491 --> 00:39:51,571
After service?

825
00:39:52,611 --> 00:39:54,091
He came to me first.

826
00:39:54,411 --> 00:39:55,011
It's fate.

827
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:02,812
You've been

828
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,131
single for too long

829
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:06,772
and become too gossipy.

830
00:40:10,131 --> 00:40:12,332
You'd better find yourself a girl.

It's good for digestion.

835
00:40:28,252 --> 00:40:30,531
Don't call me that again.

836
00:40:32,491 --> 00:40:33,692
