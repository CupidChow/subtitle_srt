Are you sleepy?

28
00:02:14,779 --> 00:02:19,659
- Yeah. But I can keep going.
- You should just get some sleep if so.

29
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,979
Sleeping here overnight?

30
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:32,099
It's not a whole night.
Daylight is less than two hours away.

31
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,740
I was asking you to put down the cup.
You should fetch a new one for yourself.

I don't mind you used it.

My grandpa never drinks from a used cup.
I thought you were the same.

34
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,180
To others, yes.

35
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:30,699
I'll tell you a secret.

36
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:38,859

- Yes.

not to meet a beauty in the beginning.

Later, as your fame grew, I changed it.

43
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:28,860
You can change back now.

44
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,220
Now, the phrase is appropriate.

45
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,660
What if after I change it back,

46
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,100
we break up?

47
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,579
That would be even more embarrassing.

49
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,139

No, I'm not.

00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:23,860
Morning.

00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:27,540

The tea in the morning is different?

82
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:53,319
He specifically asked
what we drink here in the morning.

83
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:58,380
And I told him it was oil tea.
It was his idea to make it.

84
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,380
I guess he wanted you
to experience the authentic flavor.

85
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:11,619

- Don't mention it, Shengshengman.

91
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:57,060

96
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,380

97
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,619

102
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,660
- Be careful.
- Come again next time.

103
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,420
- Thank you.
- Thanks for your hard work. Let's go.

00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,939
Didn't they answer?

105
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:18,299
They've all slept through.
Let's go to the restaurant first.

106
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:20,579

some breakfast to their rooms.

were in charge.

108
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:29,380
Actually, you were taking care of
everyone behind the scenes.

109
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,020
- Time to get up. A plane to catch.
- It's too late. A plane to catch.

110
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,859
- Xiaoxing, Doudou, get up.
- Get up!

111
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:08,939
- What's going on?
- Get up!

112
00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:11,060
- We've got to catch the plane.
- My phone is gone!

113
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,260

115
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:19,340
Hurry up. Everyone, listen to me.
Wash up and eat breakfast here.

116
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,220
Then go back to your rooms to pack.

117
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,099
Only about half an hour for wash-up,
breakfast and pack-up.

118
00:12:25,099 --> 00:12:26,300
- Cheer up.
- Here.

119
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,540
Come back! If you don't brush your teeth,
no one will want you. Go.

120
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,939
- Hurry up.
- Wait for me.

121
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:34,979
- You're not washing up?
- I'll go back and wash up.

122
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:40,540
I will brush my teeth.

123
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,380
- Am I not brushing properly?
- Hurry up. We're going to be late.

124
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:50,540
- Steamed dumplings.
- I found my phone.

125
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,380
This is quite delicious.

126
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,180
This is tasty. Try it.

127
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:58,500
- Let me try.
- Look.

128
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:01,660
It's good!

129
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,579

132
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,819
- No osmanthus food anymore after this.
- I'm used to it.

133
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,539
- We should share that porridge.
- She must want one for herself.

134
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:30,200
She's my sister.
I'm close enough with her.

135
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,839
I won't share the porridge with you.
You didn't even brush your teeth well.

136
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:41,240
- I brushed my teeth and used mouthwash!
- You're so weird to do that.

137
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,600
- Pediatricians cares oral hygiene most.
- You are not a dentist.

138
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,219
Exactly.

Kids are easily to get cavities.

141
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,760
I remind them a lot,
so I got into the same habit.

142
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,632
Dental floss, brushing teeth,
and then mouthwash.

143
00:14:03,632 --> 00:14:06,540
Actually, I simplified it here.

144
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:11,540
I'm not sharing the porridge with you.
I'll have rice noodles.

145
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,420
- So reluctant to go back.
- We'll come back next time.

146
00:14:22,757 --> 00:14:25,420
(Airport)

147
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:27,819
We're leaving.

148
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:31,360
- Don't leave, you two.
- Forget it. I don't want you bothering.

149
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,380
- Right.
- Take care, Zhu.

- A big boss like you crying like that?
- We'll meet again someday.

156
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:06,219
- What are you doing?
- When I'm with you guys,

157
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,420
I feel like I'm back in my twenties.

158
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,260
I'll come to you
for a five-day luxury tour then.

159
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:22,919
- Fine. I'm worried that you won't come.
- Go ahead. I'll leave it here.

160
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,420

Don't forget the gifts.

167
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:49,380
Boss, you're so emotional.

168
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,420
We met before I got rich.

169
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:56,219
Even if I get to know other friends,

170
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,900
it won't be as close as to them.

171
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:05,420
Let's go.

172
00:16:16,052 --> 00:16:19,792
(Girl's Dorm Building 3)

173

It really feels like a dream.

174
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:40,600
Yeah, I finally understand why
people save money every year to travel.

175
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,699
It's like by being in a different place,
it'll be like in a dream.

176
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:56,944
(Library)

177
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,579
Sheng, can you help me check my paper?

178
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:19,619
What's wrong?

179
00:17:21,139 --> 00:17:27,472
The tutor said my writing is too vague.
If this version doesn't pass again,

180
00:17:27,472 --> 00:17:31,179
- I may be doomed.
- Let me take a look.

181
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:40,940
The theoretical analysis here
is too excessive.

182
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,400
For this section,
you should check some recent hot news

183
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,260
to substantiate your theory
with corresponding examples.

184
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,699
- As expected of you, Sheng. Carry on.
- Why don't you send it to me?

185
00:17:56,699 --> 00:18:00,176
I'll carefully review it tonight.
I can't find all the problems like this.

186
00:18:00,176 --> 00:18:03,339
- Okay. I'll look for some news first.
- Okay.

187
00:18:12,882 --> 00:18:13,300
(Linglong)

188
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,010
(The performance that day
was successful, congrats.)

189
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:21,360
(Last time, you said
you would consider it.)

190
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,080
(I still hope you can agree.
I am a qualified singer.)

191
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,210
(You're a promising composer.)

192
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,432
(I believe you won't be
disappointed collaborating with me.)

193
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:33,140
(Also, your voice is great.
If possible,)

194
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:39,339
(I hope we can collaborate,
not as harmonies but as a duet.)

195
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:48,179
Sheng.

196
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,099
Sheng.

197
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:53,780
Sheng.

198
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,139
What's wrong? You look so serious.

199
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,220
Linglong invited me to compose music.

200
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,740
Who? The rumored girlfriend of your man?

201
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,659
A love rival came for you?

202
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:16,780
What did she say?

203
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:24,784
She invited me to compose music.

204
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:28,579
She said she watched my live stream
and invited me for a duet.

205
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,819
Duet?

206
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,328
What's with that expression?
I told you because I want your advice.

207
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:46,819
This is for you to decide.
If you two cooperate,

208
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,980
I can imagine
what the netizens would say.

209
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:57,200
I'm also worried about that.
But from a professional perspective,

210
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,920
I think the opportunity
to cooperate with her is rare.

211
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,500
Indeed, she retired from the circle
as she was too busy with work years ago.

212
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,616
A talented singer with many supporters.

213
00:20:09,616 --> 00:20:11,659
Many wanted to work with her
but had no chance.

214
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,510
(How about this? I'll give it a try.
If we find it doesn't work,)

215
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,140
(we can terminate the contract
at any time.)

216
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,584
(I'll offer a song first
without pre-payment.)

217
00:20:33,584 --> 00:20:36,780
(Let's see if it's what you want.
We can discuss the rest later.)

218
00:20:39,176 --> 00:20:40,496
(Incoming call from Mo Qingcheng)

219
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:43,680
Linglong? You gave her your number?

220
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:50,460
No, Qiang Qingci and I are having lunch.
Collect the books for me. I'm leaving.

221
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,339
- No problem.
- Goodbye.

222
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:58,700
We should meet at twelve o'clock, right?
I'm still in the library.

223
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,980
Gu Sheng, this is Mo Bai speaking.

224
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,139
Hello.

225
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:13,540
Finally, I got to talk to you!
I've been begging Mr. Mo. I may cry.

226
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,820
We are currently filming
next to your school.

227
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,180
A girl broke her promise,
and hasn't showed up yet.

228
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:27,540
I am in a hurry to take pictures,
so can you take over for her?

229
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,759
- You want me to do a cosplay?
- Yes!

230
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,359
We will handle costume and makeup.
You don't have to worry about anything.

231
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:38,980
But I don't have any experience.
I'm afraid that I may fail you.

232
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:44,400
You just need to stand here.
You've got me and Mu, so rest assured.

233
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,719
- Mr. Mo will send you the location.
- Okay, I'll come over right away.

234
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:48,619
Goodbye.

235
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,660
- Sheng is here.
- Here to help. Very kind of her.

236
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,220
- Take a sip of milk tea first.
- When did you arrive?

237
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,150
I happen to have a seminar around here.

238
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,999
I was going to meet you at school
early for lunch before that.

239
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:03,279
I didn't expect a phone call from Mo Bai
would summon you over.

240
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:10,060
What? I begged you! Sheng is so kind!
She is always there when you need her.

241
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,819
You've got a good girlfriend.

242
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:17,320
- Shall we put on makeup first?
- Okay.

243
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:24,800
That's our makeup artist, Wang. Come.
This is Wang. And this is Gu.

244
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,140
- Hello.
- Hello.

245
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:31,984
You should take care of her makeup.
We don't have a dedicated make-up room.

246
00:23:31,984 --> 00:23:33,940
- Please bear with that.
- It's okay.

247
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,200
- Okay.
- Then let's go do the makeup first.

248
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,960
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

249
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,099
I'll be going then.

250
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:47,020
You're a model boyfriend,
always by her side.

251
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,020
Your skin is really nice,
just like Mu's.

252
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,920
Not as good as his.
He doesn't even have pores on his face.

253
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,870
I wonder how he has such good skin.

254
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:07,139
He doesn't seem to be a skin-care type.

255
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,359
You've followed me all the way here.

256
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,180
You said you would quit
and you wouldn't hang out with Yu!

257
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,700
Are we that familiar?

258
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,700
- You scum!
- Don't move. The mascara isn't dry yet.

259
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,340
- I am a scum.
- Okay.

260
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:30,020
That guy turned into a womaniser
soon after he had some fame, so lame.

261
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,479
I'm telling you,
we had a normal breakup.

262
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:35,500
- Scum.
- Scum.

263
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:38,659
They've come to blows.

264
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:59,460
- Are you okay? Did you get hurt?
- Who are you?

265
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,500
Hitting a little girl,

266
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,220
- do you even consider yourself a man?
- What's it to you?

267
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:22,640
Mu. So you two are in the same group?
Mu, you're something, aren't you?

268
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,920
Being senior and famous,
so you can bully people as you wish?

269
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,099
Are you blind? I did not hit you.
Call out to him if you dare!

270
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,960
- A man has hit a girl?
- I'll only curse at you.

271
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:42,820
What? Three of you beating me alone?
You're really something.

272
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,900
I bullied you, so what?

273
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:51,984
Don't come near me!
Don't you dare to touch me once!

274
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:55,680
If you lay a hand on me today,
I will post this online tomorrow.

275
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:01,060
Post the deed of our righteous rescue?
Or we bullied others with our power?

276
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:09,219
You really should consider
why you're being beaten today.

277
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:12,300
And I'll stay here with you
until you figure it out, alright?

278
00:26:18,339 --> 00:26:19,300
Wait for me.

279
00:26:28,099 --> 00:26:31,139
- Sorry, it was an emergency.
- Thank you.

280
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:35,519
Alright. Hurry back and start filming.
I'll treat everyone once we finish.

281
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:37,380
- Let's go.
- Go ahead.

282
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,740
Let's call a cab for her.
You go home first.

283
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:46,099
- I will take you down.
- We should go together. It's okay.

284
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:48,139
- Okay.
- Let's go.

285
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:50,419
- Go.
- I'll accompany them.

286
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:00,300
I suddenly have a good feeling
for the words "bullying by power".

287
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:04,020
Let's go.

288
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:14,020
That lady, lean your body to that side.
Okay. Three, two, one, get ready.

289
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,139
- Okay.
- Wait a moment.

290
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:20,220
Okay.

291
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:26,359
How about we have some interaction?
For example, you can put your hand here.

292
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:31,240
- Here?
- Right. Try act cute. Face the camera.

293
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,859
- Okay.
- Let's continue.

294
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:39,740
Good. Three, two, one, hold on.

295
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:45,539
- Wait a minute and we can interact.
- We can change positions.

296
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:48,940
- Everyone can adjust the poses.
- Just smile gently like this.

297
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,859
- Around the mouth?
- Right, just a slight smile.

298
00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:51,980
- Like this?
- Right.

299
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:56,859
Ready? Three, two, one.

300
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,700
The last one now.

301
00:28:04,339 --> 00:28:05,940
Alright everyone, let's wrap it up.

302
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,280
- Everyone has worked hard.
- Thank you for your hard word.

303
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,840
- Leave the props there and get changed.
- Fine.

304
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,520
- Let's go.
- Don't leave anything behind.

305
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:20,099
Thank you for your help today.
We'll get our clothes changed now.

306
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:20,960
- Okay.
- Let's go.

307
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,899
Your boyfriend is really handsome.

308
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:31,179
- Thank you.
- He would be a top star if he joins us.

309
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,300
No, he doesn't like
to be in the limelight.

310
00:28:38,379 --> 00:28:39,099
What a pity!

311
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:43,940
Follow me after putting down the props.
Makeup removers are in the make-up room.

312
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,419
- I also have makeup remover.
- Okay.

313
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:55,259
Make-up room will definitely be crowded.
I'll just go to the restroom downstairs.

314
00:28:55,259 --> 00:28:59,620
Fine, I have a sample of remover here.
Will it be enough?

315
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,480
- It's enough. Thank you.
- Then I'll go first.

316
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,700
- Okay.
- Thank you.

317
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,260
- Let's take the stairs down from here.
- Okay.

318
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:14,220
- How do you think of my performance?
- I think you were in a great state.

319
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,659
And Mu and the others
have been teaching you.

320
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:25,859
- Are you sure there are fewer people?
- Then we should go back upstairs.

321
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:26,619
Okay.

322
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,280
There are no more places
to get changed on other floors.

323
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:38,160
There should be some with many people
and I'm dressed like this.

324
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,423
At least we are dressed
the same up there.

325
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:46,060
- Let's wait for them finishing changing.
- Okay.

326
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,220
It's quite pretty.

327
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,540
I mean, you look really good like this.

328
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:11,780
- You were so handsome just now.
- Really?

329
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:16,060
That guy really deserved to be hit.
He was really annoying and infuriating.

330
00:30:18,379 --> 00:30:24,699
I originally thought
you were quite elegant.

331
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:27,179
I didn't expect
that you would also hit someone.

332
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:33,220
We can't just stand by
and watch that girl get hit, right?

333
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:38,379
I saw you getting hit
for others last time.

334
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,740
That time at the hospital entrance?

335
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:51,060
- Does that kind of thing happen often?
- It just so happened that time.

336
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:54,020
That's good.

337
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,899
Are you

338
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,500
worried about me?

339
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,379
Aren't you afraid

340
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:31,260
that I like your voice more
than I like you as a person?

341
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:36,419
Whatever part of me you like,

342
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:39,060
it's still me, right?

343
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,608
There is nothing wrong with that.

344
00:31:42,608 --> 00:31:47,579
At least, I have something
attractive to you.

345
00:33:15,819 --> 00:33:21,060
The lipstick is too thick,
and it's not good for your health.

346
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:23,980
But I'm okay with it.

347
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:29,179
Let's go upstairs.

348
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,500
This new bag I bought looks nice, right?

349
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,540
What's wrong?

350
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,699
It's clean?

351
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,820
Gu, you haven't removed makeup yet?
Did you eat something with lipstick on?

352
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,940
- It came off?
- It is not good for your health.

353
00:35:07,259 --> 00:35:10,679
But it's okay. The brands I used
are all plant-based.

354
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:13,860
- Next time you should pay attention.
- Okay.

355
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:19,120
Men's view of lipstick is limited.
Last time, I put on a colored lip balm.

356
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:26,240
My husband was too scared to kiss me
until I told him it's mango-flavored.

357
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,219
- So we should use couple's lipstick.
- You always have great ideas.

358
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:33,460
Gu Sheng is back.

359
00:35:35,179 --> 00:35:38,659
Did you not remove your makeup,
or just the lipstick?

360
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:49,099
The restroom downstairs was crowded,
so I got pushed out after a while.

361
00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:52,420
Aren't you supposed to have a seminar?
What time is it?

362
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:56,160
- It's about time.
- So, you're not eating then?

363
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,340
I was, but I'm here helping you out.
Everyone's hungry.

364
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:06,980
My bad. How about you go to the seminar
and Sheng joins us for a meal.

365
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,820
In the evening,
let's go to karaoke together afterwards.

366
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,619
You come over after the seminar?
Is that a good idea?

367
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,579
What do you want me to say?

368
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:25,240
- Do you have to work overtime tonight?
- I don't have to work overtime.

369
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:30,260
They're having one-on-one date today,
and you turned it into a party now.

370
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,779
Oh, look at me. I'm an idiot.

371
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,779
You've got to go?

372
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:43,259
- Then, will you go to the karaoke?
- Sure he will.

373
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:50,060
- If you go, I will be there.
- When does it end?

374
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,970
It will finish before it gets dark.

375
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:56,520
You know Mu and Mo Bai well.
Just feel free.

376
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:03,099
- Order whatever you want later.
- Haven't you found yourself annoying?

377
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,739
Didn't you say that everyone loves me?

378
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:12,860
- Then I'll wait for you.
- Okay.

379
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:17,800
- Then I'll leave Gu Sheng in your care.
- Okay.

380
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,540
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

381
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,880
- I'm leaving.
- Goodbye.

382
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,420
Goodbye.

383
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:25,919
Gu, let's get changed.

384
00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:27,840
- Okay.
- Let's go down and look for them.

385
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,860
- Go.
- Go.

386
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:33,420
- Everyone loves you?
- Hard to resist me! Got a problem?

387
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,219
- Anyone over there wants milk tea?
- Here.

388
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:40,299
- Come on.
- Here.

389
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:44,400
- Yes.
- Who drinks milk tea in a karaoke?

390
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,699
Do you think everyone is like you?

391
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,800
- Let's toast to your hard work.
- Thank you.

392
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,800
- Gu, you really resemble someone.
- Thank you.

393
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,199
- Really.
- Who is it?

394
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:59,020
- The 10th anniversary of Perfect Voice.
- That one!

395
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:02,260
- The one in ancient costume.
- The girl who sang harmony for Wang Ke.

396
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,299
- Shengshengman.
- Yes, Shengshengman.

397
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:09,979
- I thought I've seen you somewhere.
- Right, it really does.

398
00:38:09,979 --> 00:38:13,160
- So alike.
- It may be because of the long hair.

399
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,639
- No, it's not.
- Really?

400
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:19,800
What are you two talking about?
Go choose some songs. Hurry!

401
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,099
- I have a song to choose.
- Come on.

405
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,420
Quick, take a seat.

406
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,820
- You've been here for a while?
- Mr. Mo, what would you like to drink?

407
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,380
Here.

408
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,340
You were so handsome back then,
I'm telling you.

409
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,879
- I've chosen a lot of songs.
- What have you chosen?

410
00:38:46,879 --> 00:38:53,880
- "Bones to Sand" by Qiang Qingci.
- The first song he performed publicly.

411
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,750
He sang it in the live room
with Shengshengman there.

412
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,980
Shengshengman?
Isn't that a song for men?

413
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,779
- Yes.
- But they surely won't sing it well.

414
00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:07,140
- Do you want me to sing?
- Ask the young lady's boyfriend.

415
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:11,800
- You're likely to be discovered,
- How embarrassing.

- Exactly.

417

- Can you sing "Bones to Sand"?

418

- Yes.
- Can you sing that for us?

419

of a professional dubbing actor.

00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:18,579

- I should take good care of it.
