25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,703
(I'm so happy to pick you up from work)

26
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:04,499
Dad, didn't you go shopping?
Why are you back?

27
00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:21,259
You are...?

28
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,900
- Sir.
- Dr. Mo.

29
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:33,008
- Yes, I am.
- I finally remembered you.

30
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:35,420
You often shop at my supermarket, right?

31
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,860
My supermarket is right across
from the hospital where you work.

32
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,539
- Really? What a coincidence.
- I thought you looked familiar earlier,

33
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,420
but I couldn't recall your name,

34
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,219
- so I felt too shy to greet you.
- It's okay.

35
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:52,939
This is my daughter Sheng.
This gentleman is Dr. Mo.

36
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,300
- Sir, I remember now.
- Right?

37
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,420
- I've seen her in the supermarket.
- That's right.

38
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,020
She helps me out in the supermarket.

39
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,659
Hello, Sheng.

40
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,099
What are you staring at?
Say hello, really now.

41
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,219
H-H-Hello, Dr. Mo.

42
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:23,700
Sheng, you don't know
how excellent Dr. Mo is.

43
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,700
Those relatives of the patients,
who know Dr. Mo, all praise him to me.

44
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,060
How can this young man
be so outstanding?

45
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,180
- You flatter me, sir.
- It's your turn now.

46
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:35,780
Then...

47
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,659
- D-D-Dr. Mo, you first.
- Right.

48
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:42,580
- Okay, thank you.
- We have a lot of...

49
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,580
Dad, he's our customer. Your enthusiasm
would scare him off forever.

50
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,259
- He looks like me when I was young.
- Dad, aren't you going shopping?

51
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:53,780
- You're late and Mom may get angry.
- Yes. I'll go shopping now.

52
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,819
- Hurry and don't make your mom wait.
- You made me line up for nothing.

53
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,379
- Hurry up. Okay.
- Go.

54
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,779
- Dr. Mo, see you at the supermarket.
- Alright.

55
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:03,060
- Dad, bye.
- Alright. Bye.

56
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,420
You finished the shopping?

57
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,488
Just now, my dad's return
really scared me to death.

58
00:04:18,544 --> 00:04:19,420
Did I act well?

59
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,339
What about me? How was my assistance?

60
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,499
Take it.

61
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:30,928
- I said it was my treat.
- Next time then.

62
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,819
I'll probably be coming here often
from now on anyway.

63
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,220
Have it on the subway right away.
It's tastier when it's warm.

64
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,139
Thank you for coming to see me today.

65
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,100
Not at all. It's nothing.

66
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:53,060
Let's go. I'll walk you home.

67
00:04:54,499 --> 00:05:00,220
You're sick today. Go back to get rest.
And what if we run into my dad again?

68
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,499
Alright.

69
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,220
Where's the nearest subway station?

70
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:14,416
Keep going straight
and you'll get there in five minutes.

71
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:16,740
Shall I walk you there?

72
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:20,499
What if we run into your dad?

73
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,980
I'll be going then.

74
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:35,819
- Bye.
- Bye.

75
00:06:17,488 --> 00:06:18,899
Yummy when it's warm.

76
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:26,300
- Sheng isn't back yet?
- She said her classmate came.

77
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,819
She's just at the entrance of the alley.
Leave her there.

78
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:54,899
Sheng.

79
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,939
Why did you come back?

80
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:08,499
My...

81
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,568
My family won't mind if I go home late.

82
00:07:12,592 --> 00:07:15,499
I was afraid you couldn't find
the subway station, so I came back.

83
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,060
What about you? Why did you turn back?

84
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,139
I've got nothing else to do,
so I wanted to wander around here.

85
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:38,019
- Let me walk you to the station ahead.
- Great. You could also show me around.

86
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,100
Let's go.

87
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:44,816
I've never been down this street before.

88
00:07:45,872 --> 00:07:48,740
I used to run up and down this street
when I was a child.

89
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:13,019
- Sheng, have you had dinner yet?
- Yes, Mom, I have.

90
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,699
Your dad didn't tell you
I bought two big boxes?

91
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,060
He did.

92
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,632
I bought it for my classmate.
She didn't come, so I brought it back.

93
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,019
You glutton, you're still eating
after dinner. Eat less. I'm leaving.

94
00:08:57,099 --> 00:08:58,579
Well, I'd better keep it low-key.

95
00:08:59,344 --> 00:09:09,136
(Perfect Voice_Qiang Qingci)

96
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,420
(Is it good?)

97
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:25,540
(Very much so.)

98
00:09:25,872 --> 00:09:27,492
(Perfect Voice Studio)

99
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:30,640
- Hello, Mr. Feng.
- Mr. Feng, it's been a long time.

100
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,459
It's been so long.

101
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:41,979
- I haven't seen you for centuries.
- I had no choice. I've been too busy.

102
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:43,819
You're back. Long time no see.

103
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:50,000
- Even though we work in the same place.
- Pediatrics must be crazy busy lately.

104
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,020
It's especially easy to catch a cold
during winter, especially for children.

105
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,660
The two of you busy bees, get to work.

106
00:09:57,819 --> 00:10:01,659
- What work to do?
- We need to recruit two people.

107
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:06,220
Look at those with pentagrams on them.
They want to join our recording studio.

108
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,540
You're too ruthless. You're gonna put me
to work as soon as I get back?

109
00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:17,780
Back to the hospital later?

110
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,500
For the night shift, yes.

111
00:10:22,619 --> 00:10:26,880
It'll be the last one, I guess.
You can go back to work soon.

112
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,939
- Okay. Come on.
- Okay.

113
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:32,540
Xie Xiao.

114
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,140
H-H-Hello, my name is Xie Xiao,
and my nickname is Off Key.

115
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,219
The reason I applied is because of
an experience I had in my early years.

116
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:47,020
You know him?

117
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,459
- By a coincidence.
- I won't give him special treatment.

118
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:56,460
I won't either.

119
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:03,519
I'm not a local here. Since graduation,
I've done various jobs, like delivery.

120
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,820
My biggest money-maker was selling
lights outside a concert.

121
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,840
Ear lights. I particularly like
ancient-style songs.

122
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,600
Although I didn't have good grades,
I was good at Chinese when I was little.

123
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,720
I liked ancient texts and poems.
By chance, I joined a music club.

124
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,979
- I'm responsible for writing lyrics.
- We mainly focus on dubbing.

125
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,220
Then why did you choose us?

126
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,900
In addition to ancient-style songs,
I also like listening to audio dramas.

127
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:43,120
I've been learning dubbing.
I'm a big fan of your studio.

128
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,320
When Weibo just came out,
I started following this field and you.

129
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,500
So becoming a dubbing actor
has always been a dream of mine.

130
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:59,880
- But there are other dubbing clubs.
- I watched an interview with a veteran.

131
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:06,340
Our past lives are similar. Our parents
divorced and we grew up alone.

132
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,392
Alright, let's leave it here
for today. Thank you.

133
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:14,704
- My fan?
- I won't give him special treatment.

134
00:12:15,472 --> 00:12:17,979
Well, I might.

135
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,099
- No principles.
- But honest.

136
00:12:23,099 --> 00:12:24,459
Okay, let's check out his dubbing works.

137
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:43,060
Let me tell you a secret.

138
00:12:44,219 --> 00:12:48,099
- You bigmouth have secrets?
- This is something few people know.

139
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:54,140
A few days ago, I enrolled in a class
from the Perfect Voice Studio.

140
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,920
No wonder you're broke,
spending all your money on tuition fees?

141
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,260
This time, they are
hiring two official employees.

142
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,859
- Did you sign up?
- Of course.

143
00:13:04,859 --> 00:13:08,000
Being official staff
comes with salary and welfare.

144
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,899
Not to mention it's a good job, dubbing
has always been something I enjoy doing.

145
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:18,340
Once I nail this job,
we'll be walking the same path.

146
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:23,260
Good thing. It's a famous company.
The benefits must be good.

147
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,979
But it's uncertain
if they will consider you.

148
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,060
Who knows? Will I pass?

149
00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:36,699
What do you think?
How would you rate it?

150
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,099
Fair score or fan bonus?

151
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:47,380
Everyone on this list is your student.
I believe your score will be fair.

152
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,472
Alright, let's just rate it
and then look at the total score.

153
00:13:52,496 --> 00:13:56,300
Everyone has done it except us.
Later, let's have Doudou count up.

154
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:56,739
Okay.

155
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,000
Smells good.

156
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,296
- Isn't Qiang Qingci in that studio?
- Yes.

157
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:13,392
- You didn't tell Sheng, did you?
- No, I didn't.

158
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:19,660
- Better not, in case Mr. Mo overthinks.
- I won't. Mr. Mo is such a good person.

159
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,420
Let's not bother him.

160
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,000
Try not to mention Qiang Qingci
in front of Sheng anymore.

161
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,099
- Good boy.
- Nonsense.

162
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:39,039
If you are cold, just go in.
Don't make noise here.

163
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:44,080
- I'm waiting for you to count up.
- Rush? I'll give them to HR tomorrow.

164
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,959
Do it today. Finish today's work today.

165
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:50,739
It's past eight already.
Once I'm done counting, HR is off work.

166
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,260
He is indeed in a hurry.
Just hurry up and count it for him.

167
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:59,159
- His girlfriend is included?
- Of course not. I'm wholly unselfish.

168
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:02,339
I'm concerned about
the future talent situation of our team.

169
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:05,420
I'm going to the hospital soon,
so it would be a relief if it's settled.

170
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,140
Okay. I'll finish it for you.

171
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,540
So, the four of us are grading?

172
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,859
So, do you have any favorites?

173
00:15:21,099 --> 00:15:23,420
There are a few. The overall level
of this batch is not bad.

174
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:27,500
What about Zhou Zheng?
Does he have any favorites?

175
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,819
I don't know. I didn't ask.

176
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,060
Better not to ask.
Make the grading fair.

177
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:41,619
- Then have you noticed a certain...?
- Can you be quiet? I'm... 76?

178
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,500
Can you be quiet for a moment?
You made me have to recalculate it.

179
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,619
- Go ahead.
- All talk and no work.

180
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,339
- You didn't go to the night shift?
- Not yet. I will go soon.

181
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,500
Still here at this hour?

182
00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:09,500
Among our new trainees,
is there a fan of Feng Yasong?

183
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:17,459
Oh, right. He introduced himself
sincerely and was serious in the test.

184
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:22,959
When he was recalling his past,
it reminded me of our early days.

185
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,820
- Do you remember?
- How can I not?

186
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,880
I remember you guys put cotton
on the walls of my rented apartment

187
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,339
to make a recording room,
making me have no place to sleep.

188
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:33,660
You just slept all the time!
Did you even work?

189
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,700
Can you start calculating the scores?
I have to go on duty soon.

190
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,648
Doudou,

191
00:16:38,672 --> 00:16:42,720
he just wants to know
if his fan can be admitted.

192
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,939
Hurry up and calculate,
or he'll keep bothering you.

193
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:53,540
I see. Why didn't you tell me?
So pretentious.

194
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,800
Even if you don't want to exploit
your relationship, at least let her ask.

195
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,688
You've been in the anxious seat.

196
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:12,220
No, I must stick to my principles.

197
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,060
How should I make a wish?

198
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,740
I'd better check my horoscope.

199
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,260
That won't be detailed enough. I have
an astrologer friend. Want me to ask?

200
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:39,480
Okay. Tell me the precise birthdate
and city, right down to the minute.

201
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,940
Right down to the minute?
I would have to ask my grandmother.

202
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:46,700
Does it really need
to be down to the minute?

203
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,260
It is preferable,
or it won't be accurate.

204
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:57,859
Who is this? I don't know this number.

205
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,940
Hung up on me? A real character.

206
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,659
(Busy?)

207
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,819
(No. Being bored sitting at home,
I came to help my mom. And you?)

208
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:25,099
(There's an ad to record.)

209
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:27,379
(Keep it up.)

210
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:38,719
Asking for the birth time
is really troublesome.

211
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:43,780
How about I just fill in the birth date?
Does it have to be so precise?

212
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:46,619
I guess that would be fine.

213
00:18:47,088 --> 00:18:50,819
- The more precise, the more accurate.
- Hold on a second.

214
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,980
Hello, who is this?

215
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:03,099
Is this Xie Xiao receiving the call,
whose alias is Off Key?

216
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,899
Are you...?

217
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,992
- I'm Feng Yasong from Perfect Voice.
- Feng Yasong.

218
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,940
- Do you still need me?
- N-N-No.

219
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,680
A-A-Am I admitted? Or was I eliminated?

220
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,500
Please don't tell me
it's a consolation prize.

221
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,899
You are very amusing. You're not my fan
for nothing. You are accepted.

222
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:26,740
Really? Am I really admitted?

223
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,579
T-This is my first time talking to you.
I'm a bit excited right now.

224
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:33,700
A-A-Am I really going to be a part
of the Perfect Voice Studio?

225
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,940
Yes, from now on, you're one of us.

226
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:41,160
I know you're happy,
but I gotta hang up.

227
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,379
HR will call you tomorrow to tell you
the time for formalities on joining

228
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:49,039
and about the documents to bring
and subsequent matters.

229
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,940
Okay. I'll be waiting
for your message all day long.

230
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,940
Looking forward to meeting you.

231
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:04,900
- I can't hear anything.
- Our door is too soundproof.

232
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:11,079
Not bad. Congratulations on joining
the Perfect Voice Studio.

233
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:14,840
Let me calm down.
This feeling is too wonderful.

234
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,999
In one day, no, in one night,
I realized two of my wishes.

235
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:24,020
You have quite a lot of idols.
Qiang Qingci and Feng Yasong.

236
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,340
Qiang Qingci is everyone's idol,
but Feng Yasong is different.

237
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,480
He's the reason I'm into dubbing.
It's completely different.

238
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,180
On his resume, I saw "Zhaozhaomumu".

239
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,259
If I remember correctly, there is
no second "Zhaozhaomumu", right?

240
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:38,339
Yes, he is Sheng's friend.

241
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,940
That's why you were so concerned,
waiting for the results at this hour.

242
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,540
Aren't you going to tell her
that her friend is joining our studio?

243
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:53,740
I wanted to, but then I decided
to let her friend tell her.

244
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:57,738
(Wangjia Supermarket)

245
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:00,139
Welcome.

246
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:11,300
- Why are you here? Isn't there a shoot?
- I wanted to see you.

247
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:15,540
I should have let you accompany me
to the supermarket just now.

248
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:18,220
But it ended the same way.

249
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:22,780
What else did you eat
besides the meat moon cake tonight?

250
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,500
Nothing else. I've been busy
with the hiring affairs for the studio.

251
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:32,340
Then I'll get you something to eat.
This is fresh from home.

252
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,819
Let me make you some.
What do you like to eat?

253
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:43,019
I want radishes, winter bamboo shoots,
kelp knots, fish tofu and Qianye tofu.

254
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:47,479
These radishes were just cooked.
They might not be soft enough for you.

255
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:51,500
The bamboo shoots are just right.
Not too soft, not too hard. You try it.

256
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,379
I cooked them myself.

257
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:02,980
Get back to work.

258
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:28,339
It's good.

259
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,260
Welcome.

260
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,960
- Dr. Mo, you're here too!
- What a coincidence.

261
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,624
The Oden here is so good.
We have to fight for it every time.

262
00:22:41,712 --> 00:22:43,339
- Get me a serving too.
- Okay.

263
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:48,260
- What do you want?
- Same as his.

264
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,460
- You want everything he has?
- Yes.

265
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,160
- Done.
- Thanks. I'll pay when I'm done eating.

266
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,020
- Could you heat this up for me? Thanks.
- Okay.

267
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,419
- You're going to eat here?
- Yes. If I take it back, it'll be cold.

268
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,619
- I need to write a post-surgery report.
- Then you can go back.

269
00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:30,700
Seems like this radish
isn't cooked enough. What do you think?

270
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,740
It's just right for me.

271
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:38,980
- Do you like it soft?
- Yes.

272
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,139
Tell your mom to cook it
a bit longer next time.

273
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,540
Okay.

274
00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:54,940
- This fish tofu is good, very fresh.
- Yes. The one who cooked it is skilled.

275
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,819
Your meal is ready.

276
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,875
- I'll pay for the girl's meal as well.
- No need.

277
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,613
Don't be too polite to me.

278
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,339
- Do you need a receipt?
- No, thank you.

279
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,940
Well, I'll go back now.

280
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,859
- Goodbye, Dr. Mo.
- Goodbye.

281
00:24:25,379 --> 00:24:30,119
- I heard that you were sick today.
- Just a minor one.

282
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:35,139
Working overtime? But our department
was busy too. I only had one day off.

283
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,040
- I heard your dad became the dean.
- Yes.

284
00:24:41,808 --> 00:24:45,619
- Congrats! Shame he's not our dean.
- Thanks.

285
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:50,940
But you're hard to understand,
not going to your dad's hospital.

286
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,179
- It's easier under your father's wing.
- True.

287
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,940
This radish is pretty good.
I'd like more.

288
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:06,980
Why don't you come over and chat?

289
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,179
Someone else is here.
It would be bad if we got caught.

290
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:19,619
- Pay now or wait a bit?
- I want two yogurts before I pay.

291
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:26,780
I really think this radish is delicious.

292
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,899
- I'll head back, Dr. Mo.
- Alright.

293
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,980
Please come again.

294
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,419
Why isn't there any music playing
in the supermarket today?

295
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,220
What would you like to hear?

296
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:59,540
I listened to a song online recently
which is really popular.

297
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:01,179
Traditional-style.

298
00:26:03,139 --> 00:26:03,940
Dawn and Dusk.

299
00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:10,099
I'll search for it,
but no guarantees I can find it.

300
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,540
It's No. 1 on all major music charts.
It won't be too hard to find, right?

301
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:18,659
It was released on Valentine's Day.
The response is pretty good.

302
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,460

00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:15,899
Forget it. Check, please.
I'll come back tomorrow.

331
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,300
Go over there to shop. Let's go.

Please come again.

00:28:43,579 --> 00:28:45,780
Why didn't you agree? He's so handsome.

334
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,740
Work, it's work time.

335
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:52,260
If it were me, I would have agreed.

Make a right turn up ahead.

376
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:42,500
Almost there.

377
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:49,700
- Hold on a second.
- Hold on?

378
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:54,579
Wait for me a moment.

379
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,500
What's wrong?

380
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:06,899
No one. Let me take you to see my place.

381
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:08,940
Let's go.

382
00:32:25,139 --> 00:32:28,379
When do you plan to release that song?

383
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,859
Return With You?

384
00:32:33,139 --> 00:32:36,419
I think it's too high-profile.
I'm too shy to do it.

385
00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:45,020
- Which one is it?
- Here, this one right here.

386
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,160
Enter through that blue door,
and this is my house.

387
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,659
Sheng, is that you?

388
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,460
- It's me, brother.
- What are you doing there? Who's that?

389
00:33:00,819 --> 00:33:04,680
Right, this place. Keep going straight
and then turn right.

390
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,060
You'll see a row of doors. Look at
the door numbers and you'll know.

391
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:14,260
- Thank you, little girl.
- You're welcome, sir.

392
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,700
Sir?

393
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,700
Giving directions.

394
00:33:50,619 --> 00:33:51,420
Grandpa.

395
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,220
- You're back. Tired?
- No.

396
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,940
- Is the fruit ready, brother?
- Right away.

397
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,000
- What are you reading?
- Sheng, you're back.

398
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,520
The fridge is almost out of fruit,
so I bought some. Here, Grandpa.

399
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,500
Thank you, brother.

400
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:17,500
Sheng, what was
that person downstairs doing?

401
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,940
- Asking for directions.
- Asking for directions?

402
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:26,900
- Really?
- Yes, he was.

403
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,659
I feel like you two know
each other. Do you?

404
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,860
- We do.
- You do? How did you meet?

405
00:34:41,299 --> 00:34:42,219
Don't be nervous.

406
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,499
He's a doctor in the hospital
opposite to the supermarket.

407
00:34:47,499 --> 00:34:51,159
He said his girlfriend
lived in that alley.

408
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,940
It was his first time coming here,
so I just gave him some directions.

409
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,592
- His girlfriend lives here?
- Yes.

410
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,399
It wasn't an excuse
to talk to you, was it?

411
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:04,720
No, I'm not a great beauty.
Not everyone who sees me likes me.

412
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,240
Sheng, is he really a doctor?
Have you seen his work card?

413
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,339
Or maybe he said that
just to win your favor.

414
00:35:12,339 --> 00:35:16,259
Let me tell you, young men nowadays
are quite cunning.

415
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:21,100
You guys, as her brothers,

416
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:25,340
need to give your sister some freedom,
especially the freedom to make friends.

417
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:31,139
No, Grandpa, it's not like that.
The world has gotten very complicated.

418
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:35,600
We have only one girl in our family,
who is innocent and too trusting.

419
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,220
- We should look out for her, right?
- Right.

420
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,239
All I did was giving someone directions.

421
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:47,080
I think great love first lies
in fate and second in surprises.

422
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,180
Surprises?

423
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,020
My encounter with your grandma
was a surprise.

424
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:55,869
Come here.

425
00:35:55,869 --> 00:35:58,020
- Do you want to hear a story?
- Yes.

426
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:05,840
Your great uncle went to the army
for many years with no news about him.

427
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:11,180
Your grandma and he were very close.
She missed him a lot.

428
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,104
She kept missing him
until the hope dimmed.

429
00:36:14,128 --> 00:36:18,039
Suddenly one day, someone was shouting
her brother's name in an alley.

430
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:22,660
And a young man responded.
Your grandma ran out crying.

431
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:26,420
As it turned out, that young man
wasn't her brother,

432
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,179
but he had the same name.

433
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:34,379
Your grandma was so disappointed
and missed her brother so much.

434
00:36:34,379 --> 00:36:39,739
She hugged that man and cried so hard
that she couldn't be consoled.

435
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,380
The young man patiently
comforted your grandma.

436
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:48,739
He kept comforting her,
and at last, they got together.

437
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,240
And that young man was you.

438
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,500
- You believe in this destiny?
- It was an amazing coincidence.

439
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,179
Her brother's name
was exactly the same as mine.

440
00:36:59,179 --> 00:37:02,400
- That was quite a surprise.
- Indeed, it was quite a surprise.

441
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,219
But

442
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,980
her brother looked much better than me.

443
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,279
- No. Grandpa, you're the handsomest.
- Grandpa, you're too modest.

444
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:14,380
In my heart, you are the handsomest.

445
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:43,900
Sheng, you're still up?
Why is the light on?

446
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,680
You're up too? I couldn't sleep
and am gonna write songs. You go ahead.

447
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,460
- Hurry up and sleep early.
- I will lower the volume.

448
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,540
Mao.

449
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:56,340
You're a machine.
Straight to work after coming back?

450
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:59,220
I couldn't sleep, so I might as well
catch up on work left behind.

451
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,820
I'm okay. I'll go in.

452
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:14,460
The last time your girlfriend came,
I didn't dare to stare at her,

453
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,739
so I don't know what she looks like.
Do you have a picture?

454
00:39:18,096 --> 00:39:18,832
No, I don't.

455
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,659
Isn't she your girlfriend?

456
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:23,779
I felt awkward asking her.

457
00:39:26,779 --> 00:39:28,699
Do you have a picture together?

458
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:31,500
No, I don't.

459
00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:36,140
Actually, we haven't met
many times in person.

460
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,900
I thought Zhou Zheng
and others were joking with me.

461
00:39:40,259 --> 00:39:42,139
So, that is an online relationship?

462
00:39:44,739 --> 00:39:45,579
I guess so.

463
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:53,300
I'll tell you a secret. My wife and I
started our relationship online too.

464
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:57,000
We met when playing games,
and only after more than a year

465
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,060
did we video call each other.
I was so nervous before the call.

466
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:04,980
I just hoped,
no matter what she looked like,

467
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:11,380
as long as she wasn't my mother's age.
After all, we had had a thing going.

468
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,820
But in the end, you got your wish.

469
00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:21,259
I did. I was ecstatic.

470
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:25,860
Enough. Let's not deviate anymore.
It's work time now.

471
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,959
Come and check out this ad.

472
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:31,200
Today, there are two versions,
15 seconds and 30 seconds.

473
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,760
The narration length varies as well.

474
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,419
First, let's get the shorter one done.

475
00:40:35,419 --> 00:40:38,020
I'll take a brief look.

476
00:40:41,779 --> 00:40:44,120
Can we change this part?
It's a bit of a tongue twister.

477
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,999
Isn't this a bit too formal
for an ad script?

478
00:40:47,999 --> 00:40:50,080
Will the brand representatives
come to confirm the recording?

479
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,320
You've worked with them for years.
There won't be any problems, I guess.

480
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,060
They did mention before
that if any problems arose

481
00:40:55,472 --> 00:40:58,300
during the recording,
we could give them a call.

482
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:02,240
We can just play it to them by phone.
They won't come personally.

483
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,219
Mao, let's do a trial run
and see how we can improve it.

484
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,420
(I'll be at the supermarket tomorrow.)

485
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,619
Aren't we meeting
too frequently these days?

486
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,460
(Just finished up,
off to sleep. Goodnight.)

487
00:41:45,779 --> 00:41:46,219
(Goodnight.)

488
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:51,460
(Do you want a pre-sleep call?)

489
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:09,460
(No. You had a fever today
and kept working. You should sleep.)

490
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:12,540
(Alright.)

491
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,699
(I'll be at the supermarket tomorrow.
You can see me anytime.)

492
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:21,904
(Okay, goodnight.)

493
00:42:22,992 --> 00:42:26,659
(Period this time.
No replying and go to sleep right away.)

494
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:20,540
Mom.

495
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,560
It's weekend.
You're not having a lie in today?

496
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,060
- I'll watch the supermarket for you.
- Watching the supermarket for me?

497
00:43:32,299 --> 00:43:33,500
