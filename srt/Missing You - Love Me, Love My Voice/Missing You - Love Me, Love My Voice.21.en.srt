25
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:46,096
(Mom, this is my boyfriend.)

26
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,600
(He prefers sleeping
on a firm mattress.)

27
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,936
(He must be asleep now.
But it's soundproof here.)

28
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,077
(Even if he's not asleep,
he can't hear anything.)

29
00:03:02,677 --> 00:03:04,957
(I can't sleep at all.)

30
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:32,316
It smells good.

31
00:03:43,476 --> 00:03:44,077
What's up?

32
00:04:22,037 --> 00:04:25,196
- Go.
- Go where at this late hour?

33
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:28,357
Go find the red cloth.

34
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:30,396
Go.

35
00:05:23,237 --> 00:05:24,276
(Can I come back?)

36
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:28,357
(Okay.)

37
00:05:45,717 --> 00:05:50,196
Juemei is a loud sleeper,
and he kicks people, so I came back.

38
00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:54,836
Just keep sleeping.
I'll sleep on the sofa.

39
00:06:12,357 --> 00:06:12,876
Go to sleep.

40
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:25,968
How about you sleep on the bed
and I'll sleep on the sofa?

41
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:29,187
You have an early shift tomorrow.
Sleeping on the sofa can be tiring.

42
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,557
It's okay. Go to sleep.

43
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:58,237
Good night.

44
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:00,756
Good night.

45
00:07:22,516 --> 00:07:24,717
(How can I fall asleep now?)

46
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:11,152
(Alarm clock)

47
00:08:19,516 --> 00:08:20,157
You're awake.

48
00:08:21,677 --> 00:08:24,597
- Morning.
- It's early, only 7 AM.

49
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:28,357
Isn't it a weekend? You can sleep in.

50
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:32,357
I want to have breakfast
with you. Let me cook it.

51
00:08:33,357 --> 00:08:34,036
Cook what?

52
00:08:35,477 --> 00:08:36,516
I'll figure it out as I cook.

53
00:08:37,957 --> 00:08:40,368
You don't need to. Continue sleeping.

54
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:42,597
I'll buy some on the way
or at your supermarket.

55
00:08:43,077 --> 00:08:45,916
Are you going to get changed?
I will go to the bathroom to change.

56
00:09:21,197 --> 00:09:24,437
Sheng, did we wake you up?

57
00:09:26,396 --> 00:09:28,676
Make yourself at home.

58
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:32,997
Sorry, we didn't know
you were staying here yesterday.

59
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,906
We worked all night yesterday

60
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:36,717
- and came here for a nap.
- Right.

61
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:41,036
We didn't mean
to interrupt your couple time.

62
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,717
Next time when both of you come,
notify us in advance. Did you hear?

63
00:09:45,237 --> 00:09:49,077
Mr. Mo has a girlfriend now.
Only Sheng can sleep in his bed.

64
00:09:50,276 --> 00:09:51,756
The thing is different now.

65
00:09:55,516 --> 00:09:56,477
It's fine. Don't mind them.

66
00:09:57,636 --> 00:09:59,636
You get changed in the room.
I'll change in the bathroom

67
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:15,477
(We did nothing,
but why do I feel so guilty?)

68
00:10:21,516 --> 00:10:23,516
Mr. Mo, it wasn't intentional.

69
00:10:24,717 --> 00:10:26,876
Mr. Mo, I really didn't know.

70
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:31,477
Well...

71
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,796
- Angry?
- It's not that serious.

72
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,504
I told you two not to come
but you insisted.

73
00:10:39,696 --> 00:10:42,156
See? Suffering for
not listening to my advice.

74
00:10:42,717 --> 00:10:44,036
- Come with me to my room.
- Okay.

75
00:10:45,357 --> 00:10:47,676
What are you doing? Don't bring this.
You can't eat in my room.

76
00:10:47,676 --> 00:10:51,516
Stop. You'll spill it,
and the smell will be all over.

77
00:10:55,876 --> 00:10:59,516
Stop it. I just had a few bites.
Don't mess around with me.

78
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,796
Don't sit here. Go eat there.

79
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:09,276
Eat while standing.
Don't eat on the bed.

80
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:10,837
It'll stain the bed.

81
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,636
Fine. Truly no place to stay here.

82
00:11:18,516 --> 00:11:22,117
Do you think
we spoiled their couple time?

83
00:11:22,676 --> 00:11:25,796
Sheng looked quite embarrassed anyway.

84
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:28,237
We were just in the living room.

85
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:31,477
Juemei, we didn't
spoil their couple time, right?

86
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:43,997
Given Mr. Qiang's pace in their romance,
we'll soon lose this stronghold.

87
00:11:45,117 --> 00:11:48,197
How about my place? I have a big room,
and I'm single. You can do anything.

88
00:11:48,597 --> 00:11:51,477
Oh, come on. Don't you know
how far your place is?

89
00:11:51,597 --> 00:11:54,837
It's over 20 stops away on the subway,
and you can even jungle.

90
00:11:54,957 --> 00:11:56,156
- Don't come in the future.
- I...

91
00:11:56,357 --> 00:12:00,197
- That's because he coupled up so fast.
- Right.

92
00:12:02,516 --> 00:12:07,597
And Mr. Zhou too. I guess we won't
even be able to stay in this room.

93
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,036
No friends.

94
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:11,997
You two,

95
00:12:13,556 --> 00:12:18,516
only capable of messing things up.
Just stay put and cut the chatter.

96
00:12:23,237 --> 00:12:27,117
- I need to go to the bathroom.
- Stop talking. You made me feel it too.

97
00:12:27,117 --> 00:12:30,756
- Let's go.
- Hold it right there. Hold it.

98
00:12:33,237 --> 00:12:37,117
- Holding it is not good, right?
- Can't you wait till those two leave?

99
00:12:39,437 --> 00:12:42,876
Look, our status in the group.
Oh, my goodness.

100
00:12:43,077 --> 00:12:46,727
Stop talking. Now singers
can't compete with vocal actors.

101
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,317
It's no big deal.
I'll learn it too later.

102
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:52,997
- Go find the red cloth.
- General, no!

103
00:12:53,717 --> 00:12:56,197
Your feelings are not strong enough.
You don't have a runny nose.

104
00:12:56,477 --> 00:13:00,717
Whenever I get emotional, all I have
is a runny nose. Just a runny nose.

105
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:03,796
- Come on.
- Don't.

106
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,036
- I'll take you to find the red cloth.
- General, no!

107
00:13:06,437 --> 00:13:09,036
- Do you still want the red cloth?
- Hold it.

108
00:13:15,276 --> 00:13:16,916
No one's in the living room.
You can wash up.

109
00:13:22,756 --> 00:13:26,437
- You want the red cloth?
- My arm. It hurts.

110
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:27,916
- Still want the red cloth?
- Be gentle.

111
00:13:29,077 --> 00:13:31,597
- Don't you want to find the red cloth?
- Not anymore. My mistake.

112
00:13:39,597 --> 00:13:41,036
What should I do about this?

113
00:13:42,676 --> 00:13:43,396
What?

114
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,916
I used this new towel.

115
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:49,117
Should I take this away?

116
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:51,997
If it's taken away,
what will you use next time?

117
00:13:55,437 --> 00:13:58,876
- I'll make the bed. I slept on it.
- No need. It's no trouble.

118
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:07,717
(Wangjia Supermarket)

119
00:14:07,717 --> 00:14:09,997
- Please come again.
- Thank you for visiting.

120
00:14:10,237 --> 00:14:11,317
Please come again.

121
00:14:21,636 --> 00:14:24,916
Sorry, we didn't know
you were staying here yesterday.

122
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:26,706
We worked all night yesterday

123
00:14:26,706 --> 00:14:28,437
- and came here for a nap.
- Right.

124
00:14:28,516 --> 00:14:32,796
We didn't mean
to interrupt your couple time.

125
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:50,756
You failed the exam?

126
00:14:52,957 --> 00:14:53,556
No.

127
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,556
Then why do you look exactly
like I did when I failed the exam?

128
00:14:59,676 --> 00:15:04,717
Wait, you failed the exam? Really?
It's the last semester, and which exam?

129
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:09,077
No, I haven't failed any exams.
Go back to eat your noodles.

130
00:15:10,197 --> 00:15:12,036
You hear that? She didn't.
Stop talking nonsense.

131
00:15:14,077 --> 00:15:14,636
What's wrong?

132
00:15:27,396 --> 00:15:33,756
(Sheng, I've listened and felt touched.
I have many suggestions for revision.)

133
00:15:34,437 --> 00:15:37,756
(I'm leaving tomorrow. If you're free,
can we meet tonight,)

134
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:41,317
(so we won't fall behind schedule?)

135
00:15:43,036 --> 00:15:45,117
(Meeting tonight?)

136
00:15:46,357 --> 00:15:50,556
(How does she know I'm in this city?
I don't even know where she's from.)

137
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:55,837
(I'm in the hospital where Mo Qingcheng
works. You must have been here.)

138
00:16:05,317 --> 00:16:06,036
What a coincidence.

139
00:16:07,036 --> 00:16:13,357
(I'm at the supermarket opposite.
If it's okay with you, we can meet now.)

140
00:16:13,676 --> 00:16:20,477
(Tell me where you are and I'll come,
or we can meet outside the hospital.)

141
00:16:26,516 --> 00:16:30,516
(You can come because I'm not sure
if I can go out now.)

142
00:16:38,117 --> 00:16:41,488
(Okay, I'll come over.)

143
00:16:41,488 --> 00:16:47,357
(Tell me the floor number. I'll probably
arrive in about ten minutes.)

144
00:16:47,357 --> 00:16:48,876
(Second floor, main building.)

145
00:16:50,556 --> 00:16:50,957
(Okay.)

146
00:16:56,077 --> 00:16:59,317
Gu Jia, I have to go out.
I'll be back in about a half hour.

147
00:16:59,676 --> 00:17:00,816
Okay, hurry back.

148
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:02,756
Your mom isn't here today.
She can't take over my shift.

149
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:04,516
I can only go out after you come back.

150
00:17:09,957 --> 00:17:12,796
I strongly suspect she failed the exam.

151
00:17:13,276 --> 00:17:15,877
Stop your analysis.

152

155

Sheng, hello, I am Linglong.

156
00:18:14,237 --> 00:18:15,437
Let's go there and sit.

157
00:18:17,237 --> 00:18:18,796
I am an obstetrician working here.

158
00:18:20,796 --> 00:18:21,356
Please, sit.

159
00:18:27,637 --> 00:18:32,197
Hello, I am Shengshengman.
I thought you came to see a doctor.

160
00:18:32,677 --> 00:18:34,556
Turns out that you're a doctor
at this hospital.

161
00:18:35,076 --> 00:18:39,397
So I'm very busy and can only record
after work, just like Mo Qingcheng.

162
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:47,356
We have many doctors in our family.
Mr. Mo is just one of them.

163
00:18:48,556 --> 00:18:49,997
Your family?

164
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:52,197
We are relatives.

165
00:18:54,677 --> 00:18:56,957
I am his cousin. Surprising, isn't it?

166
00:19:00,437 --> 00:19:04,437
No, the people around him
have never mentioned it.

167
00:19:05,717 --> 00:19:11,036
My cousin and I agreed long ago
not to reveal our kinship in the circle.

168
00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:15,477
As he became more and more famous,
he was even less likely to mention it.

169
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:19,516
But Juemei knows that I'm his cousin.
Didn't he tell you?

170
00:19:22,437 --> 00:19:23,076
No, he didn't.

171
00:19:25,717 --> 00:19:27,597
(Juemei has gone too far.)

172
00:19:27,597 --> 00:19:30,516
(He didn't tell me and
he even caused misunderstandings.)

173
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:35,516
(Saying Linglong was secretly in love
with him but she was actually a cousin.)

174
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:37,957
Why are you so happy about it?

175
00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:40,397
No.

176
00:19:44,477 --> 00:19:48,836
Did you ask me to write a song due to
my relationship with Mo Qingcheng?

177
00:19:48,957 --> 00:19:52,477
How could that be possible?
I would not mess with my own album.

178
00:19:53,237 --> 00:19:58,997
I value this album a lot. It's kind
of a memento of my time in this circle.

179
00:20:01,197 --> 00:20:02,516
Dr. Mo, let's go eat.

180
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:04,176
You go ahead. My friend came.

181
00:20:04,176 --> 00:20:05,316
- We'll chat for a while.
- Okay.

182
00:20:06,717 --> 00:20:10,596
A few years ago, when I heard your song,
I wanted to ask you to write a song.

183
00:20:11,116 --> 00:20:14,836
But I was really too busy
and had no time.

184
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:17,796
Fortunately,
you are still in this circle now.

185
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:24,176
Back then, I wasn't really
part of the circle yet.

186
00:20:24,176 --> 00:20:27,276
I just occasionally
helped out my classmates,

187
00:20:27,276 --> 00:20:30,036
unaware of
this traditional music circle.

188
00:20:30,157 --> 00:20:32,957
Later on, as I delved deeper,
I began to get a feel for it.

189
00:20:33,836 --> 00:20:35,076
I want to ask you a question.

190
00:20:36,237 --> 00:20:40,397
A few years ago, when I was preparing
an album, did you send me a demo?

191
00:20:41,596 --> 00:20:43,877
- You knew it?
- Yeah.

192
00:20:44,197 --> 00:20:47,677
But back then, it seems I wasn't using
the name Shengshengman.

193
00:20:47,717 --> 00:20:49,397
But I remember your voice.

194
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:55,796
It was really a pity. I remember
when I heard your demo,

195
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:58,480
I thought it was amazing

196
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,957
and that the girl was talented
in both songwriting and composing

197
00:21:02,076 --> 00:21:03,876
and her singing was melodious.

198
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:07,356
But, I put my album on hold later on
and didn't contact you.

199
00:21:07,997 --> 00:21:12,237
Just casual humming. I didn't expect you
to still remember it after so long.

200
00:21:13,596 --> 00:21:14,197
Hold on.

201
00:21:17,637 --> 00:21:18,157
Hello.

202
00:21:20,877 --> 00:21:23,276
Your girlfriend is here with me.
Do you want to come down and see her?

203
00:21:27,596 --> 00:21:29,876
My cousin is coming. He's just off work.

204
00:21:29,876 --> 00:21:33,316
We'll wrap up our chat shortly.
Then you two can go on a date.

205
00:21:34,397 --> 00:21:38,957
Okay, let's talk about that song first.
I will definitely work hard.

206
00:21:39,917 --> 00:21:42,356
- Let me show you first.
- Okay.

207
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:44,796
We need to discuss this part
of the tune again.

208
00:21:45,397 --> 00:21:49,556
This is how it is here now.
And this final part is like this.

209
00:21:50,997 --> 00:21:54,796
- It's almost like this. This part...
- Sheng.

210
00:22:05,397 --> 00:22:07,596
So you met Sheng
before you continued your studies.

211
00:22:07,796 --> 00:22:11,397
Yeah. You hid her so well.
I had to take the initiative.

212
00:22:17,116 --> 00:22:18,356
You just agreed to meet her easily?

213
00:22:20,276 --> 00:22:24,677
- It's cooperation. I need to cooperate.
- But what if she is a bad person?

214
00:22:24,836 --> 00:22:29,316
Nonsense. Sheng isn't stupid. And it is
in the hospital. What could happen?

215
00:22:30,276 --> 00:22:33,756
Right, I don't just meet
anyone casually.

216
00:22:35,957 --> 00:22:40,836
Everyone online recognizes your cousin
is a good person, so I agreed to meet.

217
00:22:41,076 --> 00:22:42,992
You side with her.

218
00:22:42,992 --> 00:22:45,556
She'd been eager to meet you,
and I'd been preventing it for you.

219
00:22:46,197 --> 00:22:48,397
What's the point of hiding her?
I'd see her sooner or later.

220
00:22:49,717 --> 00:22:53,596
We've finished. You can go on your date.
I have to fly tomorrow.

221
00:22:53,717 --> 00:22:57,087
My handover hasn't been finished,
so I won't join you for dinner.

222
00:22:57,087 --> 00:22:58,437
I'll see you two downstairs.

223
00:22:59,756 --> 00:23:01,356
Let's have a good talk when I come back.

224
00:23:01,637 --> 00:23:02,796
- Okay.
- Let's go.

225
00:23:07,796 --> 00:23:09,637
Dr. Mo, could you please sign here?

226
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:14,516
They say during the check-up, we can see
the baby's hands and feet. So fun.

227
00:23:14,637 --> 00:23:16,036
Look how happy you are.

228
00:23:17,957 --> 00:23:19,116
Sister, look.

229
00:23:22,076 --> 00:23:24,917
How come Sheng ended up in here?

230
00:23:28,516 --> 00:23:31,637
Okay, got it.

231
00:23:41,076 --> 00:23:43,237
What's the matter? What did you see?

232
00:23:44,997 --> 00:23:47,477
My mom.

233
00:23:53,836 --> 00:23:56,976
(Mom, please don't overthink it.)

234
00:23:56,976 --> 00:24:01,796
(I'm just here to talk to the cousin
of my boyfriend about the arrangement.)

235
00:24:03,477 --> 00:24:06,076
I'll step aside for a moment.

236
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:13,237
- Well, you should introduce me to them.
- Are you serious?

237
00:24:13,556 --> 00:24:16,477
- Yes.
- How weird it is to do it here?

238
00:24:19,276 --> 00:24:22,197
Do you think we can get through this
without explaining clearly?

239
00:24:27,957 --> 00:24:29,076
- Mom.
- Hello.

240
00:24:31,276 --> 00:24:33,197
- Auntie.
- Hello.

241
00:24:36,157 --> 00:24:36,877
This...

242
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:40,677
This is my boyfriend.

243
00:24:43,677 --> 00:24:45,677
Hello. My name is Mo Qingcheng.

244
00:24:49,316 --> 00:24:49,836
Hello.

245
00:24:53,356 --> 00:24:54,477
What are you doing here?

246
00:24:57,877 --> 00:24:58,516
I...

247
00:25:00,556 --> 00:25:04,076
Let me explain. There might be
some misunderstanding.

248
00:25:05,717 --> 00:25:07,276
I am a doctor at this hospital.

249
00:25:08,316 --> 00:25:12,076
Sheng came here to discuss a composition
with my cousin,

250
00:25:13,076 --> 00:25:14,957
who is a doctor at this hospital too.

251
00:25:15,957 --> 00:25:20,036
She's in obstetrics and gynecology,
that's why we are here.

252
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:26,796
You are in obstetrics
and gynecology too?

253
00:25:27,836 --> 00:25:30,197
No, I'm not.
I'm in cardiac surgery, upstairs.

254
00:25:33,836 --> 00:25:35,717
- Is what he said true?
- Yes, it's true.

255
00:25:52,116 --> 00:25:53,756
It almost scared me to death.

256
00:25:57,157 --> 00:26:01,237
- I knew Sheng wouldn't do such a thing.
- Sister.

257
00:26:02,197 --> 00:26:06,157
- Sorry, I'm Sheng's mother.
- Hello.

258
00:26:07,637 --> 00:26:09,008
This is Sheng's aunt,

259
00:26:09,008 --> 00:26:11,718
and I came to accompany her
for the prenatal examination.

260
00:26:11,718 --> 00:26:12,836
You can call her Auntie.

261
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:16,556
- Auntie, nice to meet you.
- Good.

262
00:26:18,237 --> 00:26:23,197
Hello, I am his cousin
and an obstetrician working here.

263
00:26:24,276 --> 00:26:28,316
Should I call her sister or...

264
00:26:30,637 --> 00:26:32,917
- Sheng's auntie.
- Yes, Sheng's auntie.

265
00:26:34,036 --> 00:26:38,276
Right, you all should follow Sheng
and call me Auntie,

266
00:26:38,477 --> 00:26:41,516
- though I'm younger than my sister.
- 11 years younger.

267
00:26:43,717 --> 00:26:45,488
I'll call you Auntie. Auntie, sorry.

268
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:49,917
I have to leave tomorrow for study,
so I won't be able to take care of you.

269
00:26:50,036 --> 00:26:53,276
But I can recommend
a very experienced doctor.

270
00:26:55,076 --> 00:27:00,157
No need. That would be too troublesome.
I always see Dr. Zhao.

271
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:03,056
Dr. Zhao is highly skilled.

272
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:05,232
His appointment slots
are always booked up.

273
00:27:05,232 --> 00:27:06,640
With him around, you can be at ease.

274
00:27:07,076 --> 00:27:11,116
- Right.
- (Gu Lili, please come to Room 5.)

275
00:27:11,116 --> 00:27:15,276
- They're calling for you.
- Right, I almost forgot it.

276
00:27:15,276 --> 00:27:16,917
Right, I need to go in for the check-up.

277
00:27:18,796 --> 00:27:19,437
Mo Qingcheng.

278
00:27:20,877 --> 00:27:25,116
- It's better to call you Dr. Mo here.
- Right.

279
00:27:25,116 --> 00:27:30,160
I'll leave you guys to chat. After all,
in the future, we'll be family.

280
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,877
- I'll enter the room.
- I'll accompany you.

281
00:27:32,877 --> 00:27:34,237
- No need.
- I'll accompany you.

282
00:27:34,717 --> 00:27:38,356
Thank you very much.

283
00:27:45,036 --> 00:27:48,596
Mrs. Gu. The prenatal check-up
will take some time.

284
00:27:48,596 --> 00:27:53,437
- How about going to the cafe here?
- Sounds good. We'll listen to you here.

285
00:27:55,477 --> 00:27:56,717
- This way, please.
- Okay.

286
00:27:59,237 --> 00:28:00,016
Mom.

287
00:28:00,976 --> 00:28:04,656
It's a good thing to have a boyfriend.
Why didn't you tell me?

288
00:28:04,656 --> 00:28:05,596
Let's go.

289
00:28:06,997 --> 00:28:08,917
Hello, table for three.
We'd like a pot of flower tea.

290
00:28:08,957 --> 00:28:10,637
- Just a moment.
- Okay, thank you.

291
00:28:14,036 --> 00:28:14,756
Please take a seat.

292
00:28:15,836 --> 00:28:16,677
Nice environment.

293
00:28:31,637 --> 00:28:32,756
Why are you sitting on this side?

294
00:28:34,957 --> 00:28:35,556
I'm used to it.

295
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:39,796
Sheng is feeling shy.

296
00:28:42,316 --> 00:28:44,917
Right, accompanying us
won't interfere with your work, right?

297
00:28:45,116 --> 00:28:47,088
It won't. I'm off work.

298
00:28:47,376 --> 00:28:49,936
I need to go to the branch hospital
this afternoon for an outpatient service.

299
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,076
- Okay.
- Hello, your tea is ready.

300
00:28:53,596 --> 00:28:54,116
Thank you.

301
00:29:01,356 --> 00:29:03,197
- Your tea.
- Okay.

302
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:12,276
Mom, have some tea.

303
00:29:13,356 --> 00:29:15,116
That's enough. Stop staring.

304
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:18,477
What's wrong with
staring when we first meet?

305
00:29:20,116 --> 00:29:22,596
A couple of glances
should be enough, right?

306
00:29:23,836 --> 00:29:25,796
He doesn't mind. Why do you mind it?

307
00:29:29,917 --> 00:29:33,756
- Is your home far from the hospital?
- It's near the hospital.

308
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:37,917
- Yeah, you doctors are quite busy.
(- Geng Xiaoxing: Your mom met Qiang Qingci?)

309
00:29:37,997 --> 00:29:40,637
- It's better to live nearby.
- Yes, it's better.

310
00:29:40,677 --> 00:29:43,836
- Are your parents locals?
- Yes, and they're both doctors.

311
00:29:43,957 --> 00:29:45,717
- Really? They're both doctors?
- Yes.

312
00:29:47,237 --> 00:29:49,397
- That's great.
(- How do you know?)

313
00:29:49,397 --> 00:29:51,556
- Are you an only child?
(- Wang Ke.)

314
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:54,957
- I'm the only one in my family.
- Really? So is Sheng.

315
00:29:57,835 --> 00:29:58,960
(Wang Ke on speakerphone)

316
00:29:59,717 --> 00:30:01,877
Describe the specific situation.

317
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:10,116
Calm, composed,
and a polite and mild smile.

318
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,437
I'm asking about their conversation.

319
00:30:13,717 --> 00:30:17,316
I can't hear what they're saying.
They'll see me if I get too close.

320
00:30:18,756 --> 00:30:21,756
Mom, stop asking. Why so many questions?

321
00:30:22,877 --> 00:30:24,957
You don't tell me, and I can't ask?

322
00:30:25,076 --> 00:30:28,356
But I feel his future mother-in-law
seems quite satisfied.

323
00:30:30,516 --> 00:30:32,637
(Sheng, Wang Ke is peeking at us.)

324
00:30:32,756 --> 00:30:35,756
Mrs. Gu, I'll go make a call
about the outpatient arrangement.

325
00:30:36,316 --> 00:30:38,076
- Okay, you go ahead.
- Okay.

326
00:30:40,477 --> 00:30:43,116
Mr. Mo is up.
He's probably going to the reception.

327
00:30:48,957 --> 00:30:52,316
But I'm sure there's a bit of acting
on Mr. Mo's part.

328
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,516
Who wouldn't be nervous

329
00:30:53,516 --> 00:30:55,397
- when meeting the future mother-in-law?
- Acting?

330
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:56,157
He must be.

331
00:30:57,477 --> 00:31:01,207
Handling everything doesn't mean
handling meeting the MIL.

332
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:04,437
Mr. Mo is a human
and also has moments of weakness.

333
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:06,347
Don't look down on him.

334
00:31:06,347 --> 00:31:07,952
When it's your turn,
you might not do as well as him.

335
00:31:08,048 --> 00:31:08,756
Right.

336
00:31:10,437 --> 00:31:11,467
Where is he?

337
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:14,717
The young man is not bad.
Why didn't you show him to me earlier?

338
00:31:17,756 --> 00:31:20,356
Mr. Mo, what a coincidence!
You're at work?

339
00:31:20,917 --> 00:31:23,836
- He's caught!
- He's caught. Hurry.

340
00:31:23,997 --> 00:31:25,027
Why are you here?

341
00:31:25,027 --> 00:31:28,116
I'm having trouble with my eyes.
I came to check them out.

342
00:31:28,677 --> 00:31:31,836
- Your eyes?
- No, I...

343
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:39,376
- I think they're fine. You see clearly.
- Really?

344
00:31:39,376 --> 00:31:43,677
It hurts badly. My eyes are quite big,
so they easily get dust in them.

345
00:31:44,556 --> 00:31:47,637
I see you're busy. I won't bother you.
I need to go get my medication.

346
00:31:49,516 --> 00:31:52,437
You benefited, but I'm the one
who got his piercing gaze.

347
00:31:52,756 --> 00:31:54,796
Alright. Thanks for your hard work.
Come back soon.

348
00:31:56,677 --> 00:31:59,276
What was he thinking? Saying his eyes
are big? Who would believe that?

349
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,337
It's better for girls to be
a bit chubby.

350
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:02,947
Tell me what you want to eat
in the future.

351
00:32:03,152 --> 00:32:03,952
Thanks for waiting.

352
00:32:05,197 --> 00:32:06,157
Have you finished?

353
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:19,356
Sheng is still at university,
but she's multi-talented.

354
00:32:19,836 --> 00:32:22,556
She can not only sing,
but she can also compose music.

355
00:32:22,637 --> 00:32:24,717
I know. Her songwriting is impressive.

356
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:28,116
Right, what's the name
of your music studio?

357
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:34,516
- Zhaozhaomumu Music Studio.
- Yes, she has a studio.

358
00:32:34,836 --> 00:32:37,648
Do you know?
Last month in Yangshuo, Guilin,

359
00:32:37,648 --> 00:32:41,008
a big event live-streamed online
was held.

360
00:32:41,008 --> 00:32:46,036
- Mom.
- That was awesome, with many audience.

361
00:32:46,157 --> 00:32:48,917
- I know. I watched it as well.
- You watched it too?

362
00:32:49,516 --> 00:32:54,437
Sheng asked me to watch the live stream,
and you even performed on stage, right?

363
00:32:54,637 --> 00:32:56,836
Yes, you even sang a song.

364
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:03,157
- Right, I thought you didn't have time.
- I had just gotten off work then.

365
00:33:04,197 --> 00:33:06,316
How could I not watch
when you were singing?

366
00:33:07,836 --> 00:33:12,076
The songs she composed and wrote
are all in the traditional style.

367
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,756
Yes, she saved a few on my computer.
I listen to them often.

368
00:33:15,397 --> 00:33:18,397
Because working at the hospital
is usually tiring and busy.

369
00:33:18,756 --> 00:33:22,677
Listening to her songs relaxes me a lot.
It's a very nice pastime.

370
00:33:23,677 --> 00:33:26,237
You know to balance work
and rest. That's good.

371
00:33:28,237 --> 00:33:30,737
Before, I didn't know
about the traditional music.

372
00:33:30,737 --> 00:33:34,356
But Sheng would play her compositions
for me every time she finished them.

373
00:33:34,717 --> 00:33:39,877
I listened and found them more pleasant
than the songs I used to listen to.

374
00:33:40,237 --> 00:33:41,596
Yes, they are quite pleasant.

375
00:33:42,717 --> 00:33:44,957
- You're chatting here.
- You're done?

376
00:33:45,596 --> 00:33:46,516
- Auntie.
- Yes.

377
00:33:47,596 --> 00:33:48,877
- Let's leave then.
- Okay.

378
00:33:49,477 --> 00:33:52,197
- Check, please.
- I'll pay for it.

379
00:33:52,356 --> 00:33:53,197
No.

380
00:33:55,997 --> 00:33:56,912
The taxi has arrived.

381
00:33:57,677 --> 00:33:58,556
Watch your step.

382
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,076
- Be careful.
- Thank you.

383
00:34:11,437 --> 00:34:14,676
I'll go to the branch hospital.
Let me know when you get home.

384
00:34:19,156 --> 00:34:25,116
This meeting was too casual.
Next time, I will make a formal visit.

385
00:34:28,636 --> 00:34:29,556
I want to say

386
00:34:30,797 --> 00:34:32,076
I am serious about our relationship

387
00:34:33,797 --> 00:34:36,317
with marriage as the goal.

388
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:47,596
Good.

389
00:34:48,676 --> 00:34:49,196
Good.

390
00:34:50,917 --> 00:34:51,877
I'm leaving.

391
00:34:55,877 --> 00:34:56,556
Goodbye, Mrs. Gu.

392
00:34:59,236 --> 00:34:59,676
I'm leaving.

393
00:35:04,076 --> 00:35:06,877
Sister, this man looks really good.

394
00:35:10,877 --> 00:35:14,156
- He can match Sheng.
- Right.

395
00:35:14,716 --> 00:35:18,236
- Mom, Auntie, let's go.
- Okay, go.

396
00:35:18,236 --> 00:35:20,516
Let's go.

397
00:35:22,477 --> 00:35:23,477
Get in, darling.

398
00:35:36,477 --> 00:35:40,477
Right, just now, I asked Dr. Zhao
during the prenatal check.

399
00:35:40,797 --> 00:35:45,997
He spoke highly of him. Hardworking,
skilled, and of good character.

400
00:35:46,036 --> 00:35:46,757
Really?

401
00:35:49,076 --> 00:35:54,236
- Would your inquiry affect his work?
- He didn't know our relationship.

402
00:35:54,877 --> 00:35:56,477
- That's true.
- Right.

403
00:35:56,917 --> 00:35:58,116
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

404
00:35:58,277 --> 00:36:01,357
Stop, sir! Stop!

405
00:36:01,716 --> 00:36:05,456
- What happened?
- Won't your husband come to pick us up?

406
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:07,119
How did we get in the taxi?

407
00:36:08,757 --> 00:36:12,636
- Yeah.
- Sir, please drive them back.

408
00:36:12,636 --> 00:36:15,556
Mom, you take auntie home.
I can look after the supermarket myself.

409
00:36:15,797 --> 00:36:19,277
Don't. Didn't we agree
we'd go to the supermarket together?

410
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:22,477
- Don't worry. I can manage on my own.
- Sheng.

411
00:36:22,596 --> 00:36:25,196
I can do it. I'd rather look after
the supermarket on my own.

412
00:36:27,556 --> 00:36:30,716
- The girl.
- Sheng is being shy.

413
00:37:06,556 --> 00:37:09,036
Yao. Can I ask you something?

414
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:14,236
- Go ahead.
- If a friend invites you to a bookstore

415
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,560
but the bookstore is in the suburbs,
what's the reason?

416
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:20,196
- Why?
- Yeah, why?

417
00:37:20,357 --> 00:37:23,716
- Why?
- I'm asking you. Why are you asking me?

418
00:37:26,596 --> 00:37:31,997
Mao, would it be too much trouble
for her to go to that suburban campus?

419
00:37:33,036 --> 00:37:37,596
Anyway, it's in the suburbs.
Isn't it too far?

420
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:42,196
That's why I selected
that place. Understand?

421
00:37:42,676 --> 00:37:47,997
I asked her to meet at the campus.
We could buy some books there.

422
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:52,757
Then I'll give her the pictures. Later,
we could take the school bus back.

423
00:37:53,317 --> 00:37:56,877
Swaying on the school bus.
Isn't it romantic?

424
00:37:57,957 --> 00:37:58,757
A man or a woman?

425
00:38:04,317 --> 00:38:05,397
A man.

426
00:38:06,397 --> 00:38:11,556
- Pursuing you.
- No. I guess many girls like him.

427
00:38:11,716 --> 00:38:12,957
Just a friend.

428
00:38:16,036 --> 00:38:20,317
Asking you out to buy books.
Quite interesting.

429
00:38:21,556 --> 00:38:24,516
He's somewhat interested in you.

430
00:38:29,317 --> 00:38:31,877
Why is it in the suburbs?

431
00:38:36,757 --> 00:38:38,196
- Is it romantic?
- Isn't it romantic?

432
00:38:39,357 --> 00:38:40,357
Yes, it is.

433
00:38:41,877 --> 00:38:43,437
I think so too.

434
00:38:48,236 --> 00:38:50,997
- I must say, you knit very well.
- The thread.

435
00:38:51,437 --> 00:38:54,477
If I have a daughter in the future,
make one for her too, okay?

436
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,556
Let's see
how romantic you are today first.

437
00:39:00,477 --> 00:39:03,556
For your work,
I must be romantic, right?

438
00:39:07,593 --> 00:39:11,248
(Red Whale Book Club)

439
00:39:38,636 --> 00:39:39,076
You're here.

440
00:39:41,076 --> 00:39:42,352
Do you listen to vinyl records?

441
00:39:43,236 --> 00:39:47,596
We have a player in our studio. Everyone
takes turns buying records every week.

442
00:39:48,516 --> 00:39:49,516
Do you like to listen too?

443
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:51,716
I've never listened before.

444
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:56,196
So many records.

445
00:39:57,397 --> 00:40:00,880
I remember when I was little,
I saw an old movie.

446
00:40:01,296 --> 00:40:04,116
There was a girl who had a whole wall
of records like this.

447
00:40:04,516 --> 00:40:08,036
Back then, I thought when I grew up,
I'd have a wall like this too.

448
00:40:09,036 --> 00:40:11,824
Later on, MP3 players came along.

449
00:40:12,464 --> 00:40:14,477
Right. People started listening to songs
on their computers.

450
00:40:14,636 --> 00:40:17,072
It's all digital listening
on the phone now.

451
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,088
Fewer and fewer people
listen to vinyl records.

452
00:40:19,196 --> 00:40:21,236
How did you know
that's exactly what I wanted to say?

453
00:40:23,156 --> 00:40:24,957
Do you know why I like
listening to vinyl records?

454
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,267
Is it because you appreciate the arts,
the retro vibe,

455
00:40:29,267 --> 00:40:31,317
or is it because
the sound quality is better?

456
00:40:32,837 --> 00:40:35,056
Because vinyl records
are physically inscribed.

457
00:40:35,056 --> 00:40:38,837
Factors such as
turntable speed and air humidity

458
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:42,156
make each listening experience
different.

459
00:40:43,156 --> 00:40:45,957
It's different every time
you listen to the same song?

460
00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:49,116
Theoretically,
there are subtle differences.

461
00:40:50,757 --> 00:40:51,917
That's quite romantic.

462
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:55,957
Do you want to try it?

463
00:40:57,676 --> 00:41:00,196
Is classical okay? Come with me.

464
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:28,688
Hearing what you just said,

465
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,757
I truly feel vinyl records are magical
and have a sense of ceremony.

466
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:34,556
If you like it, you're welcome
to come to the studio to listen.

467
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,196
Do you want to read books now?

468
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:41,156
Okay.

469
00:41:44,516 --> 00:41:46,196
Sir, please save the two
by Chopin for me.

470
00:41:46,556 --> 00:41:47,437
- Okay.
- Thank you.

472
00:42:53,636 --> 00:42:54,437
It's your signature.

473
00:42:57,757 --> 00:42:58,236
Look at this.

474
00:43:02,236 --> 00:43:02,757
Let me look.

475
00:43:03,422 --> 00:43:04,720
(During a Blizzard)

476
00:43:07,277 --> 00:43:08,976
This is a book published
by a friend of mine last year.

477
00:43:08,976 --> 00:43:10,516
We helped sign a few hundred copies.

478
00:43:10,837 --> 00:43:14,077
The signatures are random.
Everyone in our studio signed.

479
00:43:14,077 --> 00:43:14,837
I'll buy it.

480
00:43:15,877 --> 00:43:17,392
If you like autographed books,

481
00:43:17,392 --> 00:43:19,156
I can go back to the studio
and sign any book for you.

482
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:21,040
No, I'll buy it myself.

483
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,800
I just happen not to
have read this book yet.

484
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,676
Consider it support for your friend.

485
00:43:26,076 --> 00:43:28,757
I just happened to pick it.
It must be destined for me to buy it.

486
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:30,917
